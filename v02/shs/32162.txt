{#मेरु#}¦ m. ({#-रुः#}) 1. The sacred mountain Meru, in the centre of the seven
<>continents, compared to the cup or seed-vessel of the lotus, the
<>leaves of which are formed by the different Dwipas: its height
<>is said by the Hindus to be 84,000 Yojanas, sixteen thousand
<>of which are below the surface of the earth: the shape is various-
<>ly described, as square, conical, columnar, spherical, or spiral;
<>and the four faces of it are of various colours, or white towards
<>the east, yellow to the south, black to the west, and red towards
<>the north: the river Ganges falls from heaven on its summit,
<>and flows thence to the surrounding worlds in four streams; the
<>southern branch is the Ganges of India, the northern running into
<>Tartary is the Bhadrasomā, the eastern is the Sitā, and the wes-
<>tern the Chacshu or Oxus: on the summit of Meru BRAHMĀ re-
<>sides attended and worshipped by the Rishis, Gandharbas, &c.;
<>the regents of the points of the compass occupy the correspond-
<>ing faces of the mountain, the whole of which consists of gold and
<>gems: considered in any but a fabulous light, mount Meru
<>appears to mean the high land of Tartary, immediately to the
<>north of the Himālaya mountains. 2. The central bead in a rosary.
<>3. The middle gem in a necklace. E. {#मि#} to scatter, (radiance,)
<>Unādi aff. {#रु#}.
