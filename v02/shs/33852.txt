and ordered his sons to cut off her head; and one of them PARA-
SŪRĀMA with explicit obedience to his father's command beheaded
her; but her husband was so much pleased with the dutifulness
of his son that he restored her to life at the request of his son
PARASŪRĀMA. 3. A sort of pulse, (Ervum or Cicer lens.) E. {#रेणु#}
