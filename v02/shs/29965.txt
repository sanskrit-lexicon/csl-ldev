{#मकर#}¦ m. ({#-रः#}) 1. A marine monster, confounded usually with the
<>crocodile and shark, but properly a fabulous animal: as a fish it
<>might be conjectured to be the horned-shark, or the unicorn fish;
<>but it is often drawn, as it in the pictured sign Capricornus of the
<>zodiac, with the head and forelegs of an antelope, and the body
<>and tail of a fish: it is the emblem of the god of love. 2. One of
<>the signs of zodiac, corresponding with the above, and like
<>the Greek representation of that sign, being an animal in
<>the foreparts, and ending in the tail of a fish. One of the nine
<>treasures of KUVERA. 3. A particular array of troops, in the form
<>of a Makara. 4. An ear-ring in that shape. E. {#म#} for {#मुख#} the mouth,
<>{#कृ#} to scatter, aff. {#अच्;#} or {#माङ्#} prohibitive aff., {#कृ#} to do, {#अच्#} aff.,
<>form irr.; grammarians however, sometimes consider this word
<>as a primitive.
