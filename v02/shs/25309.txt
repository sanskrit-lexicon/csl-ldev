{#पुराण#}¦ n. ({#-णं#}) A Purāṇa or sacred poetical work, supposed to be
compiled or composed by the poet VYĀSA; and comprising the
whole body of Hindu theology: each Purāṇa should treat of five
topics especially; the creation, the destruction and renovation of
worlds; the genealogy of gods and heroes; the reigns of the
Manus, and the transaction of their descendants: but great variety
prevails in this respect and few contain historical or genealogical
matter. There are eighteen acknowledged Purāṇas. 1. BRAHMA.
2. Padma, or the lotus. 3. Brahmāṇḍa, or the egg of BRAHMĀ.
4. Āgneya, or Agni, fire. 5. VAISHNAVA, or of VISHṆU. 6. Garu-
da. 7. Brahmavaivarta, or transformations of BRAHMĀ, that is of
KRISHṆA, identified with the Supreme. 8. SAIVA, or of ŚIVA. 9.
Linga. 10. NĀRADĪYA. 11. SKANDA. 12. MĀRKAṆḌEYA, so called
from a Muni of that name. 13. Bhavishyat, or prophetic. 14.
Matsya, or the fish. 15. Varāha, or boar. 16. Kaurma, or of the
Kurma or tortoise. 17. Vāmana, or dwarf. 18. Bhāgavat, or
life of KRISHṆA, which last is by some considered as a spurious
and modern work: the Brahmavaivarta is also of very modern
origin. The Purāṇas ars reckoned to contain four hundred
thousand stanzas: there are also eighteen Upapurāṇas or similar
poems of inferior sanctity, and different appellations: the whole
constitute the popular or poetical creed of the Hindus, and some
of them or particular parts of them, are very generally read, and
studied. m. ({#-णः#}) A karsha or measure of silver equal to sixteen
Panas of Cowries. mfn. ({#-णः-णा#} or {#-णी-णं#}) Old, ancient. E. {#पुरा#} old,
and {#द्यु#} aff. or {#पुरा#} the same, {#णी#} to get or be, and {#ड#} aff.
