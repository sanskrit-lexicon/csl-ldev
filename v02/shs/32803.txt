{#योग#}¦ m. ({#-गः#}) 1. Junction, joining, union. 2. Combination, association,
<>meeting, conflux. 3. Religious and abstract meditation. 4. Keep-
<>ing the body in a fixed posture. 5. Devotion, spiritual worship of
<>GOD, or union with the Supreme Being by means of abstract
<>contemplation; this does not necessarily imply an abandonment
<>of the world or relinquishment of the usual observances of re-
<>ligion, but it involves internal indifference to objects of pleasure
<>and pain, and utter disregard of the consequences or fruit of
<>ceremonial rites. 6. The particular practice of the preceding sort
<>of devotion, or the exercise of that abstraction by which union
<>with God is supposed to be obtained; in the Gītā it is described
<>as sitting on Kuśa grass, with the body firm, the eyes fixed on
<>the tip of the nose, and the mind intent on the Deity; in the Tan-
<>tras a fanciful operation is prescribed, by which the vital spirit sea-
<>ted in the lower part of the body, and the etherial spirit placed in
<>the head, are supposed to be brought into combination in the
<>brain, when the devotee becomes united with BRAHMĀ. 7. The sys-
<>tem of philosophy which treats of the union of the soul with BRAH-
<>MĀ or GOD; it is the same as the Patanjalī doctrine, and consti-
<>tutes one of the six Darshanas or philosophical schools of the
<>Hindus. 8. Magic, or the acquisition of supernatural powers by the
<>mystical and magical worship of ŚIVA and DURGĀ especially. 9.
<>Consequence, result, the main end or object of any thing or act.
<>10. Connection of one thing with another, as of cause with effect,
<>predicate with subject, quality with substance, &c. 11. Acquisi-
<>tion of something not possessed before, accession of property or
<>wealth; in grammar this application is assigned to any unusual
<>construction of words or compounds, unauthorised by rule, but
<>sanctioned by the authority that employs them. 12. A rule, an
<>aphorism. 13. Propriety, fitness. 14. Side, part, cause or argument
<>to be maintained or defended. 15. Thing, substance. 16. Wealth.
<>17. A drug, a medicament, especially a compound of various, in-
<>gredients. 18. Fraud, trick. 19. A logician. 20. A spy, an informer.
<>21. A violator of truth or confidence. 22. A conveyance, a carriage,
<>a boat, &c. 23. A means, an expedient. 24. Armour. 25. Putting
<>on armour. 26. Lucky conjuncture. 27. (In arithmetic,) Addition.
<>28. (In astronomy,) The leading or principal star of a lunar man-
<>sion. 29. The twenty-seventh part of 3600 of a great circle measur-
<>ed on the plane of the ecliptic, and used in calculating the longitu-
<>des of the sun and moon; each Yoga has a distinct name; as-
<>trologers also enumerate twenty-eight Yogas differently named
<>from the foregoing, and corresponding with the twenty-eight Nak-
<>shatras, or the divisions of the moon's path, but varying accor-
<>ding to the day of the week. 30. A period, or the time during
<>which the sum of the motions of the sun and moon amount to one
<>Nakshatra, the mean duration of which is 23hs. 474 4444. E. {#युज्#}
