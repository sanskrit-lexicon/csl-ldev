{#यजुस्#}¦ n. ({#-जुः#}) The Yajur or Yajush, one of the four Vedas; it is di-
<>vided into two principal portions, the white and black, or Vāja-
<>saneyi and Taittirīya, the former of which is attributed to the
<>saint YĀJNAWALKYA, to whom it was revealed by the sun, in
<>the form of a horse; and the latter to TAITTIRI, to whom it
<>was communicated by YĀSKA, the first pupil of its original
<>author, the sage VAIŚAMPĀYANA: according to the Purāṇas
<>the Taittirīya portion was named from Tittiri a partridge;
<>the disciples of VAIŚAMPĀYANA being changed into those birds,
<>to pick up the texts of the Veda as they were disgorged in a
<>tangible shape by YĀJNAWALKYA, at the command of VAIŚAM-
<>PĀYANA: both portions of this Veda are very full on the sub-
<>ject of religious rites, and the prayers peculiar to it, are chiefly
<>in measured and poetical prose. E. {#यज्#} to worship, Unādi aff. {#उसि ।#}
