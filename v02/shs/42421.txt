{#सपिण्ड#}¦ m. ({#-ण्डः#}) A kinsman, especially one connected by the offering
of the funeral cake to either or all of the manes of the father,
grandfather, and great-grandfather, and their wives respectively,
as sprung from them in directly collateral lines; the relationship
stops with every fourth person, as the fifth cannot perform the offer-
ing of a cake to the father even of the deceased. The following are
enumerated as Sapiṇḍās:--the son, son's son, and son's grandson;
[Page759-b+ 60]
widow, daughter and daughter's son; the father, the mother, the
brother, brother's son, and brother's grandson; father's daughter's
son; father's brother's son and grandson; paternal grandfather's
daughter's son; paternal grandfather; paternal grandmother,
paternal grandfather's brother, brother's son and grandson; and
lastly the great grandfather's daughter's son: these all
present oblations in which the deceased is either included,
or may participate: other enumerations, including the oblations
he was bound to offer, &c. extend the connection of Sapiṇḍa to
seven persons both in an ascending or descending line. E. {#स#} for
{#ससान#} common, and {#पिण्ड#} ball of meat, &c., offered to the manes
of the deceased ancestors, at the Śrāddhas performed in honour
of them.
