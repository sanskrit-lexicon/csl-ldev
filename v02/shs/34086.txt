<>tended also to the island, which according to the notions of the
<>Hindus, is much more considerable in size, and lies further from
<>the continent than in reality; it is described as being equal to
<>one-twelvth of the equatorial circumference of the earth, and is
<>one of the places lying under the first meridian, whence the
<>longitude is computed; it is thus placed in the Eastern ocean,
<>South of Ceylon, and according to WILFORD is the peninsula of
<>Malacca: according to some Hindu accounts also, it is distinct
<>from Ceylon, from which island Lankā is said to be just visible.
<>2. A goddess or evil spirit, one of the Śākinīs, perhaps the same
<>as the tutelary deity of the city of Lankā. 3. An unchaste woman.
<>4. A branch. 5. A kind of grain. E. {#लक्#} to obtain, (happiness, in
<>which,) aff. {#अच्,#} and {#नुम्#} irr. augment.
