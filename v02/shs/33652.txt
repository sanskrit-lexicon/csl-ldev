{#राहु#}¦ m. ({#-हुः#}) The ascending node; in mythology, the son of VIPRACHITTI
by SINHIKĀ, a Daitya, with the tail of a dragon, whose head was
severed from his body by VISHṆU, on the information of the sun
and the moon who caught him in the act of drinking Amrita which
was being served to gods, but being immortal by tasting it, his
head and tail retained their separate existence, and being transferred
[Page605-a+ 60]
to the stellar sphere, became the authors of eclipses; the first
especially, by endeavouring at various times to swallow the sun
and the moon to wreak his vengeance. E. {#रह्#} to abandon, (the
planets which it has vainly attempted to devour,) aff. {#उण्,#} and the
vowel made long.
