{@? dardurā@}¦ (most mss. dardarā), sc. lipi, a kind of
<div n="lb">script: Mv i.135.7. Senart's note mentions this as one of
<div n="lb">the forms in the list which ‘ne laissent guère d'incertitude’;
<div n="lb">to me it is by no means clear. Did Senart mean to associate
<div n="lb">it with the Skt. name of the mountain range, often asso-
<div n="lb">ciated with Malaya? As a mountain name. Dardara (rare
<div n="lb">and doubtful in Skt., but in Pali Daddara) would merit
<div n="lb">consideration, as supported by most mss. But one would
<div n="lb">not expect a mountain-name here.
