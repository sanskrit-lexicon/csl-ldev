<L>6482<pc>238,2<k1>जम्बुकाञ्चन<k2>जम्बु-काञ्चन, जम्बू°
{@jambu-kāñcana, jambū°@}¦, prob. to be read, with
<div n="lb">two mss. in first passage, for jāmbu° in LV 122.15 ekā
<div n="lb">kākini jāmbu-kāñcane bhavati upahatā, and 17 jām-
<div n="lb">būkāñcanasaṃnibhā punar bhavet sakara iya mahī
<div n="lb">(both vss); the mg. seems evidently {%gold from the Jambu%}
<div n="lb">{%river%}, and it is hard to believe that ā in the first syllable
<div n="lb">is anything but a corruption (if an adjectival form, it
<div n="lb">should be jāmbava; the ā of jāmbunada, jāmbū°, is justi-
<div n="lb">fied because that is derived from °nadī with suffix -a).
