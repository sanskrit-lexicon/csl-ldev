{@eḍaka-rajas@}¦ (= {@avi-rajas@}, q.v.), lit. {%sheep-speck%}, a
<div n="lb">small unit of matter; like avi-rajas Mvy 8195, it occurs
<div n="lb">LV 149.6 and Divy 645.11 in tabular lists of very small
<div n="lb">weights or measures; in all three, seven {@śaśa-rajāṃsi@}
<div n="lb">(q.v.) make one eḍaka-(avi-)r° and seven of these make
<div n="lb">one {@go-rajas@} (q.v.). Acc. to St. Julien, cited by Weber
<div n="lb">ISt. 8.436 note, the mg. is said by Hiuen Ts'ang and a
<div n="lb">Chin. transl. of LV to be {%a grain of dust on the hide of a%}
<div n="lb">{%hare (sheep, beeve)%}. But Tib. on both Mvy and LV says
<div n="lb">simply {%hare- (sheep-, cow-) speck%} (rdul); to be sure, Das
<div n="lb">s.v. rdul declares that glaṅ rdul means {%a mote in the dung%}
<div n="lb">{%of an ox, a small particle of cowdung%}. But this, as well as
<div n="lb">the different guess from Chin., can hardly be anything
<div n="lb">but implausible guesswork. Why should a speck on the
<div n="lb">skin, or in the dung, of an animal vary with the size of
<div n="lb">the animal? The Tib. itself gives no such indication. It
<div n="lb">seems safe to assume that {%hare-speck, sheep-speck%}, and
<div n="lb">{%cow-speck%} mean only three different sizes of small par-
<div n="lb">ticles.
