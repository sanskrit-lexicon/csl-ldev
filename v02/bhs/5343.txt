{@kṣatra@}¦ (nt.) = kṣetra, {%field%}. Cf. Pali DN 3.93.13
khettānaṃ patī ti…khattiyo (in an etymology), which
shows that a popular association of kṣatriya with kṣetra
(or of their MIndic equivalents) existed. Doubtless as
a result of this, the secondary etymological blend-form
kṣatra occurs often in LV, as in 208.13; 283.8; 352.18;
354.14, 22; 355.16; 357.4; 366.8; in all these all mss. and
Lefm. kṣa°; in LV 290.8, 15; 353.1 Lefm. kṣe° but most
mss. kṣa°. The mss. of Mv also--sometimes nearly all
of them--read kṣa°, as in v.l. for kṣe° at i.121.9, 11, 12;
122.1, 2. In all these cases there is no doubt of the mg.
{%field%}; it seems to me that Lefm. was right in recognizing
the existence in BHS of kṣatra in this sense, because of
its frequent occurrence, which the etym. in DN supports.
