{@vāsī-candana-kalpa@}¦, adj. (= AMg. vāsī-candaṇa-
<div n="lb">kappa, see below), a stock ep. of an arhat; in effect,
<div n="lb">{%indifferent%}; only in a cliché list of such epithets, always
<div n="lb">following (and in every case but one immediately) sama-
<div n="lb">loṣṭakāñcana and ākāśapāṇitalasamacitta, with other
<div n="lb">similar terms: Divy 97.26; 180.26 (here v.l. vālī°); 240.25;
<div n="lb">282.2; 551.19; MSV ii.131.3; Av i.96.7 (ms.); 104.7; 207.12,
<div n="lb">etc.; acc. to Ratnach., {%indifferent alike to being cut with%}
<div n="lb">{%a hatchet%} (Skt. vāśī, also written vāsī) {%or anointed with%}
<div n="lb">{%sandalwood paste%}; this is clearly the Jain traditional inter-
<div n="lb">pretation, misunderstood by Jacobi, SBE 45, p. 99, note 1;
<div n="lb">in transl. of Kalpa Sūtra 119 Jacobi renders vāsī by
[Page479-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">{%ordure%}, and Charpentier on Uttarādh. 19.92 also thinks
<div n="lb">it means something ill-smelling, in contrast with sandal;
<div n="lb">they both agree with the Jain tradition in understanding
<div n="lb">kalpa as {%indifferent to%} (pairs of opposites, like Skt. sama);
<div n="lb">perhaps this is right, but if so I know of no parallel for it;
<div n="lb">ordinary usage, both Skt. and MIndic, would make it
<div n="lb">mean {%like, resembling…%}; in this case, possibly, {%resembling%}
<div n="lb">{%a knife or sandalwood%} in ‘coldness’, dispassionate nature?.
<div n="lb">So in effect Feer, Av transl. p. 14, {%il était devenu froid%}
<div n="lb">{%comme le sandal%}; but Feer omits vāsī!
