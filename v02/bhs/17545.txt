{@? svayaṃ@}¦, interpreted by Senart twice as prior mem-
<div n="lb">ber of cpds. in mg. {%own%}, = Skt. sva(ka), adj., for which
<div n="lb">saya, adj., is common in AMg.; I could hardly accept
<div n="lb">Senart's interpretation except on the assumption that the
<div n="lb">word is a form of that MIndic adj.; cf. conversely {@svakam@},
<div n="lb">acc. to Senart = svayam. I can however not regard the
<div n="lb">interpretation as certain. In Mv i.284.4 (prose), kumāro
<div n="lb">brahmacārī svayam (perh. svaya-with m Hiatus-bridger?)-
<div n="lb">āśrame (mss. °maṃ) paryaṅkena niṣaṇṇo, svayam could
<div n="lb">be taken in its ordinary Skt. sense, {%(the youth) himself%},
<div n="lb">rather than {%in his own hermitage%} with Senart. In i.302.6
<div n="lb">(prose), Senart by em. svayaṃdhītā saṃveditā, {%he spoke%}
<div n="lb">{%to his own daughter%}; if it means this, I should read svayā,
<div n="lb">or (Skt.) svakā, or possibly svaya- (in comp.), dhītā; the
[Page616-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">mss. read svajanaṃ dhītā saṃviditā; could this (taking
<div n="lb">svajanaṃ as nom.) mean {%his people%} (and specifically) {%his%}
<div n="lb">{%daughter was admonished?%} Undoubtedly his daughter alone
<div n="lb">is actually addressed in the following, evaṃ tuvaṃ…;
<div n="lb">and cf. svakā dhītā 304.8, in the verse version of the
<div n="lb">story; on the whole the mg. assumed by Senart is prob.
<div n="lb">to be accepted, but I question the form (= Skt. svayam).
