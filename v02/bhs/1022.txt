{@anuvidiś@}¦, f. (blend of Skt. vidiś and Pali anudisā),
<div n="lb">{%supplementary direction, semi-cardinal point%}, = vidiś, in
<div n="lb">Bcṭ 328.11 (= Śikṣ 245.18, where text na tu vidiśam); in
<div n="lb">Śikṣ 252.15 text correctly nānuvidiśaṃ (acc. sg.); in these
<div n="lb">adhaḥ and ūrdhvam are separately mentioned, as in AsP
<div n="lb">481.18--19 mordhvaṃ mādho mā cānuvidiśam avalokayan
<div n="lb">gāḥ; but for this fact, Sukh 36.11 could easily be taken to
<div n="lb">prove that anu° means specifically the nadir and zenith,
<div n="lb">since, after the 4 cardinal points (°paścimottarāsu dikṣu),
<div n="lb">it follows with adha ūrdhvam anuvidikṣu. But the above
<div n="lb">passages show that adha ūrdhvam in Sukh must not be
<div n="lb">taken with anu°, which must apparently mean instead {%the%}
<div n="lb">{%semicardinal points%} (not otherwise mentioned here).
