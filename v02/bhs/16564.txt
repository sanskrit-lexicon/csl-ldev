{@savara, (1)@}¦ m., a high number: Mvy 7785 (Tib.
<div n="lb">mchog ldan); no v.l.; also as v.l. for mavaraḥ or maparaḥ
<div n="lb">Mvy 7707 (in earlier part of the same list); ({@2@}) nt., a high
<div n="lb">number (but much smaller than °raḥ Mvy 7785): °ram
<div n="lb">Mvy 7833 (corresponding in position to Mvy 7707, and
<div n="lb">rendered in the same way in Tib., ban bun, differing thus
<div n="lb">from Mvy 7785); for this a v.l. {@mavaram@}, q.v., is recorded,
<div n="lb">and it seems quite clear that s- is a graphic error for m-;
<div n="lb">Mvy 7833 is cited from Gv 133.2 which reads {@maparam@},
<div n="lb">q.v.; in Gv 105.20 paramasya (gen.) is obviously another
<div n="lb">form of the same number, see {@parama@}.
