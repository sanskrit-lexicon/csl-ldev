1 {@anu@}¦, indecl. in noun and verb cpds.; (a) in distrib-
<div n="lb">utive (? or intensive) noun cpds., as in Pali, CPD s.v.
<div n="lb">anu (g); also in JM, e.g. gāmāṇugāmaṃ Jacobi Erz. 13.2;
<div n="lb">rare in Skt., ‘typical in Buddh.’, Renou, Gr. scte. p. 94:
<div n="lb">divasānudivasaṃ, adv., {%day after day%}, Av i.208.10; 261.14;
<div n="lb">see {@kālānukālam, kṣudrānukṣudra, kṣudrakānukṣu-@}
<div n="lb">{@draka, anucāra, anudharma@}; but the usage is not al-
<div n="lb">ways clear and the last-named, at least, prob. does not
<div n="lb">belong here; (b) in verb cpds. used in many cases which
<div n="lb">have no parallels in Skt., nor (often) even in Pali or Pkt.;
<div n="lb">usually before other preverbs. See the following entries
<div n="lb">in this work. Very often it is hard to see any definite
<div n="lb">meaning which anu adds; Tib. in its wooden way renders
<div n="lb">by rjes su, {%after%}, which as Jäschke says ‘is often not to
<div n="lb">be translated’.
