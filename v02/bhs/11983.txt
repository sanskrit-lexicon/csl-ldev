{@mānavaka@}¦ (sometimes written for Skt. māṇavaka,
<div n="lb">as LV 101.9 and 108.5, all mss.; f. mānavikānāṃ, perh.
<div n="lb">rather to Skt. mānava, mānavī, {%human being%}, Mv ii.432.4,
<div n="lb">used of king's wives), m. or nt., in Av i.265.7 is, or corruptly
<div n="lb">represents, a word meaning {%peg, post%}, or the like, for hanging
<div n="lb">clothes: yena…sā {@yamalī@} (q.v.) krītā, tena mānavake
<div n="lb">sthāpitā Av i.265.7; Tib. cited by Speyer as gdaṅ, which
<div n="lb">(or gdaṅ bu, Mvy 9037) = {@carpaṭaka@}, q.v. The context
<div n="lb">proves that this is approximately right in mg. But Speyer's
<div n="lb">suggestion that we em. tenārambhaṇake (should be
<div n="lb">°mbaṇake, see {@ārambaṇaka@}) is improbable; that word
<div n="lb">seems to mean a different kind of {%peg%}, tho also rendered
<div n="lb">by Tib. gdaṅ (bu). Could our word be related to AMg.
<div n="lb">māṇavaya, n. of a divine ‘caitya-stambha’ (see Ratnach.
<div n="lb">s.v.)?
