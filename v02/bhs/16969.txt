{@Sunirmita, (1)@}¦ m. (= Pali Sunimmita, cf. DN
<div n="lb">i.219.4), n. of the chief of the {@nirmāṇarati@} (also called
<div n="lb">{@nirmita@}) gods: LV 44.10; 59.6; 302.6; 362.18; 363.19;
<div n="lb">441.18; Mv i.208.13; 263.16; ii.11.1; iii.315.7; Divy 140.15;
<div n="lb">Mmk 45.8; 69.6; Bbh 345.22 (in Mvy {@Sunirmāṇarati@},
<div n="lb">q.v.); most occurrences which seem to suggest use in pl.,
<div n="lb">as of the class of nirmita (= nirmāṇarati) gods, are only
<div n="lb">apparent, see s.v. {@Suyāma@} for a number of cases in Gv,
<div n="lb">Dbh.g., and RP. However, I have noted two cases where
<div n="lb">the pl. seems unquestionable (unless we resort to emenda-
<div n="lb">tion), and can only mean the class of which (the sg.)
<div n="lb">Sunirmita is chief: sunirmitāṃ devaputrāṃ paśyati ca
<div n="lb">svalaṃkṛtāṃ Mv ii.360.4 (vs); and, in a list of classes
<div n="lb">of gods, …sunirmitā paranirmitā śuddhāvāsā tuṣitā
<div n="lb">yāmā… Mmk 19.12 (prose). (But in LV 241.2, for
<div n="lb">Sunirmiteṣu, read with best ms. Sunirmito sa, supported
<div n="lb">by Tib.) Perhaps the fact that nirmita is used of the class,
<div n="lb">but less regularly than nirmāṇarati, led to occasional
<div n="lb">confusion with the name of its chieftain: ({@2@}) nt., n. of a
<div n="lb">buddhakṣetra: Mv i.123.6 (vs); located in the east.
