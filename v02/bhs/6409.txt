<div n="lb">vaśībhāvaṃ chādayitavyaṃ manyeyā (the last part, from

<div n="lb">Senart thinks a form of {@chaḍḍeti@} must be read; but the
<div n="lb">Pali parallel SN ii.222.10 reads tālapattikāya chādetabbaṃ,
<div n="lb">(an elephant) {%to be covered with a palm-leaf%}, which proves
<div n="lb">chāditavyaṃ correct. Perhaps read before it (with the
<div n="lb">Pali) tāla-pattrikāye; possibly, however, tala-śaktikāye
<div n="lb">(closer to our mss.), {%with an upheld arm%} or {%hand%}, see s.v.
<div n="lb">{@talaśaktikā. (2)@} {%protects, helps, saves%} (cf. pw s.v. 6, {%schützen%}):
