<div n="lb">{%modesty, bashfulness%}: lajjā-°pya-saṃlīna-cetās Divy 255.16,
<div n="lb">hrī-°pya-gṛhītā 23 (here the bashfulness of love); {%shame%}
<div n="lb">of an evil deed, (śikṣāvyatikrame) °pyam utpadyate Bbh
<div n="lb">137.20; in this sense in cpd. hrī-°pya, °pyaṃ prāviṣkaroti
<div n="lb">Bbh 6.1; similarly 137.25 f.; 159.14; 180.2; 250.8 (katamad
<div n="lb">bodhisattvānāṃ hrī-vyapatrāpyaṃ); a distinction between
<div n="lb">hrī and vyapa° is made in Bbh 250.10--12, where both are
<div n="lb">glossed lajjā, but hrī is said to mean the feeling that a
<div n="lb">blameworthy act is unworthy of oneself, vyapatrāpya
<div n="lb">is the feeling caused thereby thru fear or respect of others.
<div n="lb">Is this anything more than a commentator's ad-hoc
<div n="lb">attempt at subtlety ? In AbidhK. LaV-P. ii.172 hrī is
<div n="lb">defined in a way suggesting rather vyapatrāpya of
<div n="lb">Bbh.
