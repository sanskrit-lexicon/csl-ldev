{@sattvāvāsa@}¦, m. (= Pali sattāvāsa), {%abode of beings%}.
<div n="lb">Nine such are listed Mvy 2288--97 and in Pali DN iii.263.9 ff.;
<div n="lb">in both lists an example only (not an exhaustive enu-
<div n="lb">meration) is cited under each ‘abode’. The first includes
<div n="lb">all men and lower beings, and the kāmāvacara gods; the
<div n="lb">2d, 3d, and 4th are the gods of the 1st, 2d, and 3d dhyāna-
<div n="lb">bhūmi (of the rūpāvacara gods); then in Mvy come as
<div n="lb">Nos. 5--8 incl. the 4 classes of arūpāvacara gods, and
<div n="lb">finally as an example of No. 9 the {@asaṃjñisattva@} (q.v.)
<div n="lb">gods; but this arrangement is certainly erroneous; DN
<div n="lb">iii.263.19 correctly puts the asaññasatta gods (who belong
<div n="lb">to the 4th dhyānabhūmi of rūpāvacara) in the 5th satt(v)ā-
<div n="lb">vāsa (the śuddhāvāsakāyika doubtless belong here too),
<div n="lb">while the four arūpāvacara classes constitute the 6th to
<div n="lb">9th incl. In Mvy the first four are characterized respectively
<div n="lb">as nānātvakāyā nānātvasaṃjñinaḥ, nānātvakāyā ekatva-
<div n="lb">saṃjñinaḥ, ekatvakāyā nānātvasaṃjñinaḥ, ekatvakāyā
<div n="lb">ekatvasaṃjñinaḥ. Cf. AbhidhK. LaV-P. iii.22, n. 4.
