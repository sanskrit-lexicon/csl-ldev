{@Śuklodana@}¦ (Pali Sukko°), n. of a brother of Śuddho-
<div n="lb">dana: Mv i.352.13; 355.19; iii.176.14 (father of Ānanda,
<div n="lb">Upadhāna, and Devadatta); Mvy 3600. In Mv iii.177.1,
<div n="lb">acc. to mss., another Śuklodana, also brother of Śuddho-
<div n="lb">dana, is named (just after iii.176.14 above), as the father
<div n="lb">of Nandana and Nandika (v.l. Nandaka); Senart em. to
<div n="lb">Śukrodana, referring to Kern, Der Buddhismus 310, who
<div n="lb">alleges among Śuddhodana's brothers, besides Śuklodana,
<div n="lb">also ‘Śukrodana or Śuklodana’. The source of Kern's
<div n="lb">statement is not clear to me; it would have to be a northern
<div n="lb">(Skt. or BHS) text; both forms would be Sukkodana in
<div n="lb">MIndic. In any case I think that Mv iii.177.1 has carelessly
<div n="lb">substituted a repetition of Śuklo° for Dhautodana of
<div n="lb">i.352.13 and 355.20 (or Droṇodana of Mvy 3601), the
<div n="lb">correct name of the fourth of the brothers, otherwise
<div n="lb">missing in this passage.
