{@ānta@}¦, adj. (cited in MW without reference; not in
<div n="lb">BR or pw or Schmidt; Skt. back-formation, or error,
<div n="lb">based on Pali anta = Skt. antya; cf. {@antaka@}), {%ultimate,%}
<div n="lb">{%final, extreme, supreme%}: Kv 89.6 āntas tvaṃ kulaputra
<div n="lb">kṛtas te sattvaparīpākaḥ, {%you are a supreme one…%} (it
<div n="lb">would seem more natural, if only tvaṃ were omitted, to
<div n="lb">make āntas agree with sattvaparīpākaḥ; perhaps the
<div n="lb">passage is corrupt).
