<div n="lb">{%wish, vow%}; sometimes (but rarely) of purely worldly
<div n="lb">desires, which are reprobated, praṇidhāna-vivarjitam SP
<div n="lb">142.8 (vs); usually religious at least in basis, fulfilment
<div n="lb">being expected on the ground of acts of merit, which are
<div n="lb">often mentioned in a solemn declaration of wish; the thing
<div n="lb">desired may nevertheless be worldly (wealth, or special
<div n="lb">marks of grace), tho often the intention is stated to use
<div n="lb">it for religious-purposes: Mv i.302.19 (magic possession of
