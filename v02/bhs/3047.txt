[{@āśu:@}¦ Johnston, notes on Saundarān. vi.9 and Buddhac.
<div n="lb">vi.64, assumes use as ‘expletive’, ‘to strengthen the force
<div n="lb">of the verb,’ ‘in epic and Buddhist Skt.,’ and suggests
<div n="lb">relation to the Pali particle assu. He so interprets āśu
<div n="lb">in Manu 4.171. I disagree on all this; it seems to me that
<div n="lb">there is no reason to assume any āśu except the adj. and
<div n="lb">adverb, {%quick(ly)%}. Tib. renders {%quickly%} at Buddhac. vi.64.]
