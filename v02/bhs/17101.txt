{@surati@}¦ (f.; cf. AMg. surai, surati; Skt. and Pali
<div n="lb">surata), {%sexual enjoyment, lust%}: in Mv ii.63.4 (vs) read,
<div n="lb">nearly with mss., vipuṇya-mānā suratī-(mss. cited as °bhi,
<div n="lb">°bhir, a graphic corruption, cf. {@saurabhya@} for {@sauratya@})-
<div n="lb">upadrutā, hirir nivāreti svacittam ātmano, {%Modesty re-%}
<div n="lb">{%strains women of unvirtuous conceit (caprice, jealousy?)%}
<div n="lb">{%who are afflicted with lust%}; the Jāt. parallel, v.410.13--20,
<div n="lb">tho only loose, is close enough to show that the author is
<div n="lb">speaking of Hrī restraining lustful women. Senart mis-
<div n="lb">understands and em. wildly.
