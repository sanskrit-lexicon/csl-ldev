{@Saṃjñāya@}¦ (mss. mostly Saṃjaya, but Tib. yaṅ dag
<div n="lb">śes, supporting Nobel's reading), n. of a yakṣa prince or
<div n="lb">commander (senāpati): Suv 85.1; 91.16; 128.3 ff. (chap. XI,
<div n="lb">°ya-parivarta); 158.13 (here called janarṣabhaḥ, so read
<div n="lb">with best mss., others nararṣabhaḥ; Nobel's jinarṣabhaḥ,
<div n="lb">based on Tib., seems to me clearly wrong, cf. Nobel's
<div n="lb">note 14 above where N. corrects the same Tib. reading;
<div n="lb">context proves that a yakṣa, not a Buddha, is meant);
<div n="lb">161.7.
