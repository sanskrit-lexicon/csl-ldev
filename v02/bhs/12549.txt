{@? rajojala@}¦, nt., Mv iii.412.17 (vs), perhaps intended
<div n="lb">as dvandva cpd., {%dirt and water%}; but perhaps same mg.
<div n="lb">as rajomalaṃ in same vs (this word occurs in Pali, e.g.
<div n="lb">Jāt. i.24.23, in different vs) Divy 339.24, {%dirt and impurity%};
<div n="lb">in a list of characteristic practices of ascetics, which are
<div n="lb">said to be ineffective for purifying a man still subject
<div n="lb">to desire; the vs occurs in Pali Dhp. 141, where edd.
<div n="lb">and mss. vary, but Fausböll, 2d ed., rajovajall’; better
<div n="lb">with Mrs. Rhys Davids (Minor Anthologies, 1931) rajo
<div n="lb">va jall’ (cf. jallaṃ Sn 249), two separate words (va prob.
<div n="lb">m.c. for vā); note that Pali repeatedly has rajo-jalla
<div n="lb">(PTSD); it is possible that Mv rajojalaṃ stands for (Pali)
<div n="lb">rajo-jallaṃ, m.c.; jalla is derived in PTSD from Skt.
<div n="lb">*jalya, deriv. of jala (questionable!). The line (in which
<div n="lb">Divy prefixes na, unmetrically, before rajomalaṃ) is
<div n="lb">completed by votkuṭukaprahāṇaṃ (Mv mss. vo utk°;
<div n="lb">Divy notk°; Dhp. ukkuṭikappadhānaṃ).
