{@pariṣkāra@}¦, m. (also {@pariskāra@}; = Pali parikkhāra),
{%equipment, utensils, personal belongings%}: = Tib. yo byad;
Mvy 2856; °ra-vaśitā, one of the 10 vaśitā of a Bodhi-
sattva, Mvy 772; Dharmas 74; °ra-cīvaram Mvy 8945,
presumably the robe as part of (a monk's) {%standard be-%}
{%longings%}; not of a monk but of an ordinary (poor) man,
SP 106.13; often in a standard list, (a monk's) cīvara-
piṇḍapāta-(or °tra-)-śayanāsana-glānapratyayabhaiṣajya-
pariṣkāra (or °skāra; same in MIndic form in Pali, counted
as four items), Mv i.49.10; 52.13; 295.17; Av i.1.7--8;
Divy 143.6, 19; 470.1; Suv 112.9; LV 2.22; Sukh 27.1;
Śikṣ 41.18 (and 215.7 same list without the word pariṣkāra);
Kv 19.9; 20.20; 40.17; 82.13; elsewhere without list,
referring to anything which could properly be given to
a monk, Av i.271.13, 15; six pariṣkāra (of a monk) Av
ii.81.6, MSV ii.123.6, not listed (it is hard to see how the
above list could count up to six; perhaps the ‘eight’
listed PTSD s.v. parikkhāra are meant, the three robes
counting as one item); āgṛhīta-pari°, see {@āgṛhīta@}; doubt-
ful is LV 181.1 pariṣkāra-vigata-malāmātsarya-sunigṛhīta-
citta, where pw renders implausibly ‘etwa {%an sich geübte%}
{%Zucht%}’; Foucaux must have read susaṃgṛhīta-puṇya-
pariṣkāraḥ, as part of the preceding word, assuming mg.
{%parure%} (as in Skt.); Tib. omitted in Foucaux's ed.; sapta-
samādhi-pariṣkāra- (dāyaka, of Buddhas) Divy 95.20,
explained by Pali DN ii.216.31 ff., the seven pari° (comm.
ii.645.28 gloss paricārikā, v.l. parivārikā) are the first
seven stages of the noble 8-fold path, because they lead
progressively to the eighth stage, sammā-(samyak-)
samādhi; the word here seems to mean {%utensils%} in the
sense of {%means leading towards%} (DN l.c. 32 sammāsamā-
dhissa bhāvanāya samādhissa pāripūriyā). In MSV iv.108.1;
109.7 (bheda-)pariṣkāra (tho rendered in Tib. yo byad!)
is false Skt. for Pali (bheda-)purekkhāra.
