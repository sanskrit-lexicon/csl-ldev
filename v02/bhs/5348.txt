{@kṣamaṇīya@}¦, adj. or subst. nt. (= Pali khamanīya,
<div n="lb">Vin. i.59.10, also with yāpanīya), {%tolerable, endurable%}
<div n="lb">(condition): SP 429.4, see s.v. {@yāpanīya@}. Both this form
<div n="lb">and {@kṣemaṇīya(-tara@}, q.v.) are used in what is clearly
<div n="lb">the same locution, bracketed with yāpanīya; kṣam° is
<div n="lb">supported by Pali khamanīya, but {@kṣemaṇīya-pṛccha@},
<div n="lb">q.v., supports kṣem°. Etymologically both forms can be
<div n="lb">justified in a way, but kṣemaṇīya looks strange as a
<div n="lb">derivative of kṣema (premaṇīya is not a perfect parallel)
<div n="lb">and may be a blend of kṣamaṇīya with kṣema. Or is it
<div n="lb">a direct imitation of {@premaṇīya@}, a near-synonym?
