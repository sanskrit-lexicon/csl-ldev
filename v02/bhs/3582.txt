{@udyāma@}¦, m. (cf. Vedic id., the mg. of which in some
<div n="lb">places, ŚB 8.5.1.13, is not clear), in sūtrodyāmaḥ Divy
<div n="lb">643.1 = 644.9, perhaps {%extension, drawing out%} (of thread),
<div n="lb">see s.v. {@tatkṣaṇa@}; but the precise meaning of the phrase
<div n="lb">escapes me. It may mean {%effort, exertion%} (Skt. udyama),
<div n="lb">as in Aśokan u(y)yāma, Rock Ed. (Kalsi) 13.18. In this
<div n="lb">sense probably read nir-udyāmā, as suggested by Kashgar
<div n="lb">rec., SP 100.9 (prose).
