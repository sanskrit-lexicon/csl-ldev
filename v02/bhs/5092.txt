{@? Kūjaka@}¦, n. of a mountain: MSV i.152.12. But Divy
<div n="lb">here {@Kūlaka@}, q.v., and earlier {@Utkūlaka@}, q.v. (for the
<div n="lb">latter MSV i.144.16 is said to read Kulako in ms., ed.
<div n="lb">em. Kūjako); and since the ms. has a lacuna covering
<div n="lb">i.152 (see i.149, note 1), I presume Kūjaka must be based
<div n="lb">on Tib. (sgra can? see i.144, n. 2).
