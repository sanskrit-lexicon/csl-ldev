{@dhyāna@}¦, nt. (Skt. id.; in technical sense = Pali
<div n="lb">jhāna), lit. {%meditation%} or {%contemplation; mystic ‘trance’%};
<div n="lb">Lévi (Sūtrāl.) {%extase%}. Normally {%four%}, as in Pali, described
<div n="lb">in some detail in a long ancient passage (the Pali form,
<div n="lb">virtually identical, cited in Childers), found with hardly
<div n="lb">a true variant LV 129.1--11; 343.14--344.4; Mv i.228.3--10;
<div n="lb">ii.131.16--132.5; Mvy 1478--1481; an abbreviated form,
<div n="lb">giving the central points, as follows: savitarkaṃ savicāraṃ

<div n="lb">72; they are the first four of the nine {@anupūrvavihāra-@}
<div n="lb">{@(-samāpatti)@}, qq.v.; these are related to the four dhyāna-
<div n="lb">bhūmi constituted or occupied by the various classes of
<div n="lb">{@rūpāvacara@} gods (see {@deva@}), as explained by Childers,
<div n="lb">in that attainment in worldly life of (various stages of

<div n="lb">successively higher stages among these gods; catu-dhyāna-

<div n="lb">dhyāna, listed as sadoṣāpakarṣa-, sukhavaihārika-, and
<div n="lb">aśeṣavaibhūṣita- (read {@°vaibhūtika-?@} see this word),
<div n="lb">Dharmas 109; I have found no other trace of this list;
<div n="lb">the names sound vaguely as if the first might apply to
<div n="lb">the first of the 4 dhyāna, the second to the 2d and 3d

<div n="lb">{%meditate on such things as the six dhyāna%}; apparently some

<div n="lb">idea of the specific meaning than had Suzuki (Studies, 414).
