{@etthaṃ@}¦, adv. (= {@ettha@}; not recorded elsewhere;
<div n="lb">only in prose, hence not m.c.; Senart em. first two passages
<div n="lb">to ettha, but keeps etthaṃ iii.316.11; 317.4; 417.6; see
<div n="lb">below), {%here%}: Mv i.24.2; ii.99.3 yattakā ete prāṇā etthaṃ
<div n="lb">yajñe haniṣyanti; repeatedly etthaṃ etaṃ śrūyati, {%here%}
<div n="lb">{%the following is recorded%}, Mv iii.316.11; 317.4; 417.6, and
<div n="lb">one ms. in 416.8 where Senart reads itthaṃ with v.l. and
<div n="lb">with 418.7, where both mss. itthaṃ. The mg. seems to be
<div n="lb">{%here%}, not {%thus%}; but perhaps the form is blended with
<div n="lb">itthaṃ.
