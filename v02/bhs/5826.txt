{@gṛhapati@}¦ (= Pali gahapati), lit. {%householder%}, in °ti-
<div n="lb">ratna, as one of the 7 ‘jewels’ of a cakravartin: LV 14.5;
<div n="lb">Mv i.49.4; 193.17, etc., see the lists s.v. {@ratna@} (3). The
<div n="lb">function of the gṛhapati-ratna is to discern the location
<div n="lb">of hidden treasures by means of the divya-cakṣus which
<div n="lb">he possesses, and bring those of them which are ownerless
<div n="lb">(asvāmika) into the possession of the king: LV 17.17--22;
<div n="lb">substantially the same statement in Pali, DN ii.176.7 ff.
<div n="lb">For this reason, no doubt, PTSD s.v. ratna translates
<div n="lb">gahapati by {%treasurer%}; but there is no clear evidence that
<div n="lb">he had precisely the functions which we should associate
<div n="lb">with that title. In Pali a gahapati (see PTSD s.v.) is, to
<div n="lb">be sure, often associated with seṭṭhi = śreṣṭhin; the Pali
<div n="lb">word is often rendered {%treasurer%}, but perhaps {%capitalist%}
<div n="lb">would be better (orig. {%guild-leader%}).
