{@karpāsa-picu@}¦ (m.; = Pali kappāsa-picu; cpd. not
<div n="lb">noted in Skt., where picu is masc.), {%cotton%} (in some form),
<div n="lb">used as symbol of lightness: Divy 210.15; 388.15, along
<div n="lb">with {@tūlapicu@}, q.v.; both together in Pali in the same
<div n="lb">way SN v.284.1; there evidently was some difference
<div n="lb">between the two, but what?
