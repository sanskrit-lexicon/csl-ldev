{@evarūpa@}¦, adj. (= Pali id.; Skt. evaṃrūpa), {%of such%}
<div n="lb">{%a sort%} or {%form%}: very common in vss, SP 83.14; 86.14;
<div n="lb">93.4; 94.1; 95.4, 12; 96.8; 97.6; LV 55.9; Dbh.g. 12(348).16;
[Page157-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">Sukh 50.12; but also in prose, esp. of Mv, e.g. i.39.8;
<div n="lb">329.7, 21; 330.11; ii.257.12; iii.317.7; 444.6, etc.; also in
<div n="lb">prose of LV, 13.22 and 307.13 (so all Lefm.'s mss. and
<div n="lb">Weller's ms., certainly not misprint as suggested by Weller
<div n="lb">16), as well as 441.12, eṣām evarūpāṇāṃ dharmāṇāṃ
<div n="lb">(no v.l. except Calc. evaṃrū°, cited by Lefm., so that
<div n="lb">evarū° is not a misprint; not noted by Weller). Pali also
<div n="lb">uses evarūpa in prose as well as verse. (PTSD cites this
<div n="lb">cpd. under eva; of course it should be under evaṃ.) Cf.
<div n="lb">{@keva-rūpa@}.
