{@baddhamālā@}¦, {%having a garland bound on%}, n. of the
<div n="lb">2d bodhisattva-bhūmi; so read for ed. °mānā Mv i.76.14.
<div n="lb">It is inconceivable that such a name as the mss. present
<div n="lb">should be applied to a bhūmi; and my em. is supported
<div n="lb">in sense by puṣpamaṇḍitā, n. of the 3d bhūmi immediately
<div n="lb">following. This word cannot, therefore, be cited (with
<div n="lb">Renou, Etudes de gram. scte., 1936, p.18) as an example
<div n="lb">of -māna added to a ppp. (§ 34.1).
