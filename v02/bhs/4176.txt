{@okkarika@}¦, m. (= {@aukarika@}, q.v.; acc. to Feer,
<div n="lb">Transl. of Av, = Tib. yul tsoṅ [read tshoṅ] pa, see below),
<div n="lb">some kind of tradesman; Feer, ‘country merchant’; but
<div n="lb">yul, which indeed often means janapada (opp. to {%town%}),
<div n="lb">in comp. with tshoṅ pa, {%merchant%}, could possibly mean
<div n="lb">{%dealer in agricultural products%}, something like {%truck-farmer%};
<div n="lb">possibly cf. ogara, oggara, cited by Sheth from Prākṛta-
<div n="lb">piṅgala as meaning {%a king of grain%} or {%rice%}. Certainly not
<div n="lb">a keeper of a shop in the country, for the story shows that
<div n="lb">it means a member of an urban tradesman's guild, parallel
<div n="lb">with perfumers: Av i.198.7 pitā te okkarika āsīd; 10
[Page158-1b+ 43]
<div n="lb">tenaukkarikāpaṇo vyavasthāpitaḥ; 12 tenaukkarika-tvaṃ
<div n="lb">tyaktvā. The story is the same as that in which Divy uses
<div n="lb">{@aukarika@}. I see no reason to associate with either of these
<div n="lb">words the n. pr. {@Utkarika@} or {@Otk°@}, qq.v.
