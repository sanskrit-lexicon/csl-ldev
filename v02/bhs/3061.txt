{@āśvāsa-praśvāsa@}¦ (Pali assāsa-passāsa), m. dual or
<div n="lb">pl., {%breath%}; usually used without clear indication of dif-
<div n="lb">ference between the two terms, like {@ānāpāna@}, q.v.: LV
<div n="lb">251.15--16 nāsikātaś cāśvāsapraśvāsāv uparuddhāv abhū-
<div n="lb">tāṃ; 252.3 °sā ūrdhvaṃ śiraḥkapālam upanighnanti sma;
<div n="lb">as separate words, 259.7 āśvāsaviprahīnaḥ praśvāsa-
<div n="lb">varjitu; Mv ii.124.10 (and ff.) mukhato nāsikāśrotrehi ca
<div n="lb">āśvāsapraśvāsā uparundhi (1 sg. aor.); Mv iii.179.19 °sehi

<div n="lb">sakṛtyaṃ; Sādh 61.19 °sādikam; the verb {@uśvasati@}, q.v.,
[Page110-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">corresponds to āśvāsa in Mv ii.208.3--4 āśvāsapraśvāsā
<div n="lb">uparuddhā…no pi uśvasati na praśvasati (the two verbs
<div n="lb">repeated twice in lines 8, 9), cf. LV 189.12 ucchvasantaṃ
<div n="lb">praśvasantam, rendered by Tib. dbugs dbyuṅ zhiṅ rṅub
<div n="lb">{%breathing out and in%}, but in line 15 below praśvasantaḥ
<div n="lb">is rendered dbugs dbyuṅ, {%breathing out%} (implying that
<div n="lb">ucchvasantaṃ was understood as {%breathing in%}); {@ucchvāsa-@}
<div n="lb">{@praśvāso@} (sg.) also occurs, seemingly = āśvāsa-pra°,
<div n="lb">Śikṣ 42.5; in Sādh 146.17 ff. it is entirely certain that
<div n="lb">praśvāsa is understood as {%outbreathing%} and āśvāsa {%inbreath-%}
<div n="lb">{%ing%}, tadanu tan mithunaṃ praśvāsavāyurathārūḍhaṃ
<div n="lb">nāsikāvivareṇa niḥsṛtya…sattvānāṃ kāyavākcittāni vi-
<div n="lb">śodhya gṛhītvā ca punar āśvāsavāyum āruhya tenaiva
<div n="lb">pathā svahṛtkamalakarṇikāyāṃ praviśet; consistent with
<div n="lb">this is AMg. ussāsa (and relatives), which BHS usage
<div n="lb">would clearly have associated with āśvāsa, and which acc.
<div n="lb">to Ratnach. means {%breathing in%}; Pali tradition is indeter-
<div n="lb">minate, see Vism i.272.1 which states that Vin. comm.
<div n="lb">defines assāsa as {%outgoing%}, passāsa as {%incoming%} breath, but
<div n="lb">that in Sutta comms. (Suttantaṭṭhakathāsu) the reverse
<div n="lb">is taught (the passage is misunderstood by PTSD and
<div n="lb">Pe Maung Tin; uppaṭipāṭiyā = Pkt. upparivāḍi, {%inverted,%}
<div n="lb">{%transposed%}). Tib. regularly āśvasati = dbugs brṅubs (or
<div n="lb">cognate) {%breathe in%} Mvy 1173, 1175, etc., praśvasati =
<div n="lb">dbugs phyuṅ (or cognate) {%breathe out%} Mvy 1174, 1176,
<div n="lb">etc.; it therefore supports Sādh 146.17 ff., and incidentally
<div n="lb">the equation of āśvāsa with āna and praśvāsa with apāna
<div n="lb">(see {@ānāpāna@}). How old this interpretation is remains
<div n="lb">uncertain, esp. in view of the fact that in Pali the comms.
<div n="lb">differed; Buddhaghosa himself, in the Vism. passage cited,
<div n="lb">declines to arbitrate between the two opposing views.
<div n="lb">Whatever may have been the meaning of the two terms,
<div n="lb">it seems clear that the cpd. (like {@ānāpāna@}) was commonly
<div n="lb">used in the sense of {%breath%}, collectively and as a whole.
