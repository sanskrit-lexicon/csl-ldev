{@apahṛta-bhāra@}¦, adj. (= Pali ohita-bh°; so also in
<div n="lb">BHS, see s.v., but not in the passages cited PTSD s.v.
<div n="lb">ohita, which quotes LV apahṛta as apahita; Pali also
<div n="lb">panna-bh°), {%having laid aside one's burden(s)%}, in Pali said
<div n="lb">of arahats, and so of arhants in BHS, SP 1.7; also of Buddha,
<div n="lb">LV 425.20; of śrāvakas, Mvy 1084 (and ohita° of Bodhi-
<div n="lb">sattvas). Probably {@ohita-@} in this cpd. in Pali (and in
<div n="lb">BHS) historically represents apahṛta, {%removed%} (so Tib. on
<div n="lb">Mvy khur bor ba, {%having laid off the burden%}); ava-dhā
<div n="lb">does not have this mg. in either Skt. or Pali, and apa-
<div n="lb">dhā is exclusively Rigvedic and rare even there.
