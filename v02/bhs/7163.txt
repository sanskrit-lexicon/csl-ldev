{@tvagbhāra@}¦ (m.), part of a tree, some part of the bark
<div n="lb">or a kind of bark: °ra-taś ca Divy 628.1, see s.v. {@phalgu 1@}.
<div n="lb">One is tempted to em. to tvaksāra- (Pali tacasāra); the
<div n="lb">fact that sārataḥ follows is no objection, since it means
<div n="lb">{%as to the pith%}; but unless the mss. actually read tvak-,
<div n="lb">the misreading implied is not easy to assume.
