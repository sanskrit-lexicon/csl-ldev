{@? Samīkṣitavadana@}¦ (em.), n. of a former Buddha:
<div n="lb">Mv i.139.10. The mss. read Samīkṣitaḥ as one name,
<div n="lb">followed by Vadanasatyaṇḍatāraḥ; Senart em. °ta-vadanaḥ,
<div n="lb">and then {@Satyāvatāraḥ@}, which seems rather remote from
<div n="lb">the mss., but no good substitute occurs to me.
