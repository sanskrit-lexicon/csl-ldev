1 {@bodha@}¦, m. (? = bodhi, normally f. in BHS as in
<div n="lb">Pali; but Pali records also bodha, m., and Skt. bodha is
<div n="lb">used not very differently), {@(1) = bodhi@}, {%enlightenment%},
<div n="lb">in the technical Buddhist sense; so far as noted, seems
<div n="lb">limited in BHS to the forms bodhāya and (rarely, prob.
<div n="lb">only in Mv) bodhāye, which are usually interpretable as
<div n="lb">datives: bodhāye Mv i.47.16; 60.11 (so mss. indicate);
<div n="lb">ii.130.18 (in prec. line bodhāya, but v.l. °ye, in same phrase);
<div n="lb">Senart, whose note i.369 on i.3.2 discusses both the forms,
<div n="lb">calls bodhāye fem., but such datives are recorded from
<div n="lb">indisputably m.-nt. stems, § 8.45; more tempting to the
<div n="lb">fem. interpretation is the occasional, tho rare, occurrence
<div n="lb">of bodhāya (in vss) where dat. syntax seems hard to
<div n="lb">accept; so gen., to sarvi bodhāya (mss.) abhūṣi lābhinaḥ
<div n="lb">SP 49.14 (vs), repeated often in the sequel, as 50.2 etc.;
<div n="lb">in 50.12 and 51.4 bodhāya is confirmed by citations Śikṣ
<div n="lb">92.13; 93.5; bodhāya…varṇam SP 10.6 (vs) = 12.16;
<div n="lb">loc., bodhāya sthāpitāḥ SP 306.3 (vs); it is possible that
<div n="lb">the fem. gender of bodhi (in Pali and BHS) has led to some
<div n="lb">forms suggesting a stem bodhā (oblique °āya, °āye), but
<div n="lb">bodhāya is usually dat., and occurs often in prose; KN
<div n="lb">ed. of SP often keeps it but as often emends to bodhīya,
<div n="lb">with utter inconsistency; dat. occurrences of bodhāya,
<div n="lb">SP (in mss.) 14.2; 33.1; 46.10; 47.13; 303.12; 334.11; LV
<div n="lb">209.9 (prose); 284.8; Mv i.46.1; 63.2, 11; 97.2; 234.5;
<div n="lb">ii.130.13, 17; Suv 42.6; Śikṣ 5.18; KP 20.9; Gv 105.15
<div n="lb">(prose); Bbh 13.19 (prose), etc.; ({@2@}) n. of a householder:
<div n="lb">Divy 167.2 ff.; he lived in Śiśumāragiri; cf. Pali Bodhi
<div n="lb">(DPPN), a prince whose capital was Suṃsumāragiri; but
<div n="lb">the two stories seem quite unrelated otherwise.
