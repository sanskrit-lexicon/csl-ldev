{@elapatra@}¦, m., ({@1@}) one of four ‘great treasures’ (ma-
<div n="lb">hānidhi; cf. a similar group of four treasures in Pali,
<div n="lb">DN comm. i.284.8, saṅkha, ela, uppala, puṇḍarīka), each
<div n="lb">presided over by a nāga-king of (presumably) the same
<div n="lb">name (so definitely stated for Elapatra): Mv iii.383.18--
<div n="lb">384.1 catvāro mahānidhayo saṃkho vārāṇasyāṃ mithilā-
<div n="lb">yāṃ (19) padumo kaliṃgeṣu piṃgalo takṣaśilāyāṃ ela-
<div n="lb">patro; vārāṇasyāṃ saṃkhasya māsiko (20) samājo vartati;
<div n="lb">tahiṃ nidhānādhipatayo nāgarājāno nimantritakā āgatā;
<div n="lb">(384.1) tatra ca elapatreṇa nāgarājñā praśnā sthāpitā
<div n="lb">(see below for Pali equivalent); ({@2@}) Elapatra, in Mv iii.384.1,
<div n="lb">above, n. of a nāga-king presiding over the ‘treasure’ of
<div n="lb">the same name; presumably the same as the nāga (or
<div n="lb">nāga-king) named (without reference to the ‘treasure’)
<div n="lb">Mvy 3271 (Kyoto ed. Elāpattra, by error; Mironov Ela°
<div n="lb">with no v.l.); Suv 162.9; Mmk 452.20; Kv 2.9; Māy 222.3;
<div n="lb">247.2; certainly the same as the Elapatra (mss.; ed. wrongly
<div n="lb">em. Elā°) of Divy 61.4, tho here he is not called a nāga
<div n="lb">but one of the four ‘kings’ presiding over the four treasures
<div n="lb">(cf. Mv iii.383.18 ff. above), (Divy 61.1) atha catvāro
<div n="lb">mahārājāś caturmahānidhisthāḥ, (3--4, vs) Piṅgalaś ca
<div n="lb">Kaliṅgeṣu Mithilāyāṃ ca Pāṇḍukaḥ, Elapatraś ca Gān-
<div n="lb">dhāre Śaṅkho Vārāṇasīpure. Besides the Pali parallel, DN
<div n="lb">comm. above, cf. the 9 treasures of Kubera which include
<div n="lb">Śaṅkha and Padma (with presiding personages of the same
<div n="lb">names), and among the Jains the 9 treasures of a cakra-
<div n="lb">vartin, which in their AMg. forms include piṃgala, paṇḍua
<div n="lb">(= pāṇḍuka), and saṃkha; the Skt. forms of these are
<div n="lb">recorded at least lexically. Note also in Pali the nāga-
<div n="lb">king Erakapatta, of Dhp. comm. iii.231 ff., who however
<div n="lb">does not seem to be brought into relation to the ‘treasure’
<div n="lb">called in Pali ela (above); but the vss attributed to him,
<div n="lb">and the replies to them, in Dhp. comm. are reproduced
<div n="lb">in Mv iii.384, see above.
