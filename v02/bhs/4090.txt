{@ekoti-(°tī-)bhāva@}¦, m. (= Pali ekodi°, app. not
recorded with ī, which is commoner in BHS tho both are
written; etym. and lit. mg. much disputed, see refs. in
Lévi Sūtrāl. xiv.14n., Renou JA 1939 p. 393 note 1,
referring esp. to ŚB 12.2.2.4 prāṇā nānā santa ekotayaḥ
samānam (so, not °nām!) ūtim anusaṃcaranti; here ūti
surely means {%web%}, and it is hard to believe with Eggeling's
transl. (note) that the second part of the cpd. ekoti could
mean anything else; cf. the next two items), {%the becoming%}
{%concentrated, concentration%} (of mind, cetasaḥ; seems to mean
about the same as Skt. ekāgratā manasaḥ); chiefly in
formulaic statement of process leading out of the first
dhyāna into the second, found (with slight variants) Mvy
1479; LV 129.3; 343.17; Mv i.228.5; ii.131.18; 283.8;
iii.213.9 (here, by a strange confusion of formulas, applies
to entrance into first dhyāna); Dbh 34.2: sa vitarkavi-
cārāṇāṃ (var., taking sa as associative prefix, savitar-
kāṇāṃ savicārāṇāṃ, or the like) vyupaśamād adhyātma-
saṃprasādāc cetasa ekotibhāvād (once °vā; ekotī° Mvy;
Mv i.228.5; iii.213.9; Dbh; and vv.ll. LV 343.17; Mv
ii.131.18) avitarkam avicāraṃ samādhijaṃ prītisukhaṃ
dvitīyaṃ (Mv iii.213.9 prathamaṃ) dhyānam upasaṃpadya
viharati (or other form of this verb); this passage is prose
and the var. in quantity cannot be m.c.; other occur-
rences, Mvy 1656 ekotībhāvaḥ; Gv 490.15 (prose) sa
ekotībhāvagataḥ sarvabuddhadharmeṣu; Gv 305.7 (prose)
ekotībhāvagataṃ dharmadhātum avatarāmi.
