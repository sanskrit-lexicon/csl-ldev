{@ayava@}¦, m. or nt., a high number, Mvy 7774 (m.; so
<div n="lb">also Mironov); Gv 133.24 (nt.), cited in Mvy 7903 apparently
<div n="lb">in mss. as apavaḥ, but Kyoto ed. in paren. adds (as em.?)
<div n="lb">ayavam, and Tib. rendering is clearly meant to be identical
<div n="lb">with that for ayava 7774. Altho Mironov reads apavaḥ
<div n="lb">without v.l. in 7903, further confirmation of stem ayava
<div n="lb">is prob. furnished by Gv 106.13 where for text sattvajava-
<div n="lb">sya we should doubtless understand sattvāj°, that is
<div n="lb">ajava = ayava (or even read sattvāyavasya?).
