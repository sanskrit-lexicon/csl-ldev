ally: f., mahāvyūhāya (loc.) sthitaḥ samādhiye (loc.) LV
60.4 (vs; in prec. prose mahāvyūhasya samādher 59.20-21);

Mv iii.409.12; nt., tāni samādhīni Kv 51.7--8 (prose;
line 2 above ete samādhayaḥ). As 8th step in the 8-fold
[Page569-a+ 71]
Path, samyak-sa°, see {@mārga@}. Sa° is 5-fold, ārya-pañcāṅ-
gika-samādhi-saṃpannā(ḥ) Mv ii.292.9, of bodhisattvas;
acc. to a Pali list (Childers s.v.) the 5 aṅga are pīti-phara-
ṇatā, sukha-phar°, ceto-phar°, āloka-phar°, and pacca-
vekkhanānimittaṃ; see also s.v. {@pañcāṅgika@} (2). Four
kinds of sa° Mvy 967--970: chanda-, citta-, vīrya-, mīmāṃ-
sā-sa° (= Pali cha°, ci°, viriya-, vīmaṃsā-); another list
of four kinds Dharmas 101, somewhat corrupt, cf. the
adhimukticaryābhūmi-nāmāni Mvy 896--901, and Sūtrāl.
xiv.24--26 with comm.; acc. to Dharmas āloka- (Mvy 898
°ka-labdha, read °lābha, Lévi on Sūtrāl.), vṛtāloka- (read
vṛddhā°, cf. Mvy 899 āloka-vṛddhiḥ), ekādaśa-(read
ekadeśa-)-pratiṣṭha- (cf. Mvy 900 tattvārthaikadeśānu-
praveśaḥ), and ānantarya-sa° (= Mvy 901, misprinted
an°). There are a number of lists, some of them very long,
of particular samādhis; over 100 in Mvy 505--623, from
‘Prajñāpāramitā’, e.g. ŚsP 1412.8 ff. (these are all included
in this Dict.); a very different list AsP 490.8--492.6; nearly
70 (practised by Avalokiteśvara) Kv 51.9 ff.; list of 17,
Kv 77.8 ff.; of 37, Kv 92.17 ff.; only four, {@Śūraṃgama@}
(which occurs frequently), {@Gagaṇagañja, Vimalaprabha@},
and {@Siṃhavikrīḍita@}, Dharmas 136; 100 Bodhisattva-sa°
Gv 36.22 ff. (this term occurs elsewhere in Gv and other
works, e.g. Dbh 2.27, of named samādhis practised by
Bodhisattvas). Few of the names in these and other lists
recur, and most of them are not separately listed in this
Dict.; they seem mostly to be ad hoc inventions of the
respective authors. For samādhi in relation to {@samāpatti@}
see the latter.
