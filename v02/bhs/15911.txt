{@Samantaprabhāsa@}¦, reading of SP edd. in most
<div n="lb">occurrences for n. of a future Buddha, which it is predicted
<div n="lb">that Ājñāta Kauṇḍinya will become, SP 206.11, and
<div n="lb">also n. of 500 future Buddhas which 500 ‘great disciples’
<div n="lb">will become, 207.2. But the true reading in both places
<div n="lb">is prob. {@Samantaprabha@} (1), with Kashgar rec. In the
<div n="lb">same account, °prabha is read without v.l. in 207.9 and
<div n="lb">208.10, guaranteed by meter; in 208.5 text reads prabhā-
<div n="lb">sanāmasya (referring to the former case), but Kashgar
<div n="lb">rec. Samantaprabha-; in 209.4 text Samantaprabhāsasya,
<div n="lb">metr. very bad, Kashgar rec. and one Nep. ms. °prabhasya,
<div n="lb">better metrically (°prābhasya is required).
