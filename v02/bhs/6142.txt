{@cari@}¦, or {@carī@} (ī chiefly or wholly m.c.), f. (not recorded
<div n="lb">in MIndic; = Skt. {@caryā@}, Pali {@cariyā@}, both also in BHS,
<div n="lb">see s.vv.; cf. § 3.115), {%course of conduct, regular system of%}
<div n="lb">{%action%} (esp. {%religious%}); particularly with reference to the
<div n="lb">{%programmatic course%} of a Bodhisattva, leading to enlighten-
<div n="lb">ment; (on its four aspects or stages see s.v. {@caryā@};) these
<div n="lb">forms chiefly, but not exclusively, in verse; see also
<div n="lb">{@cāri, cārikā@}; in prose the usual expression is (Bodhi-
<div n="lb">sattva-)caryā, e.g. SP 7.1; 65.5; LV 90.10; Gv 58.9; but
<div n="lb">even in prose note (bo) dhisattva-cari-niṣpanda- LV 5.1
<div n="lb">(all mss., only Calc. °carita°), and cf. Bhadracari-vidhi-
<div n="lb">pūrvakaṃ Śikṣ 139.13 (prose; the bhadra-cari is the
<div n="lb">bodhisattva-cari; the work of this name is elsewhere
<div n="lb">called Bhadra-caryā in the prose of Śikṣ, 290.8; 291.9;
<div n="lb">297.1); in Bhad itself the form is Bhadracari wherever
<div n="lb">meter does not require ī, as in the cpd. °cari-praṇidhāna 2,
<div n="lb">49, 54, 61, where in the seam of the cpd. the consonant
<div n="lb">cluster makes the preceding syllable long; cf. also the acc.

<div n="lb">wrongly regards the title as primarily °carī. (All remaining
<div n="lb">citations in this article are from verses.) caryā may be
<div n="lb">used even in vss, where meter is indifferent (so SP 67.13)
<div n="lb">or requires long first syllable (SP 68.6), tho in the latter
<div n="lb">case {@cāri (°ī)@} and {@cārikā@}, qq.v., are also found; nearly
<div n="lb">all the cases here cited refer to the {%religious course%} leading
<div n="lb">to enlightenment, to Buddhahood or Bodhisattvahood,
<div n="lb">but occasionally the term is applied to any or all human
<div n="lb">courses of action, including such as are disapproved; iya
