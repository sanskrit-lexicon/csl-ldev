{@kalpika-śālā@}¦, also {@°ka-sthāna@}, corresp. to Pali
<div n="lb">kappiya-kuṭī (also -bhūmi), which is variously rendered
<div n="lb">(in SBE 13.304, on Vin. i.139.36, {%kitchen%}), in MSV i.235.2.
[Page173-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">4 (°śālā), 8 ff. (°sthāna), introduced as a place where
<div n="lb">broth for a sick monk could be heated, and seems to
<div n="lb">mean lit. either {%hall (place) for allowable (proper) perqui-%}
<div n="lb">{%sites%} (see prec.), or possibly {%hall (place) for preparation%} of
<div n="lb">such perquisites (?); five are listed (cf. the somewhat
<div n="lb">diff. list of four in Pali Vin. i.240.1 ff.), ārabhyamāṇāntikā
<div n="lb">(sc. śālā; {%whose boundaries%}, anta, {%are being proposed%}),
<div n="lb">ucchrīyamāṇāntikā, {@goniṣādikā, udbhūtavastukā, saṃ-@}
<div n="lb">{@matikā@}; all are ‘explained’ in 6 ff., but the glosses are
<div n="lb">not all very clear. In i.234.4 kalpika-sthāna refers to a
<div n="lb">proper place for preparing (perhaps also storing? see
<div n="lb">{@pratijāgarti@}) food, and ten akalpikāni (sthānāni) are
<div n="lb">listed 5 ff.
