{@aparādhyati@}¦ (cf. AMg. avarajjhati (2), {%to be destroyed,%}
<div n="lb">{%to be ruined%}, Ratnach., naṣṭa honā, Sheth; naśyati often
<div n="lb">means {%disappear!%}), {%disappears%}: Mv ii.137.9 (śakuntā…)
<div n="lb">aparādhyetsuḥ, aor.; so mss., Senart em. apavidhyinsuḥ, but
<div n="lb">this could only mean {%were thrown away%}, which is completely
<div n="lb">inappropriate; in Mv ii.139.4, in identical context, mss.
<div n="lb">aparijhiṃsuḥ (°nsuḥ), Senart em. °vijhinsuḥ; read perhaps
<div n="lb">MIndic aparajjhiṃsuḥ, cf. AMg. above; in any case some
