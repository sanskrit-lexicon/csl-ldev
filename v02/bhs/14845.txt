{@śamya@}¦, or (in LV always written) {@sa°@} (= Pali samma,
here m.; for Skt. see below), a kind of cymbal, always
in LV and often in Pali in cpd. with {@tāḍa@} (tāḷa), which
usually follows but in LV 301.16 precedes this (PTSD
wrongly makes sammatāḷa the n. of a single instrument;
Pali comms., e.g. Jāt. vi.61.7--8, make it a dvandva,
and samma occurs alone in Pali); Skt. has only śamyā-
(-tāla, e.g. Mbh. Cr. ed. 2.4.31), which is known in BHS
only in Mvy 5018; in Skt. often and in LV always, acc.
to Lefm., written with p for y, but (cf. pw 6.208) Pali
proves that y is right, p a graphic corruption; prob.
identical with Skt. śamyā, {%wedge%}, from the shape of the
instrument; the m. (or ṇt.) stem in -a is not recorded
in Skt. but is the only one recorded in Pali as n. of a mus.
instrument, and so (except for Mvy) in BHS; in LV only
stem-form recorded in long dvandva cpds. of names of
mus. instruments: LV 40.20; 163.6 (here Calc. samya);
206.14; 212.4 (here °tāḍāvacara-); -tāḍa-sampādīṃś ca
(no v.l.) 301.16.
