{@? āsaya@}¦, nt., in Mv iii.400.3 hitvā ālayāni (see {@ālaya@})
<div n="lb">āsayāni (v.l. āsanāni); the Pali parallel Sn 535 reads
<div n="lb">āsavāni = BHS āśravāṇi, ās°, which must probably be
<div n="lb">read, since {@āśaya@} (q.v.) seems not to be used in a pejorative
<div n="lb">sense, and no other interpretation for āsaya seems possible.
