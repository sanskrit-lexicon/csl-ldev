{@? prativrata@}¦, f. {@°ā@}, adj., {%true to vows%} (of chastity):
<div n="lb">°tānāṃ Mv iii.151.5, 7, applied to female ascetics (tāpasī-
<div n="lb">nāṃ 5); v.l. both times pati°, which could not apply here
<div n="lb">in its normal mg. {%true to one's husband%} (so also Pali pati-
<div n="lb">bbatā); AMg. paivvayā is glossed prativratā, and rendered
<div n="lb">thus in both Guj. and Hindi, yet the Skt. gloss is patiṃ
<div n="lb">vratayati (Ratnach.); for Skt. prati AMg. usually has paḍi,
<div n="lb">rarely pai.For Mvy 7261 pativratā a v.l. prati° is recorded;
<div n="lb">but there is no such v.l. in Mironov, and Tib. says clearly
<div n="lb">{%not unfaithful to her husband%}. Possibly MIndic forms of
<div n="lb">Skt. pativratā came to mean simply {%chaste%}, and then
[Page369-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">became applicable even to female ascetics; the form prati°
<div n="lb">might then be an unhistorical hyper-Sktism.
