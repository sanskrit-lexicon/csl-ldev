{@? parisaṃsthita@}¦ (ppp. of pari-saṃ-sthā, of which

<div n="lb">sthitā SP 244.12 (prose; ed. fails to separate from the
<div n="lb">prec. word). But perhaps the caus. parisaṃsthāpitā (see
<div n="lb">prec.) should be read with WT; no ms. is reported with
<div n="lb">it but some mss. have caus. forms, and the parallel 246.7
<div n="lb">looks in this direction.
