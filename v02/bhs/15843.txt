{@sama-tīrthika@}¦, f. {@°ikā@}, adj. (var. °thaka, °tittika;
<div n="lb">Pali °titthika, var. °tittika, see below), {%full to the brim%};
<div n="lb">in both Pali and BHS used ({@1@}) of rivers in flood (so most
<div n="lb">commonly in Pali, e.g. DN i.244.14, where text °tittikā,

<div n="lb">true reading and interpretation; for others see PTSD s.v.
<div n="lb">The variant °tittika, tho found in both Pali and Mvy
<div n="lb">tradition, is prob. a corruption. The mg. of tīrtha here
<div n="lb">implied is an extension of Skt. usage, where it is used of
<div n="lb">what are now called {%bathing ghats%} in India; from this to
<div n="lb">{%edge, bank%}, of a river, was a short step; the cpd. sama-
<div n="lb">tīrthika was prob. used first of very full rivers, then by
<div n="lb">extension of food-bowls.
