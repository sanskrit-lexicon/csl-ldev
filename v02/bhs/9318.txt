{@? palīkṛta@}¦, in Av ii.136.10 (vs) ādīptaṃ kānanaṃ
<div n="lb">sarvaṃ parvatā pi °kṛtā, perh. {%even the mountains are made%}
<div n="lb">{%into straws%} (pala, Skt. Lex., {%straw%}). Speyer, {%a-glowing%}, with
<div n="lb">little if any support, and evidently thinking the word
<div n="lb">must have a mg. similar to ādīptaṃ; but this is quite
<div n="lb">unnecessary; two entirely separate situations are referred
<div n="lb">to, related only in that they are things hard to conceive
<div n="lb">as accomplished. Speyer cites Tib. as ser bo, which he
<div n="lb">identifies with ser po, {%yellow%}; this, even if justified, does
<div n="lb">not give the meaning he assumes.
