{@tāyin@}¦, m. (= AMg. tāi, defined as {%attaining salvation%},
<div n="lb">i.e. {%holy, religious%}; also {%who protects himself and others%},
<div n="lb">i.e. a Jina; Pali tādi, see below), originally Prakritic for
<div n="lb">Pali tādi(n) = Skt. tādṛś; see {@tādṛ(n), tādṛśa(ka)@}. The
<div n="lb">identity of the two words can hardly be questioned. The
[Page252-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">mg. of Pali tādi(n) is also quite clear, {%such%} (= tādṛś);
<div n="lb">doubt remains only as to whether this meant originally
<div n="lb">{%such as the Buddha%}, of the same quality as He, or {%such%}
<div n="lb">{%as a religious man ought to be%}, thus {%holy, following the path%}
<div n="lb">{%of true religion%}. On the Pali see esp. Childers s.v., also
<div n="lb">Senart on Mv ii.256.9, where BHS uses evaṃrūpa in
<div n="lb">nearly the same sense; Senart points out that tathārūpa
<div n="lb">glosses tādi in Dhp. comm. Acc. to Childers tādi is usually
<div n="lb">applied to {%holy men%}, only rarely to Buddha. In BHS tāyin
<div n="lb">most often applies to Buddhas, but also fairly often to
<div n="lb">Bodhisattvas, and occasionally to other holy men. Once,
<div n="lb">at least, {@tādṛśaka@}, q.v., is clearly applied to a Buddha,
<div n="lb">like tāyin. These facts all together make it seem clear
<div n="lb">to me that the etym. and original mg. are as stated above.
<div n="lb">It is true that Tib. (see on Mvy below) interprets tāyin
<div n="lb">as if for trāyin, rendering {%protector%} or the like; some modern
<div n="lb">scholars (Burnouf, Lotus 16, on vs 73 of Chap. 1; pw
<div n="lb">7.345 ‘wohl nur fehlerhaft für trāyin’) assume that this
<div n="lb">was the etym. and primary mg. of tāyin. But against this
<div n="lb">stands not only Pali but BHS {@tādṛśa(ka), tādṛ(n)-@}. Tib.
<div n="lb">doubtless has a secondary popular etymology. The forms
<div n="lb">are typical of in-stems: tāyī n. sg. (SP 45.13; Mvy 15,
<div n="lb">1746), tāyinaḥ gen. sg. (SP 69.2; 208.7, etc.), °nām gen.
<div n="lb">pl. (SP 176.8 etc.), tāyibhiḥ (LV 388.13), etc. Occasionally
<div n="lb">the mss. write corruptly tāpin (so Mv ii.349.12 text, prob.
<div n="lb">mere misprint; Mmk 98.8; 499.19; 599.20; 600.17).
<div n="lb">({@1@}) Used of others than Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, {%holy%}:
<div n="lb">anigho tāyi tam āhu śrotriyaṃ ti Mv iii.400.2; ariyo (mss.,
<div n="lb">Senart āryo) tāyi pravuccati tathatvā 400.6; in iii.397.2
<div n="lb">read, śramaṇo tāyi (mss. bhāvayi, Senart tādi, cf. 400.6)
<div n="lb">pravuccati tathatvā, {%he is called in truth a monk, a holy man%}

<div n="lb">{%(will get) rid of all misery (states of being)%}; ({@2@}) used of
<div n="lb">Bodhisattvas (other than Śākyamuni in his last existence,

<div n="lb">is cited alone) are verses; they are not exhaustive, but it
<div n="lb">is doubtful whether tāyin occurs anywhere in prose.
