{@tathādarśana@}¦, adj. Bhvr. (evidently = {@evaṃdar-@}
<div n="lb">{@śana, °dṛṣṭi@}), {%holding such a view%}: Mv ii.120.17 (sa) cāhaṃ
<div n="lb">bhikṣavo tathādarśanato evaṃ va (one ms. omits va)

<div n="lb">samāno yena gayānagaraṃ tad avasāri, {%and, O monks%}
<div n="lb">(realizing the worthlessness of the doctrine of Rāma,
<div n="lb">taught by his son), {%from the holder of such a doctrine%} (viz.
<div n="lb">from Udraka Rāmaputra), {%being just as I was, I went off%}
<div n="lb">{%to Gayā-city%}; in ii.119.6 we should expect a close parallel,
<div n="lb">in which the Bodhisattva leaves Ārāḍa Kālāma, but the
<div n="lb">text seems corrupt: sa khalv ahaṃ bhikṣavo tathādar-
<div n="lb">śanāya (so, or °nāyai, mss.; Senart em. °nāyaiva; required
<div n="lb">is rather °nato, prob. followed by evaṃ va) samāno, etc.
<div n="lb">(he goes to Rājagṛha). (Otherwise Senart; ignoring the
<div n="lb">Bhvr. nature of the cpd. which seems guaranteed by
<div n="lb">evaṃdarśana, °dṛṣṭi.) Also Mv ii.123.16 (prose) sa khalv
<div n="lb">ahaṃ…tathādarśanasamāno, {%I being of this opinion%} (as
<div n="lb">just stated in prec.).
