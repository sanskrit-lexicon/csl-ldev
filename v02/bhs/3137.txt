{@itthatva@}¦, nt. (= Pali itthatta), {%the being in this world%}:
<div n="lb">Mv iii.447.8 (kṣīṇā me jātir…) noparim itthatvam iti
<div n="lb">prajānāti.Recorded as icchatva Mv i.52.7 devanikāyato
<div n="lb">cyavitvā icchatvam āgacchanti, and in similar phrases
<div n="lb">52.8; 338.18; ii.133.4. Senart allows icchatva to stand,
<div n="lb">regarding it as a genuine phonetic alternative form (i.417);
<div n="lb">and all mss. read so in these passages. But in view of
<div n="lb">iii.447.8 it seems to me likely that icchatva is a mere
<div n="lb">graphic corruption, § 2.22. See however {@icchatva@}.
