{@tulya@}¦, adj., used in a peculiar sense in SP, and as
<div n="lb">I think misunderstood by Burnouf and Kern: {%equal%} in
<div n="lb">the sense of {%equally available, open to choice%} (said of different
<div n="lb">forms of dharma, {%religion%}, and specifically thinking of the
<div n="lb">three yānas): tulye (so with Kashgar rec., text tulya-)
<div n="lb">nāma dharmadhātupraveśe SP 60.8 (prose), {%when entrance%}
<div n="lb">{%into the sphere of religion is, after all%} (nāma), {%alike%} (all the
<div n="lb">same, open to free choice); the sequel complains that the
<div n="lb">speaker has been given only the hīna yāna by the Buddha;
<div n="lb">tulyeṣu dharmeṣu SP 61.12; 62.2 (both vss). Chinese
<div n="lb">versions confirm this interpretation.
