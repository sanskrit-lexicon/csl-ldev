{@avakoṭimaka@}¦, adj. (= Pali okoṭ°), {%deformed, mis-%}
<div n="lb">{%shapen%}; so Tib. acc. to Speyer, byad (on i.280.3 byed)
<div n="lb">ṅan po; the precise mg. in Pali is disputed; Av i.280.3
<div n="lb">and ii.152.10, in phrase durvarṇo durdarśano ava°; in Pali
<div n="lb">only in corresp. phrase dubbaṇṇa duddas(s)ika oko°. But
<div n="lb">mss. of Av avahoṭimako or °ḍimako, and in ii.152.10
<div n="lb">Speyer adopts the latter, stating that it is also written
<div n="lb">so in the Ratnāvadānamālā version of the same story.
<div n="lb">It seems that it should be the same as the Pali word,
<div n="lb">which is well attested. Yet I think the form with h is
<div n="lb">supported by Laṅk 27.4, mss. uhātrimā, ed. em. uhoḍimā,
<div n="lb">and 33.15, text ahoḍimā, most mss. uho°; both initially
<div n="lb">in anuṣṭubh lines, where avaho° could be read as a stan-
<div n="lb">dard hypermetric type, or u- could stand for ava- (cf.
<div n="lb">§ 3.55, {@ukirati@}); Tib. cited as ṅan paḥi mi, {%miserable%}
<div n="lb">{%man%}, in Suzuki, Index, which attributes to Wogihara
<div n="lb">the interpretation ūnendriya (fitting our word).
