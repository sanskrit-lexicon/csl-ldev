2 {@eva@}¦ in the sense of evam, occurs in the cpd. {@evarūpa@},
<div n="lb">q.v.; also (in vss, m.c.) as separate word, LV 55.21; 76.2;
<div n="lb">216.8. In LV 238.18 (prose) Lefm. reads: te 'bruvan, eva
<div n="lb">hy etat paśyāmaḥ; Calc. evaṃ for eva (not noted by Lefm.);
<div n="lb">Weller ignores the passage; the only v.l. is naiva for eva;
<div n="lb">either this, or evaṃ, must surely be read. Possibly (since
<div n="lb">the Calc. v.l. evaṃ is not noted) eva is a mere misprint
<div n="lb">(but it is not corrected).
