{@Amarā, (1)@}¦ n. of a smith's daughter (= later Yaśo-
<div n="lb">dharā), who married Mahauṣadha; heroine of a Jātaka
<div n="lb">which = the Pali Sūci-j., No. 387: Mv ii.83.19 ff.; colo-
<div n="lb">phon 89.11 Amarāye karmāradhītāye jātakam. In the
<div n="lb">Sūci-j. the characters are unnamed; but (Pali) Mahosadha
[Page063-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">is the hero of the Mahāummagga-j., No. 546, and Amarā
<div n="lb">is his wife. This has misled both CPD and DPPN into
<div n="lb">identifying {%this%} Pali Jātaka with the story of Mv. Actually
<div n="lb">the stories are quite different, and Mv agrees with the
<div n="lb">Sūci-j., which, to be sure, acc. to the Story of the Present,
<div n="lb">belongs to the same occasion as the Mahāummagga;
<div n="lb">hence doubtless the transfer of the names of the hero
<div n="lb">and heroine from one to the other. Which was the original?
<div n="lb">({@2@}) n. of a river: Māy 253.6; in a list between Viśvāmitrā
<div n="lb">and Tāmarā; not in Kirfel; perhaps read Amalā? (but
<div n="lb">this also is not recorded as a river-name).
