{@? cedācitta@}¦, instr. cedācittena LV 431.12 (prose; so
<div n="lb">only one ms.; v.l., two mss., °cintena; all other mss. and
<div n="lb">Calc. have a haplographic omission here), is uninterpretable
<div n="lb">to me; I must assume a corruption, perhaps a misprint.
<div n="lb">Not noted by Weller. Foucaux's Tib. omits the passage.
<div n="lb">(The particle ced can, it seems, hardly be involved.)
