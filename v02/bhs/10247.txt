{@pratyaya@}¦, m. (once {@praccaya@}, q.v.; in mg. 1 Skt.;
<div n="lb">in all mgs. = Pali paccaya), ({@1@}) {%cause%}; often clearly a
<div n="lb">synonym of hetu, tho metaphysical writers try to distin-
<div n="lb">guish the two in various ways; see e.g. AbhidhK. LaV-P.

<div n="lb">cittotpāda in a Bodhisattva are listed, the pratyaya being
<div n="lb">{%occasions%}, conjunctions of events which stimulate cittot-
<div n="lb">pāda; they are external to the Bodhisattva, while the 4

<div n="lb">idaṃpratyayā 66.1; esp. in the {@pratītya-samutpāda@},

<div n="lb">even in prose it may be modulated with avoidance of this

<div n="lb">saṃbhava (Bhvr. adj., {%dependent in origin%}) Suv 57.14;
<div n="lb">60.6; 61.2; otherwise used quite as in Skt., {%cause%}, e.g.

<div n="lb">19.9; 20.20; 40.17 yāna is misprinted for glāna); here
<div n="lb">the word pratyaya (Tib. on Mvy 5893 misprinted gos,
<div n="lb">read gso with Tib. Index and 6139) means substantially
<div n="lb">{%cure%}, orig. however clearly {%(required) means (of treatment)%};
<div n="lb">note that pratyaya in BHS is {%not%} used as equivalent of

[Page376-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">where a marginal gloss has pratyekabuddha (which would
<div n="lb">be unmetr.); so also pratyaya-jina Dbh.g. 51(77.)2; and
<div n="lb">pratyaya-yāna = pratyeka-(buddha-) yāna Śikṣ 328.8 (vs;
<div n="lb">follows śrāvakayāna, and followed by uttama-yāna =
<div n="lb">mahāyāna; misunderstood by Bendall and Rouse); the
<div n="lb">same mg. is expressed by pratyayair jinā(ḥ) LV 443.17
<div n="lb">(vs; refers to pratyekabuddhas, mentioned two lines be-
<div n="lb">fore); the application of the term is made clear by a
<div n="lb">passage in SP ch. 3, p. 80, where first, line 5 f., we read:
<div n="lb">tatra kecit sattvāḥ paraghoṣaśravānugamanam ākāṅk-
<div n="lb">ṣamāṇā ātmaparinirvāṇahetoś caturāryasatyānubodhāya
<div n="lb">tathāgataśāsane 'bhiyujyante, ta ucyante śrāvakayānam
<div n="lb">ākāṅkṣamāṇās…(the hīnayāna followers); then, 8 f.,
<div n="lb">anye sattvā anācāryakaṃ jñānaṃ damaśamatham ākāṅk-
<div n="lb">ṣamāṇā ātmaparinirvāṇahetor hetu-pratyayānubodhāya
<div n="lb">tathāgataśāsane 'bhiyujyante, ta ucyante pratyeka-
<div n="lb">buddhayānam ākāṅkṣamāṇās…; and finally, 11 ff.,
<div n="lb">apare punaḥ sattvāḥ sarvajñajñānaṃ…ākāṅkṣamāṇā…
<div n="lb">sarvasattvaparinirvāṇahetos tathāgatajñānabalavaiśārad-
<div n="lb">yānubodhāya tathāgataśāsane 'bhiyujyante, ta ucyante
<div n="lb">mahāyānam ākāṅkṣamāṇās…; here it is very clearly
<div n="lb">characteristic of pratyekabuddhas that they seek {%to%}
<div n="lb">{%understand%} (anubodhāya) {%grounds and reasons%}, whereas
<div n="lb">śrāvakas seek to understand only {%the four noble truths%},
<div n="lb">and mahāyānists seek to understand the whole {%knowledge%},
<div n="lb">etc., {%of Tathāgatas%}. The śrāvakas are also said to be con-
<div n="lb">tent with following what they hear said by others (i.e.
<div n="lb">of the gospel); pratyekabuddhas go deeper, but not so
<div n="lb">deep as mahāyānists. In Prāt 520.9 pratyaya-pravāraṇāyā
<div n="lb">(see {@pravāraṇā@}) is, in a v.l., read pratyeka-prav°, which
<div n="lb">seems to have been the reading used by Chin. ({%secrète%});
<div n="lb">the Pali parallel, however, Vin. iv.102.38, has cātumāsa-
<div n="lb">paccaya-pavāraṇā, and the old comm., Vin. iv.103.4 ff.,
<div n="lb">understands paccaya = gilāna-paccaya, i.e. our 2 above;
<div n="lb">it may be that some confusion has occurred in the tradition;
<div n="lb">did the Prāt redactor, reading pratyaya-, have in mind
<div n="lb">both the above-mentioned use of pratyaya-buddha for
<div n="lb">pratyeka-b°, and at the same time the curious use of
<div n="lb">{@pratyeka@} described under that word (and did he even
<div n="lb">substitute pratyaya for it)?
