<L>15603<pc>549,2<k1>सचेत्<k2>सचेत्, सचे
{@sacet, sace@}¦, conj. (Pali sace; see also {@saca, saci;@}
{@sa-@}, q.v., with cet, formed as pendant to no cet, Pali
no-ce; so Childers and Andersen, Reader; otherwise, but
to me unconvincingly, Geiger 105.2, Pischel 423), {%if%}; very
common in most texts, prose as well as vss, and usually
[Page550-a+ 71]
retaining in writing the final -t or -d: Mvy 5433; SP 47.13;
78.10; 97.3; 322.4 etc.; LV (common, usually printed sa
cet by Lefm.) 101.12; 226.4; 408.4 (the only passage
noted Weller, as not Skt.); Mv (common) ii.88.10; 141.3;

8.4; 48.15; Gv 138.19; Bbh 20.20 etc. (common); Vaj 21.3;
Sukh 11.9, 12, 15 etc.; Karmav 26.12; Bhīk 3a.3; Laṅk
261.13 (rare in Laṅk; not in Index, no other case noted
by me); sace not common, and in prose only in Mv, e.g.
ii.158.13; 428.18; iii.54.14; sace, v.l. sacet, iii.187.7 (vs);
see saci; saṃdhi forms in which either sace or saca might
be understood, sacāsya (pron. asya) Mv i.323.21; iii.318.11
(both prose); saceha (-iha) SP 31.11 (vs); sacaiva, ms. Ḱ
saceva, prob. containing evam rather than eva, SP 31.9;

(if you like), {%still I would not…%}; in a formula introducing
a question, in most cases a double (alternative) question,
saced (sacet, sacen) manyatha (twice both mss. and twice

bhikṣavaḥ Mv iii.337.11, 20; 338.5; 339.16; 340.2; in the
corresp. passage in Pali, Vin. i.14.5, taṃ kiṃ maññatha
bhikkhave, which is common also in BHS (kiṃ manyatha
bhikṣavaḥ, or the like); does this Mv version have a
different mg.? Perhaps {%suppose, monks, you consider%} (the
following question)?
