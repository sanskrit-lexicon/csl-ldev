{@cakṣus@}¦, in pañca-c° (= Pali pañca-cakkhu), {%the five%}
<div n="lb">{%superior qualities of vision%} (partly physical, partly mental
<div n="lb">or spiritual) possessed by a Buddha (cf. pañcacakṣuḥ-
<div n="lb">samanvāgata LV 3.5; 403.2, of Buddha): listed, in agree-
<div n="lb">ment except for order, Dharmas 66; Sūtrāl. xviii.54,
<div n="lb">comm.; and Mv i.158.1 ff., where each is explained in
<div n="lb">some detail, viz. māṃsa-c° 158.8--159.5; divya-c° 159.5--7;
<div n="lb">prajñā-c° 159.8--9; dharma-c° 159.9--160.7 (= daśānāṃ
<div n="lb">balānāṃ manovibhutā, 159.10; then follows a statement
<div n="lb">on the 10 bala, 159.12--160.5, in verse); and buddha-c°
<div n="lb">160.7--16 (this = the 18 āveṇikā buddhadharmāḥ, which
<div n="lb">are then listed). In Pali (see Childers and PTSD) the list
<div n="lb">contains maṃsa-, dibba-, paññā-, and buddha-cakkhu,
<div n="lb">but for dharma- substitutes samanta-c° (before or after
<div n="lb">buddha-c°). A difficult and corrupt line, Mv i.42.15 =
<div n="lb">53.12 = 337.4 (in the last printed by Senart as prose),
<div n="lb">contains some form of bhava-cakṣuka, which Senart
<div n="lb">regards as containing a *bhava-cakṣu(s) = māṃsa-c°,
<div n="lb">quite wrongly; his transl. (note on 42.15) misunderstands
<div n="lb">māṃsa-c° which is a complimentary and superior power,
<div n="lb">not one to be derogated. Possibly rather {%eye of existence%}
<div n="lb">and agreeing with prajñā-skandha (337.4 prajñā-cakṣu[r])?
<div n="lb">The preponderant evidence of the mss. points to bhava-
<div n="lb">cakṣuke (or °ko or °kaiḥ) apāye prajñāskandho (or °dhe,
<div n="lb">°dhā; 337.4 see above) niveśeyaṃ (? °yaḥ, or other vv.ll.).
<div n="lb">All too obscure to be useful.
