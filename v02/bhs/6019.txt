{@cakṣus@}¦, in pañca-c° (= Pali pañca-cakkhu), {%the five%}
{%superior qualities of vision%} (partly physical, partly mental
or spiritual) possessed by a Buddha (cf. pañcacakṣuḥ-
samanvāgata LV 3.5; 403.2, of Buddha): listed, in agree-
ment except for order, Dharmas 66; Sūtrāl. xviii.54,
comm.; and Mv i.158.1 ff., where each is explained in
some detail, viz. māṃsa-c° 158.8--159.5; divya-c° 159.5--7;
prajñā-c° 159.8--9; dharma-c° 159.9--160.7 (= daśānāṃ
balānāṃ manovibhutā, 159.10; then follows a statement
on the 10 bala, 159.12--160.5, in verse); and buddha-c°
160.7--16 (this = the 18 āveṇikā buddhadharmāḥ, which
are then listed). In Pali (see Childers and PTSD) the list
contains maṃsa-, dibba-, paññā-, and buddha-cakkhu,
but for dharma- substitutes samanta-c° (before or after
buddha-c°). A difficult and corrupt line, Mv i.42.15 =
53.12 = 337.4 (in the last printed by Senart as prose),
contains some form of bhava-cakṣuka, which Senart
regards as containing a *bhava-cakṣu(s) = māṃsa-c°,
quite wrongly; his transl. (note on 42.15) misunderstands
māṃsa-c° which is a complimentary and superior power,
not one to be derogated. Possibly rather {%eye of existence%}
and agreeing with prajñā-skandha (337.4 prajñā-cakṣu[r])?
The preponderant evidence of the mss. points to bhava-
cakṣuke (or °ko or °kaiḥ) apāye prajñāskandho (or °dhe,
°dhā; 337.4 see above) niveśeyaṃ (? °yaḥ, or other vv.ll.).
All too obscure to be useful.
