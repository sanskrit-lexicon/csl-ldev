<div n="lb">manyadhvam AsP 94.12, {%don't think this existent (physical)%}
<div n="lb">{%body%} (of Tathāgatas) {%is their body%} (but rather regard the

<div n="lb">seems little doubt of the etym. and fundamental meaning
<div n="lb">of this word (probably no one now agrees with Childers
<div n="lb">that it was orig. sva-kāya); and the scholastic fantasies
<div n="lb">of various schools listed by LaV-P. in AbhidhK. v.15--17
<div n="lb">need not be recorded here, tho they evidently influenced
<div n="lb">Tib. and Chin. interpretations.
