{@? asaṃkhyaya@}¦, adj., {%innumerable%}, occurs repeatedly
<div n="lb">(instead of regular asaṃkhyeya) in mss. of LV, and is
<div n="lb">sometimes adopted by Lefm. in the text: 86.15 (vv.ll.
<div n="lb">asaṃkhya, asaṃkhyeya); 112.4 (with most mss., v.l.
<div n="lb">°khyeya). Weller 23 would read asaṃkhyeya always,
<div n="lb">perhaps rightly; but the frequent occurrence of °khyaya
<div n="lb">in the mss. is strange. Like Weller I am unable to under-
<div n="lb">stand the long ā in asaṃkhyayā-kalpakoṭi- 86.15; pro-
<div n="lb">bably read °ya- as in 112.4. Instr. of a-saṃkhyā unlikely.
