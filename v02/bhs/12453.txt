[{@yāt@}¦, Lefm. in LV 62.12 (prose), evidently supposed
<div n="lb">to mean {%since%} (Vedic yāt, assumed by Pischel 427 as base
<div n="lb">for Pkt. jā, which others derive from Skt. yāvat). But no
<div n="lb">ms. reads yāt; some yā, others omit the word (prob. with
<div n="lb">orig. text) or have other variants. Such a Pktism, and a
<div n="lb">dubious one at that, can hardly be assumed in the prose
<div n="lb">of LV.]
