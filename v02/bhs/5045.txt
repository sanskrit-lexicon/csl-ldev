{@kuśalapuṇya@}¦, {%meritorious deed of virtue%}, in Mv
<div n="lb">i.81.1--2 contrasted with kuśalamūla, but whether the for-
<div n="lb">mer marks a higher, more developed stage of religious
<div n="lb">advancement than the latter (as Senart seems to believe),
<div n="lb">is not clear to me: (ye punar…) bodhisattvā avaivartika-
<div n="lb">tāyai pariṇāmenti, kin tu khalu teṣām upacita-kuśala-
<div n="lb">puṇyānāṃ prathamā praṇidhir utpadyati, āho svid
<div n="lb">upacita-kuśalamūlānām iti.The reply, in vss, first says
<div n="lb">that worship of Buddhas etc. does not suffice. Then (81.16)
<div n="lb">te yadā vipula-puṇya-saṃcayā, bhonti bhāvita-śarīra-
<div n="lb">mānasāḥ; te…bodhaye upajanenti mānasaṃ; yaṃ mayā
<div n="lb">kuśalamūlam arjitaṃ, tena me bhavatu sarvadarśitā;…
<div n="lb">(82.3) yaś ca me kuśalamūla-saṃcayo, so mahā bhavatu
<div n="lb">sarvaprāṇibhiḥ…Is puṇya of 81.16 something else than
<div n="lb">kuśala-puṇya of 81.1--2? Both it and kuśala-mūla seem,
<div n="lb">as far as I can tell, to have the same effect in the verses;
<div n="lb">no clear answer to the question in the prose has been
<div n="lb">discovered by me.
