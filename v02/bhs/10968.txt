{@buddha-kṣetra@}¦, nt. (= Pali, late, °khetta), {%Buddha-%}
<div n="lb">{%field, region or%} (usually) {%world%} or {%world-system%} in which a
<div n="lb">particular Buddha lives and operates; see Teresina Rowell,
<div n="lb">‘The background and early use of the Buddhakṣetra
<div n="lb">concept,’ The Eastern Buddhist 6.199--430 and 7.131--176,
<div n="lb">where the term is ably discussed; a few out of many
<div n="lb">occurrences are here recorded: descriptions of a b°, SP
<div n="lb">65.9 ff.; 144.9 ff.; its ‘jewels’ are Bodhisattvas SP 66.3;
<div n="lb">in Mv ii.301.16 Bodhisattvas in numberless b° take the
<div n="lb">form of gods and come to Śākyamuni as he is about to
<div n="lb">become enlightened; misc., Mvy 3065; Mv ii.319.11;
<div n="lb">349.17; iii.139.3; 342.1; in Mv i.123.4 ff. enumeration of
<div n="lb">some ‘present’ Buddha-fields and their Buddhas; huddha-
<div n="lb">kṣetraṃ viśodhenti bodhisattvā(ḥ) Mv i.283.3; atuliya
<div n="lb">(so mss.) aprameyaṃ °traṃ aparimitaṃ bharitvā ({%having%}
<div n="lb">{%filled%}) sameti (= śamayati) khila-doṣa-mohaṃ (so read,
<div n="lb">see s.v. {@khila@}) Mv ii.295.9; on {%‘emptying’%} of buddha-fields,
<div n="lb">see s.v. {@riñcati@}; in Mv i.121.14 ff. the question is asked
<div n="lb">whether Buddhas are produced in all Buddha-fields, and
<div n="lb">the answer, 122.2--3, is negative; in many there is no
<div n="lb">Buddha; Śikṣ 147.15 speaks of going to a buddhaśūnya-
<div n="lb">buddhakṣetram as an evil fate; so in SP 68.2 (vs; cf.
<div n="lb">66.3 ff., prose, same subject) buddhakṣetra is clearly
<div n="lb">equated with {@lokadhātu@}, meaning merely {%world-system%},
<div n="lb">presumably as {%potential field for a Buddha%}, but not ne-
<div n="lb">cessarily containing one; on this see Rowell, op. cit., 415.
