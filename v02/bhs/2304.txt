{@a-vyābadhya@}¦ or {@°vadhya@}, adj. and nt. subst. (see
<div n="lb">next, and cf. Pali avyāpajjha, as mentioned there), ({@1@})
<div n="lb">adj., {%that cannot be injured%} or {%disturbed, inviolable%}: Mv
<div n="lb">ii.259.15 °dhyaṃ (ms.)…dharmaṃ deśayiṣyati; 279.9
<div n="lb">°dhyaṃ arthaṃ prārthayamāno; in both of these spelled
<div n="lb">avyāvadhyaṃ, and associated with asādhāraṇaṃ; ({@2@}) ap-
<div n="lb">parently subst., {%not doing harm%} (so Tib., gnod pa mi
<div n="lb">byed): LV 380.17 avyābadhyaṃ (Foucaux {%la mansuétude%})
<div n="lb">sukhaṃ loke. There is a v.l., in mss. usually regarded as
<div n="lb">the best, adhyāvadhya; one might conjecture a-vyā-
<div n="lb">vadhya, or °bādhya, ger., {%not committing injury%}. But the
<div n="lb">context suggests that a nom. sg. noun is intended, sukhaṃ
<div n="lb">being apparently predicate (Foucaux {%douce%}): so Tib.
<div n="lb">takes it. In all of these forms the root vadh may have
<div n="lb">been felt to be concerned; or the short a of the root may
<div n="lb">be semi-MIndic (based on forms of bādh which are cer-
<div n="lb">tainly commoner).
