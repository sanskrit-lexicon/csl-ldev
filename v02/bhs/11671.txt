Acc. to PTSD, ‘when kappa stands by itself, a Mahākappa
is understood’. In Pali it is said to be the most inclusive
(i.e. the longest) kind of kappa. For some Pali schemes
of its relation to other kappas see PTSD and Childers;
for alleged northern Buddhist schemes see LaVallée
Poussin, AbhidhK, references in Index. In works here
included I have noted no precise definition.)
