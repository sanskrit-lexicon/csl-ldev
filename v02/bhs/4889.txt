{@kilikīlate@}¦, {%makes a loud noise%} (of Māra's army):
<div n="lb">pres. pple. °lamānā(ḥ), n. pl., seems the probable reading
<div n="lb">at Mv ii.339.6 (vs), as suggested by mss. (which have hyper-
<div n="lb">Skt. krīḍ- for kīl-) and meter; Senart reads kilikilāyamānā,
<div n="lb">which gives the meaning required (see s.v. {@kilikila@}), but
<div n="lb">is hypermetric by one short syllable.
