{@andhakārāpita-tva@}¦, nt. (abstr. from caus. pple. to
<div n="lb">denom. verb from andhakāra, {%darkness%}), {%state of being%}
<div n="lb">{%darkened%}; so (or, possibly, andhakārāyita-tva, from non-
<div n="lb">caus. denom. pple.) I would read at Mv i.41.5; 229.20;
<div n="lb">240.9; ii.162.9; iii.334.7; 341.12. The mss. are corrupt in
<div n="lb">the entire passage (see {@lokāntarikā@}) and particularly at
<div n="lb">this point; Senart reads °kārārpitā, but there is no support
<div n="lb">for the -r- in the mss. The Mv seems to have read an-
<div n="lb">dhakārā andhakārāpitatvā (? °yitatvā), tamisrā {@tamisrā-@}
<div n="lb">{@yitatvā@} (q.v.), {%darknesses, darkenednesses, glooms, begloomed-%}
<div n="lb">{%nesses%}. Only Mv has the second member of each pair (the
<div n="lb">derivatives of denom. pples.); the other parallel passages
<div n="lb">point to something like andhakārā {@andhakāratamisrāḥ@},
<div n="lb">q.v.
