<div n="lb">{%tion to such a kind of doctrine%} (of heretics, mentioned in

<div n="lb">opposes taking pravādi as loc. for °de; this construction
<div n="lb">would in any case be difficult, since śūnyā could then not
<div n="lb">agree with this word (as Tib. makes it and as natural
<div n="lb">interpretation requires); to take śūnyā with bhūmir in
<div n="lb">prec. line would be forced. No v.l. is recorded for pravādi
<div n="lb">(Calc. with some mss. reads śūnya-); perhaps it should be
<div n="lb">em. to °da (n. sg., for °daḥ).
