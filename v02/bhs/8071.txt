[{@Nandopananda@}¦, Divy 307.1; 329.9, 14, acc. to ed.
name of one individual monk, a member or associate of
the ṣaḍvargīya or ṣaḍvargika group, which acc. to Mvy
9471--2 contained two monks named Nanda and Upananda.
This is, I believe, also the intention of Divy. In 307.1
understand Nandopananda- as cpd. with the following
bhṛtaka-puruṣaḥ sa, {%he%} (the householder just mentioned)
{%is a serving-man of Nanda and Upananda%}. In 329.9 and 14
understand two vocs., Nanda-Upananda. However, in
MSV i.95.4 Nandopananda, sg., is presented in the text
as n. of one nāga king; cf. s.v. {@Nanda@} 2.]
