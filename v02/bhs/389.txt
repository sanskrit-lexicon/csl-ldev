{@adṛśyā@}¦ (not recorded in this sense), probably to be
read for text ādṛśyā, n. of a magic herb (which makes
invisible): Gv 498.1, 2; in line 2 could be either a- or ā-,
in saṃdhi; but the stem, in composition, is printed as
ending in -a, for which probably read -ā; in line 1 text
asty ādṛśyā nāmauṣadhiḥ.
