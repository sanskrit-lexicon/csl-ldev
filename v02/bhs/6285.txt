{@citritaka@}¦, adj. (Skt. °ta with endearing dim. -ka,
<div n="lb">§ 22.34), {%made bright, adorned%}: (tava rūpa surūpa suśo-
<div n="lb">bhanake) vasavarti sulakṣaṇa citritake LV 321.(21--)22
<div n="lb">(vs); said by the daughters of Māra to the Bodhisattva;
<div n="lb">the e-forms seem scarcely construable with suvasantake
<div n="lb">in line 19 (nor does Tib. take them so; Calc. reads suśo-
<div n="lb">bhanako and citritako, but all mss. °ke in both); accord-
<div n="lb">ingly it seems that, if the mss. are right, we must under-
<div n="lb">stand them either as n. sg. nt. in e, with rūpa (§ 8.37),
<div n="lb">or as voc. sg. m., addressed to the Bodhisattva (§ 8.28).
