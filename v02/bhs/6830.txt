<L>6830<pc>249,1<k1>तदाहिं<k2>तदाहिं
[{@tadāhiṃ@}¦ is apparently understood by Senart as
<div n="lb">meaning {%then%} in Mv ii.69.5 (prose), yadā bhagavāṃ pravṛt-
<div n="lb">tadharmacakro tadāhiṃ etaṃ bhikṣubhi śrutaṃ. But mss.
<div n="lb">tadā hi or tadā hi-m-(i.e., I suppose, ‘hiatus-bridging’ m
<div n="lb">before following vowel); I think the particle hi must be
<div n="lb">assumed, after tadā. Perhaps Senart assumed a blend of
<div n="lb">tadā with (e)tar(a)hi(ṃ).]
