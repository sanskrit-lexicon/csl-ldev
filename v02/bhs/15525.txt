{@? saṃkīyati@}¦, in Mv iii.37.9, text, tām eva agragaṇi-
<div n="lb">kāṃ °yanto śayito, presumably understood as {%went to bed%}
<div n="lb">{%thinking about that courtesan%} (and enjoyed her in dreams
<div n="lb">all night). The form is very dubious; it cannot = Pali
<div n="lb">saṃkīyati which is pass. to {@saṃkirati@}, q.v., and not
<div n="lb">connected with Pali saṅkati, Skt. śaṅkate (PTSD connects
<div n="lb">it with both at once!), Chap. 43, s.v. śaṅk. If our form
<div n="lb">is right, I can only understand it as a MIndic passive to
<div n="lb">Skt. caus. śaṅkayati, {%makes concerned%}; it would then
<div n="lb">mean, {%being made concerned with…%} There is a v.l. sakrī-
<div n="lb">ḍanto; read saṃkrīḍanto, {%amusing himself%} (in thoughts)?
