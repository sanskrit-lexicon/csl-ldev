{@kāma-guṇa@}¦, m. pl. (= Pali id., defined as {%the objects%}
{%of the five senses%}, e.g. AN iii.411.4 ff.), {%qualities of desire%},
regularly five in number, in some passages clearly under-
stood as the objects of the five senses as in Pali; so Mv
iii.417.2 pañca kāmaguṇe (n. pl.; read °ṇā?) loke manaḥ-
ṣaṣṭhā praveditā (so read with mss.), tatra me vigato
chando…; SP 79.8 (mā…'bhiramadhvaṃ hīneṣu) rūpa-
śabda-gandha-rasa-sparśeṣu; atra hi yūyaṃ traidhātuke
'bhiratāḥ pañca-kāmaguṇa-sahagatayā tṛṣṇayā dahyatha;
yet in Mv ii.116.17 pañca kāmaguṇāṃ (acc. pl.), specifically
listed as nāṭyaṃ gītaṃ vāditaṃ tūryaṃ striyo; the fact
seems to be that the phrase became a stock formula or
cliché, often used without definite association with any
list; so Mvy 5378, 7373 mentions the 5 kāmaguṇa, but
never lists them (in 871 even the number 5 is lacking). The
old tradition that they are the objects of the 5 senses
never died out, however; see LaVallée-Poussin, AbhidhK.
iii.86 note 2. With the number 5 they are mentioned SP
78.12; 111.6; 213.6; LV 186.19; 215.3; Mv i.31.5; ii.170.13,
etc.; without the number e.g. LV 45.4; 173.19 and 22
(cited Śikṣ 204.7 and 10); Mv ii.142.5, 12.
