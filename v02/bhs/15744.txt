{@saṃdṛśyati@}¦, {%sees%}: Gv 523.20--21 yathā māyākāro…
<div n="lb">sarvarūpagatāni sarvakriyāś ca saṃdṛśyati (by his magic
<div n="lb">power). Seems to be a nonce-formation analogical to
<div n="lb">saṃdṛśyante, regular passive, {%they are seen%}, which occurs
<div n="lb">three times in the text just before (lines 16, 18, 20); the
<div n="lb">meaning is confirmed by the following conclusion of the
<div n="lb">simile: evam eva sudhanaḥ…tāni sarvavyūhavikurvi-
<div n="lb">tāny adrākṣīt. To the pass. saṃdṛśyate, {%is seen%}, was formed
<div n="lb">an active saṃdṛśyati, {%sees%}. The same seems true once of
<div n="lb">{@dṛśyati@}, q.v.
