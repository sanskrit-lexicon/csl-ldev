{@Vaihāya@}¦, acc. to all mss, Mv i.70.16 (parvatasya
<div n="lb">vaihāya-varasya, vs), kept by Senart, = Skt. Vaibhāra
<div n="lb">(or Vaihāra, once Mbh.), n. of a mountain outside Rājagṛha.
<div n="lb">In Pali and AMg. the only form recorded is Vebhāra.
<div n="lb">See Senart's note ad loc.; he assumes Prakritic y for r,
<div n="lb">but Geiger 46.3, Pischel 255 make the interchange of y
<div n="lb">and r seem doubtful. Could this form be influenced by
<div n="lb">vaihāyasa, etc. (by popular etymology)?
