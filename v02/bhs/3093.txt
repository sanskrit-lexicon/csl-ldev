[{@āsphāra@}¦, {%tearing%}, acc. to Senart, Mv i.9.16, in a
corrupt line of vs; ed. em. sadāyasaphālāsphārā, see note
p. 377. But Senart failed to note that the passage i.9.8--
12.14 is repeated in iii.454.7--456.20. This line occurs
iii.454.15, reading kadaryatapanā ghorā, which disproves
at least part of Senart's em. and is close enough to the
reading of the mss. at i.9.16 to make it acceptable as a
whole.]
