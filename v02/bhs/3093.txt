[{@āsphāra@}¦, {%tearing%}, acc. to Senart, Mv i.9.16, in a
<div n="lb">corrupt line of vs; ed. em. sadāyasaphālāsphārā, see note
<div n="lb">p. 377. But Senart failed to note that the passage i.9.8--
<div n="lb">12.14 is repeated in iii.454.7--456.20. This line occurs
<div n="lb">iii.454.15, reading kadaryatapanā ghorā, which disproves
<div n="lb">at least part of Senart's em. and is close enough to the
<div n="lb">reading of the mss. at i.9.16 to make it acceptable as a
<div n="lb">whole.]
