{@Nīla-kāyika@}¦, n. of a class of gods, noted only in
<div n="lb">LV 383.9 °kair devaputrair, and 11 {@Vairocano@} (q.v., 7)
<div n="lb">nāma Nīlakāyiko devaputraḥ. I have been unable to find
<div n="lb">anything more about this term. Tib. renders sṅon po
<div n="lb">({%blue%}) ris ({%form, figure%}; also {%party%}, like BHS {@kāya@}). This
<div n="lb">suggests that Tib. understood {%belonging to the group of%}
<div n="lb">{%Nīla (blue) ones%}, rather than {%blue-bodied%}. In LV they,
<div n="lb">and their spokesman Vairocana, seem to be superior to
<div n="lb">the four {@mahārāja@} gods.
