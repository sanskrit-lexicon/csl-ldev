{@kaśambaka-jāta@}¦ (also written kaṣ°, kas°; = Pali
<div n="lb">kasambu-jāta, with var. kasambuka-j°), acc. to Tib. on
<div n="lb">Mvy, {%rotten%}; this is consistent with the lit. mg. in Pali,
<div n="lb">applied to a tree the inside of which is rotten, see s.v.
<div n="lb">{@avasruta@}; the orig. mg. was forgotten in Pali at an early
<div n="lb">time, as the vague and inconsistent Pali comms. show;
<div n="lb">e.g. Vin. ii.236.26, comm. 1287.5 = ākiṇṇadosataya

<div n="lb">follows antarpūty avasrutaḥ (all part of a longer cliché
<div n="lb">found repeatedly in Pali, e.g. in Vin. and Pugg.p., ll.cc.);
<div n="lb">MSV i.50.7 kaṣ°; Śikṣ 67.20 kaśambakajāto aśramaṇaḥ
<div n="lb">etc. (as in Mvy 9143--4); AsP 181.20 kas°. Could this
<div n="lb">word be related to kasavva Deśīn. 2.53, said to have
<div n="lb">four mgs., (1) stokam, (2) ārdram, {%wet%}, (3) pracuraṃ,
<div n="lb">(4) bāṣpaḥ? By the ‘law of morae’ kasamba could be
<div n="lb">related to Deśī kasavva.
