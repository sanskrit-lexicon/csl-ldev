{@aparāntaka@}¦, f. {@°ikā@}, adj. {%of the western border, or of%}
<div n="lb">{%the country called Aparānta%}; used of cloth or garments,
<div n="lb">also as nt. noun, (cloth or garments) {%of Aparānta%} Mvy 9179;
<div n="lb">°ka- in cpd. Divy 316.26, of garments (adj. or noun?).
<div n="lb">In Divy 20.22-23 perhaps read aparāntikayā guptikayā
<div n="lb">{%in the style of Aparānta%} (? see {@guptikā@}); text asmāt
<div n="lb">parānti°. In Divy 1.3; 18.6; 19.16, 19, 23; 21.2, 12 the mss.
<div n="lb">read corruptly, and with much variation, a text discussed
<div n="lb">by the editors on p. 703; they read asmāt parāntaka-
<div n="lb">and interpret as a synonym of {@pratyantima@}, except in
<div n="lb">19.19 where they read asmākam aparāntaka-, interpreting
<div n="lb">(with privative a-) as the opposite, {%not distant, near%}. The
<div n="lb">forms are troublesome; without much confidence I suggest
<div n="lb">that forms of aparāntaka may have been found in all,
<div n="lb">meaning something like {%of the western border%} (if not speci-
<div n="lb">fically {%of the country Aparānta%}). But Tib. (Bailey, JRAS
<div n="lb">1950.172) on 19.19 points to {@Aśmāparāntaka@}, q.v.; and
<div n="lb">this seems to have been the regular Tib. form acc. to
<div n="lb">Schiefner, cited Divy p. 703.
