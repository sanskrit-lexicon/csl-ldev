{@karmapatha@}¦, m. (nt. noted only Kv 46.1--2 daśa
kuśalāni karmapathāny; = Pali kammapatha; seems to
be a fundamentally Buddhist term, tho recorded once by
BR in Mbh. Calc. 13.583, which is followed by a list of the
ten items substantially as in Buddhism, belief in the law
of fruition of actions taking the place of No. 10, absten-
tion from heresy), {%course of action%}; almost always, as in
Pali, of a set of ten good (kuśala) actions consisting in
avoidance of ten bad (akuśala) actions, three of body
(taking life, theft, fornication or adultery), four of speech
(lying, harsh speech, spiteful speech, idle or silly, dis-
connected speech), and three of mind (covetousness,
malevolence, heresy); these are listed without use of the
term karmapatha, as daśākuśalāni and or daśa kuśalāni,
in Dharmas 56 and Mvy 1681--4, 1685--1698; but the same
list is given in texts as the ten (a)kuśala karmapatha, so
Mv i.107.13--15; Divy 301.22--25; 302.7--10; Śikṣ 69.13 ff.
and Dbh 23.6 ff., in both of which each item is treated at
some length, esp. in Śikṣ which describes the torments
suffered in hell by those guilty of each of the 10 sins; in
Mv ii.99.5--12 the ten karmapatha are slightly different;
a fourth sin of the body (use of liquor) is added, and the
number ten is kept by omitting one of the 4 sins of speech
(harshness), also avidyā, {%ignorance%}, replaces abhidhyā,
{%covetousness%} (this seems likely to be a mere corruption of
[Page171-a+ 71]
tradition); in Mv i.26.12 akuśala karmapatha is used more
loosely, of sinful acts in general, specifically exemplified
by the five {@ānantarya@}, q.v.; in Mv i.282.14 the term ten
kuśala karmapatha (in prose) is immediately followed (in
verses) by a list of ten vaśitā, apparently implying that
they are the same (not the usual 10 karmapatha); in Suv
6.11 the expression is daśakuśalamūlakarmapatha; often
a form of the verb sam-ā-dā-, {%adopt, take to, adhere to%},
governs the noun, as in Mv ii.77.11 daśa kuśalakarma-
pathāṃ (acc. pl.) samādāya; Suv 6.11…°thaṃ samādā-
payet; in Mv ii.425.10 read with mss. daśa-kuśalakarma-
patha-samādānaṃ vartitvā (= vartayitvā, {%having practised%}
{%the taking-upon-oneself, the vow, of…%}); cf. {@samādiyati,@}
{@°dāpayati, °dāna@}; other references to the 10 kuśala, or
akuśala, karmapatha, without listing, are found Mv i.3.1;
46.10; 101.18; 193.15; iii.357.14; Divy 318.22; Karmav
31.13, 14; Gv 521.4.
