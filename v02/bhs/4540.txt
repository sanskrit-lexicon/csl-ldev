<div n="lb">kuśalāni karmapathāny; = Pali kammapatha; seems to
<div n="lb">be a fundamentally Buddhist term, tho recorded once by
<div n="lb">BR in Mbh. Calc. 13.583, which is followed by a list of the
<div n="lb">ten items substantially as in Buddhism, belief in the law
<div n="lb">of fruition of actions taking the place of No. 10, absten-
<div n="lb">tion from heresy), {%course of action%}; almost always, as in
<div n="lb">Pali, of a set of ten good (kuśala) actions consisting in
<div n="lb">avoidance of ten bad (akuśala) actions, three of body
<div n="lb">(taking life, theft, fornication or adultery), four of speech
<div n="lb">(lying, harsh speech, spiteful speech, idle or silly, dis-
<div n="lb">connected speech), and three of mind (covetousness,
<div n="lb">malevolence, heresy); these are listed without use of the
<div n="lb">term karmapatha, as daśākuśalāni and or daśa kuśalāni,
<div n="lb">in Dharmas 56 and Mvy 1681--4, 1685--1698; but the same
<div n="lb">list is given in texts as the ten (a)kuśala karmapatha, so
<div n="lb">Mv i.107.13--15; Divy 301.22--25; 302.7--10; Śikṣ 69.13 ff.
<div n="lb">and Dbh 23.6 ff., in both of which each item is treated at
<div n="lb">some length, esp. in Śikṣ which describes the torments
<div n="lb">suffered in hell by those guilty of each of the 10 sins; in
<div n="lb">Mv ii.99.5--12 the ten karmapatha are slightly different;
<div n="lb">a fourth sin of the body (use of liquor) is added, and the
<div n="lb">number ten is kept by omitting one of the 4 sins of speech
<div n="lb">(harshness), also avidyā, {%ignorance%}, replaces abhidhyā,
<div n="lb">{%covetousness%} (this seems likely to be a mere corruption of
[Page171-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">tradition); in Mv i.26.12 akuśala karmapatha is used more
<div n="lb">loosely, of sinful acts in general, specifically exemplified
<div n="lb">by the five {@ānantarya@}, q.v.; in Mv i.282.14 the term ten
<div n="lb">kuśala karmapatha (in prose) is immediately followed (in
<div n="lb">verses) by a list of ten vaśitā, apparently implying that
<div n="lb">they are the same (not the usual 10 karmapatha); in Suv
<div n="lb">6.11 the expression is daśakuśalamūlakarmapatha; often
<div n="lb">a form of the verb sam-ā-dā-, {%adopt, take to, adhere to%},
<div n="lb">governs the noun, as in Mv ii.77.11 daśa kuśalakarma-
<div n="lb">pathāṃ (acc. pl.) samādāya; Suv 6.11…°thaṃ samādā-
<div n="lb">payet; in Mv ii.425.10 read with mss. daśa-kuśalakarma-
<div n="lb">patha-samādānaṃ vartitvā (= vartayitvā, {%having practised%}
<div n="lb">{%the taking-upon-oneself, the vow, of…%}); cf. {@samādiyati,@}
<div n="lb">{@°dāpayati, °dāna@}; other references to the 10 kuśala, or
<div n="lb">akuśala, karmapatha, without listing, are found Mv i.3.1;
<div n="lb">46.10; 101.18; 193.15; iii.357.14; Divy 318.22; Karmav
<div n="lb">31.13, 14; Gv 521.4.
