<div n="lb">{%this exhibition of supernatural power%}, viz, the making of the
<div n="lb">stūpa to appear? Or is it {%this fixed determination, resolution%}
<div n="lb">(2, above)? Near synonyms are {@āveśa@}, (Skt.) anubhāva,
<div n="lb">{@adhimukti@}; cf. also Laṅk 292.13 and 15, where one of the
<div n="lb">sources of abhijñā is ‘from adhiṣṭhāna’ (adhiṣṭhānān, so
<div n="lb">read in 13 for text °nāṃ, abl., before n-), which means
<div n="lb">{%from the controlling power of the Buddhas%} and is paraphrased
<div n="lb">in 15 by buddhaprasādataḥ, {%from the grace of the Buddhas%}.
<div n="lb">Suzuki, Transl. of Laṅk passim, renders {%sustaining power%};
<div n="lb">I think rather {%controlling power%}. Even Bodhisattvas are
<div n="lb">at times dependent on Buddhas and need their control;

<div n="lb">Mv i.195.1 ff.; iii.227.8 ff., adhiṣṭhānakam, where the

<div n="lb">Gv 451.26. In this curious passage, 451.25--452.6, the word
<div n="lb">adhiṣṭhāna is further used predicatively in a series of
<div n="lb">equational sentences, varying in gender like an adjective
[Page016-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">with different subjects. Bhadrottamā says to Sudhana:

<div n="lb">light from the context. I am not sure what meaning the
<div n="lb">author attributed to the word adhiṣṭhāna: presumably
<div n="lb">something like either {%basis%} or {%controlling power%}.
