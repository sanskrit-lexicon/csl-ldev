{@traividya@}¦, adj., and {@°ya-tā@}, noun (= Pali tevijja,
<div n="lb">°ja-tā), (state of) {%possessing the three knowledges%}. In Pali
<div n="lb">(see Childers s.v. vijjā and Lévi, Sutrāl. vii.9, note), these
<div n="lb">are either (1) knowledge that all is anicca, dukkha, anatta,
<div n="lb">or (2) knowledge of former births (pubbenivāsa), of the
<div n="lb">(future) rebirths of beings (cutūpapāta), and of the de-
<div n="lb">struction of the depravities (āsava-khaya); of these the
<div n="lb">first and the third are two of the {@abhijñā@} (Pali abhiññā),
<div n="lb">q.v., and the second results from another abhijñā, viz.
<div n="lb">divyacakṣus (see s.v. {@upapāda@}), so that these three abhijñā
<div n="lb">are identified in BHS as the three vidyā, AbhidhK. LaV-P.
<div n="lb">vii.108. So far as I have found, this second of the two Pali
<div n="lb">sets is the only one recognized in BHS, where the category
<div n="lb">is in any case of very restricted occurrence; I have failed
<div n="lb">to record it except in SP and LV. In SP only the adj.
<div n="lb">occurs, always associated with ṣaḍabhijña, {%having the six%}
<div n="lb">{@abhijñā@}, as in: te traividyāḥ ṣaḍabhijñā(ḥ)…SP 179.17
<div n="lb">(prose), and in verses (always separate ṣaḍabhijña from
<div n="lb">traividya! text makes them cpd.) 90.7; 129.10; 150.2;
<div n="lb">155.2; no such association in LV, where context never
<div n="lb">helps in interpretation; adj., traividya (voc.) LV 363.16
<div n="lb">(vs); noun, traividyatādhigatā 350.14 (so read with best
<div n="lb">mss. for text traividyādh°); °dyatā daśabalena…prāptā
<div n="lb">352.17; °tām anuprāptaṃ 353.13 (prose); the last suggests
<div n="lb">that in 426.13 (prose) it is necessary to em. to traividyatā-
<div n="lb">nuprāpta (text °dyānu°, no v.l.) ity ucyate (said of Buddha).
