{@kṛtya, (1)@}¦ m., a kind of demon (cf. Skt. kṛtyā, of
<div n="lb">which this may be a masc. correspondent created for the
<div n="lb">nonce, in this passage which is a list of masc. evil spirits):
<div n="lb">SP 401.5--6 kṛtyo vā vetāḍo vā…(6) yakṣakṛtyo vāmanu-
<div n="lb">ṣyakṛtyo vā manuṣyakṛtyo vā; ({@2@}) nt., or at end of adj.
<div n="lb">cpds., {%business%} etc., in some cases apparently transcending
<div n="lb">normal Skt. usage; bhakta-kṛtya (= Pali bhatta-kicca),
<div n="lb">lit. {%business of food%}, so {%a meal%}: Divy 185.22 °tyaṃ kartum
<div n="lb">ārabdhaḥ; āhāra-kṛtya, id., Divy 82.26 nānenāhāreṇāhāra-
<div n="lb">kṛtyaṃ kariṣyati, {%he will not make his meal(s) on this food%},
<div n="lb">i.e. live on this alone; Divy 236.6, text āhāraṃ (read
<div n="lb">°ra-?) kṛtyaṃ kuru, {%get your sustenance%}; acc. to Senart,
<div n="lb">note on Mv i.349.18 (p. 622), used like the Pkt. quasi-
<div n="lb">suffix -kera(ka) as substantial equivalent of gen. case-
<div n="lb">ending (Pkt. -kera is to be derived from Skt. kārya with
<div n="lb">Pischel 176; see {@-keraka@}); Senart's Index further inter-
<div n="lb">prets -kṛtye ii.97.13 as ‘periphrasis for instrumental’, but
<div n="lb">this is certainly wrong, since there gītakṛtye pramattā
<div n="lb">jaladardarake ca clearly means {%careless in their occupation%}
<div n="lb">{%with singing and the%} (musical instrument) {%jaladardaraka%};
<div n="lb">the cases where -kṛtya is alleged to be a ‘periphrasis for
<div n="lb">the gen.’ are also, in some cases, doubtful; in Mv i.349.18
<div n="lb">and 350.1 Senart rāja-kṛtyā kośāto, supposedly = {%from%}
<div n="lb">{%the king's treasury%}, but the mss. read rāja-kṛto or (v.l.
<div n="lb">in 349.18) °kṛtāto, and the latter, at least, could be inter-
<div n="lb">preted ({%the treasury made by the king%}); ii.95.4 rājakṛtyato
<div n="lb">(abl.; v.l. °tāṃ) odhṛtabhāro, {%having laid down the burden%}
<div n="lb">{%of%} (lit. {%from, away from%}) {%royal duty%}; in ii.446.14 rājakṛtye
<div n="lb">siṃhāsane rājeti kṛtva (°tvä?) upaviśāpito, {%he%} (who was
<div n="lb">actually not the king) {%was caused to sit upon the throne%}
<div n="lb">{%which was appropriate%} (really belonged) {%to the king%}; ii.478.10
<div n="lb">rājakṛtye (v.l. °kṛte) mahānase, and 12 rājakṛtyehi sūpehi,
<div n="lb">as in prec.; Senart's interpretation may however be
<div n="lb">substantially correct in the last three, and in ii.113.9
<div n="lb">rājakṛtyaṃ udyānaṃ, {%the park that belonged to the king%}.
<div n="lb">Since Skt. kṛtya is in fact a synonym of kārya in some
<div n="lb">of its uses, the comparison with Pkt. -kera(ka), from Skt.
<div n="lb">kārya, is apposite. But the two alleged parallels from LV
<div n="lb">cited by Senart in his note, above, are not sound; one
<div n="lb">rests on a false reading of the Calcutta ed., and the other
<div n="lb">is to be interpreted otherwise. ({@3@}) -kṛtya, -kṛtyaṃ, =
<div n="lb">{@-kṛtvā@} for Skt. -kṛtvas, q.v.
