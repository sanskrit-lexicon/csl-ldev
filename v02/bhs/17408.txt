{@sthavira-gāthā@}¦, pl., n. of a Buddhist work or part
<div n="lb">of one: Divy 35.1; = Pali Thera-gāthā? or, since most
<div n="lb">names in this list seem to refer to sections of Pali Sn,
[Page610-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">perhaps = Pali Sāriputta-sutta, aliter Therapañha-sutta
<div n="lb">(Sn 955--975); this seems to me more likely.
