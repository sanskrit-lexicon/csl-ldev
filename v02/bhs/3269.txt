{@ucchādana@}¦ (= Pali id., also Skt., but see below),
[Page119-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">in Mv ii.269.15 and 278.1, ucchādana-(in 278.1 Senart
<div n="lb">em. āchādana-)-parimardana-svapna- (278.1 supana-)
<div n="lb">bhedana-vikiraṇa-vidhvaṃsana-dharma, ep. of the body;
<div n="lb">corresp. to Pali anicc'ucchādana-parimaddana-bhedana-
<div n="lb">viddhaṃsana-dhammo, e.g. DN i.76.18, of which I believe
<div n="lb">the true interpretation was given by Rhys Davids, Dia-
<div n="lb">logues {@1@} (1899), p. 87 and note; ucchādana and parimar-
<div n="lb">dana are primarily shampooers' terms, {%shampooing and%}
<div n="lb">{%rubbing down%} (so Skt.), but with double entente (not
<div n="lb">recognized in Pali comms.) also {%destruction and wiping%}
<div n="lb">{%out%}; BR suggested that Skt. ucchādana was MIndic for
<div n="lb">utsādana, which means both {%rubbing down%} and {%destruction%};
<div n="lb">Skt. śātayati, {%cuts off, destroys%} (n. act. śātana), and root
<div n="lb">śad-, {%fall%} (n. act. śādana, {%das Ausfallen%}), may also be
<div n="lb">concerned, at least in part; see {@śatana@}, used in a cpd.
<div n="lb">very similar to that of Mv above; parimardana is noted
<div n="lb">in Skt. and MIndic only of shampooing (so also Mvy
<div n="lb">6779), but the verb Skt parimardati means also {%crushes,%}
<div n="lb">{%destroys%}. In KP 152.2 {@ucchada@} (q.v.) must have been
<div n="lb">limited to its shampooers' mg., since snapana follows.
<div n="lb">But in some BHS texts {@śatana@}, q.v., is substituted, elim-
<div n="lb">inating that mg. and bringing in exclusively what I (with
<div n="lb">Rh.D.) regard as the secondary, punning mg. of the Pali
<div n="lb">cpd. Rhys Davids renders {%erosion, abrasion%}, admitting
<div n="lb">that the pun is untranslatable. In American gangsters'
<div n="lb">jargon, {%to rub out%} means {%to obliterate, kill%}. We might render
<div n="lb">Mv: (the body) {%which is characterized by rubbing down%}
<div n="lb">{%(‘off’), wiping away (‘out’), sleep%} (or {%dreams%}, often symbol
<div n="lb">of impermanence; here, too, a sort of word-play), {%breaking%}
<div n="lb">{%up, scattering, destruction%}.
