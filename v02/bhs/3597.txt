{@udvedha@}¦ (m.? = Pali ubbedha, defined as {%height%};

<div n="lb">uvveha, acc. to Sheth {%height%} or {%depth%}, also zamīn-ka

<div n="lb">here preceded by figures relating to {%depth%} (extent of pene-

<div n="lb">(? see {@parigohya@}); in a close parallel, Mv iii.228.13,
<div n="lb">(iṣīkāni…) dvādaśapuruṣa-udvedhena (mss. udvehena,
<div n="lb">uddehena) is preceded by the statement of depth ({@naikha-@}
<div n="lb">{@nya@}) and by a form read by Senart tripauruṣoccāni,
<div n="lb">which would refer to {%height%} and so be inconsistent with
<div n="lb">udvedhena (which, however, if it meant {%depth%}, would
<div n="lb">be inconsistent with the preceding form containing naikha-
<div n="lb">nya); it seems that Senart should have assumed -parigohya
[Page132-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">(as in i.196.2; or some form relating to {%circumference%})
<div n="lb">instead of -ucca (mss. read -pauruṣaroccāni or -puruṣaro-
<div n="lb">ddhā, perhaps showing, in the syllable -ro-, a faint trace
<div n="lb">of that original). Senart himself saw this in his note on
<div n="lb">i.196.2, but overlooked it on iii.228.13. Cf. {@āvedha,@}
<div n="lb">{@pravedha@}.
