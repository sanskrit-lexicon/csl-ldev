<L>6860<pc>250,1<k1>तमेनं<k2>तम्-एनं
[? {@tam-enaṃ@}¦, Mv i.11.7, 11 (vss), assumed by Senart
<div n="lb">to be adverbial phrase, {%thereupon, straightway%}, and iden-
<div n="lb">tified with Pali taṃ enaṃ, Vin. i.127.32, which is so inter-
<div n="lb">preted PTSD s.v. ta-, II.4(b); neither Senart's nor PTSD's
<div n="lb">explanation seems plausible. It seems to me that acc. sg.
<div n="lb">m. pronouns may quite well be intended; if Senart is
<div n="lb">right in his em. of the rest of the text, i.11.7 would read:
<div n="lb">tam enaṃ kṛṣṇaprāṇakā agnitīkṣṇamukhā kharā, chaviṃ
<div n="lb">bhittvāna khādanti…, {%him…they eat, cutting his skin%};
<div n="lb">and similarly line 11 where tam enaṃ may depend on
<div n="lb">khādanti in line 12. In the Pali passage, also, I believe
<div n="lb">pronouns are to be assumed, anticipating taṃ bhikkhuṃ
<div n="lb">of the next line, altho the construction is indeed excep-
<div n="lb">tionally loose.]
