{@aniñjya:@}¦ variants {@āniñja, an°, āniñjya, ānijya,@}
<div n="lb">{@āneñj(y)a, an°@}, qq.v. The nasalless ānijya occurs without
<div n="lb">v.l. only once and may be an accidental corruption
<div n="lb">(anusvāra omitted); but see § 2.73. The omission of y
<div n="lb">after j is called ‘une orthographe prâcritisante’ by Senart,
<div n="lb">Mv i.399; at any rate it occurs frequently in the mss.
<div n="lb">In Pali the same word is written ānejja, ānañja, āneñja,
<div n="lb">and with short initial a- (stigmatized as wrong reading in
<div n="lb">CPD); forms with i in the penult are very rare in Pali,
<div n="lb">but CPD records aniñja-ppatta once; this surely cannot
<div n="lb">be separated from the common āneñja- (ānejja-, ānañja-)-
<div n="lb">ppatta. BHS has no ānañj- or ānejj-, which are not in-
<div n="lb">frequent in Pali. The wild variety of spellings in Pali
<div n="lb">itself shows that it early became an obscure word in the
<div n="lb">tradition. BHS occurrences of the spelling aniñjya include
<div n="lb">SP 161.10; Mvy 554, Śikṣ 237.1 (and 223.3, 4 in the ms.);
<div n="lb">perhaps Mv i.133.13 (Senart āniñjya, em., mss. mostly
<div n="lb">anīca [{%not low?%}], one aniṃca, perhaps intending aniñj[y]a);
<div n="lb">either an- or ān- (uncertain because of saṃdhi) Mv i.228.11,
<div n="lb">15; 229.6; ii.132.15 (here v.l. °nijya-). For examples of
<div n="lb">the other spellings see s.vv. There seems to be no difference
[Page024-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">in mg. between the various spellings; any of them may
<div n="lb">be an adj., {%immobile, immovable%}, or a nt. n., {%immovability%}.

<div n="lb">(Pali -ppatta) and -bhūta, above; apparently primarily
<div n="lb">adj. as third of a triad, the first two members of which
<div n="lb">are puṇya and apuṇya, or kuśala and akuśala; all three
<div n="lb">are applied to {%deeds%} (karman), or the {%performance%} or

<div n="lb">to which such various acts lead as fruit. The first two,
<div n="lb">meritorious and demeritorious, relate to good and bad
<div n="lb">deeds as leading to rebirth in the kāmāvacara and (only
<div n="lb">good deeds) in the rūpāvacara states, or to these resulting
<div n="lb">states; the word aniñj(y)a, aneñj(y)a, or ā°, refers to
<div n="lb">deeds leading to rebirth in the arūpāvacara states, or
<div n="lb">to those states themselves (the dhyāna states), cf. Bbh
