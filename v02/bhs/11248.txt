{@bhit(t)vara@}¦, adj., {%ruined, broken-down%}: (of a house,)
<div n="lb">read bhitvara (with ms. Ḱ) or °ru (with 3 mss., KN)
<div n="lb">in SP 85.4 (vs), for durbalam of both edd., which the
<div n="lb">preceding and parallel sudurbalaṃ makes improbable;
<div n="lb">Tib. ḥjig (ñe) supports a form of bhid-; read for the next
<div n="lb">word bhairavaṃ, with all Nep. mss. of KN, also Ḱ,
<div n="lb">and Tib. ḥjigs, for KN's em. itvara; this word (q.v.) is
<div n="lb">inappropriate here, yet similar enough in mg. to have
<div n="lb">helped in the creation of bhit(t)vara, as if bhid- plus
<div n="lb">tvara, modelled on i-tvara and Skt. ga-tvara; the latter
<div n="lb">has a mg. virtually identical with that required here.
<div n="lb">Is this the word intended by vidvarena (vi = bhi repea-
<div n="lb">tedly here) in Dutreuil, C fragm. XIIIvo, for which Pali
<div n="lb">SN i.131.11 has bhindanena, v.l. °rena? See Barua and
<div n="lb">Mitra 211, 213.
