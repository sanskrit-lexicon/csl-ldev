{@-chana@}¦ for -channa (Skt.), {%covered%}, in (text) duccha-
<div n="lb">naṃ and succhanaṃ, yathā hy agāraṃ du° Ud xxxi.11--16
<div n="lb">and…su° 17--22; meter favors, indeed almost demands,
<div n="lb">channaṃ, which is read in the same vss in Pali, Dhp. 13,
<div n="lb">14, and must, it seems, be adopted here, tho the manifold
<div n="lb">repetition of this obvious error is strange.
