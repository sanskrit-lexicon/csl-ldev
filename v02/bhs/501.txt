<div n="lb">'dhyāśayaty anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau Śikṣ 17.21.
<div n="lb">In LV 18.8 the good ms. A reads adhyāśayati for text
<div n="lb">°sayati (mahāpṛthivīṃ…abhinirjityādhyāsayati), {%is firm-%}

<div n="lb">right; Skt. adhyāste is used in this sense, and the LV
<div n="lb">form is only an aya extension of this; the meaning and
<div n="lb">construction do not fit adhyāśayati.
