{@āgraha@}¦ (presumably m.; cf. {@āgṛhīta@}), {%niggardliness,%}
<div n="lb">{%holding back%} (from giving): SP 257.1 (after long description
<div n="lb">of how the Bodhisattva gave away everything, even his
<div n="lb">life) na ca me kadācid āgrahacittam utpannam, {%and I%}
<div n="lb">{%never conceived a thought of holding back%} (wrongly Burnouf
<div n="lb">and Kern); Av i.174.5 (vs; after 4 nādattvā paribhuñjīran
<div n="lb">na syur matsariṇas tathā,) na caiṣām āgrahe cittam utpa-
<div n="lb">dyeta kadācana, {%and there would never arise for them a%}
<div n="lb">{%thought of holding back%} (from giving). As Speyer points
<div n="lb">out in his Index to Av, KSS 90.22 probably contains the
<div n="lb">word āgraheṇa {%with niggardliness, holding back from giving%};
<div n="lb">but this mg. has not been recognized; the ordinary Skt.
<div n="lb">usage is not quite the same.
