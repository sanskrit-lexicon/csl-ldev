({@vaṃśarāga@}¦, {%bamboo-colored%}, adj. applied to a kind
<div n="lb">of vaiḍūrya-gem in Kauṭ. Arth., Shama-S.^1 76.19; so also
<div n="lb">Jm 92.2 vaṃśarāga-vaiḍūrya-prabhā-vyatikara-harita-sali-
<div n="lb">lam; in line 4 (vs) the same is described as marakata-
<div n="lb">harita-prabhair jalair…, which misled Speyer into taking
<div n="lb">va° as a synonym of marakata, {%emerald%}; but it is clear
<div n="lb">from Kauṭ. that it is another green gem.)
