{@asya@}¦, also {@sya@}, apparently particle of emphasis; acc.
<div n="lb">to Senart on Mv i.45.1, = Skt. svid, Pali su (also assu).
<div n="lb">(Note that PTSD s.v. su^3 derives this not only from Skt.
<div n="lb">svid but also from Skt. sma, for which it there states
<div n="lb">that Pali also has sa and assa; but neither of these forms
<div n="lb">is cited in their proper places in PTSD; Andersen, Reader,
<div n="lb">Glossary s.v. sudaṃ, also mentions sa and assa as occur-
<div n="lb">ring for Skt. sma but does not list them; PTSD s.v. assu
<div n="lb">cites once assa as v.l. for assu; otherwise I have no record
<div n="lb">of Pali (as)sa as a particle.) In mss. of Mv anya or anyaṃ
<div n="lb">is sometimes read for asya: evam asya syāt Mv i.45.1, 5,
<div n="lb">9, 12; kim asya nāma i.343.4; tasya sya dharmā i.292.1;
<div n="lb">kiṃ sya nāma, and kena sya nāma, i.346.8 and 9, 15 and
<div n="lb">16; 347.3.
