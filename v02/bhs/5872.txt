{@Gopā@}¦ (also {@Gopī@} and {@Gopikā@}, qq.v.; in Pali a Sākiya
<div n="lb">girl named Gopī or Gopikā is known, but not identified
<div n="lb">with the Bodhisattva's wife), n. of a Śākya girl, who in
<div n="lb">LV and Suv becomes the wife of the Bodhisattva (in most
<div n="lb">other texts he marries {@Yaśodharā@}, q.v.): LV 142.8 ff.
<div n="lb">(daughter of {@Daṇḍapāṇi@}); 157.4 ff.; 194.7 ff.; 230.3 ff.;
<div n="lb">237.19; Suv 200.8; in Mvy 1071 Gopī or Gopā, named next
<div n="lb">to Yaśodharā, but there is no reason to assume their
<div n="lb">identification (Mironov reads Gopā without v.l.); in Gv
<div n="lb">385.6 ff. Gopā occurs as a Śākya-kanyā, who in 420.19
<div n="lb">is the daughter of {@Daṇḍapāṇi@} (like the Gopā of LV), but
<div n="lb">there is here no suggestion that she married the Bodhisat-
<div n="lb">tva, tho she mentions him 419.20 (as well as {@Vairocana@},
<div n="lb">396.23).
