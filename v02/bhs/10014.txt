{@pratipadā@}¦ = prec. (as in Pali paṭipadā), but very
<div n="lb">much rarer; hence, where saṃdhi is ambiguous, I have
<div n="lb">assigned the doubtful forms to {@pratipad:@} dharmadeśanā-
<div n="lb">pratipadā-saṃpannaṃ…śāstāraṃ Mv iii.201.9, {%perfected%}
<div n="lb">{%in the practice of preaching the law%}; ye sarvatragāminīprati-
<div n="lb">padāṃ tatratatragāminīpratipadāṃ…prajānanti 320.14,
<div n="lb">in list of the ten {@bala@} of a Tathāgata, see pratipad, towards
<div n="lb">the end; nirvāṇagāminī °dā 201.15, 18; madhyamā °dā
<div n="lb">331.8, 10, between the two extremes, introducing Four
<div n="lb">Noble Truths; in 12 the word mārga is omitted, text
<div n="lb">reading yad idam āryāṣṭāṅgikā, sayyathīdaṃ samyag-
<div n="lb">dṛṣṭiḥ etc.; but one ms. reads āryāṣṭāṅgikaḥ, implying
<div n="lb">mārgaḥ as in all known parallels, and the adaptation to
<div n="lb">the fem. gender of pratipad in one ms. (followed by Senart)
<div n="lb">is prob. an error, resulting from the accidental omission
<div n="lb">of the noun mārgaḥ; below the usual formulas are found,
<div n="lb">duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad-āryasatyaṃ 331.18; tatra
<div n="lb">katamā (mss. °mo!) duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad
<div n="lb">āryasatyā (! so mss. and Senart), eṣaiva āryāṣṭāṅgo mārgo,
<div n="lb">etc., 332.9-10.
