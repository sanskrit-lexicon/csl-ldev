{@? viruta@}¦, ppp.-adj., in LV 337.15 (vs) seems to mean
<div n="lb">{%surpassing%}; so Tib. ḥdas pa (normally = Skt. ati-kram-):
<div n="lb">śakyo nāhaṃ tvatsādṛśyair bahubhir api gaṇana-virutair
<div n="lb">(no v.l.) drumāt praticālituṃ, {%I cannot be made to retreat%}
<div n="lb">{%from the Tree%} (of enlightenment) {%even by many such as%}
<div n="lb">{%you%} (Māra), {%surpassing count%}. The word seems surely
<div n="lb">corrupt but I have not thought of a good em.; ti-(for ati-)
<div n="lb">might be read for vi-, but what -ruta represents escapes
<div n="lb">me; perh. -gata? Foucaux, Notes 182, cites a v.l. viratai.
