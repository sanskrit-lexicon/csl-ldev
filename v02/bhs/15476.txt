{@saṃspṛśati@}¦ (cf. Pkt. saṃphusiya, {%wiped away%},
<div n="lb">clearly ppp. to this verb, altho it is not otherwise recorded
<div n="lb">in this mg. and Sheth derives the Pkt. from saṃmṛṣṭa,
<div n="lb">implausibly), {%wipes away, removes (?)%}, or perh. (as in Skt.)
<div n="lb">{%comes in contact with%}, or (BR s.v. 6) {%masters, gets the better%}
<div n="lb">{%of%}: mitreṣu (6 putreṣu) ādīnavaṃ (read °va, with mss. in
<div n="lb">6, both times) saṃspṛśanto eko care khaḍgaviṣāṇakalpo
<div n="lb">Mv i.359.2, 6 (vss); so mss., both times, surely to be kept
<div n="lb">(Senart em. saṃmṛśanto, perhaps because of Pali Sn 69
<div n="lb">saṃmasitā; but the two verses are otherwise quite different);
<div n="lb">the preceding, closely parallel vss have vijugupsamāno
<div n="lb">(viji°, tu ju°); translate, {%wiping away (removing)%}, or {%coming%}
<div n="lb">{%in contact with%}, or {%overcoming, the evil%} (that resides) {%in%}
<div n="lb">{%friends (sons), one should…%}; the first seems most likely.
