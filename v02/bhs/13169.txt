{@Vajrapāṇi@}¦ (in Skt. ep. of Indra; in Pali Vajirapāṇi
<div n="lb">is n. of a yakkha, also of Indra, the two being identified,
<div n="lb">at least sometimes; on his character see DPPN; in BHS
<div n="lb">sometimes = Indra, as in Mv i.183.10 where his form is
<div n="lb">assumed by Buddha; prob. also in Gv 250.20, where he
<div n="lb">parallels, and forms the climax of, a series of devatās;
<div n="lb">and prob. SP 445.6), n. of a yakṣa, Māy 3 (living at Rāja-
<div n="lb">gṛha); cf. {@Vajra-rājagṛha@}; usually not, as in Māy, a
<div n="lb">mere local yakṣa, but a much more imposing and even
<div n="lb">terrifying yakṣa, who e.g. in Bbh 152.1 may be conjured
<div n="lb">up by a Bodhisattva to frighten evil-doers (cf. also {@Caṇḍa-@}
<div n="lb">{@vajrapāṇi@}); often called by epithets like mahāyakṣa-
<div n="lb">senāpati Suv 85.3, {@guhyakādhipati@} 91.17 (see the word,
<div n="lb">and cf. LV 66.6), yakṣendra 158.13; similarly Mmk 548.7,
<div n="lb">and often; elsewhere he is an important Bodhisattva, at
<div n="lb">or near the head of lists of them, Kv 1.7; Mvy 649; one
<div n="lb">of eight, Dharmas 12; a special attendant on Buddha
<div n="lb">Laṅk 240.10; a Bodhisattva in the 8th bhūmi is Vajrapāṇi-
<div n="lb">satatānubaddha, Dbh 71.22; other references to V. the
<div n="lb">Bodhisattva, Śikṣ 274.3; Sādh 49.13 etc.; Mmk 11.6;
<div n="lb">62.28; 68.20, etc.; it is clear, however, that for Mmk,
<div n="lb">at least, the Bodhisattva and the yakṣa or guhyaka
<div n="lb">prince are the same person; so Vajrapāṇir bodhisattvo
<div n="lb">25.8 is referred to in 12 as {@(Ā)guhyakādhipatinā@} yak-
<div n="lb">ṣendreṇa; in addressing Vajrapāṇiṃ guhyakādhipatim,
<div n="lb">36.2, he is called {@jinaputra@} (= bodhisattva) in the next
<div n="lb">line; he is called a bodhisattva in 145.2 and 13, and
<div n="lb">addressed as yakṣeśa in 14.
