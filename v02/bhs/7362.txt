{@dukha@}¦ (as in Pali, see Childers), {@dukhin@}, and {@dukhita@},
<div n="lb">m.c. in verses for duḥkha, °khin, °khita, {%misery; miserable%}.
<div n="lb">The mss. and edd. are quite inconsistent, but write dukha
<div n="lb">very often, at least, where meter requires it; so SP 54.10;
<div n="lb">162.2 (in 92.6 ed. dukha-, acc. to note with only one ms.);
<div n="lb">LV 173.11 (no v.l.); 220.22 (dukhī, v.l. duḥ°); in LV
<div n="lb">252.10 Lefm. properly em. dukhitaṃ against all mss.,
<div n="lb">but in 188.12 he allows the equally unmetr. suduḥkhito
<div n="lb">to stand; Senart on Mv i.9.17 keeps duḥkhā of mss.,
<div n="lb">noting that meter implies a short penult; so also i.14.16,
<div n="lb">15.13, and often, usually not em. by Senart; dukha is
<div n="lb">rather common in vss of Samādh, e.g. 19.20; also in Gv,
<div n="lb">dukha 301.22; 488.9; dukhitām 474.23; dukha (v.l. duḥ°)
<div n="lb">Bhad 21; etc. In my opinion dukh° should always be read
<div n="lb">where meter indicates short first syllable.
