{@anudharma@}¦ (= Pali anudhamma). Acc. to PTSD,
<div n="lb">Pali dhammānudhamma is used as a distributive or
<div n="lb">intensive cpd., see under 1 {@anu@}, {%the Law in all its parts%};
<div n="lb">while Childers understands anudh° as {%lesser or inferior%}
<div n="lb">{%dhamma%} (against which see Lévi on Sūtrāl. xiii.1 comm.).
<div n="lb">Acc. to CPD anudhamma means {%(right) method%} and is a
<div n="lb">‘hypostasis of anu-dhammaṃ’ (adv., {%in accordance with%}
<div n="lb">{%dhamma%}). In BHS (as also in Pali, e.g. Dhp. 20) there is
<div n="lb">some evidence suggesting that dharmānudharma is equiv-
<div n="lb">alent to dharmasya anu°, perhaps {%the true method of the%}
<div n="lb">{%law%} or the like: Bbh 284.1 na pratipadyante dharmasyānu-
<div n="lb">dharmam, {%they do not attain (? practise) the anudh° of the%}
<div n="lb">{%dh°%}; 197.16 dharmasyānudharmaṃ pratipadyamānasya
<div n="lb">(sc. Bodhisattvasya; not agreeing with dharmasya, which
<div n="lb">depends on anudh°); Gv 383.5 dharmasya cānudharmaṃ
<div n="lb">pratipadye, {%and I attain (? practise) the anudh° of the dh°%}.
<div n="lb">Without dharma in the context, we find anudharma-cārin
<div n="lb">Divy 617.16 (°riṇī, f.), anudharma-praticārin Mvy 1123
<div n="lb">(°rī). So we should probably interpret all cpds. of dhar-
<div n="lb">mānudharma-, which usually parallel the like cpds. in
<div n="lb">Pali: dharmānudharma-cārin Dbh 32.21; °rma-pratipatti,
<div n="lb">{%attainment (? practice) of the anudh° of the dh°%} Mvy 1801
<div n="lb">(mss. erroneously omit dharma after anu; em. Kyoto
<div n="lb">ed.); Dbh 33.29; Bbh 204.7; KP 9.2; LV 32.16; °rma-
<div n="lb">pratipanna Bbh 84.4; LV 179.12; 377.14; Mvy 1124.
<div n="lb">In Mvy 9321 are mentioned ṣaḍ anudharmāḥ, after 9320
<div n="lb">ṣaḍ dharmāḥ; so also Bhīk 16b.4 ṣaṭsu dharmeṣu ṣaṭsv
<div n="lb">anudharmeṣu śikṣā; in neither place do I find any clue to
<div n="lb">what the six anudharma (or dharma) are. I have not noted
<div n="lb">any adv. anudharmaṃ (parallel to Pali anudhammaṃ).
