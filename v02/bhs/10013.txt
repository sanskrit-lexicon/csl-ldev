<div n="lb">{%conduct, practice, behavior%}, esp. {%good, approved behavior%},
<div n="lb">= {@pratipatti@}, q.v.; acc. to Childers and PTSD, so also
<div n="lb">primarily Pali paṭipadā; this mg. is recognized by Speyer
<div n="lb">on Av ii.130.2, which he reads by em. araṇya-°daṃ
<div n="lb">samādāya (better, I think araṇāṃ pra°, see s.v. {@araṇya@};
<div n="lb">in that case render {%passionless way of behavior%}); he also
<div n="lb">accepts this mg. in puṇyāṃ pratipadam udbhāvayan
<div n="lb">dānadamasaṃyamādibhiḥ Jm 100.10, {%displaying meritorious%}
<div n="lb">{%behavior by…%}; vākpragraheṇa pratipanmayena Jm 105.2,

<div n="lb">them into practice; (anayāpi…caryayānayāpi) pratipadā
<div n="lb">LV 263.11 (pratipad = caryā), and similarly 264.18;
<div n="lb">often rendered {%way, path%}, and called ‘a quasi-synonym
<div n="lb">of magga’ in PTSD; this is due to the fact that the {%middle%}
<div n="lb">{%course of conduct%}, madhyamā pratipad(ā), is (in BHS as
<div n="lb">in Pali) identified with the eight-fold way (mārga) stated
<div n="lb">in the fourth Noble Truth, but the terms are quite differ-
<div n="lb">ently defined, ma° pra° being the course of {%behavior%} which
<div n="lb">steers between the two extremes (anta) of violent asceticism
<div n="lb">and worldliness; the lack of real synonymity between Pali
<div n="lb">magga and paṭipadā is shown, e.g., by DN ii.154.25-26
<div n="lb">(kaṅkhā vā vimati vā) Buddhe vā dhamme vā saṃghe vā
<div n="lb">magge vā paṭipadāya vā (obviously different things must
<div n="lb">be meant); madhyamayaiva pratipadā LV 416.21 (con-
<div n="lb">trasted with amadhyamā pratipad = violent asceticism,
<div n="lb">416.19); here as elsewhere such a statement introduces
<div n="lb">the Four Noble Truths, the fourth of which is duḥkhaniro-
<div n="lb">dhagāminī pratipad (with or without āryasatyam, in LV
<div n="lb">417.3, 12 without it, in 12 = eṣa evāryāṣṭāṅgamārgaḥ);
<div n="lb">so Mvy 1314, 1319, 1324; Mv ii.138.5 (with āryasatyam)
<div n="lb">and 10 (without it); 285.4 (without it); SP 179.3 (with it);
