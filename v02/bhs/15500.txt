<div n="lb">ayaṃ…(same words), masinā-d-ayaṃ…, sukhumā-d-
<div n="lb">ayaṃ…, tanukā-d-ayaṃ…, etc., Mv iii.53.17; this proves
<div n="lb">that the usual interpretation, {%friendly%}, cannot be right;
<div n="lb">it is of course based on the assumption of derivation from
<div n="lb">sakhi, but this is proved wrong by the Mv passage; other-

<div n="lb">and mudu = mṛdu; sakhilo glossed muduvacano DN
<div n="lb">comm. i.287.3 ff., and all comms. agree essentially on this,
<div n="lb">as well as on sākhalya, sākhalla (= {@sākhilya@}), which is
<div n="lb">the opposite of pharusa(-vācā etc.), e.g. Dhs. 1343; DN

<div n="lb">{@akhila@} = paruṣa, {%harsh%} (of speech), suggests interpretation
