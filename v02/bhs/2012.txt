{@alpāsvāda@}¦, adj. (subst. ? = Pali appassāda), {%affording%}
<div n="lb">{%little pleasure%}, in Mv i.121.4 perhaps subst., a sort of
<div n="lb">kenning for kāma (the Pali word is often an epithet of
<div n="lb">kāma, and sometimes seems to be a substitute for it).
<div n="lb">The Mv line (vs) is corrupt; perhaps alpāsvāda-nibaddho
<div n="lb">(or read °dhā?) means kāma-nibaddho; in the second
<div n="lb">half line surely lokā vartenti dāruṇāḥ is intended, rather
<div n="lb">than Senart's em.; as adj., e.g. Divy 41.26 (mahāsamudro)
<div n="lb">'lpāsvādo bahvādīnavas.
