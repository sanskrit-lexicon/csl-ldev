{@lokadhātu@}¦, m. and f. (= Pali id., only f. acc. to
<div n="lb">Childers; see s.v. {@dhātu@}, 5), {%world-region, world-system,%}
<div n="lb">{%world%}; extremely common everywhere: three sorts,
<div n="lb">{@sāhasracūḍika, dvisāhasra, trisāhasramahāsāhasra@}
<div n="lb">(qq.v.; under the last, many examples showing both
<div n="lb">genders for lokadhātu are cited) Mvy 3041--4; other Mvy
<div n="lb">cases (all m. when unambiguous), 226, 361, 816, 860, 3046,
<div n="lb">3060, 3063, 3070; besides the forms with trisāhasrama-
<div n="lb">hāsāhasra, both m. and f. forms occur, the mss. frequently
<div n="lb">varying; in SP 40.16 KN with 3 mss. m., 3 others f., ed.
<div n="lb">note says f. ‘seems preferable, dhātu being usually of
<div n="lb">fem. gender in SP’, but this is hardly borne out by the
<div n="lb">evidence of this edition; e.g. it is clearly m. in 156.7
<div n="lb">(prose, no v.l.); 157.1 (one ms. f.); 306.10; in 41.10 and 42.1
<div n="lb">(parallel 40.16 above) ed. with all mss. but one masc.;
<div n="lb">in 121.11 ff. ed. prints fem. forms, but Kashgar rec. masc.,
<div n="lb">usually with some Nep. mss.
