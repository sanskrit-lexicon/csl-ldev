{@? oṣita@}¦, in RP 19.10 (vs) apy oṣitā āmiṣapātracīvare
<div n="lb">(so apparently divide), {%set upon, intent upon worldly things%}
<div n="lb">(like) {%bowl and robe%} (see {@āmiṣa@}). Cf. Pali an-osita, {%not%}
<div n="lb">{%occupied%} (of houses; CPD). If correct, oṣita seems = Skt.
<div n="lb">avasita; used with loc. But api at the beginning is sus-
<div n="lb">picious, and s does not normally become ṣ after MIndic
<div n="lb">o for ava. I suspect corruption.
