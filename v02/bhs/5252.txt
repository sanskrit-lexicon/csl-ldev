{@kovidāra@}¦, m. (in Skt. n. of a tree, and also, in Hariv.,
of a heavenly tree, equated by BR with pārijāta; same
two mgs. belong to Pali koviḷāra), in Mv i.32.4 and ii.452.1,
at least, n. of one of the groves of the Trāyastriṃśa gods;
elsewhere it is regularly equated or associated with pāri-
jāta(ka), which seems as a rule to have its Skt. mg., or
{@pāriyātra(ka)@}, q.v.; cf. DPPN ‘The pāricchattaka
(= pārijātaka, °yātraka; called a tree, but 100 leagues
in circumference) is generally described as a koviḷāra’;
it is certainly sometimes a (heavenly) tree, e.g. Gv 193.9
pārijātaka-kovidāra-sadṛśān (vṛkṣān), but at other times
it is hard to be sure whether it is conceived as a tree or
a grove; e.g. Mvy 4199 (after pāriyātraḥ 4198, which is
preceded by names of groves, but with 4200 ff. come words
for individual trees); Divy 219.20 pāriyātrako (mss.) nāma
kovidāro, 27 pārijātako kovidāro; SP 360.13--14 pārijā-
takasya kovidārasya, and same Av ii.89.6 (°jātasya);
Gv 501.11 (here pāriyātrakasya). Perhaps the explanation
is that, like the Pali pāricchattaka, it was a single tree
of such size as to be equivalent to a grove.
