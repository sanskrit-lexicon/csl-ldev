{@kovidāra@}¦, m. (in Skt. n. of a tree, and also, in Hariv.,
<div n="lb">of a heavenly tree, equated by BR with pārijāta; same
<div n="lb">two mgs. belong to Pali koviḷāra), in Mv i.32.4 and ii.452.1,
<div n="lb">at least, n. of one of the groves of the Trāyastriṃśa gods;
<div n="lb">elsewhere it is regularly equated or associated with pāri-
<div n="lb">jāta(ka), which seems as a rule to have its Skt. mg., or
<div n="lb">{@pāriyātra(ka)@}, q.v.; cf. DPPN ‘The pāricchattaka
<div n="lb">(= pārijātaka, °yātraka; called a tree, but 100 leagues
<div n="lb">in circumference) is generally described as a koviḷāra’;
<div n="lb">it is certainly sometimes a (heavenly) tree, e.g. Gv 193.9
<div n="lb">pārijātaka-kovidāra-sadṛśān (vṛkṣān), but at other times
<div n="lb">it is hard to be sure whether it is conceived as a tree or
<div n="lb">a grove; e.g. Mvy 4199 (after pāriyātraḥ 4198, which is
<div n="lb">preceded by names of groves, but with 4200 ff. come words
<div n="lb">for individual trees); Divy 219.20 pāriyātrako (mss.) nāma
<div n="lb">kovidāro, 27 pārijātako kovidāro; SP 360.13--14 pārijā-
<div n="lb">takasya kovidārasya, and same Av ii.89.6 (°jātasya);
<div n="lb">Gv 501.11 (here pāriyātrakasya). Perhaps the explanation
<div n="lb">is that, like the Pali pāricchattaka, it was a single tree
<div n="lb">of such size as to be equivalent to a grove.
