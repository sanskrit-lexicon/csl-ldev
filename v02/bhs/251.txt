[{@añja (añjas?)@}¦, cf. Skt. añjas, {%quickly%}; exclamation
<div n="lb">used in Pali (Jāt. i.192.5, 29) in urging a draft-animal to go
<div n="lb">{%(gee! get up! go ahead!), come up!%} In LV 394.18 (vs) tad
<div n="lb">añja is Lefm.'s em. for tad-anya of all mss. and Calc.
<div n="lb">which seems to make no sense. Addressed by Brahmā to
<div n="lb">the Buddha, urging him to preach the law; presumed to
<div n="lb">mean perhaps {%come on!%} But Tib. seems to have had a
<div n="lb">quite different reading: kha ḥbyed pa, {%mouth open%} (Fou-
<div n="lb">caux, {%ouvre ta bouche%}; but the form is not given as impv.
<div n="lb">by Jä). Should we read {@ud-añca@}, 2 sg. impv., for Skt.
<div n="lb">ud-añcaya, {%ertönen lassen%} (pw)? Graphic confusion of {%u%}
<div n="lb">and {%ta%} occurs in some Indian alphabets, e.g. in Śāradā.]
