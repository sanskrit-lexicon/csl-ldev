{@Kṣemā, (1)@}¦ (= Pali Khemā) n. of Śākyamuni's
<div n="lb">chief female disciple: Mv i.251.21 (agrā…śrāvikā); ({@2@})
<div n="lb">n. of a daughter of King Prasenajit, who also became a
<div n="lb">nun in the Buddha's order: Av ii.46.7 ff.; in 50.9 she is,
<div n="lb">in fact, declared by Buddha to be agrā me…bhikṣu-
<div n="lb">ṇīnāṃ mama śrāvikāṇāṃ, so that she is actually identified
<div n="lb">with (1); her story, however (Av no. 79) is wholly different
<div n="lb">from the story of Khemā in Pali. (Mv gives no story
<div n="lb">about Kṣemā 1.).
