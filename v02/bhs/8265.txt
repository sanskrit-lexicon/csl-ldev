{@nipaka, (1)@}¦ m., {%chief%} (cf. Jain Skt. nipa, doubtless
<div n="lb">semi-Skt. for AMg. ṇiva = Skt. nṛpa, Ind. Stud. 14.386):
<div n="lb">Divy 447.27; 451.20; ({@2@}) adj., = Pali id., in Pali tradition
<div n="lb">app. always interpreted as {%wise, prudent%}, and so nepakka,
<div n="lb">{%wisdom, prudence%}; occurs in Ud several times, mostly in
<div n="lb">vss which also occur in Pali with the same word, viz.
<div n="lb">vi.8; xii.18; xiv.13, 14; xv.6 (here text nṛpaka, not cor-
<div n="lb">rected in ed.; if genuine, could only be hyper-Sktism;
<div n="lb">the Pali vs, It. 47.3, has nipako); in all these occurrences
<div n="lb">{%zealous%} (see 3 below) would make quite as good sense;
<div n="lb">({@3@}) in phrase nipakasyāṅgasaṃbhāraiḥ Mvy 7023 and
<div n="lb">Bbh 145.23, {%with the collection of parts of the nipaka%} (man)?
<div n="lb">Acc. to Tib. on Mvy, ḥgru skyaṅ, {%zealously attending (?),%}
<div n="lb">{%zealous%}, and so Chin. on Mvy appears to take nipaka;
<div n="lb">Wogihara's Index to Bbh renders it by two Chin. characters
<div n="lb">which may mean {%constantly self-possessed%} (possibly associat-
<div n="lb">ing the word with Pali niya, niyaka, = Skt. nija, {%own?%}).
<div n="lb">It would be possible to identify this occurrence of the
<div n="lb">word with mg. 2; it might mean {%prudent, wise%}, here; or
<div n="lb">contrariwise the occurrences under 2 might mean {%zealous%}.
<div n="lb">Further complication is caused by {@niyaka@}, which Tib.
<div n="lb">seems to interpret as the same as nipaka, suggesting
<div n="lb">graphic confusion; this is proposed in the Index to Mvy
<div n="lb">and in pw 7.352, where niyaka is assumed to stand for
<div n="lb">nipaka and the mg. {%wise%} is given for both Mvy passages,
<div n="lb">but doubtfully for the one here under discussion.
