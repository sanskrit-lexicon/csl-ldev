{@dvādaśavargīya@}¦, f. {@°yā@}, pl., {%belonging to a group of%}
<div n="lb">{%twelve%} (nuns; clearly not {%heretics%} as stated in Index):
<div n="lb">°yābhiḥ śrutam Divy 493.12; °yābhir 495.23. No such
<div n="lb">group has been discovered in Pali; the context in Divy
<div n="lb">is my only source of knowledge of the meaning. It can
<div n="lb">hardly mean {%members of the dvādaśavarga%}, q.v., in the sense
<div n="lb">of {%quorum for ordination%}. Apparently these nuns were
<div n="lb">given to cavilling and trouble-making; they object to
<div n="lb">functions assigned to (Cūḍa-)Panthaka.
