{@prasavāyitā@}¦ (so mss.; could be denom. ppp. to Skt.
<div n="lb">prasava), {%delivered%} (of a child): tayā ({%by her%}, the mid-
<div n="lb">wife) sā °tā Divy 484.8 (ed. em. prasavāpitā, ppp. of
<div n="lb">MIndic caus. to Skt. prasavati, {%bears%}); the reading of
<div n="lb">the mss., and my interpretation, seem supported by the
<div n="lb">close parallel tayā {@prasavitā@} 485.12, {%by her she was%}
<div n="lb">{%delivered%}, where the form in °tā can at any rate not be
<div n="lb">caus., and seems likely to be denom. from prasava (rather
<div n="lb">than a MIndic ppp. to prasavati, = Skt. prasūtā).
