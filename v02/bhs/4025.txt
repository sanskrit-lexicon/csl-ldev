{@Ṛṣipatana@}¦ (in mss. also {@°paṭana, °paṭṭana, °pattana,@}
{@°bhavana@}), or {@Ṛṣivadana@}, nt. or (LV) m., n. of the
deer-park at Benares where Buddha preached his first
sermon. On the forms of the name, see Senart, Mv i.631;
Lévi, JA 1912 (vol. 20), 499 f.; Pali Isipatana; this form
supported by widely-known etym., Mv i.359.17 ṛṣayo
'tra patitā ṛṣipatanaṃ, similarly LV 19.3, and in Pali;
vadana acc. to Senart and Lévi Prakritic. Both forms
Mvy 4130 °patanam, Tib. lhuṅ ba, {%fall%}, and 4131 °vadanam,
Tib. smra ba, {%speak%} (Mironov °pattanam for the latter,
but he records v.l. °padanam; Tib. supports °vad°). In
Mv, mss. usually vary between -vadana and -pattana,
Senart always (in these cases) adopting the former:
i.43.15 (one ms. °bhavana); 161.4; 174.2; 307.5; 313.16,
19; 323.14, 16 (in 16 -pahana instead of -pattana); 330.4;
331.3; 337.11; iii.330.3, 17. But in i.243.3 Senarts reads
bhavanasmiṃ with mss. (v.l. °nesmiṃ), and (besides
i.359.17 above) in ii.138.2; iii.323.3; 328.20 -patana (only
v.l. -pattana in all three); in i.366.8 mss. °paṭṭane, Senart
pattano. Divy has only -vadana, 393.21; 464.16; Av only
patana, i.42.9 etc., passim (in i.237.13 the former Buddha
Kāśyapa stays there). SP has -patana, once, 69.12; and
LV app. only -patana, 18.20; 19.3; 264.22; 402.3; 404.17;
407.16; 413.1; 421.16 (v.l. -paṭana 18.20; 19.3); in 407.16
nom. sg. °no (the only form in LV unambiguous as to
gender).
