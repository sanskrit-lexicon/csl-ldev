<div n="lb">bar ḥgyur, {%experiences severally%} (cf. 7281 vedayati = Tib.
<div n="lb">myoṅ bar ḥgyur), but it is doubtful whether prati should
<div n="lb">ever be rendered {%severally%} in this cpd.; a possible case is
<div n="lb">sukhaṃ duḥkhaṃ °vati Karmav 56.21 and 57.3, where
<div n="lb">for 56.21 Lévi says {%éprouve respectivement%}, but in the
<div n="lb">close parallel 57.2 anubhūtam is used, without prati; on
<div n="lb">the other hand, in many cases the word refers definitely
<div n="lb">to what is experienced as a result af past deeds, so that
<div n="lb">one is inclined to render prati {%in return, as recompense%};
<div n="lb">so in Karmav above, and in: (paśyantu…aniṣṭaṃ)
