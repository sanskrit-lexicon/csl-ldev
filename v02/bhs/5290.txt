{@Kraku(c)chanda, (1)@}¦ (= Pali Kakusaṃdha), also
written Krakutsanda (Mv i.2.6; v.l. ii.302.22; v.l. iii.246.9;
iii.330.6; Gv 297.26; 441.15; Mmk 68.27; 426.9); Kakuc-
chanda, v.l. Kakutsanda, Karmav 65.7 and 76.14; in Mvy
90 Krakucchanda, 91 also Kakutsunda (but Mironov
only the former, with v.l. °tsanda, reporting that 1 ms.
adds and then deletes Krakutsunda); the Tib. translation
is regularly ḥkhor ba ḥjig, {%destroyer of the saṃsāra%}, which
is given in Mvy 91, while 90 strangely gives log pa daṅ sel
(which I have found nowhere else and cannot interpret)
for Krakucchanda: n. of a former Buddha, almost in-
variably the third before Śākyamuni in the standard series
(but in Mv iii.231.3 a much earlier Buddha in a long list
which later contains at 240.8 the same name in his regular
position); as such most commonly named with {@Kanaka-@}
{@muni@} (or equivalent form, see this) and {@Kāśyapa@}, the
two Buddhas intervening between Kra° and Śākyamuni;
in Mv i.2.6 Kanakamuni is omitted, prob. by accident of
tradition; sporadically the order is varied; the three
together named (often with others in list) in Mvy 90--93;
Dharmas 6; Mv i.294.19--20; 318.13, 18; ii.265.9, 11, 14;

15; 283.17 (here meter requires krā°; all mss. °chanda,
n. sg., Lefm. em. °chandu for no apparent reason); Divy
333.5--6; Mmk 68.27; 397.12, 13; 426.8, 9; Gv 206.11--12;
