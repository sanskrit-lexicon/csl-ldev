{@-prāpta@}¦, ppp. (= Skt. id., Pali -patta), in āścarya-,
<div n="lb">adbhuta-pr° generally means {%filled with astonishment and%}
<div n="lb">{%wonder%} (e.g. SP 188.5). But in SP 183.4--5 āścaryaprāptā
<div n="lb">…adbhutaprāptā ime ṣoḍaśa śrāmaṇerāḥ, rather, some-
<div n="lb">thing like {%arrived at a wonderful thing or condition, marvel-%}
<div n="lb">{%ously successful%}. In KP 9.5 and 10.5 dāntājāneya-prāpta
<div n="lb">(bodhisattva), and KP 9.14; 10.17, 20 ājanya-prāpta
<div n="lb">(bodhisattva), clearly {%arrived at (the condition of being…)%}
<div n="lb">i.e. {%become (tamed) noble%} ({%steeds%}, see {@ājanya, ājāneya@}).
<div n="lb">In most of these, Tib. renders prāpta by thob pa, which
<div n="lb">acc. to Jä. primarily means {%get, attain%}, but in expressions
<div n="lb">like saṅs rgyas thob pa {%become%} (lit. {%get%}) {%a Buddha%}. This
<div n="lb">latter seems clearly parallel to the use of -prāpta in these
<div n="lb">KP passages. Ordinarily a cpd. ending in -prāpta has as
<div n="lb">its prior member an abstract noun. Note however that
<div n="lb">some such prior members may be either abstract or con-
<div n="lb">crete; thus adbhuta may mean either {%surprising%} or {%sur-%}
<div n="lb">{%prise%}. Possibly the KP usage arose by analogy of such
<div n="lb">compounds. There are other cpds. of prāpta with a pre-
<div n="lb">ceding adj.; see s.v. {@niṣkāṅkṣa@}.
