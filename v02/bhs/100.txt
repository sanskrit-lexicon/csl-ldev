{@agasti-harītakī@}¦, a kind of plant or tree: Mvy 5781;
<div n="lb">Tib. a-gas (partial transliteration). In Mironov agasti and
<div n="lb">harītakī are presented as separate items, perhaps cor-
<div n="lb">rectly; {@agasti@} is recorded as n. of a plant or tree in Skt.
<div n="lb">But the Kyōtō ed. interprets {@Agasti-@} in the cpd. as the
<div n="lb">ṛṣi-name.
