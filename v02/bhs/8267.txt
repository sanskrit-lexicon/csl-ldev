[{@nipathī@}¦, LV 372.3 (vs), seems uninterpretable and
<div n="lb">has very little ms. support; v.l. (a)narthī, which is metric-
<div n="lb">ally and semantically good (see citation s.v. {@granthita@}),
<div n="lb">{%disadvantageous%}, and seems implied by Foucaux's transl.;
<div n="lb">Tib. omitted in Foucaux but the mg. attributed to Tib.
<div n="lb">in his Note (193) to transl. of the BHS LV accords well
<div n="lb">with anarthī.]
