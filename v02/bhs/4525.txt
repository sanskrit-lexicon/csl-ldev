{@? karṇikāyā@}¦, in °yā-keyūrāṇi (in a list of various
<div n="lb">ornaments, all noms.) LV 121.7 (prose; printed as cpd. by
<div n="lb">Lefm.). One ms. (A) omits karṇikāyā; another reads
<div n="lb">°kāyāṃ (loc. of °kā); Calc. karṇikāḥ; Weller 25 states that
<div n="lb">his ms. reads karṇābharaṇāni muṇḍikābharaṇāni (for
<div n="lb">karṇikāyā-keyūrāṇi? or for the two preceding words? his
<div n="lb">statement is not clear). Some form or equivalent of kar-
<div n="lb">ṇikā, {%ear-ornament%}, is doubtless meant. Tib. {%ear-ornaments%}
<div n="lb">(rna rgyan) {%and shoulder-ornaments%} (the latter represents
<div n="lb">keyūrāṇi).
