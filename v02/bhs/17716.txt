{@hirodaka@}¦ (not ahiro°!), Divy 384.24, acc. to Note
<div n="lb">p. 709 hirā-udaka, {%vein-water, blood%}: but this is quite im-
<div n="lb">plausible. The phrase is hirodakasikatāpiṇḍair aṇḍakāṣṭhe-
<div n="lb">bhyo (see this) 'pi asārataratvaṃ kāyasyāvetya, {%realizing%}
<div n="lb">{%that the body is more worthless even than eggshells(?) full%}

<div n="lb">{%gravel%}. (Burnouf, {%pleines de boules de sable faites avec des%}
[Page620-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">{%larmes de serpent%}.) The instr. -piṇḍair is apparently asso-
<div n="lb">ciative, with the following word; perhaps render {%eggshells%}
<div n="lb">{%along with lumps%} etc., {%eggshells%} (if Burnouf is right) being
<div n="lb">likewise symbolic of worthlessness, and also fragility. In
<div n="lb">Deśīn. 8.66 is noted hilā, {%sand%} (vālukā); hirā is prob.
<div n="lb">equivalent to this. It would fit with sikatā, and udaka
<div n="lb">could perhaps be used as a symbol of worthlessness.
