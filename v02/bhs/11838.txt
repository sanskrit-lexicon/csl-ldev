{@mahārāja(n)@}¦, (= Pali id.), ({@1@}) {%one of the four guardians%}
<div n="lb">{%of the cardinal directions%}, corresponding to Skt. lokapāla,
<div n="lb">and called by this name Dharmas 7, MSV i.255.17, and
<div n="lb">Mvy 3145 as sometimes in Pali, but usually mahārāja(n)
<div n="lb">in both Pali and BHS: catvāro (°raś ca) mahārājāno or
<div n="lb">°rājā LV 202.13; 366.11; Divy 218.9; Av i.67.10; ii.104.2,
<div n="lb">12; instr. Mv i.230.12; often, as in some of the above,
<div n="lb">included in lists of other gods; mahārāja-sthānam SP
<div n="lb">264.12, {%the position of world-guardian%}, as one of five states
[Page425-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">which a woman cannot attain. Pali and BHS differ from
<div n="lb">Skt. in the names assigned to the four individuals, except
<div n="lb">that Kuvera (Kubera), oftener called Vaiśravaṇa (Pali
<div n="lb">Vessavaṇa), sometimes Dhanada or other synonyms, is
<div n="lb">the guardian of the north, as usually in Skt. The other
<div n="lb">three (in Skt. normally Indra, Yama, and Varuṇa) are
<div n="lb">{@Dhṛtarāṣṭra@} (east), {@Virūḍhaka@} (rarely Virūḍha; south),
<div n="lb">and {@Virūpākṣa@} (west; Pali Dhataraṭṭha, Virūḷha(ka), and
<div n="lb">Virūpakkha). These four are named, Dharmas 7 (as loka-
<div n="lb">pāla); Mvy 3146--9 (as prec., lokapālaḥ 3145); SP 4.6--7;
<div n="lb">LV 217.16, 20; 218.4, 9; Suv 64.2--3; LV 382.19 ff. (names
<div n="lb">384.6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 21; 385.3); LV 388.3, 389.1, 21,
<div n="lb">390.19 = Mv iii.306.9, 307.13, 308.13, 309.13; Mmk 654.21;
<div n="lb">the four are mentioned as devādhipatayaḥ among the
<div n="lb">kāmāvacara gods whom Māra perceives as favoring the
<div n="lb">Bodhisattva, LV 302.5--6; and elsewhere in lists of other
<div n="lb">gods, e.g. Mv i.245.8--9 where Vaiśravaṇa is separated in
<div n="lb">the list of gods from the other three; sometimes not all
<div n="lb">are named, thus only Virūḍhaka, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Kubera
<div n="lb">(with other gods) Mmk 434.27--435.1; only Vaiśravaṇa
<div n="lb">and Virūḍhaka, both styled mahārājo, SP 398.8, 399.5;
<div n="lb">only Virūḍhaka Mv iii.72.3 (mahārājo), and 84.1, 6; Indro
<div n="lb">Virūḍhakādyāś ca (-ādya including the other three?)
<div n="lb">Laṅk 367.14; in some of the above the fact is mentioned
<div n="lb">that Vaiśravaṇa is lord of the yakṣas, Dhṛtarāṣṭra of
<div n="lb">gandharvas, Virūḍhaka of kumbhāṇḍas, and Virūpākṣa
<div n="lb">of nāgas; these functions, rather than their position as
<div n="lb">mahārāja (lokapāla), are exclusively noted in Mvy 3367
<div n="lb">(Vaiśr°, first of yakṣas), 3381 (Dhṛt°, of gandharvas), 3437
<div n="lb">(Virūḍhaka, of kumbhāṇḍas; no similar statement in Mvy
<div n="lb">about Virūp°); and, in longer lists of gods, also in Divy
<div n="lb">126.6--8; 148.18--19; Av i.108.8--9; Gv 249.24--250.2. The
<div n="lb">forms of the names Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Virūpākṣa never vary;
<div n="lb">Virūḍha without final -ka (also recorded in Pali) has been
<div n="lb">noted only Av i.108.9 and Mmk 654.21 (here vs, perhaps
<div n="lb">m.c.); Vaiśravaṇa (see also °ramaṇa) is the regular form,
<div n="lb">for which Kuvera or Kub° is found Dharmas 7; LV 218.9;
<div n="lb">390.19 = Mv iii.309.13; Mmk 435.1; Dhanada Divy 126.8;
<div n="lb">148.19; Av i.108.9; yakṣarāṭ Mmk 654.21 (vs). In MSV
<div n="lb">i.258.2 ff. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Virūḍhaka are said to be
<div n="lb">Aryans (ārya-jātīya), Virūpākṣa and Vaiśravaṇa Dasyus;
<div n="lb">the Buddha resolves to convert them using āryā vāc and
<div n="lb">dasyu-vāc respectively; he then preaches to the first two
<div n="lb">in normal BHS, to the others (259.2, 7) using what appear
<div n="lb">to be meaningless groups of sounds. ({@2@}) n. of a former
<div n="lb">Buddha: °jaḥ Mv i.138.14.
