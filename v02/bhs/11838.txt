<L>11838<pc>425,1<k1>महाराज<k2>महाराज(न्
{@mahārāja(n)@}¦, (= Pali id.), ({@1@}) {%one of the four guardians%}
{%of the cardinal directions%}, corresponding to Skt. lokapāla,
and called by this name Dharmas 7, MSV i.255.17, and
Mvy 3145 as sometimes in Pali, but usually mahārāja(n)
in both Pali and BHS: catvāro (°raś ca) mahārājāno or
°rājā LV 202.13; 366.11; Divy 218.9; Av i.67.10; ii.104.2,
12; instr. Mv i.230.12; often, as in some of the above,
included in lists of other gods; mahārāja-sthānam SP
264.12, {%the position of world-guardian%}, as one of five states
[Page425-b+ 71]
which a woman cannot attain. Pali and BHS differ from
Skt. in the names assigned to the four individuals, except
that Kuvera (Kubera), oftener called Vaiśravaṇa (Pali
Vessavaṇa), sometimes Dhanada or other synonyms, is
the guardian of the north, as usually in Skt. The other
three (in Skt. normally Indra, Yama, and Varuṇa) are
{@Dhṛtarāṣṭra@} (east), {@Virūḍhaka@} (rarely Virūḍha; south),
and {@Virūpākṣa@} (west; Pali Dhataraṭṭha, Virūḷha(ka), and
Virūpakkha). These four are named, Dharmas 7 (as loka-
pāla); Mvy 3146--9 (as prec., lokapālaḥ 3145); SP 4.6--7;
LV 217.16, 20; 218.4, 9; Suv 64.2--3; LV 382.19 ff. (names
384.6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 21; 385.3); LV 388.3, 389.1, 21,
390.19 = Mv iii.306.9, 307.13, 308.13, 309.13; Mmk 654.21;
the four are mentioned as devādhipatayaḥ among the
kāmāvacara gods whom Māra perceives as favoring the
Bodhisattva, LV 302.5--6; and elsewhere in lists of other
gods, e.g. Mv i.245.8--9 where Vaiśravaṇa is separated in
the list of gods from the other three; sometimes not all
are named, thus only Virūḍhaka, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Kubera
(with other gods) Mmk 434.27--435.1; only Vaiśravaṇa
and Virūḍhaka, both styled mahārājo, SP 398.8, 399.5;
only Virūḍhaka Mv iii.72.3 (mahārājo), and 84.1, 6; Indro
Virūḍhakādyāś ca (-ādya including the other three?)
Laṅk 367.14; in some of the above the fact is mentioned
that Vaiśravaṇa is lord of the yakṣas, Dhṛtarāṣṭra of
gandharvas, Virūḍhaka of kumbhāṇḍas, and Virūpākṣa
of nāgas; these functions, rather than their position as
mahārāja (lokapāla), are exclusively noted in Mvy 3367
(Vaiśr°, first of yakṣas), 3381 (Dhṛt°, of gandharvas), 3437
(Virūḍhaka, of kumbhāṇḍas; no similar statement in Mvy
about Virūp°); and, in longer lists of gods, also in Divy
126.6--8; 148.18--19; Av i.108.8--9; Gv 249.24--250.2. The
forms of the names Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Virūpākṣa never vary;
Virūḍha without final -ka (also recorded in Pali) has been
noted only Av i.108.9 and Mmk 654.21 (here vs, perhaps
m.c.); Vaiśravaṇa (see also °ramaṇa) is the regular form,
for which Kuvera or Kub° is found Dharmas 7; LV 218.9;
390.19 = Mv iii.309.13; Mmk 435.1; Dhanada Divy 126.8;
148.19; Av i.108.9; yakṣarāṭ Mmk 654.21 (vs). In MSV
i.258.2 ff. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Virūḍhaka are said to be
Aryans (ārya-jātīya), Virūpākṣa and Vaiśravaṇa Dasyus;
the Buddha resolves to convert them using āryā vāc and
dasyu-vāc respectively; he then preaches to the first two
in normal BHS, to the others (259.2, 7) using what appear
to be meaningless groups of sounds. ({@2@}) n. of a former
Buddha: °jaḥ Mv i.138.14.
