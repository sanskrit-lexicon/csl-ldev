{@va (1)@}¦ (= Pali id.; see also {@vā@}), MIndic for Skt. iva,
most commonly in vss, {%as, like%}; often written ca in mss.
of Mv, and em. by Senart; among the cases where mss.
read va (sometimes with v.l. ca) are: dharmaṃ imaṃ
pāṇitala va (v.l. ca) darśaye Mv i.297.14 (vs); others,
iii.5.5 (vs); 14.13 (vs); 78.11 (vs); 110.11 (vs, v.l. ca);
119.12 (vs, v.l. ca); 123.19 (vs, v.l. ca); 290.12 (prose);
384.19 (vs); padumaṃ va vāriṇā SP 313.3 (vs, no v.l.);
gagane va pakṣī Gv 473.15 (vs); others after final -e or
o, SP 26.7; 127.9; 128.13; LV 49.21; 173.6; 188.14; Mv
i.75.6; ii.115.4; Samādh 19.26; Bhad 20; abhramukto va
Ud xvi.5, 7, oldest ms., changed in later mss. to °mukta
iva (unmetr.) or °muktaiva; after -ā, Mv i.203.2 = ii.6.19;
after -ā for -ās, drumā va SP 131.4; after -a for -am, kāṣṭha
va LV 322.8; bhadraṃ va Ud xix.12, oldest ms., later
v.l. bhadram iva (unmetr.); naḍāgāram iva kuñjaraḥ Divy
68.20 = 138.27 (vs), so text, but meter requires °raṃ
va (or °reva?); a few cases where va is Senart's em., but
quite certainly right, are: Mv ii.241.8 (vs; mss. vā or yā;
meter requires va; for iva); in the rest Mv mss. ca, em.
Senart va: Mv ii.38.12 (vs); āmapātraṃ va ambunā 240.11
(vs; same line, āmapātram ivāmbunā LV 263.1); 250.2;
iii.110.10; 123.20; there are many other cases where Senart
reads va for mss. ca, not all certain; ({@2@}) (see also {@vā@})
perhaps for Skt. eva, as in Pali, but the cases noted are
few, and most could be em. to ca (the reverse of ca for
va = iva, just mentioned): kālaṃ (mss. kāla; metr. in-
different) va nātināmenti Mv i.192.14 (vs); (tam rājyenā-
bhiṣiñcatha,) so va rājā bhaviṣyati Mv ii.436.14 (prose),
possibly {%he and no other%} (but prob., with ca, {%and he%}) {%will%}
{%become king%}; (amṛtaṃ) mayā bhikṣavaḥ sākṣātkṛto(!)
'mṛtagāmī va (v.l. ya; Weller 38 ‘Schreibfehler für ca’,
prob. rightly) mārgaḥ LV 409.8 (prose); darśenti dharma-
caryāṃ (meter requires cariyāṃ) va sudharmaniṣṭhāṃ
Gv 477.6 (vs: printed vasudhar°, which is impossible;
va = eva could be assumed); kukṣigatā va Mv i.144.13
(prose), here clearly = eva, {%still in their mothers' wombs%};
viśiṣṭarūpaṃ v' iha SP 90.11 (vs), all mss., could be for
eva; both edd. em. c’ iha; in 91.12 (vs) WT em. va, with
Tib. ñid, for mss. ca (plausibly); ({@3@}) va m.c. for vā (as
in Pali), {%or%}: mañjughoṣu yatha yādṛśo va ham Gv 489.10
(vs), {%like Mañjughoṣa, or such as I%} (Maitreya) {%am%}.
