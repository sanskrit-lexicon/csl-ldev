<div n="lb">(SP 83.11; 85.13); Tib. renders variously, on Mvy 4785
<div n="lb">spyaṅ ({%wolf%}) or ce spyaṅ ({%jackal%}, acc. to Das also {%fox%});

<div n="lb">the word śṛgāla, {%jackal%}, is prob. a different animal, since
<div n="lb">it is closely associated with our word in LV 306.6; SP
<div n="lb">83.11 and 86.12; in LV, where Tib. wa renders our word,
<div n="lb">śṛgāla is rendered by ce spyaṅ, while in the two SP passages
<div n="lb">the reverse is the case, wa rendering śṛgāla! Kern on SP
<div n="lb">renders {%hyena%}, a plausible guess. Forms: bheraṇḍa Mv
