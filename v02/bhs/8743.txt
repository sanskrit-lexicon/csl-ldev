{@Pakṣu@}¦, n. of a nāga king: °ur Mvy 3307. Cf. {@Vakṣu@}.
<div n="lb">Tib. Pag-śu. But it seems to be a river-name; the three
<div n="lb">preceding names are Gaṅgā-, Sindhur, and Sītā-nāgarājā;
<div n="lb">similarly in MSV i.164.1. (Nāgas are often thought of as
<div n="lb">living in rivers, as is well known; cf. Mvy 3304--6.) Since
<div n="lb">Vakṣu occurs as n. of a river in Skt., it is probably the
<div n="lb">correct form.
