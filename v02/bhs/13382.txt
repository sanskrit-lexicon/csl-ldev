[{@vala@}¦, so Lefm with most mss., and Calc. bala, in
<div n="lb">LV 429.22 (prose)-nagnavalānupradāna-, which certainly
<div n="lb">must mean {%giving clothes to the naked%}. Neither bala nor
<div n="lb">vala nor even vara is recorded in any such mg. as {%garment%}
<div n="lb">or {%cloth%}. Two mss. are reported as reading vaila, which
<div n="lb">obviously intends caila; so read with Foucaux (Notes 206).]
