{@kṣudra-pāka@}¦, adj., {%very ripe%}, of fruits in the last
<div n="lb">month of summer: Mv iii.143.(14--)15 (grīṣmāṇāṃ) paścime
<div n="lb">māse kṣudrapākāni phalāni bhuktāni, whereupon he was
<div n="lb">thirsty, drank much cold water, and got indigestion;
<div n="lb">substantially the same, 144.5; 153.10; the mg. seems
<div n="lb">guaranteed by 154.6 where pakva-supakvāni replaces
<div n="lb">kṣudrapākāni, in what is otherwise virtually the same
<div n="lb">phrase. Cf. Skt. svādupāka, defined BR as {%was sich süss,%}
<div n="lb">{%angenehm kocht%}, d. h. {%verdaut%}; {@kṣudra@} here means {%honey-%}
<div n="lb">{%like = sweet%} (see s.v.). In Mv iii.154.14 the ṛṣi who had
<div n="lb">the above adventure squeezes such fruits (so that the
<div n="lb">juice falls) into the mouth of the infant born to the doe
<div n="lb">who drank his seed: ṛṣi kṣudrapākāni phalāni mukhe
<div n="lb">pīḍeti.The interpretation is further confirmed by Mv
<div n="lb">iii.145.2 kṣudra-kṣudrāṇi phalāni (on which see {@kṣudra@}),
<div n="lb">of the fruits fed by the ṛṣi to the young Ekaśṛṅga(ka).
<div n="lb">It seems that the ṛṣi's indigestion was caused by the
<div n="lb">excessive amount of cold water he drank, not by the
<div n="lb">fruits.
