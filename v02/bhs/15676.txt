{@satpuruṣa@}¦ (cf. Skt. id., Pali sappurisa), lit. {%worthy%}
<div n="lb">or {%true man%}: Mvy 7358; sixteen s° listed SP 3.10, the chief
<div n="lb">being Bhadrapāla, who is the only one named in RP 2.3,
<div n="lb">where 16 are also referred to. They are evidently a lay
<div n="lb">category, and are mentioned immediately after a list of
<div n="lb">Bodhisattvas. According to Professor Paul Mus (oral com-
<div n="lb">munication, May, 1949), they are a kind of lay equivalent
<div n="lb">of the Bodhisattvas, who live the life of gṛhapatis; Prof.
<div n="lb">Mus finds a typical illustration of them in the figure of
<div n="lb">{@Vimalakīrti@} (q.v.), so well known in Chinese Buddhism.
<div n="lb">In BHS, V. is not listed so far as I know except once in
<div n="lb">a list of 16 Bodhisattvas. The term satpuruṣa may include
<div n="lb">monks: Mv i.37.4 (see s.v. {@labhā, labhyaṃ@}).
