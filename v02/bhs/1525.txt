({@abhinirvṛtta@}¦, ppp. Skt., also Pali °nibbatta; cf.
<div n="lb">{@°vartaka, °vartana, an-abhi°@}; {%come into being%}: to be
<div n="lb">read with ed. Divy 71.6 (mahānyagrodhavṛkṣo) 'bhi°
<div n="lb">(most mss. °vṛtaḥ), and with Senart's note on Mv i.168.7
<div n="lb">°vṛttaṃ dharmaṃ deśenti nāyakāḥ. Senart does not
<div n="lb">indicate that this is an em., altho both his text and the
<div n="lb">crit. app. read °vṛtaṃ; this however seems uninterpretable
<div n="lb">in the context. Senart understands {%attained to%} (repeated)
<div n="lb">{%existence%} (with different Buddhas). Cf. under {@abhinivar-@}
<div n="lb">{@tate@}.)
