{@a-kisara-lābhin@}¦, adj., and {@°bhi-tā@}, abstr.; also in
<div n="lb">Skt. form as {@a-kṛcchra°@}, {%(state of) obtaining without%}
<div n="lb">{%difficulty%}: akṛcchra-lābhī (n. sg.) Mvy 2432 = dkaḥ pa
<div n="lb">med par thob pa, and akisara-l° 2433 = tshegs med par°,
<div n="lb">or, ṅan ṅon ma yin par°; akṛcchrākisaralābhi-tā Bbh
<div n="lb">388.13 = (acc. to note) Tib. ṅan ṅon ma yin par thob pa
<div n="lb">daṅ tshegs med par thob pa. The three Tib. translations
<div n="lb">are synonymous; it is striking that both the MIndic and
<div n="lb">the Sktized forms are recorded together in both Mvy and
<div n="lb">Bbh. Pali has both akasiralābhi(n) and akiccha°; other-
<div n="lb">wise the cpd. is not recorded. Even akṛcchra is not recorded
<div n="lb">in Skt. except for akṛcchra-laṅghya in pw 5.240 (from
<div n="lb">Rājat.; perhaps due to Buddhist influence?). See {@kisara@};
<div n="lb">it appears that in Pali, too, kasira and kiccha, both histori-
<div n="lb">cally from kṛcchra, came to be understood as different
<div n="lb">words. This suggests that BHS a-kṛcchra-lābhin may be a
<div n="lb">Sktization of an older MIndic a-kiccha° (= Pali and Pkt.
<div n="lb">id.), specifically, and not of BHS {@kisara@}, which maintained
<div n="lb">an independent existence for a time, tho ultimately it was
<div n="lb">crowded out by the Sktized kṛcchra.
