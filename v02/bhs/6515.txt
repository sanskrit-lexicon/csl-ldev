<div n="lb">text LV 175.4 (vs) tatha ojaharo ahu vyādhi jaro; so
<div n="lb">all mss. acc. to Lefm.; but citation Śikṣ 206.2 has jage
<div n="lb">for jaro, and is supported by Tib. ḥgro baḥi (in transl.
<div n="lb">of LV); jage is surely right; jaro is carried over from
<div n="lb">174.16--175.2 where jarā occurs repeatedly. Tib. on LV
<div n="lb">also supports Śikṣ ayu instead of LV text ahu, reading
<div n="lb">ḥdi.]
