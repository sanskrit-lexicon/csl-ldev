<div n="lb">the two seem to be confused, at least if the Pali Dictt.

<div n="lb">meaning {%discouragement, mental trouble%} (as in {@a-parita-@}
<div n="lb">{@syana@} etc., cf. {@paritasyati, °tras°@}) would be possible in
<div n="lb">the above AsP passage, and could also be the meaning
<div n="lb">of {@utkaṇṭhā@}, as in Pali ukkaṇṭhā and BHS {@utkaṇṭhati@};
<div n="lb">the disappearance of the vision could lead to {%depression%}
<div n="lb">of mind, as well as to {%eager desire%} to see it again.
