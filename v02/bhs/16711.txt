({@sāṃparāya@}¦, m., or nt., = Skt. id. = BHS and Pali
<div n="lb">{@saṃparāya@}, q.v. The definition in BR is not happy;
<div n="lb">{%future life%} or {%state%} is the mg. in Skt. The Sktized form
<div n="lb">occurs in BHS, e.g. Ud v.25 sāṃparāye, in contrast with
<div n="lb">dṛṣṭe dharme; and in Mv iii.214.17; 218.6; 222.9; in these
<div n="lb">gamanīyo (or °yaṃ) sāṃparāyaḥ (or °yaṃ, as if nt.) is
<div n="lb">read instead of {@saṃparāyaḥ@}, q.v., which occurs in the
<div n="lb">same phrase near by. See also {@saṃparāyika@} and next.)
