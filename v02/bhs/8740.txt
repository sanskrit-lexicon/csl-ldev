[{@pakṣati:@}¦ °nti in LV 88.15, if correct could only be
<div n="lb">a denom. from pakṣa, {%party%}; cf. Dhātup. pakṣa(ya)ti =
<div n="lb">parigrahe; with object pratipakṣaṃ, {%adhere to the opposite%}
<div n="lb">{%party%}. But several mss. vakṣanti, which could intend
<div n="lb">vakṣyanti, as read by Calc., and this seems supported by
<div n="lb">Tib. brjod pa, {%speak%}; prob. therefore read so.]
