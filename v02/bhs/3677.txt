{@upadeśeti (°śayati)@}¦, {%exhibits, displays%}: Mv i.169.16
<div n="lb">jarāṃ ca upadeśenti, na caiṣāṃ vidyate jarā; and
<div n="lb">19, ārabdham (? mss. alabdhi) upadeśenti eṣā lokānu-
<div n="lb">vartanā (see {@anuvartanā@}). Similarly 170.2 (they are not
<div n="lb">born or begotten, yet) mātāpitṛñ ca deśenti eṣā lokānu-
<div n="lb">vartanā; 170.10 alpotsukatvaṃ pradeśenti eṣā°. The mg.
<div n="lb">is regular for Skt. deśayati and for upadiśati, pradiśati,
<div n="lb">but not recorded for the causatives of the two latter.
<div n="lb">Nevertheless it seems necessary to keep the mss. readings,
<div n="lb">rather than read (upa-, pra-)darśenti, as Senart in his
<div n="lb">note was tempted to do (and that altho forms of darśayati
<div n="lb">are similarly used in the context, e.g. 170.4, 6).
