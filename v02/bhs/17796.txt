{@hoti@}¦ (= Pali id.), for Skt. bhavati, see Chap. 43, s.v.
<div n="lb">bhū (2). The pres. hoti is rare compared to bhoti; on the
<div n="lb">other hand, in futures of the hohiti (hohati) type, ho- is
<div n="lb">much commoner than bho-; and it is doubtful whether
<div n="lb">bhoṣyati (instead of bheṣyati) should be recognized at
<div n="lb">all as fut.
