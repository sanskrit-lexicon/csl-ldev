<div n="lb">paṃsayati.The AMg. ukkosa is derived by Sheth and
<div n="lb">Ratnach. from utkarṣa (or utkṛṣṭa) and defined as adj.,
<div n="lb">{%highest, supreme%}, or, as n., {%pride%}. If this is the true etym.,
<div n="lb">our word would be a hyper-Sktism, by false etym. Possibly,
<div n="lb">however, the AMg. word may really represent a Skt.
<div n="lb">*utkrośa, which, like Eng. {%a crying-up%}, could conceivably
<div n="lb">have meant {%glorification%}. To be sure I find no record,
<div n="lb">otherwise, of such a mg. in any deriv. of ut-kruś.
