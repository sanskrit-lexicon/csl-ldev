{@utkṣepa-lipi@}¦, n. of a kind of script: LV 126.5; fol-
<div n="lb">lowed by {@nikṣepa°, vikṣepa°@}, and (6) {@prakṣepa-lipi@};
<div n="lb">also, line 7, utkṣepāvarta-lipi, and (in some mss., supported
<div n="lb">by Tib.) nikṣepāvarta-lipi.All these terms seem to be
<div n="lb">intended to refer to the shape of the letters, rather than
<div n="lb">to the countries where they are used. It is hardly possible
<div n="lb">to guess what the author meant by them, and the woodenly
<div n="lb">literal Tib. translations give little help; Tib. renders
<div n="lb">utkṣepa, gdeg pa, {%elevation%} (and āvarta, skor ba, {%turn%});
<div n="lb">nikṣepa, bzhag pa or bzhog pa, {%putting down%}; vikṣepa
<div n="lb">(which Tib. transposes to the point in line 6 where Lefm.'s
[Page122-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">ms. A has it), rnam ḥthor, {%scattering%}; prakṣepa, bsnan pa,
<div n="lb">{%addition, increase%}.
