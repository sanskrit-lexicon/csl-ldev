{@samanvagībhūta@}¦ (mss. of Mv), {@samanvaṅgībhūta@}
<div n="lb">(other texts), {%provided%} (with), {%enjoying%} (instr.): only (except
<div n="lb">two vv.ll. in Mv) in cliché pañcabhiḥ kāmaguṇāiḥ, or in
<div n="lb">Mv pañca(hi) kāmaguṇehi, samarpita(ḥ, etc.) °bhūta(ḥ,
<div n="lb">etc.), foll. by krīḍati ramati paricārayati, or other forms
<div n="lb">of these or equivalent verbs; = {@samaṅgībhūta@}, q.v.,
<div n="lb">Pali samaṅgi°; on the Mv passages see samaṅgī°, which
<div n="lb">Senart always reads: samanvaṅgī° Mvy 7374; Divy
<div n="lb">219.22 ff.; Śikṣ 166.8; AsP 488.11; MSV i.113.2. There
[Page564-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">seems no doubt that samaṅgī°, or °gi° (as app. always
<div n="lb">in Pali without v.l.), is the orig. form. In most Mv occur-
<div n="lb">rences, some or all mss. read samanvagī° or °gi°; this
<div n="lb">may well have been the first change, and have actually
<div n="lb">existed in the language; it will have been analyzed as
<div n="lb">based on an adj. *sam-anvaga, equivalent to Pali anvaga
<div n="lb">(also anvagata), for anuga(ta), with intrusive -a- by anal.
<div n="lb">of augmented verb forms, see CPD; no doubt the common
<div n="lb">synonym {@samanvāgata@} also helped in this creation. This
<div n="lb">was later modified to samanvaṅgī° (found in a single
<div n="lb">ms. at Mv i.31.6), the only BHS form outside of Mv (in
<div n="lb">five texts); it was doubtless analyzed as sam-anv-aṅgī°,
<div n="lb">cf. Skt. aṅgīkaroti and derivs., as well as {@sam-aṅgin@}.
