{@duṣṭhula@}¦, adj. (also spelled {@°ṣṭū°@}; = Pali duṭṭhulla,
<div n="lb">adj. and n.; cf. {@dauṣṭhulya@}; on etym see below), {%wicked,%}
<div n="lb">{%grievously evil%}: °lām āpattim Prāt 504.1 (Chin. {%une faute%}
<div n="lb">{%grave%}); MSV iii.79.5 (see {@atisārin@}), duṣṭūlāpattiḥ, a-duṣṭu°
<div n="lb">Hoernle, MR 12.5 (in a Vinaya fragment), rendered {%grave%}
<div n="lb">{%offense, not…%}; in Mvy 8424 °lārocana, 8473 °la-prati-
[Page268-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">cchādana, Mironov °lāprati°, {%telling%} and {%(not) concealing%}
<div n="lb">{%what is wicked%} (no neg. in Tib. and Chin.), the word could
<div n="lb">(but need not) be considered equal to dauṣṭhulya; °la-
<div n="lb">samudācārāḥ, {%of wicked behavior%}, MSV ii.200.17 (of the
<div n="lb">{@ṣaḍvargika@} monks). In Prāt 479.12 duṣṭhulayā vācā
<div n="lb">(cf. Pali Vin. iii.128.22) could be rendered {%with lewd words%}
<div n="lb">(making sexual advances to a woman), which acc. to
<div n="lb">Childers and PTSD is a special (tho not the exclusive)
<div n="lb">mg. of Pali duṭṭhulla; since no other BHS occurrence of
<div n="lb">this word or dauṣṭhulya suggests this mg., it seems more
<div n="lb">probable that the standard meaning, {%gravely evil%}, prevails
<div n="lb">here too. Derivation from Skt. Gr. duṣṭhu (pendant to
<div n="lb">Skt. suṣṭhu) has been plausibly suggested by Lévi, Sūtrāl.
<div n="lb">vi.2 note 3, and others. Prob. Pali -ulla shows the older
<div n="lb">form of the ending: on the Pkt. suffix -ulla cf. Pischel
<div n="lb">595. Probably dauṣṭhulya was first constructed as a hyper-
<div n="lb">Skt. form from duṭṭhulla; it was restricted to substantive
<div n="lb">use, and duṣṭhula (which seems to have been much rarer)
<div n="lb">was a back-formation from it, as adj. Leumann, cited by
<div n="lb">Wogihara, Lex. 27 f., came fairly close to this suggestion
<div n="lb">as an alternative (his first proposal seems to me implau-
<div n="lb">sible).
