{@? bhaṅgakula@}¦, Mv ii.251.6, in a list of enemies of
<div n="lb">birds, all gen. pl., after sākuntikānām (śā°), cāṇḍālakānām
<div n="lb">(mss. ca°), mṛgalubdhakānām, biḍālakroṣṭukānām, and
<div n="lb">nakulānām, comes (in text) bhaṅgakulānām (but mss.
<div n="lb">both °kulān; one ms. bhaṅgeṇa--so, ṇ!--for bhaṅga-).
<div n="lb">Senart thinks of muṅgusa-kulānām (Pali Lex. muṅgusa,
<div n="lb">{%mongoose%}, Childers); closer to the mss. would be AMg.
<div n="lb">maṅgusa, id. As Senart notes, this would seem to duplicate
<div n="lb">nakulānām, the preceding term. Possibly, however,
<div n="lb">maṅgusānām may have been the orig. reading, the last
<div n="lb">part corrupted by confusion with nakula. It might,
<div n="lb">possibly, have designated a different species of {%mongoose%}
<div n="lb">from nakula, which would justify the collocation of the
<div n="lb">two words.
