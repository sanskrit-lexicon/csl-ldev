{@-pāsa(ka)@}¦, f. {@-ikā@}, ifc. (Pali sūci-pāsa, Vism. 284.14),
<div n="lb">{%eye (of a needle)%}, in {@vaṭṭa-p°@}, q.v., Mv ii.87.17; text
<div n="lb">°yāsikā; same vs in Pali, Jāt. iii.282.13, su-pāsiyaṃ (v.l.
<div n="lb">°kaṃ), acc. sg. with sūciṃ; comm. sundarena suviddhena
<div n="lb">pāsena samannāgatattā supāsiyaṃ (suggesting that -iya
<div n="lb">or -ka, -ikā, accompanies the Bhvr. cpd. only); and, in
<div n="lb">fact, pāse (loc.) occurs in the prose iii.282.3, 5, with
<div n="lb">vijjhi(tvā), where the translators render wrongly {%dice%};
<div n="lb">rather, {%piercing%} (the needle) {%at the%} (place for the) {%eye%}.
<div n="lb">From Skt. pāśa, {%loop ?%} A Deśī word (Deśīn. 6.75) pāsa =
<div n="lb">akṣi, {%eye%}, is recorded. Hindi āṅkh, {%eye%}, is given the meaning
<div n="lb">{%hole of a needle%} (sūī kā ched) in Hindī Śabdasāgara (1914),
<div n="lb">1 p. 312, s.v. āṅkh, mg. 4; I have found no confirmation
<div n="lb">of this, or of any use of a word for {%eye%}, of a {%needle's eye%},
<div n="lb">in any Indian dialect, in any other source. The Hindi
<div n="lb">usage (evidently limited) could possibly be explained as
<div n="lb">due to English influence. Professor W.N. Brown informs
<div n="lb">me that the common Hindi word for {%eye of a needle%} is
<div n="lb">nākā. However, Jä. says that Tib. mig, regularly {%eye%},
<div n="lb">also means {%eye of a needle%}, and {%hole for the handle%} of a
<div n="lb">hatchet etc.
