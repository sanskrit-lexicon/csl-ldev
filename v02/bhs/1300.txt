{@a-paritarṣaṇā@}¦ (if neg. to BHS {@paritarṣaṇā@}, q.v.),
<div n="lb">{%not craving%} (so Bendall and Rouse): Śikṣ 183.5 cittasyāna-
<div n="lb">valīnatā 'navamṛdyatā 'paritarṣaṇā. There is no doubt
<div n="lb">that BHS paritarṣaṇā means {%desire%}. But CPD derives
<div n="lb">Pali (a)paritassanā from root tras (while noting that
<div n="lb">comms. derive from tṛṣ), and this seems to get some
<div n="lb">support from the two preceding and parallel nouns in
<div n="lb">Śikṣ; perhaps, then, after all, {%the not being wearied, depres-%}
<div n="lb">{%sed, or anxious%}. Cf. {@paritasyati@}.
