{@jalpa@}¦, m., or better {@jalpā@} (= Pali jappā, {%desire%}),
<div n="lb">{%desire%}: in Mv iii.284.19 (vs) mss. sarvāṃ prahāya bhavalo-
<div n="lb">bhajalpaṃ, not to be emended; same vs in Pali SN i.123.8
<div n="lb">chetvāna (v.l. hitvāna) sabbaṃ bhavalobhajappaṃ. It is
<div n="lb">tempting to interpret in the same way such passages as
<div n="lb">Laṅk 186.8, 9 (vss) jalpaprapañcābhiratā hi bālās…
<div n="lb">jalpo hi traidhātukaduḥkhayonis, {%fools delight in jalpa and%}
<div n="lb">{%idle fancies%} (? see {@prapañca@})…{%for jalpa is the source of%}
<div n="lb">{%the misery of the universe%}. This seems more naturally to
<div n="lb">mean {%desire%} than (idle) {%talk%}; but acc. to Suzuki's Index
<div n="lb">Tib. (smra ba) supports the latter; this might however
<div n="lb">only mean that Tib. knew the regular Skt. jalpa and had
<div n="lb">lost the tradition of the old word represented by Pali
<div n="lb">jappā.
