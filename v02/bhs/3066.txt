{@āsa@}¦, m. (only known in Vedic cpd. sv-āsa-stha), {%seat%}:
<div n="lb">Gv 474.18 (vs) śūrāṇa teṣam ayam āsu (n. sg.) sudur-
<div n="lb">jayānām, {%this is the seat of those heroes…%} Meter does not
<div n="lb">permit emendation to āvāsa, which is used in parallel
<div n="lb">lines 2, 10, etc.; other parallels vihāra; all three are virtual
<div n="lb">synonyms. Prakritic contraction of āvāsa to āsa is im-
<div n="lb">probable. For āsa = aṃśa see {@maitrāsa-tā@}.
