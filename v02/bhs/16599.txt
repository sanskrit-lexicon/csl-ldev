{@sahāya@}¦, in LV 387.9 (vs), if text is right must mean
<div n="lb">{%accompanied%} (by, with instr.): adhunāpy asau tāṃ…
<div n="lb">saṃpūjayaty anyasuraiḥ sahāyaḥ, {%even now he honors it,%}
[Page588-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">{%together with the other gods%}. But this use of sahāya seems
<div n="lb">unparalleled, and Tib. makes it agree with anyasuraiḥ:
<div n="lb">lha gzhan grogs daṅ lhan cig mchod pa byed, {%honors it%}
<div n="lb">{%together with the other companion gods%}; this implies sahāyaiḥ,
<div n="lb">which is prob. the true reading, tho no v.l. is cited. Cf.
<div n="lb">however {@sahīya@}, Buddhac. x.26.
