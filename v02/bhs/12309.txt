{@Maitrīya@}¦, in Kv 2.2 the last of a rather short list
<div n="lb">of Bodhisattvas; we should expect the name of {@Maitreya@}
<div n="lb">(1) here, and probably the text has a mere error or mis-
<div n="lb">print for it. More curious however is Divy 326.9--11 eṣa
<div n="lb">eva devate sa (separate from the next) pṛṣṭhībhūto Mai-
<div n="lb">trīyo yo vyāghryā ātmānaṃ parityajya catvāriṃśatkal-
<div n="lb">pasaṃprasthito Maitreyo bodhisattva ekena śiraḥparityā-
<div n="lb">genāvapṛṣṭhīkṛtaḥ; here, if the text is correct, Maitrīya
<div n="lb">would seem to be the name of Maitreya in an earlier birth;
<div n="lb">but the passage is otherwise puzzling. On the basis of
<div n="lb">these two passages should we recognize Maitrīya as a real
<div n="lb">variant (like {@Maitraka@}, q.v.) for {@Maitreya@} (1)?
