{@adhvānīya@}¦ (better adhvaniya; Pali addhaniya), {%fit%}
<div n="lb">{%for a journey%}: some such form seems clearly intended by
<div n="lb">mss. at Mv iii.93.19; they read (nātyātiśītaṃ nātyātiuṣṇaṃ)
<div n="lb">ṛtusukhaṃ adhvānīyaṃ (v.l. adhyā°) taṃ bhagavantaṃ
<div n="lb">(read bhavantaṃ, or bhadanta, m.c.; object of paśyantu,
<div n="lb">next line, or voc.). They are clearly corrupt, but Senart's
<div n="lb">emendations are proved wrong by the Pali parallel Therag.
<div n="lb">529; divide ṛtu (ṛtuṃ? ṛtū?) sukhaṃ, {%the season is pleasant%}
<div n="lb">{%and fit for travel%}.
