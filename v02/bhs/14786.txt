{@śaṅkhasvara-samācāra@}¦, adj. m. (Pali saṅkassara,
<div n="lb">usually cpd. with samācāra, or sometimes ācāra; sometimes
<div n="lb">the Pali cpd. begins with asuci-; Pali comms., e.g. Pugg.

<div n="lb">Both Mvy 9141 and 9142 seem evident corruptions, and

<div n="lb">The Tib. renderings are prob. also corrupt; at least the
<div n="lb">Tib. Dictt. give no clue to what they might mean. Perhaps
<div n="lb">luṅ (on Mvy 9141), and maybe even lug (on Mvy 9140),
<div n="lb">may be corrupt for duṅ = Skt. śaṅkha, {%shell%}.
