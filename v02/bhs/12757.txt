{@rājanya@}¦, adj. (seems not recorded elsewhere in this
<div n="lb">sense), {%belonging to a king, royal%}: of a park, udyāna, Mv
<div n="lb">ii.112.9, 11; Senart em. {@rājakya@}, q.v.; but he keeps
<div n="lb">rājanyaṃ ii.452.1 (of an āmravanaṃ) and °nyāni kaṇṭhe-
<div n="lb">guṇāni (so mss.) 463.3. In the vicinity of all these passages
<div n="lb">{@rājakya@} occurs; possibly it should always be read (with
<div n="lb">Senart on 112.9, 11).
