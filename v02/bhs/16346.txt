<div n="lb">rightly), in a description of a bhikṣu, {%whenever he draws%}

<div n="lb">Kern 393 f., adopts an earlier suggestion of Kern's and
<div n="lb">derives from sam-vṛj-. He rightly distinguishes this verb
<div n="lb">from Pali sam-iñjati (Dhp. 81, na samiñjanti paṇḍitā),
<div n="lb">{%is moved, is perturbed%}; cf. BHS {@iñjate@}. But when Leumann
<div n="lb">states that this sam-iñjati, in its Pali mg., is also found
<div n="lb">in BHS, I fear that he was speaking carelessly. The only
<div n="lb">cases of sam-iñj- which I have noted are shown by associa-
<div n="lb">tion with forms of prasār- to be false readings for saṃmiñj-;
<div n="lb">such cases also occur in Pali (PTSD). The only ‘confusion’
<div n="lb">shown by BHS in this sept consists in the erroneous
<div n="lb">writing of samiñj- for saṃmiñj- (which Leumann also
<div n="lb">recognizes). Leumann's etym. seems to me at least more
<div n="lb">plausible than any other, including that of Lüders (s.v.
<div n="lb">{@samarjana@}). That double mm (or ṃm), not single m,
<div n="lb">is the only correct form is proved by un-miñj- and ni-
<div n="lb">miñj-, neither of which occurs in Pali; Leumann considers
<div n="lb">them (as he must according to his etymology) secondarily
<div n="lb">abstracted from saṃ-miñj-. I have found no trace of the
<div n="lb">sept elsewhere.
