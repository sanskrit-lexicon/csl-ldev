{@dhūmakālika@}¦ (Pali id., see below; from Pali °kāla,

<div n="lb">{%destruction; destroyed, lost%}: (17--18 tīrthikā…krāyur, so

<div n="lb">{%(Buddha), saying that%} (iti) {%it is perishable (is now going%}
<div n="lb">{%to be destroyed); but this very thing is a state that we must%}

<div n="lb">(vs), {%lest the whole Gospel become destroyed (lost)%}. This, I
<div n="lb">believe, is the mg. of the Pali word too; both the Pali
<div n="lb">comm. and modern interpreters misunderstand it. In Vin.

<div n="lb">{%set of religious teachings was taught by the monk G. to his%}
<div n="lb">{%disciples%}, or in other words, these teachings are perishing,
<div n="lb">or will perish. In Vin. ii.172.15, the only other passage
<div n="lb">recorded, dhūmakālikaṃ pi pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ navakam-
<div n="lb">maṃ denti, {%or they give as new work%} (the reparation of)
<div n="lb">{%a completed monastery that has proved perishable%}, that has
[Page286-b+ 71]
<div n="lb">fallen into ruin, or begun to. The adj. dhūmakālika cannot
<div n="lb">mean, as is supposed, {%lasting to%} (the monk's) {%funeral%}, for
<div n="lb">then it would be synonymous with yāvajīvikaṃ, just
<div n="lb">before it, in line 15; the time expressions vīsativassikaṃ,
<div n="lb">tiṃsavassikaṃ, yāvajīvikaṃ, lines 14--15, all forbidden,
<div n="lb">contrast with lines 26--29 where jobs lasting from 5 or 6
<div n="lb">to 10 or 12 years are permitted, but only upon an akataṃ
<div n="lb">or a vippakataṃ vihāraṃ; it is these latter expressions,
<div n="lb">in line 25, which contrast with the (forbidden) work on
<div n="lb">a dhūmakālikaṃ pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ. It seems that this
<div n="lb">derivative of (Pali) dhūmakāla came to be used figuratively
<div n="lb">in a way fairly remote from its original and literal mg., like
<div n="lb">English {%to go up in smoke = to be destroyed, completely lost%}.
