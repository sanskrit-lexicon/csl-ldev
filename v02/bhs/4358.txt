{@kaṇaya@}¦ or {@kanaya@} (m. or nt.; = Pali id.; on Skt.
<div n="lb">see below), some kind of weapon, said to be a kind of
<div n="lb">{%spear%} or {%lance%}; occurs only in long cpds. consisting of
<div n="lb">lists of weapons of all kinds: -kaṇaya- LV 305.9 (no v.l.);
<div n="lb">306.14 (-kan°, v.l. -kanapa-); 317.15 (several good mss.
<div n="lb">kanaya-); -kanaya- LV 218.12 (no v.l.). The form kaṇaya
<div n="lb">is recorded as v.l. for kaṇapa in some Skt. passages, BR
<div n="lb">2.30, and twice without record of v.l. in late Skt., see
<div n="lb">Schmidt, Nachtr. The form kaṇapa is not very common
<div n="lb">in Skt. itself, see BR l.c. and pw; it is found Mbh.Cr.
<div n="lb">ed. 1.218.24 (Calc. 1.8257) and 3.83* (after 3.21.32 ab;
<div n="lb">Calc. 3.810 kaṇapa, Bomb. kanapa); no Mbh. ms. is recorded
<div n="lb">with ya for pa in either place. Yet it seems probable that
<div n="lb">the variation between y and p is purely graphic; Pali
<div n="lb">and BHS clearly support y, which even Skt. sometimes
<div n="lb">shows as v.l. for p and which may be the original (rela-
<div n="lb">tively very few occurrences are noted).
