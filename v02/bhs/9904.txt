{@-prajñāyate@}¦, denom. from -prajñā, in jāti-prajñāyate
<div n="lb">jarā-pr° vyādhi-pr° maraṇa-pr° LV 19.12 (prose), {%there is%}
<div n="lb">{%knowledge of birth, old age, disease, death%}; based on cpd.
<div n="lb">jāti-prajñā, etc. Weller 18 wrongly assumes that jāti etc.
<div n="lb">are separate nouns, n. sg., and prajñāyate pass.; this is
<div n="lb">the construction in Mv i.52.10 jarā vyādhi maraṇaṃ (so
<div n="lb">mss.; Senart as one dvandva cpd., em. °maraṇā) ca
<div n="lb">prajñāyanti, {%old age, disease, and death become known%}.
<div n="lb">In prose of LV it is hardly conceivable that jāti, vyādhi,
<div n="lb">and maraṇa would occur in one sentence as n. sg.; while
<div n="lb">in prose of Mv vyādhi is not at all surprising as n. sg.
