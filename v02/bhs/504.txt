<L>504<pc>018,1<k1>अध्याहारिणीलिपि<k2>अध्याहारिणी-लिपि
{@adhyāhāriṇī-lipi@}¦, a kind of script: LV 126.9; so
<div n="lb">read for Lefm. madhyā° (after -lipiṃ), allegedly with all
<div n="lb">mss.; Calc. adhyā-, supported by Tib. bla ({%superior%}) thabs
<div n="lb">su bsnan pa ({%? augmentation to a higher means?%}), which
<div n="lb">suggests a form containing adhi; but I do not understand
<div n="lb">the meaning of either the Tib. or the BHS form, unless
<div n="lb">the latter means {%suppletive script%} (a term which might
<div n="lb">conceivably have been applied e.g. to writing of conso-
<div n="lb">nants alone, without vowels).
