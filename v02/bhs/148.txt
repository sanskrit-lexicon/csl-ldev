{@aghaniṣṭha@}¦, doubtless understood as {%sky-based%} (see
<div n="lb">{@agha@}, 1), a class of gods: Mvy 3107, where it follows
<div n="lb">{@akaniṣṭha@}, of which it is surely nothing but a folk-ety-
<div n="lb">mological distortion. So Wogihara, Lex. It occurs in no
<div n="lb">other of my texts unless in Bbh; Wogihara reads so in
<div n="lb">62.6 and 68.5; actually it is read only in the latter place
<div n="lb">by one of the two mss. (which reads aniṣṭha in the former
<div n="lb">place), while the other ms. reads akaniṣṭha both times.
<div n="lb">Wogihara's suggested interpretation, and those he quotes
<div n="lb">from Yaśomitra and Chin., seem to me fantastic and
<div n="lb">worthless. Cf. {@lokaniṣṭha@}.
