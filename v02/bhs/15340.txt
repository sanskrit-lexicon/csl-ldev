<div n="lb">pitte śleṣmike tathā Suv 177.10 (vs), so Nobel. But the
<div n="lb">meter is bad, and I think we should read vātike paittike
<div n="lb">tathā for the 2d pāda, with best ms. except that it reads
<div n="lb">yettike for pai°. Diseases of phlegm were, in the orig.
<div n="lb">reading, mentioned in the 2d pāda of the next line, where,
<div n="lb">contrary to Nobel, I would read with 2 mss., incl. the best,
<div n="lb">kaphavyādhipraśāntaye (v.l. kaphaja-vyā°). The four
<div n="lb">pādas then present the same four topics, and in the same
<div n="lb">order, as in 179.7--10 below.]
