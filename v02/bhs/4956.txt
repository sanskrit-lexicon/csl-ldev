<div n="lb">{%a pillow%} (so BR), ep. of {@Pūrṇa@} (4), q.v.: Divy 44.8; 45.1,
<div n="lb">where he is declared by the Buddha to be the first of
<div n="lb">receivers of food-tickets ({@śalākā@}, 3, q.v.) among his
<div n="lb">disciples. This identifies him with Pali Kuṇḍa-dhāna (see
<div n="lb">DPPN s.v.), a name also applied in DPPN to 1 Puṇṇa;
<div n="lb">Kuṇ° seems to be his regular name, but it is said to have
<div n="lb">been originally Dhāna, and the prefixation of Kuṇḍa-is ex-
<div n="lb">plained in a way which would not fit the BHS epithet.
