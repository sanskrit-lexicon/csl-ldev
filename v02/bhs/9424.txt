{@pārami-, °mī@}¦ (f.; = Pali id., in Pali used both as
in BHS, pāramippatta, °miṃ-gata, Childers, and, usually
in the form pāramī, as equivalent of BHS {@pāramitā@} 2;
BHS seems to use it only once in this latter sense; seems
[Page341-b+ 71]
clearly deriv. in secondary -a, fem. -ī, from parama),
{%mastery, supremacy%}; usually in vss; in LV 414.19 (vs)
read ṣaḍi pārami te, {%the six supremacies%} (= {@pāramitā@} 2)
{%are thine%} (see § 19.24); otherwise noted by me only in
forms °mi-, °mī-, and (with -gata) most commonly °miṃ-,
in comp. with following -gata or -prāpta (edd. often print
the cpd. as two words), {%arrived at, attained to mastery%},
often in comp. with preceding word stating the field of
mastery, but also used absolutely, aham atra °mī-prāpto
SP 35.6 (vs; so ed. with Kashgar rec.; Nep. mss. pāramitā-,
cpd. with foll. nirdiṣṭaḥ); or with gen. or loc. preceding;
pāramiṃgata SP 451.5 (vs, ṛddhībala-); 453.2 (vs, svara-
maṇḍala-), 5 (vs, sarvaguṇa-); LV 28.6 (vs, iṣvastraśiṣyeṣu
ca); 398.19 (vs, āryadharmeṣv iha); Divy 637.5 (vs,
printed as prose; mantrāṇāṃ); Mv i.47.4 (vs, vaśi-, q.v.);
74.4 (vs, ṛddhipādabala-); 129.6 (vs, śastre hi, so divide),
{%for I have attained supremacy in weapons%} (even beyond
you, see {@ati-r-iva@}); 164.11 (vs, cittasthititve asi); 166.9
(vs, śreṣṭheṣu dharmeṣu; 3 mss. unmetr. °mi-gato; the
other three °miṃ-gato; Senart em. °mī-gato, why ?);
169.18 (vs, puṇyeṣu); Gv 488.22 (vs, sarvabuddhaguṇa-);
the preceding nouns are only rarely those included in the
lists of {@pāramitā@} (2), but such occur with °miṃgata Mv
ii.368.2 (vs, kṣāntiye); RP 5.16 (vs, prajñ' upāya sada);
°mi-gata RP 13.11 (vs, dhyāne vīryaguṇe ca); in the
last, and in the foll. cases, it seems likely that the short
i is m.c.: mi-gata LV 110.7 (vs, vararūpa-, read as cpd.);
Mv i.215.4 and ii.18.1 (vs, rūpa-, in 18.1 read anurūpa-);
ii.33.16 (vs, devaguṇa-); iii.355.12 (vs, cittacarita-); but
before prāpta I have found °mī-prāpta only in the doubtful
passage SP 35.6, above; no certain case of °miṃ-prāpta
(cf. Mv i.226.9 below); and otherwise only °mi-prāpta,
once in prose, Mv i.237.12 (uttamadamaśamatha-); and
in vss (note that the syllable °mi- may be metrically either
long, as in Pali °mippatta, or short!), LV 437.12 (vineya-);
Śikṣ 324.20; Mv i.115.7 (vaiśāradyavara-); 152.11 =
226.5 = ii.29.8 (lakṣaṇa- or °ṇa-guṇa-; mss. always °mi-,
but the syllable is long in the last two cases, short in the
first); i.152.15 = 226.9 (here mss. °miṃ-prāp°! but °mi
in the others; syllable is long) = ii.29.12 (lakṣaṇaguṇa-).
