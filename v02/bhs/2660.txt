[{@ātmabhāvatā@}¦, Senart's em. Mv ii.301.11 (prose)
<div n="lb">sarvatra bodhisattvasya °tām anuprāptāṃ saṃjānanti;
<div n="lb">should mean {%embodiment%}, from ātmabhāva plus -tā. But
<div n="lb">the occasion is the approach to his enlightenment (not
<div n="lb">his conception or birth), which is signalized by miracles
<div n="lb">and cosmic portents. The mss. read °bhāvanām, which is
<div n="lb">doubtless right: {%they recognize on all sides that the Bodhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%sattva's self-realization%} (ātma-bhāvanā) {%is at hand%}.]
