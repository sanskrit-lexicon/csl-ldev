{@Nārada, (1)@}¦ occurs as the n. of the well-known sage,
<div n="lb">as in Skt., e.g. Mv iii.401.9; ({@2@}) in Mv ii.55.3; 63.18
<div n="lb">given as n. of the ascetic {@Kauśika@} (1), q.v., owing to a
<div n="lb">confusion of tradition (in Pali, which has the original form
<div n="lb">of the story, he is the same as Skt. Nārada and not =
<div n="lb">Kosika, Kosiya); ({@3@}) in Mv ii.42.19 and 43.2 (here v.l.
<div n="lb">nālada) the name seems to replace {@Nālaka@}, q.v., perhaps
<div n="lb">by corruption of tradition (but cf. the form Nālada in
<div n="lb">Av, also v.l. at Mv ii.43.2).
