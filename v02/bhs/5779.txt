{@guṇāvaguṇṭhita-bhūta@}¦, adj. (see below for Pali),
<div n="lb">LV 205.11, {%entangled in%} (or {%like; a maze or tangle of%}) {%cords%}
<div n="lb">{%(threads)%}. Corresp. to Mvy 5391 {@guḍā-guñjika-bhūta@},
<div n="lb">q.v., = Tib. dru gu ({%ball%} or {%skein of thread%}) ḥdziṅs pa
<div n="lb">({%implicatus, embrouillé%}, Dict. Fr. Cath. Miss.) lta bu,
<div n="lb">{%become as it were mixed up in a skein of thread%}. Parts of
<div n="lb">this old cliché in Mvy 5390--93 and in LV l.c., and re-
<div n="lb">peatedly in Pali, see PTSD s.v. guḷā, which misinterprets;
<div n="lb">an approximation to the Tib. transl. of this word (with
<div n="lb">jāta for bhuta) is given in Pali comms., e.g. DN comm.
<div n="lb">ii.495.24 ff. LV: aho vatāhaṃ…lokasya tantrākulajā-
<div n="lb">tasya (q.v.; so mss.) guṇāvaguṇṭhitabhūtasyā- (here Mvy
<div n="lb">adds {@muñja-balbajajāta@}, q.v., with Pali) -javaṃjava-
<div n="lb">samāpannasyāsamāt etc. (for the rest see s.v. {@ājavaṃ-@}
<div n="lb">{@java@}; Pali lacks this part, at least in most occurrences).
<div n="lb">The tradition, both Pali and BHS, is confused on the
<div n="lb">form of this word, but there seems no doubt of the es-
<div n="lb">sential meaning, as stated above. Instead of guṇa, {%thread%},
<div n="lb">Mvy has guḍā, {%ball%} (sc. {%of thread%}; both Tib. dru gu and
<div n="lb">Pali comms. prove this mg., against PTSD). In Pali the
<div n="lb">mss. in different occurrences show guḷā, guḷi, guṇa, kulā,
[Page213-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">kula, etc.; I suspect the orig. may have been guḍā (Pali
<div n="lb">guḷā), as in Mvy, but note the Pali v.l. guṇa as in LV;
<div n="lb">the mg. of the two is practically identical here. The
<div n="lb">second member appears in Pali as guṇṭhita, guṇṭhika,
<div n="lb">guṇḍika, guṇika, gaṇṭhita, gandhika, etc.; in LV ava-
<div n="lb">guṇṭhita, in Mvy guñjika which seems to be unparalleled
<div n="lb">and uninterpretable. The orig. was most likely guṇṭhita;
<div n="lb">but possibly guṇṭhika (Pali, prob. based on a MIndic
<div n="lb">guṇṭhiya, really = guṇṭhita), or guṇḍita (AMg. guṇḍia,
<div n="lb">°ya).
