{@saṃgraha-vastu@}¦, nt. (= Pali saṃgahavatthu),
<div n="lb">{%article of attraction%}, means by which a Buddha or (more
<div n="lb">often in BHS) a Bodhisattva {%attracts%}, draws to himself
<div n="lb">and to religious life, creatures. The literal mg. has been
<div n="lb">much disputed; it seems to me clarified by LV 429.13
<div n="lb">where reference is made to the Buddha's {%cleverness in%}
<div n="lb">{%drawing-in creatures%} (sattvasaṃgrahakauśalyaṃ) {%by the net%}
<div n="lb">(-jālena) {%of the 4 saṃgrahavastu%}; with this cf. Gv 495.20,
<div n="lb">cited s.v. {@saṃgraha@}. As in Pali, there are four of these:
<div n="lb">dāna, {@priya-vacana@} (or the like), {@artha-caryā@} (or
<div n="lb">{@-kriyā@}), and {@samānārthatā@} (or {@samānasukhaduḥkhatā@}),
<div n="lb">qq.v.; they are listed LV 38.16--17; 160.6--7; 182.6;

<div n="lb">term saṃgraha-vastu); Mvy 924--928; Dharmas 19; Bbh
