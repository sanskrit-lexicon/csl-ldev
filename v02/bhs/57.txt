{@akṣaṇa@}¦, m. or nt. (= Pali akkhaṇa), {%inopportune birth,%}
<div n="lb">{%birth under such circumstances that one cannot learn from%}
<div n="lb">{%a Buddha%}. There are eight such in Pali, DN iii.287.12 ff.;
<div n="lb">AN iv. 225.19 ff. (9 in DN iii.263.31 ff.), viz.: (at a time when
<div n="lb">a Buddha is living) one is born (1) in a hell, (2) as an
<div n="lb">animal, (3) as a preta, (4) as one of the ‘long-lived gods’,
<div n="lb">(5) in border countries or barbarian regions, (6) with
<div n="lb">perverted, heretical mentality, (7) dull, stupid, incapable
<div n="lb">of distinguishing the gospel from what is inconsistent with
<div n="lb">it; or (8) he is born capable of profiting from the gospel
<div n="lb">but at a time when no Buddha exists to teach it. (DN
<div n="lb">iii.263 ff. adds as 9th, after No. 3, birth as an asura.)
<div n="lb">These same 8, transposing 6 and 7, are briefly listed Mvy
<div n="lb">2299--2306: (1) narakāḥ, (2) tiryañcaḥ, (3) pretāḥ, (4)
<div n="lb">dīrghāyuṣo devāḥ, (5) pratyantajanapadam, (6) indriyavai-
<div n="lb">kalyam, (7) mithyādarśanam, (8) tathāgatānām anutpādaḥ.
<div n="lb">In Dharmas 134 No. 5 is put before 4, otherwise 1--7 as
<div n="lb">in Mvy, but 8 (obviously by a secondary change) is wholly
<div n="lb">different: (1) narakopapattis, (2) tiryagupapattir, (3)
<div n="lb">yamalokopapattiḥ, (4) pratyantajanapadopapattir, (5)
<div n="lb">dīrghāyuṣadevopapattir, (6) indriyavikalatā, (7) mithyā-
<div n="lb">dṛṣṭiś, (8) cittotpādavirāgitatā (seems to be a different
<div n="lb">version of 6, which corresponds to Pali 7, while 8 of the
<div n="lb">others is omitted). As opposed to these there is only one
<div n="lb">{@kṣaṇa@}, {%opportune birth%}; see s.v. Eight akṣaṇa Mv ii.363.3;
<div n="lb">LV 412.14; Śikṣ 2.4; 114.14; Gv 116.16; Suv 41.13. The
<div n="lb">word never means {%misfortune%} in general, but only {%un-%}
<div n="lb">{%favorable birth%}, and in most cases clearly in just the sense
<div n="lb">described above. So Śikṣ 147.14 akṣaṇagatiṃ na gacchaty
<div n="lb">anyatra sattvaparipākāt, (a Bodhisattva) {%is not born in%}
<div n="lb">{%an inopportune birth, except to mature creatures%} (the transl.
<div n="lb">misunderstands); LV 278.22 akṣaṇāni pithitāny abhūvan,
<div n="lb">and 279.19 akṣaṇāḥ pithitāḥ, are explained by Gv 112.19
<div n="lb">sarvākṣaṇadvārakapāṭāni pithayiṣyati (or with text
[Page003-a+ 71]
<div n="lb">pithapayiṣ°, see Chap. 43, s.v.) {%he will close the door-panels%}
<div n="lb">{%(opening into) all the inopportune births%}. The akṣaṇa are
<div n="lb">śodhita, {%purified%}, LV 53.6; 357.5, or made śūnya, {%empty%},
<div n="lb">LV 358.13. Others: LV 12.3; 34.22; 275.21; 327.13; 364.7;
<div n="lb">Mv ii.358.5; 371.12; 392.5 = Śikṣ 306.1; Av i.291.12;
<div n="lb">RP 35.19; Śikṣ 69.5; Sukh 23.9; Gv 54.9 (preta-tiryaṅ-
<div n="lb">narakākṣaṇe-gatāḥ); cf. Lévi, Sūtrāl. 17.26. On SP 163.8
<div n="lb">akṣaṇāḥ saṃvṛtā cf. Senart's note Mv i.405 f.; it is (as
<div n="lb">Senart says) certainly secondary, the original being aghā(ḥ)
<div n="lb">aghasaṃvṛtā(ḥ), {%miseries, surrounded by miseries%} (in ap-
<div n="lb">position with {@lokāntarikā@}, q.v., sc. narakāḥ or nirayāḥ);
<div n="lb">akṣaṇāḥ in SP was, in my opinion as in Senart's (if I under-
<div n="lb">stand him), a noun and a near-synonym of aghā(ḥ),
<div n="lb">{%(constituting) unfavorable births%}, see {@agha@} (2). Perhaps
<div n="lb">akṣaṇasaṃvṛtā(ḥ) was originally read after it(?). In Dbh.g.
<div n="lb">7(343).4 read probably akṣaṇāḥ for text akṣalāḥ: sarve ti
<div n="lb">pāpapatitā 'kṣalāḥ (text) prabhonti.
