{@Kāśyapa@}¦ (= Pali Kassapa; Tib. ḥod sruṅs, {%light-%}
{%guard%}, e.g. on Mvy 93), ({@1@}) n. of a former Buddha, the one
immediately preceding Śākyamuni: often mentioned as
having predicted the latter, and esp. as one of a group
of three, the others being {@Krakucchanda@} and {@Kanaka-@}
{@muni@}, or equivalents; see the former for list of such re-
ferences; also alone (it being not always certain that this
particular Buddha is meant, cf. Mv i.58.8, ref. to 90,000
Buddhas of this name), Mv i.307.4 ff.; 312.2; 318.7 ff.;
[Page182-a+ 71]
iii.249.8; Divy 22.4 ff.; 54.12, 25; 76.26 ff.; 192.25 ff.;
233.21 ff.; 336.21; 337.17; 344.4 ff.; 347.1 ff.; 465.25 ff.;
504.26; Av i.237.11; 247.15, et alibi; Karmav 159.7; LV
172.9; 260.10; Mmk 104.17 ff.; ({@2@}) n. of one of Buddha's
leading disciples, also called {@Mahā-k°@} (= Pali Kassapa
or Mahā-k°), q.v.; there is no doubt that the same person
is, as a rule at least, meant by the two forms, notably
Kā° in Mvy 1031; Mv iii.48.2; SP 116.4; 121.3 ff.; 144.2 ff.;
206.8 ff.; Divy 83.10 ff.; 396.1; K. is given the title
dhutaguṇāgrapāraga Mv i.64.14 (ff.), where he is involved
as an interlocutor at the First Council, perhaps its pre-
siding officer (as in Pali, DPPN); he then and there causes
Kātyāyana to discourse on the 10 bhūmi; similarly Divy
61.28 calls him dhūtaguṇa-vādinām agro, and cf. Pali AN
i.23.19 where Mahākassapa is dhutavādānaṃ (v.l. dhū-
taṅgadharānaṃ) agga; mentioned in Candropama Sūtra,
Hoernle MR 40 ff., = Pali SN ii.197 ff. where (Mahā)
Kassapa corresponds; among mahāśrāvakas, Divy 182.22;
268.6; in Divy 573.8 it appears, strangely, that ārya-
kāśyapasya is an epithet of (the next word) Kātyāyanasya
(pañcaśataparivārasya; in the story which follows only
Mahākātyāyana appears!); it is not clear whether the same
person is meant by āyuṣmān daśabalaḥ Kāśyapaḥ Divy
275.5, and 7 daśabala-Kāś°;* no monk of this title is re-
corded in Pali; in Vv. comm. 148.24 Kassapassa dasaba-
lassa kāle refers to the Buddha Kāś°, tho I find no evidence
to support PTSD and DPPN in stating that dasabala
was ‘especially’ an epithet of his, ‘to distinguish him from
other Kassapas’ as DPPN says; dasabala (BHS daśa°) of
course usually refers to a Buddha, and in Pali generally
to the B. Gotama; there are at least four other disciples
of his having this name, see {@Uruvilvā-k°, Kumāra-k°,@}
{@Gayā-k°, Nadī-k°; (3)@} n. of an ascetic (ṛṣi) who once
lived in the Himālaya: Mv ii.106.16, a previous birth of
{@Mahākāśyapa@}, q.v., 114.12; ({@4@}) n. of another (?) ascetic
(ṛṣi) who lived in the hermitage {@sāhaṃjanī@} (q.v.; this
is not mentioned in connection with the prec. Kā°, and the
stories told of them are different): Mv iii.143.13 ff. (in
story of Ekaśṛṅga and Nalinī; = Pali Kassapa 9 in DPPN);
prob. the same (at least also living in Sāhaṃjanī) Mv
iii.362.14; 363.19. See also {@Pūraṇa Kāśyapa; Jaṅghā-k°;@}
{@Vṛddha-k°@}.--*Correction in proof: MPS 49.16 names
four mahāsthavirāḥ in the world (pṛthivyāṃ) at the time
of Buddha's death; two of them were Daśabala-Kāśyapa
(one word) and Mahā-Kāśyapa. This settles the above
question; D.K. is a separate person.
