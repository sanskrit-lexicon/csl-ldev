{@mahāyaśākhya@}¦, adj., = {@maheśākhya@}, q.v., Śikṣ
<div n="lb">303.11 (vs; meter correct). Is this only a hyper-Sktism,
<div n="lb">or does it give a clue to the real etymology of maheśākhya
<div n="lb">and Pali mahesakkha? {%Having a very glorious name%} fits
<div n="lb">the word at least as well, and is in my opinion at least
<div n="lb">as plausible etymologically, as the traditional (but rather
<div n="lb">mechanical) analysis mahā plus īśa plus ākhyā.
