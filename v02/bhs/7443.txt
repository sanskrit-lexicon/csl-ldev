<div n="lb">to which it is put in Pali and BHS (dress of laymen and

<div n="lb">both to occur in mss., but editions are exceptionally
<div n="lb">confusing. Even the usually so reliable Senart always
<div n="lb">prints (kalpa-)duṣya, but in his Index reads (kalpa-)dūṣya,
<div n="lb">without explanation and without citing any v.l. in the
<div n="lb">Crit. App. In SP usually and in LV only dūṣya is printed;
<div n="lb">Lefm.'s mss. of LV often read duṣya, or corruptly puṣpa
