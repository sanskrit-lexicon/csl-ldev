<div n="lb">also as n. of a work or type of literature, sometimes, at
<div n="lb">least, referring to a specific collection of such stories like
<div n="lb">the Pali Jāt.: as one of the nine (Mvy twelve) pravacana,
<div n="lb">{%gospel texts%} (Mvy dharma-pra°), Dharmas 62; Mvy 1275;
<div n="lb">in a similar list, SP 45.7; Jātake Śyāmākajātakaprabhṛtiṣu

<div n="lb">taken by Senart in sense 2 above, but I think wrongly;
<div n="lb">I believe it means {%nativity%} in the sense of (astrologically

<div n="lb">possibly {%future birth%}. This seems to me indicated by

<div n="lb">Senart misunderstands: (bodhisattvacaritaṃ…) jātakā-

<div n="lb">prapadyanti (v.l. prayanti) 105.7; the mg., as Senart
<div n="lb">suggests, seems (from -prabhṛtikāni) to be that they
<div n="lb">{%begin%} with the 8th bhūmi; but as this passage occurs in
<div n="lb">a description of the 4th bhūmi, it is {%future%} births or
<div n="lb">destines that are meant. In i.192.19 (vs), after saṃ-
