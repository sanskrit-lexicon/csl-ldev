{@pratipadyati@}¦ (Pali paṭipajjati seems so used, but
<div n="lb">hardly Skt.; cf. {@pratipatti, °pad, °panna@}), {%behaves%}, with

<div n="lb">LV 254.2 (prose), {%suppose now I behave with (practise%}
<div n="lb">{%according to the method of) taking scant food%}. This seems the
<div n="lb">most probable interpretation; otherwise Tib., which ren-
<div n="lb">ders the instr. -tayā by la, as if dative, and then has nan
<div n="lb">tan bya ḥo, {%I shall make earnest effort to eat scant food%}; I
<div n="lb">can hardly believe this is what the text means.
