{@utkoṭana@}¦, nt. (see below), or (var. in Kyoto ed.;
<div n="lb">and Mironov without v.l.) khoṭana, nt.: °nam Mvy 8423.
<div n="lb">Both form and mg. obscure; occurs between bhikṣu-
<div n="lb">paiśunyam and duṣṭhulārocanam. Tib. skyo sṅogs (var.
<div n="lb">brṅogs) byed pa, {%causing quarrels%}; Chin. {%disturbing the%}
<div n="lb">{%saṃgha%}; Jap. {%raising questions about a matter already%}
<div n="lb">{%decided%}. The last implies derivation from {@utkoṭayati@},
<div n="lb">q.v. Skt. has nothing helpful on either reading. Pali
<div n="lb">ukkoṭana-ka, Vin. ii.94.7, means {%reopening a settled question%}
<div n="lb">(wrongly PTSD), just as the verb ukkoṭeti seems always
<div n="lb">so used. But ukkoṭana is defined by DN comm. i.79.30
<div n="lb">as {%taking bribes%} (to obstruct justice), which finds support
<div n="lb">in AMg. ukkoḍā, {%bribery%} (Ratnach.), and seems to fit
<div n="lb">better the Pali occurrences; it is always found in a list
<div n="lb">of instances of trickery and deceit (typical is DN i.5.22
<div n="lb">ukkoṭana-vañcana-nikati-sāciyogā paṭivirato); cf. the Skt.
<div n="lb">root kuṭ. If khoṭana (Skt. Gr., {%limping%}) is the true reading,
<div n="lb">I know of no plausible interpretation.
