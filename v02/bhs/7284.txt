<div n="lb">(in comp.), {%boy%}: dvātriṃśad-dārikā-sahasrāṇi LV 128.11
<div n="lb">(prose), all mss. acc. to Lefm.; dārikebhiḥ LV 133.6 (vs),
<div n="lb">two mss. with Calc. dāra°. There can hardly be a reference
<div n="lb">to girls (cf. Weller 26), and at least the final -ā of dārikā
<div n="lb">must, it seems, be a corruption for -a. Perhaps read
<div n="lb">dāraka both times. Note the same cpd. with dāraka 128.9;
<div n="lb">the word seems to occur only once in this passage in
<div n="lb">Tib.
