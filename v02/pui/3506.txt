{%Kṛṣṇa%} (I)¦ — twenty-three avatār of Hari; according to
one version, the twentieth {%avatār.%} Went to Dvārakā,
bowed to his parents and entered the palace.<sup>1</sup> His boyhood
sports — sucked Ulūkika's life, kicked Śakaṭa to pieces and
uprooted two Arjuna trees; brought solace to the Gopas of
Vraja by expelling the serpent Kāliya from the pool near by
and protected their cattle from forest fire. In his mouth
Yaśodā saw the fourteen worlds. Rescued Nanda from
fear of Varuṇa's noose and recovered the Gopas imprisoned
by Vyoma Asura. Shielded the Gokulam from rains by
holding up Govardhana Mt. as an umbrella; cut off the head
of Kubera's attendant who tried to seize the Gopis engaged
in Rāsakṛīḍā with Kṛṣṇa. Vanquished several daityas and
their wicked kings; manifested Himself through Satyavatī
and divided the Vedas into many branches;<sup>2</sup> Lord and goal
of Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis, Sātvatas, etc. Supreme Brahman.<sup>3</sup>
[Page1-436+ 43]
<div n="P"/>Just on the eve of the avatār, Brahmā and other gods
pray to him in the womb of Devakī.<sup>4</sup> Birth at the time of
constellation Rohiṇi, first new moon in winter, Abhijit Nak-
ṣatra, Jayanti night, Vijaya-muhūrta and festivities con-
nected with it; enjoyed by Vasudeva and Devakī. Their
prayer, and Kṛṣṇa recalled their previous births. Taken to
Yaśodā's delivery room at Nandavraja, stupefying the
guardsmen of the jail and crossing Yamunā in floods at
dead of night; Yogamāyā born to Yaśodā taken back to the
jail ward.<sup>5</sup> Yogamāyā announced her birth to Kaṃsā,<sup>6</sup> His
jātakarmā.<sup>7</sup> Killed Pūtanā, when at Kamsā's instance, she
attempted to poison him by nursing him; Yaśodā warded off
evil, (Rakṣā) to Kṛṣṇa by waving cow's tail round him, by
placing cow's dung on the twelve points of his body and by
purifying him with cow's urine, with prayers to Hari to
protect him from evil spirits.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first turning in bed was celebrated with festivity.
Kṛṣṇa slept under cradle beneath the cart when he kicked
the cart which capsized. This roused suspicion of {%gṛhapīḍa%}
in Yaśodā's mind. {%Śānti%} done when cows, food, etc., were
given to Brahmanas. Once the demon Tṛṇāvarta created a
whirlwind which swept away all {%Vraja%} and took up baby
Kṛṣṇa high up in the sky to the embarrassment of Yaśodā
and others. At that time Kṛṣṇa took hold of his neck and
strangled him. He fell dead. The child Kṛṣṇa opened his
mouth and showed his mother the whole universe.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Nāmakaraṇam%} as Vāsudeva. Boyish sports in {%Vraja,%}
charged with eating mud; lived with Nanda and his wife
who were the same Droṇa and Dharā born as Nanda and
Yaśodā by the command of Brahmā. When once Yaśodā
left the churning pot to mind the boiling milk overflowing
in the oven, Kṛṣṇa broke the curd pot and ran away with
butter to feed a monkey. So he was bound with a rope to
an {%ulūkhala%} (mortar) but the rope always fell two inches
[Page1-437+ 40]
short in spite of bits being added. At last Kṛṣṇa pitied her
and allowed himself to be tied; with the mortar he passed
between two tall Arjuna trees, when down fell the trees,
out of which emerged two men Nalakubera and Maṇigrīva
(sons of Kubera) who had been cursed by Nārada. Kṛṣṇa
blessed them and sent them back to their abode.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Enjoyed the company of Gopis singing and dancing.
Gifts on his {%janmanakṣatra%} day. Noticed a Daitya in the guise
of a calf and taking him by the tail, he whirled him to death
and flung the body on the top of a {%kapitha%} tree. On another
occasion Asura Baka met him in the guise of a crane, when
Kṛṣṇa tore its jaws asunder. Once when in the forest with
his playmates, Agha, an asura friend of Kaṃsā took the form
of a boa-constrictor with a view to devour the cattle and
all boys together. All of them entered his open mouth with
Kṛṣṇa who took his life out of his body and came out to
the wonderment of gods. The {%ajāgara%} skin when dried was
a cave for Vraja people. Agha, however, attained salva-
tion.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>One day the boys sat and ate merrily when the cattle
had gone far into the hill and dale and Kṛṣṇa promised to
bring them back. In the meantime Brahmā had them hidden.
So Kṛṣṇa created duplicates of the cattle and the children
that had been lost. These went home as usual and this
continued for a year, when Brahmā released the hidden cows
which suckled their calves, and came to see the child, the
one Brahman without a second, and belauded the baby
Hari, and returned to his region. More boyhood sports.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>In regularly tending cows, imitated voice of beasts and
birds in Brindāvana just like a rustic. Once the cattle
drank of the poisonous waters of the Yamunā and became
unconscious. After reviving them he found the reptile
Kālīya in the waters. He immediately jumped into the pool
and was enclosed in its coils. At this Nanda and the whole
Vraja moved to the banks of the river with great concern.
[Page1-438+ 39]
Rāma advised them to be cool. Slowly Kṛṣṇa brought the
reptile under his control, and getting on its hood, began to
dance, when the Kālīya acknowledged defeat. Finding his
end near, Kālīya's wives prayed to Kṛṣṇa to spare him. The
generous Lord allowed him to make his abode in the sea,
thus purifying the Yamunā once for all.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>After this incident the whole Vraja was encamped for
the night in that vicinity. A forest fire attacked the camp,
when Kṛṣṇa swallowed it and protected its inmates. His
dances and songs; other past-times. Among the games was
one in which the victor rode on the back of the vanquished.
Kṛṣṇa carried Śrīdāma on his back.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Once again the cattle went astray in the thick forest,
and surrounded by fire they bellowed in thirst and hunger.
Kṛṣṇa and his playmates found it impossible to reach the
spot. So Kṛṣṇa got upon a tree and called the cattle by
names, and they responded. Asking his followers to shut
their eyes, he swallowed the forest fire. When they opened
their eyes, they found themselves in their homes.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa filled Brindāvana with Gāndharvan music and
played at times on flute. Hid the clothes of Gopis who
observed {%Kātyāyani vrata%} to get him as their husband, and
returned them only when they saluted with their two hands
over their heads as a penance for bathing naked during the
period of a {%vrata.%} It was a severe day in summer when
some Gopas approached him for food. Kṛṣṇa advised them
to go to the neighbouring {%yajñaśāla%} and ask for food, sing-
ing the praises of Balarāma and himself. The sacrificers
were silent at their request. Kṛṣṇa asked them to repeat
their request to ladies in his name. The ladies took four
kinds of food and in spite of protest by their male relations,
they came to have {%darsan%} of the Lord and placed before Him
all the eatables. On Kṛṣṇa's advice they went back to com-
plete the sacrifice, and assured them of their being accepted
by their relations and the world. Their male relations
[Page1-439+ 39]
regretted having missed a chance of meeting the Lord. Then
food was distributed among his friends.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa saw the Gopas worshipping Indra and as resi-
dents of hills and forests, he suggested worship of mountains
and cows. When this was accepted, Indra sent a heavy
downpour which was warded off by Kṛṣṇa, a boy of seven,<sup>17</sup>
holding up the Govardhana for a week. A visit from Indra
and Surabhi who anointed him, Indra, of Goloka and gave
him a new name Govinda. Rescued his father Nanda from
Varuṇa region and took him with other Gopas to Brahma-
ḥrada where the Vedas were praising Hari. Once when
playing on a flute, the Gopīs who were in the midst of house-
hold duties stopped them and came to where he was in spite
of protest from their male relations. Kṛṣṇa advised them
to go back to Vraja and be loyal to their husbands. They
refused to return as their minds were fixed upon him and
longed for {%mokṣa,%} and insisted they were his {%dāsis%} and should
be accepted. After some time he disappeared for their peace
and redemption. They indulged in {%gītam,%} when the Lord
appeared in their midst and shone like {%Puruṣa%} among {%śaktis.%}
After consoling them he engaged them in a {%rāsakrīḍa,%} and
finding them wearied, he engaged them in watersports and
sports in the {%upavana%} on the river-bank. There was no
carnal act of sin. The Lord who had no {%bandha,%} did all this
in sport.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Released Nanda from a reptile who turned out to be
vidyādhara Sudarśana. One day Śankhacūda a follower of
Kaṃsā seized some ladies of Kṛṣṇa's party and ran away.
They cried for succour. Kṛṣṇa and Rāma followed. He left the
women behind and ran. Rāma took charge of the ladies
while Kṛṣṇa pursued him, cut off his head and took the
cūḍāmaṇi which he presented to Rāma. Killed Arīṣṭa in
the form of a bull who entered the Vraja and terrified the
inmates.<sup>19</sup>
[Page1-440+ 37]
<div n="P"/>Killed Keśin who came to the Vraja in the guise of a
horse and became Keśava; killed one Vyoma in the guise of
a gopāla; seen milking cows with Rāma by Akrūra who came
to Dvārakā at the instance of Kaṃsā; agreed readily to start
for Mathurā at Akrūra's message. With Akrūra, the two
brothers arrived at Mathurā. and asked their friend to go
home. He requested them to visit his house to which they
agreed only after vanquishing Kaṃsā. Next day afternoon,
the two brothers and their Gopa followers went round the
city and the women from terraces enjoyed the sight of Kṛṣṇa
and Rāma. On the way he met a washerman and asked
for good clothes. On his refusal, he was killed, and all his
clothes taken and distributed to his Gopas. Then they met
a garland-maker Sudāma who voluntarily offered flower-
garlands. Him he blessed and went. Next he saw a hunch-
back woman carrying unguents to Kaṃsā. For the mere
asking she offered the whole of it to them. So Kṛṣṇa con-
verted her to a handsome lady who invited him to her house.
This was agreed after finishing his work. Then they went
through the bazaar and were rewarded with betels, sandal,
etc., by merchants. Lastly they entered the place where
the bow festival was held. Kṛṣṇa broke it easily. The
guards who attacked them were put to death. It was
evening when they returned to the camp outside the city.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>On his way to the wrestlers' arena, Kṛṣṇa vanquished
Kuvalayāpīḍa with some effort. Taking its tusks, entered
the enclosure with Balarāma. Accepted challenge from
the wrestler Cānūra. The latter fell dead after fighting.
The same fate met Śala and Tośalaka. Finding Kaṃsā
ready to attack his relations, Kṛṣṇa overpowered him and
killed him in a minute: condoled with the women of the
dead and set his parents free; consoled his parents for their
troubles and was embraced by them in love. Enthroned
Ugrasena, as Yadus could not sit on the throne owing to
a curse of Yayāti. A regin of peace ushered in Mathurā.<sup>21</sup>
[Page1-441+ 38]
<div n="P"/>Nanda and Gopas were sent back to Vraja with
honours. {%Upanayanam%} of Kṛṣṇa. With Balarāma Kṛṣṇa
went to Sāndīpani and learnt all arts in 64 days. Hearing that
Sāndīpani's son was washed away by the sea at Prabhāsā,
Kṛṣṇa went to the spot and was told by the seagod that an
Asura Pañcajana carried him off. Then he went to Yama's
abode, and recovering his son, handed him over to the {%guru%}
as {%gurudakṣiṇa%} and came home. Requested Uddhava to go
to Vraja with a message from him to Nanda and Gopis that
he would be visiting them shortly. As promised he went
to Sairandhri's house with Uddhava. It was decorated
according to rules of Kāmaśāstra, and after a brief stay, left
it for Akrūra's with Uddhava and Rāma. Akrūra extended
a royal welcome. Kṛṣṇa praised him as their {%guru%} and
requested him to go to Hāstinapur and find out the position
of the Pāṇḍavas. Returned to their residence.<sup>22</sup> Kṛṣṇa
heard of the siege of Mathurā by Jarāsandha and was devis-
ing a plan of attack when two chariots descended from
heaven fully armoured. Also {%Sudarśana,%} his {%cakra%} and
other weapons came down to him and to Rāma. Rāma took
a chariot and the {%hala%} (plough), but was considered by Jarā-
sandha as a boy and not his equal. Kṛṣṇa made defence
arrangements at the four gates, and went out in his chariot
of Garuda ensign by the northern gate to where Caidya and
Māgadha were. Caidya's challenge and death; prevented
Rāma from fettering Jarāsandha, and entered the city in
victory and gave the spoils of war to Ugrasena, their king.
Second and third defence of Mathurā. Prevented Kum-
bhāṇḍa and Kūpakarṇa from using māyā in war by the
application of {%vijñānāstra.%} Honoured after victory by the
{%Sabhā%} of the Yadus.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>He next desired to see Gomanta and the hill fortress.
Left with Rāma towards the south crossing the Yamunā, and
many towns and villages. Saw on the way Paraśurāma
engaged in austere {%tapas%} and bowed to him. Paraśurāma
[Page1-442+ 39]
suggested killing Śrgālavāsudeva, a wicked chieftain of
Karavīrapura at the foot of the Gomanta. When they
reached the place, Śṛgālavāsudeva offered fight, and his
head was cut off by Kṛṣṇa. Welcomed by the citizens of
Karavīrapura, they spent there four months after sending
the spoils of war to Mathurā. Got up the hill Gomanta
where Garuḍa met Kṛṣṇa and placing his crown on his head,
left. Reached Mathurā with a large army. Finding Yavana
besieging the city and Jarāsandha leading the eighteenth
expedition,, Kṛṣṇa in consultation with Rāma resolved to
build a fortress of 12 yojanas in the sea to place their kith
and kin in security. So a city was built according to {%Vāstu%}
śāstra to which Indra sent {%Sudharmā%} and {%Pārijāta.%} Varuṇa
supplied horses and Kubera the eight {%Nidhis.%} It became a
Yādava settlement. Attacked by (Kāla) Yavana, Kṛṣṇa
unarmed fled to the cave where Mucukunda was asleep.
Here Yavana was burnt to ashes by Mucukunda's energy.
Mucukunda's surprise to see Kṛṣṇa and his prayer for salva-
tion. Kṛṣṇa spoke of his future birth as Brāhmaṇa and
final salvation.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa returned to Ugrasena at Mathurā, raised the
siege of Yavana troops and went to Dvārakā with his plunder.
On the way Jarāsandha's army in {%makara vyūha%} attacked
him but was broken by throwing a huge tree. Returned to
Dvārakā with spoils of war left by Yavanas. Jarāsandha's
attack again when Rāma and Kṛṣṇa fled to the Gomanta
whose top crest was burnt, while Jarāsandha thought they
were dead they reached Dvārakā safe.<sup>25</sup> Sent Kṛtavarṇa to
ascertain from Hāstināpura whether Pāṇḍavas had defeated
Drupada. Married Rukmiṇi by the {%Rākṣasa%} form of mar-
riage, defeating Jarāsandha and others of the Caidya party
in battle. Received with due honours the Brāhmaṇa mes-
senger from Rukmiṇi and promised to do the needful. With
the Brāhmaṇa and Rāma, Kṛṣṇa drove from Ānartas to
Vidarbhas in a night. Was honoured by Bhīṣmaka and
allotted separate residence outside his capital. Ladies of
[Page1-443+ 38]
Kuṇḍina said that Kṛṣṇa was suitable to Rukmiṇi. Seeing
Rukmiṇi returning from the Devi temple, he took her in his
chariot in the midst of other kings and drove fast. Jarā-
sandha and others pursued but soon returned with dis-
appointment. Rukmi's resolve to kill Kṛṣṇa and then
enter Kuṇḍina. When he offered battle and was about
to be killed, Rukmini appealed to the Lord to save her
brother. At this he was tied to the chariot with his hair
and moustache shaved. Advised by Rāma that punishment
of Rukmī was not in order. Married Rukmiṇi according to
{%Śāśtras%} amidst festivities in Dvārakā. Owing to Śiva's
grace, got sacred sons of whom one was Pradyumna by Ruk-
miṇī, being Kāma in a previous birth. Killed Sambara who
stole the baby. Saw the lost Pradyumna and his wife Ratī
in his residence, and hearing their account from Nārada,
embraced the couple. Present at Pradyumna's marriage.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="P"/>Requested Satrājita to give the Syamantaka gem for
their king but he refused. Suspected by Satrājita to be res-
ponsible for his brother Prasena's disappearance in the
forest; recovered the jewel from Jāmbavan after fight-
ing for 28 days, and got also his daughter Jāmbavatī in
marriage. The jewel was returned to Satrājita in the public
assembly. Married Satrājita's daughter Satyabhāmā, and
when the jewel was offered, it was returned. Went with
Rāma to the Kurus after the rumoured death of the Pāṇḍa-
vas and Kunti; met the Pāṇḍavas at Pāñcāla city in the
guise of Brāhmaṇas; killed Śatadhanvan, the murderer of
his father-in-law Satrājita. Sent for Akrūra and asked him
to exhibit Syamantaka in his possession, and returned it
to him afterwards.<sup>27</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa once went to Hāstināpura to see the Pāṇḍavas
and was heartily welcomed. Paid respects to Yudhiṣṭhira
and Bhīma, embraced Arjuna and received respects from
Nakula and Sahadeva. Kuntī welcomed him also. When
he was spending that winter there, he went to the forest
[Page1-444+ 41]
with Arjuna for hunting and there met an accomplished lady
when Arjuna addressed. Hearing that she was the
daughter of the Sun waiting to marry Kṛṣṇa, the latter took
her home. In the meantime Kṛṣṇa asked Viśvakarmā to
build a city for the Pāṇḍavas. Acting as Arjuna's charioteer,
he caused the Khāṇḍava forest to be given over to fire.
Returned to Dvārakā and married Kālindī, Sun's daughter.
Then he married Mitravindā of Avanti, an aunt's daughter.
Received Satyā, daughter of Nagnajit of Ayodhyā by curb-
ing the ferocity of seven bulls, with a large dowry of chariots,
elephants and treasure. Jealous kings were driven away
by Arjuna. Married another aunt's daughter Bhadrā.
Took Lakṣmaṇā, daughter of the Madra king and thousands
of maidens from Naraka's harem.<sup>28</sup>
<div n="P"/>Indra came one day to Dvārakā and reported to Kṛṣṇa
the mischief done to him by Naraka. Entering Prāgjyotiṣa,
Kṛṣṇa pulled down ramparts and walls and cut off Mura's
five heads. His seven sons attacked him led by Pāṭha in
vain. Naraka also attacked and had his head cut off. Kṛṣṇa
entered the city welcomed by its people, saw Maṇiparvata
of Indra and the umbrella of Varuṇa and gave them back
to them. Earth, mother of Naraka came before Kṛṣṇa and
handed over the {%kuṇḍalas%} of Aditi, informing him that
Naraka was her son by the touch of Hari in Vārāha form.
Then he entered the harem of the Asura and sent away
16000 (some 16100) maidens to Dvārakā and them he
married, after distributing the spoils of war among his fellow
companions.<sup>29</sup> Had by his wives 18000 sons.
<div n="P"/>With Satyabhāmā he visited Indra's abode and after
giving the {%kuṇḍalas%} to Aditi, he came back with {%Pārijāta%}
against Indra's will, because his queen wanted it. He
enjoyed the company of all his wives, taking a separate form
for each wife. Indra's attack on Kṛṣṇa with gods like
Varuṇa, Vāyu, etc., for taking away {%Pārijāta.%} Their defeat
and Indra's apology. Kṛṣṇa consoled him. Welcomed back
in Dvārakā.<sup>30</sup>
[Page1-445+ 37]
<div n="P"/>Love quarrel with his consort Rukmiṇī described. Once
when Kṛṣṇa was sitting at leisure, Rukmiṇi who was nearby
fanned him. Kṛṣṇa indulged in fun and asked her how she
chose a poor fellow like him leaving princes of equal status
with her, and added that he was willing to let her go and
marry a powerful Kṣatriya prince. This put out poor Ruk-
miṇi who wept bitterly, speaking words showing her
unflinching loyalty to him. Noticing her sincerity Kṛṣṇa
consoled her that he simply cut a joke. He said that she
knew him to be Hari to whom Rājaṛṣis like Aṅga, Nahuṣa
and Gaya had dedicated their lives leaving their kingdoms,
and that Brahmā and Śiva sang his praises. Kṛṣṇa assured
her of his loyalty to her. In this way he led a household
life just like an ordinary mortal. Each one of his eight chief
queens gave birth to ten sons, and each thought that Kṛṣṇa
was only living with her, as there was a Kṛṣṇa by the side
of each lady including the 16000 of Naraka's harem. He
played with them blindman's buff, exchanging betels, scents,
etc. The chief queens were Rukmini, Satyabhāmā, Jāmba-
vatī, Satyā, Kālindī, Mādri, Mitravindā, and Bhadrā.
Attended Aniruddha's marriage with Rocanā at Bhojakaṭa.
Heard from Nārada of Aniruddha's imprisonment by Bāṇa
of 1000 arms and besieged Śonitapura. Defeated Śiva who
came on Bāṇā's behalf and at Śiva's request, let Bāṇa go
with his four arms remaining. Returned to Dvārakā with
Aniruddha and Uṣā.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard from a Brāhmaṇa of the externment of Pāṇḍa-
vas to the forest, and riding on a chariot with Satyabhāmā,
met them and consoled them; came back with Subhadrā and
Abhimanyu. Heard a report of a huge lizard in a well, and
lifting it up, he found it to be a divinity who revealed him-
self as king Nṛga and who went to heaven. Taught the
citizens of Dvāraka on the inviolability of Brāhmaṇas’
property.<sup>32</sup>
[Page1-446+ 37]
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa heard of Pauṇḍraka's invasion of Dvārakā in his
absence. Had a message from him either to give up the title
of Vāsudeva or offer battle. Ugrasena and others laughed
at this. Kṛṣṇa went to Kāśī and had the heads of Pauṇḍraka
and his ally cut off and their army destroyed. Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvāraka. An {%ābhicāra%} Agni was sent by Pauṇḍ-
raka's son through the grace of Śiva but was vanquished by
Hari's {%cakra.%} By his {%yoga%} power Kṛṣṇa appeared at the
mansions of each of his 16000 wives, engaged in a normal
domestic life. When Nārada entered every house, he saw
the same Kṛṣṇa in each; got up early in the morning and
meditated on Brahman; gave cows, etc., to the Brāhmaṇas,
saw first ghee, then mirror, cows, gods, etc. Heard from a
messenger of the difficulties of kings imprisoned by Jarā-
sandha. Advised by Uddhava to vanquish Jarāsandha with
the aid of Bhīma at Yudhiṣṭhira's {%Rājasūya.%} Kṛṣṇa's route
to Hāstināpura where he was received by the Pāṇḍavas.
Draupadī welcomed his wives and, these were put up com-
fortably. Hearing Jarāsandha still unconquered, Kṛṣṇa
with Bhīma and Arjuna went to Girivraja in Brāhmaṇas’
disguise and asked for meals. They then threw off their
disguise and called him to battle in which Bhīma won.
After releasing prisoners, Kṛṣṇa enthroned Sahadeva, son
of Jarāsandha.<sup>33</sup> The kings thus released after the fall of
Jarāsandha were 20800, praised the Lord and requested that
they might ever remember Him. Kṛṣṇa asked them to go
back to their places and assume charge of governments by
ruling righteously. Sahadeva arranged their bath, dress
and meals, after which they left for where Yudhiṣṭhira and
his family were. Received the first honour in the {%Rājasūya%}
of Yudhiṣṭhira when Śiśupāla protested in a vilifying speech.
His head was cut off. Lived in Hāstināpura for some months
at the request of Yudhiṣṭhīra and others. Attended to {%arghya%}
and {%pādya%} for Brāhmaṇas in the {%Rājasūya.%} Welcomed
Nārada who informed him of the necessity of vanquishing
Śālva. Left for Dvārakā hearing of its blockade by Śālva
[Page1-447+ 37]
who applied illusory powers. Kṛṣṇa broke his car and killed
him.
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa went as an ambassador of the Pāṇḍavas to Dur-
yodhana. He was sought to be made prisoner in vain; came
back determined to declare war. In the war served as
Arjuna's charioteer, and after the war Kṛṣṇa condoled with
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and after anointing Yudhiṣṭhīra, returned to
Dvārakā.
<div n="P"/>One day there came Kucaila, a Brāhmaṇa classmate of
Kṛṣṇa, a poor man with many children. Induced by his
wife he visited Kṛṣṇa who welcomed him with Rukmiṇi,
indulged in talks of old school days, partook of the {%pṛthuka%}
rice which Kucaila's wife had sent, and sent him away after
keeping him for a night.<sup>34</sup>
<div n="P"/>Left for Syamantapañcaka for solar eclipse, met Gopis
there and taught them the nature of the Absolute. Sages
waited on him and praised his glory. His joy at Vasudeva's
sacrifice. Honoured Nanda. Praised by his father, Kṛṣṇa
replied that Ātma is only one. At the request of Devakī
to get back all her sons killed by Kamsā, Kṛṣṇa entered
Sutalam and with leave of Bali, took them to his mother who
embraced them in affection. These children who were
degraded gods gained their old form and went to heaven.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>Subhadrā was his sister, and Arjuna carried her off with
his knowledge and against the wish of Balarāma. He went
with sages to Mithilā where was his Brāhmaṇa devotee Śru-
tadeva. The latter and the king Maithilā welcomed him and
requested him to stay. Kṛṣṇa did not like to disoblige them
and so stayed in both houses taking two different forms, thus
purifying Nimi line, and pleasing Śrutadeva.<sup>36</sup>
<div n="P"/>Performed {%Aśvamedha%} sacrifice in the course of which
he had to go to Vaikuṇṭha with Arjuna to recover the lost
children of a Dvārakā Brāhmaṇa who preferred a complaint.
After return with the lost boy, he had his {%avabhṛta%} cele-
[Page1-448+ 38]
brated in the Yamunā. Then he continued his righteous
rule and spent a good time in Dvārakā enjoying pleasures
with his chosen wives.<sup>37</sup>
<div n="P"/>His service to the world was to kill Daityas and relieve
the burden of the Earth. Resolved to destroy the Yadu race
and reach his eternal abode; approved of the curse of the
sages against the Yadu race. Brahmā and other gods visited
him, appealing to him to go back to Vaikuṇṭha. He agreed.
Uddhava expressed a wish to follow him but was advised by
Kṛṣṇa to lead a righteous life. Incidentally Kṛṣṇa narrated
to him the conversation of a certain Avadhūta and Yadu.
Insisting on {%yama%} and {%niyama,%} and duties incumbent on
{%varṇa%} and {%āśrama.%} Then he described who was said to be
in bondage, who was a free man and a righteous person, and
he also explained the need and importance of {%Satsanga.%} He
proceeded to instruct Uddhava on the nature of the {%guṇas,%}
