{%Kṛṣṇa%} (I)¦ — twenty-three avatār of Hari; according to
<div n="lb"/>one version, the twentieth {%avatār.%} Went to Dvārakā,
<div n="lb"/>bowed to his parents and entered the palace.<sup>1</sup> His boyhood
<div n="lb"/>sports — sucked Ulūkika's life, kicked Śakaṭa to pieces and
<div n="lb"/>uprooted two Arjuna trees; brought solace to the Gopas of
<div n="lb"/>Vraja by expelling the serpent Kāliya from the pool near by
<div n="lb"/>and protected their cattle from forest fire. In his mouth
<div n="lb"/>Yaśodā saw the fourteen worlds. Rescued Nanda from
<div n="lb"/>fear of Varuṇa's noose and recovered the Gopas imprisoned
<div n="lb"/>by Vyoma Asura. Shielded the Gokulam from rains by
<div n="lb"/>holding up Govardhana Mt. as an umbrella; cut off the head
<div n="lb"/>of Kubera's attendant who tried to seize the Gopis engaged
<div n="lb"/>in Rāsakṛīḍā with Kṛṣṇa. Vanquished several daityas and
<div n="lb"/>their wicked kings; manifested Himself through Satyavatī
<div n="lb"/>and divided the Vedas into many branches;<sup>2</sup> Lord and goal
<div n="lb"/>of Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis, Sātvatas, etc. Supreme Brahman.<sup>3</sup>
[Page1-436+ 43]
<div n="P"/>Just on the eve of the avatār, Brahmā and other gods
<div n="lb"/>pray to him in the womb of Devakī.<sup>4</sup> Birth at the time of
<div n="lb"/>constellation Rohiṇi, first new moon in winter, Abhijit Nak-
<div n="lb"/>ṣatra, Jayanti night, Vijaya-muhūrta and festivities con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with it; enjoyed by Vasudeva and Devakī. Their
<div n="lb"/>prayer, and Kṛṣṇa recalled their previous births. Taken to
<div n="lb"/>Yaśodā's delivery room at Nandavraja, stupefying the
<div n="lb"/>guardsmen of the jail and crossing Yamunā in floods at
<div n="lb"/>dead of night; Yogamāyā born to Yaśodā taken back to the
<div n="lb"/>jail ward.<sup>5</sup> Yogamāyā announced her birth to Kaṃsā,<sup>6</sup> His
<div n="lb"/>jātakarmā.<sup>7</sup> Killed Pūtanā, when at Kamsā's instance, she
<div n="lb"/>attempted to poison him by nursing him; Yaśodā warded off
<div n="lb"/>evil, (Rakṣā) to Kṛṣṇa by waving cow's tail round him, by
<div n="lb"/>placing cow's dung on the twelve points of his body and by
<div n="lb"/>purifying him with cow's urine, with prayers to Hari to
<div n="lb"/>protect him from evil spirits.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first turning in bed was celebrated with festivity.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa slept under cradle beneath the cart when he kicked
<div n="lb"/>the cart which capsized. This roused suspicion of {%gṛhapīḍa%}
<div n="lb"/>in Yaśodā's mind. {%Śānti%} done when cows, food, etc., were
<div n="lb"/>given to Brahmanas. Once the demon Tṛṇāvarta created a
<div n="lb"/>whirlwind which swept away all {%Vraja%} and took up baby
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa high up in the sky to the embarrassment of Yaśodā
<div n="lb"/>and others. At that time Kṛṣṇa took hold of his neck and
<div n="lb"/>strangled him. He fell dead. The child Kṛṣṇa opened his
<div n="lb"/>mouth and showed his mother the whole universe.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Nāmakaraṇam%} as Vāsudeva. Boyish sports in {%Vraja,%}
<div n="lb"/>charged with eating mud; lived with Nanda and his wife
<div n="lb"/>who were the same Droṇa and Dharā born as Nanda and
<div n="lb"/>Yaśodā by the command of Brahmā. When once Yaśodā
<div n="lb"/>left the churning pot to mind the boiling milk overflowing
<div n="lb"/>in the oven, Kṛṣṇa broke the curd pot and ran away with
<div n="lb"/>butter to feed a monkey. So he was bound with a rope to
<div n="lb"/>an {%ulūkhala%} (mortar) but the rope always fell two inches
[Page1-437+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>short in spite of bits being added. At last Kṛṣṇa pitied her
<div n="lb"/>and allowed himself to be tied; with the mortar he passed
<div n="lb"/>between two tall Arjuna trees, when down fell the trees,
<div n="lb"/>out of which emerged two men Nalakubera and Maṇigrīva
<div n="lb"/>(sons of Kubera) who had been cursed by Nārada. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>blessed them and sent them back to their abode.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Enjoyed the company of Gopis singing and dancing.
<div n="lb"/>Gifts on his {%janmanakṣatra%} day. Noticed a Daitya in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of a calf and taking him by the tail, he whirled him to death
<div n="lb"/>and flung the body on the top of a {%kapitha%} tree. On another
<div n="lb"/>occasion Asura Baka met him in the guise of a crane, when
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa tore its jaws asunder. Once when in the forest with
<div n="lb"/>his playmates, Agha, an asura friend of Kaṃsā took the form
<div n="lb"/>of a boa-constrictor with a view to devour the cattle and
<div n="lb"/>all boys together. All of them entered his open mouth with
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa who took his life out of his body and came out to
<div n="lb"/>the wonderment of gods. The {%ajāgara%} skin when dried was
<div n="lb"/>a cave for Vraja people. Agha, however, attained salva-
<div n="lb"/>tion.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>One day the boys sat and ate merrily when the cattle
<div n="lb"/>had gone far into the hill and dale and Kṛṣṇa promised to
<div n="lb"/>bring them back. In the meantime Brahmā had them hidden.
<div n="lb"/>So Kṛṣṇa created duplicates of the cattle and the children
<div n="lb"/>that had been lost. These went home as usual and this
<div n="lb"/>continued for a year, when Brahmā released the hidden cows
<div n="lb"/>which suckled their calves, and came to see the child, the
<div n="lb"/>one Brahman without a second, and belauded the baby
<div n="lb"/>Hari, and returned to his region. More boyhood sports.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>In regularly tending cows, imitated voice of beasts and
<div n="lb"/>birds in Brindāvana just like a rustic. Once the cattle
<div n="lb"/>drank of the poisonous waters of the Yamunā and became
<div n="lb"/>unconscious. After reviving them he found the reptile
<div n="lb"/>Kālīya in the waters. He immediately jumped into the pool
<div n="lb"/>and was enclosed in its coils. At this Nanda and the whole
<div n="lb"/>Vraja moved to the banks of the river with great concern.
[Page1-438+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Rāma advised them to be cool. Slowly Kṛṣṇa brought the
<div n="lb"/>reptile under his control, and getting on its hood, began to
<div n="lb"/>dance, when the Kālīya acknowledged defeat. Finding his
<div n="lb"/>end near, Kālīya's wives prayed to Kṛṣṇa to spare him. The
<div n="lb"/>generous Lord allowed him to make his abode in the sea,
<div n="lb"/>thus purifying the Yamunā once for all.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>After this incident the whole Vraja was encamped for
<div n="lb"/>the night in that vicinity. A forest fire attacked the camp,
<div n="lb"/>when Kṛṣṇa swallowed it and protected its inmates. His
<div n="lb"/>dances and songs; other past-times. Among the games was
<div n="lb"/>one in which the victor rode on the back of the vanquished.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa carried Śrīdāma on his back.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Once again the cattle went astray in the thick forest,
<div n="lb"/>and surrounded by fire they bellowed in thirst and hunger.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and his playmates found it impossible to reach the
<div n="lb"/>spot. So Kṛṣṇa got upon a tree and called the cattle by
<div n="lb"/>names, and they responded. Asking his followers to shut
<div n="lb"/>their eyes, he swallowed the forest fire. When they opened
<div n="lb"/>their eyes, they found themselves in their homes.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa filled Brindāvana with Gāndharvan music and
<div n="lb"/>played at times on flute. Hid the clothes of Gopis who
<div n="lb"/>observed {%Kātyāyani vrata%} to get him as their husband, and
<div n="lb"/>returned them only when they saluted with their two hands
<div n="lb"/>over their heads as a penance for bathing naked during the
<div n="lb"/>period of a {%vrata.%} It was a severe day in summer when
<div n="lb"/>some Gopas approached him for food. Kṛṣṇa advised them
<div n="lb"/>to go to the neighbouring {%yajñaśāla%} and ask for food, sing-
<div n="lb"/>ing the praises of Balarāma and himself. The sacrificers
<div n="lb"/>were silent at their request. Kṛṣṇa asked them to repeat
<div n="lb"/>their request to ladies in his name. The ladies took four
<div n="lb"/>kinds of food and in spite of protest by their male relations,
<div n="lb"/>they came to have {%darsan%} of the Lord and placed before Him
<div n="lb"/>all the eatables. On Kṛṣṇa's advice they went back to com-
<div n="lb"/>plete the sacrifice, and assured them of their being accepted
<div n="lb"/>by their relations and the world. Their male relations
[Page1-439+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>regretted having missed a chance of meeting the Lord. Then
<div n="lb"/>food was distributed among his friends.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa saw the Gopas worshipping Indra and as resi-
<div n="lb"/>dents of hills and forests, he suggested worship of mountains
<div n="lb"/>and cows. When this was accepted, Indra sent a heavy
<div n="lb"/>downpour which was warded off by Kṛṣṇa, a boy of seven,<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>holding up the Govardhana for a week. A visit from Indra
<div n="lb"/>and Surabhi who anointed him, Indra, of Goloka and gave
<div n="lb"/>him a new name Govinda. Rescued his father Nanda from
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa region and took him with other Gopas to Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>ḥrada where the Vedas were praising Hari. Once when
<div n="lb"/>playing on a flute, the Gopīs who were in the midst of house-
<div n="lb"/>hold duties stopped them and came to where he was in spite
<div n="lb"/>of protest from their male relations. Kṛṣṇa advised them
<div n="lb"/>to go back to Vraja and be loyal to their husbands. They
<div n="lb"/>refused to return as their minds were fixed upon him and
<div n="lb"/>longed for {%mokṣa,%} and insisted they were his {%dāsis%} and should
<div n="lb"/>be accepted. After some time he disappeared for their peace
<div n="lb"/>and redemption. They indulged in {%gītam,%} when the Lord
<div n="lb"/>appeared in their midst and shone like {%Puruṣa%} among {%śaktis.%}
<div n="lb"/>After consoling them he engaged them in a {%rāsakrīḍa,%} and
<div n="lb"/>finding them wearied, he engaged them in watersports and
<div n="lb"/>sports in the {%upavana%} on the river-bank. There was no
<div n="lb"/>carnal act of sin. The Lord who had no {%bandha,%} did all this
<div n="lb"/>in sport.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Released Nanda from a reptile who turned out to be
<div n="lb"/>vidyādhara Sudarśana. One day Śankhacūda a follower of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsā seized some ladies of Kṛṣṇa's party and ran away.
<div n="lb"/>They cried for succour. Kṛṣṇa and Rāma followed. He left the
<div n="lb"/>women behind and ran. Rāma took charge of the ladies
<div n="lb"/>while Kṛṣṇa pursued him, cut off his head and took the
<div n="lb"/>cūḍāmaṇi which he presented to Rāma. Killed Arīṣṭa in
<div n="lb"/>the form of a bull who entered the Vraja and terrified the
<div n="lb"/>inmates.<sup>19</sup>
[Page1-440+ 37]
<div n="P"/>Killed Keśin who came to the Vraja in the guise of a
<div n="lb"/>horse and became Keśava; killed one Vyoma in the guise of
<div n="lb"/>a gopāla; seen milking cows with Rāma by Akrūra who came
<div n="lb"/>to Dvārakā at the instance of Kaṃsā; agreed readily to start
<div n="lb"/>for Mathurā at Akrūra's message. With Akrūra, the two
<div n="lb"/>brothers arrived at Mathurā. and asked their friend to go
<div n="lb"/>home. He requested them to visit his house to which they
<div n="lb"/>agreed only after vanquishing Kaṃsā. Next day afternoon,
<div n="lb"/>the two brothers and their Gopa followers went round the
<div n="lb"/>city and the women from terraces enjoyed the sight of Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Rāma. On the way he met a washerman and asked
<div n="lb"/>for good clothes. On his refusal, he was killed, and all his
<div n="lb"/>clothes taken and distributed to his Gopas. Then they met
<div n="lb"/>a garland-maker Sudāma who voluntarily offered flower-
<div n="lb"/>garlands. Him he blessed and went. Next he saw a hunch-
<div n="lb"/>back woman carrying unguents to Kaṃsā. For the mere
<div n="lb"/>asking she offered the whole of it to them. So Kṛṣṇa con-
<div n="lb"/>verted her to a handsome lady who invited him to her house.
<div n="lb"/>This was agreed after finishing his work. Then they went
<div n="lb"/>through the bazaar and were rewarded with betels, sandal,
<div n="lb"/>etc., by merchants. Lastly they entered the place where
<div n="lb"/>the bow festival was held. Kṛṣṇa broke it easily. The
<div n="lb"/>guards who attacked them were put to death. It was
<div n="lb"/>evening when they returned to the camp outside the city.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>On his way to the wrestlers' arena, Kṛṣṇa vanquished
<div n="lb"/>Kuvalayāpīḍa with some effort. Taking its tusks, entered
<div n="lb"/>the enclosure with Balarāma. Accepted challenge from
<div n="lb"/>the wrestler Cānūra. The latter fell dead after fighting.
<div n="lb"/>The same fate met Śala and Tośalaka. Finding Kaṃsā
<div n="lb"/>ready to attack his relations, Kṛṣṇa overpowered him and
<div n="lb"/>killed him in a minute: condoled with the women of the
<div n="lb"/>dead and set his parents free; consoled his parents for their
<div n="lb"/>troubles and was embraced by them in love. Enthroned
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena, as Yadus could not sit on the throne owing to
<div n="lb"/>a curse of Yayāti. A regin of peace ushered in Mathurā.<sup>21</sup>
[Page1-441+ 38]
<div n="P"/>Nanda and Gopas were sent back to Vraja with
<div n="lb"/>honours. {%Upanayanam%} of Kṛṣṇa. With Balarāma Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to Sāndīpani and learnt all arts in 64 days. Hearing that
<div n="lb"/>Sāndīpani's son was washed away by the sea at Prabhāsā,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa went to the spot and was told by the seagod that an
<div n="lb"/>Asura Pañcajana carried him off. Then he went to Yama's
<div n="lb"/>abode, and recovering his son, handed him over to the {%guru%}
<div n="lb"/>as {%gurudakṣiṇa%} and came home. Requested Uddhava to go
<div n="lb"/>to Vraja with a message from him to Nanda and Gopis that
<div n="lb"/>he would be visiting them shortly. As promised he went
<div n="lb"/>to Sairandhri's house with Uddhava. It was decorated
<div n="lb"/>according to rules of Kāmaśāstra, and after a brief stay, left
<div n="lb"/>it for Akrūra's with Uddhava and Rāma. Akrūra extended
<div n="lb"/>a royal welcome. Kṛṣṇa praised him as their {%guru%} and
<div n="lb"/>requested him to go to Hāstinapur and find out the position
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas. Returned to their residence.<sup>22</sup> Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>heard of the siege of Mathurā by Jarāsandha and was devis-
<div n="lb"/>ing a plan of attack when two chariots descended from
<div n="lb"/>heaven fully armoured. Also {%Sudarśana,%} his {%cakra%} and
<div n="lb"/>other weapons came down to him and to Rāma. Rāma took
<div n="lb"/>a chariot and the {%hala%} (plough), but was considered by Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha as a boy and not his equal. Kṛṣṇa made defence
<div n="lb"/>arrangements at the four gates, and went out in his chariot
<div n="lb"/>of Garuda ensign by the northern gate to where Caidya and
<div n="lb"/>Māgadha were. Caidya's challenge and death; prevented
<div n="lb"/>Rāma from fettering Jarāsandha, and entered the city in
<div n="lb"/>victory and gave the spoils of war to Ugrasena, their king.
<div n="lb"/>Second and third defence of Mathurā. Prevented Kum-
<div n="lb"/>bhāṇḍa and Kūpakarṇa from using māyā in war by the
<div n="lb"/>application of {%vijñānāstra.%} Honoured after victory by the
<div n="lb"/>{%Sabhā%} of the Yadus.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>He next desired to see Gomanta and the hill fortress.
<div n="lb"/>Left with Rāma towards the south crossing the Yamunā, and
<div n="lb"/>many towns and villages. Saw on the way Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>engaged in austere {%tapas%} and bowed to him. Paraśurāma
[Page1-442+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>suggested killing Śrgālavāsudeva, a wicked chieftain of
<div n="lb"/>Karavīrapura at the foot of the Gomanta. When they
<div n="lb"/>reached the place, Śṛgālavāsudeva offered fight, and his
<div n="lb"/>head was cut off by Kṛṣṇa. Welcomed by the citizens of
<div n="lb"/>Karavīrapura, they spent there four months after sending
<div n="lb"/>the spoils of war to Mathurā. Got up the hill Gomanta
<div n="lb"/>where Garuḍa met Kṛṣṇa and placing his crown on his head,
<div n="lb"/>left. Reached Mathurā with a large army. Finding Yavana
<div n="lb"/>besieging the city and Jarāsandha leading the eighteenth
<div n="lb"/>expedition,, Kṛṣṇa in consultation with Rāma resolved to
<div n="lb"/>build a fortress of 12 yojanas in the sea to place their kith
<div n="lb"/>and kin in security. So a city was built according to {%Vāstu%}
<div n="lb"/>śāstra to which Indra sent {%Sudharmā%} and {%Pārijāta.%} Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>supplied horses and Kubera the eight {%Nidhis.%} It became a
<div n="lb"/>Yādava settlement. Attacked by (Kāla) Yavana, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>unarmed fled to the cave where Mucukunda was asleep.
<div n="lb"/>Here Yavana was burnt to ashes by Mucukunda's energy.
<div n="lb"/>Mucukunda's surprise to see Kṛṣṇa and his prayer for salva-
<div n="lb"/>tion. Kṛṣṇa spoke of his future birth as Brāhmaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>final salvation.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa returned to Ugrasena at Mathurā, raised the
<div n="lb"/>siege of Yavana troops and went to Dvārakā with his plunder.
<div n="lb"/>On the way Jarāsandha's army in {%makara vyūha%} attacked
<div n="lb"/>him but was broken by throwing a huge tree. Returned to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā with spoils of war left by Yavanas. Jarāsandha's
<div n="lb"/>attack again when Rāma and Kṛṣṇa fled to the Gomanta
<div n="lb"/>whose top crest was burnt, while Jarāsandha thought they
<div n="lb"/>were dead they reached Dvārakā safe.<sup>25</sup> Sent Kṛtavarṇa to
<div n="lb"/>ascertain from Hāstināpura whether Pāṇḍavas had defeated
<div n="lb"/>Drupada. Married Rukmiṇi by the {%Rākṣasa%} form of mar-
<div n="lb"/>riage, defeating Jarāsandha and others of the Caidya party
<div n="lb"/>in battle. Received with due honours the Brāhmaṇa mes-
<div n="lb"/>senger from Rukmiṇi and promised to do the needful. With
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa and Rāma, Kṛṣṇa drove from Ānartas to
<div n="lb"/>Vidarbhas in a night. Was honoured by Bhīṣmaka and
<div n="lb"/>allotted separate residence outside his capital. Ladies of
[Page1-443+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>Kuṇḍina said that Kṛṣṇa was suitable to Rukmiṇi. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇi returning from the Devi temple, he took her in his
<div n="lb"/>chariot in the midst of other kings and drove fast. Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha and others pursued but soon returned with dis-
<div n="lb"/>appointment. Rukmi's resolve to kill Kṛṣṇa and then
<div n="lb"/>enter Kuṇḍina. When he offered battle and was about
<div n="lb"/>to be killed, Rukmini appealed to the Lord to save her
<div n="lb"/>brother. At this he was tied to the chariot with his hair
<div n="lb"/>and moustache shaved. Advised by Rāma that punishment
<div n="lb"/>of Rukmī was not in order. Married Rukmiṇi according to
<div n="lb"/>{%Śāśtras%} amidst festivities in Dvārakā. Owing to Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>grace, got sacred sons of whom one was Pradyumna by Ruk-
<div n="lb"/>miṇī, being Kāma in a previous birth. Killed Sambara who
<div n="lb"/>stole the baby. Saw the lost Pradyumna and his wife Ratī
<div n="lb"/>in his residence, and hearing their account from Nārada,
<div n="lb"/>embraced the couple. Present at Pradyumna's marriage.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="P"/>Requested Satrājita to give the Syamantaka gem for
<div n="lb"/>their king but he refused. Suspected by Satrājita to be res-
<div n="lb"/>ponsible for his brother Prasena's disappearance in the
<div n="lb"/>forest; recovered the jewel from Jāmbavan after fight-
<div n="lb"/>ing for 28 days, and got also his daughter Jāmbavatī in
<div n="lb"/>marriage. The jewel was returned to Satrājita in the public
<div n="lb"/>assembly. Married Satrājita's daughter Satyabhāmā, and
<div n="lb"/>when the jewel was offered, it was returned. Went with
<div n="lb"/>Rāma to the Kurus after the rumoured death of the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas and Kunti; met the Pāṇḍavas at Pāñcāla city in the
<div n="lb"/>guise of Brāhmaṇas; killed Śatadhanvan, the murderer of
<div n="lb"/>his father-in-law Satrājita. Sent for Akrūra and asked him
<div n="lb"/>to exhibit Syamantaka in his possession, and returned it
<div n="lb"/>to him afterwards.<sup>27</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa once went to Hāstināpura to see the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and was heartily welcomed. Paid respects to Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>and Bhīma, embraced Arjuna and received respects from
<div n="lb"/>Nakula and Sahadeva. Kuntī welcomed him also. When
<div n="lb"/>he was spending that winter there, he went to the forest
[Page1-444+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>with Arjuna for hunting and there met an accomplished lady
<div n="lb"/>when Arjuna addressed. Hearing that she was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of the Sun waiting to marry Kṛṣṇa, the latter took
<div n="lb"/>her home. In the meantime Kṛṣṇa asked Viśvakarmā to
<div n="lb"/>build a city for the Pāṇḍavas. Acting as Arjuna's charioteer,
<div n="lb"/>he caused the Khāṇḍava forest to be given over to fire.
<div n="lb"/>Returned to Dvārakā and married Kālindī, Sun's daughter.
<div n="lb"/>Then he married Mitravindā of Avanti, an aunt's daughter.
<div n="lb"/>Received Satyā, daughter of Nagnajit of Ayodhyā by curb-
<div n="lb"/>ing the ferocity of seven bulls, with a large dowry of chariots,
<div n="lb"/>elephants and treasure. Jealous kings were driven away
<div n="lb"/>by Arjuna. Married another aunt's daughter Bhadrā.
<div n="lb"/>Took Lakṣmaṇā, daughter of the Madra king and thousands
<div n="lb"/>of maidens from Naraka's harem.<sup>28</sup>
<div n="P"/>Indra came one day to Dvārakā and reported to Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>the mischief done to him by Naraka. Entering Prāgjyotiṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa pulled down ramparts and walls and cut off Mura's
<div n="lb"/>five heads. His seven sons attacked him led by Pāṭha in
<div n="lb"/>vain. Naraka also attacked and had his head cut off. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>entered the city welcomed by its people, saw Maṇiparvata
<div n="lb"/>of Indra and the umbrella of Varuṇa and gave them back
<div n="lb"/>to them. Earth, mother of Naraka came before Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>handed over the {%kuṇḍalas%} of Aditi, informing him that
<div n="lb"/>Naraka was her son by the touch of Hari in Vārāha form.
<div n="lb"/>Then he entered the harem of the Asura and sent away
<div n="lb"/>16000 (some 16100) maidens to Dvārakā and them he
<div n="lb"/>married, after distributing the spoils of war among his fellow
<div n="lb"/>companions.<sup>29</sup> Had by his wives 18000 sons.
<div n="P"/>With Satyabhāmā he visited Indra's abode and after
<div n="lb"/>giving the {%kuṇḍalas%} to Aditi, he came back with {%Pārijāta%}
<div n="lb"/>against Indra's will, because his queen wanted it. He
<div n="lb"/>enjoyed the company of all his wives, taking a separate form
<div n="lb"/>for each wife. Indra's attack on Kṛṣṇa with gods like
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, Vāyu, etc., for taking away {%Pārijāta.%} Their defeat
<div n="lb"/>and Indra's apology. Kṛṣṇa consoled him. Welcomed back
<div n="lb"/>in Dvārakā.<sup>30</sup>
[Page1-445+ 37]
<div n="P"/>Love quarrel with his consort Rukmiṇī described. Once
<div n="lb"/>when Kṛṣṇa was sitting at leisure, Rukmiṇi who was nearby
<div n="lb"/>fanned him. Kṛṣṇa indulged in fun and asked her how she
<div n="lb"/>chose a poor fellow like him leaving princes of equal status
<div n="lb"/>with her, and added that he was willing to let her go and
<div n="lb"/>marry a powerful Kṣatriya prince. This put out poor Ruk-
<div n="lb"/>miṇi who wept bitterly, speaking words showing her
<div n="lb"/>unflinching loyalty to him. Noticing her sincerity Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>consoled her that he simply cut a joke. He said that she
<div n="lb"/>knew him to be Hari to whom Rājaṛṣis like Aṅga, Nahuṣa
<div n="lb"/>and Gaya had dedicated their lives leaving their kingdoms,
<div n="lb"/>and that Brahmā and Śiva sang his praises. Kṛṣṇa assured
<div n="lb"/>her of his loyalty to her. In this way he led a household
<div n="lb"/>life just like an ordinary mortal. Each one of his eight chief
<div n="lb"/>queens gave birth to ten sons, and each thought that Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was only living with her, as there was a Kṛṣṇa by the side
<div n="lb"/>of each lady including the 16000 of Naraka's harem. He
<div n="lb"/>played with them blindman's buff, exchanging betels, scents,
<div n="lb"/>etc. The chief queens were Rukmini, Satyabhāmā, Jāmba-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, Satyā, Kālindī, Mādri, Mitravindā, and Bhadrā.
<div n="lb"/>Attended Aniruddha's marriage with Rocanā at Bhojakaṭa.
<div n="lb"/>Heard from Nārada of Aniruddha's imprisonment by Bāṇa
<div n="lb"/>of 1000 arms and besieged Śonitapura. Defeated Śiva who
<div n="lb"/>came on Bāṇā's behalf and at Śiva's request, let Bāṇa go
<div n="lb"/>with his four arms remaining. Returned to Dvārakā with
<div n="lb"/>Aniruddha and Uṣā.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard from a Brāhmaṇa of the externment of Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas to the forest, and riding on a chariot with Satyabhāmā,
<div n="lb"/>met them and consoled them; came back with Subhadrā and
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu. Heard a report of a huge lizard in a well, and
<div n="lb"/>lifting it up, he found it to be a divinity who revealed him-
<div n="lb"/>self as king Nṛga and who went to heaven. Taught the
<div n="lb"/>citizens of Dvāraka on the inviolability of Brāhmaṇas’
<div n="lb"/>property.<sup>32</sup>
[Page1-446+ 37]
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa heard of Pauṇḍraka's invasion of Dvārakā in his
<div n="lb"/>absence. Had a message from him either to give up the title
<div n="lb"/>of Vāsudeva or offer battle. Ugrasena and others laughed
<div n="lb"/>at this. Kṛṣṇa went to Kāśī and had the heads of Pauṇḍraka
<div n="lb"/>and his ally cut off and their army destroyed. Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>return to Dvāraka. An {%ābhicāra%} Agni was sent by Pauṇḍ-
<div n="lb"/>raka's son through the grace of Śiva but was vanquished by
<div n="lb"/>Hari's {%cakra.%} By his {%yoga%} power Kṛṣṇa appeared at the
<div n="lb"/>mansions of each of his 16000 wives, engaged in a normal
<div n="lb"/>domestic life. When Nārada entered every house, he saw
<div n="lb"/>the same Kṛṣṇa in each; got up early in the morning and
<div n="lb"/>meditated on Brahman; gave cows, etc., to the Brāhmaṇas,
<div n="lb"/>saw first ghee, then mirror, cows, gods, etc. Heard from a
<div n="lb"/>messenger of the difficulties of kings imprisoned by Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha. Advised by Uddhava to vanquish Jarāsandha with
<div n="lb"/>the aid of Bhīma at Yudhiṣṭhira's {%Rājasūya.%} Kṛṣṇa's route
<div n="lb"/>to Hāstināpura where he was received by the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>Draupadī welcomed his wives and, these were put up com-
<div n="lb"/>fortably. Hearing Jarāsandha still unconquered, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>with Bhīma and Arjuna went to Girivraja in Brāhmaṇas’
<div n="lb"/>disguise and asked for meals. They then threw off their
<div n="lb"/>disguise and called him to battle in which Bhīma won.
<div n="lb"/>After releasing prisoners, Kṛṣṇa enthroned Sahadeva, son
<div n="lb"/>of Jarāsandha.<sup>33</sup> The kings thus released after the fall of
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha were 20800, praised the Lord and requested that
<div n="lb"/>they might ever remember Him. Kṛṣṇa asked them to go
<div n="lb"/>back to their places and assume charge of governments by
<div n="lb"/>ruling righteously. Sahadeva arranged their bath, dress
<div n="lb"/>and meals, after which they left for where Yudhiṣṭhira and
<div n="lb"/>his family were. Received the first honour in the {%Rājasūya%}
<div n="lb"/>of Yudhiṣṭhira when Śiśupāla protested in a vilifying speech.
<div n="lb"/>His head was cut off. Lived in Hāstināpura for some months
<div n="lb"/>at the request of Yudhiṣṭhīra and others. Attended to {%arghya%}
<div n="lb"/>and {%pādya%} for Brāhmaṇas in the {%Rājasūya.%} Welcomed
<div n="lb"/>Nārada who informed him of the necessity of vanquishing
<div n="lb"/>Śālva. Left for Dvārakā hearing of its blockade by Śālva
[Page1-447+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>who applied illusory powers. Kṛṣṇa broke his car and killed
<div n="lb"/>him.
<div n="P"/>Kṛṣṇa went as an ambassador of the Pāṇḍavas to Dur-
<div n="lb"/>yodhana. He was sought to be made prisoner in vain; came
<div n="lb"/>back determined to declare war. In the war served as
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna's charioteer, and after the war Kṛṣṇa condoled with
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra and after anointing Yudhiṣṭhīra, returned to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā.
<div n="P"/>One day there came Kucaila, a Brāhmaṇa classmate of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, a poor man with many children. Induced by his
<div n="lb"/>wife he visited Kṛṣṇa who welcomed him with Rukmiṇi,
<div n="lb"/>indulged in talks of old school days, partook of the {%pṛthuka%}
<div n="lb"/>rice which Kucaila's wife had sent, and sent him away after
<div n="lb"/>keeping him for a night.<sup>34</sup>
<div n="P"/>Left for Syamantapañcaka for solar eclipse, met Gopis
<div n="lb"/>there and taught them the nature of the Absolute. Sages
<div n="lb"/>waited on him and praised his glory. His joy at Vasudeva's
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. Honoured Nanda. Praised by his father, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>replied that Ātma is only one. At the request of Devakī
<div n="lb"/>to get back all her sons killed by Kamsā, Kṛṣṇa entered
<div n="lb"/>Sutalam and with leave of Bali, took them to his mother who
<div n="lb"/>embraced them in affection. These children who were
<div n="lb"/>degraded gods gained their old form and went to heaven.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>Subhadrā was his sister, and Arjuna carried her off with
<div n="lb"/>his knowledge and against the wish of Balarāma. He went
<div n="lb"/>with sages to Mithilā where was his Brāhmaṇa devotee Śru-
<div n="lb"/>tadeva. The latter and the king Maithilā welcomed him and
<div n="lb"/>requested him to stay. Kṛṣṇa did not like to disoblige them
<div n="lb"/>and so stayed in both houses taking two different forms, thus
<div n="lb"/>purifying Nimi line, and pleasing Śrutadeva.<sup>36</sup>
<div n="P"/>Performed {%Aśvamedha%} sacrifice in the course of which
<div n="lb"/>he had to go to Vaikuṇṭha with Arjuna to recover the lost
<div n="lb"/>children of a Dvārakā Brāhmaṇa who preferred a complaint.
<div n="lb"/>After return with the lost boy, he had his {%avabhṛta%} cele-
[Page1-448+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>brated in the Yamunā. Then he continued his righteous
<div n="lb"/>rule and spent a good time in Dvārakā enjoying pleasures
<div n="lb"/>with his chosen wives.<sup>37</sup>
<div n="P"/>His service to the world was to kill Daityas and relieve
<div n="lb"/>the burden of the Earth. Resolved to destroy the Yadu race
<div n="lb"/>and reach his eternal abode; approved of the curse of the
<div n="lb"/>sages against the Yadu race. Brahmā and other gods visited
<div n="lb"/>him, appealing to him to go back to Vaikuṇṭha. He agreed.
<div n="lb"/>Uddhava expressed a wish to follow him but was advised by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa to lead a righteous life. Incidentally Kṛṣṇa narrated
<div n="lb"/>to him the conversation of a certain Avadhūta and Yadu.
<div n="lb"/>Insisting on {%yama%} and {%niyama,%} and duties incumbent on
<div n="lb"/>{%varṇa%} and {%āśrama.%} Then he described who was said to be
<div n="lb"/>in bondage, who was a free man and a righteous person, and
<div n="lb"/>he also explained the need and importance of {%Satsanga.%} He
<div n="lb"/>proceeded to instruct Uddhava on the nature of the {%guṇas,%}
<div n="lb"/>and their causes, laying emphasis on {%satva guṇa.%} Then he
<div n="lb"/>explained {%Bhakti, Dhyāna, siddhis%} and their nature. He
<div n="lb"/>afterwards narrated the {%Vibhūtis%} of Hari, described the
<div n="lb"/>dharmas of {%varṇa%} and {%āśrama,%} explained what was {%jñāna%}
<div n="lb"/>and {%vijñāna,%} giving a list of duties to be observed by all. He
<div n="lb"/>further instructed on the three {%yogas — jñāna, karma%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%bhakti,%} on the Vedas, and on the principles of {%Sāṅkhya%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%Sāṅkhyavidhi.%} He then narrated the story of an Avanti
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa who turned out ascetic after being a miser. He
<div n="lb"/>enumerated the different characteristics of the three {%guṇas%}
<div n="lb"/>and the evil effects of bad association, recapitulating {%kriyā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%yoga, jñāna yoga and bhakti yoga.%} Lastly Uddhava was
<div n="lb"/>advised to go to Badari.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>Advised his relations to go to Prabhāsa, and there
<div n="lb"/>deluded by him, they fought among themselves and died.
<div n="lb"/>Balarāma also met his death. Kṛṣṇa heard this while sit-
<div n="lb"/>ting under a {%pippala%} tree. A hunter Jarā by name aimed
<div n="lb"/>his shaft at his foot little thinking that it was the Lord.
<div n="lb"/>Coming to know that it was Kṛṣṇa he regretted much.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa consoled him and permitted him to go to Heaven.
[Page1-449+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa addressed his charioteer Dāmaka to go to Dvārakā, and
<div n="lb"/>advise the people there to leave for Hastinapura with
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. Invited by gods Kṛṣṇa entered his {%dhāma,%} while
<div n="lb"/>his wives entered fire.<sup>39</sup> It was the first day of Kali yuga.<sup>39a</sup>

<div n="lb"/>ed Arjuna to overcome the arrow Brahmaśiras of Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>thāma; advised him to accept Draupadi's plea to release him

<div n="lb"/>and party to attend the funeral rites of her sons, on the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges; anointed Yudhiṣṭhira on the throne.
