{%Kucaila%}¦ — a poor Brāhmaṇa and class-mate of Kṛṣṇa.
Having many children and distressed by poverty, his wife
advised him to meet Kṛṣṇa. She begged some {%Pṛthukataṇ-%}
{%ḍula,%} and sent it as present to Kṛṣṇa. When he came to
Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa recognised him and entertained him. Ruk-
miṇī also honoured him. Kṛṣṇa recalled their school days,
and their loyalty to Guru Sāndīpani, and how he recipro-
cated it. Once when they went out and were caught in
storm and rains, the Guru came in search of them with
great anxiety. Kucaila gave Kṛṣṇa the {%Pṛthukataṇḍula%}
which Kṛṣṇa shared with Rukminī and heartily ate of it.
After spending a jolly night, the Brāhmaṇa took leave of
his friend and went home, ruminating on the way why
Kṛṣṇa did not offer any riches to him. When he neared his
place, he found tall mansions lavishly built and furnished.
His wife extended him welcome with servants. He knew
it was all the work of his friend Kṛṣṇa. Spent a righteous
life ever meditating on Hari's lotus feet.
