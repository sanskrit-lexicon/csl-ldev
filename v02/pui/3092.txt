{%Kucaila%}¦ — a poor Brāhmaṇa and class-mate of Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Having many children and distressed by poverty, his wife
<div n="lb"/>advised him to meet Kṛṣṇa. She begged some {%Pṛthukataṇ-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ḍula,%} and sent it as present to Kṛṣṇa. When he came to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa recognised him and entertained him. Ruk-
<div n="lb"/>miṇī also honoured him. Kṛṣṇa recalled their school days,
<div n="lb"/>and their loyalty to Guru Sāndīpani, and how he recipro-
<div n="lb"/>cated it. Once when they went out and were caught in
<div n="lb"/>storm and rains, the Guru came in search of them with
<div n="lb"/>great anxiety. Kucaila gave Kṛṣṇa the {%Pṛthukataṇḍula%}
<div n="lb"/>which Kṛṣṇa shared with Rukminī and heartily ate of it.
<div n="lb"/>After spending a jolly night, the Brāhmaṇa took leave of
<div n="lb"/>his friend and went home, ruminating on the way why
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa did not offer any riches to him. When he neared his
<div n="lb"/>place, he found tall mansions lavishly built and furnished.
<div n="lb"/>His wife extended him welcome with servants. He knew
<div n="lb"/>it was all the work of his friend Kṛṣṇa. Spent a righteous
<div n="lb"/>life ever meditating on Hari's lotus feet.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 80. 6-45; 81 (whole).
