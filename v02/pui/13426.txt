{%Vṛka%} (VII)¦ — a son of Śakuni and an Asura; met Nārada
<div n="lb"/>who advised him to perform tapas in honour of Śiva. He
<div n="lb"/>did so by cutting his own flesh for six days and on the seventh
<div n="lb"/>was about to cut off his head when Śiva appeared and blessed
<div n="lb"/>that whosesoever head he touched that person should die. He
<div n="lb"/>attempted it on Śiva who ran to Vaikuṇṭha. Hari in the
<div n="lb"/>form of a Brahmacārin asked him to try the boon on him-
<div n="lb"/>self. The wicked Asura did so and met with his death.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 88. 13-36.
