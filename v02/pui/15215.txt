{%Satyavrata%} (III)¦ — a son of Trayyāruṇi (Trayyāmuṇa-
<div n="lb"/>{%M. P.%}) who took to wife Vidarbha's queen; for this un-
<div n="lb"/>righteousness he was banished by his father to live with
<div n="lb"/>Śvāpakas; when his father went to the forest there was no
<div n="lb"/>shower for 12 years when Satyavrata performed austeri-
<div n="lb"/>ties and helped the sons and wives of Viśvāmitra in their
<div n="lb"/>livelihood; Vasiṣṭha was in charge of the kingdom and did
<div n="lb"/>not invite him; enraged at this he killed his cow and fed
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra's family; Viśvāmitra noticed three departures
<div n="lb"/>from dharma and called him Triśaṅku; Viśvāmitra was
<div n="lb"/>pleased with his aid and took him to heaven with his earthly
<div n="lb"/>body to the wonder of even Vasiṣṭha; his wife was Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vratā and son Hariścandra.
