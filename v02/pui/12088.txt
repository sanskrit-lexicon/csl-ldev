{%Vajra%} (III)¦ — a thief of Kāñcī stole bit by bit from the
<div n="lb"/>city and stored the riches in a secret place in the neighbour-
<div n="lb"/>ing woods. A certain kirāta gathering fuel for sale observed
<div n="lb"/>this once and took a portion of the property home. His
<div n="lb"/>wife, charitably disposed, wanted to utilise it for digging
[Page3-137+ 29]
<div n="lb"/>wells and ponds. So a pond was constructed but before it was
<div n="lb"/>completed, all money had been spent. He got more of the
<div n="lb"/>thief's wealth and completed the embankment; built temples
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva and Viṣṇu, besides giving gifts to Brāhmaṇas who
<div n="lb"/>were pleased and renamed him and his wife as Dvijavarma
<div n="lb"/>and Śīlāvatī: He also built a town and named it after his
<div n="lb"/>Purohita, Devarāta. At his death, as he built all out of
<div n="lb"/>stolen wealth Nārada ruled that he should wander in air
<div n="lb"/>for 12 years, while his wife went to Brahmaloka. As she
<div n="lb"/>refused, she was advised to recite {%Śatarudra%} and get her
<div n="lb"/>husband released from the sin of theft. When Vajra died
<div n="lb"/>he got half of Dvijavarman's virtue. Dvijavarman attained
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa.
<div n="P"/>Br. IV. 7. 10-61.
