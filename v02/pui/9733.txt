{%Bhūtāni%}¦ — three-fold movements; {%naimittika, prākṛtika,%}
and {%ātyantika; naimittika%} is Brahmā; in the dissolution of

up from his sleep; during his sleep there is no continuous
rain; rivers are with little or no waters; the sun's seven rays
scorch the earth and draw away even the little water; every-
thing is burnt down; no trees or plants; the heat penetrates
the {%Pātāla%} and the {%Vāyu lokas;%} all the worlds are burnt
down; everywhere is to be seen one flame of fire; then set in
clouds in different hues and in different shapes, pour down
rains and appease the fire which enters into waters, result-
ing in the condition of {%ekārṇava%} out of which emerges
Brahmā, the first progenitor and {%Puruṣa;%} the seven sages see
him; then, are gradually born all the kings one by one; simi-
larly sages, men, gods and other things.
