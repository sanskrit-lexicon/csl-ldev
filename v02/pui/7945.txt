{%Pītavāsās%}¦ — the 31st Kalpa; Brahmā attained pīta
colour; a son of that colour came out of his contemplation;
even the Yajñopavīta was of that colour; from his medita-
tion of Maheśvarī, Brahmā saw Gāand Virūpa dropping out
of the mouth of Maheśvara with four feet, four faces, four
hands, four breasts, four eyes, etc. She was Rudrāṇi sur-
rounded by sons who lived for 1000 years for the welfare
of the Brahmanas and attained Rudrahood.
