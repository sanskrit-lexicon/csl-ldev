{%Agha%}¦ — an asura; friend of Kaṃsa. Appeared in the
<div n="lb"/>guise of a boa-constrictor in order to devour Kṛṣṇa, his play-
<div n="lb"/>mates and cattle in Bṛndāvana. Thinking it to be a part of
<div n="lb"/>the landscape of the Bṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa's playmates and
<div n="lb"/>cattle entered his wide-open mouth. Kṛṣṇa understood the
<div n="lb"/>situation, and after a little hesitation, he also went in and
<div n="lb"/>killed him by choking his throat. Agha, however, attained
<div n="lb"/>salvation.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 12. 13-38; 13. 4; 14. 60.
