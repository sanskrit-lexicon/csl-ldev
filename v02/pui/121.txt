{%Agha%}¦ — an asura; friend of Kaṃsa. Appeared in the
guise of a boa-constrictor in order to devour Kṛṣṇa, his play-
mates and cattle in Bṛndāvana. Thinking it to be a part of
the landscape of the Bṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa's playmates and
cattle entered his wide-open mouth. Kṛṣṇa understood the
situation, and after a little hesitation, he also went in and
killed him by choking his throat. Agha, however, attained
salvation.
