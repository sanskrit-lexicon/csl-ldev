{%Śarmiṣṭhā%} (I)¦ — a daughter of Vṛṣaparvan (hence
<div n="lb"/>Vārṣaparvaṇi-{%Vi. P.%}) and wife of Yayāti. She once went
<div n="lb"/>with her attendants and Devayānī, and became engaged in
<div n="lb"/>water sports. Śiva and Pārvatī passed them when they put
<div n="lb"/>on their dress. In doing so Śarmiṣṭhā put on Devayānī's dress
<div n="lb"/>by mistake and was taken to task by Devayānī who called
[Page3-391+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>her a slave, arrogating superiority as a Brahmana girl.
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā grew angry and stripping her of her clothes threw
<div n="lb"/>her into a well and returned home;<sup>1</sup> Śukra resented the action
<div n="lb"/>of the princess and left the palace though the king begged
<div n="lb"/>his pardon. Śukra agreed to stay on condition that
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā would follow Devayānī wherever she went. It
<div n="lb"/>was agreed. She was given to Yayāti when Devayānī was
<div n="lb"/>married to him. Yayāti advised not to share his
<div n="lb"/>bed with Śarmiṣṭhā. One day after her monthly period
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā requested him to embrace her, which he
<div n="lb"/>did. She became mother of three sons — Druhya, Anu and
<div n="lb"/>Pūru.<sup>2</sup>
