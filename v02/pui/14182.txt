{%Śarmiṣṭhā%} (I)¦ — a daughter of Vṛṣaparvan (hence
Vārṣaparvaṇi-{%Vi. P.%}) and wife of Yayāti. She once went
with her attendants and Devayānī, and became engaged in
water sports. Śiva and Pārvatī passed them when they put
on their dress. In doing so Śarmiṣṭhā put on Devayānī's dress
by mistake and was taken to task by Devayānī who called
[Page3-391+ 36]
her a slave, arrogating superiority as a Brahmana girl.
Śarmiṣṭhā grew angry and stripping her of her clothes threw
her into a well and returned home;<sup>1</sup> Śukra resented the action
of the princess and left the palace though the king begged
his pardon. Śukra agreed to stay on condition that
Śarmiṣṭhā would follow Devayānī wherever she went. It
was agreed. She was given to Yayāti when Devayānī was
married to him. Yayāti advised not to share his
bed with Śarmiṣṭhā. One day after her monthly period
Śarmiṣṭhā requested him to embrace her, which he
did. She became mother of three sons — Druhya, Anu and
Pūru.<sup>2</sup>
