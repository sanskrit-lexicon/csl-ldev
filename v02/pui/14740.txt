{%Śeṣa%} (II)¦ — (Ananta): a tāmasa form of Viṣṇu down
below the Pātāla regions; with 1000 jewelled heads, purple
garment, white necklace; in his hands are the plough and
mace; worshipped by Lakṣmī and Vāruṇī; when the deluge
sets in, he vomits venomed fire devouring the three worlds;
Nāga maids adorn him with fragrant sandal paste; celestials
and Asuras worship him; Gangā worshipped him and learnt
from him astronomy and astrology; supports the whole earth
with his head;<sup>1</sup> the best of Nāgas;<sup>2</sup> is Balarāma.<sup>3</sup>
