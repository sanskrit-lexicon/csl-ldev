{%Kardama%} (I)¦ — father of Kapīla. Married Devahūti.<sup>1</sup>
A son of Brahmā born of his shadow. A progenitor and a
{%yogi;%}<sup>2</sup> performed in {%Kṛtayuga%} austerities on the banks of
Sarasvatī for 10,000 years; when Hari appeared before him,
he praised Him and asked for a suitable wife. Devahūti
was suggested and the Lord disappeared. Manu came with
his wife and daughter to his hermitage, and was suitably
received. Kardama agreed to marry his daughter and lead
a householder's life until the birth of children. After wed-
ding, Manu and his wife returned home. Pleased at his
wife's devotion, created an aerial car artistically built and
furnished. Took his wife after her bath and dress round
the earth for a hundred years. Nine daughters were born
when according to original contract he was anxious to leave
her for woods to practise {%yoga.%} Noticing her anxiety at his
departure, he consoled her that she would give birth to Hari
who would bring solace to her. On the birth of Kapila,
Brahmā and other seers called on him; gave his daughters
in marriage, took leave of his son and retired to a life of
penance.
