<div n="lb"/>{%yogi;%}<sup>2</sup> performed in {%Kṛtayuga%} austerities on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī for 10,000 years; when Hari appeared before him,
<div n="lb"/>he praised Him and asked for a suitable wife. Devahūti
<div n="lb"/>was suggested and the Lord disappeared. Manu came with
<div n="lb"/>his wife and daughter to his hermitage, and was suitably
<div n="lb"/>received. Kardama agreed to marry his daughter and lead
<div n="lb"/>a householder's life until the birth of children. After wed-
<div n="lb"/>ding, Manu and his wife returned home. Pleased at his
<div n="lb"/>wife's devotion, created an aerial car artistically built and

<div n="lb"/>the earth for a hundred years. Nine daughters were born
<div n="lb"/>when according to original contract he was anxious to leave
<div n="lb"/>her for woods to practise {%yoga.%} Noticing her anxiety at his
<div n="lb"/>departure, he consoled her that she would give birth to Hari
<div n="lb"/>who would bring solace to her. On the birth of Kapila,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and other seers called on him; gave his daughters
<div n="lb"/>in marriage, took leave of his son and retired to a life of
<div n="lb"/>penance.
