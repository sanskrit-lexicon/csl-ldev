{%Govinda%} (I)¦ — the name given to Kṛṣṇa by Indra the
lord of Gokula;<sup>1</sup> the Yādava king; went in search
of {%maṇi%} by tracing the steps of Prasenajit when he
was supposed to have killed him for the sake of
the jewel, and came upon a place where Prasena and
his horses were dead; proceeding he saw a dead lion
and further a cave of a bear in the Vindhyas and heard
the talk of a muse fondling the son of the bear; overhearing
he heard: “dont cry„ Syamantaka is yours”. Then he
entered the mouth of the cave and saw Jāmbavān, the king
of bears; had hand-to-hand fight for 21 days; the followers
of Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvāravatī and spread the news that
Kṛṣṇa was dead; defeating the bear he got the hand of his
daughter Jāmbavatī with the {%maṇi%} and returned home; gave
it to Śakrajit in an assembly.<sup>2</sup>
