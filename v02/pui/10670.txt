{%Māyāvatī%}¦ — Rati in her former birth: when her hus-
band was burnt by {%Śiva,%} she was reborn as the superinten-
dent of Śambara's kitchen. Hearing from Nārada that
Pradyumna was Kāma and that he was thrown into sea by
Śambara and swallowed by a fish and was brought to her
kitchen, she nursed him lovingly and when he came of age,
she spoke the truth and taught him {%mahāmāyā vidyā%} with
which he killed Śambara: She took him by air to Kṛṣṇa
and was rejoiced to become the daughter-in-law of Kṛṣṇa
and Rukmiṇī.
