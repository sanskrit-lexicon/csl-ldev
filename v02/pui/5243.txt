{%Jvālā%} (II)¦ — after the conquest of the three worlds by
Viṣṇu, the Devas, including Brahmā praised him; Brahmā
was the creator while Viṣṇu was the creator and destroyer
of worlds; during their discussion there was a {%jvālā%} in the
north which spread over all the worlds out of which came
Linga which went on growing. To see its beginning and
end both agreed to go above and below respectively; they
went on for 1000 years; it was beyond reckoning; hence both
praised Śiva for light; Śiva said that Brahmā was the right
hand and Viṣṇu his left hand and disappeared.
