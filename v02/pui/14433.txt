{%Śilā%} (III)¦ — Dharmavratā, the daughter of Dharma and
Viśvarūpa married Marīci; when she was once serving
her husband in sleep Brahmā came there and she honoured
him leaving her husband; the latter awoke and cursed her
to become a stone as she did not do the duty of a wife pro-
perly; she became furious and cursed her husband and her-
self performed severe austerities in the midst of a blazing
fire; pleased with her, Viṣṇu asked her to take a few boons
adding that her husband's curse could not be changed; she
then requested that she might live in the shape of a stone
at Gayā {%tīrtha%} on which all Devas should reside; the
request was granted.
