{%Śilā%} (III)¦ — Dharmavratā, the daughter of Dharma and
<div n="lb"/>Viśvarūpa married Marīci; when she was once serving
<div n="lb"/>her husband in sleep Brahmā came there and she honoured
<div n="lb"/>him leaving her husband; the latter awoke and cursed her
<div n="lb"/>to become a stone as she did not do the duty of a wife pro-
<div n="lb"/>perly; she became furious and cursed her husband and her-
<div n="lb"/>self performed severe austerities in the midst of a blazing
<div n="lb"/>fire; pleased with her, Viṣṇu asked her to take a few boons
<div n="lb"/>adding that her husband's curse could not be changed; she
<div n="lb"/>then requested that she might live in the shape of a stone
<div n="lb"/>at Gayā {%tīrtha%} on which all Devas should reside; the
<div n="lb"/>request was granted.
<div n="P"/>Vā. 107. (whole); 108. 2; 109. 33, 46, 51; 112. 30 and 41.
