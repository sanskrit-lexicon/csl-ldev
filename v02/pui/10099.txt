{%Manu%}¦ (XII) {%(Svāyambhuva)%} — the first son of Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and the first king (Samrāṭ) also Virāṭ. Ruled the earth,
<div n="lb"/>girt by seven seas, occupying Brahmāvarta with Barhiṣmatī
<div n="lb"/>as capital. A Viprarājaṛṣi. Learnt the Veda from his father,
<div n="lb"/>who asked him to rule according to Dharma. Wife Śata-
<div n="lb"/>rūpā; sons Priyavrata and Uttānapāda besides eight more
<div n="lb"/>through Anantā and a daughter, Devahūtī. Other daughters
<div n="lb"/>were Ākūti and Prasūti<sup>1</sup> who married Dakṣa and Ruci res-
<div n="lb"/>pectively. Met Kardama on the Sarasvatī, spoke of inter-
<div n="lb"/>dependence of the Kṣatriya and the Brahmana, and offered
<div n="lb"/>his daughter Devahūtī in marriage to that sage.<sup>2</sup> Another
<div n="lb"/>daughter Dhanyā became the wife of Dhruva. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva fighting with the Yakṣas in utter wrath, Manu asked
<div n="lb"/>him to cease slaughtering the innocents and to ask pardon
<div n="lb"/>of Kubera, their chief.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Appointed Priyavrata in charge of the kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>retired to {%tapas.%} Spent 71 yugas meditating on Viṣṇu, and
<div n="lb"/>gave Him the name, Hari. Did not take objection to Hara's
<div n="lb"/>violation of {%dharma,%} though he was one of the twelve who
<div n="lb"/>knew the {%dharma%} ordained by Hari.<sup>4</sup> Served as calf for
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu to milk the earth.<sup>5</sup> Formed one half of the Creator
[Page2-620+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>and the other was Śatarūpā. Asked Brahmā for the earth
<div n="lb"/>being lifted out of the waters to form an abode for him and
<div n="lb"/>his subjects, when a Varāha issued from Brahmā's nostrils
<div n="lb"/>to do the work.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Renouncing the world, Manu stood on one leg medi-
<div n="lb"/>tating on the glory of Hari on the bank of the Sunandā for
<div n="lb"/>a hundred years; when the Asuras tried to attack and devour
<div n="lb"/>him, Hari in the form of {%yajña%} slew them.<sup>7</sup> The first to give
<div n="lb"/>out {%Smārta dharma, Varṇāśrama dharma%} and the first to
<div n="lb"/>practice {%śiṣṭācāra;%} requested by Brahma to protect the
<div n="lb"/>{%Vedas%} and consequently the {%yajñas.%} Divided the Vedas into
<div n="lb"/>four sections.<sup>8</sup> An Ādipuruṣa. From him were born
<div n="lb"/>Vairājas.<sup>9</sup>
