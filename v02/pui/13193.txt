{%Viśvakarmā%} (III)¦ — divided the earth into seven islands,
<div n="lb"/>oceans and hills, {%Bhūḥ%} and other worlds; created the people
<div n="lb"/>as in the previous kalpas; but the whole was clouded in
<div n="lb"/>smoke, in five forms like a light enveloped by a pot; finding
<div n="lb"/>no light and all in their place (Nyāsa) was pondering over
<div n="lb"/>when a cross current passed that way and resulted in a
<div n="lb"/>second universe.
<div n="P"/>Vā. 6. 33-45. 109. 4.
