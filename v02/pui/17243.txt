{%Hariścandra%}¦ — son of Triśanku and Satyaratā. Concern-
<div n="lb"/>ing him there was a battle between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>in the disguise of birds for many years. Issueless, and advised
<div n="lb"/>by Nārada, he prayed to Varuṇa for a son, promising to offer
<div n="lb"/>him in sacrifice to the deity. The son was Rohita. Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>reminded him often about the promised sacrifice, and the
<div n="lb"/>king evaded saying that he was not yet fit for it. Knowing
<div n="lb"/>this Rohita left for forests and the king had a disease maho-
<div n="lb"/>dara: when the boy returned to relieve his father, Indra pre-
<div n="lb"/>vented him from going home. Six years passed and Rohita
<div n="lb"/>purchased Sunaśśepa, the second son of Ajiganta and
<div n="lb"/>returned home. Hariścandra proceeded to offer Sunaśśepa
<div n="lb"/>in sacrifice and was relieved of his disease. Sunaśśepa was
<div n="lb"/>sold as a sacrificial animal to Rohita.<sup>1</sup> Attained permanent
