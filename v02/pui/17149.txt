{%Haṃsonārāyaṇa%}¦ — Brahmā; comes out of the Ekārṇava;
the same as what the Āraṇyakas and the Upaniṣads say of
Puruṣoyajña; being a Vedamaya he introduces 16 Ṛtviks
required for a Yajña from the different limbs of a body;
Mārkaṇḍeya came out of his face and saw the world plunged
in waters and wondered at it. Once again he entered the
body of the Lord, and coming out again he saw a child sleep-
ing on a branch of the banyan tree. He got afraid of his
loneliness when the baby Lord asked him not to be afraid of
him and told him that he was his father and Hṛṣikeśa, etc; con-

versation between them; then he entered the bowels of the
Lord;<sup>1</sup> after the stipulated period the Lord thought of the
universe and then came Vaiśvānara; then a thousand-leafed
lotus issued from his navel in the shape of the earth. There
appeared Brahmā, the different hills, countries, Mlecchas,
etc; from this originated Padmavīdhi in Yajñas;<sup>2</sup> there also
came Madhu and Kaiṭabha, two representatives of the
qualities of rajas and tamas who invited the creator for
war. Then they sought and got death from Viṣṇu. Brahmā
created a number of mind-born sons as Progenitors of the
world.<sup>3</sup>
