{%Viṣṇupadam%} (II)¦ — the path where Dharma, Dhruva
and others take their stand above the seven sages; the region
between the seven ṛṣis and Dhruva where live ascetics and
yogis of a high order; the source of rain and the stay of the
three worlds; from this proceeds the Gangā; issuing from the
nail of the great toe of Viṣnu's left foot;<sup>1</sup> the third division
of the celestial region.<sup>2</sup>
