{%Avanti%}¦ (I) {%(c)%} — a kingdom: Here there was a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>miser who lost all his wealth and the love of his kith and
<div n="lb"/>kin, and who became ultimately an ascetic. Though ill-
<div n="lb"/>treated by the public as a thief, he never took notice of it,
<div n="lb"/>and ever meditating on Hari, attained release.<sup>1</sup> The dvijas
<div n="lb"/>of, became Vrātyas after Puramjaya's days.<sup>2</sup> The people
<div n="lb"/>of, were enlisted by Jarāsandha against the Yadus.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Here is Mahākālavana where Rudra vanquished An-
<div n="lb"/>dhaka who sought to abduct Pārvatī;<sup>4</sup> ruled by Śūdras and
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras.<sup>5</sup>
