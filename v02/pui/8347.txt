{%Pṛṣadhra%} (I)¦ — a son of Vaivasvata Manu. Being
<div n="lb"/>appointed by his teacher to be in charge of cattle he attend-
<div n="lb"/>ed to it zealously. During nights he kept awake in {%vīrāsana%}
<div n="lb"/>posture. On a dark rainy night a tiger entered the stall and
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of a cow, when the other cows ran pell-mell. At
<div n="lb"/>this the prince drew the sword, and in the darkness he cut
<div n="lb"/>off the head of a cow and the ear of the tiger. Next morning
<div n="lb"/>he reported the sad news to the preceptor, who cursed him
<div n="lb"/>to become a śūdra. He however continued to live a life of
<div n="lb"/>celibacy, and detachment to things mundane, ever con-
<div n="lb"/>templating on Hari. He reached Brahmā by entering the
<div n="lb"/>forest-fire in the course of his wanderings.
