Matsya Hari during the deluge. After anointing his son
on the throne, M. performed penance on the Malaya Mt.

oblation to his manes, a fish fell into his hand which he
put into his water vessel. Finding its rapid growth he
placed it in a well, tank, Ganges and the sea respectively.
From its abnormal growth he suspected it to be an asura
or Vāsudeva; on questioning it he found it to be the Lord
and was asked to use it (the fish) as the life boat when the
whole world went down in the deluge, saving at the same
time some lives;<sup>5</sup> performed {%tapas%} on the Yamunā for one

woman near Budha's hermitage. Budha got by her a son
by name Purūravas;<sup>10</sup> interpretation of {%Śabdabrahma%} by.<sup>11</sup>
