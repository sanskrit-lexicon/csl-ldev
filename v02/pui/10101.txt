<div n="lb"/>placed it in a well, tank, Ganges and the sea respectively.
<div n="lb"/>From its abnormal growth he suspected it to be an asura
<div n="lb"/>or Vāsudeva; on questioning it he found it to be the Lord

<div n="lb"/>whole world went down in the deluge, saving at the same

<div n="lb"/>gress of the world;<sup>9</sup> in order to get sons he performed the
<div n="lb"/>{%Mitrāvaruṇa%} ritual; owing to the {%hota's%} carelessness a
<div n="lb"/>daughter Ilā came out; she became again a male Sudyumna
<div n="lb"/>by name; by an imprecation of Śiva he again became a
