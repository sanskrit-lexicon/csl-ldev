{%Nṛga%} (II)¦ — a son of Ikṣvāku; liberal in his gift of cows,
silver, etc. Once a cow of a certain Brahmana got mixed
up with his herd, and ignorant of this he made a gift of it
to another Brahmana. The owner charged him, and when
both went to the king, the owner was not prepared to take
anything in its place and he who got the gift would not
part with it for anything; when he went to Yama's abode
he sent him as a lizard for this unrighteous act; in that form
he lived in a well until Kṛṣṇa lifted it up when it became
transformed into a celestial, and blessed by Kṛṣṇa rode in
an aerial car to heaven;<sup>1</sup> release of, by Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā;<sup>2</sup>
his lust after more territory.<sup>3</sup>
