born of Māriṣā and Pracetasas. Was made a chief progeni-
tor on the eve of the Cākṣuṣa epoch;<sup>1</sup> a grandson of Soma;

ears, etc., also {%mlecchas%} and women; also produced 1000
sons with Pāñcajani, named Haryaśvas. Nārada asked them
to go into the world over but they perished in their sojourn.
