{%Rahūgaṇa%}¦ — the king of Sindhu — sauvīra kingdom:
employed Jaḍa-Bharata as his palanquin bearer, and found
fault with him for not bearing it properly: He understood
that he was a Brahmana, felt remorse and enquired who he
was. Heard precepts on Ātmavidyā from Bharata and
became devoted to Hari in a spirit of detachment.
