{%Raji%}¦ — son of Āyu and father of five hundred (hundred
<div n="lb"/>{%M.P.%}) sons known as Rajeyas; a devotee of Nārāyaṇa; was
<div n="lb"/>invested with conquering powers; fearing Prahlāda and
<div n="lb"/>other enemies, Indra gave his kingdom to Raji; once when
<div n="lb"/>the Devāsura (Kolāhala) war broke out between Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>and Indra extending for 300 years both parties invoked his
<div n="lb"/>assistance; he joined the Devas who unlike the Asuras
[Page3-046+ 29]
<div n="lb"/>accepted him as their Lord and he vanquished the Asuras;
<div n="lb"/>Indra became thus his adopted son to whom he gave back
<div n="lb"/>his kingdom and returned to forest for penance.
<div n="P"/>Indra, however, returned the kingdom to Raji; after
<div n="lb"/>Raji's death his sons appropriated the kingdom and refused
<div n="lb"/>to give it to Indra; the latter therefore killed all of them with
<div n="lb"/>the help of Bṛhaspati.<sup>1</sup> It is said where Raji is, there
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī finds her abode; where Lakṣmī is there Dhṛti lives;
<div n="lb"/>where Dhṛti resides, Dhāma lives; where Dhāma lives, there
<div n="lb"/>is Jaya.<sup>2</sup>
