{%Raji%}¦ — son of Āyu and father of five hundred (hundred
{%M.P.%}) sons known as Rajeyas; a devotee of Nārāyaṇa; was
invested with conquering powers; fearing Prahlāda and
other enemies, Indra gave his kingdom to Raji; once when
the Devāsura (Kolāhala) war broke out between Prahlāda
and Indra extending for 300 years both parties invoked his
assistance; he joined the Devas who unlike the Asuras
[Page3-046+ 29]
accepted him as their Lord and he vanquished the Asuras;
Indra became thus his adopted son to whom he gave back
his kingdom and returned to forest for penance.
<div n="P"/>Indra, however, returned the kingdom to Raji; after
Raji's death his sons appropriated the kingdom and refused
to give it to Indra; the latter therefore killed all of them with
the help of Bṛhaspati.<sup>1</sup> It is said where Raji is, there
Lakṣmī finds her abode; where Lakṣmī is there Dhṛti lives;
where Dhṛti resides, Dhāma lives; where Dhāma lives, there
is Jaya.<sup>2</sup>
