{%Andhaka%} (VI)¦ — the asura killed by Śiva: Āḍi and Baka
<div n="lb"/>were his sons; attempted to abduct the Devī in the presence
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva in the Mahākālavana of Avanti. Smitten by Pāśu-
<div n="lb"/>pata, blood came out of his body, out of which were born
<div n="lb"/>numberless Andhakas (s.v.) who overpowered Rudra. The
<div n="lb"/>latter created a number of {%Mātṛs%} who were not enough to
<div n="lb"/>meet them. Vāsudeva was thought of, and he created one
<div n="lb"/>Śuṣkarevati who drank off the blood of Andhakas. On his
<div n="lb"/>submission he was admitted to the group of Gaṇeśas.
<div n="P"/>M. 55. 16; 156. 11-12; 179. 2-40; 252. 5-19.
