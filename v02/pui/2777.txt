{%Kātyāyanī Vratam%}¦ — was observed by the girls of the
<div n="lb"/>{%Vraja%} early in the season of {%Hemanta.%} After bathing in
<div n="lb"/>the Yamunā, they made a figure of the Devī with sand,
<div n="lb"/>and worshipped it as the representation of the Devī for a
<div n="lb"/>month. Their object was to win Kṛṣṇa as their husband.
<div n="lb"/>Prayers were also sent to Bhadrakālī by rising early and
<div n="lb"/>bathing in the Yamunā. To test their sincerity Kṛṣṇa saw
<div n="lb"/>them one day playing in the river naked leaving their clothes
<div n="lb"/>on the banks. He removed these to the top of a Nīpa tree
<div n="lb"/>near by. The girls asked for the return of their clothes, and
<div n="lb"/>threatened to report to the king. Kṛṣṇa asked them to receive
<div n="lb"/>their clothes from him. He said that their vow was fruitless
<div n="lb"/>as they bathed naked, and he returned their clothes on their
<div n="lb"/>saluting him with both their arms. He then blessed them
<div n="lb"/>and asked them to go back to the {%Vraja%} which they did.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. X. 22. 1-27.
