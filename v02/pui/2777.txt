{%Kātyāyanī Vratam%}¦ — was observed by the girls of the
{%Vraja%} early in the season of {%Hemanta.%} After bathing in
the Yamunā, they made a figure of the Devī with sand,
and worshipped it as the representation of the Devī for a
month. Their object was to win Kṛṣṇa as their husband.
Prayers were also sent to Bhadrakālī by rising early and
bathing in the Yamunā. To test their sincerity Kṛṣṇa saw
them one day playing in the river naked leaving their clothes
on the banks. He removed these to the top of a Nīpa tree
near by. The girls asked for the return of their clothes, and
threatened to report to the king. Kṛṣṇa asked them to receive
their clothes from him. He said that their vow was fruitless
as they bathed naked, and he returned their clothes on their
saluting him with both their arms. He then blessed them
and asked them to go back to the {%Vraja%} which they did.
