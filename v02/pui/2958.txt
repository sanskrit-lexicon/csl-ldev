{%Kāliya%} (I)¦ — a chief of the Krodhavaśa group of ser-
<div n="lb"/>pents. Got into a pool of the Yamunā, causing the death
<div n="lb"/>of people who drank of the waters. Kṛṣṇa subjugated it
<div n="lb"/>and ordered it to go to the sea, thus making the waters
<div n="lb"/>drinkable. He assured Kālīya of freedom from Garuḍa's
<div n="lb"/>hostility. Son of Kadru, Kāliya originally lived in Rama-
<div n="lb"/>ṇaka, and refused to give Bali to Garuḍa according to an
<div n="lb"/>agreement with him. In the fight that ensued, Kāliya was
<div n="lb"/>vanquished, and he resorted to the Kālindi pool where
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa could not come. But he was expelled by Kṛṣṇa.<sup>1</sup>
