{%Aṇḍam%}¦ — beyond Āloka. Here are the seven conti-
<div n="lb"/>nents and earth surrounded by a sea of clouds.<sup>1</sup> The golden
<div n="lb"/>egglike {%aṇḍa%} emerges from Īśvara's seed and attains {%yoni%}
<div n="lb"/>{%(prakṛti),%} the latter being the embodiment of Nārāyaṇa, in
<div n="lb"/>a period of a thousand years. It became heaven and earth,
<div n="lb"/>{%ākāśa%} being in the middle.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>The outside is covered with waters ten times the {%aṇḍa%} — 
<div n="lb"/>covered by {%tejas,%} — successively covered by {%vāyu,%} by {%ākāśa,%}
<div n="lb"/>this by {%Bhūtādi;%} that by {%mahat%} and that in turn by {%avyakta%}
<div n="lb"/>each ten times the mass of its predecessor. These are the
<div n="lb"/>seven {%Prakṛtis. Avyakta%} is {%kṣetra%} and Brahmā {%ksetrajña.%}<sup>3</sup>
