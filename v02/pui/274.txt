{%Aṇḍam%}¦ — beyond Āloka. Here are the seven conti-
nents and earth surrounded by a sea of clouds.<sup>1</sup> The golden
egglike {%aṇḍa%} emerges from Īśvara's seed and attains {%yoni%}
{%(prakṛti),%} the latter being the embodiment of Nārāyaṇa, in
a period of a thousand years. It became heaven and earth,
{%ākāśa%} being in the middle.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>The outside is covered with waters ten times the {%aṇḍa%} — 
covered by {%tejas,%} — successively covered by {%vāyu,%} by {%ākāśa,%}
this by {%Bhūtādi;%} that by {%mahat%} and that in turn by {%avyakta%}
each ten times the mass of its predecessor. These are the
seven {%Prakṛtis. Avyakta%} is {%kṣetra%} and Brahmā {%ksetrajña.%}<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Brahmā born of.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Like the moon in {%Kumbha rāśi%} at the commencement
of the {%Śukla pakṣa;%} there are several {%aṇḍams,%} each covered
by seven characteristics of {%Prakṛti.%}<sup>5</sup>
