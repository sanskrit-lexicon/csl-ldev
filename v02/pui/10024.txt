{%Madhu%} (XIV)¦ — a mind-born son of Lord Viṣṇu born
with Kaiṭabha representing {%rajas%} and {%tamas%} qualities;<sup>1</sup> with
Kaiṭabha shook the lotus stand of Brahmā in the navel of
Viṣṇu lying in waters after interview with Rudra; then
Brahmā appealed to Viṣṇu in fear; Bhū, Bhuva and
Suva entered Brahmā; Viṣnu and Jiṣṇu fought with Madhu
Kaitabha when Brahmā acted as arbitrator; the battle con-
tinued for thousands of years; Brahmā entered into con-
templation when Mohini or Viṣṇumāya appeared to the
great grief of the Asuras; both were killed when Brahmā
asked for permission to create four kinds of creatures; with
[Page2-611+ 37]
a view to this he performed austerities when he was filled
with rage and tears out of which came wind, bile and kapha
besides poisonous serpents; Brahmā's grief knew no bounds,
and he swooned and lost his life; when Rudra appeared in
eleven forms out of his face, revived him and helped him in
his creation as his son.<sup>2</sup>
