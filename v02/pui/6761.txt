{%Dhenuka%}¦ — an Asura friend of Kamsa; in the form of
an ass jealously guarded the palmyra forest near Brindā-
vana. At the desire of his cowherd friends to eat the fruits
of that palm grove, Balarāma entered it and brought down
fruits; the Asura came down and kicked him in his chest;
he caught hold of him and whirled him to death; his kith
and kin, other asses came and were dashed against trees;
killed by Kṛṣṇa.<sup>1</sup> A Dānava king,<sup>2</sup> with {%manuṣya dharma.%}<sup>3</sup>
