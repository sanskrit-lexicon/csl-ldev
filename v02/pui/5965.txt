{%Diti%} (I)¦ — a daughter of Dakṣa, and wife of Kaśyapa.<sup>1</sup>
Her sons generally known as Daityas. Mother of
Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu.<sup>2</sup> Mother of Dantavaktra
by the sage's curse.<sup>3</sup> Her sons Prahlāda and Hari were
devotees of Hari.<sup>4</sup> Always set her mind on truth;<sup>5</sup> daughter
Simhikā;<sup>5a</sup> (Ādity-{%Vā. P.%}). Finding her sons slain by
Hari to help Indra, she became enraged, and asked her
husband to bless her with a child to kill Indra. The un-
willing husband offered it on condition of her observing
certain vows for 100 years. So she observed them and
Indra came to assist her. One day he found her sleep-
ing in an unorthodox posture and entering her womb cut
the embryo into seven and then into 49 pieces; but
at her request he gave all of them the status of gods,
known as Maruts.<sup>6</sup> Impelled by passion and desire for
children she approached her husband one evening for
sexual intercourse. Kaśyapa said that it was the hour
when Śivagaṇas moved about and for him, to offer the
{%Śandhya%}-prayer. But she persisted and gained her object.
She however requested to be redeemed of the sin. Kaśyapa
[Page2-088+ 34]
remarked that since she approached him at the wrong time,
her sons would have paiśāca-character and would be killed
by Hari. For her penitence she was blessed with a
righteous child among her grandsons.<sup>7</sup> Held the {%tejas%} in
embryo for a hundred years when darkness enveloped all
directions. The two door-keepers of Vaikuṇṭha cursed by
seers for preventing them from having {%darsan%} of Hari were
born as her two sons, when there were evil omens.<sup>8</sup> Prayed
for another son. This was Vajrānga who on his birth accord-
ing to her orders bound Indra. The latter was released on
the mediation of Brahmā and Kaśyapa.<sup>9</sup> Mother of Daityas;
