{%Vṛtra%} (I)¦ — a son of Tvaṣṭri, created out of a sacrificial
offering with an ugly appearance to avenge Indra, the mur-
derer of Viśvarūpa. Hari advised Indra on the means to
end Vṛtra. In the battle Vṛtra encouraged his soldiers and
uttered words of heroism. Ran towards Indra as Kaiṭabha
against Hari and had one hand cut off. But in the contest
the Vajra of Indra slipped and Vṛka asked him to take up
the weapon and fight. He had his other arm cut off. But
Vṛka swallowed Indra into his stomach from which Indra
escaped and cut off his head. Vṛtra attained Aloka due to
his faith in Hari having been born as Citraketu (s.v.) in his
previous birth.<sup>1</sup> Attained release by {%satsanga.%} His greed for
more territory.<sup>2</sup> Killed by Hālāphala {%avatār.%} An account of
the death in the {%Bhāgavata;%} an Asura of Kṛtayuga.<sup>3</sup> Brought
forth sons from his terrible breathing during his fight with
Indra in thousands. All followers of Mahendra, those who
have realised Brahmā, are happy, dharmic and live in
small bodies.<sup>4</sup>
