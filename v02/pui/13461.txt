{%Vṛtra%} (I)¦ — a son of Tvaṣṭri, created out of a sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>offering with an ugly appearance to avenge Indra, the mur-
<div n="lb"/>derer of Viśvarūpa. Hari advised Indra on the means to
<div n="lb"/>end Vṛtra. In the battle Vṛtra encouraged his soldiers and
<div n="lb"/>uttered words of heroism. Ran towards Indra as Kaiṭabha
<div n="lb"/>against Hari and had one hand cut off. But in the contest
<div n="lb"/>the Vajra of Indra slipped and Vṛka asked him to take up
<div n="lb"/>the weapon and fight. He had his other arm cut off. But
<div n="lb"/>Vṛka swallowed Indra into his stomach from which Indra
<div n="lb"/>escaped and cut off his head. Vṛtra attained Aloka due to
<div n="lb"/>his faith in Hari having been born as Citraketu (s.v.) in his
<div n="lb"/>previous birth.<sup>1</sup> Attained release by {%satsanga.%} His greed for
<div n="lb"/>more territory.<sup>2</sup> Killed by Hālāphala {%avatār.%} An account of
<div n="lb"/>the death in the {%Bhāgavata;%} an Asura of Kṛtayuga.<sup>3</sup> Brought
<div n="lb"/>forth sons from his terrible breathing during his fight with
<div n="lb"/>Indra in thousands. All followers of Mahendra, those who
<div n="lb"/>have realised Brahmā, are happy, dharmic and live in
<div n="lb"/>small bodies.<sup>4</sup>
