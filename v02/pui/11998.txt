{%Lokādhānam%}¦ — Soma takes away the water drunk by
the sun through nāḍis and thus sets in motion the Jyotiṣa
cakram. The clouds drink from Soma and pour in as rain
for six months by the heaviness of the wind; thus the waters
are not wasted; once taken they are returned; from the sun
comes heat, and from the moon {%śītalam.%}
