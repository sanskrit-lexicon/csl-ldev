{%Lokādhānam%}¦ — Soma takes away the water drunk by
<div n="lb"/>the sun through nāḍis and thus sets in motion the Jyotiṣa
<div n="lb"/>cakram. The clouds drink from Soma and pour in as rain
<div n="lb"/>for six months by the heaviness of the wind; thus the waters
<div n="lb"/>are not wasted; once taken they are returned; from the sun
<div n="lb"/>comes heat, and from the moon {%śītalam.%}
<div n="P"/>Vā. 51. 14-16.
