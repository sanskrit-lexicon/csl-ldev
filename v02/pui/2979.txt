{%Kāvya%} (I)¦ — a son of Bhṛgu and Divyā; also {%Śukra,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Uśana,%} the {%Ācārya%} for devas and asuras; Kavisuta and the
<div n="lb"/>name of a planet; wife Gonāma, had four sons, Tvaṣṭa,
<div n="lb"/>Varūtrī, Śaṇḍa, and Marka;<sup>1</sup> the lord of Bhṛgus;<sup>2</sup> cursed
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti.<sup>3</sup> Asuras defeated by Indra appealed to Kāvya
<div n="lb"/>and resolved to go to Rasātala; Kāvya encouraged them and
<div n="lb"/>said that rains, vegetation, etc., would stand completely with
<div n="lb"/>them and only (1/4) with the devas; at that time the devas
<div n="lb"/>appealed to him for help; but Kāvya went to Mahādeva and
<div n="lb"/>learnt the {%mantra%} for their success; in the meantime he
<div n="lb"/>asked them to keep quiet and perform austerities after lay-
<div n="lb"/>ing their weapons down. Mahādeva insisted on {%Kuṇḍa-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%dhūma%} observance for a thousand years with their heads
<div n="lb"/>down; while so engaged the asuras got afraid of the devas
<div n="lb"/>and appealed to his mother and the wife of Bhṛgu; she
<div n="lb"/>offered them shelter but finding them being killed by the
<div n="lb"/>devas she resolved to deprive Indra of his place; then Indra
<div n="lb"/>appealed to Viṣṇu whose body he entered; but she set on
[Page1-371+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>fire the whole world of devas, when out of rage Viṣṇu killed
<div n="lb"/>her; Bhṛgu cursed him to be born seven times among men;
<div n="lb"/>then by power of {%tapas%} he restored his wife to life;
<div n="lb"/>Śukra's religious observance so as to please him; penance
<div n="lb"/>over, Maheśvara granted him three things: non-defeat
<div n="lb"/>by others, lordship over wealth, and eternal life; on
<div n="lb"/>this he praised {%Nīlalohita%} by many names; pleased,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva disappeared; then Śukra was attracted towards Jayantī
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Indra and promised to be with her
<div n="lb"/>for ten years unknown to the asuras by means of
<div n="lb"/>{%māyā;%} when Kāvya returned the asuras were pleased;
<div n="lb"/>but during the ten years Bṛhaspati appeared before
<div n="lb"/>the asuras in the guise of Kāvya and pretended to speak to
<div n="lb"/>them the {%mantra%} he had heard; the asuras accepted him;
<div n="lb"/>ten years were over and a daughter Devayāni was born to
<div n="lb"/>Śukra who appeared before the asuras; finding two Kāvyas
<div n="lb"/>the asuras became mystified and Kāvya said that he was
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati in disguise; the asuras did not believe in the real
<div n="lb"/>Śukra who left them in anger; soon they found out the
<div n="lb"/>mistake and approached Śukra through Prahlāda and he
<div n="lb"/>became pleased; then he approached Brahmā who said that
<div n="lb"/>after ten {%yugas%} and in the Svārociṣa Yuga the asuras would
<div n="lb"/>get back their kingdom; saying this he pointed out to two
<div n="lb"/>disciples Saṇḍa and Marka equal to Bṛhaspati, and at last
<div n="lb"/>the devas were defeated. Seeing the success of the asuras
<div n="lb"/>Viṣnu took different avatars to put them down.<sup>4</sup>
