{%Bali%} (V)¦ — a son of Virocana and the grandson of Prah-
<div n="lb"/>lāda;<sup>1</sup> married Vindyāvalī and Aśanā; had one hundred sons
<div n="lb"/>of whom Bāṇa was the eldest; all of them were kings; king
<div n="lb"/>of the Asuras;<sup>1</sup> other chief sons were Kumbhanābha, Garda-
<div n="lb"/>bhākṣa, and Kuśi; two daughters were Śakunī and Pūtanā;<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>carried away the crown of Hari inlaid with gems; was pur-
<div n="lb"/>sued by the warder of the city, Garuḍa who recovered it
<div n="lb"/>after a fight.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Indra on the advice of Hari-Ajita sought an alliance
<div n="lb"/>with him and it was concluded; they also agreed to churn
<div n="lb"/>the ocean in a co-operative spirit; got exhausted in the
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtamathana; appropriated Uccaiśravas which came out
<div n="lb"/>of the Amṛtamathana; in the Devāsura war following the
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtamathana, Bali became the commander and was riding
<div n="lb"/>in an aerial car with the Asuras; finding it difficult to fight
<div n="lb"/>Indra and the Gods openly he took to illusory methods by
<div n="lb"/>resorting to creating fire, storms, rains, etc.; encouraged by
<div n="lb"/>Hari's presence, Indra again called him to battle and Bali
<div n="lb"/>fell down unconscious after a strenuous fight; taken to Asta-
<div n="lb"/>giri where by Sañjīvini Vidyā, Śukra brought him back to
<div n="lb"/>life; the Bhṛgu Brahmanas aided him in the completion of
<div n="lb"/>his Viśvajit sacrifice and anointed him with mahābhiṣeka;
<div n="lb"/>receiving gifts from all quarters Bali marched to the city of
<div n="lb"/>Indra on a chariot given by Bhṛgu and besieged it; on Indra
<div n="lb"/>and the Gods vacating the city on the advice of Bṛhaspati,
<div n="lb"/>Bali took possession of it and performed 100 Aśvamedhas
<div n="lb"/>with the aid of the Bhṛgu Brahmanas;<sup>3</sup> once Bali was
<div n="lb"/>engaged in performing the Aśvamedha in the Bhṛgukaccha
<div n="lb"/>on the northern bank of the Narmadā. Tither came the
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana Hari in the form of a dwarf and Brahmacārin,
<div n="lb"/>whom Bali welcomed and requested to accept some gift;
<div n="lb"/>pleased with his speech Vāmana asked for 3 feet of ground,
<div n="lb"/>and though Bali offered to give more he declined it; Śukra
<div n="lb"/>knew that he was Hari and dissuaded Bali from agreeing to
<div n="lb"/>his request; Bali's resolve to keep his word resulting in his
<div n="lb"/>being cursed by Śukra to lose all {%Śrī;%} gift to Vāmana helped
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Vindhyāvalī; Vāmana's {%viśvarūpa%} and his
[Page2-470+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>measuring the Earth and Heaven by two feet; seeing the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras beaten by Hari's attendants, Bali asked them not to
<div n="lb"/>fight; knowing Hari's mind Garuḍa bound Bali with
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa's cords; on the sutya day of the sacrifice Bali thought
<div n="lb"/>of Prahlāda; asked by Vāmana to show room for placing his
<div n="lb"/>third foot, Bali was unable to find any space except his head
<div n="lb"/>and was doomed to hell; Bali's prayer to Hari; Prahlāda's
<div n="lb"/>arrival and prayer to the Lord; appeal of Vindyāvalī and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā; humbled by Vāmana; blessed by Hari to be the
<div n="lb"/>Indra of the Sāvarṇi epoch and in the meantime king of
<div n="lb"/>Sutala; attained permanent fame.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>After taking leave of Hari and praising him duly, Bali
<div n="lb"/>and Prahlāda entered the cave Sutala; the lordship of the
<div n="lb"/>worlds had no charm for him; moved by his devotion, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>once acted as his door-keeper; got the grace of Hari and
<div n="lb"/>attained permanent fame and final release by {%satsaṅga;%}<sup>5</sup> a
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Hari; was obliged to Viṣṇu and knew his {%yoga-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%māyā;%} one of the twelve, who knew the {%dharma%} ordained
<div n="lb"/>by Hari;<sup>6</sup> Parīkṣit compared to, for his courage.<sup>7</sup> His queen
<div n="lb"/>was Aśanā.<sup>8</sup> A resident of Pātala;<sup>9</sup> anointed his five sons in
<div n="lb"/>the seventh yuga of the Treta, and wandered unseen by
<div n="lb"/>others;<sup>10</sup> a servant of Hiraṇyakaśipu.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bali asked Prahlāda the reason for the loss of refulgence
<div n="lb"/>on the part of the Asuras; he discovered the Lord in the
<div n="lb"/>womb of Aditi and spoke of his incarnation and the conse-
<div n="lb"/>quent ruin of the Asuras; Bali spoke of his prowess and
<div n="lb"/>insulted the Lord when Prahlāda cursed him to lose all his
<div n="lb"/>kingship. He consulted Śukra as to what should be done
<div n="lb"/>if the Lord should visit his {%yajña;%} Śukra said he must be
<div n="lb"/>given some choice gift. The Lord appeared and wanted
<div n="lb"/>space for three steps. Bali consented. The first and second
<div n="lb"/>was placed in heaven and the earth and the third on his
<div n="lb"/>head. The Lord asked Bali to reside in the Pātāla region
<div n="lb"/>and made Indra the king of the three worlds. Bali to
<div n="lb"/>occupy the place of Indra in the Sāvarṇi epoch; until then
<div n="lb"/>he was to receive the gifts not given properly, ceremonies
[Page2-471+ 20]
<div n="lb"/>done with non-{%śrotriyas,%} insincere {%yajñas,%} giftless {%yajñas,%}
<div n="lb"/>irregular {%karmas%} and improper study of the Vedas;<sup>12</sup>
