{%Sannati%} (II)¦ — a daughter of Devala and queen of Brah-
madatta, the Pāñcāla king; she was in one of her previous
births the cow of Garga killed by the sons of Kauśika for
food during famine. She had great attainments and was
a Brahmavādinī;<sup>1</sup> once she went with the king to the pleasure
garden where the latter broke into laughter at the love
quarrel between two ants; the queen took it as an insult to
her and threatened to leave him; the king after a penance
came to recognise his previous birth by the grace of Viṣṇu
and leaving the kingdom to his son retired from the world;
the queen who caused all this fell, but ultimately got salva-
tion due to her repentance.<sup>2</sup>
