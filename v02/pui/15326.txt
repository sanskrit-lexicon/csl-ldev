{%Sannati%} (II)¦ — a daughter of Devala and queen of Brah-
<div n="lb"/>madatta, the Pāñcāla king; she was in one of her previous
<div n="lb"/>births the cow of Garga killed by the sons of Kauśika for
<div n="lb"/>food during famine. She had great attainments and was
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmavādinī;<sup>1</sup> once she went with the king to the pleasure
<div n="lb"/>garden where the latter broke into laughter at the love
<div n="lb"/>quarrel between two ants; the queen took it as an insult to
<div n="lb"/>her and threatened to leave him; the king after a penance
<div n="lb"/>came to recognise his previous birth by the grace of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and leaving the kingdom to his son retired from the world;
<div n="lb"/>the queen who caused all this fell, but ultimately got salva-
<div n="lb"/>tion due to her repentance.<sup>2</sup>
