{%Devayānī%} (I)¦ — the daughter of Śukra and Ūrjasvatī
(Yajanī, Jayantī); accompanied Śarmiṣṭhā, the Asura king's
daughter to water-sports; when Śarmiṣṭhā clothed herself
[Page2-122+ 37]
with Devayānī's dress by mistake, Devayānī treated her as
a slave, she being the daughter of a Brahmana Purohita. The
Princess became enraged, stripped her and cast her into a
well and went away; when she was crying helpless there
came Yayāti who was on a hunting expedition. He gave her
his upper cloth to wear and lifted her up. Devayānī request-
ed him to be her husband, saying that she had been cursed
by Kaca, Bṛhaspati's son, to marry only a Kṣatriya. Yayāti
agreed and departed. Devayāni reported Śarmiṣṭhā's con-
duct to her father Śukra who left the palace in disgust. The
king implored him on his knees, when Śukra agreed to stay
on if Śarmiṣṭhā would be appointed as servant of his
daughter. This was agreed upon, and Śarmiṣṭhā became her
servant. When Devayānī was married to Yayāti, Śukra
presented Śarmiṣṭhā as his daughter's maid. She had two
sons Yadu and Turvasu. Learning of her husband's connec-
tion with Śarmiṣṭhā during her own pregnancy, Devayānī
left for her father's house. Yayāti followed her and was
cursed by Śukra to fall a prey to old age. Yayāti appealed
to him to mitigate the curse as his desire for enjoyment with
his daughter was still keen. Then Śukra said that if
anyone would give him his youth and take up old age then he
could regain his youth. His son Pūru agreed and once more
the king enjoyed the company of Devayānī;<sup>2</sup> heard the story
of an ewe loved by a ram from Yayāti, and thought it was
an allusion to her; became detached and cast off her body
with her mind on Hari.<sup>3</sup>
