{%Śiśupāla%}¦ — a son of Śrutaśravas and Damaghoṣa; in pre-
<div n="lb"/>vious births, Hiraṇyakaśipu killed by Narasimha and Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>(Daśagrīva) killed by Rāma; a hater of Hari but was shown
<div n="lb"/>grace by Kṛṣṇa;<sup>1</sup> attacked the northern gate of Mathurā and
<div n="lb"/>Gomanta when they were besieged by Jarāsandha;<sup>2</sup> engaged
<div n="lb"/>by Bhīṣmaka for his daughter Rukmiṇī under the influence
<div n="lb"/>of Rukmin, his eldest son; defeated by Kṛṣṇa who carried
<div n="lb"/>off Rukmiṇī; consoled by his friends that Time was not in
<div n="lb"/>his favour he returned to his city.<sup>3</sup> Protested against the
<div n="lb"/>place of honour being given to Kṛṣṇa when Brahmaṛṣis and
<div n="lb"/>Rājaṛṣis were available. He vilified him as a cowherd given
<div n="lb"/>to drinking and not an observer of Varṇadharma. While the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas drew their swords, Kṛṣṇa cut off his head.<sup>4</sup> His
[Page3-433+ 35]
<div n="lb"/>friend was Śālva who summoned a conference at Kuṇḍina
<div n="lb"/>to which Śiśupāla went.<sup>5</sup> As he died remembering the Lord,
<div n="lb"/>he attained mokṣa;<sup>6</sup> (see Caidya). Maitreya asked Parāśara
<div n="lb"/>how it was that though he was killed by the Lords Nara-
<div n="lb"/>simha and Rāma, Hiraṇyakaśipu did not attain salvation but
<div n="lb"/>was reborn as Śisupāla, and how he attained it when killed
<div n="lb"/>by Kṛṣṇa; Parāśara replied that neither Hiraṇyakaśipu nor
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa knew that Narasimha or Rāma were the {%avatārs%} of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu; Śiśupāla knew in his heart of hearts that Kṛṣṇa was
<div n="lb"/>God Viṣṇu and welcomed death at his hands. Hence his
<div n="lb"/>salvation.<sup>7</sup>
