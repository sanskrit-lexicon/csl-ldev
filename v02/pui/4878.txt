{%Caidya%} (I)¦ — a son of Yudhiṣṭhira's aunt and Dama-
ghoṣa and brother of Dantavaktra. Both were once attend-

went to Viṣṇuloka and were prevented by them, as door-
keepers, from entering Vaikuṇṭha. Hence they were cursed
to be born as Asuras. They were born as Hiraṇyakaśipu and
Hiraṇyākṣa, then as Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa, and now as
Caidya and Dantavaktra.<sup>1</sup> Hated Kṛṣṇa, beaten by him in
