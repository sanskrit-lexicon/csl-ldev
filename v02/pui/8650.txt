{%Prayāgā%} (II)¦ — (Māhātmyam): Markaṇḍeya to
Yudhiṣṭhira on; here is Prajāpatikṣetra; people who
bathe here go to heaven and who die here are liberated
from {%samsāra;%} guarded by Indra; there are five deep
channels in Prayāgā with the Ganges flowing in their midst.
Sins are washed off by entering its boundary. The
goddess Yamunā, the daughter of the Sun God is ever
present: It is a place haunted by the Gods, Asuras, Ṛṣis
and Siddhas;<sup>1</sup> one who remembers Prayāgā from his own
native home or from a foreign place on the eve of his death
goes to the world of Brahmā. Leaving the heaven, he is
reborn as a King of Jambūdvīpa; gifts of cows, jewels and
gold here attain great merit: The giver is born in Uttara
Kuru regions and enjoys long life.<sup>2</sup> One should not drive
to the place in a conveyance drawn by bullocks lest the
virtue of bathing should be lost. Giving daughters in mar-
riage, and death near the Akṣayavaṭa helps one in going to
the world of Śiva. One should go and do charities with
utmost faith. Here are 60 crores and 10000 holy spots; well-
known for a Śiva shrine: Pratiṣṭhāna lies to the east of
the Ganges, and to its north lies the Hamsaprapatana {%Tīrtha.%}
There are again Ūrvaśīramaṇa, Sandhya Vaṭa, Koṭī {%Tīrtha,%}
and others, all holy;<sup>3</sup> by merely listening to the greatness of
Prayāgā a man gets liberated. To the south of Prayāgā
there is a Ṛṇamocana {%Tīrtha%} where by residing for a night
and by bathing, one never runs into debts. A pilgrimage to
P. gives the benefit of an Aśvamedha sacrifice: relieves his
{%manes%} for ten generations: its circumference is five yojanas
[Page2-428+ 35]
and every step is sacred: the greatness of the Yamunā
described;<sup>4</sup> a man dying at P. gets the benefits of a
Yogin: the king of all {%tīrthas:%} P. is again the place where
both Kambala and Aśvatara reside. It is the altar of Prajā-
pati. It is more sacred, being situated on the banks of the
Ganges. It is the giver of heaven, the personification of
bliss and truth: Reading the Mahātmya takes one to
heaven;<sup>5</sup> Here Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva are all present.
Brahmā stands on the Northern part of the {%Tīrtha%} to protect
it: Viṣṇu is represented as Veṇī Mādhava, while Śiva is
present in the shape of a banyan tree. In addition to them,
the gods, oceans and mountains also live there. It is known
as Prajāpati Indrakṣetra. One who remembers this every
day attains heaven. After hearing this, Yudhiṣṭhira is said
to have bathed in Prayāgā.<sup>6</sup>
