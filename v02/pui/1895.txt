{%Umā%} (I)¦ — worshipped for a happy family.<sup>1</sup> Her splen-
dour.<sup>2</sup> Also known as Ambikā; also Rudrāṇī.<sup>3</sup> In the forest
of Sukumāra.<sup>4</sup> Consort of Śiva, also Gaurī; originally
Dākṣāyanī, daughter of Menā and Himavān. Original name
Aparṇā. Her garden: a śakti:<sup>5</sup> The world of: {%Adhidevatā%}
for the planet Soma.<sup>6</sup> Festivities at her birth.<sup>7</sup> Going with
her father to Śiva's house, they met Rati weeping on the
way. She said that Śiva had burnt down her husband. On
this Umā's father did not like the idea of giving his daughter
to such an ill-tempered person. Umā requested permis-
sion to do penance and was allowed. Indra at this time
thought of the seven sages to bring about Śiva's marriage
with Umā. The sages were satisfied of her steadfast love
to Śiva and had his consent for the marriage; celestial
women dressed Umā, as also the god Śiva; amidst divine
music, the couple went to the city of Mahāgirinagara and
Brahmā officiated as priest: After the marriage they left for
Mandaragiri.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Once Umā made a doll with elephant face and dropped it
in the Ganges. It became a huge figure and was claimed
as son by Umā and the Ganges respectively.<sup>9</sup> Then Umā
[Page1-239+ 41]
grew a tender Aśoka plant when Bṛhaspati and others told
her that she would have a real son and that trees and dolls
were no satisfaction;<sup>10</sup> once she heard a yell of noise and
was told of the play engaged in by Gaṇas, and then her
eyes attracted Vīraka. She expressed to Śiva for a son like
Vīraka. Śiva asked her to have him as her child. He was
sent for and nursed by Umā.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Touched by Goddess of Night, she became black in
colour. Śiva found fault with her and after reproaching
him with his past deeds, she left him for penance. Vīraka
appealed to her when she said she would return as Gaurī.
She asked Vīraka to see that no lady entered her harem.
Meanwhile Āḍi, son of Andhakāsura entered Śiva's abode
in the guise of Umā but was slain by Śiva. Hearing from
Vāyu that a lady entered her home, she cursed Vīraka to
be born on the earth; out of her rage came out a lion which
Brahmā gave to the Goddess of Night, who was asked to
leave Umā for the Vindhya hills. Now Umā became Gaurī
and entered Śiva's abode when Vīraka stopped her, as he
did not at first recognise her. Convinced of his mother's
identity, he requested her to recall her curse and was
assured of a place in Devagaṇa.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>While Umā was sporting with Śiva, Agni entered the
harem in the form of a parrot. Noticing this Umā left the
bed and Śiva made Agni drink his {%vīrya.%} Out of the scat-
tered {%vīrya,%} there sprang up a beautiful pond where the six
Pleiades bathed and took water in a lotus leaf. Blessed by
them the Devī got the {%garbha%} and out of her left side came
out Subrahmaṇya.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>Going through the {%Udyānam%} again Śiva spoke to her
of the greatness of Benares.<sup>14</sup> Satī in previous birth.<sup>15</sup>
