{%Dhruva%} (I)¦ — a son of Uttānapāda and Sunīti {%(Bhā. P.%}
<div n="lb"/>{%& Vi. P.)%} ({%M., Br. & Vā. P.%} speak of Sūnṛtā as his mother).
<div n="lb"/>A grandson of Svāyambhuva Manu; hated by his father's
<div n="lb"/>more beloved wife, Suruci, took leave of his mother to go
<div n="lb"/>to the forest; met Nārada and was blessed, advised and
<div n="lb"/>initiated by the sage; as a child of five went to Madhuvana
<div n="lb"/>on the bank of the Yamunā; continued to meditate on the
<div n="lb"/>Lord's glory for a period of 10,000 years, sometime eating
<div n="lb"/>roots and fruits, and sometime fasting; sought refuge in
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, standing on one foot to the great consternation of
<div n="lb"/>gods.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hari appeared before him, and touching his baby
<div n="lb"/>cheeks, conferred on him divine speech; his praise of the
<div n="lb"/>Lord; assuring him a place in the mansion of the luminaries,
<div n="lb"/>Hari asked him to go home and rule righteously which he
<div n="lb"/>did for 36,000 years. Dhruva's return was welcomed by
<div n="lb"/>the king and his queens; bowed to his parents and embraced
<div n="lb"/>Uttāna; was welcomed by the citizens; getting old, the king
<div n="lb"/>anointed Dhruva and retired to forest.<sup>2</sup> Had two queens:
<div n="lb"/>one was Bhramī who gave birth to Kalpa and Vatsara; the
<div n="lb"/>other Ilā whose son was Utkala. (According to {%Br. P.%} one
<div n="lb"/>wife was Bhūmī who gave birth to Sṛṣṭi and Bhavya; accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to {%M. P.%} Dhanyā, the daughter of Manas was one of his
<div n="lb"/>queens and her son was Śiṣṭa.).
<div n="P"/>Heard the death of his brother Uttama at the hands of
<div n="lb"/>a Yakṣa and led an expedition to the city of the Yakṣas: In
<div n="lb"/>the war innocents also were killed, whereupon his grand-
<div n="lb"/>sire, Manu came to the spot and advised to desist from it,
<div n="lb"/>especially as it would irritate Kubera. On this, he met
<div n="lb"/>Kubera who praised his valour and his sense of duty and
<div n="lb"/>offered some boons. Dhruva asked that he must ever
<div n="lb"/>remember the feet of the Lord.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ruled the kingdom for 36,000 years, performed {%yajña,%}
<div n="lb"/>appointed his son on the throne and retired to Viśāla
<div n="lb"/>(Badarikāśrama). Meditating on the Lord for 3,000 years,
<div n="lb"/>was taken to his eternal abode in the world of luminaries
[Page2-187+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>in a divine car. By tapas he set his foot on Yama when he
<div n="lb"/>saw his mother going before him to Heaven; was obliged to
<div n="lb"/>Harī, the power of whose yoga he knew.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nārada narrated to Prācetas the story of Dhruva and
<div n="lb"/>sang his praise.
<div n="P"/>The Pole-star: earned a place in Viṣṇupada: at the end
<div n="lb"/>of the tail of Siśumāra:<sup>5</sup> with Indra, Agni and other deities,
<div n="lb"/>and in front of the Saptaṛṣis:<sup>6</sup> Helps the planets in their
<div n="lb"/>movements: responsible for the days, nights and seasons of
<div n="lb"/>the year: aids in the formation of clouds and fall of rains:<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the year of Dhruva: In praise of.<sup>8</sup>
