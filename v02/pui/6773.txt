{%Dhruva%} (I)¦ — a son of Uttānapāda and Sunīti {%(Bhā. P.%}
{%& Vi. P.)%} ({%M., Br. & Vā. P.%} speak of Sūnṛtā as his mother).
A grandson of Svāyambhuva Manu; hated by his father's
more beloved wife, Suruci, took leave of his mother to go
to the forest; met Nārada and was blessed, advised and
initiated by the sage; as a child of five went to Madhuvana
on the bank of the Yamunā; continued to meditate on the
Lord's glory for a period of 10,000 years, sometime eating
roots and fruits, and sometime fasting; sought refuge in
Viṣṇu, standing on one foot to the great consternation of
gods.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hari appeared before him, and touching his baby
cheeks, conferred on him divine speech; his praise of the
Lord; assuring him a place in the mansion of the luminaries,
Hari asked him to go home and rule righteously which he
did for 36,000 years. Dhruva's return was welcomed by
the king and his queens; bowed to his parents and embraced
Uttāna; was welcomed by the citizens; getting old, the king
anointed Dhruva and retired to forest.<sup>2</sup> Had two queens:
one was Bhramī who gave birth to Kalpa and Vatsara; the
other Ilā whose son was Utkala. (According to {%Br. P.%} one
wife was Bhūmī who gave birth to Sṛṣṭi and Bhavya; accord-
ing to {%M. P.%} Dhanyā, the daughter of Manas was one of his
queens and her son was Śiṣṭa.).
<div n="P"/>Heard the death of his brother Uttama at the hands of
a Yakṣa and led an expedition to the city of the Yakṣas: In
the war innocents also were killed, whereupon his grand-
sire, Manu came to the spot and advised to desist from it,
especially as it would irritate Kubera. On this, he met
Kubera who praised his valour and his sense of duty and
offered some boons. Dhruva asked that he must ever
remember the feet of the Lord.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ruled the kingdom for 36,000 years, performed {%yajña,%}
appointed his son on the throne and retired to Viśāla
(Badarikāśrama). Meditating on the Lord for 3,000 years,
was taken to his eternal abode in the world of luminaries
[Page2-187+ 40]
in a divine car. By tapas he set his foot on Yama when he
saw his mother going before him to Heaven; was obliged to
Harī, the power of whose yoga he knew.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nārada narrated to Prācetas the story of Dhruva and
sang his praise.
<div n="P"/>The Pole-star: earned a place in Viṣṇupada: at the end
of the tail of Siśumāra:<sup>5</sup> with Indra, Agni and other deities,
and in front of the Saptaṛṣis:<sup>6</sup> Helps the planets in their
movements: responsible for the days, nights and seasons of
the year: aids in the formation of clouds and fall of rains:<sup>7</sup>
the year of Dhruva: In praise of.<sup>8</sup>
