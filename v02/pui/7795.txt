{%Pārijāta%} (I)¦ — a heavenly plant; Satyabhāmā saw it in
Indra's Nandana and asked Kṛṣṇa to take it home; Kṛṣṇa
refused as it was once taken from the milk-ocean and by the
consent of the gods given to Indra and to remove it was to
face a war with him; still Satyabhāmā persisted and Kṛṣṇa
yielding to her placed it on the Garuḍa; took it to the earth
against Indra's will and placed it in Satybhāmā's garden; the
watchmen objected and reported to Indra; war about the
Pārijāta between the Gods and Kṛṣṇa; a compromise to be
returned after Kṛṣṇa's decease;<sup>1</sup> rejoiced by Dvārakā
citizens.<sup>2</sup> The tree in Śivaloka, that came out of the churn-
ing of the ocean.<sup>3</sup>
