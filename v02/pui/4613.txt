{%Candragupta%} (II)¦ — the unrighteous minister of Hai-
<div n="lb"/>haya who advised the king to get by peace or force the cow
<div n="lb"/>of Jamadagni so that he could ever have plenty. The king
<div n="lb"/>agreed and sent him to fetch the cow. Jamadagni argued
<div n="lb"/>that it was intended for religious purposes. The minister,
<div n="lb"/>without listening to those words had the animal bound.
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni tied himself to the cow, and being beaten fell
<div n="lb"/>down dead. The cow kicked off her fetters and flew into
[Page1-584+ 29]
<div n="lb"/>heaven. The minister reported the matter to the king who
<div n="lb"/>returned to his city greatly dejected.
<div n="P"/>Br. III. 28. 31-7; 29. 8 ff.
