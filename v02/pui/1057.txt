{%Asamañjas%}¦ — a Kākutstha; the son of Sagara by
<div n="lb"/>Keśinī. Father of Amśumān: In previous birth as a Vaiśya
<div n="lb"/>he discovered a treasure. A spirit guarding it asked him
<div n="lb"/>to quench his hunger with cow's flesh and carry away the
<div n="lb"/>treasure. But he took it without providing food. So when
<div n="lb"/>born to Keśinī, the spirit entered him as wind and hence
<div n="lb"/>demented; used to throw his playmates into the Sarayū; was
<div n="lb"/>banished by his father. He left the capital after bringing
<div n="lb"/>them back to life by his wonderful yogic powers.
