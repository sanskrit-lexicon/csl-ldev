{%Asamañjas%}¦ — a Kākutstha; the son of Sagara by
Keśinī. Father of Amśumān: In previous birth as a Vaiśya
he discovered a treasure. A spirit guarding it asked him
to quench his hunger with cow's flesh and carry away the
treasure. But he took it without providing food. So when
born to Keśinī, the spirit entered him as wind and hence
demented; used to throw his playmates into the Sarayū; was
banished by his father. He left the capital after bringing
them back to life by his wonderful yogic powers.
