{%Śālva%}¦ — a Dānava king and friend of Śiśupāla and
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha; an enemy of Kṛṣṇa; when Hamsa, his
<div n="lb"/>brother, was killed by Kṛṣṇa he wanted to avenge his death
<div n="lb"/>and after meeting his friends at Kuṇḍina, took a vow to wipe
<div n="lb"/>out the Yādavas; he performed tapas to propitiate Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>got an aerial car to go to any place, given to him by
<div n="lb"/>Maya; hearing of Śiśupāla's death, he grew angry and at-
<div n="lb"/>tacked Dvārakā. Pradyumna, Sātyaki and others offered
<div n="lb"/>resistance. His commander-in-chief was defeated. But his
<div n="lb"/>minister Dyumat hit Pradyumna in the chest when his cha-
<div n="lb"/>rioteer removed him from the field. After recovering,
<div n="lb"/>he attacked Dyumat and vanquished him. For twenty-
<div n="lb"/>seven days the battle went on, when Kṛṣṇa arrived.
<div n="lb"/>He directed his attack towards Śālva, who attacked
<div n="lb"/>him when his bow slipped from his hand. After
<div n="lb"/>a hot discussion and some more fight, Śālva dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared and sent to Kṛṣṇa a māyā messenger saying that
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva had been taken prisoner by Śālva. Then Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>saw a scene where a māyā Vasudeva was killed. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>knew that all this was due to illusory powers and kept cool.
<div n="lb"/>He broke his car and cut off his head.<sup>1</sup> Attained mokṣa by
<div n="lb"/>hatred of Kṛṣṇa.<sup>2</sup>
