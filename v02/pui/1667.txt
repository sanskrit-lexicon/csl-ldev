{%Vā. P.%}) of Paurava dynasty. Father of Kṣema; slew father
of Pṛthuka, the Pāñcāla Nīla:
<div n="P"/>Conqueror of Nīpas: was engaged in severe austerities
for 18,000 years. Was served by Janamejaya, son of Bhallāṭa.
They were both attacked by Nīpas who were unmoved by
Ugrāyudha's appeals for peace and protection; then Ugrā-
yudha asked Lord of Death to destroy them. Soon he took
pity and asked Yama to save them; and this led to a scuffle
between Yama and the king who got salvation.
<div n="P"/>M. 49. 59-78; Vā. 99. 182, 191; Vi. IV. 19. 53-55.
