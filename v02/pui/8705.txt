{%Prahlāda%} (I)¦ — (also Prahrāda): son of Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>and Kayādhu, a dānavī;<sup>1</sup> a devotee and attendant of Hari; of
<div n="lb"/>Narasimha and Kṛṣṇa in Harivarṣa,<sup>2</sup> Lord of the Daityas and
<div n="lb"/>Dānavas;<sup>2a</sup> most righteous of Hiraṇyakaśipu's sons, a Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhāgavata and a Mahātma,<sup>3</sup> Dattātreya was a tutor: Saṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Marka, sons of Śukra, were his tutors to teach him
<div n="lb"/>kingly policy and Trivarga;<sup>4</sup> served as calf for the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>to milk liquor from the earth;<sup>5</sup> one of the twelve, who knew
<div n="lb"/>the {%dharma%} ordained by Hari;<sup>6</sup> at the repeated tests of his
<div n="lb"/>father he spoke of the nine ways of devotion to Hari; was
<div n="lb"/>ordered to be killed, by being trodden by elephants, or to be
<div n="lb"/>done to death by poison, fire or water; all these were of no
<div n="lb"/>avail; he was then bound by noose; Prahlāda once lectured
<div n="lb"/>to his playmates and classmates on the importance of devo-
[Page2-435+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>tion to Hari even from childhood as it is rare to be born a
<div n="lb"/>man, and even as a man one half of the life is wasted in
<div n="lb"/>sleep and one quarter in old age; once one got into the
<div n="lb"/>groove of {%samsāra%} it was not possible to get out of it; so he
<div n="lb"/>asked them to aim at knowledge following the pure {%Bhāga-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vata Dharma;%} asked by the Daitya boys how and when he
<div n="lb"/>got that knowledge, he narrated how when his father went
<div n="lb"/>out to Mandara for penance, his mother was taken captive by
<div n="lb"/>Indra who set her at liberty on the advice of Nārada, who
<div n="lb"/>kept her in custody until his father's return. As she was
<div n="lb"/>pregnant she prayed to the sage for the welfare of the child
<div n="lb"/>in the womb; thus he earned the grace of Nārada. He there-
<div n="lb"/>fore looked upon {%ātman%} as the only thing eternal and all
<div n="lb"/>other things unreal; to attain Hari there were several ways,
<div n="lb"/>such as listening to his stories, or singing his praise; {%samsāra%}
<div n="lb"/>and other objects of desire were to be discarded and any-
<div n="lb"/>body of any caste or creed could attain salvation by worship-
<div n="lb"/>ping Hari; when this was reported to his father by the tutor,
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda was sent for and threatened with death if he
<div n="lb"/>persisted in his devotion to Hari. Prahlāda was defiant in
<div n="lb"/>the sabhā of Hiraṇyakaśipu; found in Narasimha the Lord
<div n="lb"/>Vāsudeva and spoke to those in the sabhā, but in vain; tak-
<div n="lb"/>ing up his sword Hiraṇyakaśipu asked him to show Hari at
<div n="lb"/>the post near by which he knocked with his fist; out came
<div n="lb"/>Narasimha and destroyed Hiraṇyakaśipu in the midst of
<div n="lb"/>portents; universal rejoicing and praise of Hari; the Gods
<div n="lb"/>found Narasimha still raging in anger and requested
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda to praise Him; his praise; pleased, the Lord prompt-
<div n="lb"/>ed him to ask for boons; Prahlāda said that desires were
<div n="lb"/>the seeds of {%samsāra%} and therefore he did not want them;
<div n="lb"/>he only wanted to be ever devoted to him; Narasimha asked
<div n="lb"/>him to be king and at the same time be devoted to him; and
<div n="lb"/>when the time came for him he could cast off his body and
<div n="lb"/>get himself merged into Hari; then Prahlāda requested for
<div n="lb"/>the pardon and purification of his father which were grant-
<div n="lb"/>ed; after the funeral ceremonies of his father, Prahlāda
[Page2-436+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>became king; then he worshipped Brahmā, Śiva and other
<div n="lb"/>Gods who all blessed him; obliged to Viṣṇu;<sup>7</sup> father of
<div n="lb"/>Āyuṣmān, Śibi, Bāṣkala and Virocana;<sup>8</sup> Indra afraid of;<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a boon to Prahlāda not to kill any of his race;<sup>10</sup> praise of by
<div n="lb"/>Bali who belonged to his family; arrived when Bali bound
<div n="lb"/>by ropes was addressing Hari; and was bowed to by him;
<div n="lb"/>addressed Hari; Kṛṣṇa who had promised Prahlāda not to
<div n="lb"/>slay princes of his line allowed Bāṇa to escape; blessings to
<div n="lb"/>Bali;<sup>11</sup> his request to Hari before leaving for Sutala; left
<div n="lb"/>Sutala or the great cave; attained final release by {%satsanga.%}<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>Parīkṣit compared to for his pure devotion;<sup>13</sup> Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>compared to the moon shining in the sky.<sup>14</sup> One of the three
<div n="lb"/>Indras of the Dānavas and Asuras;<sup>15</sup> fought for 300 years
<div n="lb"/>with Indra, but was finally defeated by Raji son of Āyu;
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Indra in the churning of the ocean for nectar
<div n="lb"/>(an {%avatār%} of Viṣṇu);<sup>16</sup> duration of rule, as long as that
<div n="lb"/>of Bali;<sup>17</sup> deceived by Bṛhaspati begged excuse of Śukra;<sup>18</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā was purohita to God incarnate,<sup>19</sup> made the 16 gifts,<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>asked by Bali why the Asuras lost their effulgence Prah-
<div n="lb"/>lāda found out by Yoga the Lord in the womb of Aditi and
<div n="lb"/>predicted evil to the Asuras; Bali pooh-poohed and spoke
<div n="lb"/>of his prowess. Prahlāda prediceted that he would be ruined
<div n="lb"/>with his kingdom for having insulted the Lord.<sup>21</sup> Indra of
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras<sup>22</sup> of the Vitalam;<sup>23</sup> Maitreya's question on the
<div n="lb"/>career of;<sup>24</sup> tormented by his father for thinking of God
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu in different ways;<sup>25</sup> was administered poison and other
<div n="lb"/>means to kill him; Śambara's hand in;<sup>26</sup> his father killed
<div n="lb"/>by Narasimha<sup>27</sup> becomes the lord (Indra) of the Daityas,
<div n="lb"/>and Dānavas.<sup>28</sup>
