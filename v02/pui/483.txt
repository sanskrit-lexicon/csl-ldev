{%Anaupamyā%}¦ — the wife of Bāṇāsura. Illtreated by
mother-in-law and sister-in-law she was initiated into a
{%mantra%} by Nārada to control them and to be ever pleasing
to her husband. By this she left the strict path of chastity;
offered gifts to the sage who refused them on the plea of
his plenty.
