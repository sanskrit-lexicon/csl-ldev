{%Satyavrata%} (I)¦ — a Rājaṛṣi of Draviḍadeśa, born as the
son of Vivasvat, the future Vaivasvata Manu; once when he
was performing his ablutions a fish fell into his hands. He
reared it in a jar and as it grew big it was left in a pond.
It grew bigger and was taken to a number of lakes and rivers
and finally to the sea. Addressed by the king the fish
revealed his true form and warned him against the forth-
coming deluge. During the floods Satyavrata, as directed by
Matsya Hari, got with the sages, into the ark, creepers and
plants and seeds and tied the ship to the horn of the fish.
His praise of Hari; heard the {%Matsya Purāṇa samhitā%} from
Hari and after the deluge became Vaivasvata Manu, (s.v.);<sup>1</sup>
