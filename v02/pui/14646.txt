{%Śunaśśepha%} (I)¦ — the second son of Ajigarta (Satyavati
and Ṛcīka) purchased by Rohita and used by Hariścandra as
a sacrificial animal in the place of his son. Adopted as son
by Viśvāmitra. When his first fifty sons refused to recognise
him as their brother, they were cursed to be Mlecchas. The
younger fifty agreed to regard him as their brother and were
blessed. He is Śuna to Bhṛgu family and Devarāta to the
Gādhi line. His advent with the Kauśika family distin-
guished it from the Viśvāmitras; compared to Prahlāda.
