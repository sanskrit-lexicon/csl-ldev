{%Raurava%} (I)¦ — one of the 28 hells ever burning and
under the earth; he who is self-centred and accumulates
wealth at the cost of others suffers here; especially from
animals, called Rurus (s.v) more cruel than serpents.<sup>1</sup>
False witnesses, men who are partial and speak untruth,
people guilty of infanticide and of incendiarism go to this;
also {%mahāraurava;%}<sup>2</sup> those who perform rituals with joy and
wrath also go here; below this is the {%tapa.%}<sup>3</sup>
