{%Hiṃsā%} (II)¦ — one of the five heinous sins — narrated to
Indra by Bṛhaspati; it is a sin against men, women, animals,
and creatures of all sorts. Exceptions are given. Any man of
any caste or any animal attacking may be attacked and killed
in self-defence; this applies to family members also; wild
animals like lions and tigers may be killed by the King for
the benefit of Gods and Brahmans, and not for self-enjoyment;
Bhagavatī Māyā created men and Gods and 14 kinds of ani-
mals as also sacrifices and ordered the worship of Gods by
sacrificing Paśu to get oneself blessed with health and wealth;
Paśus may be killed for Gods, Pitṛs, and for feeding great
and respectable persons; in times of danger no sin in the
eating of flesh by Brahmans; animals could be sacrificed in
honour of Śakti.
