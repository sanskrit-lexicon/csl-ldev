{%Cyavana%} (II)¦ — a son of Śukra and Paulomi;<sup>1</sup> when he
<div n="lb"/>was engaged in {%tapas%} he was covered by an anthill. His
<div n="lb"/>eyes were seen through two holes therein. Once Sukanyā
<div n="lb"/>who came there with her father saw two luminous objects
<div n="lb"/>in the anthill and pierced them with a thorn. This resulted
<div n="lb"/>in blood flowing from the eyes. The king asked the sage's
<div n="lb"/>pardon and offered his daughter in marriage to him. Having
<div n="lb"/>married a princess, the sage requested Aśvins who were on
<div n="lb"/>a visit to him, to make him a youth. They advised him to
<div n="lb"/>bathe in a {%siddha%} lake nearby. He thus found himself
<div n="lb"/>thoroughly changed. With him Sukanyā enjoyed life. Her
<div n="lb"/>father came there some time after and was not aware of the
<div n="lb"/>change in the sage's form. He took him to be a paramour
<div n="lb"/>and scolded his daughter. When he came to know the fact
<div n="lb"/>he was much pleased. In the {%yajña%} performed Cyavana
<div n="lb"/>offered {%soma%} to Aśvins who were so far denied a share, being
<div n="lb"/>physicians. Indra resented this and wanted to kill Cyavana.
<div n="lb"/>But the latter's act was accepted by all as a precedent.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Father of Āpravānam and Dadhica.<sup>3</sup>
