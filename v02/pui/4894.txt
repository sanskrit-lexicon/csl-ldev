{%Cyavana%} (II)¦ — a son of Śukra and Paulomi;<sup>1</sup> when he
was engaged in {%tapas%} he was covered by an anthill. His
eyes were seen through two holes therein. Once Sukanyā
who came there with her father saw two luminous objects
in the anthill and pierced them with a thorn. This resulted
in blood flowing from the eyes. The king asked the sage's
pardon and offered his daughter in marriage to him. Having
married a princess, the sage requested Aśvins who were on
a visit to him, to make him a youth. They advised him to
bathe in a {%siddha%} lake nearby. He thus found himself
thoroughly changed. With him Sukanyā enjoyed life. Her
father came there some time after and was not aware of the
change in the sage's form. He took him to be a paramour
and scolded his daughter. When he came to know the fact
he was much pleased. In the {%yajña%} performed Cyavana
offered {%soma%} to Aśvins who were so far denied a share, being
physicians. Indra resented this and wanted to kill Cyavana.
But the latter's act was accepted by all as a precedent.<sup>2</sup>
Father of Āpravānam and Dadhica.<sup>3</sup>
