<div n="P"/>Originating from the foot of Viṣṇu and watering the
region of the moon falls from heaven into Brahmā's city;
issuing from the nail of the great toe of Hari's left foot;
Dhruva holds her in his crown; the seven sages perform
austerities with her waters; issuing again from the moon she
falls on Sumeru and thence to the four quarters of the earth;
hearing of her, the desire to go to Gangā, see, touch, bathe in
her waters — all purify a person; falling in four directions,
takes the names of Śītā, Alakanandā, Cakṣu and Bhadrā.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Effort made by Amśumān, Dilīpa and Bhagīratha and
hence her name Bhāgīrathī. Held up by Hara and then let;
flowed in seven streams through several territories in the
