{%Śatadhanus%} (III)¦ — a king of yore; his wife Śaivyā, a
<div n="lb"/>woman of piety; both worshipped Janārdhana; after fasting on
<div n="lb"/>the Kārttika full moon day and bath in the Bhāgīrathī, they
<div n="lb"/>met a heretic, a friend of the king's military preceptor; he talk-
<div n="lb"/>ed to him but she looked at the sun; soon the king died and she
<div n="lb"/>ascended the funeral pyre; for the sin of talking to a heretic
<div n="lb"/>he was born as a dog in Vidiśa and his wife as a daughter
<div n="lb"/>of the king of Kāśī; she had a knowledge of her former birth
<div n="lb"/>and accepted the dog for her husband; when the dog remem-
<div n="lb"/>bered his former condition, he fell dead in a forest and was
<div n="lb"/>born as a jackal in the Kolāhala hill; the daughter of the king
<div n="lb"/>of Kāśī repaired to the mountain when he remembered his
<div n="lb"/>previous birth and was born as a wolf; again the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of the king of Kāśī met him; remembering his former state
<div n="lb"/>he was born as a vulture, crow and a peacock; when she
<div n="lb"/>bathed him during the sacrificial bath of Janaka he was born
<div n="lb"/>as the son of Janaka. Then a svayamvara was held, she
<div n="lb"/>married him, lived as his queen and attained heaven. See
<div n="lb"/>Śaivyā.
<div n="P"/>Vi. III. 18. 53-95.
