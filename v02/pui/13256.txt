{%Viśvāmitra%} (II)¦ — (Viśvaratha-{%Vā. P.%}): a son of Gādhi
and Kuśika (Kucika gotra-{%Vā. P.%}). Though born a
Kṣatriya, by his tapas he obtained brahmanhood. He had
101 sons. The middle one was known Madhucchandas and
hence all sons bore that common name. He asked his sons
to regard Sunaśśepa as their eldest brother. The first fifty
refused and were cursed to become mlecchas. Madhucchan-
das and the younger fifty agreed to adopt Śunaśśepa. Visvā-
mitra blessed them. He had eight other sons like Aṣṭaka.
Owing to divisions among his sons, the Kauśika family be-
came different from the Viśvāmitras. There was a change
of pravara since adoption was introduced. Father of Śakun-
talā through Ūrvaśī.<sup>1</sup> Helped Triśanku to go to heaven with
