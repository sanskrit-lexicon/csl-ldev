{%Suyajña%} (II)¦ — a king of Uśīnaras, fell in battle. His
relations and queens bemoaned his loss bitterly beating their
breasts. At this Yama appeared before them in the form of
a child and demonstrated the instability of life, comparable
only to a dream. Even ages of mourning will not help the
dead man to come back. Saying this he disappeared. This
impressed them so much that they retired to forest after
performing funeral obsequies.
