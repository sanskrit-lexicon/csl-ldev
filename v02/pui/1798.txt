<div n="lb"/>and a minister of Vṛṣṇis. Requested by Kṛṣṇa, he took a mes-
<div n="lb"/>sage to Nanda and Gopis of Vraja, where he was duly wel-
<div n="lb"/>comed by Nanda. The latter said that he believed with
<div n="lb"/>Garga, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to be gods when Yaśodā narrated
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's exploits as a child. The conversation lasted all
<div n="lb"/>night. After his morning prayers Gopis surrounded him
<div n="lb"/>and asked whether Kṛṣṇa was well and remembered them.
<div n="lb"/>Uddhava was struck with their devotion and told them of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's promised visit in the near future. After spending
<div n="lb"/>some months when Gopis entertained him on {%Kṛṣṇalīlā,%}

<div n="lb"/>miracles and how he persuaded Nanda to perform {%gosava.%}
<div n="lb"/>He narrated the heroic deeds of Kṛṣṇa and the destruction

<div n="lb"/>always meditating on Hari. In the course of the dialogue
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa related the conversation between a Yadu and a Brāh-
