{%Karavīrapura%}¦ — at the foot of Gomanta hill and under
a chieftain Śṛgālavāsudeva. The latter rose against Kṛṣṇa
and Rāma who occupied the city after killing him. Welcome
by its citizens. Spoils and slaves sent to Mathurā. Kṛṣṇa
and Rāma lived here for four months. Pursued by Jarā-
sandha, the brothers fled to this city and after taking rest for
the night got up the hill before daybreak. Not visited by
Vasudeva by order of Kaṃsa.
