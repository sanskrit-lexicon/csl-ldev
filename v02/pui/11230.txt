{%Yavana%}¦ — an asura who, induced by Nārada besieged
Mathurā with three crores of {%mlecchas;%} saw Kṛṣṇa and ran
[Page3-020+ 37]
towards him when he fled to a cave. Yavana followed him
and in the cave saw somebody sleeping; thought it was
Kṛṣṇa and kicked him, when he woke up and burnt the
asura to ashes by his energy. The sleeping person was
Mucukunda (s.v.).<sup>1</sup> Thus he was vanquished by Kṛṣṇa.<sup>2</sup>
