{%Durvāsa%} (I)¦ — a son of Atri and an younger brother
<div n="lb"/>of Dattātreya;<sup>1</sup> an {%amśa%} of Śiva;<sup>2</sup> appeared before Ambarīṣa
<div n="lb"/>who was about to break his {%dvādasi%} fast; agreed to accept
<div n="lb"/>his hospitality, went to the river for bath and tarried there;
<div n="lb"/>finding the {%muhūrta%} for {%pāraṇa%} (break-fast) drawing to a
<div n="lb"/>close, the king broke his fast with some water. Coming to
<div n="lb"/>know of this on his return, the sage produced a flaming
<div n="lb"/>spirit to attack him. But Hari's {%cakra%} burnt it down and
<div n="lb"/>turned towards the sage, who ran for succour to Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Viṣṇu. All of them were unable to help; but Hari
<div n="lb"/>advised him to meet Ambarīṣa and apologise to him.<sup>3</sup> This
<div n="lb"/>he did and was set at liberty. After partaking the meals with
<div n="lb"/>him, he returned to Brahmaloka;<sup>4</sup> blessed Pṛtha with secret
<div n="lb"/>{%mantras%} to summon gods.<sup>5</sup> Through him Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>planned to destroy the Pāṇḍavas by inciting him to go to
<div n="lb"/>them and ask for a feast. But Kṛṣṇa protected them on the
<div n="lb"/>occasion.<sup>6</sup> In the course of his sojourn he met a Vidyā-
[Page2-106+ 23]
<div n="lb"/>dhara maid with a garland given to her by the Devī; took it
<div n="lb"/>from her and presented it to Indra who put it on his elephant,
<div n="lb"/>who in turn threw it on the ground and trampled upon it.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this, the sage cursed him to be lost to all fortune.<sup>7</sup>
