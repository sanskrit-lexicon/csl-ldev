{%Narmadā%} (I)¦ — a mahānadi of the Bhāratavarṣa; a R.
<div n="lb"/>from the Ṛkṣa or Ṛṣyavat hills: (Vindhyan ranges) on its
<div n="lb"/>northern bank was Bhṛgukaccha: a sacred river that sur-
<div n="lb"/>vived the {%antarakṣaya,%} sacred to Pitṛs and for śrāddha; in
<div n="lb"/>the neighbourhood of the Haihaya kingdom.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>The scene of battle between Vṛtra and Indra; here
<div n="lb"/>Rukmi challenged Kṛṣṇa when the latter was crossing the
<div n="lb"/>stream with Rukmiṇī; its current was stopped by Kārta-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>The mahātmya of; just like Mārkaṇḍeya this river does
<div n="lb"/>not get lost in the time of the deluge; in Kalinga, near the
<div n="lb"/>Amarakaṇṭaka hill; has a number of {%tīrthas%} like Jaleśvara,
<div n="lb"/>Rudrakoṭi, Amrakaṇṭaka, Kapila and Viśalya Karaṇi. The
<div n="lb"/>devotee bathing in any {%tīrtha%} on the Narmadā gets the
<div n="lb"/>benefit of performing an Aśvamedha sacrifice.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Lord enshrined here is Maheśvara who devised
<div n="lb"/>plans to vanquish Bāṇāsura of Tripura with the help of
<div n="lb"/>Nārada. The Lord was much concerned about virtuous
<div n="lb"/>ladies in Tripura and Nārada undertook to delude them by
<div n="lb"/>proclaiming ordinances to ladies to give gifts to poor and
<div n="lb"/>deserving Brahmanas.<sup>4</sup> Śiva got ready for war here and
<div n="lb"/>attacked Tripura with incendiary materials. Out of the
<div n="lb"/>three cities comprising Tripura, (s.v.) two fell down
<div n="lb"/>reduced to ashes. The first city became converted into the
<div n="lb"/>Śri Śaila hill, and the second Amarakaṇṭaka hill, both
<div n="lb"/>adorned by the Siddhas, Gandharvas and so on. The Lord
<div n="lb"/>enshrined at the latter is Jvāleśvara. The third city was
<div n="lb"/>left unconsumed.<sup>5</sup>
[Page2-211+ 38]
<div n="P"/>It is said that at the confluence of the Narmadā with
<div n="lb"/>Kāverī, Kubera practised tapas in honour of Śiva and be-
<div n="lb"/>came the Lord of the Yakṣas. A bath here is equal to that
<div n="lb"/>at the confluence of the Gangā and the Yamunā.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>To the north of the Narmadā are a number of {%tīrthams%}
<div n="lb"/>like Mantreśvara, Garjanā, Amrātaka, Karanyā, Kuṇḍeś-
<div n="lb"/>vara and others. A bath in each of them rids one of all
<div n="lb"/>sins. Then follows other {%tīrthas,%} all equally sacred, includ-
<div n="lb"/>ing Rāvaṇeśvara, the shrines of Kubera, Ahalyātīrtha, and
<div n="lb"/>the shrine of Janārdana. Here Agni, Dharmarāja and
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu practised asceticism and attained emancipation. A
<div n="lb"/>visit to Śuklatīrtham sacred to Rājaṛṣi Cāṇakya washes off
<div n="lb"/>all the sins of a life time. Any gift given here bears rich
<div n="lb"/>fruits.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>Among the other sacred places can be mentioned the
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgutīrtham, Kankhala, where Garuḍa once was in
<div n="lb"/>austerities, Kanyātīrtha, Pitāmahatīrtha, and Svargadvāra-
<div n="lb"/>tīrtham; He who reads or listens to the glory of the
<div n="lb"/>Namadā has his wishes fulfilled whatever be his caste.<sup>8</sup> On
<div n="lb"/>its banks Purukutsa heard the {%Viṣṇu Purāṇa%} from the
<div n="lb"/>sages.<sup>9</sup> Penance here by Asuras, who became converted into
<div n="lb"/>Arhats.<sup>10</sup> Marubhūmīviṣaya on the N. ruled by Śūdras and
<div n="lb"/>other castes.<sup>11</sup>
