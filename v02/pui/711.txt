{%Aṃbarīṣa%} (I)¦ — the son of Nābhāga. A devotee of Hari.
The curse of Durvāsas proved ineffective in his case. Though
lord of seven continents, Ambarīṣa knew that glory was
perishable. He devoted himself to the service of Hari,
and got to know the power of His {%yoga.%} A saintly king.
Performed the {%Aśvamedha%} in a desert region so as to compel
R. Sarasvati flow back towards it. Pleased with him, Hari
presented his {%Cakra%} to him. He observed the {%Dvādasī%}
{%vrata,%} for a year at the end of which he gave gifts to Brāh-
maṇas and was preparing to feed them. There then came
Durvāsas who agreed to be fed. He went to the Yamunā
for bath and was engaged in contemplating on Brahman.
The time for breakfast came and the sage did not return.

So the king broke his fast with only water and waited food
expecting the sage's arrival. The sage on his return found
that the king had broken his fast, and grew angry and created
a flaming goddess to attack him. Hari's {%Cakra%} burnt her,
turned towards the sage who ran everywhere and to the
{%Trimūrtis%} in vain.<sup>1</sup> Advised by Hari, the sage apologised
to the king who prayed to the {%Cakra%} and set the sage at
liberty. The king who had not taken food requested him
to accept his hospitality which Durvāsas gladly did. Bless-
ing the king, the sage went back to Brahmaloka. Later the
king bestowed his kingdom on his sons and retired to the
forest for a life of penance and prayer.<sup>2</sup> Had three sons
Virūpa and others.<sup>3</sup> A {%mantrakṛt%} who made the 16 great
gifts.<sup>4</sup>
