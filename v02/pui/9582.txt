{%Bhāradvāja%} (III)¦ — performed śrāddha at Kaśyapapada
and found two hands black and white protruding, and feeling
a doubt asked his mother who said the black hand was his
father; but the white hand contested that he was the Pro-
creator; the black said, that he was the owner of kṣetra;
Bhāradvāja found her of bad character.
