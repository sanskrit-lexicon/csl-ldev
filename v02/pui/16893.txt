{%Sauvīrarāja%}¦ — the gate-keeper of this king chose him for
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice to Kāli, who knowing Bharata's spiritual eminence
<div n="lb"/>turned against the servant of the king; then engaged Bha-
<div n="lb"/>rata born as Brahman, as palanquin bearer; when he went
<div n="lb"/>to the hermitage of Kapila he did not bear it well, and when
<div n="lb"/>asked once and twice the Brahman burst out into high philo-
<div n="lb"/>sophy which the king learnt from him and renounced all
<div n="lb"/>kinds of distinction.
<div n="P"/>Vi. II. 13. 48 to end; chh. 14-16.
