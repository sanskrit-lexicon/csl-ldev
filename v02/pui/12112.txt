{%Vajrāṅga%}¦ — a son of Diti after her penance and
father of Asura Tāraka who gave trouble to the devas;
while a boy, under the orders of his mother, had Indra
bound and placed before Diti; Brahmā and Kaśyapa medi-
ated and set him free; Brahmā gave him for wife a mind-
born daughter, Varāṅgī, with whom he went to penance;
when Varāṅgī was engaged in {%tapas%} Indra threatened her
with several guises of the monkey, serpent, jackal, etc.,
which made her weep in sorrow and fear; meanwhile Vaj-
rāṅga's penance had ended and Brahmā had blessed him. He
came in search of his wife whom he found crying in fear.
[Page3-140+ 33]
She spoke of the insult offered by Indra and asked for a
son, Tāraka, able to vanquish Indra. Then again he
entered into a terrible vow when Brahmā blessed him with
the son desired by his spouse. Tāraka was born and great
festivities were held in his honour. Soon he was crowned
king of the Asura world.
