{%Vajrāṅga%}¦ — a son of Diti after her penance and
<div n="lb"/>father of Asura Tāraka who gave trouble to the devas;
<div n="lb"/>while a boy, under the orders of his mother, had Indra
<div n="lb"/>bound and placed before Diti; Brahmā and Kaśyapa medi-
<div n="lb"/>ated and set him free; Brahmā gave him for wife a mind-
<div n="lb"/>born daughter, Varāṅgī, with whom he went to penance;
<div n="lb"/>when Varāṅgī was engaged in {%tapas%} Indra threatened her
<div n="lb"/>with several guises of the monkey, serpent, jackal, etc.,
<div n="lb"/>which made her weep in sorrow and fear; meanwhile Vaj-
<div n="lb"/>rāṅga's penance had ended and Brahmā had blessed him. He
<div n="lb"/>came in search of his wife whom he found crying in fear.
[Page3-140+ 33]
<div n="lb"/>She spoke of the insult offered by Indra and asked for a
<div n="lb"/>son, Tāraka, able to vanquish Indra. Then again he
<div n="lb"/>entered into a terrible vow when Brahmā blessed him with
<div n="lb"/>the son desired by his spouse. Tāraka was born and great
<div n="lb"/>festivities were held in his honour. Soon he was crowned
<div n="lb"/>king of the Asura world.
<div n="P"/>M. 146. 5, 41 ff; 147. 1-29.
