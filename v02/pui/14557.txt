<div n="lb"/>in Prahlāda's coronation. A Brahmaṛṣi: Heard of the in-
<div n="lb"/>sult offered to his daughter by Śarmiṣṭhā, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>the ruler Vṛṣaparvan and left the capital. The Purohita of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣaparvan, the latter made him stay offering to make his
<div n="lb"/>daughter a slave of Devayāṇī. In offering the latter to
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti, he asked him not to share his bed with Śarmiṣṭhā,
<div n="lb"/>cursed Yayāti to become aged for having shared his bed with
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā, and on an appeal mitigated it by saying that he
<div n="lb"/>could exchange his old age with youth of another if he found
<div n="lb"/>one to accept the exchange;<sup>2</sup> joined Soma in Tārakāmaya
<div n="lb"/>war: blessed the Asuras in this war: fought with Bṛhaspati
<div n="lb"/>in a Devāsura battle.<sup>3</sup> Brought back to life the unconscious
<div n="lb"/>Bali by Sañjīvinī Vidya. Presented Bali with an unfading
<div n="lb"/>garland of flowers; knowing Vāmana to be Hari, warned
<div n="lb"/>Bali from agreeing to his request. Bali would not hear, and
<div n="lb"/>Śukra cursed him to lose all Śrī. At the bidding of Hari com-
<div n="lb"/>pleted the Yajña begun by Bali.<sup>4</sup> The third Vedavyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>Heard the Purāṇa from Vāyu and told it to Bṛhaspati;<sup>5</sup> wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped Sthānu with severe penance; born in Tiṣyanakṣatra:
<div n="lb"/>married mind-born daughter of Pitṛs (Somapas) and father
<div n="lb"/>of 4 sons, Tvaṣṭri, Varatri, Śaṇḍa and Marka;<sup>6</sup> cursed the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras when they lost their empire, and Yajña came to the
<div n="lb"/>side of Devas. Asura's appeal and Śukra's penance to Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Finding the Asuras having no Ācārya, the Devas attacked
<div n="lb"/>them who appealed to Śukra's mother. Viṣṇu at the instance
<div n="lb"/>of Indra slew her, a woman and a wife of Bhṛgu, for which
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu was cursed to be born on earth as man seven times.
<div n="lb"/>Indra then set up his daughter Jayantī to serve Śukra and
<div n="lb"/>earn his goodwill. Pleased with her service, Śukra agreed to
<div n="lb"/>live with her as husband for ten years. After this period,
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati assumed his form and deluded the Asuras. Śukra
<div n="lb"/>who grew angry cursed the Asuras at which Bṛhaspati felt
<div n="lb"/>happy and threw off his disguise. They appealed to Śukra
<div n="lb"/>for help once again or threatened to leave for Rasātalam. He
<div n="lb"/>managed to get back their kingdom in the epoch of Sāvarṇi

<div n="lb"/>Śiva;<sup>11</sup> encouraged Asuras by giving them his pupils Śaṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Marka for assistance. But his curse tells when the pupils
<div n="lb"/>desert them. Both were bought off by gods who offered
<div n="lb"/>them a status in sacrifices. This resulted in the helplessness
<div n="lb"/>of Asuras who entered Rasātalam;<sup>12</sup> appointed Purohita of
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras; expert in Sañjīvinī vidyā, revived the dead back
<div n="lb"/>to life;<sup>13</sup> taught Kaca, son of Bṛhaspati;<sup>14</sup> has ruled that the
