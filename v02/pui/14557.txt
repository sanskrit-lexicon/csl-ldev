in Prahlāda's coronation. A Brahmaṛṣi: Heard of the in-
sult offered to his daughter by Śarmiṣṭhā, the daughter of
the ruler Vṛṣaparvan and left the capital. The Purohita of
Vṛṣaparvan, the latter made him stay offering to make his
daughter a slave of Devayāṇī. In offering the latter to
Yayāti, he asked him not to share his bed with Śarmiṣṭhā,
cursed Yayāti to become aged for having shared his bed with
Śarmiṣṭhā, and on an appeal mitigated it by saying that he
could exchange his old age with youth of another if he found
one to accept the exchange;<sup>2</sup> joined Soma in Tārakāmaya
war: blessed the Asuras in this war: fought with Bṛhaspati
in a Devāsura battle.<sup>3</sup> Brought back to life the unconscious
Bali by Sañjīvinī Vidya. Presented Bali with an unfading
garland of flowers; knowing Vāmana to be Hari, warned
Bali from agreeing to his request. Bali would not hear, and
Śukra cursed him to lose all Śrī. At the bidding of Hari com-
pleted the Yajña begun by Bali.<sup>4</sup> The third Vedavyāsa.
Heard the Purāṇa from Vāyu and told it to Bṛhaspati;<sup>5</sup> wor-
shipped Sthānu with severe penance; born in Tiṣyanakṣatra:
married mind-born daughter of Pitṛs (Somapas) and father
of 4 sons, Tvaṣṭri, Varatri, Śaṇḍa and Marka;<sup>6</sup> cursed the
Asuras when they lost their empire, and Yajña came to the
side of Devas. Asura's appeal and Śukra's penance to Śiva.
Finding the Asuras having no Ācārya, the Devas attacked
them who appealed to Śukra's mother. Viṣṇu at the instance
of Indra slew her, a woman and a wife of Bhṛgu, for which
Viṣṇu was cursed to be born on earth as man seven times.
Indra then set up his daughter Jayantī to serve Śukra and
earn his goodwill. Pleased with her service, Śukra agreed to
live with her as husband for ten years. After this period,
Bṛhaspati assumed his form and deluded the Asuras. Śukra
who grew angry cursed the Asuras at which Bṛhaspati felt
happy and threw off his disguise. They appealed to Śukra
for help once again or threatened to leave for Rasātalam. He
managed to get back their kingdom in the epoch of Sāvarṇi

Śiva;<sup>11</sup> encouraged Asuras by giving them his pupils Śaṇḍa
and Marka for assistance. But his curse tells when the pupils
