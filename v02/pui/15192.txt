{%Satyabhāmā%}¦ — (see Satyā) a daughter of Satrājit
(Bhangakāra-{%M. P.%}). The latter had mistakenly suspected
Kṛṣṇa of having murdered his brother, and to make amends,
gave his daughter in marriage to Kṛṣṇa though Akrūra and
others had sought her hand before. Mother of 6 sons and
4 daughters among whom were Bhānu and Bhaumarikā.
Terrified at the murder of her father by<sup>1</sup> Śatadhanvan
(s.v.) she caused the dead body to be preserved in oil and
went to Hāstinapuram to inform Kṛṣṇa. Saw Syamantaka
with Akrūra and coveted it. Welcomed to Indraprastha by
Draupadī;<sup>2</sup> narrated to her the circumstances under which
she married Kṛṣṇa;<sup>3</sup> went with Kṛṣṇa during his expedition to
Naraka's city, and then to Indra's abode. Embraced and
blessed by Aditī; complained to Kṛṣṇa that Indrāṇī did not
accord her proper welcome and insisted on the Pārijāta
being taken to Dvārakā. Defeated Kubera who attracted her
husband and was praised by Kṛṣṇa for her valour;<sup>4</sup> observed
Kalyāṇini vratam;<sup>5</sup> took away the Pārijāta; Indra fought for
it but was defeated; Satyabhāmā gave it back to him saying
that she wanted to teach a lesson to Indrāṇī; returned to
Dvārakā with the Pārijāta presented by Indra.<sup>6</sup>
