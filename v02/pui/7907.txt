{%Pitṛsarga%}¦ — once the whole world was covered with
darkness; there were no air, no earth, no planets, no direc-
tions, no sun, no moon, no days or nights; the single Brahmā
out of tapoyoga created worlds of Vedas and other devas;
there were seven classes of which three had no form and
four had forms: Devas and earth and rains; then śrāddhas.
