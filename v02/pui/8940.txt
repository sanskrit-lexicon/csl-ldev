{%Balāhaka%} (VI)¦ — the first seven sons of Kīkasa, and all
<div n="lb"/>commanders to lead 300 akṣauhiṇis; started against Lalitā's
<div n="lb"/>army, rode on the great eagle, Samhāragupta, followed by
<div n="lb"/>his brothers who rode on different animals; all of them were
[Page2-468+ 31]
<div n="lb"/>sun worshippers and obtained the vow that whoever would
<div n="lb"/>see them would be dragged by their bright eyes and would
<div n="lb"/>not see them straight; so they created confusion among the
<div n="lb"/>ranks of the Śakti; Lalitā ordered Daṇḍanātha Tiraskaraṇikā
<div n="lb"/>to create darkness so that the dānavas might not see; it was
<div n="lb"/>done, but its effect was short-lived; and when they were
<div n="lb"/>blinded, their heads were chopped off.
<div n="P"/>Br. IV. 24. 4-92.
