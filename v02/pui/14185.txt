{%Śaryāti%} (I)¦ — a son of Vaivasvata Manu. A saintly king
<div n="lb"/>who gave a discourse on the second day of Angiraś Yajña.
<div n="lb"/>Father of twins Ānarta and Śukanyā: with the latter he
<div n="lb"/>went once to the āśrama of Cyavana. In an ant-hill the girl
<div n="lb"/>saw two luminous objects and little knowing that they were
<div n="lb"/>the eyes of the sage, she pricked them by a thorn. There was
<div n="lb"/>an overflow of blood and this disabled all the attendants of
<div n="lb"/>the king from answering calls of nature. On enquiry the
<div n="lb"/>king found out the mistake committed by his daughter and
<div n="lb"/>persuaded the sage to excuse her, by offering her in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to him. Taking leave of them he returned to the city.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Desirous of performing a sacrifice, Śaryāti called on the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of his son-in-law after some time and found a young
<div n="lb"/>man seated on his daughter's side little knowing that the
[Page3-392+ 30]
<div n="lb"/>sage had changed his form due to the blessings of Aśvins:
<div n="lb"/>the king admonished his daughter for her misbehaviour. But
<div n="lb"/>when he heard how Cyavana got back his youth, he was
<div n="lb"/>pleased and hugged his daughter.<sup>2</sup> Father of three sons:
<div n="lb"/>his greed for more territory.
