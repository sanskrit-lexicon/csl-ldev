{%Balarāma%}¦ — a son of Vasudeva<sup>1</sup> and Rohiṇī and an {%amśa%}
<div n="lb"/>of Hari; (also Baladeva, Balabhadra, Sīrāyudha); the
<div n="lb"/>{%Dhāma%} of Hari in the womb of Devakī transferred to that
<div n="lb"/>of Rohiṇī by Yogamāyā; on account of this he is Sankar-
<div n="lb"/>ṣaṇa; also Rāma on account of his pleasant personality and
<div n="lb"/>Bala on account of his strength; his {%nāmakaraṇam;%}<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>was bewildered at Baka seizing Kṛṣṇa; became glad at
<div n="lb"/>his escape; entered the palmyra grove, vanquished the Asura
<div n="lb"/>Dhenuka and his kin and gladdened the cow-herds; advised
<div n="lb"/>Nanda and others to keep cool when Kṛṣṇa was enclosed in
<div n="lb"/>the coils of the reptile, and stopped their getting into the
<div n="lb"/>pool of Kālīya; his joy at Kṛṣṇa's escape from Kālīya; was
<div n="lb"/>carried by Pralamba on his back when he won in a certain
<div n="lb"/>game; but finding him to be an Asura in the guise of a
<div n="lb"/>gopa, he knocked his head with his fist and killed
<div n="lb"/>him for which the Devas praised him;<sup>2</sup> his surprise
<div n="lb"/>at Kṛṣṇa's holding aloft the Govardhana; was in
<div n="lb"/>charge of the women rescued by Kṛṣṇa from Śankha-
<div n="lb"/>cūḍa and was presented with the Cūḍāmaṇi of Śankhacūḍa.<sup>3</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Akrūra's prostration before him; welcomed Akrūra in the
<div n="lb"/>proper way and fed him on choice preparations; followed
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa to the Mathurā city where he was honoured by its
<div n="lb"/>womenfolk; saw Kṛṣṇa's exploits in the city and returned

<div n="lb"/>enjoying music and drink, at Raivataka hill, he killed Dvivida
<div n="lb"/>(s.v.) who offended him; returned with the blessings of the

<div n="P"/>When the Yadus decided war with the Kurus, Rāma
<div n="lb"/>did not like it and thought he could bring about peace; went
<div n="lb"/>to Hastinagara and was welcomed by Duryodhana and
<div n="lb"/>others; he communicated to them Ugrasena's command to
<div n="lb"/>release Sāmba; the Kurus laughed and said that slippers
<div n="lb"/>would sometimes usurp the place of crown; Ugrasena was
<div n="lb"/>only a king by sufferance and hence he could not send a
<div n="lb"/>command; enraged at their inordinate pride, he decided to
<div n="lb"/>lift up the city and throw it into the Ganges; the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>prayed for mercy and promised to send Lakṣmaṇā with
<div n="lb"/>Sāmba together with a large dowry of horses, elephants,
<div n="lb"/>etc.; with these Rāma returned to Dvārakā;<sup>6</sup> was con-
<div n="lb"/>sulted by Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa took leave of him to go to
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura; did not like the war between the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kauravas and went on a pilgrimage; after visiting
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāsa, Sarasvatī, Yamunā, and Gangā he reached Nai-
<div n="lb"/>miṣa where he was welcomed by all the sages; Romahar-
<div n="lb"/>ṣaṇa the Sūta did not rise up to honour him at which Rāma
<div n="lb"/>got angry and fatally hurt him; seeing this the sages called
<div n="lb"/>it {%adharma%} and {%brahmahatya%} and called upon Rāma for
[Page2-465+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>expiation; Romaharṣaṇa's son was blessed; the sages asked
<div n="lb"/>Rāma to kill the Asura Balvala and go on a pilgrimage for
<div n="lb"/>a year when he could be purified; after killing Balvala, and
<div n="lb"/>receiving from the sages presents of Vaijayantī, clothes,
