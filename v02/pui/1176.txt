{%Ājagara%}¦ — a sage. Praḥlāda saw him one day lying on
the bare ground on a cliff of the Sahya hills, and bowed to
[Page1-149+ 25]
him. Praḥlāda asked the sage how he who had no com-
forts was able to maintain a sound body. The sage replied
that he had renounced all desires, learning renunciation
from the bee and contentment from the serpent, while his
mind was ever absorbed in Hari.
