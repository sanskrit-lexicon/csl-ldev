{%Indra%} (I)¦ — ({%Sahasrākṣa, Devendra,%} etc.). A {%Lokapāla.%}
<div n="lb"/>He and three other Lokapālas have their cities on the Māna-
<div n="lb"/>sottara mountain in Puṣkaradvīpa;<sup>1</sup> worshipped for vigour
<div n="lb"/>of organs.<sup>2</sup> Served as calf for gods to milk from the Earth.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Presented Pṛthu with a crown.<sup>4</sup> Deprived Pṛthu of his
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial horse during the hundredth {%Aśvamedha.%} Urged by
<div n="lb"/>Atri, Pṛthu's son pursued Indra, when the latter aban-
<div n="lb"/>doned the house and disappeared. A second time Indra
<div n="lb"/>deprived Pṛthu of his horse; when the king's men pursued
<div n="lb"/>him, he left the horse and went away in disguise. This
<div n="lb"/>enraged Pṛthu, who aimed his arrow at Indra but was
<div n="lb"/>pacified by Brahmā in the name of {%dharma.%} A reconcilia-
<div n="lb"/>tion was effected when Pṛthu embraced him.<sup>5</sup> Invested
<div n="lb"/>Vijitāśva with power of moving about unseen by others.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Jealous of Ṛṣabha, refused rains for his kingdom Ajanābha.
<div n="lb"/>Bestowed Jayantī on him.<sup>7</sup> During Hiraṇyakaśipu's absence
<div n="lb"/>at Mandara hill, Indra captured his queen and took her to
<div n="lb"/>his heavenly abode. Nārada intervened and set her at
<div n="lb"/>liberty.<sup>8</sup> Took up his {%vajra%} against Cyavana for allowing
<div n="lb"/>Aśvins to partake of {%soma%} juice. But Cyavana's {%tapas%} tied
<div n="lb"/>down his arms, when Indra yielded.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Assumed the form of a bull over which Kakustha rode
<div n="lb"/>and defeated Asuras in a battle. Made the crying Mān-
<div n="lb"/>dhāta suckle his finger.<sup>10</sup> Prevented Rohita from entering
[Page1-188+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>his city for six years: Awarded Hariścandra a golden
<div n="lb"/>chariot after his {%Puruṣamedha.%}<sup>11</sup> Robbed Sagara's sacrifi-
<div n="lb"/>cial horse and left it near Kapila's hermitage.<sup>12</sup> Performed
<div n="lb"/>a sacrifice which was attended by Vasiṣṭha.<sup>13</sup> Joined the
<div n="lb"/>gods in Tārakāmaya war.<sup>14</sup> Asked Gandharvas to take back
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī living with Purūravas.<sup>15</sup> Helped by Rāji, gave back
<div n="lb"/>his kingdom. After his death, his sons refused to give back
<div n="lb"/>the kingdom, and Indra slew all of them.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>Cursed by Durvāsa, he lost all fortune. The three
<div n="lb"/>worlds became empty. Varuṇa and other gods conferred
<div n="lb"/>with Brahmā. Finding no means to restore their fortunes,
<div n="lb"/>they repaired to Hari Ajita when Brahmā belauded Hari
<div n="lb"/>as {%mahāvibhūti.%} Hari advised them to secure Bali's
<div n="lb"/>alliance.<sup>17</sup> When the Devāsura war broke out, the gods
<div n="lb"/>fought with Bali who defeated them. At that time Indra
<div n="lb"/>prayed to Hari for help. Encouraged by the latter, the war
<div n="lb"/>was renewed and Bali was defeated. At this Jambha offered
<div n="lb"/>to fight Indra and disabled his elephant. Mātali supplied a
<div n="lb"/>chariot and Jambha's head was cut off. Namuci, Bala and
<div n="lb"/>Pāka attacked Indra. The latter two were slain. Namuci
<div n="lb"/>proved too much for Indra's {%vajra.%} A voice from the sky
<div n="lb"/>told Indra that Namuci could not be crushed by a wet or dry
<div n="lb"/>thing. Then Indra used {%phena%} (foam) and vanquished him.
<div n="lb"/>Bali in the meantime gathered strength and beseiged Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Indra sought counsel of Bṛhaspati who cared for his welfare,
<div n="lb"/>and as advised by the latter, he abandoned the city.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Got back Heaven from Vāmana-Hari. He took him to
<div n="lb"/>his abode.<sup>19</sup> Defeated by Arjuna who got the {%sabhā%} made
<div n="lb"/>by Maya. Arjuna for a short time shared his throne.
<div n="lb"/>Defeated by Arjuna at Khāṇḍava. His city visited by
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna in the course of a search for the dead children of
<div n="lb"/>the Dvārakā Brāhmaṇa.<sup>20</sup> Was not able to defeat Nivāta
[Page1-189+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>Kavacas.<sup>21</sup> Afraid of Nara's superior powers, sent Kāma
<div n="lb"/>to spoil his {%tapas;%} was struck with fear with the sage's great-
<div n="lb"/>ness;<sup>22</sup> sent nymphs to disturb Mārkaṇḍeya's {%vrata%} but in
<div n="lb"/>vain.<sup>23</sup> Sheltered Takṣaka and was about to be sacrificed
<div n="lb"/>when Bṛhaspati luckily intervened.<sup>24</sup> Said to be afraid of
<div n="lb"/>the Kurus.<sup>25</sup> Attended Varuṇa's sacrifice and Yudhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭhira's.<sup>26</sup> For his sake Hari went to Bali in the disguise of
<div n="lb"/>a Brāhmaṇa.<sup>27</sup> Once he sat with Indrāṇī in his {%sabhā%} sur-
<div n="lb"/>rounded by all gods. In his pride he did not welcome his
<div n="lb"/>preceptor Bṛhaspati in the proper way. The latter went
<div n="lb"/>away home at once and concealed himself from the gods.
<div n="lb"/>On this the Asuras attacked the gods. Indra repented and
<div n="lb"/>on Brahmā's advice appointed Viśvarūpa as his preceptor.
<div n="lb"/>Having been initiated into the {%Vidyā Varma Nārāyaṇātma-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kam,%} he was enjoying his original prosperity. One day
<div n="lb"/>Indra discovered that a part of Viśvarūpa's offerings went to
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras and therefore cut off his head in anger. Thus he
<div n="lb"/>incurred the sin of {%brahmahatyā.%} After a year, in order to
<div n="lb"/>rid himself of it he divided his sin into four parts among
<div n="lb"/>(1) the earth with the boon that dug portion should get
<div n="lb"/>filled up, (2) the waters with the boon of increasing volume
<div n="lb"/>when mixed up, (3) trees with the boon that branches cut
<div n="lb"/>off grow again, and (4) women with the boon of ever
<div n="lb"/>cherishing the passion of love. The saline soil, bubbles and
<div n="lb"/>foam, gum and monthly discharges respectively represent
<div n="lb"/>the {%brahmahatyā%} sin.<sup>28</sup>
<div n="P"/>With {%Vajra%} made of Dadhīci's bones (made by Tvaṣṭr
<div n="lb"/>from sun's {%tejas — Matsya P.%}), Indra attacked Vṛtra as
<div n="lb"/>Rudra attacked Yama. The encounter took place on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Narmadā in the first {%Tretāyuga.%} Battle
<div n="lb"/>described. Seeing his friends escaping in fright, Vṛtra en-
<div n="lb"/>couraged them to stand and fight. He also disabled Indra's
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata, and addressed him at length. Indra cut off one
<div n="lb"/>of his arms. With the remaining arm Vṛtra hit Indra while
<div n="lb"/>the {%Vajra%} slipped from his hands causing concern to the gods.
[Page1-190+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>Encouraged by the straight speech of Vṛtra, Indra took up
<div n="lb"/>his {%Vajra%} and cut off his other arm. Vṛtra swallowed him;
<div n="lb"/>but Indra, the vanquisher of Bala, got out of his stomach
<div n="lb"/>and cut off his head. Indra's regret at the murder of another
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa. The sin of brahmicide, says the legend, took the
<div n="lb"/>disguise of a Caṇḍāla woman and ran towards him in a
<div n="lb"/>terrific form when he entered the lake Mānasa and lived in
<div n="lb"/>the lotus stalks for a thousand years. Invited by Brāhma-
<div n="lb"/>ṇas, he performed an {%Aśvamedha%} and got rid of his sins.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>Father of three sons Jayanta and others through Pau-
<div n="lb"/>lomī. Getting to know that his mother Diti was observing
<div n="lb"/>a vow to get a child to slay him he offered to do service to
<div n="lb"/>her. Once he found her slack in her duty. He entered the
<div n="lb"/>womb and cut the child into seven pieces and each of these
<div n="lb"/>again into seven. At her request he offered to her to give
<div n="lb"/>them the rank of gods, by name {%Maruts,%}<sup>30</sup> who were allowed
<div n="lb"/>to share in the {%yajñas.%} Diti thought of another son Vajrānga
<div n="lb"/>who bound Indra and placed him before her. Was released
<div n="lb"/>on mediation from Brahmā and Kaśyapa.<sup>30a</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Got a gift of {%Maṇiparvata%} of Naraka from Kṛṣṇa.<sup>31</sup> Visited
<div n="lb"/>by Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā. At the latter's wish, {%Pārijāta%}
<div n="lb"/>was removed without any intimation. Indra, induced by
<div n="lb"/>Indrāṇi attacked him with all gods. Kubera, Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>and others were defeated. Indra himself offered resist-
<div n="lb"/>ance. Garuḍa disabled his elephant and Indra retreated.
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā made fun of him ‘Do not run, Lord of Indrāṇī.’
<div n="lb"/>Indra apologised. Kṛṣṇa answered that Indra was not in
<div n="lb"/>the wrong as he (Kṛṣṇa) took the offensive. Indra asked
<div n="lb"/>pardon and begged that his son Bībhatsu be protected.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa told him that {%Pārijāta%} would go back to him when he
<div n="lb"/>left the mortal world. Returned to his city with all gods.<sup>32</sup>
<div n="P"/>The God of rain: Sent torrents of showers on Gokula
<div n="lb"/>when Kṛṣṇa protected his friends by holding up the hill
[Page1-191+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>Govardhana. At this Indra and Surabhi came to visit him.
<div n="lb"/>Indra asked for pardon. Told by Kṛṣṇa that he was humi-
<div n="lb"/>liated for his own good. In the company of Surabhi, Indra
<div n="lb"/>got Kṛṣṇa bathed with the waters of the Gaṅgā and called
<div n="lb"/>him Govinda. Returned to his region.<sup>33</sup>
