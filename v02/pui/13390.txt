hearing of Satī's self-sacrifice to destroy Dakṣa's {%yajña;%} seized
Dakṣa, cut off his head and offered it to Dakṣiṇāgni, and then
set out for Kailāsa. After reconciliation with Śiva, Viṣṇu
was propitiated with Puroḍāśa to get rid of pollution due to
Vīrabhadra's interference in the Yajña;<sup>1</sup> after destroying the
sacrifice was about to destroy the world; Śiva stopped him
and blessed him to be the first of all {%grahas%} by name Aṅgā-
raka;<sup>2</sup> hearing that he came out of the wrath of Paśupati
Dakṣa appeased him by prayers. Śiva rose from the fire
altar and granted him his request that his sacrifice be fruit-
ful when Dakṣa praised him with 1008 names.<sup>3</sup>
