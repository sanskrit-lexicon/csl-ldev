{%Chāyā%} (I)¦ — a daughter of Viśvakarman,<sup>1</sup> a servant-
maid of Samjñā engaged by the latter for her husband. Hence
[Page1-619+ 29]
wife of the sun God without his knowledge and mother of
Śanaiścara and Tapatī during the absence of Samjñā as a
horse. Her sons were Śrutaśrava and Śrutakarma or
Sāvarṇi Manu and Saturn respectively; illtreated Samjñā's
children. Yama protested and was cursed to lose his legs.
He reported to his father who said that they would be
restored after some time. Then he asked Chāyā why she
showed difference between her sons and she spoke the
truth. The sun God flew into a rage and demanded
Tvaṣtā to give up his daughter. He showed the place where
Sarvajñā was and Tvaṣtā reduced his {%tejas.%} On seeing her,
Śukra came through his nostrils from which were born the
Aśvins or Nāsatya and Dasra.<sup>2</sup>
