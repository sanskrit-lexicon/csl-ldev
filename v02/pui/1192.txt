{%Āḍi%}¦ — a son of Asura Andhaka; to wreak vengeance on
<div n="lb"/>{%Śiva%} for having slain his father, he entered the harem of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva in the guise of a snake, and assumed the guise of Umā
<div n="lb"/>before him. He could change his form twice as he liked
<div n="lb"/>owing to a boon from Brahmā; but the second change would
<div n="lb"/>be followed by death. On close examination, Śiva dis-
<div n="lb"/>covered the figure to be the Asura in disguise, threw the
<div n="lb"/>Vajra and slew him.
<div n="P"/>M. 156. 12-37.
