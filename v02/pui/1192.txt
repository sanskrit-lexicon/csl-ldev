{%Āḍi%}¦ — a son of Asura Andhaka; to wreak vengeance on
{%Śiva%} for having slain his father, he entered the harem of
Śiva in the guise of a snake, and assumed the guise of Umā
before him. He could change his form twice as he liked
owing to a boon from Brahmā; but the second change would
be followed by death. On close examination, Śiva dis-
covered the figure to be the Asura in disguise, threw the
Vajra and slew him.
