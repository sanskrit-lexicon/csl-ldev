{%Andhakas%} (II)¦ — the Asuras born of the blood of
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka Asura, hit by the {%pāśupata%} of Rudra. To counter-
<div n="lb"/>act their evil propensities Rudra created a number of {%Mātṛs%}
<div n="lb"/>who could not bring about the desired effect. Hence Vāsu-
<div n="lb"/>deva created a Śuṣkarevatī who brought about their des-
<div n="lb"/>truction by drinking off their blood.
