{%Andhakas%} (II)¦ — the Asuras born of the blood of
Andhaka Asura, hit by the {%pāśupata%} of Rudra. To counter-
act their evil propensities Rudra created a number of {%Mātṛs%}
who could not bring about the desired effect. Hence Vāsu-
deva created a Śuṣkarevatī who brought about their des-
truction by drinking off their blood.
