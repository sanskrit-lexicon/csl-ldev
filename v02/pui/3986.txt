{%Gajendra%} (I)¦ — the legend of Viṣṇu freeing the ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant in trouble. While wandering in the hills, this lord
<div n="lb"/>of elephants felt thirsty and entered a lake in the Trikūṭa
<div n="lb"/>hill. While drinking water, a crocodile caught hold of its
<div n="lb"/>feet. Finding himself on the brink of death, Gajendra
<div n="lb"/>bestowed his thought on Hari on account of the {%vāsana%} of
<div n="lb"/>the previous birth. Pleased with his prayer, Hari flew on
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa with his cakra and released the animal from the
<div n="lb"/>crocodile. The elephant attained a form like that of Hari.
<div n="lb"/>This elephant was in his previous birth a Pāṇḍyan king by
<div n="lb"/>name Indradyumna devoted to Hari but cursed by Agastya
<div n="lb"/>to be born as elephant.<sup>1</sup> Hari blessed Gajendra who got
<div n="lb"/>mokṣa by {%satsanga.%}<sup>2</sup> Hence Gajendramokṣa.<sup>3</sup>
