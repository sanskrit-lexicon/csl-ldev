{%Gajendra%} (I)¦ — the legend of Viṣṇu freeing the ele-
phant in trouble. While wandering in the hills, this lord
of elephants felt thirsty and entered a lake in the Trikūṭa
hill. While drinking water, a crocodile caught hold of its
feet. Finding himself on the brink of death, Gajendra
bestowed his thought on Hari on account of the {%vāsana%} of
the previous birth. Pleased with his prayer, Hari flew on
Garuḍa with his cakra and released the animal from the
crocodile. The elephant attained a form like that of Hari.
This elephant was in his previous birth a Pāṇḍyan king by
name Indradyumna devoted to Hari but cursed by Agastya
to be born as elephant.<sup>1</sup> Hari blessed Gajendra who got
mokṣa by {%satsanga.%}<sup>2</sup> Hence Gajendramokṣa.<sup>3</sup>
