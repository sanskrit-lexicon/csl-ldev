{%Bhṛgu%} (I)¦ — born from fire; one of the ten mind-born
<div n="lb"/>sons of Brahmā; born of his skin; married Kardama's daugh-

<div n="lb"/>daughter of Puloma and brought forth twelve sons besides
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana and Ānuvan; married two daughters of Dakṣa; a
<div n="lb"/>sage of the Cākṣuṣa epoch;<sup>1</sup> a Mahaṛṣi; a Mantrakṛt; a Pra-

<div n="lb"/>Vedas from Manu.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Deputed by the sages to find out the greatest of the
<div n="lb"/>Gods, went to his father's court without invoking him in
<div n="lb"/>praise; Brahmā grew angry but restrained his anger. Then
<div n="lb"/>he went to Śiva, who embraced him. Bhṛgu told him that
<div n="lb"/>he did not like his behaviour when Śiva grew angry and
<div n="lb"/>started to attack him with his trident. He was stopped by
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī's intervention. Next he called on Hari and kicked
<div n="lb"/>him while sleeping, on His chest. Hari coolly bore it, bowed
<div n="lb"/>to him and said that only then he became purified and
<div n="lb"/>united with Lakṣmī. Bhṛgu wondered at his patience and
<div n="lb"/>concluded that he was the greatest of all the gods.<sup>4</sup> Wonder-
