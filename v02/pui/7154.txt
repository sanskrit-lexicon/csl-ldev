{%Nimi%} (I)¦ — one of the elder sons of Ikṣvāku; solicited
<div n="lb"/>the service of Vasiṣṭha for performing a sacrifice; Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>asked Nimi to wait until he returned from Indra's sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>to which he had been invited earlier. But Nimi thinking
<div n="lb"/>of the mutability of things got it done with the help of other
<div n="lb"/>sages; finding that Nimi had finished his sacrifice the sage
<div n="lb"/>cursed ‘Let his body fall’. The king cursed the sage in
<div n="lb"/>his turn and cast off his body. After preserving the body
<div n="lb"/>in a balm for seven days the sages requested the gods to
<div n="lb"/>restore him to life; Nimi refused to enter again the bondage
<div n="lb"/>of the physical body; then the gods said, ‘let him live in the
<div n="lb"/>eyelids of all living beings’. But the sages were afraid of
<div n="lb"/>anarchy and churned the body of Nimi for a son and this
<div n="lb"/>was Janaka Vaideha;<sup>1</sup> performed a {%satra%} at which the nine
