{%Trayodeva%}¦ — by the agitation of the guṇas or qualities
three gods with body came into being; the Rajas is Brahmā,
Tamas Agni and Satva, Viṣṇu; the first had the duty of
creation, the second Kāla and the third Udāsīna; these are
three worlds, three Vedas and three fires, one dependent on
the other; by their joint action the world progresses;
(Advaita): three functions of Prajāpati as creator, destroyer
and protector.
