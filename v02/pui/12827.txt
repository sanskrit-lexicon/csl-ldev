{%Vidura%}¦ — a Kṣetraja son of Vicitravīrya (through the
<div n="lb"/>female servants of the queens of Vicitravīrya-{%Vi. P.%}); a son
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana (Vyāsa) and a brother of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira narrated the services done by Vidura to
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas from the beginning and asked about
<div n="lb"/>the welfare of Kṛṣṇa and others when Vidura spent some-
<div n="lb"/>time at Hāstinapura. Persuaded Dhṛtarāṣṭra to leave the
<div n="lb"/>capital secretly to the Himālayas for penance, Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>following him.<sup>1</sup> Insulted by Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Śakuni
<div n="lb"/>and ordered to be banished. Left Hāstinapura and wander-
<div n="lb"/>ed through the holy places and reaching Prabhāsā, heard of
<div n="lb"/>the establishment of rule by Yudhiṣṭhira. Hearing of the
<div n="lb"/>death of his kinsmen he went back to the Sarasvatī and
<div n="lb"/>performed ablutions at eleven different places sacred to Trita,
<div n="lb"/>Uśanas, etc. Passing through the flourishing Surāṣṭra,
<div n="lb"/>Sauvīra and other countries, he reached the Yamunā and met
<div n="lb"/>Uddhava. Asked him about the welfare of his kinsmen in-
<div n="lb"/>cluding Ugrasena and sons of Kṛṣṇa. Entertained by him
<div n="lb"/>and having heard of the last days of Kṛṣṇa and the Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>and of the fact that Maitreya had been ordered by Kṛṣṇa to
<div n="lb"/>be his preceptor, Vidura left Yamunā for the Ganges where
<div n="lb"/>he met Maitreya.<sup>2</sup> Being addressed, Maitreya said that
<div n="lb"/>Vidura was god Yama incarnate, and gave him a brief
<div n="lb"/>description of the creations and of the knowledge of one god,
<div n="lb"/>and that Hari was the goal. Listened to the story of Uttāna-
<div n="lb"/>pāda and his line, and the discourse on Ātman.<sup>3</sup> Left for
<div n="lb"/>Hāstinapura; having abandoned his relatives came back to
[Page3-228+ 32]
<div n="P"/>them. Welcomed by Yudhiṣṭhira and others. Invited for
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira's Rājasūya in which he took an active part, and
<div n="lb"/>approved of the anointment of Yudhiṣṭhira. Went to Syaman-
<div n="lb"/>tapañcaka for the solar eclipse, and left it after it was over.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Seen by Akrūra, met by Kṛtavarman, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>After the death of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and his wife, Vidura went on
<div n="lb"/>a pilgrimage and cast off his body at Prabhāsā. Had realised
<div n="lb"/>the Yoga power of Hari.<sup>6</sup>
