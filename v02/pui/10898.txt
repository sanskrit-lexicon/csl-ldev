{%Musala%} (II)¦ — a weapon of Śeṣa;<sup>1</sup> to exterminate all the
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas by the curse of sages; came out of Sāmba's womb
<div n="lb"/>which was powdered and thrown into the sea; a piece was
<div n="lb"/>devoured by a fish, and a hunter who got it, shot it against
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa sitting, little knowing that he was the Lord; it was
<div n="lb"/>the cause of the Lord departing to heaven; other pieces
<div n="lb"/>became kuśa grass which became in the hands of the
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas iron sticks with which they struck one another and
<div n="lb"/>died.<sup>2</sup>
