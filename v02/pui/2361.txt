{%Kaca%}¦ — the son of Bṛhaspati; deputed by gods to learn
{%Samjīvinī vidyā%} from Śukrācārya; offered himself as a
disciple and admitted as a pupil by Śukra; conducted himself
to the satisfaction of his teacher and his daughter Devayānī
for a period of 500 years. Once while out in the woods
tending Śukra's cows, the Asuras killed him and left his
body to be devoured by dogs and jackals. The cows
returned home but not Kaca. Devayānī suspected of foul
play and reported his death. Śukra brought him back to
life.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>On another occasion he went to the woods to gather
flowers for Devayānī and this time the Asuras ground him
to pieces and mixing them with {%surā%} offered it to Śukra
who drank it. Again Devayānī persisted wanting him back
to life. This meant Śukra's death for he had to come out
by tearing open his belly. So he taught Kaca the {%Samjīvinī%}
{%vidyā%} so that he might restore him after his revival. Thus
he did and so he learnt the {%vidyā.%} After a sojourn of ten
hundred years he returned with due leave from his teacher.
Now Devayānī offered to marry him but he pointed out that
it was not proper to marry his preceptor's daughter. So
[Page1-299+ 25]
she cursed that he would not get the fruits of his {%vidyā%}
and he retorted that she would not find a Brāhmaṇa husband
but only a Kṣatriya. Returned to the gods who gave him
a share in their oblations; put to death by Vṛṣaparvan's
men.<sup>2</sup>
