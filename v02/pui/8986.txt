<div n="lb"/>Bali; wife Lohinī and son Indradhanvan; had one thousand
<div n="lb"/>arms and was ruling from his capital Śoṇitapura; pleased
<div n="lb"/>Śiva by praise; was a devotee of Śiva; and became the head

<div n="lb"/>Indra; fought with Sūrya and was helped by his 99 brothers;
<div n="lb"/>a friend of Kamsa and Jarāsandha; he welcomed Jarāsan-
<div n="lb"/>dha, and offered to help him and sent his two ministers and
<div n="lb"/>a vast army with Jarāsandha.<sup>2</sup> Once addressed Śiva that he
<div n="lb"/>found no use for his thousand arms for there was none to
<div n="lb"/>fight him, and even the elephants at the quarters ran away
<div n="lb"/>in fear of him; Śiva replied that soon there would be some-
<div n="lb"/>body equal to him who would put down his pride of power.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The marriage of his daughter Uṣā was the cause of a
<div n="lb"/>battle between Śiva and Kṛṣṇa; the guards of the harem once
<div n="lb"/>reported to Bāṇa that they suspected the presence of some
