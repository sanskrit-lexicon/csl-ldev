{%Yayāti%}¦ — the middle son of Nahuṣa and Virajā, the mind-
born daughter of Ajyapas: married Śarmiṣṭhā, daughter of
Vṛṣaparvan,<sup>1</sup> and had three sons by her; pleased with him
Indra gave him a golden chariot yoked with swift horses
and which became the ratha of the Paurava kings.<sup>2</sup> Became
king after his father: desire for more territory; placed his
[Page3-018+ 44]
younger brothers in charge of the four quarters of the king-
dom; nature of his good rule described; in the course of a
hunting expedition, he heard the cry of a girl coming out
of a well and going near it found a girl inside standing help-
less and naked; he gave her his upper cloth to wear and
lifted her up. She was Devayānī, the daughter of Śukra
and she became his wife and bore him two sons, Yadu and
Turvasu. Śukra in offering his daughter to the king asked
him not to share his bed with Śarmiṣṭhā. In a weak
moment, forgetting his promise, he yielded to the entreaties
of Śarmiṣṭhā and on this Devayānī departed to Śukra's
place. Yayāti followed her and was cursed by Śukra to
become old; but Śukra said that he could take the youth
of somebody by exchanging it for his old age. He enquired
of all his sons and all except Pūru refused to comply with
his request. With Pūru's youth he enjoyed for long the
company of Devayānī; narrated to her an old story of an
ewe found in a well, loving a ram, who was not faithful at
first but who spent ultimately a long time of enjoyment with
her. He compared himself to that ram and said that he
should thereafter bestow his thought on Hari. So he
returned his youth to Pūru and led a life of penance at
Bhṛgutunga after anointing Pūru on the throne and appoint-
ing his other sons in different parts of the kingdom; dis-
courses of, to Pūru on gentleness and friendliness to all;
was devoted to Hari. Parīkṣit compared to Yayāti for his
{%dharma.%}<sup>3</sup> Cursed that Yadu and his line be debarred from
succeeding to the throne, though five dynasties of his sons
are distinguished like the sun's rays.<sup>4</sup> Tenth in genera-
tion from Prajāpati.<sup>5</sup> Went to heaven but Indra sent him
back; one version is that he stands in the {%antarikṣa%} and the
other is that he went back to heaven; met Indra and narrated
Pūru's coronation: Indra told him of the completion of his
righteousness and hence birth on the earth.<sup>6</sup> Falling down,
met Aṣṭaka and the other grandsons, who cleared him of
his doubts regarding the course of fate and man's helpless-
ress, the fruits of karma, the worlds enjoyed by him, the
[Page3-019+ 26]
bhauma naraka, the means to get samjñā, and the duties of
four āśramas and munis.<sup>7</sup> These with Pratardana, Vasuman
and Śibi offered a part of their puṇyam to make Yayāti enjoy
heaven. Śibi leading Yayāti to heaven in a golden chariot
as a result of their good deeds and truthfulness.<sup>8</sup>
