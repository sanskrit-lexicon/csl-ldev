{%Janaka%} (I)¦ — (king of Mithīlā) one of the twelve sages
who knew the nature of the {%dharma%} ordained by Hari. Son
of Nimi, born by churning his dead body and hence known
Mithila. He was Vaideha, born of a {%videha.%} He founded the
city of Mithilā. His son was Udāvasu. Father of Sītā.<sup>1</sup> In
his sacrifice Yājñavalkya won a prize for learning while
Śākalya was humbled for pretended superiority. Father-in-
law of Rāma.<sup>2</sup> In the Aśvamedha Yajña of his, Sākalya was
[Page1-623+ 35]
ruined on account of his conceit by taking part in a disputa-
tion; Janaka wanted to know the best among the learned
assembled and set apart 11,000 crores, much gold, villages
and servants to be given as present to him; in the disputa-
tion each took part but Yājñavalkya ultimately threw out
the challenge. Sākalya questioned this and put to him a
number of questions which were all answered. Yājñavalkya
in his turn put him a single question, a wrong reply to it
inviting instantaneous death; Sākalya agreed, and unable to
answer his question, was gathered to his ancestors;<sup>3</sup> told by
the sage Asita what the Earth narrated to him about the
ignorance of kings who without subduing themselves, try to
subdue others.<sup>4</sup>
