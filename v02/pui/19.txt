{%Akrūra%} (I)¦ — a Yadu prince; welcomed Kṛṣṇa to Dvā-
<div n="lb"/>raka.<sup>1</sup> The foremost of the sons of Śvaphalka and Gāndinī;
<div n="lb"/>married a daughter of Ugrasena and had two sons, Devavān
<div n="lb"/>and Upadeva (Deva and Anupadeva-{%Vi%}).<sup>2</sup> Stayed in Madhu-
<div n="lb"/>rā (Mathurā) when the Yadus migrated.<sup>3</sup> Once visited Brah-
<div n="lb"/>maḥrada.<sup>4</sup> Kaṃsa sent for him and asked him to take in
<div n="lb"/>his chariot Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to the capital for the Dhanur-
<div n="lb"/>yāga (‘festival of arms’) at which they were to be killed.
<div n="lb"/>Returned home with this message.<sup>5</sup> When the night passed
<div n="lb"/>by, Akrūra started for the {%vraja%} of Nanda thinking all the way
<div n="lb"/>of the meeting and embraces of Kṛṣṇa and Rāma who had
<div n="lb"/>made friends with people of Brindāvan. Reached Gokula
<div n="lb"/>by evening.<sup>6</sup> Saw Rāma and Kṛṣṇa in fine deportment and
<div n="lb"/>form, milking cows: prostrated before them in divine ecstasy.
<div n="lb"/>Welcomed in the proper way by the brothers and Nanda,
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra was lost in wonder, and did not feel the fatigue of the
<div n="lb"/>journey.<sup>7</sup> Gopis who came to know of Akrūra's mission called
<div n="lb"/>him Krūra for taking away Kṛṣṇa from their midst.<sup>8</sup> It was
<div n="lb"/>early morning when Akrūra and the two brothers started
<div n="lb"/>after morning prayers. Reaching the Yamunā, Akrūra went
<div n="lb"/>to the river for a bath, asking the brothers to stay in the cha-
<div n="lb"/>riot. But he was surprised to see the brothers in the waters,
<div n="lb"/>and at the same time in the chariot also. He also saw Hari
<div n="lb"/>reclining on Śeṣa.<sup>9</sup> Akrūra's praise of Hari.<sup>10</sup> Con-
<div n="lb"/>gratulating himself on his luck to have had a {%darśan%} of Hari,
<div n="lb"/>he drove Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to Mathurā before sunset.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Invited Kṛṣṇa to his home, and the latter agreed to go to
<div n="lb"/>his place only after Kaṃsavadha. Informed Kaṃsa of
[Page1-004+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's arrival in the camp, and went back to his house.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Attended the wrestling match.<sup>12(a</sup> Gopis took Uddhava to
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra.<sup>13</sup> Was visited by Kṛṣṇa with Rāma and Uddhava to
<div n="lb"/>whom Akrūra gave a royal welcome.<sup>14</sup> Kṛṣṇa told Akrūra
<div n="lb"/>that they looked to him for guidance, and that he was their
<div n="lb"/>{%guru.%} Was requested by Kṛṣṇa to go to Hastināpura to find
<div n="lb"/>out the exact position of the Pāṇḍavas.<sup>15</sup> Visited Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>and returned to Mathurā after meeting Kunti and ascertain-
<div n="lb"/>ing the evil intentions of Dhṛtarāṣṭṛa against the Pāṇḍavas.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="lb"/>One of those stationed by Kṛṣṇa to defend the western gate
<div n="lb"/>of Mathurā,<sup>17</sup> was consulted by Kṛṣṇa on the eve of his attack
<div n="lb"/>on Jarāsandha.<sup>18</sup> A member of the Yādava sabhā.<sup>19</sup> Satya-
<div n="lb"/>bhāmā refusing to part with the jewel Syamantaka (s.v.),
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra suggested with Kṛtavarman to Śatadhanvan Bhoja
<div n="lb"/>its seizure from Satrājita as he had failed to keep his promise
<div n="lb"/>to marry his daughter to them.<sup>20</sup> Asked by Śatadhanvan for
<div n="lb"/>help against Kṛṣṇa, Akrūra refused; Bhoja Śatadhanvan
<div n="lb"/>killed Satrājita, the father of Satyabhāmā, and secured
<div n="lb"/>the jewel but placed it in Akrūra's custody.<sup>21</sup> Became
<div n="lb"/>afraid, after Śatadhanva's death at the hands of Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Balarāma, and left Dvārakā. Evil portents in the city and
<div n="lb"/>cessation of rains. It was said that rain fell where Akrūra
<div n="lb"/>lived. Was sent for by Kṛṣṇa to return to Dvārakā; gave
<div n="lb"/>his sister in marriage to Kṛṣṇa who after duly honouring
<div n="lb"/>him, requested him to show the jewel in public, so that
<div n="lb"/>Rāma might not misunderstand him. He did so in the
<div n="lb"/>sabhā of the Sātvatas but Kṛṣṇa placed Syamantaka back
<div n="lb"/>in his hand.<sup>22</sup> Was sent back to Dvārakā after the Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>sūya for its defence.<sup>23</sup> Visited Syamantapañcaka on the
<div n="lb"/>occasion of the solar eclipse.<sup>24</sup> Fought with Bhoja, deluded
<div n="lb"/>by Kṛṣṇa.<sup>25</sup> Got killed in the Yādava contest at Prabhāsa.<sup>26</sup>
