{%Nābhāga%} (III)¦ — the last son of Nabhaga and a bachelor;
<div n="lb"/>saw his father's property divided among his other brothers
<div n="lb"/>and himself left with nothing; on his father's advice he went
<div n="lb"/>to the sacrifice of Angīra's descendants and explained the
<div n="lb"/>sixth day rituals relating to Viśvedevas. When the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficers went to Heaven their unspent wealth was presented
<div n="lb"/>to him. At this time appeared a person of dark complexion
<div n="lb"/>who was Rudra and who claimed all the property as his
<div n="lb"/>own; when Nabhaga was consulted he said that on a certain
<div n="lb"/>occasion, all the remainder in a sacrificial hall was left to
<div n="lb"/>Rudra. So Nābhāga apologised and gave away all that
[Page2-224+ 31]
<div n="lb"/>wealth. With this Rudra was pleased and initiated him
<div n="lb"/>into the knowledge of the Brahman. After making a
<div n="lb"/>present of all that wealth to the prince, he disappeared.
