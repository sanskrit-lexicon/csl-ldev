{%Nābhāga%} (III)¦ — the last son of Nabhaga and a bachelor;
saw his father's property divided among his other brothers
and himself left with nothing; on his father's advice he went
to the sacrifice of Angīra's descendants and explained the
sixth day rituals relating to Viśvedevas. When the sacri-
ficers went to Heaven their unspent wealth was presented
to him. At this time appeared a person of dark complexion
who was Rudra and who claimed all the property as his
own; when Nabhaga was consulted he said that on a certain
occasion, all the remainder in a sacrificial hall was left to
Rudra. So Nābhāga apologised and gave away all that
[Page2-224+ 31]
wealth. With this Rudra was pleased and initiated him
into the knowledge of the Brahman. After making a
present of all that wealth to the prince, he disappeared.
