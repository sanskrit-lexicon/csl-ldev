<div n="lb"/>Bali wanted to know what his desire was. He asked for
<div n="lb"/>three feet of ground, and commended him as a worthy
<div n="lb"/>descendant of Prahlāda. Notwithstanding Śukra dissuading
<div n="lb"/>him, Bali made the desired gift when Vāmana assumed the
<div n="lb"/>Viśvarūpa form, and measured the earth with one foot and
<div n="lb"/>the {%svarga%} with the other. The Gods washed the uplifted
<div n="lb"/>foot of Hari and celebrated a great festivity. This brought
<div n="lb"/>joy to Jāmbavān. The Asuras began to attack but were
<div n="lb"/>roughly handled by Hari's attendants. Finding Bali unable
<div n="lb"/>to keep his word, Vāmana said that he should go to hell;<sup>3</sup>
