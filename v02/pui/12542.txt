Bali wanted to know what his desire was. He asked for
three feet of ground, and commended him as a worthy
descendant of Prahlāda. Notwithstanding Śukra dissuading
him, Bali made the desired gift when Vāmana assumed the
Viśvarūpa form, and measured the earth with one foot and
the {%svarga%} with the other. The Gods washed the uplifted
foot of Hari and celebrated a great festivity. This brought
joy to Jāmbavān. The Asuras began to attack but were
roughly handled by Hari's attendants. Finding Bali unable
to keep his word, Vāmana said that he should go to hell;<sup>3</sup>

blessed Bali and assured Prahlāda of future bliss: asked
Śuka to complete the sacrifice started by Bali and bestowed
the kingdom on his brother Indra: anointed Lord of all the
worlds and became known as Upendra. Taken to Heaven
in a celestial car when the universe was given to Indra;<sup>4</sup>
