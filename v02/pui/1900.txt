{%Umāvanam%}¦ — in Kailāsa where Śaṅkara assumed
{%Ardhanārīśvara form.%}<sup>1</sup> Once Umā requested her lord that
whoever might enter her hermitage should be converted to
womanhood and that Śiva himself must become a woman
in form; hence all the creatures in the great forest became
women. Once Sudyumna came on a hunting tour to the
place and became a woman.<sup>2</sup>
