{%Umāvanam%}¦ — in Kailāsa where Śaṅkara assumed
<div n="lb"/>{%Ardhanārīśvara form.%}<sup>1</sup> Once Umā requested her lord that
<div n="lb"/>whoever might enter her hermitage should be converted to
<div n="lb"/>womanhood and that Śiva himself must become a woman
<div n="lb"/>in form; hence all the creatures in the great forest became
<div n="lb"/>women. Once Sudyumna came on a hunting tour to the
<div n="lb"/>place and became a woman.<sup>2</sup>
