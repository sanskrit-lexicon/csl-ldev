{%Harikeśa%} (III)¦ — a son of Pūrṇabhadra, the Yakṣa; he
<div n="lb"/>became a devotee of Śiva and gave up the svadharma of the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas. Hence the angry father banished him. He perform-
[Page3-749+ 27]
<div n="lb"/>ed austerities so severely at Benares for thousands of years
<div n="lb"/>that he was covered over with mud and eaten by ants till he
<div n="lb"/>was reduced to bones. Śiva came to the spot with Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>and made him Dhanada, the Ganeśvara and Kṣetrapāla; he
<div n="lb"/>was also made Annada. Two Gaṇas Udbhrama and
<div n="lb"/>Sambhrama were given for his service. Then Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī disappeared.
