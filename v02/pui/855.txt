<div n="lb"/>Father of Abhimanyu by Subhadrā.<sup>1</sup> Promised Draupadī
<div n="lb"/>to cut off Aśvathāma's head and place it before her for his
<div n="lb"/>killing her sons when asleep. Aśvathāma heard this and
<div n="lb"/>ran for escape. Arjuna pursued him. Unwilling to slay
<div n="lb"/>the son of his preceptor, he bound him with ropes and took
<div n="lb"/>him to his queen's presence. She requested Arjuna to
<div n="lb"/>release him on the ground that he was a Brāhmaṇa, a son
<div n="lb"/>of the guru, and for the sake of his old mother Gautamī.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma was not for the release. But Arjuna took the hint
<div n="lb"/>from Kṛṣṇa, and after depriving him of his crest-jewel,
<div n="lb"/>banished him.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Accompanied Yudhiṣṭhira to see Bhīṣma on the eve of
<div n="lb"/>his death.<sup>3</sup> A playmate of Kṛṣṇa.<sup>4</sup> Had a chariot with
<div n="lb"/>monkey standard. When he was once in the forest with
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, they met Kālindī, daughter of the Sun god anxious
<div n="lb"/>to marry Kṛṣṇa. When Arjuna burnt Khāṇḍava, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was his charioteer. Drove away the princes who attacked
[Page1-108+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa returning with Satyā of Kośala.<sup>5</sup> Commended by
<div n="lb"/>Indra to Kṛṣṇa's protection.<sup>6</sup> Consoled by Kṛṣṇa when
<div n="lb"/>banished to the forest.<sup>7</sup> A great name among the Kurus.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Joy at Kṛṣṇa's visit to Indraprastha. By burning the forest
<div n="lb"/>he released Maya and enjoyed Kṛṣṇa's company. Went to
<div n="lb"/>the eastern countries. Went again with Kṛṣṇa and Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>disguised as a Brāhmaṇa to Girivraja. Revealed himself
<div n="lb"/>before Jarāsandha who thought that he was not his equal.
<div n="lb"/>Returned after Jarāsandha's fall.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Entertained elders at the Rājasūya of Yudhisthira. On
<div n="lb"/>seeing the enemy's army in the battle-field, his teachers, kith
<div n="lb"/>and kin among them, he expressed to Kṛṣṇa his reluctance
<div n="lb"/>to fight them. Kṛṣṇa taught him the truth {%(Gītā),%} showed
<div n="lb"/>him his {%Viśvarūpa%} and roused him to action. He fought,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa serving as charioteer.<sup>10</sup> Victory due to Kṛṣṇa.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard of Abhimanyu's death and vowed to kill Jaya-
<div n="lb"/>dratha the following day, which he did.<sup>12</sup> Was taken by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa to Kailāsa where Śiva blessed him. Took part in
<div n="lb"/>the {%svayamvaram%} of Lakṣmaṇā. His arrow touched the
<div n="lb"/>fish target but did not hit it.<sup>13</sup> In the course of his pilgri-
<div n="lb"/>mage he heard at Prabhāsa that his uncle's daughter Subha-
<div n="lb"/>drā was being proposed by Balarāma to Duryodhana. He
<div n="lb"/>wished to marry her, and with this object spent four months
<div n="lb"/>in Dvāraka as {%Tridaṇḍī%} ascetic. At this time Rāma invited
<div n="lb"/>him one day for {%bhikṣā.%} When he and Subhadrā met, both
<div n="lb"/>exchanged their love by their eyes. On a day of festive
<div n="lb"/>occasion Subhadrā came out, when Arjuna carried her off
<div n="lb"/>in a chariot with the approval of Kṛṣṇa. Rāma protested
<div n="lb"/>but Kṛṣṇa pacified him. Finally Rāma sent presents to his
<div n="lb"/>sister.<sup>14</sup> On a visit to Syamantapañcaka.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>Once a Brāhmaṇa of Dvāraka preferred a complaint
<div n="lb"/>during Kṛṣṇa's {%aśvamedha%} that his children died imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately after their birth. Arjuna offered to recover them
[Page1-109+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>for him, though Kṛṣṇa had his own doubt. Accompanying
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa, Arjuna guarded the delivery room. The
<div n="lb"/>child was born and soon died. At this Arjuna went to
<div n="lb"/>Indra's place, and Yama's, and to the abodes of all gods,
<div n="lb"/>with the resolution to fall in a fire in case he did not rescue
<div n="lb"/>the child. Unable to recover it, Arjuna was about to
<div n="lb"/>plunge into the flames when Kṛṣṇa prevented him. He was
<div n="lb"/>taken to the abode of Nārāyaṇa and all the children were
<div n="lb"/>recovered. Returned to Dvārakā to attend Kṛṣṇa's {%aśvame-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%dha,%} after bringing joy to the Brāhmaṇa.<sup>16</sup> Other exploits

<div n="lb"/>handed 60,000 {%dānavas%} who obstructed {%yajñas.%}<sup>18</sup> Went to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā to see his relations. Was advised to take Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>to Indraprastha as Dvārakā was about to be swallowed by
<div n="lb"/>the sea. Performed the last rites to the dead in Dvārakā,
<div n="lb"/>and took the remainder to his place. Was defeated by rob-
<div n="lb"/>bers and Ābhiras after the departure of Kṛṣṇa to Heaven.
