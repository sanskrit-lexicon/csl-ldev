{%Arjuna%} (III)¦ — a Pāṇḍava, son of Indra and Kuntī and
father of Śrutakīrti. Had a son Irāvān by Ulūpi and
another son Babruvāhana by the daughter of Maṇipurapati.
Father of Abhimanyu by Subhadrā.<sup>1</sup> Promised Draupadī
to cut off Aśvathāma's head and place it before her for his
killing her sons when asleep. Aśvathāma heard this and
ran for escape. Arjuna pursued him. Unwilling to slay
the son of his preceptor, he bound him with ropes and took
him to his queen's presence. She requested Arjuna to
release him on the ground that he was a Brāhmaṇa, a son
of the guru, and for the sake of his old mother Gautamī.
Bhīma was not for the release. But Arjuna took the hint
from Kṛṣṇa, and after depriving him of his crest-jewel,
banished him.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Accompanied Yudhiṣṭhira to see Bhīṣma on the eve of
his death.<sup>3</sup> A playmate of Kṛṣṇa.<sup>4</sup> Had a chariot with
monkey standard. When he was once in the forest with
Kṛṣṇa, they met Kālindī, daughter of the Sun god anxious
to marry Kṛṣṇa. When Arjuna burnt Khāṇḍava, Kṛṣṇa
was his charioteer. Drove away the princes who attacked
[Page1-108+ 46]

Indra to Kṛṣṇa's protection.<sup>6</sup> Consoled by Kṛṣṇa when
banished to the forest.<sup>7</sup> A great name among the Kurus.<sup>8</sup>
Joy at Kṛṣṇa's visit to Indraprastha. By burning the forest
he released Maya and enjoyed Kṛṣṇa's company. Went to
the eastern countries. Went again with Kṛṣṇa and Bhīma
disguised as a Brāhmaṇa to Girivraja. Revealed himself
before Jarāsandha who thought that he was not his equal.
Returned after Jarāsandha's fall.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Entertained elders at the Rājasūya of Yudhisthira. On
seeing the enemy's army in the battle-field, his teachers, kith
and kin among them, he expressed to Kṛṣṇa his reluctance
to fight them. Kṛṣṇa taught him the truth {%(Gītā),%} showed
him his {%Viśvarūpa%} and roused him to action. He fought,
Kṛṣṇa serving as charioteer.<sup>10</sup> Victory due to Kṛṣṇa.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard of Abhimanyu's death and vowed to kill Jaya-
dratha the following day, which he did.<sup>12</sup> Was taken by
Kṛṣṇa to Kailāsa where Śiva blessed him. Took part in
the {%svayamvaram%} of Lakṣmaṇā. His arrow touched the
fish target but did not hit it.<sup>13</sup> In the course of his pilgri-
mage he heard at Prabhāsa that his uncle's daughter Subha-
drā was being proposed by Balarāma to Duryodhana. He
wished to marry her, and with this object spent four months
in Dvāraka as {%Tridaṇḍī%} ascetic. At this time Rāma invited
him one day for {%bhikṣā.%} When he and Subhadrā met, both
exchanged their love by their eyes. On a day of festive
occasion Subhadrā came out, when Arjuna carried her off
in a chariot with the approval of Kṛṣṇa. Rāma protested
but Kṛṣṇa pacified him. Finally Rāma sent presents to his
sister.<sup>14</sup> On a visit to Syamantapañcaka.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>Once a Brāhmaṇa of Dvāraka preferred a complaint
during Kṛṣṇa's {%aśvamedha%} that his children died imme-
diately after their birth. Arjuna offered to recover them
[Page1-109+ 45]
for him, though Kṛṣṇa had his own doubt. Accompanying
the Brāhmaṇa, Arjuna guarded the delivery room. The
child was born and soon died. At this Arjuna went to
Indra's place, and Yama's, and to the abodes of all gods,
with the resolution to fall in a fire in case he did not rescue
the child. Unable to recover it, Arjuna was about to
plunge into the flames when Kṛṣṇa prevented him. He was
taken to the abode of Nārāyaṇa and all the children were
recovered. Returned to Dvārakā to attend Kṛṣṇa's {%aśvame-%}
{%dha,%} after bringing joy to the Brāhmaṇa.<sup>16</sup> Other exploits
of Arjuna were defeating Indra at Khāṇḍava, pleasing Śiva
in Kirāta's disguise, and vanquishing Nivātakavacas.<sup>17</sup>
Went once to Heaven to please Indra, when he slew single-
handed 60,000 {%dānavas%} who obstructed {%yajñas.%}<sup>18</sup> Went to
Dvārakā to see his relations. Was advised to take Yādavas
to Indraprastha as Dvārakā was about to be swallowed by
the sea. Performed the last rites to the dead in Dvārakā,
and took the remainder to his place. Was defeated by rob-
bers and Ābhiras after the departure of Kṛṣṇa to Heaven.
Informed Yudhiṣṭhira of Kṛṣṇa's departure to Heaven and
of his great sorrow, and also of the almost end of the Yādava
stock. Crowned Vajra king.<sup>19</sup> Arjuna knew and realised
the {%māyā%} of {%Hari.%}<sup>20</sup> Observed the {%Ādityaśayanam%} vow.
Visited the Vāmana temple at Kurukṣetra during his {%tīrtha-%}
{%yātrā%} and asked Śaunaka to narrate the circumstances of
that {%Avatār%} after Vārāha.<sup>21</sup> Was asked by Vyāsa to per-
form penance expelling death.<sup>22</sup> Put down the prowess
of Kārtavīrya by the curse of Āpava.<sup>23</sup> Known as Pārtha,
