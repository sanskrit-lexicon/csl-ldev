{%Brahmadatta%} (III)¦ — the son of Vibhrāja, the Pāñcāla
<div n="lb"/>king; in previous birth Pitṛvarti (s.v.), a son of Kauśika;
<div n="lb"/>his queen Sannati, daughter of Devala, being in one of her
<div n="lb"/>previous births the cow of Garga, was killed by Kauśika's
<div n="lb"/>sons during a famine; was anointed the Pāñcāla king, and
<div n="lb"/>his two brothers in his previous birth, became his ministers;
[Page2-507+ 29]
<div n="lb"/>both king and queen once visited the pleasure garden and
<div n="lb"/>were taken by surprise at the sight of the love quarrels
<div n="lb"/>between two ants who were husband and wife; the wife
<div n="lb"/>accused the husband of taking pieces of {%modaka%} (sweet-
<div n="lb"/>meat) to a neighbouring lady-love, an ant; the husband
<div n="lb"/>confessed that it was offered so thinking that she was her-
<div n="lb"/>self, his own wife and that he would behave more carefully
<div n="lb"/>in future; B. understood this as he could follow the language
<div n="lb"/>of all insects by divine grace; when Sannati thought that
<div n="lb"/>the king laughed at her and took it seriously, he took a
<div n="lb"/>vow for seven days and at the sight of Sudaridra, the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmana, remembered his past and became a Siddha him-
<div n="lb"/>self having anointed his son Viśvakṣena on the throne.
<div n="P"/>M. 20. 23-38; 21. 16, 24-35.
