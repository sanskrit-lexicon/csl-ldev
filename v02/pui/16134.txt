<div n="lb"/>Ilā converted into a male: (Kimpuruṣa); once when he rode
<div n="lb"/>into a forest on a saindhava horse, he came upon Umā's

<div n="lb"/>formed into females. This was due to a boon granted to
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī by Śiva. In this womanly form Budha saw and
<div n="lb"/>embraced her. Aila Purūravas was born of this union.
<div n="lb"/>Sudyumna wanted to regain his male form and prayed to

<div n="lb"/>to have male form and female form in alternate months.
