{%Sudyumna%} (I)¦ — one of the ten sons of Cākṣuṣa Manu;
Ilā converted into a male: (Kimpuruṣa); once when he rode
into a forest on a saindhava horse, he came upon Umā's
pleasure garden where he with his followers were trans-
formed into females. This was due to a boon granted to
Pārvatī by Śiva. In this womanly form Budha saw and
embraced her. Aila Purūravas was born of this union.
Sudyumna wanted to regain his male form and prayed to
Vasiṣṭha. The latter waited on Śiva who allowed Sudyumna
to have male form and female form in alternate months.
Returning to his kingdom he was not liked by his subjects.
His three sons were in charge of Dakṣiṇāpatha. In the ful-
ness of time Purūravas was placed in charge of Pratiṣṭhāna,
Sudyumna leaving for forest to perform penance; father of
three sons, Utkala, Gaya and Haritāśva (Kiratāśva-{%Vā. P.%});
(Vinata-{%Vi. P.%}); being once a female had no share of the
kingdom; however got Pratiṣṭhāna, through Vasiṣṭha's help;
that was given to Purūravas.
