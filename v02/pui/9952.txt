{%Matsya%} (II)¦ — an {%avatār%} of Viṣṇu;<sup>1</sup> once during a Pra-
laya an Asura, Hayagrīva, carried off the Vedas when Hari
took the form of a fish with one horn and fell into the palm
of the Draviḍa king Satyavrata, performing ablutions; find-
ing that it outgrew the size of his palm he took it to a
pond; it outgrew the size of the pond when it was
taken to a lake; it was also too small to hold
it; hence after many trials it was taken to the
sea; addressed by the king the fish revealed to him
his true form and warned him of the Pralaya coming in a
week and prepared him to get into a boat to be sent by him
and have it tied to its horn; the deluge came and Satyavrata
did as was directed; when they were all floating on the sea,
Matsya Hari narrated to him the {%Matsya Purāṇa;%} after the
deluge Matsya killed the demon, Hayagrīva and recovered
the Vedas; through his blessings Satyavrata became Vai-
vasvata Manu;<sup>2</sup> appeared to Vaivasvata Manu during
deluge; protected Manu and others;<sup>3</sup> the form of Viṣṇu wor-
shipped in Ramyaka.<sup>4</sup>
