{%Matsya%} (II)¦ — an {%avatār%} of Viṣṇu;<sup>1</sup> once during a Pra-
<div n="lb"/>laya an Asura, Hayagrīva, carried off the Vedas when Hari
<div n="lb"/>took the form of a fish with one horn and fell into the palm
<div n="lb"/>of the Draviḍa king Satyavrata, performing ablutions; find-
<div n="lb"/>ing that it outgrew the size of his palm he took it to a
<div n="lb"/>pond; it outgrew the size of the pond when it was
<div n="lb"/>taken to a lake; it was also too small to hold
<div n="lb"/>it; hence after many trials it was taken to the
<div n="lb"/>sea; addressed by the king the fish revealed to him
<div n="lb"/>his true form and warned him of the Pralaya coming in a
<div n="lb"/>week and prepared him to get into a boat to be sent by him
<div n="lb"/>and have it tied to its horn; the deluge came and Satyavrata
<div n="lb"/>did as was directed; when they were all floating on the sea,
<div n="lb"/>Matsya Hari narrated to him the {%Matsya Purāṇa;%} after the
<div n="lb"/>deluge Matsya killed the demon, Hayagrīva and recovered
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas; through his blessings Satyavrata became Vai-
<div n="lb"/>vasvata Manu;<sup>2</sup> appeared to Vaivasvata Manu during
<div n="lb"/>deluge; protected Manu and others;<sup>3</sup> the form of Viṣṇu wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped in Ramyaka.<sup>4</sup>
