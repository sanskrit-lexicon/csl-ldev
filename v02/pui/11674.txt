{%Rukmi%}¦ — first son of the Vidarbha king, Bhīṣmaka;
brother of Rukmiṇī, and enemy of Kṛṣṇa; capital Bhojakaṭa;
wanted to give his sister Rukmiṇī to Caidya, though his
brothers were for Kṛṣṇa.<sup>1</sup> Followed Kṛṣṇa running with his
sister and near the Narmadā fought with him. On an appeal
from Rukmiṇī to spare his life, Rukmi was put to shame
by the removal of his locks of hair and moustache and tied
to his chariot; could not reconcile himself with Kṛṣṇa's action
and resolved to kill Kṛṣṇa and then enter Kuṇḍina.
Released by Balarāma, he built and lived in Bhojakaṭa with-
out going back to Kuṇḍina.<sup>2</sup> Was met by Śālva at Kuṇḍina;
was stationed by Jarāsandha at the western gate of Mathurā
and on the eastern side during the siege of Gomanta.<sup>3</sup> Gave
his daughter to Pradyumna in marriage to please his sister,
but continued to hate Kṛṣṇa; prayed to Śiva who gave him
a bow saying that it would not harm Hari; went back to
[Page3-085+ 38]
Bhojakaṭa, afraid of meeting Kṛṣṇa.<sup>4</sup> Gave his grand-
daughter to Aniruddha in marriage. When he invited
Rāma for a game of dice on the occasion, he played falsely
and insulted Balarāma (s.v.) as a cowherd and forester at
which he was struck dead. Kṛṣṇa passed no comments on
his death out of consideration for his brother and Rukmiṇī.<sup>5</sup>
