{%Kālayavana%}¦ — the son of Yavaneśvara, black in colour
and hard-hearted; after crowning him king, his father
retired to the woods; full of prowess he asked Nārada of
some powerful heroes and being told about Yādavas he
directed himself towards them with a big army of Mlec-
chas; Kṛṣṇa met him unarmed and was pursued; seeing
him entering a cave where Mucukunda was sleeping, Kāla
entered and thinking Mucukunda to be Kṛṣṇa kicked him;
on Mucukunda waking up and looking at Kālanemi he was
[Page1-364+ 24]
burnt to ashes as there was a vow that he who would awake
Mucukunda would meet with such an end.
