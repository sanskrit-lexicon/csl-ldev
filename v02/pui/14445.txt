{%Śiva%} (I)¦ — (also Giritra): several names of the god are
mentioned: master of all Gaṇas and Bhūtas, and a god of
wrath, worshipped for learning;<sup>1</sup> Parīkṣit compared to him
for liberality in granting boons: awarded his own missile to
Arjuna: a great Yogin. Resident of Kailāsa; worships San-
kaṛṣaṇa in Ilāvṛta.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Met by Pracatas and venerated by Kṛṣṇa; knew Vāsu-
deva's glory and the dharma ordained by Hari;<sup>3</sup> pleased with
Bāṇa, guarded his city, and fought with Kṛṣṇa. Insulted by
Dakṣa and Bhṛgu in the sacrifice of Prajāpatis: warned Satī
against attending Dakṣa's sacrifice where he was deprived of
his share. Heard from Nārada of Satī's sacrifice and grew
angry, out sprang Vīrabhadra to ruin the sacrifice; cut off
Dakṣa's head; waited on by Brahmā and consoled, agreed to
attend and praised Viṣṇu, and felt obliged to him.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Appeared before the Pracetasas and initiated them into
the Rudragītā in glory of Hari and left them;<sup>5</sup> praised Aditi
and Vāmana's exploits and was present when he was
anointed Upendra;<sup>6</sup> praised Nṛsimha, and prayed to, by
Prahlāda. His discomfiture at Maya who built three cities for
the safety of the Asuras. Them he killed. But Maya brought
back all of them to life by the immortalised waters which he
discovered in a well. Śiva was worried when Brahmā and
Hari drank the whole of the liquid. Induced by them he
attacked Tripura with success.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>Accompanied Brahmā and other gods when they went
to meet Hari Ajita. Praised by Prajāpatis for consuming
hālāhala that came out of Amṛtamathana. His faces re-
present five Upaniṣads from which thirty-eight {%mantras%}
evolved, Himself being the Highest Truth. The poison got
[Page3-422+ 47]
stuck in his throat and added beauty to his neck. Heard
with wonder the Mohinī form of Hari and came with Pārvatī
to see him. Requested Hari to show himself again as Mohinī.
Seeing the lovely form Śiva became enamoured and ran after
her when his seed dropped in several places which ultimately
became shrines of images of gold and silver. Then he realis-
ed his position and after taking leave of Hari, went to his
abode;<sup>8</sup> embraced Pārvatī sitting on his lap in the midst of
his attendants. This was seen by the Vidyadhara Citraketu
who laughed at it. So he was cursed by Pārvatī to be born
an Asura. When Śiva appealed to her that Citraketu was
Hari's friend, Pārvatī became mild;<sup>9</sup> had a special park in
which he sported with Pārvatī. Waited upon by Vasiṣṭha, he
agreed to let Sudyumna be a male and female in alternate
months;<sup>10</sup> did not comprehend Hari's māyā and advised
Durvāsas pursued by Cakra to go to Hari: prayed to by
Bhagīratha, offered to bear the waters of the Ganges descend-
ing from Heaven after washing the feet of Hari. Joined the
gods in the Tārakāmaya war;<sup>11</sup> worshipped as Paśupati in
Ambikāvana: propitiated with goats in Dhanuryāga, went to
Hari with Brahmā and attended on Him.<sup>12</sup> Easily pleased by
devotees shows grace to them unlike Hari: backed by Śakti
and full of three guṇas — Vaikārika, Taijasa and Tāmasa,
granted Asura Vṛka what he wanted for his tapas by cutting
flesh from his body viz — that he on whose head he placed
his hand should die. He wanted to experiment it on Śiva
himself who took to flight to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="P"/>Hari is nirguṇa and apart from Prakṛti. In the role of
a young Brahmacārin, Hari appeared before Vṛka and said
that owing to curse of Dakṣa his words would not come true.
As a test he could try it on himself. The wicked Asura did
so and died to the relief of Śiva. Śiva welcomed his brother
Bhṛgu but the latter did not appreciate it;<sup>13</sup> worshipped by
Sudakṣiṇa, told him of a means to end the slayer of his father.
Attended Varuṇa's sacrifice and Yudhiṣṭhira's; gave Śālva
an aerial car capable of creating illusion.<sup>14</sup> Arjuna blessed by
[Page3-423+ 59]
Śiva when he called on Him at Kailāsa, during the battle. In
answer to his prayer, Śiva protected the delivery room of the
Dvārakā Brahman;<sup>15</sup> worshipped by Kṛṣṇa who was blessed
with a son Pradyumna: burnt down Kāma who was reborn
as Pradyumna. Pleased with tapas of Rukmi, he gave him a
bow: Rode on his bull against Kṛṣṇa taking Pārijāta from
Indra's abode but Garuḍa vanquished the bull and made
Śiva go back.<sup>16</sup> At Bāṇa's city he produced {%maheśvara%}
{%jvara%} which was averted by Vaiṣṇava {%jvara.%} Seeing Kṛṣṇa
chopping all the arms of Bāṇa except four, Śiva pleaded for
his life to which Kṛṣṇa agreed. On this Śiva approved of the
marriage of Uṣā with Aniruddha. Went with Brahmā to
encourage Devakī;<sup>17</sup> wondered at Mārkaṇḍeya's vrata and
was pleased with his bhakti.<sup>18</sup> Śrīśaila and Gokarṇa are
shrines sacred to Him.<sup>19</sup> (See Nilakaṇṭha for the legend) of
three eyes, riding on bull, holding Pināka bow, equal to
Nandi in strength, attended by Yakṣas, Piśācas, Bhūtas and

ashes, tiger skin for sacred thread;<sup>20</sup> Jyotirliṅga is māheśva-
ram balam, the mahāyogam;<sup>21</sup> cursed by sages of Dāruvana
for enticing their women-folk by his appearing naked, to
become an ass and to lose his liṅgam. Darkness overtook
the world. Brahmā advised sages to worship Śiva in the form
of a Liṅga. The establishment of Liṅga cult, Śiva represents
Agni and Ambikā Moon. Bhasma the vīrya of the Lord;<sup>22</sup> on

the intervention of the seven sages and lived in Oṣadhiprastha
