midst of the ocean and meditated on the teachings of Śiva
given to them; leaving their home they proceeded to the
west and in a park near a great lake heard the divine music;
when listening to it, there appeared Śiva who on request
initiated them in the meditation on Viṣṇu (Rudragītā);
when Śiva left they meditated under the waters for 1000
years. Viṣṇu appeared before them and promised them a
son by asking them to marry the daughter of Kaṇḍu and
Pramlocā; pleased with seeing the God they praised Him;
after his disappearance they came out of the waters and
seeing the earth filled with wild growth they began to burn
the trees by breathing spiritual fire and wind from their
mouth. Brahmā (Soma) interceded then and prevented
them from further destroying the trees by offering Vārkṣi
(Māriṣā) the daughter of the trees in marriage to them;
they married her and she gave birth to Dakṣa on the eve of
the Cākṣuṣa epoch.<sup>1</sup> After a long period of enjoyment of life
they placed their wife under their son Dakṣa and went away
to the western sea where Jajali attained siddhi; seeing them
steadfast in devotion Nārada came there, and was welcom-
ed by them; requested by them to be instructed to get rid of
samsāra, Nārada advised them to worship and contemplate
on Viṣṇu directly, and than departed; they did so and attain-
ed the world of Viṣṇu;<sup>2</sup> sacrifice of, when Nārada sang
praises of Dhruva;<sup>3</sup> worshipped for treasure.<sup>4</sup>
