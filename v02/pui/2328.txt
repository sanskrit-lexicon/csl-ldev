{%Kaṃsa%} (I)¦ — the eldest son of Ugrasena<sup>1</sup> and brother
(cousin-{%Vā. P.%}) of Devakī. Took part in the festivities con-
nected with the marriage of Devakī and Vasudeva, when he
heard a voice from air that her eighth son would kill him.
He at once drew his sword to slay Devakī when Vasudeva
entreated him to spare her life promising to give him all
her sons. To this he agreed. He did not take notice even
of the first boy. Subsequently Nārada confirmed what he
heard from the welkin. So he killed all her sons and put her
and Vasudeva in jail. He waited for the seventh and was
particularly afraid of the eighth. Being informed of the
birth of a girl, and without listening to his sister's appeal
to spare the baby, he dashed it against a stone. It flew
heavenwards and said that the baby born to vanquish him
[Page1-293+ 43]
was safe. Disheartened, Kaṃsa let Vasudeva and Devakī
free. Consulted his ministers who advised him to kill all
infants in the kingdom, and to hurt all Brāhmaṇas and cows,
the root cause of Hari's {%dharma.%} Messengers were sent out
on this mission.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>An incarnation of Kālanemi. Threw his father Ugra-
sena in prison and assumed regal administration.<sup>3</sup>
Encouraged by his Asura friends such as Pralamba and
Baka, as also by the Māgadhan king, he tyrannized the
Yadus who left the land for other countries like Kuru, Pāñ-
cāla and others. The Brāhmaṇas were afraid of him.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard from Nārada that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were
Vasudeva's sons; when he went to slay Vasudeva, Nārada
prevented him from it. He then threw Vasudeva and his
wife in prison. He summoned his councillors and asked the
Mallas, Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika to get ready for a wrestling
match with Kṛṣṇa and Rāma; ordered his mahout to station
the State Elephant at the gate of the enclosure {%(Raṅga)%} and
get Kṛṣṇa and Rāma trampled under its feet; when he was
asked why he was out to kill those two boys, he narrated
the story of his mother once going in the garden thinking
of her husband Ugrasena. Then a Gandharva Drumila per-
sonated Ugrasena. Discovering that he was not her hus-
band, she asked him in wrath who he was. He tried to
console her saying that she would give birth to a heroic son.
The chaste lady retorted that he would be cruel and un-
righteous. Such being his birth, he hated his kith and kin.
Then he commanded to commence the {%Dhanuryāga.%} Akrūra
was sent for and ordered to take his chariot and bring
Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to the {%Dhanuryāga%} with all gopas. He
proposed to kill all of them and rule the kingdoms with the
help of friends like Jarāsandha. Thanked by Akrūra for
an opportunity to visit Kṛṣṇa and Rāma; Akrūra reached
the Vraja and was welcomed by the brothers and Nanda.
Informed of their arrival by Akrūra. Much concerned to
know of the breaking of his bow by Kṛṣṇa and further the
killing of his guards. He had no sleep all night and had
bad dreams, all in fear of Kṛṣṇa. Next morning he drove
[Page1-294+ 36]
to the wrestling ground and occupied the royal seat with
his ministers; was perturbed to learn of the death of Kuva-
layāpīḍa and its guards. Became furious at the death of
his five mallas and the running away of others. Ordered
the banishment of the two brothers, robbing the gopas of
their belongings, and imprisonment of Nanda, killing of
Ugrasena and Vasudeva. Kṛṣṇa attacked him direct, pull-
ed him down from his throne and killed him. His eight
brothers who offered fight were slain by Rāma.<sup>5</sup> Death
welcomed by Gopis and Akrūra.<sup>6</sup> Prevented Vasudeva go-
ing to Karavīrapura. His oppression.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>His queens were Asti and Prāpti, daughters of Jarā-
sandha.<sup>8</sup> His death recalled by Kṛṣṇa to Mucukunda; by
Kṛtavarman to Yudhiṣṭhira; by Kuntī.<sup>9</sup> Attained Hari

by Ugrasena.<sup>11</sup>
