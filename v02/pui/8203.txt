{%Puṣpavāhana%}¦ — a King of Rathantara Kalpa; Brahmā
was pleased at his {%tapas%} and gave him a golden lotus; after
him came the 7th dvīpa, Puṣkaradvīpa (s.v); he got a vehicle
of Puṣpavāhana which took him to any place; his wife was
Lāvaṇyavatī; once he met the sage Prācetas and asked him
the reason for his wealth etc. He said that in the previous
birth he was a hunter and owing to a distressing famine, he
could not get anything to eat; so he plucked some lotus
flowers and went to the Vaidiśa city for selling them; none
offered to buy; soon he heard a musical sound near by;
going in that direction he saw a courtesan engaged in
{%vibhūtidvādaśi vratam;%} there, he gave all flowers needed
for the performance of the vow and did not take gold or
food offered in return; he felt no thirst or hunger; and be-
came changed at that sight; for that service he became
King and the courtesan Prītī, wife of the Lord of love.
