{%Puṣpavāhana%}¦ — a King of Rathantara Kalpa; Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>was pleased at his {%tapas%} and gave him a golden lotus; after
<div n="lb"/>him came the 7th dvīpa, Puṣkaradvīpa (s.v); he got a vehicle
<div n="lb"/>of Puṣpavāhana which took him to any place; his wife was
<div n="lb"/>Lāvaṇyavatī; once he met the sage Prācetas and asked him
<div n="lb"/>the reason for his wealth etc. He said that in the previous
<div n="lb"/>birth he was a hunter and owing to a distressing famine, he
<div n="lb"/>could not get anything to eat; so he plucked some lotus
<div n="lb"/>flowers and went to the Vaidiśa city for selling them; none
<div n="lb"/>offered to buy; soon he heard a musical sound near by;
<div n="lb"/>going in that direction he saw a courtesan engaged in
<div n="lb"/>{%vibhūtidvādaśi vratam;%} there, he gave all flowers needed
<div n="lb"/>for the performance of the vow and did not take gold or
<div n="lb"/>food offered in return; he felt no thirst or hunger; and be-
<div n="lb"/>came changed at that sight; for that service he became
<div n="lb"/>King and the courtesan Prītī, wife of the Lord of love.
<div n="P"/>M. 100. 1-32.
