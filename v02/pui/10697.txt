{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} (I)¦ — a Siddha not lost in deluge;<sup>1</sup> son of
Mṛkaṇḍa;<sup>2</sup> his firm and non-parallelled {%tapas%} and vow of
[Page2-694+ 39]
celibacy; saw the Puruṣa sleeping on a leaf of the {%vaṭavṛksa;%}
his {%āśrama%} near the Himālayas on a Śila-citra; Indra sent
the God of Love, Apsaras and others to disturb him, but in
vain; the mahātmā, seeing Hari in Nara-Nārāyaṇa form
praised him; pleased with him as one who would be
ever meditating on his feet Hari showed him what
a {%Pralaya%} was; Pārvatī and Śiva. saw him, and were
praised; when Śiva offered to grant him anything
he wanted, he expressed his wish to be ever devoted
to him and Hari; pleased with him Śiva went away with
Pārvatī; this worthy son of the Bhṛgu race having earned
Yogic vision and absolutely devoted to Hari even now goes
about the world;<sup>3</sup> an authority on Rāma's story.<sup>4</sup>
