{%Triśaṃku%}¦ — Satyavrata (s.v): the son of Tribandhana
and father of Hariścandra; became a Caṇḍāla by the curse
of his Guru; three spikes meant for him by Vasiṣṭha. Result
of his three sins — displeasing his father, killing the Guru's
cow and eating unconsecrated flesh; banished from the
kingdom; seeing this Viśvāmitra consoled him and agreed
to be his Guru; the latter had him crowned after a purifica-
tion bath in the river, Karmanāśā near the Vindhyas; this
enabled him to go to heaven bodily and get a place among
[Page2-051+ 31]
the planets all in the presence of Vasiṣṭha; though thrust
down headlong from heaven, he was stopped and given a
place in the sky.
