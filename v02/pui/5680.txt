{%Triśaṃku%}¦ — Satyavrata (s.v): the son of Tribandhana
<div n="lb"/>and father of Hariścandra; became a Caṇḍāla by the curse
<div n="lb"/>of his Guru; three spikes meant for him by Vasiṣṭha. Result
<div n="lb"/>of his three sins — displeasing his father, killing the Guru's
<div n="lb"/>cow and eating unconsecrated flesh; banished from the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom; seeing this Viśvāmitra consoled him and agreed
<div n="lb"/>to be his Guru; the latter had him crowned after a purifica-
<div n="lb"/>tion bath in the river, Karmanāśā near the Vindhyas; this
<div n="lb"/>enabled him to go to heaven bodily and get a place among
[Page2-051+ 31]
<div n="lb"/>the planets all in the presence of Vasiṣṭha; though thrust
<div n="lb"/>down headlong from heaven, he was stopped and given a
<div n="lb"/>place in the sky.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. IX. 7. 5-7; Br. III. 63. 108; Vā. 88. 108-13. Vi. IV.
<div n="lb"/>3. 21.
