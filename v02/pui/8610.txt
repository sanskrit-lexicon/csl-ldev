the west flowing Saravatī.<sup>1</sup> Sages of this place visited Dvā-
rakā.<sup>2</sup> During his pilgrimage tour Arjuna went to this;<sup>3</sup>
was visited by Balarāma and revisited by him;<sup>4</sup> here the
Moon God who was struck with consumption (yakṣma) by
the curse of Dakṣa got rid of his disease.<sup>5</sup> Here Sāndipāni's
son was drowned, and Vidura cast off his body.<sup>6</sup> To this came
once the Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas, and Andhakas for sacred ablution
when they had been cursed by some {%munis,%} and gave gifts
of gold, silver and bed to Brahmanas.<sup>7</sup> On Kṛṣṇa's sugges-
tion the Yadus left Dvārakā for good and went to this place,
where they drank heavily induced by Kṛṣṇa, and fighting
with one another, all of them died.<sup>8</sup> Sacred to Puṣkarāvati<sup>9</sup>
