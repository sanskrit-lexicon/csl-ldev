{%Varma Nārāyaṇātmakam%}¦ — a Vaiṣṇavī vidyā, taught by
<div n="lb"/>Viśvarūpa to Indra. Here the various manifestations of Hari
[Page3-162+ 25]
<div n="lb"/>including that of the Buddha are recalled. Once a certain
<div n="lb"/>Kauśikan practised this and gave up his life in a desert. When
<div n="lb"/>a Gandharva crossed the bones of this dead man, he fell
<div n="lb"/>down on the earth. Instructed by Vālakhilyas, he collected
<div n="lb"/>the bones, and after throwing them into the Sarasvatī, and
<div n="lb"/>bathing there, returned to his place. Taught originally to
<div n="lb"/>Tvaṣṭri by Dadhyanga; Tvaṣṭri taught it to Viśvarūpa.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. VI. 8 (whole); 9. 53.
