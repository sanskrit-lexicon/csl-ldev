{%Sarga%} (II)¦ — the order of creation; a form of Brahman
known as Puruṣa and Kṣetrajña with the aid of Pradhāna
originated mahat tatva out of which was born ahamkāra;
engaged further in creation, the creator engendered the rudi-
ment of sound (śabdatanmātṛkam) from which was pro-
duced, ākāśa or ether; it was invested with śabda or sound;
then was created Vāyu, invested with the rudiment of
touch, fire invested with the rudiment of rūpa or form,
waters invested with the rudiment of taste; and lastly an
aggregate of all this (earth) originates, of which smell is
the property; those rudimental elements are designated
aviśeṣas or devoid of qualities and this goes by the name of
elemental creation; from ahamkāra are again produced the
ten organs of sense and the ten divinities along with the
eleventh, mind. These several elements could not by them-
selves produce and therefore there was a blending; and the
result of this compound was the formation of an egg-like
aṇḍa, where figures the Lord in vyakta rūpa; its womb being
Meru and its water being the oceans containing all worlds,
Gods and men, surrounded outside by seven envelopes like
elements of fire, water etc.; first was one of darkness of five
Parvas: darkness, illusion, blindness, ignorance, and of no
light; three prākṛta sargas — {%mahata, bhūta,%} and {%aindri-%}
{%yaka;%} three Vaikṛta sargas — {%mukhya sarga, Tairyakyoni,%}
{%deva sarga arvāksrotasa%} and {%anugraha sarga;%} the ninth
[Page3-557+ 27]
sarga was named {%Kaumāra;%} then came the creation of devās,
asuras, pitṛs and men.
