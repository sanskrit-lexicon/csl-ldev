<div n="lb"/>her eldest brother Rukmi (s.v.) to give her in marriage to
<div n="lb"/>Caidya, she sent a letter through a Brāhmaṇa to Kṛṣṇa show-
<div n="lb"/>ing her unflinching devotion to him and requesting that she
<div n="lb"/>might be carried off when she would be on her way to the
<div n="lb"/>Devī temple on the day prior to the wedding as was the
<div n="lb"/>custom. That day she had her bath and decked herself

<div n="lb"/>having heard from Kṛṣṇa, when the Brāhmaṇa came to tell
<div n="lb"/>her that Kṛṣṇa would do the needful. Citizens were also
<div n="lb"/>for her marriage with Kṛṣṇa. Well guarded and accom-
<div n="lb"/>panied by singing and dancing, Rukmiṇī entered the temple
<div n="lb"/>and prayed for Kṛṣṇa's hand. After worshipping Indrāṇī
<div n="lb"/>nearby she returned when Kṛṣṇa carried her away in his
<div n="lb"/>chariot. Seeing the party of Caidya pursuing him, Rukmiṇī
<div n="lb"/>became nervous when Kṛṣṇa consoled her. When Caidya
<div n="lb"/>was about to be killed by Kṛṣṇa she appealed to the Lord to
<div n="lb"/>spare him; Rāma consoled her. The regular marriage and
<div n="lb"/>festivities followed.<sup>2</sup> Mother of 11 sons and a daughter;

<div n="lb"/>and spoke words reiterating her full devotion to him. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>consoled her assuring her of his loyalty.<sup>4</sup> Grave concern at
