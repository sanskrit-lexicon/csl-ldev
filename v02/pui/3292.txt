{%Kuvalayāpīḍa%}¦ — the state elephant of Kaṃsā. When
Kṛṣṇa came to the {%Mallaraṅga%} or the wrestlers’ arena, it
was ordered that this elephant should be stationed at the
gate of the arena to attack him. When Kṛṣṇa entered the
araṅga, the mahout Ambaṣṭha led the animal against him,
when Kṛṣṇa took hold of its tail, and whirling it round and
round, hit its front when it died with the keeper. He seized
its tusks and entered the enclosure in glee. At this Kamsā
was perturbed; its keeper was killed by Rāma.
