{%Kuvalayāpīḍa%}¦ — the state elephant of Kaṃsā. When
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa came to the {%Mallaraṅga%} or the wrestlers’ arena, it
<div n="lb"/>was ordered that this elephant should be stationed at the
<div n="lb"/>gate of the arena to attack him. When Kṛṣṇa entered the
<div n="lb"/>araṅga, the mahout Ambaṣṭha led the animal against him,
<div n="lb"/>when Kṛṣṇa took hold of its tail, and whirling it round and
<div n="lb"/>round, hit its front when it died with the keeper. He seized
<div n="lb"/>its tusks and entered the enclosure in glee. At this Kamsā
<div n="lb"/>was perturbed; its keeper was killed by Rāma.
