{%Śatadhanvan%} (I)¦ — the wicked; of the race of Bhojas,
and king of Mithilā; set up Akrūra and Kṛtavarman who
were displeased with Satrājita for not giving his daughter in
marriage to them; Śatadhanvan killed Satrājita while asleep,
and walked away with the jewel; when Kṛṣṇa heard of this
from Satyabhāmā, he came back to Dvārakā from Hāstina-
pura to kill Śatadhanvan. Knowing this, the latter requested
Kṛtavarman and Akrūra for help and they refused; placing
the jewel under Akrūra's custody he rode one hundred
yojanas and on reaching Mithilā, his horse fell tired. Then
he ran on foot pursued by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa got his head cut off
but found no jewel. His death was known in Dvārakā;
knew the yoga power of Hari.
