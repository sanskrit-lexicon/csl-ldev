<div n="lb"/>and king of Mithilā; set up Akrūra and Kṛtavarman who
<div n="lb"/>were displeased with Satrājita for not giving his daughter in

<div n="lb"/>and walked away with the jewel; when Kṛṣṇa heard of this
<div n="lb"/>from Satyabhāmā, he came back to Dvārakā from Hāstina-
<div n="lb"/>pura to kill Śatadhanvan. Knowing this, the latter requested
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarman and Akrūra for help and they refused; placing
<div n="lb"/>the jewel under Akrūra's custody he rode one hundred
<div n="lb"/>yojanas and on reaching Mithilā, his horse fell tired. Then
<div n="lb"/>he ran on foot pursued by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa got his head cut off
<div n="lb"/>but found no jewel. His death was known in Dvārakā;
<div n="lb"/>knew the yoga power of Hari.
