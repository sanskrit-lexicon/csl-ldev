{%Yuvanāśva%} (II)¦ — a righteous king and a son of (Pra)
Senājit: Issueless though he had a hundred wives of whom
Gaurī was one; went to the forest, where he got up the
Aindra Iṣṭi, a sacrifice in honour of Indra. One night he
felt thirsty and drank the consecrated water from the sacri-
ficial pot. In due time a son was born splitting open the
right side of his stomach. He lived for some time and went
to Heaven. This son was the great Māndhāta (s.v.).
