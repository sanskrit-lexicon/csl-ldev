{%Duryodhana%}¦ — the eldest of the hundred sons of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra and Gāndhāri;<sup>1</sup> Subhadrā was intended by Rāma to
be given in marriage to him;<sup>2</sup> was met by Kṛtavarman and
taken leave of;<sup>3</sup> went from Balabhadra and learnt {%gadā%} from
Balarāma at Mithilā;<sup>4</sup> mistook the colour of the flooring of
the Pāṇḍava's sabhā (built by Maya) for a sheet of water
and had a nasty fall at which Bhīma and the ladies laughed.
This enraged Duryodhana who was conciliated by
Yudhiṣṭhira who sent clothes to him through Kṛṣṇa.
He did not accept them, but went home downcast;<sup>5</sup>
kept under influence Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti;<sup>6</sup>
banished the Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī to the forest
for defeat in the game of dice;<sup>7</sup> resented Sāmba's
action in taking away his daughter Lakṣmaṇā in
{%svayamvara%} and wanted to punish him; heard of Rāma's
arrival and extended welcome to him; afraid of Rāma's
prowess agreed to the marriage of his daughter to Sāmba
and gave a rich dowry;<sup>8</sup> did not feel happy over the success
of the Rājasūya, where he was in charge of the treasury;<sup>9</sup>
failed to hit the fish mark in Lakṣmaṇā's {%svayamvara;%}<sup>10</sup>
Jealous of Kṛṣṇa and Draupadī, his mind set on the latter;<sup>11</sup>
ordered Vidura's banishment for offering good counsel,
and insulted him as the son of a dāsi;<sup>12</sup> met the Pāṇḍavas in
war at Kurukṣetra; arranged in {%vyūha%} at Syamanta-
