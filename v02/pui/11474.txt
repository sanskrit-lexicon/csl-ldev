{%Rantideva%} (I)¦ — a son of Samkṛti: attained permanent
fame. He performed a sacrifice when he gave up all he had
and suffered with his family having nothing to eat for
fortyeight days. When he had something to eat, there
came a Brahmana guest and a Vṛṣala, and another guest
with dogs around him; they all shared it. When he had some-
thing to drink, there came a Pulkasa and asked for the drink
and got it. To such a high soul, the gods showed darśan.
All his followers became Yogins, himself having realised the
Yogamāyā of Viṣṇu.<sup>1</sup> Parīkṣit compared to him for his
generosity.<sup>2</sup>
