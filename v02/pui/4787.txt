{%Citraketu%} (V)¦ — a Sārvabhauma and king of Śūrasenas.
<div n="lb"/>His queen was Kṛtādyuti; though he had a number of wives
<div n="lb"/>he had no children. When he was brooding over this, there
<div n="lb"/>came the sage Angiras; getting to know his mind he per-
<div n="lb"/>formed a ritual in honour of Tvaṣṭā and the remnant of offer-
<div n="lb"/>ing was given to his eldest queen, Kṛtādyutī, who brought
<div n="lb"/>forth a son. Though the king was glad, his wives grew
<div n="lb"/>jealous and poisoned the child to death. The king, queen
<div n="lb"/>and others ceaselessly lamented. On this Angiras and
<div n="lb"/>Nārada came on the scene and consoled them. Angiras
<div n="lb"/>addressed him on the instability of life, illustrating it by the
<div n="lb"/>story of Bhoja. Nārada instructed him into a {%mantropa-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%niṣad.%} By meditating on this for seven nights, he was told,
<div n="lb"/>that he would see Sankarṣana and get over the illusion relat-
<div n="lb"/>ing to duality. So he had his purificatory bath at the Jamunā
<div n="lb"/>and was initiated into the {%vidyā%} by Nārada. By meditating
<div n="lb"/>for seven days, the king became the lord of Vidyādharas. He
<div n="lb"/>then praised Hari in the form of Ananta and had a {%darśan%}
<div n="lb"/>of the Lord.
<div n="P"/>Once he flew in the air and saw Śiva sitting with Pār-
<div n="lb"/>vatī on his lap in the presence of his attendants and others.
<div n="lb"/>He laughed at this, which enraged Pārvatī who cursed him
<div n="lb"/>to be born an Asura. Citraketu alighted from his aerial car
<div n="lb"/>and begged for pardon. After he went away, Śiva told Pār-
[Page1-603+ 27]
<div n="lb"/>vatī that Citraketu was a devotee of Hari, and hence his
<div n="lb"/>devotee also. Therefore he deserved pardon. Pārvatī was
<div n="lb"/>appeased, and Citraketu was born as Vṛtra.
<div n="P"/>Bhā. VI. Chaps. 14-17.
