{%Taittirīya%}¦ — Yajus-śākha; when Yājñavalkya vomitted
<div n="lb"/>the Yajus due to a misunderstanding with his Guru, the other
<div n="lb"/>sages who were pupils of Vaiśampāyana became transformed
<div n="lb"/>into Tittirā birds and received those portions of the Yajur-
<div n="lb"/>veda. Hence the name Taittirīya.
