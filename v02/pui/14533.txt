{%Śītāṃśu%}¦ — a son of Atri born of his tejas in tapas; fell
<div n="lb"/>down on the earth landed by the seven mind-born sons of
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpatis; Brahmā supplied him with a chariot yoked with
<div n="lb"/>a thousand white horses; the lustre spread in 21 ways in the
<div n="lb"/>earth; the vegetation became ever green and the nourisher
<div n="lb"/>of men; anointed Rājarāṭ by Brahmā in the kingdom of seeds,
<div n="lb"/>vegetation, Brahmans and waters; the 27 daughters of Dakṣa,
<div n="lb"/>known as nakṣatras given in marriage to; performed Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>sūya; for this Hiraṇyagarbha was Udgāta, Brahmā, Brahmī
<div n="lb"/>and Sadasya was Nārāyaṇa Hari; attended by Sanatkumāra
<div n="lb"/>and other sages; Dakṣiṇa was three worlds; he was served
<div n="lb"/>by nine devīs Sinī, Kūhū and others; got the title of Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>rājendra; in his pride seized forcibly the consort Tārā of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati to censure the sons of Angiras; in spite of request
<div n="lb"/>from the devas he did not yield; Tārakāmaya battle helped
<div n="lb"/>by Śukra and Rudra; Brahmā intervened and Tārā was re-
<div n="lb"/>turned to Bṛhaspati; she was pregnant and brought forth a
<div n="lb"/>son named Budha; struck by consumption, invoked Atri's
<div n="lb"/>help, got rid of the disease and became resplendent and
<div n="lb"/>the originator of a great dynasty.
