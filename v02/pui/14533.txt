{%Śītāṃśu%}¦ — a son of Atri born of his tejas in tapas; fell
down on the earth landed by the seven mind-born sons of
Prajāpatis; Brahmā supplied him with a chariot yoked with
a thousand white horses; the lustre spread in 21 ways in the
earth; the vegetation became ever green and the nourisher
of men; anointed Rājarāṭ by Brahmā in the kingdom of seeds,
vegetation, Brahmans and waters; the 27 daughters of Dakṣa,
known as nakṣatras given in marriage to; performed Rāja-
sūya; for this Hiraṇyagarbha was Udgāta, Brahmā, Brahmī
and Sadasya was Nārāyaṇa Hari; attended by Sanatkumāra
and other sages; Dakṣiṇa was three worlds; he was served
by nine devīs Sinī, Kūhū and others; got the title of Rāja-
rājendra; in his pride seized forcibly the consort Tārā of
Bṛhaspati to censure the sons of Angiras; in spite of request
from the devas he did not yield; Tārakāmaya battle helped
by Śukra and Rudra; Brahmā intervened and Tārā was re-
turned to Bṛhaspati; she was pregnant and brought forth a
son named Budha; struck by consumption, invoked Atri's
help, got rid of the disease and became resplendent and
the originator of a great dynasty.
