to-hand fight; description of; at last Indra invoked Hari, who
appeared on the scene and on him Kālanemi flung his śūla;
with the same weapon Hari flung him down; so also Mālya-
van, Māli and Sumāli were put to death. Fight continued
till Nārada stopped it.<sup>1</sup> Twelve in number, after which the
whole earth and {%yajña%} came over to the Devas.<sup>2</sup> Hearing
the Asuras slain by Hari, Diti went to the earth and
performed {%Madanadvādaśi vratam%} to get able bodied
sons to kill Indra;<sup>3</sup> one, of three hundred years between
Indra and Prahlāda. Indra with the help of Raji, a
son of Āyu vanquished him.<sup>4</sup> Asuras under Hrāda
vanquished the Gods after the battle which continued
for a hundred divine years. The gods withdrew

and the Asuras were defeated.<sup>5</sup>
