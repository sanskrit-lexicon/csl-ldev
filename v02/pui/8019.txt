{%Purañjana%} (I)¦ — a King of extensive learning, had a
<div n="lb"/>friend whose name and behaviour were not known; went
<div n="lb"/>in search of a suitable place for the realisation of various
<div n="lb"/>pleasures; this he found in a city of nine entrances resembling
[Page2-345+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>Bhogavatī on the southern side of the Himālayas. By
<div n="lb"/>accident he met a charming lady protected by a serpent and
<div n="lb"/>followed by a number of ladies and men; moved by her
<div n="lb"/>charms he requested her to be his wife and she agreed;
<div n="lb"/>For a hundred years they continued to enjoy pleasures;
<div n="lb"/>Purañjana used to visit the kingdoms, Vibhrājita, Saurabha,
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣiṇa and Uttara Pāñcālas, Grāmaka, Vaiśasa and others
<div n="lb"/>through the different entrances of the city guarded by the
<div n="lb"/>Superintendent; influenced by her charms he came com-
<div n="lb"/>pletely under her control; mad with desire for hunting,
<div n="lb"/>once he left his queen and went to the forest and after
<div n="lb"/>killing many a game, he returned home and desired to meet
<div n="lb"/>the queen whom he found lying on the bare ground in
<div n="lb"/>misery; he consoled her and once more yielded to her love
<div n="lb"/>and influence at the cost of his youth; he had 1100 sons and
<div n="lb"/>110 daughters for whom he found worthy wives and
<div n="lb"/>suitable bridegrooms; he was then engaged in animal sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fices, when the followers of Caṇḍavega, a Gandharva, attack-
<div n="lb"/>ed the city of Purañjana and the Superintendent defended
<div n="lb"/>it single-handed for 100 years. This placed the citizens and
<div n="lb"/>the kinsmen in misery.
<div n="P"/>A daughter of Kāla, once in the company of Pūru went
<div n="lb"/>to Bhaya, the Lord of the Yavanas to marry him; he adopted
<div n="lb"/>her as his sister; with her and his brother Prajvāra he set
<div n="lb"/>out to wander in the world; in his tour the Yavanas attack-
<div n="lb"/>ed the city of Purañjana; Prajvāra burnt it down; Purañ-
<div n="lb"/>jana was seized and taken to the Yavana camp; the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>animals tore him to pieces; was born as the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Vidarbha Rājasimha; married by Malayadhvaja Pāṇḍya
<div n="lb"/>and gave birth to a daughter and seven sons, all kings of the
<div n="lb"/>Drāviḍa country. When the Pāṇḍya left for penance she
<div n="lb"/>went with him and served him; she wailed at his death; and
<div n="lb"/>when about to give up her own life, a Brahmana who called
<div n="lb"/>himself her friend consoled her by saying that he and she
<div n="lb"/>were once the two Hamsas of Mānasa and that she took to
<div n="lb"/>a household life and underwent all miseries; instructed thus
<div n="lb"/>she recollected her old status and remained calm;<sup>1</sup> an allegory
[Page2-346+ 34]
<div n="lb"/>for {%Jīva%} and {%Paramātman;%} Pāñcālas are the five senses while
<div n="lb"/>the nine entrances to the city refer to the nine {%dvāras%} of the
<div n="lb"/>body; sometimes the {%Jīva%} is a male sometimes a female, and
<div n="lb"/>sometimes God, and sometimes man or beast in accordance
<div n="lb"/>with Karma.<sup>2</sup>
