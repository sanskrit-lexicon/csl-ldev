{%Ṛṣabha%} (VIII)¦ — the son of Nābhi and Sudevī (Meru-
<div n="lb"/>devī according to {%Vi., Vā. & Br. P.%}) An {%avatār%} of Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>eldest of all Kṣatra. A {%Paramahamsa.%} Had a hundred
<div n="lb"/>sons of whom Bharata was the eldest.<sup>1</sup> Nine of these
<div n="lb"/>became rulers of the nine {%dvīpas%} of the world. Eightyone
[Page1-270+ 33]
<div n="lb"/>of them became addicted to {%Karma tantra,%} and the remain-
<div n="lb"/>der nine became sages.<sup>2</sup> Indra grew jealous of him and
<div n="lb"/>stopped rains in his kingdom Ajanābha. But Ṛṣabha, in-
<div n="lb"/>voked rains by yogic powers.<sup>3</sup> As king, married Jayantī,
<div n="lb"/>bestowed on him by Indra, who gave birth to 100 sons.
<div n="lb"/>Under Ṛṣabha, his kingdom flowed with milk and honey.
<div n="lb"/>Once he went to control Brahmāvarta and proclaimed
<div n="lb"/>the importance of self-control and discipline to his
<div n="lb"/>sons and to the world at large. Installed Bharata on
<div n="lb"/>the throne, renounced life and became a wandering
<div n="lb"/>mendicant. Finding the world opposed to his yoga
<div n="lb"/>practice he adopted the vow of a python {%(ājagaram)%}
<div n="lb"/>by which he ate, chewed, drank and passed water all lying
<div n="lb"/>down. By his yogic powers he wandered through Koṅka,
<div n="lb"/>Veṅka, Kuṭaka, S. Karnāṭa, and was consumed by forest-
<div n="lb"/>fire. By listening to his story, devotion to Hari was in-
<div n="lb"/>creased. His path was followed by Sumati;<sup>4</sup> took to the
<div n="lb"/>third {%āśrama%} at Pulaha's hermitage and lived there until
<div n="lb"/>his death.<sup>5</sup>
