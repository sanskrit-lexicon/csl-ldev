{%Bhārgavā Devas%}¦ — seven Devas who live in the midst of
three worlds for 71 yugas; leave for Maharloka at the end of
the Manvantara and the three worlds become unsupported;
stars, planets, etc., become lost to their places; here these
Devas become 14 gaṇas commencing with Jita and leave for
Janaloka at the time of Saṅkalana; all creatures are destroy-
ed when a new creation sets in.
