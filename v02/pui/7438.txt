{%Pañcamukha%}¦ — a name of Brahmā: for saying that, he
<div n="lb"/>saw the beginning of an effulgence of light in the form of
<div n="lb"/>a sthambha, which Mahesvara assumed; for not seeing it,
<div n="lb"/>Siva — Bhairava removed one of Brahmā's faces; hence
<div n="lb"/>Caturmukha from that day onwards.
<div n="P"/>Br. IV. 40. 48, 56.
