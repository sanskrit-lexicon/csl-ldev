{%Prabhāsaurī%}¦ — at sunset the rays of the sun enter fire
and hence the latter is seen in the night; when the sun rises
in the morning, fire enters the sun's rays and hence the light
of fire is not seen in the day; when the sun is in the middle
of the earth night enters the waters and hence they are of
the copper colour. In the night day enters the waters and
hence waters take the white colour. Thus {%ahorātras%}
enter waters.
