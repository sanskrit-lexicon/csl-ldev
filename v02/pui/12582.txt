{%Vārāṇasī Māhātmyam%}¦ — Śiva addresses Pārvatī on, in
taking her out and showing the grandeur and majesty of the
forest and garden round about Kāśī; the place of Vidyā-
[Page3-198+ 41]
dharas, Siddhas and Cāraṇas. Here Bhagavān Piṅgala
became Gaṇeśvara and Kṣetrapāla and distributor of food
to the residents in the city. He was originally a Yakṣa, son
of Pūrṇabhadra. He devoted himself to severe austerities
and was blessed by Śiva to be a Gaṇapati.<sup>1</sup> It is
{%Avimukta tīrtha%} for here Śiva is omnipresent and
is never absent from there. All sinners who die here
become Rudras in time. Śiva stands here like a pillar,
motionless till the deluge. Every part of the city is holy.<sup>2</sup>
He who remains here for a month gets the benefit of observ-
ing the Pāśupata vow. By living permanently one gets true
emancipation. By giving up life at the Maṇikarṇikā ghat one
secures the desired goal. Perpetual life in Kāśī leads one to
union with Śiva.<sup>3</sup> Kāśī's importance on account of its sacred
stream, the Ganges; survives all deluge; Śiva addresses Pār-
vatī on the great glory of the kṣetram in terms of Parama-
yoga, Paramagati and Paramamokṣa. It is a place where
people of all {%varṇas%} attain immortality. Gifts of cow and
other things in this city are always beneficial.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is the place where Śiva got rid of the curse of Brahmā
to roam about with a skull for having cut off the fifth head
of the creator. Through the grace of Hari, the skull fell
down in Kāśī and broke into a thousand pieces.<sup>5</sup> It is the
burial ground of all the gods, the ground being the Avimukta
temple. It is the seat of Brahmā. But it deludes non-
devotees. Here Vedavyāsa resided for 12 years observing
the vow of silence. At the end of the vow he felt hungry
and asked for alms. None was able to feed him. When he
was about to curse the city, Śiva and Pārvatī took the human
form and entertained him to his satisfaction. Then Vyāsa
knew of his guests who remarked that a man of choleric
temper like himself should not live in that city. But he
was permitted to visit it twice a fortnight on Aṣṭami and
Caturdaśī days.<sup>6</sup>
