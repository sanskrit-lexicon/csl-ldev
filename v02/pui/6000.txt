{%Divodāsa%} (V)¦ — a name of Bhīmaratha, king of Kāśi;
ruined by Rākṣasa Kṣemaka. Divodāsa established his head-
quarters at the city of Gomati on the outskirts of the state;
a Rājaṛṣi, his wife Suyaśā prayed to Gaṇapati in the temple
at the city of Nikumbha for a son and as the God was not
pleased to grant her prayer even after a long time, Divodāsa
had the temple demolished and hence cursed; defeated
and slew the 100 sons of Bhadraśreni except the child
Durdama; through queen Dṛṣadvati he got a son Pratardana.
