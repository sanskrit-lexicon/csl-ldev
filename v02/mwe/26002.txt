SĀNKHYA¦, {%s.%} (A system of philosophy ascribed to the Muni
Kapila. It asserts duality {#द्वैतं,#} or the co-existence of
two principles in the universe, viz. spirit and matter.
Its doctrines being opposed to the oneness of the Vedas
led to the formation of another school called the Ve-
dānta or Uttara-Mīmānasā system, asserting the opposite
idea of unity {#एकत्वं#} or {#अद्वैतं,#} and shewing that the end or
aim of the Vedas was to inculcate the oneness of Spirit or
God) {#सांख्यः, सांख्यदर्शनं;#} ‘with the commentary,’ {#सांख्यकारिका#}.
