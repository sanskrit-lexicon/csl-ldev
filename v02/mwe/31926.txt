<div n="lb"/>Vishnu, but rather as an incarnation of the great ser-
<div n="lb"/>pent Ananta; hence he is sometimes called {#शेषः#} or {#अनन्तः#}.
<div n="lb"/>He was the son of Vasudeva by Devakī, but was trans-
<div n="lb"/>ferred from the latter to the womb of Rohiṇī, the other
<div n="lb"/>wife of Vasudeva, and hence his name, {#सङ्कर्षणः#}. Other

<div n="lb"/>{#गुप्तचरः#}. — (Strong and good) {#बलभद्रः#}.
