SYLLOGISM¦, {%s.%} {#न्यायः, अवयवी#} {%m.%} {#(न्), अवयवघटितवाक्यं, अवयवयुक्त-#}
{#वाक्यं, अवयवोपेतवाक्यं, आनुपूर्व्वं#}. A syllogism has five mem-
bers or {#अवयवाः,#} according to the Nyāya system, viz.
1. The proposition or assertion to be proved, {#प्रतिज्ञा;#} 2. the
reason given, {#हेतुः;#} 3. the example or illustration, {#उदाहरणं;#}
4. the application, {#उपनयः;#} 5. the conclusion, {#निगमनं#}. Thus,
1. ‘The hill is fiery,’ {#पर्व्वतो वह्निमान्#}. 2. ‘Because it smokes,’
{#धूमवत्त्वात्#}. 3. ‘Whatever smokes is fiery, like a culinary
hearth,’ {#यो यो धूमवान् स वह्निमान् यथा महानसः#}. 4. ‘This (hill)
has smoke which is always accompanied with fire,’ {#वह्नि-#}
{#व्याप्यधूमवान् अयं#}. 5. ‘Therefore it is fiery,’ {#तस्माद् वह्निमान्#}.
According to the Mīmānsā school, a syllogism has only
the last three members.
