<L>24548<pc>658-b<k1>re<k2>re
RE¦. This prefix is expressed in Sanskrit by {#पुनर्#} or {#प्रति,#} by
the former when ‘re’ signifies again, as in the verbs,
‘re-absorb,’ ‘re-appear;’ by the latter when it signifies
back, as in the verbs, ‘re-demand,’ ‘repay.’ In cases
where the word formed with ‘re’ is not given in this
Dictionary, the student must take the simple verb or
noun, and use the above prefixes.
