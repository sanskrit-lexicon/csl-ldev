<div n="lb"/>VEDA¦, {%s.%} {#वेदः#}. This is the name given to the four most
<div n="lb"/>ancient sacred books of the Hindūs, viz. the Ṛich or
<div n="lb"/>Ṛig-veda {#ऋग्वेदः,#} the Yajus or Yajurveda {#यजुर्वेदः,#} the
<div n="lb"/>Sāman or {#सामवेदः,#} and the Atharvan or Atharva-veda
<div n="lb"/>{#अथर्ववेदः#}. Of these the Ṛig-veda is the most celebrated.
<div n="lb"/>It consists of metrical hymns or prayers termed sūktas
<div n="lb"/>or mantras, each stanza of which is called a ṛch, ad-
<div n="lb"/>dressed chiefly to the gods of the elements, Fire, Air, the
<div n="lb"/>Sun, &c., and ascribed to different holy authors or Ṛiṣis.
<div n="lb"/>The Yajurveda consists principally of prayers and invo-
<div n="lb"/>cations applicable to the consecration of the utensils and
<div n="lb"/>materials of sacrificial worship. It is divided into two
<div n="lb"/>parts, the white and black, the former of which is attri-
<div n="lb"/>buted to the saint Yājnavalkya, and the latter to Tittiri.
<div n="lb"/>The Sama-veda is little else than a recast of the Ṛig-
<div n="lb"/>veda, being made up of many of the same hymns, broken
<div n="lb"/>into parts and arranged anew for the purpose of being
<div n="lb"/>chanted during various expiatory ceremonies. The
<div n="lb"/>Atharva-veda has little in common with the other three
<div n="lb"/>in its character or style. Its language indicates a
<div n="lb"/>different and later era, and it may therefore be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as a supplement to the three others. Hence it is that
<div n="lb"/>many passages are found in Sanskrit writings which
<div n="lb"/>limit the number of Vedas to three. Each of the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>consists of two distinct component parts, viz. the Mantra
<div n="lb"/>[Page827-b+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>portion, and the Brāhmaṇa portion. The Mantra por-
<div n="lb"/>tion is a collection or Sanhitā of sūktas, or hymns as
<div n="lb"/>above described, the composition of which is supposed
<div n="lb"/>to have taken place about twelve or thirteen centuries
<div n="lb"/>B. C.; the Brāhmaṇa portion is a collection of rules for
<div n="lb"/>the repetition of the Mantras at certain particular cere-
<div n="lb"/>monies, with directions for the performance of such
<div n="lb"/>ceremonies, and illustrative remarks explanatory of their
<div n="lb"/>origin. This portion of the Vedas is supposed to have
<div n="lb"/>been composed about seven or eight centuries B. C.
<div n="lb"/>The Vedas were collected and arranged into books and
<div n="lb"/>chapters by the sage Kṛṣnadvaipayana, surnamed
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa, who is supposed to have lived in the eleventh
<div n="lb"/>century after Christ; {%see%} under PURĀNA. The Vedas
<div n="lb"/>collectively are often called {#श्रुतिः#} {%f.%} or {#आम्नायः,#} and a
<div n="lb"/>Brāhman conversant with them {#श्रोत्रियः#} or {#श्रुतिज्ञः#}. — (The
<div n="lb"/>three Vedas) {#वेदत्रयं -यी, त्रयी;#} ‘duty enjoined by them,’
<div n="lb"/>{#त्रयीधर्म्मः#}. — (The four Vedas) {#चतुर्वेदं;#} ‘one who is conver-
<div n="lb"/>sant with them,’ {#चतुर्विद्यः, चतुर्वेदः, चातुर्वैद्यः#}. The Āyur-veda,
<div n="lb"/>or code of medicine, is regarded by some as a part of
<div n="lb"/>the Atharva-veda, by others as an Upa-veda, {%see%} under
<div n="lb"/>SCRIPTURE.
