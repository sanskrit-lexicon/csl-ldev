VEDA¦, {%s.%} {#वेदः#}. This is the name given to the four most
ancient sacred books of the Hindūs, viz. the Ṛich or
Ṛig-veda {#ऋग्वेदः,#} the Yajus or Yajurveda {#यजुर्वेदः,#} the
Sāman or {#सामवेदः,#} and the Atharvan or Atharva-veda
{#अथर्ववेदः#}. Of these the Ṛig-veda is the most celebrated.
It consists of metrical hymns or prayers termed sūktas
or mantras, each stanza of which is called a ṛch, ad-
dressed chiefly to the gods of the elements, Fire, Air, the
Sun, &c., and ascribed to different holy authors or Ṛiṣis.
The Yajurveda consists principally of prayers and invo-
cations applicable to the consecration of the utensils and
materials of sacrificial worship. It is divided into two
parts, the white and black, the former of which is attri-
buted to the saint Yājnavalkya, and the latter to Tittiri.
The Sama-veda is little else than a recast of the Ṛig-
veda, being made up of many of the same hymns, broken
into parts and arranged anew for the purpose of being
chanted during various expiatory ceremonies. The
Atharva-veda has little in common with the other three
in its character or style. Its language indicates a
different and later era, and it may therefore be regarded
as a supplement to the three others. Hence it is that
many passages are found in Sanskrit writings which
limit the number of Vedas to three. Each of the Vedas
consists of two distinct component parts, viz. the Mantra
[Page827-b+ 51]
portion, and the Brāhmaṇa portion. The Mantra por-
tion is a collection or Sanhitā of sūktas, or hymns as
above described, the composition of which is supposed
to have taken place about twelve or thirteen centuries
B. C.; the Brāhmaṇa portion is a collection of rules for
the repetition of the Mantras at certain particular cere-
monies, with directions for the performance of such
ceremonies, and illustrative remarks explanatory of their
origin. This portion of the Vedas is supposed to have
been composed about seven or eight centuries B. C.
The Vedas were collected and arranged into books and
chapters by the sage Kṛṣnadvaipayana, surnamed
Vyāsa, who is supposed to have lived in the eleventh
century after Christ; {%see%} under PURĀNA. The Vedas
collectively are often called {#श्रुतिः#} {%f.%} or {#आम्नायः,#} and a
Brāhman conversant with them {#श्रोत्रियः#} or {#श्रुतिज्ञः#}. — (The
three Vedas) {#वेदत्रयं -यी, त्रयी;#} ‘duty enjoined by them,’
{#त्रयीधर्म्मः#}. — (The four Vedas) {#चतुर्वेदं;#} ‘one who is conver-
sant with them,’ {#चतुर्विद्यः, चतुर्वेदः, चातुर्वैद्यः#}. The Āyur-veda,
or code of medicine, is regarded by some as a part of
the Atharva-veda, by others as an Upa-veda, {%see%} under
SCRIPTURE.
