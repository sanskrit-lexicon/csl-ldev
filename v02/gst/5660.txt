{#अप्सरस्#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-राः#}) The name of female divinities,
not often met with in the three Vedas, but frequently in the
classical poetry:
<div n="P"><sup>a.</sup> The {%Sāmaveda%} makes no mention of them; the {%Ṛgveda%}
names as such Urvaśī, (the {%Anukram.%} of the {%Ṛgv.%} two
Apsarasas Śikhaṇḍinī as authoresses of a hymn); in the {%Vā-%}
{%jasan. S.%} of the {%Yajurveda%} there occur five pairs of Apsarasas:
Puñjikasthalā and Kratusthalā, Menakā and Śahajanyā,
Pramlochantī and Anumlochantī, Visvāchī and Ghṛtāchī,
Urvaśī and Pūrvachitti; in the {%Śatapathabr.,%} Śakuntalā and
Urvaśī; in the {%Atharvaveda,%} Ugrampaśyā, Ugrajit and Rā-
ṣṭrabhṛt. In the {%Ādiparvan%} of the {%Mahābhārata%} several of
these divinities are enumerated under two heads, the first
comprising: Anūchānā ({%v. l.%} Anūnā, another Ms. Anṛṇā),
Anavadyā, Guṇamukhyā ({%v. l.%} Priyamukhyā), Guṇāvarā
({%v. l.%} Gaṇāvarā), Adrikā ({%v. l.%} Attikā), Somā ({%v. l.%} Sāchī),
Miśrakeśī, Alambuṣā, Marīchi, Śuchikā ({%v. l.%} Iṣukā),
Vidyutparṇā, Tilottamā ({%v. l.%} Tulā and Anaghā), Ambikā,
[Page222-b+ 56]
Lakṣaṇā, Kṣemā, Devī, Rambhā, Manoramā [{%v. l.%} Mano-
harā, or devī ‘divine’ and manoramā (or manoharā) ‘beauti-
ful’ are perhaps epithets of Rambhā], Asitā, Subāhu, Su-
priyā, Vapus ({%v. l.%} Suvapus), Puṇḍarīkā, Sugandhā, Su-
rasā ({%v. l.%} Surathā), Pramāthinī, Kāmyā and Śāradvatī;
the second comprising the following eleven: Menakā, Saha-
janyā, Karṇikā ({%v. l.%} Parṇini), Puñjikasthalā, Ṛtusthalā
({%v. l.%} Kratusthalā), Ghṛtāchī, Viśvāchī, Pūrvachitti ({%v. l.%}
Viprachitti), Umlochā, Pramlochā ({%v. l.%} Pramlā) and Ur-
vaśī. ({%Hemachandra%} mentions two Apsaras Saudāminī and
Chitrā; other names too, will occur in the following.)
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> As regards their origin, the {%Rāmāyaṇa%} makes them
arise from the Ocean when it was churned by the gods for
obtaining the Amṛta; {%Manu%} represents them as one of the
creations of the seven Manus, themselves created by the
seven Prajāpatis Marīchi, Atri &c.; in the later mythology
they are daughters of Kaśyapa by Muni (e. g. according to
the {%Viṣṇu-%} and {%Bhāgav. Pur.%}), or by Vāch (according to
the {%Padma P.%}), or some by Muni, some by Prādhā, while
a third class is created by the mere will of Kaśyapa; thus,
according to the {%Harivanśa,%} the daughters of K. and Prādhā
are: Anavadyā, Anūkā, Anūnā ({%v. l.%} Aruṇā), Aruṇapriyā,
Anugā, Subhagā, (two names seem omitted); of K. and
Muni: Alambuṣā, Miśrakeśī, Puṇḍarīkā, Tilottamā, Su-
rūpā, Lakṣmaṇā, Kṣemā, Rambhā, Manoramā (or ‘the
beautiful Rambhā’), Asitā, Subāhu, Suvrittā, Sumukhī,
Supriyā, Sugandhā, Surasā ({%v. l.%} Suramā), Pramāthinī,
Kāmyā ({%v. l.%} Kāśyā) and Śāradvatī; those created by the
will of the Prajāpati and called the {%vaidik%} Apsarasas are:
Menakā, Sahajanyā, Parṇinī ({%v. l.%} Parṇikā), Puñjikasthalā,
Ghṛtasthalā, Ghṛtāchi, Visvāchī, Urvaśī, Anumlochā,
Pramlochā and Manovatī. (The two Śikhaṇdinī of the
{%Anukr.%} of the {%Ṛgv.%} are also daughters of K.)--Another
and more elaborate list is that of the {%Vāyu-Purāṇa.%} [It is
omitted in two E. I. H. Mss. of this P. and very incorrect
in four other Mss. that I consulted, belonging severally
to the E. I. H., the R. A. S. and the R. S.; in some in-
stances, as Miśrakeśī instead of Mitrakeśī, Puñjikasthalā
p. Puñjakastanā, Kratusthalā p. Vṛtastanā &c. the cor-
rection appeared safe, in others it was preferable to give
the doubtful reading.] This Purāṇa mentions in the first
place thirty-four Apsarasas, called the Gandharva-Apsarasas
or wives of the Gandharvas, and daughters of Kaśyapa by
Muni (but the Mss. in question give only twenty-nine, or
if Devī and Manoramā are proper names, thirty-one names):
Antachārā, Daśavadyā(?), Priyaśiṣyā, Surottamā, Miśra-
keśī, Śāchī, Piṇḍinī ({%v. l.%} Parṇinī), Alambuṣā, Mārīchi,
Śuchikā, Vidyudvarṇā, Tilottamā, Adrikā, Lakṣaṇā(?),
Devī, Rambhā, Manoramā (or: the divine, beautiful Rambhā),
Sucharā, Subāhū, Sūrṇitā (?, Sūnṛtā ?), Supratiṣṭhitā, Pu-
ṇḍarīkā, Akṣagandhā ({%v. l.%} Sugandhā), Sudantā, Surasā, He-
mā, Śāradvatī, Suvrittā, Kamalāchayā, Subhujā, Hansapādā;
these are called the {%laukikī%} or {%worldly%} Apsarasas; then six
daughters of Gandharvas: Suyaśā, Gāndharvī, Vidyāvatī,
Aśvavatī, Sumukhī, Varānanā; and four daughters of Suyaśā,
also called Apsaras: Lauheyī, Bharatā, Kṛśāṅgī ({%v. l.%} Kṛ-
[Page223-a+ 56]
ṣṇāṅgī) and Viśālā; then eight daughters of Kaśyapa by
Ariṣṭā: Anavadyā, Anavaśā, Atyantamadanapriyā, Surūpā,
Subhagā, Bhāsī, Manovatī and Sukeśī; then the {%daivati%} or
{%divine%} Apsarasas: Vedakā (sic, but {%v. l.%} Menakā), Sahajanyā,
Parṇinī, Puñjikasthalā, Kratusthalā, Ghṛtāchī, Viśvāchī,
Pūrvachitti, Pramlochā, Anumlochantī, to whom are added
Urvaśī, born from the thigh of Nārāyaṇa, and Menakā
the daughter of Brahman. Besides these the {%Vāyu-P.%} men-
tions fourteen Gaṇas or classes of Apsarasas: 1. The Śobha-
yantyas, produced by the mind (manas) of Brahman, 2. the
Vegavatyas born in heaven (? the Mss. {#स्वरिष्टाः#}), 3. the
Ūryās (?, perhaps Ūrjas, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 41.), produced by
Agni (comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 38.), 4. the Āyuvatyas, by the Sun
(comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 39.), 5. the Śubhañcharās, by Wind (comp.
{%Vājas.%} 18. 41.), 6. the Kuravas(?), by the Moon (Mss.: {#…#}
{#सोमस्य ज्ञेयास्ते कुरवः शुभाः;#} perhaps their name is Bheku-
rayas, as occurring also in another passage of one Ms.;
comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 40.), 7. the Śubhās (?), by Sacrifice (; their
name is perhaps Stāvās, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 42.), 8. the Vahna-
yas (? perhaps Eṣṭayas, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 43.), by the Rich-
and Sāman-verses, 9. the Amṛtās, by Amṛta, 10. the Mu-
das by Water; (three Mss. have {#वायुत्पन्नाः#} and one Ms.
{#वायूत्पन्नाः#} which however must be corrected {#वार्युत्पन्नाः,#}
since {#वायुजाः#} occurs under 5; comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 38), 11. the
Bhavās(?), by the Earth, 12. the Ruchas, by Lightning,
13. the Bhairavās, by Death (comp. {%Vājas.%} 24. 37.) and 14.
the Śoṣayantyas, by Love; (this list is probably meant
by the author of the Kādambarī, who--ed. Calc. p. 122--
professes to give fourteen classes of Apsarasas, but, in fact,
only names thirteen, fathering moreover one class on Da-
ksha).--The {%Harivanśa%} (v. 6798) speaks of seven Gaṇas
of Apsarasas, but, without naming them. {%Vyādi,%} ad quoted
in a comm. on Hemachandra, mentions an Apsaras Prabhāvatī
as born from a hole in the ground for receiving the fire con-
secrated to Brahman, Vedavatī as born from an altar-ground,
Sulochanā from Yama, Urvaśī from the left thigh of Viṣṇu,
Rambhā from the mouth of Brahman, Chitralekhā from
his hand, and from his head Mahāchittā, Kākalikā, Mā-
rīchī, Sūchikā, Vidyutparṇā, Tilottamā, Adrikā, Lakṣaṇā,
Kṣemā, the divine and beautiful Rāmā (or Divyā, Rāmā,
Manoramā), Hemā, Sugandhā, Suvasu, Subāhū, Suvratā,
Asitā, Śāradvatī, Puṇḍarīkā, Surasā, Sūnṛtā, Suvātā,
Kāmalā, Hansapadī, Sumukhī, Menakā, Sahajanyā, Parṇinī,
Puñjikasthalā, Ṛtusthalā, Ghṛtāchī and Viśvāchī.
<div n="P"><sup>c.</sup> Originally these divinities seem to have been personi-
fications of the vapours which are attracted by the Sun
and form into mist or clouds; their character may be thus
interpreted in the few hymns of the Ṛgveda where mention
is made of them. At a subsequent period when the Gan-
dharva of the Ṛgveda who personifies there especially the
Fire of the Sun, expanded into the Fire of Lightning, the
rays of the Moon and other attributes of the elementary
life of heaven as well as into pious acts referring to it, the
Apsarasas become divinities which represent phenomena or
objects both of a physical and ethical kind closely associated
with that life; thus in the {%Yajurveda%} Sunbeams are called
[Page223-b+ 56]
the Apsarasas associated with the Gandharva who is the Sun;
Plants are termed the Apsarasas associated with the Gan-
dharva Fire: Constellations are the Apsarasas of the Gan-
dharva Moon: Waters the A. of the G. Wind: Sacrificial gifts
the A. of the G. Sacrifice: Rich- and Sāman hymns the A.
of the G. Manas (creating will); in another passage of the
{%Vājas.%} Fire is connected ({%Mahīdhara:%} in the two months
of Vasanta or spring) with the two Apsarasas Puñjikasthalā
and Kratusthalā (considered by the comm. as personifi-
cations of a principal and an intermediate point of the com-
pass), Wind (Viswakarman) with Menakā and Sahajanyā
({%comm.:%} in the two months of Grīṣma or the hot season),
Sun (Viśvavyachas) with Pramlochantī and Anumlochantī
({%comm.:%} in the two months of Varṣā or the rainy season),
Sacrifice (Samyadvasu) with Viśvāchī and Ghṛtāchī ({%comm.:%}
in the two months of Śarad or the sultry season), Parjanya
(Arvāgvasu) with Urvaśī and Pūrvachitti ({%comm.:%} in the
two months of Hemanta or the cold season).--This latter
idea becomes then more systematized in the {%Purāṇas,%} when
a description is given of the Genii that attend the chariot
of the Sun in its yearly course; thus the {%Bhāgavata P.%}
mentions that besides the Ṛṣis, Gandharvas &c. also one
Gaṇa or troupe of Apsarasas pays adoration to the Sun every
month; and the {%Viṣṇu P.,%} that among the Genii who pre-
side each in every month over the chariot of the Sun, Kra-
tusthalā performs this function in the month Madhu, Punji-
kasthalā in the month Mādhava, Menā in Śuchi, Sahajanyā
in Śukra, Pramlochā in Nabhas, Anumlochā in Bhādra-
pada, Ghṛtachī in Āsvina, Visvāchī in Kārttika, Urvaśī
in Agrahāyaṇa, Pūrvachitti in Pausha, Tilottamā in Māgha,
Rambhā in Phālguna; an analogous description is given in
the {%Vāyu P.%} with the only difference that Viprachitti takes
the place of Pūrvachitti, apparently with less correctness,
as this account is a strict developement of the quoted pas-
sage of the Yajurveda ({%Vājas.%} 15. 15-19.). In the last my-
thological epoch when the Gandharvas have saved from
their elementary nature merely so much as to be the musi-
cians in the paradise of Indra, the Apsarasas appear amongst
other subordinate deities which share in the merry life of
Indra's heaven, as the wives of the Gandharvas, but more
especially as wives of a licentious sort, and they are pro-
mised therefore, too, as a reward to heroes fallen in battle
when they are received in the paradise of Indra; and while,
in the Ṛgveda, they assist Soma to pour down his floods,
they descend in the epic literature on earth merely to shake
the virtue of penitent Sages and to deprive them of the
power they would have otherwise acquired through un-
broken austerities.--To this association of the ethical with
the physical element in the character of the Apsarasas
belongs also that view expressed by {%Manu,%} according to
which the Soul in its transmigrations is reborn as Apsaras
when it was in its previous existence under the influence of
rajas or passion; and probably too the circumstance, that in
the {%Atharvaveda%} they are fond of dice, and three Apsarasas,
whose names are given above, are supposed to have the
power of removing faults committed at gambling with dice.
[Page224-a+ 56]
<div n="P">The word occurs also in the form {#अप्सरा,#} and may be
written, besides, {#अप्स्सरस्#} accord. to {%Kātyāyana,%} or {#अफ्सरस्#}
accord. to {%Pauṣkarasādi;%} (these latter forms however are not
varieties of the form {#अप्सरस्,#} but the consequence of general
Sandhi rules; the first is given as an instance by {%Patanjali,%}
the latter by the {%Kāśikā%}). E. {#अप्#} and {#सरस्#} ({#सृ,#} uṇ. aff.
{#असि#}), {%liter.%} ‘coming from the waters’ ({%Rāyam.:%} {#वारुणप्र-#}
{#धानत्वादद्भ्यः सृता इत्यप्सरसः#}); this is the most probable
E.; it is given also by {%Yāska%} who mentions besides an im-
probable one by {%Śākapūṇi,%} viz. from {#अप्सस्#} ‘form, beauty’
which he completes by adding the latter part of the comp.,
{#रस्#} (from {#रा#}), when the word would mean according to
him, ‘a woman endowed with beauty ({#रूपवती#})’ or ‘one
by whom beauty is taken ({#तद्#}--scil. {#रूपम्--अनयात्तम्#})’
or ‘one to whom beauty is given ({#तदस्यै दत्तम्#})’; a similar
E. is intended by the passage of the {%Śatapath.%} (IX. 4. 1. 4.):
{#गन्धर्वाप्सरसो हि भूत्वोदक्रामन्नथो गन्धेन च वै रूपेण च ग-#}
{#न्धर्वाप्सरसश्चरन्ति,#} on which the comm. of {%Sāyaṇa%} runs
thus (E. I. H. 149): {#गन्धेन च#} (Ms. {#चा#} sic) {#वै रूपेण#}
(Ms. {#वै श्च रूपेण#} sic) {#च गन्धर्वाप्सरसश्चरन्तीत्यनेन#} (Ms. {#ग-#}
{#न्धर्वोप्स°°#} sic) {#गन्धर्वशब्दोऽप्सरःशब्दश्च निरुच्यते । गन्धेन#}
{#विशन्तीति#} (Ms. {#गन्धोन विशिन्तीति#} sic) {#गन्धर्वाः । अप्सशब्देन#}
(Ms. {#अप्रशब्देन#} sic) {#रूपमभिधीयते । तेन विशिष्टाश्चरन्तीति#}
{#अप्सरसः । गन्धर्वाप्सरसः । गन्धर्वाप्सरःशब्दयोः पृषोदरादि-#}
{#त्वात्#} ({%Pāṇ.%} VI. 3. 109.) {#वर्णागमादिति विधानेनोक्त एवार्थे#}
{#साधुत्वं द्रष्टव्यम्,#} when the word would literally mean: ‘go-
ing (distinguished) with beauty’; (comp. the quotation of
{%Patanj.%} on {%Pāṇ.%} V. 2. 95: {#उर्वशी वै रूपिण्यप्सरसाम्#}), but
this kind of popular E. of the word is as little plausible as
that given by the {%Rāmāyaṇa,%} according to which these deities
would derive their name from the circumstance that they
arose from the essence ({#रस#}) which was obtained from the
churning ‘in the waters’ ({#अप्सु#}) of the ocean.
