{#अप्सरस्#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-राः#}) The name of female divinities,
<div n="lb">not often met with in the three Vedas, but frequently in the
<div n="lb">classical poetry:
<div n="P"><sup>a.</sup> The {%Sāmaveda%} makes no mention of them; the {%Ṛgveda%}
<div n="lb">names as such Urvaśī, (the {%Anukram.%} of the {%Ṛgv.%} two
<div n="lb">Apsarasas Śikhaṇḍinī as authoresses of a hymn); in the {%Vā-%}
<div n="lb">{%jasan. S.%} of the {%Yajurveda%} there occur five pairs of Apsarasas:
<div n="lb">Puñjikasthalā and Kratusthalā, Menakā and Śahajanyā,
<div n="lb">Pramlochantī and Anumlochantī, Visvāchī and Ghṛtāchī,
<div n="lb">Urvaśī and Pūrvachitti; in the {%Śatapathabr.,%} Śakuntalā and
<div n="lb">Urvaśī; in the {%Atharvaveda,%} Ugrampaśyā, Ugrajit and Rā-
<div n="lb">ṣṭrabhṛt. In the {%Ādiparvan%} of the {%Mahābhārata%} several of
<div n="lb">these divinities are enumerated under two heads, the first
<div n="lb">comprising: Anūchānā ({%v. l.%} Anūnā, another Ms. Anṛṇā),
<div n="lb">Anavadyā, Guṇamukhyā ({%v. l.%} Priyamukhyā), Guṇāvarā
<div n="lb">({%v. l.%} Gaṇāvarā), Adrikā ({%v. l.%} Attikā), Somā ({%v. l.%} Sāchī),
<div n="lb">Miśrakeśī, Alambuṣā, Marīchi, Śuchikā ({%v. l.%} Iṣukā),
<div n="lb">Vidyutparṇā, Tilottamā ({%v. l.%} Tulā and Anaghā), Ambikā,
[Page222-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">Lakṣaṇā, Kṣemā, Devī, Rambhā, Manoramā [{%v. l.%} Mano-
<div n="lb">harā, or devī ‘divine’ and manoramā (or manoharā) ‘beauti-
<div n="lb">ful’ are perhaps epithets of Rambhā], Asitā, Subāhu, Su-
<div n="lb">priyā, Vapus ({%v. l.%} Suvapus), Puṇḍarīkā, Sugandhā, Su-
<div n="lb">rasā ({%v. l.%} Surathā), Pramāthinī, Kāmyā and Śāradvatī;
<div n="lb">the second comprising the following eleven: Menakā, Saha-
<div n="lb">janyā, Karṇikā ({%v. l.%} Parṇini), Puñjikasthalā, Ṛtusthalā
<div n="lb">({%v. l.%} Kratusthalā), Ghṛtāchī, Viśvāchī, Pūrvachitti ({%v. l.%}
<div n="lb">Viprachitti), Umlochā, Pramlochā ({%v. l.%} Pramlā) and Ur-
<div n="lb">vaśī. ({%Hemachandra%} mentions two Apsaras Saudāminī and
<div n="lb">Chitrā; other names too, will occur in the following.)
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> As regards their origin, the {%Rāmāyaṇa%} makes them
<div n="lb">arise from the Ocean when it was churned by the gods for
<div n="lb">obtaining the Amṛta; {%Manu%} represents them as one of the
<div n="lb">creations of the seven Manus, themselves created by the
<div n="lb">seven Prajāpatis Marīchi, Atri &c.; in the later mythology
<div n="lb">they are daughters of Kaśyapa by Muni (e. g. according to
<div n="lb">the {%Viṣṇu-%} and {%Bhāgav. Pur.%}), or by Vāch (according to
<div n="lb">the {%Padma P.%}), or some by Muni, some by Prādhā, while
<div n="lb">a third class is created by the mere will of Kaśyapa; thus,
<div n="lb">according to the {%Harivanśa,%} the daughters of K. and Prādhā
<div n="lb">are: Anavadyā, Anūkā, Anūnā ({%v. l.%} Aruṇā), Aruṇapriyā,
<div n="lb">Anugā, Subhagā, (two names seem omitted); of K. and
<div n="lb">Muni: Alambuṣā, Miśrakeśī, Puṇḍarīkā, Tilottamā, Su-
<div n="lb">rūpā, Lakṣmaṇā, Kṣemā, Rambhā, Manoramā (or ‘the
<div n="lb">beautiful Rambhā’), Asitā, Subāhu, Suvrittā, Sumukhī,
<div n="lb">Supriyā, Sugandhā, Surasā ({%v. l.%} Suramā), Pramāthinī,
<div n="lb">Kāmyā ({%v. l.%} Kāśyā) and Śāradvatī; those created by the
<div n="lb">will of the Prajāpati and called the {%vaidik%} Apsarasas are:
<div n="lb">Menakā, Sahajanyā, Parṇinī ({%v. l.%} Parṇikā), Puñjikasthalā,
<div n="lb">Ghṛtasthalā, Ghṛtāchi, Visvāchī, Urvaśī, Anumlochā,
<div n="lb">Pramlochā and Manovatī. (The two Śikhaṇdinī of the
<div n="lb">{%Anukr.%} of the {%Ṛgv.%} are also daughters of K.)--Another
<div n="lb">and more elaborate list is that of the {%Vāyu-Purāṇa.%} [It is
<div n="lb">omitted in two E. I. H. Mss. of this P. and very incorrect
<div n="lb">in four other Mss. that I consulted, belonging severally
<div n="lb">to the E. I. H., the R. A. S. and the R. S.; in some in-
<div n="lb">stances, as Miśrakeśī instead of Mitrakeśī, Puñjikasthalā
<div n="lb">p. Puñjakastanā, Kratusthalā p. Vṛtastanā &c. the cor-
<div n="lb">rection appeared safe, in others it was preferable to give
<div n="lb">the doubtful reading.] This Purāṇa mentions in the first
<div n="lb">place thirty-four Apsarasas, called the Gandharva-Apsarasas
<div n="lb">or wives of the Gandharvas, and daughters of Kaśyapa by
<div n="lb">Muni (but the Mss. in question give only twenty-nine, or
<div n="lb">if Devī and Manoramā are proper names, thirty-one names):
<div n="lb">Antachārā, Daśavadyā(?), Priyaśiṣyā, Surottamā, Miśra-
<div n="lb">keśī, Śāchī, Piṇḍinī ({%v. l.%} Parṇinī), Alambuṣā, Mārīchi,
<div n="lb">Śuchikā, Vidyudvarṇā, Tilottamā, Adrikā, Lakṣaṇā(?),
<div n="lb">Devī, Rambhā, Manoramā (or: the divine, beautiful Rambhā),
<div n="lb">Sucharā, Subāhū, Sūrṇitā (?, Sūnṛtā ?), Supratiṣṭhitā, Pu-
<div n="lb">ṇḍarīkā, Akṣagandhā ({%v. l.%} Sugandhā), Sudantā, Surasā, He-
<div n="lb">mā, Śāradvatī, Suvrittā, Kamalāchayā, Subhujā, Hansapādā;
<div n="lb">these are called the {%laukikī%} or {%worldly%} Apsarasas; then six
<div n="lb">daughters of Gandharvas: Suyaśā, Gāndharvī, Vidyāvatī,
<div n="lb">Aśvavatī, Sumukhī, Varānanā; and four daughters of Suyaśā,
<div n="lb">also called Apsaras: Lauheyī, Bharatā, Kṛśāṅgī ({%v. l.%} Kṛ-
[Page223-a+ 56]
<div n="lb">ṣṇāṅgī) and Viśālā; then eight daughters of Kaśyapa by
<div n="lb">Ariṣṭā: Anavadyā, Anavaśā, Atyantamadanapriyā, Surūpā,
<div n="lb">Subhagā, Bhāsī, Manovatī and Sukeśī; then the {%daivati%} or
<div n="lb">{%divine%} Apsarasas: Vedakā (sic, but {%v. l.%} Menakā), Sahajanyā,
<div n="lb">Parṇinī, Puñjikasthalā, Kratusthalā, Ghṛtāchī, Viśvāchī,
<div n="lb">Pūrvachitti, Pramlochā, Anumlochantī, to whom are added
<div n="lb">Urvaśī, born from the thigh of Nārāyaṇa, and Menakā
<div n="lb">the daughter of Brahman. Besides these the {%Vāyu-P.%} men-
<div n="lb">tions fourteen Gaṇas or classes of Apsarasas: 1. The Śobha-
<div n="lb">yantyas, produced by the mind (manas) of Brahman, 2. the
<div n="lb">Vegavatyas born in heaven (? the Mss. {#स्वरिष्टाः#}), 3. the
<div n="lb">Ūryās (?, perhaps Ūrjas, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 41.), produced by
<div n="lb">Agni (comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 38.), 4. the Āyuvatyas, by the Sun
<div n="lb">(comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 39.), 5. the Śubhañcharās, by Wind (comp.
<div n="lb">{%Vājas.%} 18. 41.), 6. the Kuravas(?), by the Moon (Mss.: {#…#}
<div n="lb">{#सोमस्य ज्ञेयास्ते कुरवः शुभाः;#} perhaps their name is Bheku-
<div n="lb">rayas, as occurring also in another passage of one Ms.;
<div n="lb">comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 40.), 7. the Śubhās (?), by Sacrifice (; their
<div n="lb">name is perhaps Stāvās, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 42.), 8. the Vahna-
<div n="lb">yas (? perhaps Eṣṭayas, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 43.), by the Rich-
<div n="lb">and Sāman-verses, 9. the Amṛtās, by Amṛta, 10. the Mu-
<div n="lb">das by Water; (three Mss. have {#वायुत्पन्नाः#} and one Ms.
<div n="lb">{#वायूत्पन्नाः#} which however must be corrected {#वार्युत्पन्नाः,#}
<div n="lb">since {#वायुजाः#} occurs under 5; comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 38), 11. the
<div n="lb">Bhavās(?), by the Earth, 12. the Ruchas, by Lightning,
<div n="lb">13. the Bhairavās, by Death (comp. {%Vājas.%} 24. 37.) and 14.
<div n="lb">the Śoṣayantyas, by Love; (this list is probably meant
<div n="lb">by the author of the Kādambarī, who--ed. Calc. p. 122--
<div n="lb">professes to give fourteen classes of Apsarasas, but, in fact,
<div n="lb">only names thirteen, fathering moreover one class on Da-
<div n="lb">ksha).--The {%Harivanśa%} (v. 6798) speaks of seven Gaṇas
<div n="lb">of Apsarasas, but, without naming them. {%Vyādi,%} ad quoted
<div n="lb">in a comm. on Hemachandra, mentions an Apsaras Prabhāvatī
<div n="lb">as born from a hole in the ground for receiving the fire con-
<div n="lb">secrated to Brahman, Vedavatī as born from an altar-ground,
<div n="lb">Sulochanā from Yama, Urvaśī from the left thigh of Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb">Rambhā from the mouth of Brahman, Chitralekhā from
<div n="lb">his hand, and from his head Mahāchittā, Kākalikā, Mā-
<div n="lb">rīchī, Sūchikā, Vidyutparṇā, Tilottamā, Adrikā, Lakṣaṇā,
<div n="lb">Kṣemā, the divine and beautiful Rāmā (or Divyā, Rāmā,
<div n="lb">Manoramā), Hemā, Sugandhā, Suvasu, Subāhū, Suvratā,
<div n="lb">Asitā, Śāradvatī, Puṇḍarīkā, Surasā, Sūnṛtā, Suvātā,
<div n="lb">Kāmalā, Hansapadī, Sumukhī, Menakā, Sahajanyā, Parṇinī,
<div n="lb">Puñjikasthalā, Ṛtusthalā, Ghṛtāchī and Viśvāchī.
<div n="P"><sup>c.</sup> Originally these divinities seem to have been personi-
<div n="lb">fications of the vapours which are attracted by the Sun
<div n="lb">and form into mist or clouds; their character may be thus
<div n="lb">interpreted in the few hymns of the Ṛgveda where mention
<div n="lb">is made of them. At a subsequent period when the Gan-
<div n="lb">dharva of the Ṛgveda who personifies there especially the
<div n="lb">Fire of the Sun, expanded into the Fire of Lightning, the
<div n="lb">rays of the Moon and other attributes of the elementary
<div n="lb">life of heaven as well as into pious acts referring to it, the
<div n="lb">Apsarasas become divinities which represent phenomena or
<div n="lb">objects both of a physical and ethical kind closely associated
<div n="lb">with that life; thus in the {%Yajurveda%} Sunbeams are called
[Page223-b+ 56]
<div n="lb">the Apsarasas associated with the Gandharva who is the Sun;
<div n="lb">Plants are termed the Apsarasas associated with the Gan-
<div n="lb">dharva Fire: Constellations are the Apsarasas of the Gan-
<div n="lb">dharva Moon: Waters the A. of the G. Wind: Sacrificial gifts
<div n="lb">the A. of the G. Sacrifice: Rich- and Sāman hymns the A.
<div n="lb">of the G. Manas (creating will); in another passage of the
<div n="lb">{%Vājas.%} Fire is connected ({%Mahīdhara:%} in the two months
<div n="lb">of Vasanta or spring) with the two Apsarasas Puñjikasthalā
<div n="lb">and Kratusthalā (considered by the comm. as personifi-
<div n="lb">cations of a principal and an intermediate point of the com-
<div n="lb">pass), Wind (Viswakarman) with Menakā and Sahajanyā
<div n="lb">({%comm.:%} in the two months of Grīṣma or the hot season),
<div n="lb">Sun (Viśvavyachas) with Pramlochantī and Anumlochantī
<div n="lb">({%comm.:%} in the two months of Varṣā or the rainy season),
<div n="lb">Sacrifice (Samyadvasu) with Viśvāchī and Ghṛtāchī ({%comm.:%}
<div n="lb">in the two months of Śarad or the sultry season), Parjanya
<div n="lb">(Arvāgvasu) with Urvaśī and Pūrvachitti ({%comm.:%} in the
<div n="lb">two months of Hemanta or the cold season).--This latter
<div n="lb">idea becomes then more systematized in the {%Purāṇas,%} when
<div n="lb">a description is given of the Genii that attend the chariot
<div n="lb">of the Sun in its yearly course; thus the {%Bhāgavata P.%}
<div n="lb">mentions that besides the Ṛṣis, Gandharvas &c. also one
<div n="lb">Gaṇa or troupe of Apsarasas pays adoration to the Sun every
<div n="lb">month; and the {%Viṣṇu P.,%} that among the Genii who pre-
<div n="lb">side each in every month over the chariot of the Sun, Kra-
<div n="lb">tusthalā performs this function in the month Madhu, Punji-
<div n="lb">kasthalā in the month Mādhava, Menā in Śuchi, Sahajanyā
<div n="lb">in Śukra, Pramlochā in Nabhas, Anumlochā in Bhādra-
<div n="lb">pada, Ghṛtachī in Āsvina, Visvāchī in Kārttika, Urvaśī
<div n="lb">in Agrahāyaṇa, Pūrvachitti in Pausha, Tilottamā in Māgha,
<div n="lb">Rambhā in Phālguna; an analogous description is given in
<div n="lb">the {%Vāyu P.%} with the only difference that Viprachitti takes
<div n="lb">the place of Pūrvachitti, apparently with less correctness,
<div n="lb">as this account is a strict developement of the quoted pas-
<div n="lb">sage of the Yajurveda ({%Vājas.%} 15. 15-19.). In the last my-
<div n="lb">thological epoch when the Gandharvas have saved from
<div n="lb">their elementary nature merely so much as to be the musi-
<div n="lb">cians in the paradise of Indra, the Apsarasas appear amongst
<div n="lb">other subordinate deities which share in the merry life of
<div n="lb">Indra's heaven, as the wives of the Gandharvas, but more
<div n="lb">especially as wives of a licentious sort, and they are pro-
<div n="lb">mised therefore, too, as a reward to heroes fallen in battle
<div n="lb">when they are received in the paradise of Indra; and while,
<div n="lb">in the Ṛgveda, they assist Soma to pour down his floods,
<div n="lb">they descend in the epic literature on earth merely to shake
<div n="lb">the virtue of penitent Sages and to deprive them of the
<div n="lb">power they would have otherwise acquired through un-
<div n="lb">broken austerities.--To this association of the ethical with
<div n="lb">the physical element in the character of the Apsarasas
<div n="lb">belongs also that view expressed by {%Manu,%} according to
<div n="lb">which the Soul in its transmigrations is reborn as Apsaras
<div n="lb">when it was in its previous existence under the influence of
<div n="lb">rajas or passion; and probably too the circumstance, that in
<div n="lb">the {%Atharvaveda%} they are fond of dice, and three Apsarasas,
<div n="lb">whose names are given above, are supposed to have the
<div n="lb">power of removing faults committed at gambling with dice.
[Page224-a+ 56]
<div n="P">The word occurs also in the form {#अप्सरा,#} and may be
<div n="lb">written, besides, {#अप्स्सरस्#} accord. to {%Kātyāyana,%} or {#अफ्सरस्#}
<div n="lb">accord. to {%Pauṣkarasādi;%} (these latter forms however are not
<div n="lb">varieties of the form {#अप्सरस्,#} but the consequence of general
<div n="lb">Sandhi rules; the first is given as an instance by {%Patanjali,%}
<div n="lb">the latter by the {%Kāśikā%}). E. {#अप्#} and {#सरस्#} ({#सृ,#} uṇ. aff.
<div n="lb">{#असि#}), {%liter.%} ‘coming from the waters’ ({%Rāyam.:%} {#वारुणप्र-#}
<div n="lb">{#धानत्वादद्भ्यः सृता इत्यप्सरसः#}); this is the most probable
<div n="lb">E.; it is given also by {%Yāska%} who mentions besides an im-
<div n="lb">probable one by {%Śākapūṇi,%} viz. from {#अप्सस्#} ‘form, beauty’
<div n="lb">which he completes by adding the latter part of the comp.,
<div n="lb">{#रस्#} (from {#रा#}), when the word would mean according to
<div n="lb">him, ‘a woman endowed with beauty ({#रूपवती#})’ or ‘one
<div n="lb">by whom beauty is taken ({#तद्#}--scil. {#रूपम्--अनयात्तम्#})’
<div n="lb">or ‘one to whom beauty is given ({#तदस्यै दत्तम्#})’; a similar
<div n="lb">E. is intended by the passage of the {%Śatapath.%} (IX. 4. 1. 4.):
<div n="lb">{#गन्धर्वाप्सरसो हि भूत्वोदक्रामन्नथो गन्धेन च वै रूपेण च ग-#}
<div n="lb">{#न्धर्वाप्सरसश्चरन्ति,#} on which the comm. of {%Sāyaṇa%} runs
<div n="lb">thus (E. I. H. 149): {#गन्धेन च#} (Ms. {#चा#} sic) {#वै रूपेण#}
<div n="lb">(Ms. {#वै श्च रूपेण#} sic) {#च गन्धर्वाप्सरसश्चरन्तीत्यनेन#} (Ms. {#ग-#}
<div n="lb">{#न्धर्वोप्स°°#} sic) {#गन्धर्वशब्दोऽप्सरःशब्दश्च निरुच्यते । गन्धेन#}
<div n="lb">{#विशन्तीति#} (Ms. {#गन्धोन विशिन्तीति#} sic) {#गन्धर्वाः । अप्सशब्देन#}
<div n="lb">(Ms. {#अप्रशब्देन#} sic) {#रूपमभिधीयते । तेन विशिष्टाश्चरन्तीति#}
<div n="lb">{#अप्सरसः । गन्धर्वाप्सरसः । गन्धर्वाप्सरःशब्दयोः पृषोदरादि-#}
<div n="lb">{#त्वात्#} ({%Pāṇ.%} VI. 3. 109.) {#वर्णागमादिति विधानेनोक्त एवार्थे#}
<div n="lb">{#साधुत्वं द्रष्टव्यम्,#} when the word would literally mean: ‘go-
<div n="lb">ing (distinguished) with beauty’; (comp. the quotation of
<div n="lb">{%Patanj.%} on {%Pāṇ.%} V. 2. 95: {#उर्वशी वै रूपिण्यप्सरसाम्#}), but
<div n="lb">this kind of popular E. of the word is as little plausible as
<div n="lb">that given by the {%Rāmāyaṇa,%} according to which these deities
<div n="lb">would derive their name from the circumstance that they
<div n="lb">arose from the essence ({#रस#}) which was obtained from the
<div n="lb">churning ‘in the waters’ ({#अप्सु#}) of the ocean.
