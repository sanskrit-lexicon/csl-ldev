to Agni every evening at sunset and to Sūrya every morning
at sunrise; and 2. the kāmya, voluntary or the Agnihotra

the attainment of some specific object, as the Mṛtāgnihotra
or the Māsāgnihotra in the beginning of the Sattra Kun-
ḍapāyināmayana. <sup>2</sup> The same as {#अग्न्याधान#} q. v. E. {#अग्नि#}
