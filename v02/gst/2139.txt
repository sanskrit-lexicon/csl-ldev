{#अध्वर#}¦ Bahuvr. I. m. f. n. ({#-रः-रा-रम्#}) <sup>1</sup> Not crooked,
<div n="lb">honest proper (ved.) <sup>2</sup> Not perishable, lasting (in its con-
<div n="lb">sequences, as a sacrifice; ved.). <sup>3</sup> Intent, attentive. (It is
<div n="lb">doubtful whether this word in the two meanings ‘not crook-
<div n="lb">ed’ and ‘not perishable’, occurs in the femin. gender, as
<div n="lb">it is used in the Vedas either absolutely as a neuter or as
<div n="lb">epithet of {#यज्ञ#} in the mascul. Nor is the latter meaning
<div n="lb">‘intent, attentive’, a usual one, though it is given in
<div n="lb">several of the native dictionaries.)
<div n="P">II. m. ({#-रः#}) <sup>1</sup> Sacrifice in general, but in the ritual works
<div n="lb">mostly used as the denomination of the greater sacrifices
<div n="lb">or those performed with the juice of the Soma plant; see
<div n="lb">also {#सौम्याध्वर#} and {#अध्वरकाण्ड#}. <sup>2</sup> The name of a Vasu
<div n="lb">(q. v.). <sup>3</sup> The proper name of the chief of a renowned fa-
<div n="lb">mily. See {#आध्वरायण#}.
<div n="P">III. n. ({#-रम्#}) Sky, atmosphere (ved.). E. {#अ#} priv. and
<div n="lb">{#ध्वर#} ‘having no crookedness, dishonesty &c.’ or according
<div n="lb">to others ‘preventing, not allowing of injury’; another
<div n="lb">etym. makes this word, but erroneously, a Tatpur. from
<div n="lb">{#अध्वन्#} and {#र#} ‘giving or affording the road (scil. to heaven)’.
