{#अनुत्पत्तिसम#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-मः-मा#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
The sophism of the impossibility of origin or birth; viz.
arguing that a thing cannot take origin, because a thing
exists in consequence of an immaterial cause; as the latter,
however, does not exist before the material cause and the
instance proving the existence of such material cause, and
as the material cause again depends upon what exists, and
the instance upon the material cause, the thing itself can
never come into existence: or origin in general is impossible.
E. {#अनुत्पत्ति#} and {#सम#}. (With respect to the gender of this
word and the ellipsis required to explain it, see the E. of
{#अनित्यसम#}.)
