{#अन्तदीपक#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-कम्#}) (In Rhetoric.) One of the
alaṅkāras or modes of writing or speaking elegantly, a
variety of the alaṅkāra {#दीपक#} q. v.; viz. when a variegated
description reposes on, and is illustrated as it were by, a
verb which is placed at the end of the sentence. (It would
seem that the injunction of the principal rhetorical works
according to which there must be several verbs and but
one subject in a {#दीपक#} has not been considered as absolute,
as results from this instance: {#स गिरिं तरुषण्डमण्डितं#}
{#समवाप्य त्वरया लतामृगः । स्मितदर्शितकार्यनिश्चयः कपिसै-#}
{#न्यैर्मुदितैरमण्डयत्#} where there is but one verb viz. {#अमण्ड-#}
{#यत्#} which has the properties required in this {#दीपक#}. Com-
pare also {#आदिदीपक, मध्यदीपक, प्रतीपदीपक#} and {#मालादी-#}
{#पक#}.) E. {#अन्त#} and {#दीपक#}.
