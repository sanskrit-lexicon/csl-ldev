{#अपिकक्ष्य#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-क्ष्यम्#}) (ved.) A ligature or bandage
<div n="lb">for rejoining with the {#कक्ष#} (which word seems to mean in
<div n="lb">this case, {%shoulder%}) scil. the head. This word occurs in
<div n="lb">the {%Ṛgv.%} I. 117. 22., where the mystic science given by Da-
<div n="lb">dhyach to the Aśvins as a reward for having replaced his
<div n="lb">head, when it was cut off, with a horse's head, is called
<div n="lb">or likened to, a bandage, because, as {%Sāyaṇa%} interprets,
<div n="lb">it became the means by which the cut-off head was rejoined
<div n="lb">with the shoulder part. E. {#अपि#} and {#कक्ष्य#}.
