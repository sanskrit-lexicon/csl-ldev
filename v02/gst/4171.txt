{#अन्नायु#}¦ m. ({#-युः#}) I. Tatpur. Seizing food (see {#अन्न#} 2. 2.); or
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. Living through food (see {#अन्न#} 2. 2.); an epithet
of the vital air {#अपान#} q. v., in the Aitareya Upanishad,
because it alone was capable to seize the primitive food,
created from the waters by the Supreme Soul, after speech,
the vital air {#प्राण#} q. v., eye, ear, skin (i. e. touch), manas and
the generative organ were unable to take possession of, and
thus of preserving, life through it. In the passage alluded
to there is a quibble on the word {#आयु,#} according to its
having the sense of ‘obtaining’ from the corresponding
meaning of the rad. {#ई, वी,#} or the sense of {#आयुस्#} ‘life’;
as the word occurs in the nomin. {#अन्नायुः,#} it may, as a
Bahuvr., represent also the form {#अन्नायुस्#}. The radical {#ई#}
having the same meaning as {#वी#} and probably being identical
with it in origin, the words {#वयत्#} and {#वायु#} ‘air or taking’,
in the same passage, complete the double sense of the pun:
‘{#तद्#} (i. e. {#अन्नं#}) {#अपानेनाजिघृक्षत्तदा वयत् । स एषोऽन्नस्य#}
{#ग्रहो#} (comm. = {#अन्नग्राहकः#}) {#यद्वायुरन्नायुर्वा एष यद्वायुः;#}
comm.: {#यो वायुरन्नायुरन्नबन्धनोऽन्नजीवनो वै प्रसिद्धं स एष#}
{#यो वायुः#}. E. {#अन्न#} and {#आयु#}.
