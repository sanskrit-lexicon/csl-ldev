{#अपेहिस्वागता#}¦ Bahuvr. f. ({#-सा#}) A festival or ceremony
where undesired or uninvited people are denied admission.
See the explanation s. v. {#अपेहिवाणिजा#}. (This meaning is
hypothetical; but as all the similar formations mentioned
in the last named article imply the shutting out of un-
desired objects, it will seem that {#स्वागत#} is either to be taken
in this compound as {#सु-आगत#} ‘welcome’ in an ironical
sense--comp. e. g. {#सत्य, साधु--,#} or as {#स्व-आगत#} ‘come
on one's own account, uninvited’.) E. {#अपेहि#} (imper. of {#इ#}
with {#अप#}) and {#स्वागत,#} scil. {#क्रिया#}.
