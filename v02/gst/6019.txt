{#अभिधर्म#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-र्मः#}) (In Buddhistic doctrine.) The mani-

<div n="lb">{%Burnouf'%}s {%Introd.%} p. 40: = {#अभिमुखो धर्मः;#} therefore not to be
<div n="lb">rendered: the ‘supreme law’; {#धर्म#} has been translated here
<div n="lb">‘truth’, instead of ‘law’, in conformity with the judicious
<div n="lb">remark of {%Spence Hardy, East. Mon.%} p. 167); i. e. the Bud-
<div n="lb">dhistic dogmas and metaphysics, as laid down in the {#अ-#}
<div n="lb">{#भिधर्मपिटक#} q. v.--The first redaction of the Abhidharma
<div n="lb">is ascribed to {%Kāśyapa%} or {%Mahā-Kaśyapa,%} the principal
<div n="lb">disciple of {%Śākya Muni;%} but the redaction of the whole col-
<div n="lb">lection of works on this subject seems to belong to different
<div n="lb">periods the last of which precedes the third Buddhistic
<div n="lb">synod; (see {%Lassen'%}s {%Ind. Alt.%} vol. II. p. 458). {%Hodgson%} re-
<div n="lb">lates of four great {%Nepalese%} schools divided on account of
<div n="lb">their views on the Abhidharma: the {%Svābhāvika, Aiśvarika,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kārmika%} and {%Yātnika%} (see {%Burnouf'%}s {%Introd.%} p. 441 and the
<div n="lb">quotation given there); {%Csoma de Körös%} speaks of four
<div n="lb">other {%Tibetian%} schools which are divided and subdivided
<div n="lb">into various sects: 1. the {%Vaibhāṣikās%} which comprise four
<div n="lb">sects: {%a.%} one founded by {%Rāhula,%} the son of Śākya, and
<div n="lb">subdivided at the period of the third synod into seven sects:
<div n="lb">the Mūla-sarvāsti-vādās, Kāśyapīyās, Mahīśāsakās, Dhar-
<div n="lb">maguptās, Bahuśrutīyās, Tāmraśātīyās and Vibhādyavā-
<div n="lb">dinas; {%b.%} one founded by {%Kāśyapa,%} a Brāhmaṇa, and sub-
<div n="lb">divided into six sects, five of which, bearing the collective
<div n="lb">name of Mahāsaṅghikās, were known at the time of the
<div n="lb">third synod: the Pūrvaśailās, Avaraśailās, Haimavatās,
<div n="lb">Lokottaravādinas and Prajnaptivādinas; {%c.%} one founded by
<div n="lb">{%Upāli,%} a Śūdra, and having the surname Sammatās, sub-
<div n="lb">divided into three sects: the Kaurmakullakās (?), Āvan-
<div n="lb">tikās and Vātsīputrīyās; {%d.%} one founded by {%Kātyāyana,%} a
<div n="lb">Śūdra, and subdivided also into three sects: the Mahāvi-
<div n="lb">hāravāsinas, Jyetavanīyās and Abhayagirivāsinas; 2. the
<div n="lb">{%Sautrāntikās%} with two sects; 3. the {%Yogāchārās,%} founded by
<div n="lb">{%Āryasaṅgha%} and divided into nine sects; 4. the {%Mādhyami-%}
<div n="lb">{%kās%} owing their origin to {%Nāgārjuna%} who lived about 400
<div n="lb">years after the Buddha, divided into two sects the founders
<div n="lb">of which are probably {%Āryadeva%} and {%Buddhapālita.%} (For
<div n="lb">these sects and the doctrine itself see {%Burnouf'%}s {%Introd.%}
<div n="lb">p. 437 ff., {%Lassen'%}s {%Ind. Alt.%} II. p. 456 ff.; also {%Spence Hardy'%}s
<div n="lb">{%East. Mon.%} where a legend, related p. 197, conveys an idea
<div n="lb">of the great merit supposed to be acquired by the study of
