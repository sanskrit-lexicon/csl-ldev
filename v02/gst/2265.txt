{#अनन्तरज#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-जः#}) The son of a man of the three
first castes, married to a woman of a caste inferior in order
[Page068-b+ 56]
to his own, but not to a Sūdra woman viz. of a Brāhmaṇa
by a Kṣatriyā or Vaiśyā and of a Kṣatriyā by a Vaiśyā.
The three kinds of sons got by parents of the same caste
are called {#सजातिज#} and both, comprising six kinds, have
the privileges of a Dvija or twice-born man. (This is
the explanation given by a commentator of Manu and,
according to him, {#अनन्तरज#} would have a different mean-
ing than {#अनन्तरजात,#} though both words appear to be
synonymes.) E. {#अनन्तर#} and {#ज#}.
