{#अपरवत्#}¦ ind. Like what is after or follows; in the instance
{#तदेतद्ब्रह्मापूर्वमपरवत्#} with the meaning ‘like the world’:
‘that Brahman has nothing before itself (i. e. it is without
a cause) and it is like what is after it (viz. the world)’.--
[In this passage of the Sātap. X. 3. 5. 11. {#अपरवत्#} is indecl.,
for it has the accent on the last syllable; if it were the
neuter of an inflected word, formed with {#मतुप्,#} it would
be udātta on the first syllable.] E. {#अपर,#} taddh. aff. {#वति#}.
