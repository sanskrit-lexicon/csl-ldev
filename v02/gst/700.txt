{#अङ्गिरस्#}¦ I. m. sing. ({#-राः#}) The proper name of a Maharshi,
a great Ṛṣi or saint who is the reputed author of many
vaidik hymns, but who is mentioned also in a subse-
[Page020-a+ 56]
quent period as one of the inspired legislators of India
and as the author of an astronomical work. The various
legends connected with his life seem to have been occasioned
by the word {#अङ्गिरस्#} coming from the same radical as,
and its sound recalling that of, {#अग्नि,#} fire (q. v.). Hence
we find Angiras sometimes either as an epithet or as the
father of Agni, and the Saint himself connected chiefly with
such hymns as are addressed to Agni, to Indra or to dei-
ties of a kindred description: a portion of the fourth Veda,
the Atharvan, reports him also as an expounder of the
Brahmavidyā (q. v.) or the sacred knowledge, that had been
imparted to him by Satyavāha, a descendant of Bharadvāja.
(See {#अङ्गिर्#}.) Though Angiras, as may be concluded from his
name being connected with the authorship of a great por-
tion of the sacred Hindu literature, appears to have been
one of the oldest civilizers of India, no historical date is
to be obtained from the epic or pauranik literature where
the vaidik legends of his life are merely amplified; there
he is named as one of the Prajāpatis or progenitors of
mankind engendered, according to some by Manu, accord-
ing to others by Brahmā himself, either with the female
half of his body or from his mouth or from the space
between his eye-brows. As such he is considered also as
one of the seven Ṛṣis who preside over the reign of the
first Manu or Svāyambhuva. He is called, besides, the priest
of the Gods, the Lord of the sacrifice &c. Sometimes he
is considered as a son of Uru by Āgneyī, the daughter of
Agni. His daughters are the Ṛchas (or vaidik hymns) and
also, Śaśvatī, Sinīvālī, Kuhū, Rākā, Anumati; his sons
are Samvarta, the manes called Havishmats, Utathya,
Bṛhaspati, Mārkanḍeya; his wives, Smṛti (traditional
science), two daughters of Daksha, Svadhā and Satī, and
Śraddhā, the daughter of the sage Kardama. As an astro-
nomical personification he is Bṛhaspati himself or the regent
of the planet Jupiter and presides over the sixth year of
the cycle of sixty years. See also {#अथर्वन्#}.
<div n="P">II. m. pl. ({#-रसः#}) <sup>1</sup> The descendants of the former. In this
capacity they share also in the nature of the legends attri-
buted to Angiras. Angiras being the father of Agni, they
are considered as descendants of Agni himself, who is also
called the first of the Angirasas. Like Angiras, they occur
in hymns addressed to the luminous deities and, at a later
period, they become for the most part personifications of
light, of luminous bodies, of divisions of time, of celestial
phenomena and fires adapted to peculiar occasions as the
full and change of the moon, or to particular rites as the
Aśvamedha, Rājasūya, the Pākayajnas or sacrifices with
food, obsequial and funeral fires, expiatory fires, and the
like. Most of the authors of the hymns of the Rigveda are
connected with them and in the Purāṇas mention is made of
two tribes of the Angirasas which were Brāhmaṇas as well
as Kshatriyas. <sup>2</sup> The hymns of the Atharvaveda. See also
{#अथर्वन्#} pl. and {#अथर्वाङ्गिरस्#} pl. E. {#अङ्ग्,#} uṇ. aff. {#असि#} with
āgama {#इरुट्,#} or, according to another authority, a Tatpur.
composed of {#अन्#} (meaning {#अन्न#} food, from {#अन्#} kṛt aff. {#क्विप्#})
and {#गिरस्#} (from {#गॄ#} to swallow) ‘devouring food’. The latter
[Page020-b+ 56]
etymology, apparently without any grammatical authority,
would refer especially to {#अङ्गिरस्#} as epithet of Agni. See
also {#अङ्गिरस्तम#}. The plural {#अङ्गिरसः#} is considered, though
without any etymological necessity, as the plural of the
deriv. form {#आङ्गिरस#} with luk or elision of the affix.
