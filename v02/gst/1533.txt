{#अत्रि#}¦ m. ({#-त्रिः#}) <sup>1</sup> Eater, devourer (in the Vedas especially as
<div n="lb">an epithet of Agni, the divinity of fire). <sup>2</sup> The name of a
<div n="lb">Maharshi or a great Saint, who in the Vedas occurs especi-
<div n="lb">ally in hymns composed for the praise of Agni, Indra, the
<div n="lb">Aśvins and the Viśvadevas; and who in the epic period
<div n="lb">is considered as one of the ten Prajāpatis or lords of crea-
<div n="lb">tion engendered by Manu for the purpose of creating the
<div n="lb">universe; at a later period he appears as a mindborn son
<div n="lb">of Brahmā and as one of the seven Ṛṣis who preside
<div n="lb">over the reign of Svāyambhuva, the first, or according to
<div n="lb">others of Svārochiṣa, the second, or of Vaivaswata, the
<div n="lb">seventh Manu; he is married to Anasūyā, the daughter of
<div n="lb">Daksha and their son is Durvāsas. Produced by a flash of
<div n="lb">light from his eye which was received by Space, the via
<div n="lb">lactea personified, or according to a more recent legend,
<div n="lb">by his penitence, is Soma or the moon. See {#अत्रिजात,#}
<div n="lb">{#अत्रिदृग्ज, अत्रिनेत्रज#} &c. As sons of his are also named
<div n="lb">the Manes Barhishads and Udamaya; a daughter of his is
<div n="lb">Apālā. The name of Atri occurs also as that of the author
<div n="lb">of several vaidik hymns, as that of an inspired legislator,
<div n="lb">of the author of an astronomical and medical work and,
<div n="lb">in astronomy, as one of the seven Ṛṣis in the constel-
<div n="lb">lation of the great bear.--An Atri, son of Sāṅkhya, but
<div n="lb">probably a different personage, is the author of a hymn in
<div n="lb">the Ṛgveda.--Amongst the authors of vaidik hymns we
<div n="lb">find as sons or descendants of Atri the following: Archa-
<div n="lb">nāna, Avasyu, Bāhuvṛkta, Bhauma, Budha, Dvita, Ga-
<div n="lb">viṣṭhira, Gaya, Gopavana, Isha, Paura, Pratibhānu, Pra-

<div n="lb">pl. ({#अत्रयः#}) The descendants (see {#गोत्र#}) of Atri collectively.
<div n="lb">(The masc. plur. {#अत्रयः#} is considered as the plur. of the
<div n="lb">patronymic {#आत्रेय#} (q. v.) with luk of the taddh. aff. {#ढक्;#}
<div n="lb">the plural of the fem., however, remaining regular, viz.
<div n="lb">{#आत्रेय्यः;#} but there is no necessity to adopt this artificial
<div n="lb">etymology which is given to connect the sense of the pa-
<div n="lb">tronymic with that of the plur. of the original form.) E.
