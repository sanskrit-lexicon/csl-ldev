{#अनुत्तरोपपातिक#}¦ m. pl. ({#-काः#}) Apparently the same as {#अनुत्तर#}
m. pl.: the name of the Jaina gods so called. According
to a commentary it would mean literally ‘those who have
the highest origin i. e. who are born in the five Vimānas’
from which the five classes of the {#अनुत्तराः#} derive their
appellations. E. {#अनुत्तरोपपातिन्#} ({#अनुत्तर#} and {#उपपात,#}
taddh. aff. {#इनि#}), taddh. aff. {#कन्(?)#}.
