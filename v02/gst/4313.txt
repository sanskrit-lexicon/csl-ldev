{#अन्यस्त्री#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-स्त्री#}) A woman not one's own. [In
Rhetoric she is one of the three categories of the principal
female character in a poetical composition (the two other
being {#स्वस्त्री#} or {#स्वीया#} and {#साधारणस्त्री#} or {#सामान्यनायिका#}
qq. vv.; the {#अन्यस्त्री#} or {#परकीया#} is either ‘another's wife’
or a ‘damsel’; as ‘another's wife’ ‘she is fond of festivals
and the like opportunities, is a disgrace to her family, bare
of modesty’; the ‘damsel’ is ‘one not yet married, bashful
and arrived at the period of youth’. Each of these two
has again eight subdivisions; ‘she may be one who has an
obsequious lover, or one who is ill-treated, or one who
goes after her lover, or one who is separated from him by a
quarrel, or one who is neglected, or one whose lover is abroad,
or one who is prepared in her house to receive him, or one
who is longing in absence of her lover’). E. {#अन्य#} and {#स्त्री#}.
