{#अभिन्यास#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-सः#}) (Literally: Combination, mix-
ture; esp. in Medicine.) A variety of fever, viz. a mixed
remittent or synochus fever, supposed to be produced by
the morbid state of the three temperamental elements, air,
bile and phlegm collectively; the patient is described by
{%Suśruta%} as ‘being neither too warm nor too cold, not quite
conscious, wandering in his mind, hoarse, with a sharp
taste, dry throat, void of perspiration and not having the
natural excretions, hiccupping, without appetite, dull, pant-
ing (or sighing), lying prostrate, impeded in speech, drowsy
and with contracted limbs’; the cure of this fever is believed
either very difficult or impossible. It is also called {#हतौजस्,#}
as the patient looses his strength by this fever, or from the
‘combination’ of the causes which produce it, {#सन्निपातज्वर,#}
{#सर्वात्मकज्वर, सर्वदोषसमुत्थज्वर, सर्वजज्वर, सर्वज्वर#}. E.
{#अस्#} (cl. 4.) with {#नि#} and {#अभि,#} kṛt aff. {#घञ्;#} scil. {#ज्वर#}.
