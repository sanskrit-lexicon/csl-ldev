{#अपसिद्धान्त#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-न्तः#}) <sup>1</sup> A false conclusion; e. g. {#मूर्त-#}
{#त्वाद्घटादिवत्समानधर्मापत्तावपसिद्धान्तः#} ‘(to say that the
Soul is limited) is a false conclusion, for this would lead
to assert that, from its having shape, it shares in the
properties of material substances (as in those of perishable-
ness &c.)’; or {#आनन्दाभिव्यक्तिर्मुख्यमोक्ष इति नवीनवेदान्ति-#}
{#नामपसिद्धान्त एवेति धिक्#} ‘to maintain that manifestation of
happiness is real liberation is a wrong conclusion of the
modern Vedāntists: shame (on such twaddle)’. <sup>2</sup> (In the
Nyāya philosophy.) Logical inconsistency in argumentation,
viz. arguing so as to come in contradiction with the tenets
of one's own school; one of the twenty two {#निग्रहस्थान#}
or failures in discussion which lead to the defeat of the
disputant; more especially it is thus defined: {#सिद्धान्तमभ्यु-#}
{#पेत्यानियमात्कथाप्रसङ्गोऽपसिद्धान्तः#} ‘{%apasiddhānta%} is ar-
gumentation without regard to the definitions contained in
the tenets of a school which one has adopted as his own’.--
The commentator adds however that there is no {#अपसिद्धान्त#}
or inconsistency of this kind, if one differs merely in a
special topic from the authority of his school: {#यस्त्वेकदे-#}
{#शिमतेन कथामारभते तस्य शास्त्रकाराभ्युपगमविरोधे नापसि-#}
{#द्धान्तः;#} ‘the Saugatas’, he says, ‘do not consider logical
inconsistency as a defect, but that is another question’ ({#सौ-#}
{#गतास्त्वपसिद्धान्तं दूषणं न मन्यन्त इत्यन्यदेतत्#}). E. {#अप#} and
{#सिद्धान्त#}.
