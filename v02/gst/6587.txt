{#अभीर#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. ({#-रः#}) A cowherd. ‘According to
<div n="lb">Manu (X. 15.) the {%Abhīra%} is of mixed origin, the offspring
<div n="lb">of a Brāhmaṇa father and a mother of the Ambashtha or
<div n="lb">medical caste; but the {%Abhīras%} were a people, a pastoral
<div n="lb">tribe, settled about the beginning of the Christian era, on
<div n="lb">or near the lower course of the Indus on a tract known to
<div n="lb">classical geographers, as the {%Abiria%} of Ptolemy, lying north
<div n="lb">of the Sahyadri mountain and of Syrastrene. The {%Abhīras%}
<div n="lb">of Saurāṣtra are mentioned in the Mahābhārata. From
<div n="lb">their pastoral habits the name came to be generally applied
<div n="lb">to the cowherds of Hindustan. In the spoken dialects of
<div n="lb">upper India the word is corrupted to Ahīr, Uheer; in Ben-
<div n="lb">gālī and Marāṭhī it is unchanged, occurring as Abhīr.’

<div n="lb">547. 553. 592. 792. 855. 953. 956. &c.--The word as a
<div n="lb">name of a people occurs in the Purāṇas ‘always conjoined
<div n="lb">with the {%Śūdras,%} as if conterminous’ ({%Wilson'%}s {%Viṣṇu-P.%}
<div n="lb">p. 195 n. 154).--The {%Sāhityadarpaṇa%} mentions the {%Abhīras%}
<div n="lb">as assistants appointed in, or belonging to, the harem
<div n="lb">(together with dwarfs, eunuchs, Kirātas or mountaineers,

<div n="lb">same work, in defining the purposes for which Sanskṛt
<div n="lb">and the Prākṛt-dialects are used in the dramatic dialogue,
<div n="lb">appropriates the dialect of the Abhīras (which therefore is
<div n="lb">not considered by the {%Sāh.%} as an Apabhranśa-dialect) to
<div n="lb">cowherds and woodcutters; comp. {#आभीरी#} s. v. {#आभीर;#}
<div n="lb">{#(आभीरेषु तथाभीरी…। आभीरी शावरी चापि काष्ठ-#}
<div n="lb">{#पत्त्रोपजीविषु);#} others hold the Abhīra-dialect as belonging
<div n="lb">to the Apabhranśa, when it would be excluded from dra-
<div n="lb">matic use. See {#अपभ्रंश#} and {%Lassen'%}s {%Institutiones Linguae%}

<div n="lb">four lines with eleven {%mātrās%} in each line (the value of a
