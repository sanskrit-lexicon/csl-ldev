{#अन्योन्यहस्तकलित#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-तः-ता-तम्#}) Held reci-
procally in (his several) hands. This word occurs in an
example of permutation, given in the Līlavatī, where the
[Page150-a+ 56]
question is put, ‘how many are the variations of form of
the god Śiva by the exchange of his ten attributes held reci-
procally in his hands viz. the rope, the elephant's hook &c.,
as those of Viṣṇu by the exchange of the mace &c.?’ (the
practical purpose apparently being to know the number of
variations that may be effected in the representation of the
idol): {#पाशाङ्कुशाहिडमरूककपालशूलैः । खट्वाङ्गशक्तिशरचा-#}
{#पयुतैर्भवन्ति । अन्योन्यहस्तकलितैः कति मूर्तिभेदाः शम्भोर्हरेरिव#}
{#गदारिसरोजशङ्खैः#} (The answer is in the case of Śiva:
3628800; in that of Viṣṇu: 24; and Colebrooke adds (Alg.
p. 124 note): ‘the 24 different representations of Viṣṇu,
arising from his diversity in the manner of placing the
weapons or attributes in his four hands, are distinguished
by as many discriminative titles of the god allotted to those
figures in the theogonies of the Purāṇas. It does not ap-
pear that distinct titles have been in like manner assigned
to any part of the more than three millions of varied re-
presentations of Śiva’.) E. {#अन्योन्य-हस्त#} and {#कलित#}.
