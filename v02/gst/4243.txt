{#अन्यथासिद्धि#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-द्धिः#}) I. (In the Vaiśeṣika philosophy.)
The being wrongly established or the establishing wrongly,
i. e. the being referred of an effect, or the referring an effect,
to a cause which is not the true cause. This may happen
in five ways, viz. <sup>a.</sup> by taking for cause what is prior to
the effect but only accidental to the real cause ({#‘सह तेन’#}),
as by taking a potter's stick for the cause of a jar; or
<sup>b.</sup> by taking for cause something inherent to what is ac-
cidental to the real cause ({#‘यस्य’#}), as by taking the shape
of a potter's stick for the cause of a jar; or <sup>c.</sup> by taking
for cause what is prior but is known to be the cause of
another effect ({#‘अन्यं प्रति’#}), as by taking æther for the cause
of a jar, æther being the known cause of sound; or <sup>d.</sup> by
taking for cause what is prior but prior in so far only as
the real cause is produced by it ({#‘जनकं प्रति’#}), as by tak-
ing the potter's father for the cause of a jar; or <sup>e.</sup> by taking
for cause any thing foreign to the effect ({#‘अतिरिक्तम्’#}), as
by taking the donkey carrying the earth of which the jar is
made, for the cause of the jar. The last error comprises,
indeed, in its generality all the preceding and is therefore
called {#‘आवश्यक’,#} the absolute error. E. {#अन्यथा#} and {#सिद्धि#}.
<div n="P">II. Not being established or proved otherwise; in the Sān-
khya Sūtra: {#उभयत्राप्यन्यथासिद्धेर्न प्रत्यक्षमनुमानं वा#} (comm.
{#उभयत्रापि वैशिष्ट्यप्रत्यक्षे तदनुमाने च स्वरूपेणैवान्यथासिद्धेर्न#}
{#तदुभयं समवाये प्रमाणमित्यर्थः । अयं भावः । यथा समवायवै-#}
{#शिष्ट्यबुद्धिरपि गुणादिस्वरूपेणैवेष्यताम् । अतस्तत्रापि प्रत्यक्षा-#}
{#नुमानेऽन्यथासिद्धे#} &c.). E. {#अन्यथा#} and {#असिद्धि#}.
