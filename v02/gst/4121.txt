{#अन्नप्राशन#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-नम्#}) Giving food to eat, scil. to a
[Page135-a+ 56]
child: the seventh of the ten essential rites enjoined to the
the three first castes (see {#संस्कार#}); it ought to take place
according to Āsvālāyana, Manu, Yājnavalkya &c. in the
sixth month after a child's birth; according to Kātyāyana
and his school in the sixth (or, according to some, in the
eighth month) if the child is a boy, in the fifth or seventh,
if it is a girl. According to Āsvālāyana a father, if he
desire plenty (for his child?) ought to give it a soup or
sauce made of goat's flesh ({#‘आजमन्नाद्यकामः’#}); if he de-
sire holiness, a soup or sauce made of the flesh of a fran-
coline patridge, called tittiri ({#‘तैत्तिरं ब्रह्मवर्चसकामः’#}); if
he desire strength, boiled rice sprinkled over with very
little clarified butter, but not fried in butter, as it would
then not be moist ({#‘घृतौदनं तेजस्कामः’#}) [The restriction
made by the comm. in his explanation of the word {#घृतौदन#}
is not justified by himself, but countenanced by the gloss of
Patanjali on a Vārttika ({#‘संप्रत्ययाच्च तदर्थाध्यवसानम्’#}) to
Pāṇini II. 1. 34]; or if he have no particular desire, boiled
rice mixed with curdled milk, honey and clarified butter
({#‘दधिमधुघृतमिश्रमन्नं प्राशयेत्’#}). [The word {#अन्न#} supplied
at {#आज#} and {#तैत्तिर#} is, as the comm. observes, not to be
taken there in its usual sense ‘boiled rice’ but in that of
soup or sauce, {#व्यञ्जन#}.] When giving the food, whatever
be its substance, the father speaks the verse: {#अन्नपतेऽन्नस्य#}
{#नो देह्यनमीवस्य शुष्मिणः#} &c. (Vājas. Sanh. 11. 83.), if the
child is a boy; if it is a girl, the ceremony is performed
without the recital of the mantra ({#‘आवृतैव कुमार्यै’#}).--
According to the school of Kātyāyana the food varies still
more according to the nature of the desires: that cor-
responding with the desire of eloquence is the flesh (pro-
bably the sauce made of the flesh of) a skylark ({#भरद्वाजी#});
with the desire of plenty, that of a partridge, called {#क-#}
{#पिञ्जल;#} with the desire of quickness that of a fish; with
the desire of long life that of the partridge called {#कृकणा;#}
with the desire of holiness that of the Śaralī bird ({#आटी#});
with the desire of all the advantages mentioned before that
of all these animals together; the dish must moreover in
general contain honey, clarified butter and bits of gold
(Reṇuka in his Gṛhyakārikā: {#‘मध्वाज्यकनकोपेतं सर्वं तद्युग-#}
{#पत्प्रभुः । मांसं तच्च भरद्वाज्या यदीच्छेद्वाक्प्रसारिताम् । का-#}
{#पिञ्जलं चेदन्नाद्यं मात्स्यं च जवनं यदि । आयुश्चेत्कृकणायाश्च#}
{#तदाट्याश्चेद्ब्रह्मवर्चसम् । सर्वं चेत्सर्वमांसानि सहान्नं प्राशयेच्छु-#}
{#भम्’#}); the ceremony is performed while a mantra is in-
audibly muttered and the child is sitting on the lap of its
mother before the divinity of the family; preparatory pro-
cedings are, according to Reṇuka, those connected with
the fixing of an auspicious day, the Ābhyudayika-śrāddha
(the same as the Vṛddhi-Śr.), austerities, as suspending
the breath, meditation on the divinity and oblations (āhutis)
with clarified butter while remembering the divine powers
of speech ({#वाच्#}), the vital airs {#प्राण#} and {#अपान,#} eye
({#चक्षुस्#}) and ear ({#श्रोत्र#}), lastly an oblation of {#चरु#} (q. v.)
to Agni ({#अग्निः स्विष्टकृत्#}).--According to Bhavadeva, as
quoted by Rādhākānta, the order of the procedings is:
fixing of an auspicious day, ablutions, performance of the
Vṛddhi-Śrāddha, collecting of the sacrificial fire, making
[Page135-b+ 56]
a heap of Kuśagrass(?) (acc. to Reṇuka: of fifty leaves of
this grass), then silently throwing into the fire a piece of
fuel smeared with clarified butter, of a span's length, then
the oblation (homa) which is accompanied with the three
sacred words bhūr, bhuvar and svar, then five oblations
(āhutis) with clarified butter, then the homa of the five vital
airs ({#प्राण#}), or instead of the two latter(?) the ceremony
practised in the north which begins with the Śāṭyāyana-
homa and ends with the hymn called Vāmadevya; these
procedings are followed by the essential rite of giving the
food and by, what is essential too, the presents to the of-
ficiating priest. (Comp. also {#अन्नभुक्ति#}.) E. {#अन्न#} and {#प्राशन#}.
