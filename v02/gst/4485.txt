{#अपकर्षसम#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-मः-मा#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
The sophism of the non-existence of qualities; viz. arguing,
that because two things have one quality not in common,
they will have none in common; e. g. sound and a jar being
both artificially produced are perishable; now the sophism
in question would consist in concluding: that because sound
has not the quality of shape, which belongs to jar, or because
a jar does not refer to the sense of hearing as sound does,
sound and jar are neither artificially produced nor perishable.
E. {#अपकर्ष#} and {#सम#}. (With respect to the gender of this word
and the ellipsis required to explain it, see the E. of {#अनित्यसम#}.)
