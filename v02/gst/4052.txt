{#अन्धकारप्रायश्चित्त#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-त्तम्#}) A penance mentioned in
the Varāha-Purāṇa, to atone for the offence of approaching,
in the dark, the image of Viṣṇu in his incarnation as a
boar, without a lamp and without the Śāstra; such an offence
degrading the offender and exposing him to becoming blind:
the penance consists in veiling the eyes during fifteen days,
taking only one meal on the following twentieth day and
one meal on each twelfth day of the half of a month, and
when the penitent is half dead in consequence of such diet,
sitting in the water and ultimately eating a dish of barley
and rice cooked in cow's urine. He is promised to be rid
then of his crime. Another reading of this word is {#अन्धका-#}
{#रस्पृष्टप्रायश्चित्त#}. E. {#अन्धकार#} and {#प्रायश्चित्त#}.
