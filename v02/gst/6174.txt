{#अभिभायतन#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-नम्#}) (In Buddhistic doctrine.) ‘The
basis of mastership or superiority’; {#अभिभायतनानि#} or the
(eight) bases of superiority are the (eight) mental accom-
plishments or superior powers of a man who by having
internally the {%idea of form,%} perceives externally <sup>1</sup> {%limited%} or
<sup>2</sup> {%illimited forms,%} either {%with agreeable%} or {%disagreeable colours,%}
by having internally the {%idea of absence of form%} perceives
externally <sup>3</sup> {%limited%} or <sup>4</sup> {%illimited forms,%} either, too, {%with%}
{%agreeable%} or {%disagreeable colours,%} and by having internally
the {%idea of absence of form%} perceives externally <sup>5</sup> {%dark-blue%}
{%forms with dark-blue colours, aspect or appearance, <sup>6</sup> yellow%}
{%forms with yellow colours, aspect or appearance, <sup>7</sup> red forms%}
{%with red colours, aspect or appearance,%} and <sup>8</sup> {%white forms%}
{%with white colours, aspect or appearance.%} See {%Burnouf's Lo-%}
{%tus de la bonne loi;%} append. XV. E. {#अभिभा#} 2. and {#आयतन;#}
({%Burnouf 1. c.%} considers the word as a {%Pāli%} form represent-
ing the Sanskṛt {#अभिभ्वायतन,#} i. e. {#अभिभु#} or {#अभिभू#} and
{#आयतन,#} and renders it accordingly ‘the place or region
of the {%conqueror%}’; but as {#अभिभा = अभिभूति#} or {#अभिभव#}
may also have the active meaning, it seems better to adopt
the given E. and to take the word as a pure Sanskṛt
compound, meaning ‘that on which victory rests’, and
similar in formation to the Buddh. {#रूपायतन#} or {#आकाशा-#}
{#नन्त्यायतन#}).
