ATIKĀYA¦. One of the sons of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Previous Birth.%} This is a story concerning the initial
<div n="lb"/>stage of the creation of the Universe. After completing
<div n="lb"/>the task of creation Brahmā, in his pride fell into a sleep.
<div n="lb"/>In order to slight Brahmā a little, Mahāviṣṇu produced
<div n="lb"/>two Rākṣasas called Madhu and Kaiṭabha from his ears.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing their terrible roar Brahmā woke up in fear and
<div n="lb"/>fled to Mahāviṣṇu seeking refuge. Viṣṇu called Madhu
<div n="lb"/>and Kaiṭabha and asked them what boon they
<div n="lb"/>would like to ask. They proudly replied that they would
<div n="lb"/>grant a boon to Viṣṇu. In that case Mahāviṣṇu wanted
<div n="lb"/>them to grant him leave to kill them. They answered:
<div n="lb"/>“We will not break our promise about granting the
<div n="lb"/>boon. But since our passion for fighting has not been
<div n="lb"/>abated, you must fulfil our eager desire.” Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>said: “I agree. But let my boon be carried out first.
<div n="lb"/>After that I shall see that your wish is properly fulfill-
<div n="lb"/>ed. After your death, one of you will be reborn under
<div n="lb"/>the name of Khara and the other under the name of
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya. In the Tretāyuga I shall kill Khara in single
<div n="lb"/>combat after allaying his passion for fighting. Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>who is the incarnation of Ananta will fight with
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya to his full satisfaction and kill him. Thus both
<div n="lb"/>of you will get Virakti and Mukti.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this, Mahāviṣṇu made the two asuras
<div n="lb"/>stand on each of his thighs and killed them with his
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana Cakra. They were born again as Khara and
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} There is a story about the birth of Atikāya
<div n="lb"/>in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa: After
<div n="lb"/>his victory over Kubera Rāvaṇa was returning in his
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpaka Vimāna. On his way he saw some beautiful
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva women playing in the valley of Mayūragiri.
<div n="lb"/>Their leader was Citrāṅgī, the wife of Citrāṅgada.
[Page073-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa seduced her and had a secret union with her. At
<div n="lb"/>once she became pregnant and gave birth to a dazzlingly
<div n="lb"/>bright baby. The mother handed over the child to
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa and returned to the world of the Gandharvas.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, in his paternal love, took the child into the
<div n="lb"/>Vimāna and proceeded. On the way, the Vimāna
<div n="lb"/>knocked against a mountain peak and the baby was
<div n="lb"/>thrown overboard and fell in the forest. Rāvaṇa stop-
<div n="lb"/>ped the Vimāna and made a search for the baby in the
<div n="lb"/>forest. He found the child without the slightest injury,
<div n="lb"/>smiling and lying on a flat rock in the deep woods. He
<div n="lb"/>failed in his attempt to take it up even though he used
<div n="lb"/>ten of his hands. The child began to grow steadily in
<div n="lb"/>size. Then he tried again to lift the baby up using all
<div n="lb"/>his twenty arms. The boy, who had by this time grown
<div n="lb"/>into enormous size, suddenly sprang up and getting in-
<div n="lb"/>to the Vimāna took his seat in it. Rāvaṇa gave him the
<div n="lb"/>name Atikāya. On his arrival in Laṅkā, he presented
<div n="lb"/>him as adopted son to the barren Dhanyamālā.
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya was brought up by Dhanyamālā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Boons.%} Atikāya went to Gokarṇa and did pe-
<div n="lb"/>nance to please Brahmā. Brahmā appeared, but being
<div n="lb"/>fully absorbed in Samādhi, Atikāya was not aware of
<div n="lb"/>his presence. Even his life-breath had been stopped.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, by his power, instilled life-breath into him and
<div n="lb"/>restored him to consciousness. He granted Atikāya all
<div n="lb"/>the boons he asked for. They were three in number.
<div n="lb"/>The first was the gift of Brahmāstra which could smash
<div n="lb"/>anyone. The second was the gift of an armour which
<div n="lb"/>was unassailable by anyone. The third was absence of
<div n="lb"/>thirst, desire and other cravings.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Education.%} Atikāya went to Kailāsa and received
<div n="lb"/>his education from Śiva. He learnt all the sciences,
<div n="lb"/>Arts, Śruti, Smṛti etc. from there. On the completion
<div n="lb"/>of his course he asked what Gurudakṣiṇā he should
<div n="lb"/>pay. Śiva made him promise that he would never
<div n="lb"/>practise Black magic. Pleased with him, Śiva awarded
<div n="lb"/>him the Pāśupatāstra.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Victory in Battle.%} Atikāya had an uncle, a Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>named Candra. Once he was defeated by Indra. It was
<div n="lb"/>at this time of chagrin that he came to know that
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya had reached Laṅkā with the Pāśupatāstra.
<div n="lb"/>Candra Rākṣasa ordered Atikāya to bring Indra as a
<div n="lb"/>captive. Atikāya went to Svarga (Heaven) and began
<div n="lb"/>a war with Indra. Mahāviṣṇu who came to help Indra
<div n="lb"/>used his Sudarśana cakra. Atikāya shot his Pāśu-
<div n="lb"/>patāstra. Knowing Atikāya's history well, Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>brought the battle to a close. Both parties accepted the
<div n="lb"/>position that Devendra had lost the battle and Atikāya
<div n="lb"/>had won.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Death.%} In the Rāmāyaṇa battle Atikāya fought
<div n="lb"/>on the side of Rāvaṇa. After a most terrible conflict,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa killed Atikāya. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
