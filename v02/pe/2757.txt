INDRADYUMNA VI¦. A king who lived in the Kṛta
yuga, and a devotee of Viṣṇu. He visited the Jagan-
nātha temple in Oḍra Deśa once to worship Lord
Jagannātha. The Lord was then hidden in the sand.
When the King, disappointed at this was about to
return, determined to fast unto death at Mount Nīla
when a celestial voice cried, “Thou shalt see Him”.
Afterwards the King performed a horse sacrifice and
built a magnificent Viṣṇu temple. Narasiṃhamūrti
brought by Nārada was installed in the temple.
During sleep the King had a darśana (sight) of Lord
Jagannātha. Also an astral voice directed him to cut
down the fragrant tree on the seashore and make
idols with it. Accordingly the king got idols of
Viṣṇu, Balarāma, Sudarśana and Subhadrā made and
installed them in the temple. (Skanda Purāṇa).
