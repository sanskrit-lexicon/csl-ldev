MOHINĪ¦. The female form of Mahāviṣṇu. Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Asuras quarrelled with each other over the right of
<div n="lb"/>partaking the Amṛta (nectar) obtained from the sea of
<div n="lb"/>Milk. At that time Mahāviṣṇu appeared before them
<div n="lb"/>in the guise of a beautiful maiden of maddening charm
<div n="lb"/>and the asuras were guilefully made to turn their
<div n="lb"/>attention on her for some time during which time the
<div n="lb"/>nectar was carried away by the Devas. The female form
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu was called Mohinī.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva fell in love with Mohinī and by the union of the
<div n="lb"/>two was born Śāstā. (See under Amṛtam). (8th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Bhāgavata).
