INDĪVARASENA¦. Son of Parityāgasena a King who
<div n="lb"/>ruled the city of Irāvatī. Parityāgasena had two
<div n="lb"/>queens—Adhikasaṃgamā and Kāvyālaṅkāra. As they
[Page318-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>had no children, the distressed King with his queens
<div n="lb"/>worshipped the goddess Durgā. Durgā gave the King
<div n="lb"/>two fruits. She blessed that the queens would bear
<div n="lb"/>children when they ate the fruits. Adhikasaṃgamā ate
<div n="lb"/>both the fruits without showing them to the other wife.
<div n="lb"/>Two sons were born to her. Indīvarasena was the elder
<div n="lb"/>son. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Ratnaprabhā laṃbaka, 8th
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga).
