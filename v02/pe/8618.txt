VṚKṢĀYURVEDA¦. The name Vṛkṣāyurveda is used for
<div n="lb"/>the conventional rules about planting trees near dwel-
<div n="lb"/>ling places. According to Vṛkṣāyurveda it is good to
<div n="lb"/>plant Itti (wave-leafed fig-tree) on the North side of
<div n="lb"/>the house. Ficus Indica (banyan) should be planted on
<div n="lb"/>the east. Mango tree on the south and Ficus Religiosa
<div n="lb"/>(banyan) on the west of the house. Thorny trees should
<div n="lb"/>grow up by themselves on the south side of the house.
<div n="lb"/>Garden should be close to the house. Svātī, Hasta,
<div n="lb"/>Rohiṇī, Śravaṇa and Mūla are considered to be good
<div n="lb"/>stars for planting trees. Stars good for taking trees,
<div n="lb"/>across river or in vehicle and to take down into ponds,
<div n="lb"/>are Hasta, Maghā, Ārdrā, Aśvinī, Puṣyam and Jyeṣṭhā.
<div n="lb"/>The stars mentioned above are good for planting Neem
<div n="lb"/>tree, Jonesia Asoca, Calophyllum, Mimosasirisha, Acacia
<div n="lb"/>Priyaṅgu, Syzygium, Mimusops and pomegranate tree.
<div n="lb"/>The distance between trees should be twenty rods. This
<div n="lb"/>distance is the best. Sixteen rods is medium. But it
<div n="lb"/>should never be less than twelve rods. If the tree does
<div n="lb"/>not bear fruit, the stem should be examined by cutting
<div n="lb"/>with a knife. Then mix powdered vermifuge seeds with
<div n="lb"/>ghee and smear it on the cut. Then water the tree. If
<div n="lb"/>fruits are destroyed before they ripen, mix the powders
[Page881-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>of horse-gram, black-gram, green-gram, barley and se-
<div n="lb"/>sam with ghee and smear the tree and water it. Water-
<div n="lb"/>ing the tree with water and ghee will make the tree
<div n="lb"/>flower and yield fruits quickly. Mix powdered dung of
<div n="lb"/>sheep, powdered Barley, sesam, and cow's flesh with
<div n="lb"/>water and keep it for seven days. Then water the tree
<div n="lb"/>with this water. This will make any tree yield more fruits
<div n="lb"/>and flowers. Watering the trees with fish-water will
<div n="lb"/>make them yield fruits more quickly. Mixture of Vermi-
<div n="lb"/>fuge seed, fish and rice is a good manure. This manure
<div n="lb"/>is a good remedy for all diseases of trees. (Agni Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 281).
