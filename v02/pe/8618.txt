VṚKṢĀYURVEDA¦. The name Vṛkṣāyurveda is used for
the conventional rules about planting trees near dwel-
ling places. According to Vṛkṣāyurveda it is good to
plant Itti (wave-leafed fig-tree) on the North side of
the house. Ficus Indica (banyan) should be planted on
the east. Mango tree on the south and Ficus Religiosa
(banyan) on the west of the house. Thorny trees should
grow up by themselves on the south side of the house.
Garden should be close to the house. Svātī, Hasta,
Rohiṇī, Śravaṇa and Mūla are considered to be good
stars for planting trees. Stars good for taking trees,
across river or in vehicle and to take down into ponds,
are Hasta, Maghā, Ārdrā, Aśvinī, Puṣyam and Jyeṣṭhā.
The stars mentioned above are good for planting Neem
tree, Jonesia Asoca, Calophyllum, Mimosasirisha, Acacia
Priyaṅgu, Syzygium, Mimusops and pomegranate tree.
The distance between trees should be twenty rods. This
distance is the best. Sixteen rods is medium. But it
should never be less than twelve rods. If the tree does
not bear fruit, the stem should be examined by cutting
with a knife. Then mix powdered vermifuge seeds with
ghee and smear it on the cut. Then water the tree. If
fruits are destroyed before they ripen, mix the powders
[Page881-b+ 64]
of horse-gram, black-gram, green-gram, barley and se-
sam with ghee and smear the tree and water it. Water-
ing the tree with water and ghee will make the tree
flower and yield fruits quickly. Mix powdered dung of
sheep, powdered Barley, sesam, and cow's flesh with
water and keep it for seven days. Then water the tree
with this water. This will make any tree yield more fruits
and flowers. Watering the trees with fish-water will
make them yield fruits more quickly. Mixture of Vermi-
fuge seed, fish and rice is a good manure. This manure
is a good remedy for all diseases of trees. (Agni Purāṇa
Chapter 281).
