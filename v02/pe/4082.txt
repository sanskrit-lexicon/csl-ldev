MĀGADHAS¦. A particular tribe of people. If the work
<div n="lb"/>of Sūtas was to drive chariots and the work of Pulkasas
<div n="lb"/>to hunt, the work of the Māgadhas was that of an
<div n="lb"/>adulator. (Chapter 151, Agni Purāṇa). This work of
<div n="lb"/>a flatterer was given to them by Brahmā. When the
[Page461-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>emperor Pṛthu was born, Brahmā conducted a Yāga.
<div n="lb"/>On the day of sutyā at the place of Somābhiṣava of the
<div n="lb"/>Yāga a very intelligent Sūta was born. At the same yāga
<div n="lb"/>a Māgadha also was born. He was a great scholar. Then
<div n="lb"/>the sages told Māgadha and Sūta thus: “Praise this king
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu, who is the valorous son of Vena. Praising is the
<div n="lb"/>fittest work suited to you both. Pṛthu deserves praise.”
<div n="NI"/>Then the Sūta-Māgadhas placing their hands on their
<div n="lb"/>breasts with respect said, “What do we know of the
<div n="lb"/>qualities and capabilities of a king just born? His fame
<div n="lb"/>is not known. Based on what should we sing praises of
<div n="lb"/>him?” Hearing this the sages said that they should
<div n="lb"/>praise him for the qualities which he would be possess-
<div n="lb"/>ing in future. The king was pleased to hear that. Sūta-
<div n="lb"/>Māgadhas started singing eulogistic songs based on the
<div n="lb"/>qualities and exploits of a Pṛthu to be. Pṛthu then
<div n="lb"/>appointed Sūta as his charioteer and Māgadha as his
<div n="lb"/>adulator. From then onwards the Sūta family became
<div n="lb"/>charioteers and the Māgadha family flatterers. (Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ters 13—70 Aṃsa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
