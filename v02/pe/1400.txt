CAMARA¦. (CAMARĪ). An animal whose tail is its most
important and valued organ. In the course of its move-
ments in the forest if the tail gets entangled anywhere
it is supposed to lie down there till the tail is freed by
itself. About the origin of Camara, the following story
is told in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. Krodhavaśā, daughter
of Dakṣaprajāpati and wife of Kaśyapa had ten daugh-
ters, viz. Mṛgī, Mṛgamadā, Hari, Bhadramadā,
Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Śvetī, Surasā, Surabhi and Kadrū.
To Mṛgamadā the Sṛmaras and Camaras owe their
origin. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Canto 14).
