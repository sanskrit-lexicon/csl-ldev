CIRĀYUS¦. An ancient King of the country Cirāyu.
<div n="lb"/>Nāgārjuna was a minister of this King. Nāgārjuna knew
<div n="lb"/>the secret of ‘Rasāyanasiddhi’. Once Nāgārjuna pre-
<div n="lb"/>pared a medicine for himself and the King which if
<div n="lb"/>taken would keep them eternally young. They took
<div n="lb"/>medicine accordingly.
<div n="NI"/>After some days a child of the minister died. Grief-
<div n="lb"/>stricken Nāgārjuna decided to prepare Amṛta which
<div n="lb"/>would eradicate death from this world. He had pre-
<div n="lb"/>pared it but there remained one more medicine to be
<div n="lb"/>added to this. The auspicious moment to add the same
<div n="lb"/>was to come only after five days and Nāgārjuna waited.
<div n="lb"/>The devas were frightened. If Amṛta was made avail-
<div n="lb"/>able on earth men would become Devas. Devas could
<div n="lb"/>not bear this and so they sent the Aśvinīkumāras to
<div n="lb"/>the earth to persuade Nāgārjuna to desist from his work
<div n="lb"/>of preparing Amṛta. Further they informed him that his
<div n="lb"/>dead child was living happily in heaven. He agreed to
<div n="lb"/>stop his work.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Cirāyus crowned his son Jīvahara as the
<div n="lb"/>heir-apparent. Overjoyed Jīvahara ran to his mother
<div n="lb"/>Dhanaparā to give her the glad tidings. Dhanaparā
<div n="lb"/>told her son thus: “My child, why should you be so
<div n="lb"/>happy to think that you have become the heir-apparent.
<div n="lb"/>Several sons of your father had already become yuvarājas
<div n="lb"/>and died before becoming King. Your father has taken
<div n="lb"/>a medicine from Nāgārjuna and that will keep him
<div n="lb"/>eternally young. None of his sons can aspire to be the
<div n="lb"/>King. Your father is now eight hundred years old and
<div n="lb"/>will live long. Many of you will become yuvarājas but
<div n="lb"/>not the King. I will therefore suggest a way to tide over
<div n="lb"/>this difficulty. Everyday in the afternoon Nāgārjuna
<div n="lb"/>would come outside the palace and enquire whether
<div n="lb"/>anybody is in need of anything. At that time he would
<div n="lb"/>give whatever was asked for. It is an opportunity when
<div n="lb"/>you can ask for his head. When Nāgārjuna is dead your
<div n="lb"/>father would either die of grief or go to the forests.
<div n="lb"/>Then you can become the King.”
<div n="NI"/>Jīvahara was pleased to hear this suggestion and he went
<div n="lb"/>that after-noon to the palace of Nāgārjuna and when
<div n="lb"/>Nāgārjuna as usual came out with his query Jīvahara
<div n="lb"/>asked for his head. Most willingly Nāgārjuna offered
<div n="lb"/>his head to be chopped off. But the effect of the medicine
<div n="lb"/>made even the strongest cut by the sword ineffective.
<div n="lb"/>Jīvahara lost many swords without Nāgārjuna getting
<div n="lb"/>even a small scratch on his neck. The hubbub brought
<div n="lb"/>the King to the scene and he immediately asked Nāgār-
<div n="lb"/>juna to withdraw his head but Nāgārjuna refused saying,
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, King, in my ninetynine previous births I have
<div n="lb"/>offered my head like this and please do not ask me to
<div n="lb"/>desist from making this offer for the hundredth time”.
[Page183-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>So saying he embraced the King and taking a powder
<div n="lb"/>from his body smeared it on the sword and asked Jīva-
<div n="lb"/>hara to strike again. This time very easily Jīvahara
<div n="lb"/>severed the head from the body of Nāgārjuna. The
<div n="lb"/>King was greatly aggrieved and he renounced all and
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest and led a pious life.
<div n="NI"/>Cirāyus' son Jīvahara became King. But Nāgārjuna's
<div n="lb"/>sons killed him and his mother died of grief. (Taraṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Ratnaprabhā Lambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
