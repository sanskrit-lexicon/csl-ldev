ANUVINDA II¦. The purāṇas refer to one Anuvinda, a
prince of Avanti. (1) He had a brother called Vinda.
(2) He was defeated by Sahadeva who set forth to sub-
jugate the kings of the south just before the Rājasūya
yajña of Dharmaputra. (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter
31, Verse 10). (3) An Akṣauhiṇī (division of army)
was despatched by Anuvinda to help Duryodhana.
(M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Verses 24, 25). (4)
On the first day of the war Vinda and Anuvinda fought
duels with Kuntibhoja. (M.B., Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
45, Verses 72-75). (5) Irāvān, son of Arjuna defeated
both Vinda and Anuvinda in the battle. (M.B., Bhīṣma
Parva, Chapter 83, Verse, 18-22). (6) They fought with
Bhīma, Arjuna and the king of Virāṭa. (M.B., Droṇa
Parva, Chapter 25, Verses 20). (7) Anuvinda was killed
by Arjuna. (M.B., Droṇa parva, Chapter 399, Verses
27-29). (8) Vinda and Anuvinda had a sister called
Mitravindā. The three of them were the children of
Rājādhidevī, sister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's father. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
married Mitravindā, which her brother did not like.
This was their reason for quitting the Pāṇḍava camp
[Page045-b+ 65]
and fighting on the side of the Kauravas. (Bhāgavata,
Daśama Skandha, Chapter 58, Verses 30, 31).
