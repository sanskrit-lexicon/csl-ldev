CITRASENA¦ XIII. A Mahārāja who obtained sal-
<div n="lb"/>vation by observing the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī Vrata. This
<div n="lb"/>king was a great sinner having committed such sins as
<div n="lb"/>Agamyāgamana (Incest), Brahmasvāpaharaṇa (steal-
<div n="lb"/>ing things belonging to Brahmins), Surāpāna (drink-
<div n="lb"/>ing) and Prāṇihiṃsā (causing injury to living beings).
<div n="lb"/>One day while hunting he followed a tiger and at dusk
<div n="lb"/>exhausted with thirst and hunger he reached the banks
[Page188-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>of the river Yamunā. It was the day of Aṣṭamīrohiṇī
<div n="lb"/>and many maidens were observing the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī
<div n="lb"/>Vrata there. Before them was a heap of rice and
<div n="lb"/>other eatables which was given as an offering to
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and seeing the lot the King begged for some-
<div n="lb"/>thing to eat and drink. The maidens replied that it
<div n="lb"/>was a sin to take food on that day of Vrata and then there
<div n="lb"/>came a change in the mind of the King and he readily
<div n="lb"/>agreed to observe the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī vrata and did so.
<div n="lb"/>Because of this when the king died, though a great
<div n="lb"/>sinner he was, he was taken to heaven by the servants
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu. This story was told by Vasiṣṭha to Dilīpa
<div n="lb"/>to impress upon him the greatness of observing
<div n="lb"/>the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī Vrata. (Chapter 13, Padma Purāṇa).
