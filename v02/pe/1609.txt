CITRASENA¦ XIII. A Mahārāja who obtained sal-
vation by observing the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī Vrata. This
king was a great sinner having committed such sins as
Agamyāgamana (Incest), Brahmasvāpaharaṇa (steal-
ing things belonging to Brahmins), Surāpāna (drink-
ing) and Prāṇihiṃsā (causing injury to living beings).
One day while hunting he followed a tiger and at dusk
exhausted with thirst and hunger he reached the banks
[Page188-a+ 64]
of the river Yamunā. It was the day of Aṣṭamīrohiṇī
and many maidens were observing the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī
Vrata there. Before them was a heap of rice and
other eatables which was given as an offering to
Kṛṣṇa and seeing the lot the King begged for some-
thing to eat and drink. The maidens replied that it
was a sin to take food on that day of Vrata and then there
came a change in the mind of the King and he readily
agreed to observe the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī vrata and did so.
Because of this when the king died, though a great
sinner he was, he was taken to heaven by the servants
of Viṣṇu. This story was told by Vasiṣṭha to Dilīpa
to impress upon him the greatness of observing
the Aṣṭamīrohiṇī Vrata. (Chapter 13, Padma Purāṇa).
