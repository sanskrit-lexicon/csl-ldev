DHARMĀRAṆYA¦. A Brahmin. He had many children.
The major portion of his life was spent in hard work
to support his large family. After that he went in
search of means to attain heaven. In his quest, he
happened to reach the realm of Nāgas (serpents). He
entered the house of a Nāga named Padmanābha.
When he reached the house Padmanābha had been away
carrying the chariot of the Sun. Dharmāraṇya sat out-
side the house and spent a few days in vow and medita-
tion. Then Padmanābha returned. The Brāhmaṇa asked
Padmanābha about the ways of attaining heaven. The
Nāga replied that there was none superior to the Sun.
The Brahmin accepted penance and lived in the hermit-
age of Cyavana for a few days. (M.B. Śānti Parva, 4
Chapters from 361).
