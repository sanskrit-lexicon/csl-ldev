DHARMĀRAṆYA¦. A Brahmin. He had many children.
<div n="lb"/>The major portion of his life was spent in hard work
<div n="lb"/>to support his large family. After that he went in
<div n="lb"/>search of means to attain heaven. In his quest, he
<div n="lb"/>happened to reach the realm of Nāgas (serpents). He
<div n="lb"/>entered the house of a Nāga named Padmanābha.
<div n="lb"/>When he reached the house Padmanābha had been away
<div n="lb"/>carrying the chariot of the Sun. Dharmāraṇya sat out-
<div n="lb"/>side the house and spent a few days in vow and medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion. Then Padmanābha returned. The Brāhmaṇa asked
<div n="lb"/>Padmanābha about the ways of attaining heaven. The
<div n="lb"/>Nāga replied that there was none superior to the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmin accepted penance and lived in the hermit-
<div n="lb"/>age of Cyavana for a few days. (M.B. Śānti Parva, 4
<div n="lb"/>Chapters from 361).
