NAKṢATRAKALPA¦. A part of the Atharvaveda. The
great hermit Muñjakeśa had divided the Atharvaveda
into five parts called Nakṣatrakalpa, Vedakalpa,
Saṃhitākalpa, Āṅgirasakalpa and Śānti Kalpa.
Nakṣatra Kalpa deals with the order of worshipping the
Nakṣatras(stars), Veda Kalpa deals with the activities of
Brahmā as a Ṛtvik (family priest), the Saṃhitā Kalpa,
the mantras (spells and incantations). In Āṅgirasa Kalpa
sorcery and enchantment and in Śāntikalpa, Śāntis
(Alleviation or cure) of horse, elephant etc. are given.
