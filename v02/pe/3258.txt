KANYAKUBJA¦. (KĀNYAKUBJA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A city of Purāṇic fame on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river Gaṅgā. This is the same place which
<div n="lb"/>is now known as Kanauj. Viśvāmitra was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Gādhi, King of Kanyākubja.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of this city.%} Once there was a great sage
<div n="lb"/>named Kuśa who was the son of Brahmā. He had of
<div n="lb"/>his wife Vaidarbhī four sons named Kuśāmba, Kuśa-
<div n="lb"/>nābha, Asūrtarajasa and Vasu. Kuśa asked them each
<div n="lb"/>to rule a country and so each of them built a city of
<div n="lb"/>his own. Kuśāmba named his city Kauśāmbī, Kuśa-
<div n="lb"/>nābha gave his city the name of Mahodayapura,
<div n="lb"/>Asūrtarajasa called his city Dharmāraṇya and Vasu
<div n="lb"/>called his city Girivraja. Of these Mahodayapura,
<div n="lb"/>city of Kuśanābha, became later famous as Kanyākubja.
<div n="lb"/>(Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Mahodayapura became Kanyākubja.%} Kuśanābha
<div n="lb"/>begot a hundred daughters of the nymph Ghṛtācī
<div n="lb"/>Those beautiful girls were once playing in the forests
<div n="lb"/>when the wind-god fell in love with them. The girls
<div n="lb"/>rejected his love and Vāyu getting angry with them
<div n="lb"/>cursed them and made them hunchbacks. Because the
<div n="lb"/>hundred Kanyakās (girls) became Kubjās (hunch-
<div n="lb"/>backs) at that place, the place became known as Kanyā-
<div n="lb"/>kubja.
<div n="NI"/>When the daughters returned to the palace as hunch-
<div n="lb"/>backs Kuśanābha was greatly distressed. Weeping, the
<div n="lb"/>girls told him what had happened. At that time a sage
<div n="lb"/>named Cūlī was performing penance in a forest nearby.
<div n="lb"/>Somadā, daughter of Ūrmilā, a gandharva lady, married
<div n="lb"/>Cūlī and they got a son named Brahmadatta. This
<div n="lb"/>Brahmadatta married the hundred hunchbacks of
<div n="lb"/>Kuśanābha and the very touch of Brahmadatta trans-
<div n="lb"/>formed the hunchbacks into beautiful girls.
<div n="NI"/>After having given his daughters in marriage Kuśanābha
<div n="lb"/>conducted a Putrakāmeṣṭi yāga to get a son. In that
<div n="lb"/>Yāga Brahmā appeared in person and blessed Kuśanābha
<div n="lb"/>and he got a son. The son was named Gādhi.
<F>1) Gādhi—This is found as ‘Gādhi’ in Mahābhārata and ‘Gādha’ in Rāmāyaṇa.</F> Gādhi
<div n="lb"/>got a son and a daughter. The son was named Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra and the daughter, Satyavatī. Ṛcīka married
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī. Gādhi and Viśvāmitra were the rulers of
<div n="lb"/>Kanyākubja. See under ‘Ṛcīka, Viśvāmitra’—(Sargas
<div n="lb"/>32 to 34, Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Nārada and Kanyākubja.%} There was a very big lake
<div n="lb"/>in Kanyākubja. Mahāviṣṇu once showed Māyā to
<div n="lb"/>Nārada at that place. (See under ‘Nārada’).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Viśvāmitra and Indra take wine together.%} Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>and Indra took wine together at Kanyākubja. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>17, Chapter 87, Vana Parva).
