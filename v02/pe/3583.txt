KOLLAVARṢA¦. (MALAYĀLAM ERA). Several opinions
<div n="lb"/>have been brought forward about the starting of the
<div n="lb"/>Malayālam Era. There is great controversy as to the
<div n="lb"/>causes of starting this new era. The opinion of Śaṅ-
<div n="lb"/>kuṇṇi Menon is as follows. The King Udayamārtaṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>varmā called together at Quilon, an assembly of the
<div n="lb"/>learned men and astronomers of the time, in Kalivarṣa
<div n="lb"/>3926 (A.D. 825) and made astronomical researches and
<div n="lb"/>taking into account the movements and positions of the
<div n="lb"/>various planets in the solar system, started a new era
<div n="lb"/>beginning with the month of Ciṅṅam (August-Septem-
<div n="lb"/>ber). This new era commenced on the 15th of August
<div n="lb"/>825 A.D. All the learned men and scholars of the time
<div n="lb"/>welcomed this Malayālam era. The neighbouring king-
<div n="lb"/>doms also recognized this new era. Reckoning of dates
<div n="lb"/>based on this Malayālam Era is seen in the ‘Madura
<div n="lb"/>and Tinnevelly Stone-edicts and copper edicts.’ On
<div n="lb"/>the fifth day of Ciṅṅaṃ of the first year of M.E., five
<div n="lb"/>royal families of Travancore met together and took a
<div n="lb"/>decision that the festival days of the temples should be
<div n="lb"/>reckoned according to the Malayālam Era. The contro-
<div n="lb"/>versy is not about the starting of the new Era, but the
<div n="lb"/>reasons for starting the new era.
<div n="NI"/>Logan says that the Malayālam Era was started in
<div n="lb"/>commemoration of the conversion of Ceramān Perumāl
<div n="lb"/>to Islam and his pilgrimage to Mecca. But there is im-
<div n="lb"/>propriety in thinking that the Hindu subjects of a King
<div n="lb"/>would commemorate the conversion of their King into
<div n="lb"/>Islam religion. Some say that the new era was started
<div n="lb"/>to commemorate the erection of a Śaivite temple. An-
<div n="lb"/>other argument is that a new era was started in memory
<div n="lb"/>of the exhortation of Śrī Śaṅkarācārya to the Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>of Quilon, to do away with the irregularities seen in the
<div n="lb"/>Hindu religion. The period of Śaṅkarācārya has not
<div n="lb"/>yet been decided definitely. The opinion accepted by
<div n="lb"/>scholars on this subject is that of K.B. Pathak, accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to whom Śaṅkarācārya lived from 787 to 819 A.D.
<div n="lb"/>If this is accepted as true, the exhortation made in
<div n="lb"/>825 A.D. should be by somebody else and the Malayā-
[Page415-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>lam Era should have been established for some ot her
<div n="lb"/>reasons.
<div n="NI"/>Another opinion is that the new era was established
<div n="lb"/>to commemorate the independence given to the two
<div n="lb"/>Kolattiri Kings (North and South) by the Perumāl. The
<div n="lb"/>North Kolattiri family should have begun the new era
<div n="lb"/>on the first day of Kanni (the second month) and the
<div n="lb"/>South Kolattiri family on the first day of Ciṅṅaṃ
<div n="lb"/>(the first month). (Because in Malabar area, the era
<div n="lb"/>commences on the first day of Kanni.). Another opinion
<div n="lb"/>that is prevalent is that Kollavarṣa was started to com-
<div n="lb"/>memorate the erection of the two towns of Quilon
<div n="lb"/>(North and South). But even two centuries before A.D.
<div n="lb"/>825 the town of South Quilon had become famous. So it
<div n="lb"/>is an objection to this argument. Some are of opinion
<div n="lb"/>that a new era was started in commemoration of
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkaravijaya (the victory of Śaṅkara) due to the
<div n="lb"/>fact that the Brahmins of the north and the south
<div n="lb"/>alike accepted the teachings of Śaṅkarācārya. But it is
<div n="lb"/>difficult to believe that the northerners and the souther-
<div n="lb"/>ners accepted the teachings of Śaṅkarācārya on a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular date and issued a declaration to that effect and
<div n="lb"/>started a new era. Some connect the starting of the
<div n="lb"/>New Era with the ‘Tiruvoṇam’ a grand festival of the
<div n="lb"/>Malayālees. But it cannot be believed that a national
<div n="lb"/>festival was started by a single man. According to
<div n="lb"/>Logan it would appear that the grand festival of Tiru-
<div n="lb"/>voṇam was started to commemorate the journey of
<div n="lb"/>Perumāl to Mecca. But the conversion episode is more
<div n="lb"/>likely to be considered as a blasphemy and the Kings
<div n="lb"/>and people of Malayāla land are not likely to com-
<div n="lb"/>memorate it. Prof. Sundaran Pillai has cut all the
<div n="lb"/>arguments given above and brought forward a new
<div n="lb"/>theory. His inference is that the new Era is the trans-
<div n="lb"/>formation of an old era known as Saptarṣivatsara
<div n="lb"/>(year of the seven sages) or Śāstrasaṃvatsara (scien-
<div n="lb"/>tific year) which prevailed throughout India and
<div n="lb"/>is still in force in Kaśmīra. In A.D. 897 Saptarṣi-
<div n="lb"/>Vatsara was 4972 and it was known as merely 72, and
<div n="lb"/>that if all the hundreds are taken away, the remaining
<div n="lb"/>figure will be the same as that of the Kollavarṣa. That
<div n="lb"/>is, at the expiry of each century the Saptarṣivatsara
<div n="lb"/>begins as one, two and so on. But the Saptarṣivatsara
<div n="lb"/>begins in the month of Meṭam (9th month) where-
<div n="lb"/>as Kollavarṣa begins in Ciṅṅam. He explains this differ-
<div n="lb"/>ence also. His opinion is that the Nambūtiri Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>took some time to reach the country of Malayāla from
<div n="lb"/>North Indian countries and they had been using their
<div n="lb"/>Saptarṣivatsara up to the time of their arrival in Mala-
<div n="lb"/>yāla and after their arrival they adopted some slight
<div n="lb"/>modifications in the era according to the requirements
<div n="lb"/>of the new settlement, and renewed the Saptarṣivatsara.
<div n="lb"/>Gopala lyer, the great exponent of the Vedānta
<div n="lb"/>philosophy, says as follows about Kollavarṣa in his
<div n="lb"/>‘Chronology of Ancient India’: “Kaliyuga and
<div n="lb"/>Kollavarṣa commenced in B.C. 1176.” But Kollavarṣa
<div n="lb"/>is divided into groups of recurring thousands. This
<div n="lb"/>has a close connection with Saptarṣi Vatsara, which
<div n="lb"/>also might have commenced in B.C. 1176. The year
<div n="lb"/>mentioned above completed 2000 by A.D. 824. The
<div n="lb"/>third recurring thousand begins in A.D. 825, under the
<div n="lb"/>name Kollavarṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Princent, Buchanan and Burnell are the three memo-
<div n="lb"/>rable western scholars who have expressed their
<div n="lb"/>opinions about Kollavarṣa. Pṛincent connected
[Page415-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Kollavarṣa with Paraśurāma. Buchanan said that
<div n="lb"/>the Malayālees have a recurring of every millennium.
<div n="lb"/>Burnell has stated in his book “South Indian Paleo-
<div n="lb"/>graphy”, that the theory of recurring Millennium is
<div n="lb"/>wrong.
<div n="NI"/>An astronomer who was a contemporary of the King
<div n="lb"/>who established the Malayālam era has stated in his
<div n="lb"/>work called ‘Śaṅkaranārāyaṇīya’ (a manuscript in
<div n="lb"/>Palm leaves) that an astronomical movement was
<div n="lb"/>reckoned and a new era was started at Quilon. This
<div n="lb"/>palm leaf manuscript is kept in the Manuscripts
<div n="lb"/>Library at Trivandrum.
