BHAKṢAKA¦. A Śūdra sinner. In Padma Purāṇa the
<div n="lb"/>following story is related about this Śūdra.
<div n="NI"/>Bhakṣaka who was once going aimlessly somewhere
<div n="lb"/>felt extremely thirsty, and quenched his thirst by
<div n="lb"/>drinking water which was found near the small plat-
<div n="lb"/>form raised for the holy Tulasī shrub. The sanctity of
<div n="lb"/>the water thus drunk washed away all the sin attached
<div n="lb"/>to him. Some time later he was killed by a forest-
<div n="lb"/>dweller, and he attained svargaloka (heaven). Bhakṣaka,
<div n="lb"/>in his previous birth, was a king who led a voluptuous
<div n="lb"/>life, and he, once, robbed a very beautiful woman of
<div n="lb"/>her chastity, and it was as a punishment for the sin
<div n="lb"/>that the King had to be born, in the next birth, in the
<div n="lb"/>womb of a Śūdra woman. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahma
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Chapter 22).
