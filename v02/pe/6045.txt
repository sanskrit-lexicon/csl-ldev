ŚAMBARA I¦. An asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Various Purāṇas refer to this leader of the
<div n="lb"/>asuras as having played a prominent part in the dev-
<div n="lb"/>āsura war. After many such wars he was killed by
<div n="lb"/>Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śambara's magic power.%} He possessed marvellous
<div n="lb"/>magic powers. Once while fighting with him, the
<div n="lb"/>Devas were non-plussed by his magical powers, and
<div n="lb"/>they hid themselves in a forest. Śambara was pleased
<div n="lb"/>and he roamed about freely without any fear and
<div n="lb"/>burnt the palaces of the protectors of the world. The
<div n="lb"/>Devas left their homes and disappeared in disguise.
<div n="lb"/>The Devas began killing those whom Śambara had
<div n="lb"/>appointed as army-chieftains. To counter this attack
<div n="lb"/>by the Devas, he created three powerful asuras by his
<div n="lb"/>powers of magic. The three asuras called Dama,
<div n="lb"/>Vyāla and Ghaṭa began killing the warriors of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas, and the Devas told Brahmā at Satyaloka about
<div n="lb"/>the depredations of the asura. Brahmā encouraged
<div n="lb"/>them for further fighting, and the three asuras were
<div n="lb"/>killed and Śambara ran away and hid himself.
<div n="lb"/>(Jñānavāsiṣṭha Sthitiprakaraṇam).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śambara in Ṛgveda.%} There are various references
<div n="lb"/>to Śambara in the Ṛgveda. He was King of the
<div n="lb"/>Dasyus. He had mastery over hundred cities. The forts
<div n="lb"/>and trenches in those cities were very strong. The
<div n="lb"/>forts are referred to as Aśvamayī, Āyasī, Śatabhujī etc.
<div n="lb"/>in the Ṛgveda. The chief enemies of the Aryans were
<div n="lb"/>the race of people called Paṇis in the city. There is a
<div n="lb"/>hint about the killing of Śambara in Sūkta 17, Anuvāka
<div n="lb"/>8, Maṇḍala 1 of the Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Śambara was Kaśyapaprajāpati's son by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Danu.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Daśaratha had, at the request of the Devas de-
<div n="lb"/>feated Śambara in a war fought in Devaloka. (See
