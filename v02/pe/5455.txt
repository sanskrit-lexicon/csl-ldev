PULAKA¦. A daitya who was transformed into an animal.
There is a story in the Skanda Purāṇa about him thus—
Pulaka performed penance and got from Śiva a boon
that he should possess astonishing smell in his body. The
demon used to entice even celestial ladies by means of
his smell. He thus became a menace to the three
worlds. Devas complained to Śiva. Śiva got angry
and commanded him to abandon his demoniac form
and become an animal. Pulaka agreed to do so but
requested Śiva to grant him the smell even in his state
of an animal. Śiva granted that.
