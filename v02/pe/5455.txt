PULAKA¦. A daitya who was transformed into an animal.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story in the Skanda Purāṇa about him thus—
<div n="lb"/>Pulaka performed penance and got from Śiva a boon
<div n="lb"/>that he should possess astonishing smell in his body. The
<div n="lb"/>demon used to entice even celestial ladies by means of
<div n="lb"/>his smell. He thus became a menace to the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds. Devas complained to Śiva. Śiva got angry
<div n="lb"/>and commanded him to abandon his demoniac form
<div n="lb"/>and become an animal. Pulaka agreed to do so but
<div n="lb"/>requested Śiva to grant him the smell even in his state
<div n="lb"/>of an animal. Śiva granted that.
