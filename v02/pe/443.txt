ARJUNAKA¦. A hunter. Dharmaputra was called to his
<div n="lb"/>side by Bhīṣma his body torn by arrows in fight and he
<div n="lb"/>felt very sad and sorry to see Bhīṣma in that state. To
<div n="lb"/>console Dharmaputra Bhīṣma related a story and this
<div n="lb"/>hunter was one of the characters in the story. The story
<div n="lb"/>may be summarised as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once, the son of an old Brahmin woman Gautamī,
<div n="lb"/>died on account of snake-bite. A hunter caught and
<div n="lb"/>brought before Gautamī the snake. His object was to
<div n="lb"/>kill it immediately. But the serpent proved its innocence
<div n="lb"/>by pleading that it bit the boy impelled and prompted
<div n="lb"/>by Death. At once death (mṛtyu) appeared on the
<div n="lb"/>scene and explained that it was prompted by the God
<div n="lb"/>of Death. And, it was the child who was responsible for
<div n="lb"/>the cause of death, and Gautamī was the cause for the
<div n="lb"/>birth of the child. Ultimately Gautamī herself assumed
<div n="lb"/>responsibility for the sin. Bhīṣma consoled Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra by telling that as in the case of Gautamī in
<div n="lb"/>the story, the cause for every effect was the chain
<div n="lb"/>of Karma. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 1).
