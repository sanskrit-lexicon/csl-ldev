PĀṆINI¦. The author of the Sanskrit Grammar, Pāṇi-
<div n="lb"/>nīya.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} There is nowhere else in this
<div n="lb"/>world a grammar so scientific and so complete as
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇinīya. The book contains about four thousand
<div n="lb"/>aphorisms. Pāṇini was an inspired sage and he got his
<div n="lb"/>knowledge from Śiva. It has not been possible to gather
<div n="lb"/>much information about the life of such a celebrated
<div n="lb"/>grammarian. Patañjali believes that he was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Dākṣi. He addresses Pāṇini as Acārya, Bhagavān and
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi. The Chinese traveller Huen Tsang says that
<div n="lb"/>the grammar of all the languages in this world has its
<div n="lb"/>origin from Pāṇinīya. Rāmabhadradīkṣita says that
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇini was the son of the sage Pāṇi.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Life period.%} There is difference of opinion regarding
<div n="lb"/>the period during which Pāṇini lived. Dr. Goldstucker and
<div n="lb"/>Bhandarkar believe that Pāṇini lived before 500 B.C.
<div n="lb"/>while Vincent Smith and Belvelkar fix the period in
<div n="lb"/>700 B.C. Patañjali, the author of the celebrated
<div n="lb"/>‘Mahābhāṣya’ (commentary on Pāṇinīya) lived in
<div n="lb"/>200 B.C. Patañjali has contradicted many of the un-
<div n="lb"/>just criticisms made by Kātyāyana about Pāṇinīya. So
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇini must have lived before Kātyāyana. Pāṇini has
<div n="lb"/>made no reference to Buddha and so he must have
<div n="lb"/>lived before Buddha. Pāṇini has shown great grasp
<div n="lb"/>over the laws of Smṛti and so he must have lived after
<div n="lb"/>Manu. Considering all these facts together it will be
<div n="lb"/>proper to fix the period of the end of the sixth century
<div n="lb"/>or the beginning of the seventh century B.C.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Place of birth.%} Evidences are lacking to correctly
<div n="lb"/>fix the birth-place of Pāṇini. Many pandits believe
<div n="lb"/>that Pāṇini was born in the village of Śālātura in the
<div n="lb"/>city of Attock in the state of Gāndhāra. But Pāṇini has
<div n="lb"/>spent the major portion of his life in Pāṭalīputra. So
<div n="lb"/>some pandits are of opinion that only the ancestors
<div n="lb"/>of Pāṇini belonged to the village of Śālātura and
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇini was born and brought up in Pāṭalīputra.
<div n="lb"/>Jaimini and Bhartṛhari have stated that Pāṇini was a
<div n="lb"/>Śiṣṭa. Śiṣṭas were brahmins well-versed in the Śāstras
<div n="lb"/>and devoid of earthly pleasures who inhabited the area
<div n="lb"/>surrounded by the Himālayas in the north, Kālakavana
<div n="lb"/>(Bengal) in the east, Vindhya mountains in the south
<div n="lb"/>and the Ādarśa (Aravalli mountains) in the west.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%A legend.%} There was a preceptor named Varṣa in
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭalīputra and Pāṇini had his education under him.
<div n="lb"/>Varṣa gradually acquired a large number of disciples
<div n="lb"/>and Pāṇini was the most dull-witted among them. But
<div n="lb"/>he was greatly devoted to his Guru and this pleased
[Page566-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the wife of the Guru and she took great interest in
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇini. One day she called Pāṇini to her side and
<div n="lb"/>advised him to go to the Himālayas and do penance
<div n="lb"/>to propitiate Śiva to get knowledge from him. Pāṇini
<div n="lb"/>obeying instructions went and performed penance.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva was pleased and he granted him knowledge about
<div n="lb"/>a new grammar. By the time Pāṇini came back from
<div n="lb"/>the Himālayas with his grammar another disciple of
<div n="lb"/>Varṣa, Vararuci by name, had come down with a
<div n="lb"/>grammar from Indra. Pāṇini challenged Vararuci for a
<div n="lb"/>polemical contest. It took eight days and on the eighth
<div n="lb"/>day Vararuci defeated Pāṇini. At once there was a
<div n="lb"/>great humming sound from the sky and the grammar
<div n="lb"/>book of Vararuci was destroyed. After that Pāṇini
<div n="lb"/>defeated all his co-disciples in polemics and emerged
<div n="lb"/>as the greatest grammarian of the world. (Kathāpīṭha-
<div n="lb"/>lambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara, Taraṅga 4).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The birth of Pāṇinīya.%} When Pāṇini was doing
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Śiva the latter appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him and started dancing. He sounded his musical
<div n="lb"/>instrument ḍhakkā (a large double drum) fourteen
<div n="lb"/>times. Each of it produced a different sound as follows
<div n="lb"/>(1) Aiuṇ (2) Ṛḷk (3) Eoṅ (4) Aiauc (5) Hayavaraṭ
<div n="lb"/>(6) laṇ (7) ñamaṅaṇanam (8) Jhabhañ (9) Ghaḍha-
<div n="lb"/>dhaṣ (10) Jabagaḍadaś (11) Khaphachaṭhathacaṭatav
<div n="lb"/>(12) Kapay (13) Śaṣasar (14) Hal. Pāṇini accepted
<div n="lb"/>these fourteen sounds as fourteen sūtras (aphorisms).
<div n="lb"/>They are called Pratyāhārasūtras. (The comprehension
<div n="lb"/>of several letters or affixes into one syllable effected
<div n="lb"/>by combining the first letter of a Sūtra with its final
<div n="lb"/>indicatory letter.). These Sūtras are now known as
<div n="lb"/>Māheśvarasūtras.
<div n="NI"/>Pāṇini's grammar contains eight chapters and each
<div n="lb"/>chapter has got four pādas and each pāda contains
<div n="lb"/>many sūtras. He has taken examples from worldly
<div n="lb"/>and spiritual texts in literature. He has dealt with the
<div n="lb"/>origin of sounds, connection between two words and
<div n="lb"/>all such etymological details. Pāṇini's grammar is not a
<div n="lb"/>mere grammar book. It is a science of language in it-
<div n="lb"/>self.
