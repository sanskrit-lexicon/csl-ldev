TĪRTHA¦. A holy place. Even from very ancient times
<div n="lb"/>the people of Bhārata believed in the sacredness of holy
<div n="lb"/>places and they considered a pilgrimage to holy places
<div n="lb"/>as a part and parcel of their life. Almost all the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>have praised the greatness of holy places.
<div n="NI"/>It is not true that all those who visit holy places and
<div n="lb"/>bathe in the sacred ponds there would get salvation. In
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 11 of Padma Purāṇa it is stated thus:
<div n="NI"/>He would get salvation whose limbs, mind, knowledge,
<div n="lb"/>austerity and fame are under his own control. He who
<div n="lb"/>lives clean in body, without egoism, contented and never
<div n="lb"/>accepting gifts for services done would get salvation by
<div n="lb"/>visiting holy places. He who would fast if he did not
<div n="lb"/>get food, whose organs of sense are all under control
<div n="lb"/>would get salvation if he visits holy places. He who is
<div n="lb"/>righteous, free from anger, treats all animate objects
<div n="lb"/>like himself would get salvation if he visits holy place.
<div n="NI"/>Once the great sage Cyavana told Prahlāda thus: “Only
<div n="lb"/>those who are pure in heart would get the benefit of
<div n="lb"/>visiting sacred places. It is a sin for others to do pilgrim-
<div n="lb"/>age. The banks of Gaṅgā are crowded with villages
<div n="lb"/>and cities. Many types of people like Parayas, Fisher-
<div n="lb"/>men, Vaṅgas, Khasas, Huns and Mlecchas live there.
<div n="lb"/>They bathe in the holy river and drink the holy water,
<div n="lb"/>but they do not get salvation because their mind and
<div n="lb"/>heart are not clean.” (4th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
