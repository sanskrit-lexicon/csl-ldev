<div n="NI"/>King Kuru was the grandfather of the reputed Vena and
the great grandfather of emperor Pṛthu. Aṅga was the
father of Vena. Not much is said about this Kuru in
the Purāṇas. Kuru had ten brothers called Puru, Ūru,
Śatadyumna, Tapasvī, Satyavāk, Śuci, Agniṣṭhu,
Adhiratha, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Kuru had
by his wife Ātreyī seven sons called Aṅga, Sumanas
Svāti, Kratu, Aṅgiras, Gaya and Śibi, and to Aṅga
was born by his wife Sunīthā the son, who became
reputed as Vena. Pṛthu was Vena's son. Pṛthu had
five sons called Antardhāna, Vādī, Sūta, Māgadha,
Pālita. To Antardhāna was born of his wife Śikhaṇḍinī
a son called Havirdhāna, to whom were born by his
wife Dhiṣaṇā six sons called Prācīnabarhis, Śukra, Gaya,
Kṛṣṇa, Vṛaja and Ajina. The above is the only inform-
ation available about this Kuru dynasty in the
Purāṇas. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 13),
