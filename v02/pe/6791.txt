ŚRUTĀYUDHA¦. A king of the Kaliṅga land. He was
the son of Varuṇa by Parṇāśā. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 4, Verse 23; Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 16, Verse
34).
<div n="NI"/>In Bhārata battle he took his stand on the Kaurava side
and at first clashed with Bhīmasena. Even at the begin-
ning of the battle, Bhīma killed Satya and Satyadeva,
two of the assistants of Śrutāyudha. (M.B. Bhīṣma
Parva, Chapter 50, Verse 69). In the end, he used his
cudgel—which was given to him by Varuṇa—against Śrī
Kṛṣṇa who did not take part in the battle at all. Śrutā-
yudha died by his own Cudgel. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
Chapter, 67, Verses 43-48). (See also under Śrutāyus
