AMOGHĀ¦. Śantanu Maharṣi's wife. Once Brahmā
visited Śantanu Maharṣi's Āśrama. As the Maharṣi was
[Page031-a+ 65]
not at home, it was Amoghā who received the guest
with due reverence. Fascinated by the irresistible
charm of Amoghā, Brahmā had an involuntary emis-
sion of seminal fluid. He felt ashamed of his own weak-
ness and left the Āśrama immediately. The Maharṣi
who returned to the Āśrama soon after, came to know
from his wife whose semen it was. He asked Amoghā to
accept Brahma Deva's precious semen and not to let it
be wasted. Being a devoted wife, she accepted it, but
unable to bear the divine pregnancy, she deposited it
in the water lying in the valley of the Yugandhara
mountain. From that time, it became a place of holy
bath, known as Lohita. It was by bathing in this holy
water that Paraśurāma washed away his sin of annihi-
lating the Kṣatriyas. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, 55).
