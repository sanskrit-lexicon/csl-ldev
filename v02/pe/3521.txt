<div n="lb"/>the rebirths of Madhu and Kaiṭabha. For details see
<div n="lb"/>under Kaiṭabha and Atikāya.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and genealogy.%} Mahābhārata mentions as
<div n="lb"/>follows about the birth of this giant:—Viśravas was
<div n="lb"/>born from Pulastya the son of Brahmā. Kubera was
<div n="lb"/>born from Viśravas. Kubera ruled over Laṅkā. Viśravas
<div n="lb"/>who had no one to help him once looked with anger at
<div n="lb"/>Kubera, who, understanding the wish of his father gave
<div n="lb"/>him three giantesses named Puṣpotkaṭā, Rākā and
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī as attendants. They attended on him faithfully
<div n="lb"/>and Viśravas was pleased with them. To Viśravas two
<div n="lb"/>sons named Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa were born by
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpotkaṭā, Vibhīṣaṇa was born by Mālinī and the
<div n="lb"/>twin sister and brother Śūrpaṇakhā and Khara were
<div n="lb"/>born by Rākā. By and by Khara became a famous
<div n="lb"/>archer. Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed penance to obtain boons and Khara and Śūrpa-
<div n="lb"/>ṇakhā stayed with them to serve them. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 275).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other brothers.%} Khara had two other brothers
<div n="lb"/>Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The slaughter of Khara.%} While Śrī Rāma, Sītā and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa were staying in the forest of Daṇḍakāraṇya
<div n="lb"/>Śūrpaṇakhā the sister of Khara came there once and
<div n="lb"/>tried to get one of the brothers Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>as her husband. Lakṣmaṇa cut off her nose and ears.
[Page410-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>She went to Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras and lamented
<div n="lb"/>before them. The three of them immediately started
<div n="lb"/>with an army of fourteen thousand giants and fought
<div n="lb"/>with Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, who killed every one of
<div n="lb"/>them. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Sargas 19
<div n="lb"/>to 30).
