KṚTAVARMĀ¦. A King of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty. In the
<div n="lb"/>previous generation of Vṛṣṇi also a Kṛtavarman is notic-
<div n="lb"/>ed. The genealogy of both is given below.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti—Yadu—Sahasrajit—Śatajit—Hehaya—Dharma
<div n="lb"/>Kunti—Sadājit—Dhanaka.
<div n="NI"/>Dhanaka had four sons called Kṛtavīrya, Kṛtāgni, Kṛta-
<div n="lb"/>varman and Kṛtaujas, and one of the four was the first
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarman.
<div n="NI"/>The dynasty continues again from Kṛtavīrya—Kṛtavīrya-
<div n="lb"/>Kārtavīryārjuna—Madhu—Vṛṣṇi—Yudhājit—
<div n="lb"/>Śini—Satyaka—Sātyaki (Yuyudhāna)—Jaya—Kaṇi—
<div n="lb"/>Anamitra—Pṛśni—Citraratha—Viḍūratha—Śūra—Śini
<div n="lb"/>-Bhoja—Hṛdīka—Kṛtavarman.
<div n="NI"/>Hṛdīka had four sons, viz. Devavāha, Gadādhanvan,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarman and Śūra. And, Sūra begot of his wife,
<div n="lb"/>Māriṣā ten sons, i.e. Vasu, Devabhāga, Devaśravas,
<div n="lb"/>Ānaka, Sṛñjaya, Kākānīka, Śyāmaka, Vatsa, Kavūka
<div n="lb"/>and Vasudeva. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of Vasudeva. The
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarman referred to below was the brother of Kṛṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṇa's grand-father.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kṛtavarman and Syamantaka.%} King Satrājit had in his
<div n="lb"/>possession the famous gem called Syamantaka. The
<div n="lb"/>King's brother Prasena, went for hunting with this jewel
<div n="lb"/>on him. A lion killed Prasena, and Jāmbavān killed
<div n="lb"/>the lion and got the gem. A scandal was circulated to the
<div n="lb"/>effect that Śrī Kṛṣṇa had stolen the gem. But, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>got back the gem from Jāmbavān and handed it over
[Page431-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>to Satrājit, who in turn, gave his daughter Satyabhāmā
<div n="lb"/>in marriage to Kṛṣṇa. Though Satrājit wanted to give
<div n="lb"/>the gem—Syamantaka—to Kṛṣṇa as dowry, the latter
<div n="lb"/>did not accept it.
<div n="NI"/>Akrūra and Kṛtavarman were bosom friends, and they
<div n="lb"/>incited another Yādava King Śatadhanvā, to grab the
<div n="lb"/>Syamantaka. Śatadhanvā killed Satrājit and took poss-
<div n="lb"/>ession of the gem. Hearing about this murder Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma set out to kill Śatadhanvā,
<div n="lb"/>who, in great alarm, started for north after entrusting
<div n="lb"/>the gem to Akrūra and Kṛtavarman. His horse died
<div n="lb"/>at Mithilāpurī and he began running. Balabhadra and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa ran after him, caught and killed him. But, they
<div n="lb"/>did not get the Syamantaka.
<div n="NI"/>Now Akrūra and Kṛtavarman began their penance at
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī. Seven years passed thus when famine broke out
<div n="lb"/>in Dvārakā. When once upon a time famine stalked
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī the king had brought Śvaphalka, father of Akrūra,
<div n="lb"/>over to Kāśī, and there was no more famine in the
<div n="lb"/>country. Therefore, when famine broke out in Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>the Yadavas thought the presence of Śvaphalka's son,
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra would dispel the famine. Accordingly Akrūra
<div n="lb"/>was recalled to Dvārakā, and along with him returned
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarman also. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra decided
<div n="lb"/>that Syamantaka should be kept by Akrūra himself.
