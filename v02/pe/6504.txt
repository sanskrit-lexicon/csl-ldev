SAUBHARI II¦. A hermit who had put up his hermit-
age on the Vindhya. At the time of the horse-sacrifice
of Yudhiṣṭhira, Arjuna called on this hermit Saubhari.
On that occasion the hermit told Arjuna about the
previous history of Caṇḍī, who had been cursed by the
hermit Uddālaka. It is mentioned in Jaimini Aśva-
medha Parva, Chapter 96, that Arjuna later redeemed
Caṇḍī from the curse.
