SAUTI¦. A famous son of hermit Romaharṣaṇa. The
<div n="lb"/>real name of this son was Ugraśravas. This teacher is
<div n="lb"/>responsible for the arrangement of the Mahābhārata.
<div n="lb"/>in the form that we see today.
<div n="NI"/>The story of Mahābhārata composed by Vyāsa and
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśampāyana contained only a graphic description of
<div n="lb"/>the battle of Bhārata. No vivid description of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa born of the Yādava dynasty and of the Yādavas,
<div n="lb"/>was given in it. To remove this deficiency, Sauti
<div n="lb"/>added an appendix called ‘Harivaṃśa’ to Svargārohaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva in Mahābhārata. (For further details see under
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata I).
