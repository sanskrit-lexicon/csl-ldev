GĀRGYA I¦. (TRIJAṬA) GĀRGA. A famous sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} He was one of the sons of Viśvāmitra. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>55, Chapter 4, Anuśāsana Parva). (For genealogy see
<div n="lb"/>under Viśvāmitra). He became gradually the priest of
<div n="lb"/>Gudavas. He has written a famous book called Garga-
<div n="lb"/>smṛti. Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa mentions that Gārgya is
<div n="lb"/>known as Trijaṭa also.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he became prosperous.%} Sage Gārgya had many
<div n="lb"/>children. It was while he was staying in the forest with
<div n="lb"/>his wife and children that Śrī Rāma came to that forest
<div n="lb"/>for Vanavāsa. The news of the exile of Śrī Rāma spread
<div n="lb"/>like wild-fire and many brahmins flocked to the place
<div n="lb"/>and Śrī Rāma gave them immense riches. Wife of Gār-
<div n="lb"/>gya heard the news only late and as soon as she heard
<div n="lb"/>the same she called her husband from the fields where
<div n="lb"/>he was working and taking away from him the imple-
<div n="lb"/>ments sent him post-haste to the place of Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>Trijaṭa as soon as he came to the presence of Rāma told
<div n="lb"/>him the purpose of his visit. Huge herds of cows were
<div n="lb"/>then grazing on the banks of the Yamunā river. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma told Gārgya to take a stump and throw it with
<div n="lb"/>all his strength. He did so and Śrī Rāma gave him all
<div n="lb"/>the cows grazing up to the place where the stump fell.
<div n="lb"/>It was a big lot and Gārgya became prosperous from
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards. (Sarga 32, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāṃāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gārgya's precepts on Dharma.%} The following are the
<div n="lb"/>precepts laid down by Gārgya on Dharma. (1) Be
<div n="lb"/>interested always on entertaining your guests, (2) Do not
<div n="lb"/>eat meat, (3) Do not give injury to cows and brahmins,
<div n="lb"/>(4) Perform yajña with a pure mind and pure body.
<div n="lb"/>(M. B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 127).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gārgya's place in the line of preceptors.%} Vyāsa expound-
<div n="lb"/>ed the Vedas to Vedamitra, Saubhari and Śākalya.
<div n="lb"/>Śākalya taught what he learnt to Vātsyāyana, Maud-
<div n="lb"/>galya, Śāli, Ādiśiśira, Gokhali and Yātukarṇa, Yātu-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa taught Nirukta to Bāṣkala, Krauñca, Vaitāla, and
<div n="lb"/>Vīraja. Bāṣkala combined all the other branches to-
<div n="lb"/>gether and made ‘Bālakhilyaśākhā’ and taught it to
<div n="lb"/>Bālāyini, Gārgya and Saṃsāra. The Ṛgvedācāryas
<div n="lb"/>are those from Vyāsa to Saṃsāra. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Indrasabhā and Gārgya.%} Gārgya was a shining mem-
<div n="lb"/>ber of the Indrasabhā. (Śloka 18, Chapter 7, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M. B.).
