GUPTA¦. A caste appellation. In ancient India appe-
llations to the names were put to distinguish one caste
from another. So ‘Śarmā’ was added to a brahmin name,
‘Varmā’ to a Kṣatriya name ‘Gupta’ to a Vaiṣya
name and ‘Dāsa’ to a Śūdra name. Such appellations
were considered to be a mark of nobility in those olden
days. (Chapter 153, Agni Purāṇa).
