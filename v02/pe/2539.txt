GUPTA¦. A caste appellation. In ancient India appe-
<div n="lb"/>llations to the names were put to distinguish one caste
<div n="lb"/>from another. So ‘Śarmā’ was added to a brahmin name,
<div n="lb"/>‘Varmā’ to a Kṣatriya name ‘Gupta’ to a Vaiṣya
<div n="lb"/>name and ‘Dāsa’ to a Śūdra name. Such appellations
<div n="lb"/>were considered to be a mark of nobility in those olden
<div n="lb"/>days. (Chapter 153, Agni Purāṇa).
