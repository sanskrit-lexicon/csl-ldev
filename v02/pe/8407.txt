VIRĀDHA¦. A fierce Rākṣasa (giant) whom Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa killed in the Daṇḍaka forest. Virādha was
<div n="lb"/>the rebirth of Tumburu, a Gandharva who had been
<div n="lb"/>cursed to become a Rākṣasa. The story about Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma's liberating the Gandharva from the curse and
<div n="lb"/>sending him back to the world of Gandharvas, occurs
<div n="lb"/>in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Sargas 2 to 4,
<div n="lb"/>as follows.
<div n="NI"/>In days of old, Tumburu, a Gandharva had been serv-
<div n="lb"/>ing Kubera. Once Tumburu was asked by Kubera to
<div n="lb"/>bring Rambhā. Tumburu failed in bringing Rambhā
<div n="lb"/>at the stipulated time. Kubera got angry and cursed
<div n="lb"/>Tumburu to become a Rākṣasa. Tumburu requested
<div n="lb"/>for liberation from the curse. Kubera granted his
<div n="lb"/>request and said “In Tretāyuga, Mahāviṣṇu will
<div n="lb"/>incarnate as Śrī Rāma, who with his sword will change
<div n="lb"/>your Rākṣasa form. You will regain your former form
<div n="lb"/>and will come back to the world of Gandharvas.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Tumburu took birth as the son of giant
<div n="lb"/>Jaya. This child born to Jaya by his wife Śatahradā,
<div n="lb"/>grew up and came to be known by the name Virādha.
<div n="lb"/>Two extra-ordinarily long hands and the outward
<div n="lb"/>appearances of a giant aroused fear in every living
<div n="lb"/>creature. He lived in the forest Daṇḍaka. It was at
<div n="lb"/>this time that Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa came with Sītā,
<div n="lb"/>to live in this forest. As soon as Virādha saw them he
<div n="lb"/>ran to them with a loud cry.
<div n="NI"/>“With sunken eyes and swollen stomach, widened
<div n="lb"/>mouth and an enormous body, with a fierce appearance,
<div n="lb"/>of very great height an uncouth figure, body wet with
<div n="lb"/>fat, clad in the hide of a leopard, looking like Yama
<div n="lb"/>with open mouth, with three lions, two wolves, four
<div n="lb"/>leopards, ten spotted deer and the head of a big tusker
<div n="lb"/>with tusks smeared with fat, all these caught pierced
<div n="lb"/>in an iron trident, and shouting in a roaring sound”,
<div n="lb"/>he ran to them and after taking Sītā, he began to run.
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa followed him. Virādha placed
<div n="lb"/>Sītā down and, taking Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa on each
<div n="lb"/>of his shoulders he began running. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>cut off each of his hands. But Virādha did not die.
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa decided to bury him alive.
<div n="lb"/>Virādha recognized Śrī Rāma and told him his story.
<div n="lb"/>Instantly his demoniac form changed and he regained
<div n="lb"/>his original form of a Gandharva. Thus Tumburu
<div n="lb"/>returned to the world of Devas. (See under Tumburu).
