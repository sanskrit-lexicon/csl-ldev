ULŪPĪ¦. Wife of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How she became the wife of Arjuna.%} Once Arjuna
happened to enter the palace in which Dharmaputra
was living with Pāñcālī. As a result, Arjuna had to go
on a pilgrimage for a year. (See under Irāvān). Arjuna
reached Gaṅgādvāra. When he got down into the river
Gaṅgā, he saw Ulūpī the daughter of Nāgarāja (King
of the serpents). He asked her a few questions. She
told him thus:—“I am the daughter of the serpent
Kauravya of the family of Airāvata. I came to bathe
in the river and when I saw you I grew amorous.”
Arjuna told her that Dharmaputra had imposed on him
celibacy for twelve months and that it was not
right to marry in the meantime. Ulūpī argued with
Arjuna and convinced him that it was not wrong to
marry her. Arjuna married her. A son named Irāvān
was born to her.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Ulūpī caused Arjuna to be killed and how he was%}
{%brought to life again.%} (See paras 28 and 29 under
Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The end of Ulūpī.%} After having brought Arjuna back
to life, Ulūpī reached Hastināpura with Babhruvāhana
and Citrāṅgadā. (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter
87). As soon as she reached there she greeted Kuntī,
Draupadī and Subhadrā. She gave them various kinds
of presents. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Aśrama-
vāsika Parva, Chapter I, Stanza 23 that Ulūpī served
Gāndhārī at one time. In Mahābhārata, Āśramavāsika
Parva, Chapter 10, Stanza 46 it is mentioned that Ulūpī
was greatly loved by the subjects. When the Pāṇḍavas
began the ‘great departure’ (Mahāprasthāna) Ulūpī
entered the River Ganges. Citrāṅgadā went to Maṇalū-
rapura.
<div n="NI"/>“Ulūpī, the daughter of the serpent Kauravya, jumped
into the Ganges and to Maṇalūrapura, went Citrāṅ-
gadā.” (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Mahāprasthānika Parva, Chap-
ter 1, Stanza 27).
