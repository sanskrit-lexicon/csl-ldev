SVĀYAMBHUVA¦ MANU. Son of Brahmā and the
first of the Manus.
[Page779-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Svāyambhuva Manu was born as the
mental son, and Śatarūpā as the mental daughter, of
Brahmā. Svāyambhuva did penance and acquired
boons for ruling over the subjects. He married
Śatarūpā herself. Brahmā appointed him as the
first Manu to rule over the subjects. Two sons named
Priyavrata and Uttānapāda and two daughters named
Prasūti and Ākūti, were born to Svāyambhuva by
his wife Śatarūpā. Of the two daughters Prasūti was
given to Prajāpati Dakṣa and Ākūti to Prajāpati
Ruci as wives. A son named Yajña and a daughter
named Dakṣiṇā were born to Ruci by Ākūti. The
children were twins.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that Svāyambhuva and Śatarūpā are
the first human beings. A story as given below,
occurs in Matsya Purāṇa. Brahmā took birth as a
man somewhere in Kāśmīra. Brahmā who took birth
as man, created Śatarūpā from his own body, with-
out any decrease in its radiance. Svāyambhuva
(Brahmā) appreciated the beauty of Śatarūpā. He
grew amorous. But Brahmā was ashamed of his
feeling, as Śatarūpā being half of his body, was his
daughter. Being subjected to love and shame at the
same time Svāyambhuva stood there, looking at
Śatarūpā. To avoid the look of Brahmā, Satarūpā
moved to one side. Brahmā had no courage to turn
his face to that side. So another face sprang up
on that side for him. Śatarūpā turned to four sides
and Brahmā thus got four faces. His amour subsided.
When the desire subsided, a man originated from
Brahmā. That man is Svāyambhuva. (For further
details see under Manvantara).
