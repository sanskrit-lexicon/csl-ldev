KṢUPA I¦. A Prajāpati. There is a story about the
birth of this Prajāpati in Mahābhārata. Once Brahmā
wished to perform a sacrifice. But he could not get
suitable priest as the performer of the sacrifice. So
Brahmā decided to create a befitting person as Ṛtvik
(the priest who does the rituals of the sacrifice) and
he got pregnant in his head. After a thousand years he
sneezed and a Prajāpati came out of the head of
Brahmā. That Prajāpati was Kṣupa. He made Kṣupa
his Ṛtvik. (Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 122).
<div n="NI"/>Rudra Bhagavān made him Prajāpati (the Lord of all
subjects).
