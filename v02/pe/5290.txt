PRALAYA¦ (Destruction). Pralaya is of four kinds. The
<div n="lb"/>first is nityapralaya. This is the destruction going on daily
<div n="lb"/>for all animate and inanimate objects born on earth.
<div n="lb"/>The second is Brāhmapralaya or naimittikapralaya. The
<div n="lb"/>third is Prākṛtapralaya. This is the great deluge made by
<div n="lb"/>prakṛti (nature) at the end of a thousand Caturyugas
<div n="lb"/>(four yugas). The fourth is ātyantikapralaya. This is the
<div n="lb"/>union of the soul with the Supreme Being due to Jñāna.
<div n="lb"/>Of the above the Brāhmapralaya, or naimittikapralaya
<div n="lb"/>happens at the end of a Kalpa or a day of Brahmā or
<div n="lb"/>a thousand yugas. The nature of this pralaya is as
<div n="lb"/>follows: At the end of a thousand yugas the world
<div n="lb"/>will look famished. Then there will be excessive
<div n="lb"/>drought for a hundred years together and everything
<div n="lb"/>in this world would be destroyed then. Then Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu, lord of everything in this universe, would pre-
<div n="lb"/>sent himself in the seven big rays of the Sun and
<div n="lb"/>drink to emptiness all the waters of all the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds, earth, ocean and pātāla. Then by the divine
<div n="lb"/>power of Mahāviṣṇu the seven rays of the Sun which
<div n="lb"/>had grown fat by drinking this water would become
<div n="lb"/>seven separate Suns. These Suns would burn all the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds including Pātāla. Then the earth would
<div n="lb"/>look like the back of a tortoise (Kūrmapṛṣṭha) At
<div n="lb"/>that time Rudra, equal in brilliance to Kālāgni, would
<div n="lb"/>from beneath burn the pātāla sending breaths from
<div n="lb"/>Ādiśesa. After pātāla Kālāgnirudra would burn the
[Page600-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>earth and then the heavens. Because of this all the
<div n="lb"/>worlds would look like globes of fire. Then the inhabit-
<div n="lb"/>ants of these worlds would go to Maharloka unable to
<div n="lb"/>bear the heat and from there to Janaloka. Thus Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>in the form of Rudra would destroy everything.
<div n="NI"/>Then from the face of Viṣṇu would originate clouds
<div n="lb"/>and lightning in different forms. Those clouds would
<div n="lb"/>rain incessantly for a hundred years and destroy the
<div n="lb"/>fire prevailing everywhere. When the rains become
<div n="lb"/>unbearable Vāyu would encroach upon the seats of the
<div n="lb"/>Saptarṣis in the ocean and by the breath of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>destroy all the clouds. At that time Viṣṇu, lord of all,
<div n="lb"/>would lie on the back of Ādiśeṣa in that one big
<div n="lb"/>ocean drinking vāyu (air). Viṣṇu will lie thus for a
<div n="lb"/>period of a Kalpa in yogic slumber meditating on
<div n="lb"/>Vāsudeva taking the name Madhusūdana and form
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā praised by the siddhamunis inside the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. After that he would take the form of Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and start creation.
<div n="NI"/>In Prākṛtapralaya this whole universe would lie in
<div n="lb"/>extinction for a period of two parārddhas. One
<div n="lb"/>parārddha is 100000000000000000 years (one followed
<div n="lb"/>by seventeen zeroes) and so the period of a prākṛta-
<div n="lb"/>pralaya is double the above number of years. The world
<div n="lb"/>would then come into the grip of a great drought;
<div n="lb"/>fire would break out and burn away everything in
<div n="lb"/>this world from Mahattattva to Viśeṣa. Then prompted
<div n="lb"/>by the desire of Viṣṇu, pratisañcaraṇa (back into
<div n="lb"/>nature) would occur. Then Jala (water) would
<div n="lb"/>absorb the guṇas of bhūmi like gandha (smell) and
<div n="lb"/>when the qualities of the earth are thus absorbed the
<div n="lb"/>earth would merge with pralaya. Jala is rasātmaka.
<div n="lb"/>Agni will absorb the rasa of Jala and Jala would be
<div n="lb"/>kindled. The guṇa of Agni is form and is in the form
<div n="lb"/>of Sun. Vāyu would absorb it and Agni would be
<div n="lb"/>destroyed. Vāyu would then become powerful and
<div n="lb"/>shake the world. The quality of Vāyu is touch and the
<div n="lb"/>ether would absorb that guṇa of Vāyu and Vāyu would
<div n="lb"/>be destroyed. The quality of ether is sound and it
<div n="lb"/>would be absorbed by the elements. If the elements
<div n="lb"/>are absorbed one by one the earth would merge into
<div n="lb"/>water (Jala) and Jala in Agni, and Agni in Vāyu and
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu in ether and ether in Ahaṅkāra (ego). Ahaṅkāra
<div n="lb"/>would merge in Mahattattva. This Mahattattva would
<div n="lb"/>be absorbed by Prakṛti. Prakṛti has got two forms:—
<div n="lb"/>Vyakta and Avyakta (Manifest and Un-manifest). The
<div n="lb"/>Vyakta would merge with Avyakta. Puruṣa is single,
<div n="lb"/>pure and without decay. But he is also part of Para-
<div n="lb"/>mātmā (the Supreme Being). So Prakṛti and Puruṣa
<div n="lb"/>would both merge into the Supreme Being. There are
<div n="lb"/>no distinctions, fabrications in Paramātmā, the lord of
<div n="lb"/>all. It is only an existence. It is such a Paramātmā
<div n="lb"/>that should be known and which itself is knowledge.
<div n="lb"/>The Paramātmā is beyond the Ātmā (soul). It is in
<div n="lb"/>such an indescribable Paramātmā that all are dissolv-
<div n="lb"/>ed during a Prākṛtapralaya. (Chapter 368, Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
