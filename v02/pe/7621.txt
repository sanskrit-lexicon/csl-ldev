TUGRA¦. A King extolled in the Ṛgveda. This King
sent his son Bhujyu with a large army by sea to
conquer his enemies in dvīpāntara. When they were a
long distance away from the shore the boats carrying
them capsized in a storm and the prince and army
were drowned in the sea. The prince then prayed to
the A vinīdevas and they saved him and his army from
the sea and sent them back to the palace. Those boats
could travel both in the sea and the air. (Sūkta 116,
Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda, Anuvāka 17).
