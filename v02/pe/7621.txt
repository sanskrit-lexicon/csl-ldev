TUGRA¦. A King extolled in the Ṛgveda. This King
<div n="lb"/>sent his son Bhujyu with a large army by sea to
<div n="lb"/>conquer his enemies in dvīpāntara. When they were a
<div n="lb"/>long distance away from the shore the boats carrying
<div n="lb"/>them capsized in a storm and the prince and army
<div n="lb"/>were drowned in the sea. The prince then prayed to
<div n="lb"/>the A vinīdevas and they saved him and his army from
<div n="lb"/>the sea and sent them back to the palace. Those boats
<div n="lb"/>could travel both in the sea and the air. (Sūkta 116,
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda, Anuvāka 17).
