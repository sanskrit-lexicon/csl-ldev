AVADHŪTEŚVARA¦. An incarnation of Śiva. Once
Indra and Bṛhaspati went to Kailāsa to do homage to
Śiva who clad in air only hindered their way. Indra
requested that person to get out of the way. He request-
ed repeatedly several times but in vain. Indra who got
angry took his weapon of Vajra. But Śiva froze it. More-
over fire emanated from his eye on the forehead. At the
request of Bṛhaspati Śiva turned the fire from his eye
towards Lavaṇa Samudra (the sea of Salt). Jalandhara
who was killed by Śiva had his origin in this fire.
(Śiva Purāṇa).
