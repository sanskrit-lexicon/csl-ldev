AVADHŪTEŚVARA¦. An incarnation of Śiva. Once
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Bṛhaspati went to Kailāsa to do homage to
<div n="lb"/>Śiva who clad in air only hindered their way. Indra
<div n="lb"/>requested that person to get out of the way. He request-
<div n="lb"/>ed repeatedly several times but in vain. Indra who got
<div n="lb"/>angry took his weapon of Vajra. But Śiva froze it. More-
<div n="lb"/>over fire emanated from his eye on the forehead. At the
<div n="lb"/>request of Bṛhaspati Śiva turned the fire from his eye
<div n="lb"/>towards Lavaṇa Samudra (the sea of Salt). Jalandhara
<div n="lb"/>who was killed by Śiva had his origin in this fire.
<div n="lb"/>(Śiva Purāṇa).
