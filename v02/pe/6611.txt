SIṂHIKĀ¦. A giantess. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>15, and Agni Purāṇa Chapter 19). Two sons named
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa and a daughter named
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhikā were born to Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Diti. Siṃhikā was married by Vipracitti. Two sons
<div n="lb"/>named Rāhu and Ketu were born to them. Because
<div n="lb"/>they were the sons of Siṃhikā, they came to be known
<div n="lb"/>by the name Saiṃhikeyas.
<div n="NI"/>(But it is stated in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>65, that Siṃhikā was the daughter of Prajāpati Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>and the wife of Kaśyapa.)
<div n="NI"/>A story occurs in Rāmāyaṇa, that this Siṃhikā caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of Hanūmān by his shadow and swallowed him,
<div n="lb"/>while he was jumping to Laṅkā, and that Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>escaped from her. (See under Rāma, para 27).
