ATRI I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The son of Brahmā.%} Atri Maharṣi was one of the
<div n="lb"/>mānasaputras of Brahmā. The mānasaputras were:
<div n="lb"/>Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%One of the Saptarṣis.%} Brahma's sons, Marīci, Aṅgiras,
<div n="lb"/>Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasiṣṭha are known
<div n="lb"/>as the Saptarṣis (seven sages). (M.B., Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 208).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Creator of the pracetases.%} The sage Prācīnabarhis was
<div n="lb"/>born in the family of Atri Maharṣi. Ten Pracetases
<div n="lb"/>(Prajāpatis) were born as the sons of this Muni. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Śakti Parva, Chapter 208).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Citra Śikhaṇḍī.%} Among the seven Munis known as
<div n="lb"/>Citra Śikhaṇḍīs, we see Atri Maharṣi as one of the
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭaprakṛtis which form the basis of the Universe.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Important events.%} (1) {%How Mahāviṣṇu became Atri's son.%}
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa had a son named Kaśipu. He was a very mighty
<div n="lb"/>ruler and carried on his reign in an ungodly manner.
<div n="lb"/>In a terrible battle which took place at that time between
<div n="lb"/>the Devas and Asuras Kaśipu was killed. Prahlāda be-
[Page074-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>came the Asura King. Then there was a battle between
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Prahlāda. After six years' war, Prahlāda with-
<div n="lb"/>drew, defeated. Later Mahābali, the son of Virocana
<div n="lb"/>(grandson of Prahlāda) became emperor of Asuras. War
<div n="lb"/>broke out again between Mahābali and Indra. In this
<div n="lb"/>war, Mahāviṣṇu helped Indra. The Asuras were utterly
<div n="lb"/>defeated. They sought refuge with Śukra, the Asura guru.
<div n="lb"/>Śukra promised to help them. He set out to the Himā-
<div n="lb"/>layas to receive a powerful mantra from Śiva. The
<div n="lb"/>Asuras kept waiting for Śukra's return.
<div n="NI"/>At this stage, Mahāviṣṇu who was the protector of Indra,
<div n="lb"/>came to Śukra's āśrama and killed Śukra's mother,
<div n="lb"/>Kāvyamātā. Seeing this impudence of Mahāviṣṇu, Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi was enraged and cursed him that he should be
<div n="lb"/>born many times in human wombs. It is on account of
<div n="lb"/>this that Mahāviṣṇu had to take many avatāras (incar-
<div n="lb"/>nations). It was in this way that Mahāviṣṇu incarnated
<div n="lb"/>as Dattātreya, the son of Atri. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Atri and Parāśara.%} It was a time when Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra were in a state of mutual ill-will. Once King
<div n="lb"/>Kalmāṣapāda was going about in the forest on a hunting
<div n="lb"/>expedition. He met Śakti, the eldest son of Vasiṣṭha in
<div n="lb"/>the forest. The King did not respect him properly. Śakti
<div n="lb"/>transformed Kalmāṣapāda into a Rākṣasa by his curse.
<div n="lb"/>The Rākṣasa who was also a cannibal, first swallowed
<div n="lb"/>Śakti himself. Viśvāmitra offered whatever help he
<div n="lb"/>could, to destroy Vasiṣṭha's family. Kalmāṣapāda ate
<div n="lb"/>successively all the 100 sons of Vasiṣṭha. Vasiṣṭha, in great
<div n="lb"/>sorrow and Sakti's wife, Adṛśyantī lived in an āśrama.
<div n="lb"/>Adṛśyantī was pregnant at the time of Śakti's death.
<div n="lb"/>In due course she gave birth to a boy who was called
<div n="lb"/>Parāśara and who later on became the father of Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>when Parāśara grew up, he came to know that his father
<div n="lb"/>Śakti was eaten by the Rākṣasa. Enraged at this, he
<div n="lb"/>started a yajña to annihilate the whole race of Rākṣasas.
<div n="lb"/>As the yajña gained intensity and force Atri Muni arrived
<div n="lb"/>there with certain other Maharṣis and dissuaded Parā-
<div n="lb"/>śara from the yajña. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 181).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Atri's dispute with Vainya.%} Atri Maharṣi and his
<div n="lb"/>wife once got ready to go for Vanavāsa. At that time the
<div n="lb"/>poor Maharṣi's wife was in great distress because they
<div n="lb"/>had no money to be distributed to their disciples and
<div n="lb"/>children. She requested her husband to go to King
<div n="lb"/>Vainya and to beg for some money. Accordingly the
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi visited King Vainya at his yāgaśālā (The shed
<div n="lb"/>where a yāga is held). He began to flatter Vainya by say-
<div n="lb"/>ing that he was the first among kings and so on. Vainya
<div n="lb"/>did not like it. He began to dispute with Atri. Vainya
<div n="lb"/>remarked that Indra was the first King. To settle the
<div n="lb"/>dispute they went together to Sanatkumāra Muni.
<div n="lb"/>Sanatkumāra sent them away reconciled. After that
<div n="lb"/>Vainya gave Atri much wealth. After distributing all this
<div n="lb"/>wealth among their sons and disciples Atri and his wife
<div n="lb"/>set out to the forest to perform penance.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%How Atri became Sun and Moon.%} Once there was
<div n="lb"/>a fierce battle between Devas and Asuras. Owing to the
<div n="lb"/>shower of arrows from the Asuras, the Sun and Moon
<div n="lb"/>became dim. Darkness spread everywhere. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>began to grope in the dark. They requested Atri Maha-
<div n="lb"/>rṣi to find a remedy for this. Moved by their distress,
<div n="lb"/>Atri suddenly transformed himself into the Sun and
<div n="lb"/>Moon. The Moon gave light to the Devas. The Sun
<div n="lb"/>burnt up the Asuras by his intense heat. Thus the
<div n="lb"/>Devas were saved. This story was told by Vāyu Bhaga-
[Page075-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>vana, to Arjuna. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 156).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Atri and King Vṛṣādarbhi.%} In the Mahābhārata we
<div n="lb"/>find a story about a difference of opinion between
<div n="lb"/>King Vṛṣādarbhi and some Maharṣis. This story was
<div n="lb"/>told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira about the kind of per-
<div n="lb"/>sons from whom Brahmins may accept gifts. Once the
<div n="lb"/>Munis, Kaśyapa, Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Bharadvāja, Gautama,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, and Paśusakhā, with Arun-
<div n="lb"/>dhatī and Gaṇḍā, who were the wives of two Munis,
<div n="lb"/>travelled round the world. Their object was to go to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaloka. At that time there was drought in the
<div n="lb"/>world. King Vṛṣādarbhi, the son of Śibi, suggested that
<div n="lb"/>the above-mentioned Munis should be called and given
<div n="lb"/>wealth. They refused to accept it. Vṛṣādarbhi became
<div n="lb"/>angry. He performed Homa in Āhavanīyāgni and from
<div n="lb"/>the agnikuṇḍa, the Rākṣasī Yātudhānī (Kṛtyā) arose.
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣādarbhi sent Yātudhānī to destroy Atri and all
<div n="lb"/>other Munis. As Yātudhānī was guarding a lotus pond
<div n="lb"/>in the forest, the munis led by Atri happened to come
<div n="lb"/>that way. The Maharṣis were able to recognize
<div n="lb"/>Yātudhānī. They beat her with their tridaṇḍu (Trident
<div n="lb"/>or a kind of magic wand) and reduced her to ashes.
<div n="lb"/>After satisfying their hunger by eating the lotus flowers
<div n="lb"/>the Maharṣis went to Brahmaloka. (M.B., Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 93).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Atri and Śrāddha.%} There is a passage in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata in which Atri gives advice to the emperor Nimi
<div n="lb"/>who belonged to Atri's family. The story of how Śrāddha
<div n="lb"/>originated in the world which Bhīṣma had told Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra was retold by Atri. A son named Dattātreya
<div n="lb"/>was born to Atri, the son of Brahmā. Dattātreya be-
<div n="lb"/>came King. Nimi was his son. Nimi's son died after
<div n="lb"/>one thousand years. Nimi who was in deep grief at the
<div n="lb"/>death of his son, ordained a Śrāddha in memory of his
<div n="lb"/>son. On that occasion Atri Maharṣi came there and
<div n="lb"/>explained to Nimi the importance of Śrāddha. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 91, Verses 20-44)
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%How Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara (Śiva) were born%}
<div n="lb"/>{%as sons of Atri.%} There is no other woman in the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>who surpasses Śīlāvatī in her fidelity to her husband. In
<div n="lb"/>order to enable Ugraśravas, her husband, to satisfy his
<div n="lb"/>passion, she once carried him on her own shoulders to
<div n="lb"/>a prostitute's house. On the way, Māṇḍavya Muni
<div n="lb"/>pronounced a curse that Ugraśravas should die before
<div n="lb"/>sunrise. The grief-stricken Śīlāvatī pronounced a
<div n="lb"/>counter-curse that the sun should not rise on the next
<div n="lb"/>day. As the sun failed to rise, the Trimūrtis (Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Śiva), accompanied by Anasūyā, Atri's wife,
<div n="lb"/>went to Śīlāvatī. Anasūyā persuaded Śīlāvatī to with-
<div n="lb"/>draw her curse. The Trimūrtis who were happy at the
<div n="lb"/>success of their mission (of bringing about the Sunrise)
<div n="lb"/>asked Anasūyā to demand any boon she wanted. Ana-
<div n="lb"/>sūyā expressed her wish that the Trimūrtis (Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Śiva) should be born as her sons and they
<div n="lb"/>agreed.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu, under the name of Dattātreya, was born
<div n="lb"/>as the son of Anasūyā. Śiva was born to her under the
<div n="lb"/>name of Durvāsas. There is a story about it in the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>māṇḍa Purāṇa. Once Śiva got angry with the Devas.
<div n="lb"/>They began to flee for life. But Brahmā alone did not
<div n="lb"/>run away. Śiva who became more furious at this,
<div n="lb"/>pinched off one of the heads of Brahmā. Still he was
<div n="lb"/>not pacified. Pārvatī who was alarmed, approached Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and begged him to suppress his anger. At her request,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's fury was transferred and deposited in Anasūyā,
[Page075-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Atri's wife. Durvāsas is the embodiment of that element
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva's fury.
<div n="NI"/>According to the promise, Brahmā also took his birth
<div n="lb"/>as the moon from Anasūyā, the wife of Atri. (For that
<div n="lb"/>story, see PURŪRAVAS). There is a story about that
<div n="lb"/>also in the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa. Once when Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>was performing the task of creation, he experienced
<div n="lb"/>carnal passion. Sarasvatī was the offspring of that
<div n="lb"/>passion. When Brahmā saw her, he fell in love with her
<div n="lb"/>also. This made him feel angry towards Kāmadeva. He
<div n="lb"/>pronounced a curse that Kāmadeva should be burnt up
<div n="lb"/>in the fire from Śiva's eye. (This is why Kāmadeva was
<div n="lb"/>later burnt to death by Śiva). Although Kāma had
<div n="lb"/>retreated from Brahmā his passion had not been sup-
<div n="lb"/>pressed. Brahmā transferred his passion to Atri Maharṣi.
<div n="lb"/>The Maharṣi gave it to Anasūyā, his wife. Since she
<div n="lb"/>was unable to bear such a violent passion, she gave it
<div n="lb"/>back to her husband. That passion emerged from Atri's
<div n="lb"/>eye in the form of the Moon. This is why lovers experi-
<div n="lb"/>ence strong passion for each other at the time of the
<div n="lb"/>rising of the moon. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>39-43).
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Atri and Gaṅgā Devī.%} Once, while Atri Maharṣi
<div n="lb"/>was performing penance in Kāmada forest, there was
<div n="lb"/>a terrible drought in the country. At that time, his wife
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā made a Śivaliṅga of sand and offered worship
<div n="lb"/>to it. Then Atri asked her to give him a little water.
<div n="lb"/>There was no water anywhere. Suddenly Gaṅgā Devī
<div n="lb"/>appeared there and said to Anasūyā: “There will be
<div n="lb"/>a hole here. Water will come out of it in a torrent.”
<div n="NI"/>Pure water began to flow from the place pointed out
<div n="lb"/>by Gaṅgā Devī. Anasūyā begged Gaṅgā Devī to stay
<div n="lb"/>there for a month. Gaṅgā Devī agreed to do so on con-
<div n="lb"/>dition that Anasūyā would transfer her Tapaśśakti to
<div n="lb"/>her for one month.
<div n="NI"/>Atri was pleased by drinking the water. He asked Ana-
<div n="lb"/>sūyā where she got such nice fresh water. She explain-
<div n="lb"/>ed to him all matters. Atri expressed his desire to see
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā Devī. She appeared before him at once. Ana-
<div n="lb"/>sūyā prayed to her that Gaṅgā should continue to exist
<div n="lb"/>in the world always. Gaṅgā Devī answered that she
<div n="lb"/>would do so if Anasūyā was prepared to give her the
<div n="lb"/>fruit of one year's Tapaśśakti and of devoted service to
<div n="lb"/>her husband. Anasūyā agreed to that condition. Sud-
<div n="lb"/>denly Śiva appeared there in the shape of a Liṅga. At
<div n="lb"/>the request of Atri and Anasūyā Śiva took his seat
<div n="lb"/>there permanently assuming the name of “Atrīśvara”.
<div n="lb"/>(Śiva Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Other Details.%} 1. Besides Dattātreya, Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>and Candra. Atri had another son, Prācīnabarhis.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapter 208, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>2. Many Pāvakas had been born in Atri Vaṃśa. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verses 27-29).
<div n="NI"/>3. When the Kaurava-Pāṇḍava war was raging with
<div n="lb"/>great fury, many Maharṣis went to Droṇa and advised
<div n="lb"/>him to stop the battle. Atri Maharṣi was one of them.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Droṇa Parva, Chapter 190, Verse 35).
<div n="NI"/>4. On another occasion, a King named Soma performed
<div n="lb"/>a Rājasūya (Royal sacrifice). Atri Maharṣi was the
<div n="lb"/>chief priest at this yāga. (M.B., Śalya Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>43, Verse 47).
<div n="NI"/>5. Atri was also among the Maharṣis who had gone to
<div n="lb"/>witness Paraśurāma's tapas. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 64).
[Page076-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>6. Ṛgveda, 5th Maṇḍala was composed by Atri. (Ṛgveda
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā, Preface).
<div n="NI"/>7. Once the Asuras put Atri Maharṣi into the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>dvāra yantra (a machine of torture with a hundred
<div n="lb"/>holes). Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka, Sūkta
<div n="lb"/>51).
<div n="NI"/>8. Once the Asuras tried to burn Atri alive. (Ṛgveda,
<div n="lb"/>1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka, Sūkta 112).
<div n="NI"/>9. The Asuras at another time made Atri lie down
<div n="lb"/>in a machine with a large number of holes and tried
<div n="lb"/>to burn him alive in it. At that time he prayed to the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvins and they liberated him. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala,
<div n="lb"/>17th Anuvāka, Sūkta 116).
<div n="NI"/>10. Atri was among the Maharṣis who visited Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, on his return to Ayodhyā after the war with
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>11. From the navel lotus of Viṣṇu Brahmā was born,
<div n="lb"/>Atri from Brahmā, Soma from Atri, and Purūravas from
<div n="lb"/>Soma were born. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>12. Atri begot by Anasūyā, Soma, Durvāsas and Dattā-
<div n="lb"/>treya yogī. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20).
