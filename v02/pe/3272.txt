KAPILA I¦. A fierce sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Kapila was the son of Kardama-
<div n="lb"/>prajāpati, son of Brahmā, born to him of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Devahūti, grand-daughter of Brahmā and daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva Manu.
<div n="NI"/>Svāyambhuva Manu got two sons named Priyavrata and
<div n="lb"/>Uttānapāda and three daughters named Ākūti, Deva-
<div n="lb"/>hūti and Prasūti. The daughters were married to Ruci,
<div n="lb"/>Kardama and Dakṣa respectively. To Ruci was born of
<div n="lb"/>Ākūti a boy named Yajña. He was a partial incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu. To Kardama was born of his wife Devahūti
<div n="lb"/>Kapilācārya, a great sage and the celebrated exponent
<div n="lb"/>of the Sāṅkhya philosophy. Prasūti got many daughters
<div n="lb"/>(8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Sage Kapila was known as Cakradhanus also. (Śloka 17
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 109, Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Kardama married the daughter of Vaivasvata Manu
<div n="lb"/>called Devahūti. They spent their honeymoon in the
<div n="lb"/>air travelling throughout the world. Devahūti delivered
<div n="lb"/>nine daughters and a son named Kapila. Kardamapra-
<div n="lb"/>jāpati gave his daughters in marriage to Marīci and the
<div n="lb"/>other sages.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kapila—incarnation of Viṣṇu.%} The Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa states that Kapila was the incarnation of Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>In Chapter 93 there is this statement: “Bhagavān
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa will protect us all. The Lord of the universe
<div n="lb"/>has now been born in the world as Kapilācārya.”
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kapila imparts spiritual knowledge to his mother.%} Kapila
<div n="lb"/>started a severe penance. At that time Kardamapra-
<div n="lb"/>jāpati died and Devahūti wife of Kardama and mother
<div n="lb"/>of Kapila approached Kapila and asked him to instruct
<div n="lb"/>her on the path of Bhakti Yoga. Kapila imparted to her
<div n="lb"/>spiritual knowledge and gave her instructions to follow
<div n="lb"/>the path of Bhakti Yoga for Salvation. She entered into
<div n="lb"/>a life of austerities and attained Samādhi. (3rd Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Kapila burnt to ashes the Sagarputras.%} Once there
<div n="lb"/>was a king called Sagara in the Solar dynasty. He had
<div n="lb"/>two wives named Keśinī and Sumati. Keśinī got a son
<div n="lb"/>named Asamañjasa and Sumati got sixtythousand sons.
<div n="lb"/>Once Sagara conducted an Aśvamedha Yāga at a place
<div n="lb"/>where the rivers Sindhu and Gaṅgā meet. Aṃśumān,
<div n="lb"/>son of Asamañjasa led the sacrificial horse. Indra dis-
<div n="lb"/>guised as a demon stole the horse when it came to a
<div n="lb"/>mountain side and hid it in the nether worlds.
<div n="NI"/>Sagara sent his sixtythousand sons in search of the horse.
<div n="lb"/>They dug the whole continent of Jambūdvīpa surround-
<div n="lb"/>ed by mountains. Devas, gandharvas and bhujaṅgas
<div n="lb"/>complained to Brahmā. Then Brahmā said: “The whole
<div n="lb"/>of this world belongs to Viṣṇu. He has incarnated him-
<div n="lb"/>self as sage Kapila to kill the sons of Sagara and is
<div n="lb"/>now in the nether-world bearing this world. In the fire
<div n="lb"/>of his anger the Sagaraputras will be burnt to death”.
<div n="lb"/>On hearing this all of them came back.
[Page388-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>The Sagaraputras returned to their father when they
<div n="lb"/>could not find the horse. But Sagara ordered “Go and
<div n="lb"/>dig again till you find it”. They went to the nether
<div n="lb"/>world. After circling the eight elephants who carry the
<div n="lb"/>world they dropped down to the nether world through
<div n="lb"/>the north-east corner of the earth. There they saw sage
<div n="lb"/>Kapila engaged in penance and the sacrificial horse
<div n="lb"/>grazing by his side. The sons of Sagara made a great
<div n="lb"/>hubbub there and Kapila produced a big sound of
<div n="lb"/>rebuke and stared at them. All the sixtythousand sons
<div n="lb"/>of Sagara were reduced to ashes. For more details see
<div n="lb"/>under Bhagīratha. (Sargas 39 and 40, Bālakāṇḍa.
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kapilayogaśāstra.%} Kapila made the renowned Kapila-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra sitting in his Āśrama and taught it to his mother
<div n="lb"/>Devahūti. Kapila was a great yogin. The yoga Śāstra
<div n="lb"/>itself is based on the Sāṅkhya philosophy of Kapila. His
<div n="lb"/>Sāṅkhya Śāstra, known as Kāpila Śāstra also, contains
<div n="lb"/>the distinctive yoga of meditation and it creates in you
<div n="lb"/>spiritual knowledge removing your ignorance totally.
<div n="lb"/>After teaching his mother his ‘Kāpila’ he went to the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama of Pulaha and lived there. (8th Skandha, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details regarding Kapila.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kapila was the preceptor of the King of Sindhu.
<div n="lb"/>5th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kapila visited Bhīṣma while the latter was lying
<div n="lb"/>on his bed of arrows before his death. (Śloka 8, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) There occurred a discussion once between Kapila
<div n="lb"/>and a Sage named ‘Gau’ on the subject whether Gṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>thadharma (doing one's duty as a house-holder) or
<div n="lb"/>yogadharma (doing yoga practices) was superior.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 286, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Kapila was a sage of great brilliance of body.
<div n="lb"/>When the sons of Sagara went to the nether world in
<div n="lb"/>search of the horse they saw the sage Kapila sitting
<div n="lb"/>there radiating a brightness equal to that of fire. (Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 107, Araṇya Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Kapila was an authority on Sāṅkhya and Veda
<div n="lb"/>and was a worshipper of Śiva. (Śloka 4, Chapter 18,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) He has written two books, namely, Sāṅkhyapra-
<div n="lb"/>vacana and Tattvasamāsa.
