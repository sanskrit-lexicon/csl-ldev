mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 67,
Stanza 45, that this King was the rebirth of Krodha-
hantā, an asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Ikṣvāku had one hundred sons. Of them
Vikukṣi, Nimi and Daṇḍa were famous. Daṇḍa became
a famous archer when he grew up. In the Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa mention is made that this King Daṇḍa took
part in the Devāsura battle (Battle between the gods
and the demons) and killed several thousand asuras
(demons).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Administration.%} The king Ikṣvāku gave his son
Daṇḍa the country between the mountains Himālaya
and Vindhya and anointed him the King of that coun-
try. Daṇḍa built a capital city known as Madhumatta
and began to rule the country. He had an army of
Caturaṅga (four parts, elephant, chariot, horse and
infantry). The hermit Śamana was the priest of King
Daṇḍa. (Uttararāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The origin of Daṇḍakāranya (the forest of Daṇḍaka).%}
Daṇḍa once raped Arā, the daughter of hermit Śukra,
who had been doing penance in a forest in the middle
of the country of Daṇḍa. Śukra the hermit got angry and
destroyed the country of Daṇḍa by a shower of fire.
From that day onwards that country was known as
Daṇḍakāraṇya. (For further information see under
Arā).
