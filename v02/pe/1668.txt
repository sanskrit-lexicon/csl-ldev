DAKṢA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Two Dakṣas.%} In most of the Purāṇas references
<div n="lb"/>about two Dakṣas occur. In some purāṇas both are
<div n="lb"/>referred to as one and the same person, whereas in
<div n="lb"/>some others both are considered as separate persons,
<div n="lb"/>so much so the stories concerning both are interlocked
<div n="lb"/>and entangled very often. The fact is that there was
<div n="lb"/>only one Dakṣa, whose life was of two stages. The first
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa was killed at the sacrifice of Dakṣa, at which point,
<div n="lb"/>ends the first stage, or the first Dakṣa. The second stage
<div n="lb"/>was the rebirth of the same Dakṣa. A short biography
<div n="lb"/>of Dakṣa including both stages is given below:—
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā created by his mind, the seven great hermits,
<div n="lb"/>Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha and
<div n="lb"/>Kratu. So these seven hermits are called the Mānasa-
<div n="lb"/>putras (sons born from mind) of Brahmā. After this,
<div n="lb"/>from the anger of Brahmā, Rudra was born, and from
<div n="lb"/>his lap Nārada, from his right thumb Dakṣa, from
<div n="lb"/>his mind the Sanakas and from his left thumb a daughter
<div n="lb"/>named Vīraṇī were born.
<Poem>Vīraṇī nāma tasyā stu
<div n="lb"/>asiknītyāpi sattamā</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>From this passage which occurs in Kālikā Purāṇa it
<div n="lb"/>may be assumed that ‘Asiknī’ was another name of
<div n="lb"/>Vīraṇī. Dakṣa did penance in the mountain of Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>for a long time. It is mentioned in Bhāgavata, Skandha
<div n="lb"/>8, that Mahāviṣṇu appeared before Dakṣa and gave
<div n="lb"/>him Asiknī as his wife.
<div n="NI"/>Several sons were born to Dakṣa by his wife Asiknī.
<div n="lb"/>The last one was a daughter named Satī who became
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Śiva. At this time Dakṣa performed a sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>As he was not invited to that sacrifice, Śiva sent
<div n="lb"/>Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī and killed Dakṣa. Though
<div n="lb"/>the devas put the head of a goat in place of the lost
<div n="lb"/>head and brought Dakṣa to life again, no reference
<div n="lb"/>is made about the life of Dakṣa after the sacrifice. Thus
<div n="lb"/>the first stage of the life of Dakṣa ends. (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>After this, once the Pracetases (the ten sons of Barhis)
<div n="lb"/>were engaged in penance and the earth was not pro-
<div n="lb"/>perly cultivated in consequence of which big trees
[Page193-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>grew up and the whole of the earth was changed into
<div n="lb"/>a big forest. The sky was covered with tree tops. It
<div n="lb"/>was difficult even for the wind to pass through them
<div n="lb"/>and thus the forest thrived for ten thousand years. The
<div n="lb"/>pracetases got out of the sea after penance and entered
<div n="lb"/>the shore. When they saw the big forest they got angry
<div n="lb"/>and the ten of them discharged fire and wind from
<div n="lb"/>their faces. The wind up-rooted the trees and the fire
<div n="lb"/>dried them. Thus almost the whole of the trees were
<div n="lb"/>consumed. Then Candra, the King of the medicinal
<div n="lb"/>herbs came there and told the Pracetases “Oh, Kings,
<div n="lb"/>hold your anger. I will make the trees conclude a
<div n="lb"/>treaty with you. The beautiful Māriṣā who was born
<div n="lb"/>to the trees is my foster-daughter. I give her to you
<div n="lb"/>as your wife. From half the portion of your minds
<div n="lb"/>and half the portion of my mind the great and wise
<div n="lb"/>prajāpati Dakṣa is going to take birth in her womb”.
<div n="NI"/>The Pracetases controlled their anger and accepted
<div n="lb"/>Māriṣā as their wife, at the words of Somadeva (Candra)
<div n="lb"/>and as the son of the ten pracetases the Prajāpati Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>was born. With this the second stage of the life of Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>begins. The important occurrences in the two stages
<div n="lb"/>of the life of Dakṣa are given below in their order.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Dakṣa's creation of the prajas or subjects.%} Once Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>called Dakṣa and ordered him to create prajās or sub-
<div n="lb"/>jects. Accordingly Dakṣa created the gods, the hermits,
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharvas (Demi-gods), the Asuras, the serpents
<div n="lb"/>etc. Seeing that the subjects he created were not pro-
<div n="lb"/>liferating as required he thought of creating subjects
<div n="lb"/>by coition of male and female; and he begot by his
<div n="lb"/>wife Asiknī five thousand sons, and they were called
<div n="lb"/>Haryaśvas. They in their turn were about to create
<div n="lb"/>subjects when Nārada appeared before them and said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, Haryaśvas, you are mere children and ignorant
<div n="lb"/>of the secrets of this world. How do you intend to
<div n="lb"/>create subjects? You fools, since you have the power
<div n="lb"/>to go up and down and lengthwise and breadthwise,
<div n="lb"/>why don't you try to find out the extremities of the
<div n="lb"/>earth?” Hearing the words of Nārada, they all ran
<div n="lb"/>in different directions and have not returned since.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Dakṣa lost the Haryaśvas. Dakṣa again begot
<div n="lb"/>thousand sons by Asiknī and they were called Śabalāśvas.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing that they also were about to create subjects
<div n="lb"/>Nārada scattered them also, by some tricks. The
<div n="lb"/>Śabalāśvas who had gone to see the end of the earth
<div n="lb"/>have not yet returned.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa got angry with Nārada and cursed him thus:
<div n="lb"/>“You also, like my children shall wander from place
<div n="lb"/>to place all over the earth”. From that dry onwards
<div n="lb"/>Nārada became a wanderer, without a fixed dwelling
<div n="lb"/>place. The wise Prajāpati Dakṣa again begot sixty
<div n="lb"/>damsels by Asiknī. Ten of the girls were given to Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>deva, thirteen of them to Kaśyapa, twentyseven of
<div n="lb"/>them to Soma, and four of them to Ariṣṭanemi. Of
<div n="lb"/>the rest two were given to Bāhuputra, two to Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>and two to the wise Kṛśāśva. The names of the wives
<div n="lb"/>of each are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Kaśyapa.%} Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ariṣṭā, Surasā, Khasā,
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi, Vinatā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Irā, Kadrū,
<div n="lb"/>Muni.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Dharmadeva.%} Arundhatī, Vasu, Yamī, Laṃbā,
<div n="lb"/>Bhānu, Marutvatī, Saṅkalpā, Muhūrtā, Sādhyā,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvā.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Soma.%} Aśvayuk, Bharaṇi, Kṛttikā, Rohiṇī, Mrga-
<div n="lb"/>śiras, Tārakam (Ardrā), Punarvasu, Puṣyam, Āśle-
[Page193-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>ṣam, Janakam, Phālgunī, Uttaraphālgunam, Hastam,
<div n="lb"/>Citrā, Svātī, Viśākham, Anurādhā, Jyeṣṭhā, Mūlam,
<div n="lb"/>Purvāṣāḍham, Uttarāṣāḍham, Śroṇa, Śraviṣṭhā, Pracetas,
<div n="lb"/>Purvaproṣṭhapadam, Uttaraproṣṭhapadam, Revatī.
<div n="NI"/>The names of the wives given to Aṅgiras, Ariṣṭanemi,
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuputra and Kṛśāśva are not mentioned.
<div n="NI"/>Besides these damsels, twentyfour daughters were born
<div n="lb"/>to Dakṣa of his wife Prasūti who was the sister of Uttāna-
<div n="lb"/>pāda. Dharmadeva married thirteen of them also, named
<div n="lb"/>Śraddhā, Lakṣmī, Dhṛti, Tuṣṭi, Medhā, Puṣṭi, Kriyā,
<div n="lb"/>Buddhi, Lajjā, Vapus, Śānti, Siddhi, Kīrti. Of the rest,
<div n="lb"/>Khyāti was given to Bhṛgu, Satī to Śiva, Saṃbhūti to
<div n="lb"/>Marīci, Smṛti to Aṅgiras, Prīti to Pulastya, Kṣamā
<div n="lb"/>to Pulaha, Santati to Kratu, Anasūyā to Atri, Ūrjā
<div n="lb"/>to Vasiṣṭha, Svāhā to Agnideva and Svadhā to the
<div n="lb"/>Manes. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sacrifice of Dakṣa.%} Once Dakṣa performed a sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice called Bṛhaspatisavana. To this sacrifice he did not
<div n="lb"/>invite his daughter Satī or her husband Śiva. Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>did not invite them because of three reasons according
<div n="lb"/>to the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once Durvāsas, the son of Atri, went to Jambūnada
<div n="lb"/>and meditated with the mantra or spell of ‘Māyābīja’
<div n="lb"/>and worshipped Jagadambikā (mother of the
<div n="lb"/>world) the goddess there. The goddess was much plea-
<div n="lb"/>sed and gave him as a token of her pleasure the garland
<div n="lb"/>of flowers she wore from which nectar was oozing.
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas wore it on his head and went to the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa, the Prajāpati. When he saw such a wonderful
<div n="lb"/>garland which was not of this world, he wanted to have
<div n="lb"/>it and Durvāsas instantly gave it to Dakṣa. He placed it in
<div n="lb"/>a prominent place in his bedroom and enjoying the
<div n="lb"/>wonderful fragrance of it he conjugated with his wife,
<div n="lb"/>and polluted that pure garland by his lust. Śiva and his
<div n="lb"/>wife came to know of this and they scolded Dakṣa, who
<div n="lb"/>kept this bitterness in his heart and when the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>was performed, he decided not to invite them. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Śiva was considered as a polluted man by Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>as he had always been carrying with him the skull of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and so he thought it wrong on his part to admit
<div n="lb"/>his daughter and son-in-law to the sacrificial hall. The
<div n="lb"/>story of how Śiva came to have the skull, is given below.
<div n="NI"/>In days of old when the whole world was under the
<div n="lb"/>single ocean (of the great flood) the sun, the moon, the
<div n="lb"/>fire, air everything was destroyed and darkness pre-
<div n="lb"/>vailed. All the vegetations were destroyed. All the
<div n="lb"/>emotions and non-emotions disappeared. The supreme
<div n="lb"/>Lord was sleeping for so many thousands of nights
<div n="lb"/>together. At the end of the night he assumed the attri-
<div n="lb"/>bute of ‘Rajoguṇa’ (activity) and got ready to create
<div n="lb"/>the universe. From the face of the Supreme Lord and
<div n="lb"/>creator of the universes came out Brahmā with five faces.
<div n="lb"/>In the same way, Śiva with three eyes and matted hair,
<div n="lb"/>and trident and rosary of beads (Elaeo carpus) and with
<div n="lb"/>attribute of ‘Tamas’ (darkness—destruction) also came
<div n="lb"/>out. Both Brahmā and Śiva were filled with egoism and
<div n="lb"/>both began to quarrel with each other. It was a contest
<div n="lb"/>as to who was greater. The contest ended in attack.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva plucked off the fifth head of Brahmā, when the
<div n="lb"/>same face, flushed with anger, scolded Śiva. The head
<div n="lb"/>fell into the hands of Śiva, who could not throw it down
<div n="lb"/>as it didn't come off from his hand. Brahmā cursed
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and made him polluted. Since Śiva became polluted,
[Page194-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>his wife Satī also was considered as polluted by Dakṣa.
<div n="lb"/>(Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Once the prajāpatis performed a sacrifice. Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Śiva were present there. Dakṣa, who had been
<div n="lb"/>invited by the prajāpatis also was present. When Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>entered the hall his son-in-law Śiva did not rise up.
<div n="lb"/>This arrogance of Śiva made Dakṣa angry. Dakṣa made
<div n="lb"/>up his mind to take vengeance on Śiva, and performed
<div n="lb"/>a sacrifice known as Bṛhaspatisavana. To that sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>he did not invite Śiva or Satī.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that her father was conducting a sacrifice Satī
<div n="lb"/>came uninvited. But Dakṣa did not even look at her.
<div n="lb"/>Satīdevi whose heart was broken at this treatment made
<div n="lb"/>a fire and jumped into it and died. Śiva became furious
<div n="lb"/>when he came to know of this. Being overwhelmed with
<div n="lb"/>sorrow and anger he beat his matted hair on the ground,
<div n="lb"/>from which two monsters, Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī,
<div n="lb"/>came out. They ran to Dakṣa's sacrificial hall and des-
<div n="lb"/>troyed everything they saw, killed everybody, caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of Dakṣa and cut off his head. Then they began to
<div n="lb"/>create havoc in the whole world. The hermits and
<div n="lb"/>sages began to take to flight. Men and animals shivered.
<div n="lb"/>Thus the three worlds began to tremble with fear. The
<div n="lb"/>gods approached Śiva with supplication to curb his
<div n="lb"/>anger. The gracious Śaṅkara was pleased to recall the
<div n="lb"/>monsters. After that everybody requested him to bring
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa back to life. But the search made for the head of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa was futile. At last Brahmā took the head of a
<div n="lb"/>goat and joined it to the headless trunk of Dakṣa. Thus
<div n="lb"/>he was brought to life again.
<F>1. Though Dakṣa was brought to life again with the head of a goat there is no mention of him again in the Purāṇas. We hear of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa again as the son of Māriṣā.</F> (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Cursing Candra.%} Candra had married twentyseven
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Dakṣa. But he showed particular attach-
<div n="lb"/>ment to Rohiṇī. The other twentysix wives could not
<div n="lb"/>bear this. They made a complaint to their father Dakṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa called Candra and advised him to show equal
<div n="lb"/>attachment to all his wives and not to show any partia-
<div n="lb"/>lity to anyone. Candra did not gainsay his father-in-
<div n="lb"/>law, but he did not make any change in his disposition.
<div n="lb"/>After a few days all the daughters except Rohiṇi went
<div n="lb"/>to the palace of Dakṣa and told him that they were
<div n="lb"/>going to stay with him. This time Dakṣa got angry and
<div n="lb"/>called Candra and cursed him to become a sick man
<div n="lb"/>(of consumption).
<div n="NI"/>From that day onwards Candra became a patient affec-
<div n="lb"/>ted with consumption. All the vegetations in the world
<div n="lb"/>began to weaken. It appeared that the world was
<div n="lb"/>about to be destroyed. So the gods approached Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>and requested him to show some leniency towards
<div n="lb"/>Candra. Dakṣa accordingly called Candra and told
<div n="lb"/>him that he would be affected by consumption only for a
<div n="lb"/>fortnight and after that he would recover gradually.
<div n="lb"/>Candra went to Prabhāsa tīrtha and Sarasvatī tīrtha and
<div n="lb"/>dipped in water. He began to recover from that day.
<div n="lb"/>It is according to the curse of Daksa that Candra (Moon)
<div n="lb"/>waxes and wanes. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 35).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Dakṣa has another name ‘Kan’.
<div n="lb"/>“Dakṣa the Prajāpati is a son of ten fathers. He has
<div n="lb"/>two names. They are Dakṣa and Kan.” (M.B. Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 208, Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When the emperor Pṛthu milked the earth, Dakṣa
[Page194-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>was crowned as the King of the subjects. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>(3) It occurs in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>11, Stanza 18, that Dakṣa was a member of the assembly
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Dakṣa was one of those who visited Bhīṣma in his
<div n="lb"/>bed of arrows. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 47).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 166 that the devas, the manes, the gandharvas,
<div n="lb"/>the celestial maids, the Rākṣasas, animals and birds,
<div n="lb"/>fishes and all living creatures were born from the daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ters of Dakṣa.
