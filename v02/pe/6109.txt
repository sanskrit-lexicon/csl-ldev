SAṂVAHA¦. A wind which moves the aerial chariots of
<div n="lb"/>the Devas. According to Vyāsa there are seven winds.
<div n="lb"/>While once he was teaching his son Śuka Vedas, a
<div n="lb"/>storm blew and the teaching had to be stopped for
<div n="lb"/>some time. Then Śuka asked his father about winds,
<div n="lb"/>and Vyāsa answered as follows:
<div n="NI"/>There are seven vāyus (winds). The first one called
<div n="lb"/>Pravaha moves the clouds. The second one, Āvaha,
<div n="lb"/>causes thunder while the third vāyu, Udvaha, converts
<div n="lb"/>sea-water into vapour and causes rain. The fourth
<div n="lb"/>one Saṃvaha moves clouds in the sky. The clouds are
<div n="lb"/>the aeroplanes of the Devas. The fifth is Vivaha, which
<div n="lb"/>gives form and shape to the clouds. The sixth Vāyu,
<div n="lb"/>Parivaha, keeps Ākāśagaṅgā motionless while due to
<div n="lb"/>the action of the seventh Vāyu, Parāvaha, the souls
<div n="lb"/>travel. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 329).
