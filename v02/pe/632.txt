AURVA II¦. A brahmin living in the country of Mālava.
<div n="lb"/>This brahmin got a daughter named Śamīka by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Sumedha. She was married very early to Mandāra, son
<div n="lb"/>of Dhaumyaka and disciple of Śaunaka. After some
<div n="lb"/>days when Mandāra found his wife fully grown he went
<div n="lb"/>to Aurva to bring his wife home. Aurva sent them both
<div n="lb"/>to the house of Mandāra with his blessings. On their
<div n="lb"/>way home they met the Maharṣi Bhuśuṇḍi and burst
<div n="lb"/>into laughter at his sight. The sage cursed them and
[Page077-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>made them into two trees. When Aurva found his
<div n="lb"/>daughter and son-in-law missing he started a search for
<div n="lb"/>them. Then he came to know that both of them had
<div n="lb"/>changed into trees by a curse. Aurva and his wife then
<div n="lb"/>prayed to God for help. Aurva then lived in the tree
<div n="lb"/>of Śamā in the shape of Agni and Śaunaka made an
<div n="lb"/>idol of Gaṇapati with the root of the Mandāra tree and
<div n="lb"/>worshipped him. Gaṇapati was pleased by the devotional
<div n="lb"/>deeds of Aurva and Śaunaka and changed the trees
<div n="lb"/>again into Śamīka and Mandāra. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa).
