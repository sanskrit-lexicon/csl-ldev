BHṚGU¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A sage, the son of Brahmā. He was the
<div n="lb"/>founder of Bhṛgu vaṃśa. Members of the Bhṛgu vaṃśa
<div n="lb"/>are called ‘Bhārgavas.’ Bhṛguvaṃśa has been reputed
<div n="lb"/>for many of its members who were Ṛṣis of great sanctity
<div n="lb"/>and grandeur.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%}
<Poem>“Utsaṃgād Nārado jajñe
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣo 'ṃguṣṭhāt svayaṃbhuvaḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Prāṇādvasiṣṭhaḥ saṃjāto
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgustvacaḥ karātkratuḥ”.
<F>*) Nārada was born from Brahmā's lap, Dakṣa from his Aṃguṣṭha, Vasiṣṭha from his Prāṇa, Bhṛgu from his skin and Kṛatu from his arm.</F> //</Poem>
[Page139-b+ 55]
<div n="NI"/>From these lines we see that Bhṛgu was born from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's skin (tvak). But in M.B. Ādi Parva, 5th
<div n="lb"/>Chapter, we find another version regarding his birth.
<div n="lb"/>In that passage we read that Bhṛgu was born from
<div n="lb"/>“Vahni” (fire). In the light of these two statements, we
<div n="lb"/>may examine Bhṛgu's birth.
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgu had two incarnations. The first time he was born
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmā's skin. In course of time, the sage Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>became famous. In the Dakṣayāga, this sage was pre-
<div n="lb"/>sent as one of the Ṛtviks (officiating priests). On that
<div n="lb"/>occasion, Satīdevī who was in rage and grief because
<div n="lb"/>her husband (Śiva) was not invited to the yāga, commit-
<div n="lb"/>ted suicide by jumping into the sacrificial fire. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>about this, Śiva was enraged and the monster spirits who
<div n="lb"/>emerged from his matted locks caught hold of the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtviks. Bhāgavata caturtha skandha says that the Bhūta
<div n="lb"/>named Nandīśvara, who emerged from Śiva's locks,
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of Bhṛgu and killed him.
<div n="NI"/>Therefore the Bhṛgu who was born from Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>skin must be considered as having died at Dakṣayāga.
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu was born again in Vaivasvata Manvantara.
<div n="lb"/>This second birth was at the famous Brahmayajña
<div n="lb"/>of Varuṇa. He was reborn from fire, as Brahmā's son.
<div n="lb"/>This child who was born from Brahmā's semen which
<div n="lb"/>fell in the sacrificial fire, was brought up by Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>and his wife Carṣaṇī. Consequently Bhṛgu is referred
<div n="lb"/>to as “Varuṇaputra” and “Carṣaṇīputra” in some
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas. Since he was born at Varuṇa's yāga he is
<div n="lb"/>sometimes called “Vāruṇī Bhṛgu”.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhṛgu Vaṃśa. (Bhṛgu family).%} Each birth of Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>gave rise to a separate family. They are given below
<div n="lb"/>separately:—First birth: Bhṛgu and his wife Khyāti
<div n="lb"/>had a daughter Lakṣmī and three sons, Dhātā, Vidhātā
<div n="lb"/>and Kavi. Mahāmeru's daughters, Āyati and Niyati
<div n="lb"/>became the wives of Dhātā and Vidhātā, respectively.
<div n="lb"/>Two sons, Prāṇa and Mṛkaṇḍu were born to those two
<div n="lb"/>couples. Mārkaṇḍeya was born to Mṛkaṇḍu and from
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya was born Vedaśiras. Prāṇa had a son,
<div n="lb"/>Dyutimān who had a son Rājavān. From that Rājavān,
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu Vaṃśa multiplied. The family tree of this first
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu Vaṃśa is given below:—(See Viṣṇu purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part I, Chapter 10).
<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>BRAHMĀ
<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>Bhṛgu <C n="2"/>Khyāti

<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>Dyutimān <C n="2"/>Mārkaṇḍeya
<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>Rājavān <C n="2"/>Vedaśiras
<div n="NI"/>Second Birth: The second Bhṛgu Vaṃśa is the family
<div n="lb"/>which took its origin from the second birth of Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>as the son of Varuṇa. Varuṇa's son, Bhṛgu married
<div n="lb"/>the woman, Pulomā. They had six children who were,
<div n="lb"/>Bhūta, Cyavana, Vajraśīrṣa, Śuci, Śukra, and Savana.
<div n="lb"/>By his first wife Bhūtā, he had his sons, “Ekādaśa
<div n="lb"/>Rudras” (eleven Rudras) and “Rudra Pārṣadas”
[Page140-a+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>(Attendants of Rudra) and by his second wife Sarūpā
<div n="lb"/>he had a crore of Rudras. Cyavana had two wives,
<div n="lb"/>Sukanyā and Āruṣi. Aurva, a son was born to Āruṣi.
<div n="lb"/>From Aurva was born Ṛcīka, from Ṛcīka Jamadagni
<div n="lb"/>and from Jamadagni, Paraśurāma. Cyavana had a
<div n="lb"/>son, Pravati, by his wife Sukanyā. Ruru or Śunaka was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Pravati by the Apsarā Ghṛtācī. Ruru
<div n="lb"/>and his wife Pramadvarā had a son, Śaunaka. Śuka,
<div n="lb"/>the son of Bhṛgu had two sons, Caṇḍa and Alarka and
<div n="lb"/>a daughter, Devayānī. This is the second Bhṛgu Vaṃśa.
<F>1) Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama Skandha says that Bhṛgu had married two daughters of Dakṣa. Mahābhārata Anuśāsana Parva
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 85, Verse 127 says that Bhrgu had seven sons, namely Cyavana Vajraśīla, Śuci, Aurva, Śukra, Vareṇya, and Savana.</F>

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Bhṛgu cursed Mahāviṣṇu.%} Once a terrible war broke
<div n="lb"/>out between Devas and Asuras. In that war, not only
<div n="lb"/>were the Asuras defeated but many of them were also
<div n="lb"/>killed. Diti, the mother of the Asuras, with tears in her
<div n="lb"/>eyes, complained to Bhṛgupati. Pulomā, Mother of
<div n="lb"/>Śukra, promised to find a remedy for this somehow.
<div n="lb"/>She at once went to the forest and started a tapas for
<div n="lb"/>the annihilation of the Devas. As the tapas gained
<div n="lb"/>force, the Devas were alarmed and they sought the
<div n="lb"/>protection of Mahāviṣṇu. Mahāviṣṇu used his
<div n="lb"/>Vajrāyudha (Vajra weapon) against Bhṛgu's wife,
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā. Under the stroke of Vajra she fell down, a
<div n="lb"/>headless corpse. The enraged Maharṣi Bhṛgu cursed
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu to be born as a mortal in this world and to
<div n="lb"/>suffer the pangs of separation from his wife. When the
<div n="lb"/>curse was pronounced against Mahāviṣṇu, he directed
<div n="lb"/>his weapon Cakra against the Maharṣi. Bhṛgu fied in
<div n="lb"/>panic and at last begged pardon and prayed for shelter
<div n="lb"/>to Mahāviṣṇu himself in the ocean of milk. Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>withdrew his Cakra. Bhṛgu himself restored Pulomā
<div n="lb"/>to life. To fulfil the condition of Bhṛgu's curse, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>agreed to incarnate in the world as Śrī Rāma, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Daśaratha and to experience the pain of separation
<div n="lb"/>from his wife. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Bhṛgu kicked Viṣṇu.%} Long ago all the Maharṣis
<div n="lb"/>joined together to perform a yāga on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>river Sarasvatī. A dispute arose among them as to who
<div n="lb"/>was the most mighty among the Trimūrtis. Some of
<div n="lb"/>them voted for Brahmā, others declared that Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was more mighty than the other two, while a third
<div n="lb"/>group stood for Śiva's superiority. They unanimously
<div n="lb"/>elected Bhṛgu to ascertain and find out the truth of
<div n="lb"/>the matter.
[Page140-b+ 43]
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgu set out to Devaloka. First he went to Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>assembly. There, in the presence of Brahmā who was
<div n="lb"/>seated in the midst of many Munis, Bhṛgu took his seat
<div n="lb"/>on a stool. Brahmā was provoked by this act of disres-
<div n="lb"/>pect. Bhṛgu left the place without a word and went to
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's place. Śiva rose from his seat and approached
<div n="lb"/>him to embrace and welcome him. Bhṛgu, shrank back
<div n="lb"/>saying, “Do not touch me?” Śiva became angry and
<div n="lb"/>was about to hit him with his trident when Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>stopped him.
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgu then turned his steps to Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. There he saw Mahāviṣṇu in a deep
<div n="lb"/>slumber. Seeing Mahāviṣṇu whose task is the pre-
<div n="lb"/>servation of the world, sleeping like an irresponsible
<div n="lb"/>person, Bhṛgu gave him a kick on his breast. Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>who sprang up suddenly, saw Bhṛgu standing before
<div n="lb"/>him. He begged pardon of the sage. He declared that
<div n="lb"/>he would carry Bhṛgu's footprint permanently on his
<div n="lb"/>chest as a sign of his repentance for having shown dis-
<div n="lb"/>respect to the Maharṣi. This foot-print still remains
<div n="lb"/>on Viṣṇu's chest and is known by the name “Śrīvatsa”.
<div n="lb"/>In this way, the Munis came to the conclusion that
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu is the noblest of the Trimūrtis. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Daśama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The origin of Bhṛgu Tīrtha.%} There is a sacred spot
<div n="lb"/>called, “Bhṛgu Tīrtha” on the western side of Daśāśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha. It is here that Bhṛgu once offered tapas to Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Owing to the austerity of his tapas, his hair became
<div n="lb"/>matted and discoloured. His body was completely
<div n="lb"/>covered with earth heaped up by termites. When Śiva
<div n="lb"/>was still not propitiated, Pārvatī interceded with him
<div n="lb"/>on behalf of Bhṛgu, Śiva agreed to bless Bhṛgu.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva sent his bull to the place where Bhṛgu was sitting.
<div n="lb"/>The bull in the course of its gambols broke up and des-
<div n="lb"/>troyed the earthen covering on his body which was
<div n="lb"/>made by the termites. Bhṛgu became angry and chased
<div n="lb"/>the bull. But he was stunned by the sight of the bull
<div n="lb"/>rising up to heaven through the air. A divine light
<div n="lb"/>spread there. Śiva appeared before him and asked him
<div n="lb"/>what boon he wanted. Bhṛgu prayed that the place
<div n="lb"/>where he was doing tapas should become a holy spot.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva granted his prayer and from that day, the place
<div n="lb"/>became famous under the name “Bhṛgu Tīrtha”.
[Page141-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and other Devas and the Kinnaras still worship
<div n="lb"/>this Bhṛgu Tīrtha. All sin is removed by a mere sight
<div n="lb"/>of this sacred Tīrtha. Those who bathe in the holy
<div n="lb"/>water of this place attain Heaven and they will not be
<div n="lb"/>born again. Even by hearing about the greatness and
<div n="lb"/>glory of this Bhṛgu Tīrtha, one will be cleared of all
<div n="lb"/>sins and find an easy way to Śivaloka. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 20).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%} (1) It was Bhṛgu who gave the boon
<div n="lb"/>for having progeny to Sagara, King of the solar dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>Sagara, with his two wives, Keśinī and Sumati, per-
<div n="lb"/>formed tapas at Bhṛgu prasravaṇa in the Himālayas.
<div n="lb"/>After a hundred years, Bhṛgu, who was pleased, blessed
<div n="lb"/>the king that he would have numerous children by one
<div n="lb"/>wife and one son who would be progenitor of a vaṃśa,
<div n="lb"/>by the other wife. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>38th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once when some Munis went to Dvārakā, Sāmba
<div n="lb"/>and other Yādavas mocked them and the Munis cursed
<div n="lb"/>them. Bhṛgu was one of those Munis. (See the word
<div n="lb"/>Sāmba).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Paraśurāma, after exterminating the Kṣatriya kings,
<div n="lb"/>went to the Āśrama of Bhṛgu, the founder of the family
<div n="lb"/>and received his blessings. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 62).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Bhṛgu Maharṣi was a prominent member in Yudhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭhira's assembly. (M.B. Chapter 4, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(5) He was also a member of Indra's assembly. It was
<div n="lb"/>by Bhṛgu's brilliance that Indra's glory was heightened.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 29).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Bhṛgu was a member of Brahmā's assembly also.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Once Bhṛgu blessed his son Ṛcīka and his daughter-
<div n="lb"/>in-law Satyavatī that they would have children. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 116, Verse 35).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Śrī Kṛṣṇa who went as the messenger of peace to
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura, travelled in Dakṣiṇāvarta, along with the
<div n="lb"/>sage Bhṛgu. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 83, Verse
<div n="lb"/>27).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Bhṛgu entered the scene of battle between the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>and Pāṇḍavas and tried to persuade Droṇācārya to
<div n="lb"/>withdraw from the fight. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>190, Verse 34).
<div n="NI"/>(10) Once Bhṛgu lectured on the origin of the earth,
<div n="lb"/>Philosophy of life, etc. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>128).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Bhṛgu explained to Bharadvāja how the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>bhūtas except the sky originated (Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>183).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Bhṛgu discussed in a logical manner, the principle
<div n="lb"/>of life and the transmigration of the soul. (Śāntiparva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 187).
<div n="NI"/>(13) He made a critical examination of the merits and
<div n="lb"/>defects of racial discrimination. (Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>187).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Once Bhṛgu bestowed Brahminhood on a King
<div n="lb"/>named Vītahavya. (M.B. Anuśāsana. Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>30, Verse 57).
<div n="NI"/>(15) He got the name “Bhṛgu” because he was born out
<div n="lb"/>of fire. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 105).
<div n="NI"/>(16) It was Bhṛgu who gave the necessary advice to
<div n="lb"/>Agastya to depose Nahuṣa from Indra's post.
[Page141-b+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>(17) There is a story that Nahuṣa kicked Agastya on the
<div n="lb"/>head while the latter was carrying Nahuṣa's palanquin
<div n="lb"/>and that Bhṛgu, who was hiding in Agasty's locks of
<div n="lb"/>hair, cursed Nahuṣa and changed him into a python.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 100).
