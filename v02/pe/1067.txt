BHARATA V¦. The Mahābhārata speaks about a few
other Bharatas who were sons of Agni. Śamyu is a son
of Agni known as Bharata. This Bharata has got
another name, Ūrjja. (Śloka 6, Chapter 219, Vana
Parva, M.B.). There is an Agni of name Bharata with
a son named Bhārata. When this Agni is propitiated
one gets healthy and strong and so this Agni is called
Puṣṭimān also. (Śloka 7, Chapter 219, Vana Parva,
M.B.). There is another Bharata son of an Agni
called Adbhuta. It is this Agni that burns dead bodies.
As this Agni lives permanently in Agniṣṭoma Yajñas; it
gets the name of Niyata also. (Śloka 6, Chapter 222,
Vana Parva, M.B.).
