SANAKĀDI¦ (S). Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana and
Sanatkumāra, the four Sages.
<div n="NI"/>The Sanakādis are the mental sons of Brahmā. When
they stood in the form of infants they were asked to
create subjects. But they were the incarnation of ‘Sattva’,
(the attribute of purity), and so were not prepared to
undertake creation. Even at the age of four or five the
four of them learned the Vedas, and travelled together.
They were celibates for ever. While the Sanakādis were
travelling thus one day they reached Vaikuṇṭha, and
cursed Jaya and Vijaya who showed disrespect towards
them. (See under Jayavijayas).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in some places that the Sanakādis were
the incarnations of portions of Mahāviṣṇu. Once Brahmā
praised the incarnations of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>It is clear that the Kumāras (Sanakādis) had taken
incarnation before the present Brahmā began the work
of creation. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1; Skandha 7;
Bhāgavata, Skandha 7, Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
