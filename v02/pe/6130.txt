SANAKĀDI¦ (S). Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana and
<div n="lb"/>Sanatkumāra, the four Sages.
<div n="NI"/>The Sanakādis are the mental sons of Brahmā. When
<div n="lb"/>they stood in the form of infants they were asked to
<div n="lb"/>create subjects. But they were the incarnation of ‘Sattva’,
<div n="lb"/>(the attribute of purity), and so were not prepared to
<div n="lb"/>undertake creation. Even at the age of four or five the
<div n="lb"/>four of them learned the Vedas, and travelled together.
<div n="lb"/>They were celibates for ever. While the Sanakādis were
<div n="lb"/>travelling thus one day they reached Vaikuṇṭha, and
<div n="lb"/>cursed Jaya and Vijaya who showed disrespect towards
<div n="lb"/>them. (See under Jayavijayas).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in some places that the Sanakādis were
<div n="lb"/>the incarnations of portions of Mahāviṣṇu. Once Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>praised the incarnations of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>It is clear that the Kumāras (Sanakādis) had taken
<div n="lb"/>incarnation before the present Brahmā began the work
<div n="lb"/>of creation. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1; Skandha 7;
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 7, Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
