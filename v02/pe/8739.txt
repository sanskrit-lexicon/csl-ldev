YAŚODĀ¦. Foster-mother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. How she became
Śrī Kṛṣṇa's fostermother, is explained in a story given
in Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Droṇa, one of the Aṣṭavasus, and his wife Dharā,
caused displeasure to Brahmā. In his anger, Brahmā
cursed them to be born in the world as human beings
and to spend a life-time on earth, tending cattle.
Droṇa became sad and with tears in his eyes, prayed to
Brahmā that during his life on earth he should be bless-
ed with Viṣṇu's darśana. Brahmā granted that prayer.
It was in fulfilment of this prayer that Droṇa was born
as Nandagopa and Dharā as Yaśodā in Ambāḍi.
