YAŚODĀ¦. Foster-mother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. How she became
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa's fostermother, is explained in a story given
<div n="lb"/>in Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Droṇa, one of the Aṣṭavasus, and his wife Dharā,
<div n="lb"/>caused displeasure to Brahmā. In his anger, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>cursed them to be born in the world as human beings
<div n="lb"/>and to spend a life-time on earth, tending cattle.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa became sad and with tears in his eyes, prayed to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā that during his life on earth he should be bless-
<div n="lb"/>ed with Viṣṇu's darśana. Brahmā granted that prayer.
<div n="lb"/>It was in fulfilment of this prayer that Droṇa was born
<div n="lb"/>as Nandagopa and Dharā as Yaśodā in Ambāḍi.
