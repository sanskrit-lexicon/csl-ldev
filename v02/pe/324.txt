ANILA V¦. A Kṣatriya King. His father, Vṛṣādarbhi
presented him as Dakṣiṇā to the Saptarṣis (7 sages) at
a yajña performed by him (father). The King expired
soon after this. There was then a famine in the country.
The Saptarṣis, tortured by hunger and thirst got ready
to prepare food with the corpse of the King. But the
corpse retained its form and they could not cook food
with it. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 96)
