JAṬĀYU¦. A bird famous in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu as follows,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Aruṇa—Jaṭāyu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Two sons called Sampāti and Jaṭāyu were
<div n="lb"/>born to Aruṇa. Their mother, a bird, was Śyenī. Śyenī,
<div n="lb"/>wife of Aruṇa, delivered two children, Sampāti and the
<div n="lb"/>great Jaṭāyu (Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 71).
<div n="lb"/>“Know that I am the son of Aruṇa and Sampāti is
<div n="lb"/>my elder brother. My name is Jaṭāyu, and I am the
<div n="lb"/>son of Śyenī.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyana, Canto 14, Verse
<div n="lb"/>32).
[Page351-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>But, according to Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, the name of the
<div n="lb"/>mother of Sampāti and Jaṭāyu was Mahāśvetā.
<div n="lb"/>(Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa). Perhaps, Śyenī was also known
<div n="lb"/>as Mahāśvetā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jaṭāyu flies towards Sūrya.%} Sampāti and Jaṭāyu,
<div n="lb"/>once under a bet flew up towards the sun. Jaṭāyu
<div n="lb"/>outflew Sampāti, and in the exuberance of youth
<div n="lb"/>entered Sūrya's orbit at noon time with the result that,
<div n="lb"/>due to the excessive heat his wings were scorched. At
<div n="lb"/>this Sampāti, to save his brother, flew up higher than
<div n="lb"/>Jaṭāyu and spread out his wings like an umbrella over
<div n="lb"/>Jaṭāyu with the result that Sampāti's wings were burnt,
<div n="lb"/>and he fell down somewhere on the Vindhya mountains.
<div n="lb"/>He spent the rest of his life under the protection of a
<div n="lb"/>sage called Niśākara who was performing penance on
<div n="lb"/>the mountains. After their tragic meeting in Sūrya-
<div n="lb"/>maṇḍala Sampāti and Jaṭāyu never again met in their
<div n="lb"/>life. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>58; Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Fought with Rāvaṇa.%} Jaṭāyu clashed with Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>who was carrying away Sītādevī in his vimāna, and in
<div n="lb"/>the fierce fight that they fought in the air, Rāvaṇa cut
<div n="lb"/>off Jaṭāyu's wings and thus felled him on the earth,
<div n="lb"/>almost dead. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 51).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death.%} Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa during their search
<div n="lb"/>in the forest for Sītā came upon Jaṭāyu lying without
<div n="lb"/>wings almost dead and reciting Rāma's name. Jaṭāyu
<div n="lb"/>described to Rāma how Rāvaṇa had carried away Sītā
<div n="lb"/>and how he had tried to stop him and fought with him.
<div n="lb"/>After giving this account he died. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>lit a fire and cremated Jaṭāyu. The great bird's soul
<div n="lb"/>attained salvation. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
