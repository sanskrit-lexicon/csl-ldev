JAṬĀYU¦. A bird famous in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu as follows,
Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Aruṇa—Jaṭāyu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Two sons called Sampāti and Jaṭāyu were
born to Aruṇa. Their mother, a bird, was Śyenī. Śyenī,
wife of Aruṇa, delivered two children, Sampāti and the
great Jaṭāyu (Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 71).
“Know that I am the son of Aruṇa and Sampāti is
my elder brother. My name is Jaṭāyu, and I am the
son of Śyenī.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyana, Canto 14, Verse
32).
[Page351-b+ 65]
But, according to Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, the name of the
mother of Sampāti and Jaṭāyu was Mahāśvetā.
(Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa). Perhaps, Śyenī was also known
as Mahāśvetā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jaṭāyu flies towards Sūrya.%} Sampāti and Jaṭāyu,
once under a bet flew up towards the sun. Jaṭāyu
outflew Sampāti, and in the exuberance of youth
entered Sūrya's orbit at noon time with the result that,
due to the excessive heat his wings were scorched. At
this Sampāti, to save his brother, flew up higher than
Jaṭāyu and spread out his wings like an umbrella over
Jaṭāyu with the result that Sampāti's wings were burnt,
and he fell down somewhere on the Vindhya mountains.
He spent the rest of his life under the protection of a
sage called Niśākara who was performing penance on
the mountains. After their tragic meeting in Sūrya-
maṇḍala Sampāti and Jaṭāyu never again met in their
life. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Chapter
58; Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Fought with Rāvaṇa.%} Jaṭāyu clashed with Rāvaṇa,
who was carrying away Sītādevī in his vimāna, and in
the fierce fight that they fought in the air, Rāvaṇa cut
off Jaṭāyu's wings and thus felled him on the earth,
almost dead. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa,
Chapter 51).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death.%} Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa during their search
in the forest for Sītā came upon Jaṭāyu lying without
wings almost dead and reciting Rāma's name. Jaṭāyu
described to Rāma how Rāvaṇa had carried away Sītā
and how he had tried to stop him and fought with him.
After giving this account he died. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
lit a fire and cremated Jaṭāyu. The great bird's soul
attained salvation. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
