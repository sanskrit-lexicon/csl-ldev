VIŚVAVEDĪ¦. A minister of King Śauri. This minister
<div n="lb"/>wanted the King to be just. Śauri and his four brothers
<div n="lb"/>Khanitra, Udāvasu, Sunaya and Mahāratha were the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Prajāpati. The main ruler of the kingdom was
<div n="lb"/>Khanitra. The others were Governors of the East, West
<div n="lb"/>North and South divisions of the kingdom. The four
<div n="lb"/>brothers had a priest each named Suhotra, Kuśāvarta,

<div n="lb"/>who had planned the programme, and killed all the five
<div n="lb"/>of them. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Chapter 314).
