DĀRUKA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa's charioteer.%} In the Mahābhārata, we come
across few persons who excel Dāruka in their skill as
charioteers. We find the following details about him in
the Mahābhārata:—
<div n="NI"/>1) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa fought against King Śālva, Dāruka
was over-whelmed by Śālva's arrows. (M.B. Vana Parva,
Chapter 21, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>2) At the time of the battle at Kurukṣetra, hearing the
sound of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's conch-shell, Dāruka drove his chariot
and brought it before Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
Chapter 147, Verse 45).
<div n="NI"/>3) When Sātyaki fought with Karṇa, Dāruka drove
Sātyaki's chariot. At that time he proved his extraordi-
nary skill in charioteering. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter
147, Verse 54).
<div n="NI"/>4) After being attended by Dāruka, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's chariot
horses flew up into the Heavens. (M.B. Mausala Parva,
Chapter 3, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>5) It was Dāruka who informed the Pāṇḍavas that the
Yaduvaṃśa had perished. On his return, he accompani-
ed Arjuna in his journey to Dvārakā. (M.B. Mausala
Parva, Chapter 5).
