<div n="NI"/>1) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa's charioteer.%} In the Mahābhārata, we come
<div n="lb"/>across few persons who excel Dāruka in their skill as
<div n="lb"/>charioteers. We find the following details about him in
<div n="lb"/>the Mahābhārata:—
<div n="NI"/>1) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa fought against King Śālva, Dāruka
<div n="lb"/>was over-whelmed by Śālva's arrows. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 21, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>2) At the time of the battle at Kurukṣetra, hearing the
<div n="lb"/>sound of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's conch-shell, Dāruka drove his chariot
<div n="lb"/>and brought it before Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 147, Verse 45).
<div n="NI"/>3) When Sātyaki fought with Karṇa, Dāruka drove
<div n="lb"/>Sātyaki's chariot. At that time he proved his extraordi-
<div n="lb"/>nary skill in charioteering. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>147, Verse 54).
<div n="NI"/>4) After being attended by Dāruka, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's chariot
<div n="lb"/>horses flew up into the Heavens. (M.B. Mausala Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>5) It was Dāruka who informed the Pāṇḍavas that the
<div n="lb"/>Yaduvaṃśa had perished. On his return, he accompani-
<div n="lb"/>ed Arjuna in his journey to Dvārakā. (M.B. Mausala
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 5).
