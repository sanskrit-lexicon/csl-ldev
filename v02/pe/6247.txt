SAPTAJANĀŚRAMA¦. A holy place where seven
hermits called the Saptajanas, went to heaven by
standing head downwards in water. This was the
place through which Śrī Rāma and Sugrīva went to
Kiṣkindhā. Sugrīva told Śrī Rāma about the hermitage
of Saptajanas as follows:
<div n="NI"/>“Oh! Rāghava! This vast area is the hermitage where
rest could be taken, as sweet fruits and pure water
could be obtained and the forest looks like a garden.
Here the seven hermits called Saptajanas, who did
penance and took vow and fast by standing in water
always, with heads downwards, did live in days of
old.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga
13).
