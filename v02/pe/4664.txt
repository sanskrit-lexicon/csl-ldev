NĀGALOKA¦. The world of the Nāgas or Pātāla. Vāsuki
is its chief. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 60). There
is a pond in Nāgaloka and a drink of its water bestows
the strength of a thousand elephants. (Ādi Parva,
Chapter 127, Verse 68). Pātāla is thousands of miles
away from earth. Its area exceeds a thousand yojanas,
and it is surrounded by magnificent forts studded with
gems. The steps at the entrance of the fort are also
decorated with gold and gems. There are beautiful
gardens, fountains and singing birds in Pātāla. Its outer
doors are hundred yojanas in length and five in width.
