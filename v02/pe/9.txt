ABHINAYA¦. In Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 342, Abhinaya
has been defined as follows: Abhinaya is the art of
presenting before the people the ideas that are to be
communicated to them. There are four divisions of
this art known as Sāttvika, Vācika, Āṅgika and Āhārya
depending on Sattva, Vāk, Aṅga and Āhārya. Besides
these, another division known as Abhimānika (Abhi-
mānottha) may also be mentioned. This signifies the
expression of rasas like Śṛṅgāra. There are two kinds
of Śṛṅgāra known as Saṃbhoga and Vipralambha.
Four varieties of Vipralambha called Pūrvānurāga
Vipralambha, Māna Vipralambha, Pravāsa Vipra-
lambha and Karuṇa Vipralambha are mentioned. The
union after Vipralambha is Saṃbhoga-Śṛṅgāra. All
Sāttvika bhāvas are included in Śṛṅgāra. All these have
to be expressed through Abhinaya.
