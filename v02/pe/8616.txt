VṚKṢAPRATIṢṬHĀ¦. The ancient Indians believed
that consecration of Trees and gardens (parks) were
means of remission of sins and attainment of heaven. As
the consecration of trees is a divine ritual it has to be
performed as ordained in the Vedas. The rites are given
below:
<div n="NI"/>As the first item of the consecration ceremony of a tree,
besmear it with all kinds of medicinal herbs, and adorn
it with flour and flower garlands and make it wear good
clothes. Then make on it perforations for the ears with
golden needle, and anoint ointment for eyes with golden
wire. Place on the dais prepared at the foot of each
tree, seven fruits and pots (Kalaśas) and make invoca-
tions. After this, offerings and sacrifices to Indra and
the other gods should be given. Again invocation
should be made with burnt offerings to Vanaspati. From
the middle of the trees alms of cows should be given.
Brahmins should bathe the trees with pots placed on the
dais, reciting spells and incantations of anointment, and
of Ṛg, Yajur and Sāma Vedas along with instrumental
music. The owner of the trees should be given bathing
water by himself. Then the owner should give cows,
lands, ornaments and clothes as gift.
<div n="NI"/>After having done so much, food with milk should be
given for four days and burnt offerings should be made
with gingelly etc. and butea. The gift to the priest
should be double the gifts given to others. (Agni Purāṇa
Chapter 70).
