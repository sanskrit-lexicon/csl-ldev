PARUCCHEPA¦. A sage of Vedic times who was a
Sūktadraṣṭā. He used some sounds too often in his
talks.
<div n="NI"/>Nṛmedhas and Parucchepa vied with each other in
their māntric skill. One day Nṛmedhas in great pride
produced smoke from wet firewood without igniting it
and then Parucchepa produced fire without firewood.
Nṛmedhas admitted defeat. (Taittirīya Saṃhitā).
