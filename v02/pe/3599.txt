KOṬṬUVĀ¦. (Yawning, Gape). In Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 6, there is a story explaining how the living
beings began to yawn. After getting boons from
Brahmā, Vṛttrāsura swallowed Indra. The Devas were
filled with fear and approaching Brhaspati they re-
presented their grievance. According to the instruction
of Bṛhaspati the Devas caused Vṛttrāsura to gape.
After opening the mouth he found it difficult to shut,
and the mouth remained open. In the meanwhile
Indra jumped out of Vṛtra through the mouth. Gape
came into existence from that time. (For details see
under the word Vṛtra.
