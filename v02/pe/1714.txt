DAṆḌA¦ VI (DAṆḌAKA). A thief who had made the
<div n="lb"/>world tremble in the Dvāpara yuga. This wicked Daṇḍ-
<div n="lb"/>aka used to steal the wealth of the Brāhmaṇas, kill
<div n="lb"/>those who trusted him, speak lies, rape the women of
<div n="lb"/>others, drink liquor, eat the flesh of cows, mingle with
<div n="lb"/>wicked people and do various other sinful deeds daily.
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍa once went to a Vaiṣṇavite temple to commit
<div n="lb"/>robbery. When he reached the steps of the temple he
<div n="lb"/>wiped his legs which were wet, on the ground and a
<div n="lb"/>small depression that was there, was levelled by the
[Page200-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>drawing of his legs. He broke the lock with an iron rod
<div n="lb"/>and entered the temple. Inside the temple he saw Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>clad in yellow robes lying on a beautiful cot, with his
<div n="lb"/>spouse Rādhā. The thief instantly bowed before the
<div n="lb"/>spouse of Rādhā. By this act his sins were washed away.
<div n="lb"/>Still impelled by his evil nature, he took the silk garment
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛṣṇa, spread it on the ground, collected as many
<div n="lb"/>things as he could take, placed them in the garment and
<div n="lb"/>making them into a bundle, got out of the temple
<div n="lb"/>with shaky feet. The bundle fell on the ground with a
<div n="lb"/>loud noise. Hearing the noise the neighbours woke up
<div n="lb"/>and looked out. The thief began to run and was bitten
<div n="lb"/>by a poisonous snake and fell down dead. The men of
<div n="lb"/>Yama (God of death) tied the spirit of the thief with a
<div n="lb"/>rope and took him before Yama. Citragupta looked
<div n="lb"/>into his accounts and informed Yama that he had
<div n="lb"/>committed all the sins. Yama asked if there was any
<div n="lb"/>good deed to his account. Then Citragupta said “When
<div n="lb"/>this great sinner was going to commit theft in a Vaiṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vite temple, at the steps of the temple, he levelled a pit
<div n="lb"/>by the mud on his leg, and that single good deed on
<div n="lb"/>his part has wiped out all his sins.” Hearing this Yama
<div n="lb"/>gave him a golden seat and showed hospitality and then
<div n="lb"/>bowed before him and said “By the soil on your legs you
<div n="lb"/>have purified my abode today. I am grateful to you.
<div n="lb"/>Now you may go to the blissful world of Viṣṇu where
<div n="lb"/>there are no deaths or births or sorrow”. Hearing this
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍa entered Vaikuṇṭha. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 1).
