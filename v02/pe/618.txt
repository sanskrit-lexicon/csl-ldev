ATITHI¦ (guest). In ancient Bhārata Atithi-satkāra
(hospitality to a guest) was considered as a yajña. In
Manusmṛti, Chapter 100, Verse 3, it is said that even if
one lives on the scattered grains in the fields after har-
vest, and even if penance is offered in the midst of
Pañcāgni (five fires) unless the Brahmin who comes
as a guest is fed, all virtuous deeds would be useless.
Besides, Manu has made the following remarks about
the Atithi (guest).
<div n="NI"/>“A new visitor at night must be treated as an Atithi.
An Atithi is one who comes occasionally, not daily.
But one who lives in your village and goes about as a
vagabond for a living, does not deserve to be treated as
an Atithi. The guest who comes either before or after
mealtime should not be sent away without being fed.
Even a Vaiśya or Śūdra who comes as a guest to a
Brahmin's house has to be given food when the servants
are given food.”
