ATITHI¦ (guest). In ancient Bhārata Atithi-satkāra
<div n="lb"/>(hospitality to a guest) was considered as a yajña. In
<div n="lb"/>Manusmṛti, Chapter 100, Verse 3, it is said that even if
<div n="lb"/>one lives on the scattered grains in the fields after har-
<div n="lb"/>vest, and even if penance is offered in the midst of
<div n="lb"/>Pañcāgni (five fires) unless the Brahmin who comes
<div n="lb"/>as a guest is fed, all virtuous deeds would be useless.
<div n="lb"/>Besides, Manu has made the following remarks about
<div n="lb"/>the Atithi (guest).
<div n="NI"/>“A new visitor at night must be treated as an Atithi.
<div n="lb"/>An Atithi is one who comes occasionally, not daily.
<div n="lb"/>But one who lives in your village and goes about as a
<div n="lb"/>vagabond for a living, does not deserve to be treated as
<div n="lb"/>an Atithi. The guest who comes either before or after
<div n="lb"/>mealtime should not be sent away without being fed.
<div n="lb"/>Even a Vaiśya or Śūdra who comes as a guest to a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin's house has to be given food when the servants
<div n="lb"/>are given food.”
