DHṚTARĀṢṬRA V¦. One of the famous sons of Vāsuki.
There is a story about this nāga (serpent) in Jaimini,
Āśvamedha Parva, Chapter 39.
<div n="NI"/>After the Bhārata-battle, Yudhiṣṭhira performed horse-
sacrifice. Arjuna led the sacrificial horse. He travelled
far and wide and reached Manalūr. At the instruction
of Ulūpī, Babhruvāhana confronted his father.
A terrible fight ensued and Babhruvāhana cut off the
head of Arjuna. Citrāṅgadā sent Babhruvāhana to the
‘Nāgaloka’ (the world of serpents) to bring the jewel
‘Mṛtasañjīvinī’ to restore her husband to life. The
keeper of this jewel, which was under the custody of
serpent Śeṣa was Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the son of Vāsuki.
<div n="NI"/>Knowing that it was not easy to get the jewel, Babh-
ruvāhana fought with Dhṛtarāṣṭra. After a terrible
fight he got the jewel. But Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who did not
want Arjuna to come to life again, stole the head of
Arjuna, by the help of his sons and threw it into the
hermitage of Dālbhya.
