ŚAKUNI VI¦. The notorious uncle of Duryodhana. Son
<div n="lb"/>of King Subala of Gāndhāra and brother of Gāndhārī.
<div n="lb"/>Śakuni, staying at Hastināpura, pulled the strings for
<div n="lb"/>all the evil actions of Duryodhana. It was Śakuni's
<div n="lb"/>hands, which worked in the background in driving the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas out of the kingdom and in denuding Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>of her clothes. It was also his evil tactics, which tore
<div n="lb"/>asunder all chances of conciliation with the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>on their return from the forest and thus led to the great
<div n="lb"/>war that lasted for eighteen days. At last he was killed
<div n="lb"/>by Sahadeva during the war. (Śalya Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>28, Verse 61). A resume of the part played by Śakuni
