ŚAKUNI VI¦. The notorious uncle of Duryodhana. Son
of King Subala of Gāndhāra and brother of Gāndhārī.
Śakuni, staying at Hastināpura, pulled the strings for
all the evil actions of Duryodhana. It was Śakuni's
hands, which worked in the background in driving the
Pāṇḍavas out of the kingdom and in denuding Pāñcālī
of her clothes. It was also his evil tactics, which tore
asunder all chances of conciliation with the Pāṇḍavas
on their return from the forest and thus led to the great
war that lasted for eighteen days. At last he was killed
by Sahadeva during the war. (Śalya Parva, Chapter
28, Verse 61). A resume of the part played by Śakuni
