<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} This is a holy place situated
36 Kilometres to the north of Ajmer. Brahmā once did
penance there. There is a temple of Brahmā there.
Padma Purāṇa gives a story about the origin of this
tīrtha:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā came to a place holding a lotus. Then
Brahmā saw Vajranābha who was engaged in penance
for the destruction of the devas. Suddenly the lotus in
the hands of Brahmā fell down making a thundering
noise. The sound was so loud that its vibrations killed
Vajranābha. From that day onwards the place was
known as Puṣkara.
