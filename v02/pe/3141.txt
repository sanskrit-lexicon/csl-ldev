KALI I¦. Incarnation of sin, the Sin-god.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapaprajāpati, son of Brahmā, begot of
<div n="lb"/>his wife Muni sixteen sons and Kali was the fifteenth
<div n="lb"/>son. He was a deva-gandharva. The other sons of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa were: Bhīmasena, Ugrasena, Suparṇa, Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gopati, Suvarcas, Satyavāk, Arkaparṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Prayuta, Viśruta, Citraratha, Śāliśiras, Parjanya and
<div n="lb"/>Nārada. (4 Ślokas from verse 43, Chapter 65, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Parīkṣit controlled Kali.%} When Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha, the Pāṇḍavas entrusted the administration
<div n="lb"/>of the state to Parīkṣit, son of Abhimanyu and started
<div n="lb"/>for the Mahāprasthāna. King Parīkṣit was travelling
<div n="lb"/>the continent conquering places when he saw Kali in
<div n="lb"/>the garb of a Śūdra King teasing a cow and bull
<div n="lb"/>couple. Parīkṣit aimed an arrow at him and then Kali
<div n="lb"/>came and bowed down before the King. The King did
<div n="lb"/>not kill him. He let him go free but ordered him to go
<div n="lb"/>away from his state. Kali was nonplussed because all
<div n="lb"/>the land belonged to Parīkṣit and there was no place
<div n="lb"/>for him to go. So Kali begged of the King to give him
<div n="lb"/>some space to live. Parīkṣit then declared that Kali
<div n="lb"/>could live in the following five places: Gambling’
<div n="lb"/>Drinking, Woman, Murder and Gold. From that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards the free movements of Kali were thus restricted
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 17, 1st Skandha, Bhāgavata).
[Page374-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kali, Lord of Kaliyuga.%} There are fourteen Man-
<div n="lb"/>vantaras during the life of Brahmā. The life time of a
<div n="lb"/>Manu is a Manvantara. This present period is the
<div n="lb"/>seventh Manvantara. In each Manvantara there are
<div n="lb"/>four yugas, Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali. Kṛtayuga
<div n="lb"/>consists of 17,28000 years, Tretāyuga consists of 12,-
<div n="lb"/>96000 years, Dvāparayuga 8,64000 years and Kaliyuga
<div n="lb"/>4,32,000 years. The christian era started in the Kali
<div n="lb"/>era 3102 and after another 4,26926 years Kaliyuga will
<div n="lb"/>come to an end and the present universe will enter
<div n="lb"/>the eighth Manvantara. From the beginning of the
<div n="lb"/>Kaliyuga acts of sin predominate and Kali, sin-god,
<div n="lb"/>will lord over the world.
<div n="NI"/>Kali was born on the day Śrī Kṛṣṇa ascended heaven.
<div n="lb"/>When Bhagavān Mukunda abandoned his body and
<div n="lb"/>went to his place in Vaikuṇṭha. Kali came into being
<div n="lb"/>binding all on earth. (Śloka 66, Chapter 1, Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kali and Nala.%} Kali and Dvāpara were going to
<div n="lb"/>the Svayaṃvara of Damayantī when they met Indra
<div n="lb"/>and others returning from the Svayaṃvara. They told
<div n="lb"/>Kali and Dvāpara that Damayantī was married to Nala.
<div n="lb"/>Kali and Dvāpara felt it an outrage that Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>should have married a man of the earth and not a deva.
<div n="lb"/>Kali decided that Nala should be sent out of his
<div n="lb"/>country and his matrimonial life made most unhappy.
<div n="lb"/>Dvāpara consented to be his accomplice in this attempt.
<div n="lb"/>Kali followed Nala waiting for an opportunity to enter
<div n="lb"/>his body. One day, by an oversight Nala, without doing
<div n="lb"/>the ācamana after passing urine, performed his sandhyā-
<div n="lb"/>vandana. Taking that opportunity Kali entered the
<div n="lb"/>body of Nala. Kali went to Puṣkara, brother of Nala in
<div n="lb"/>the guise of a bullock and made Nala challenge his bro-
<div n="lb"/>ther to a game of dice putting that bullock as a wager.
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkara accepted the challenge. Nala wagered and lost
<div n="lb"/>all his movable and immovable possessions and went to
<div n="lb"/>the forests with Damayantī. Nala, prompted by Kali,
<div n="lb"/>abandoned Damayantī in the forests and went his way.
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī cursed Kali.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that the great serpent Karkoṭaka was
<div n="lb"/>entrapped in a wild fire. Nala saved him from the fire
<div n="lb"/>but in return the cobra bit him turning Nala into one
<div n="lb"/>of blue hue and said “Oh Nala, let Kali who cheat-
<div n="lb"/>ed you and is now inside your body suffer with the
<div n="lb"/>poison I have injected into your body.”
<div n="NI"/>Nala roamed about and reached Ayodhyā and there
<div n="lb"/>became the charioteer of Ṛtuparṇa, King of Ayodhyā.
<div n="lb"/>When Ṛtuparṇa went to the second marriage of
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī to Vidarbha, Nala went with him as his
<div n="lb"/>charioteer. On the way Nala taught Ṛtuparṇa the
<div n="lb"/>science of Aśvahṛdaya and Ṛtuparṇa in return
<div n="lb"/>taught him the science of Akṣahṛdaya. When Nala
<div n="lb"/>learnt the secret of Akṣahṛdaya he vomited all the poison
<div n="lb"/>inside him and Kali left him. Nala was about to curse
<div n="lb"/>Kali but refrained from it at the request of Kali. At
<div n="lb"/>once Kali climbed on a Tānni tree (Beleric Myro-
<div n="lb"/>balan) and went down from the tree when Nala left
<div n="lb"/>the place. Tānni is from that day onwards considered
<div n="lb"/>a cursed tree. (Chapter 58, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The world in Kaliyuga.%} The celebrated sage Mār-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇḍeya had prophesied about the happenings in Kali-
<div n="lb"/>yuga thus: In Kaliyuga all will be dishonest. Charity
<div n="lb"/>and Sacrifices will be only for a name. Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>would do the duties of Śūdras. Śūdras will become
<div n="lb"/>prosperous. There will be sinners as kings. People will
[Page374-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>be short-lived and the stature of the people also will
<div n="lb"/>diminish. Beastly type of men will be on the increase.
<div n="lb"/>Taste and smell will vanish. Women will be ‘Mukhe-
<div n="lb"/>bhagās’. Men will sell rice and brāhmaṇas, the Vedas.
<div n="lb"/>Women will sell their vaginas. The yield of milk from
<div n="lb"/>cows will decrease. Flowers and fruits will become less.
<div n="lb"/>Crows will be on the increase. Brāhmaṇas would become
<div n="lb"/>beggars. Sages will be merchants. Brāhmaṇas would
<div n="lb"/>without any reason grow hairs and nails. None will
<div n="lb"/>observe the four āśramas correctly. Students will defile
<div n="lb"/>the bed of their preceptors. Rains will be in and out of
<div n="lb"/>season. Trees and plants will refuse to grow in many
<div n="lb"/>places. There will be murder of people everywhere.
<div n="lb"/>Merchants will be cheats and they will use false mea-
<div n="lb"/>sures. Righteous persons will decrease and sinners will
<div n="lb"/>increase. Girls of seven or eight years will become
<div n="lb"/>pregnant and boys will become fathers. Young men at
<div n="lb"/>the age of sixteen would be grey-haired. Old men will
<div n="lb"/>continue practising the habits of young men. Wives
<div n="lb"/>will lie with their servants. Wives will be prostitutes
<div n="lb"/>even while their husbands are alive. People will die in
<div n="lb"/>lots of hunger.” (Chapter 188. Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kaliyugatīrtha.%} The greatest tīrtha of Kaliyuga is
<div n="lb"/>the river Gaṅgā. (Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Duryodhana was the incarnation of Kali and Śakuni, that%}
<div n="lb"/>of Dvāpara. (Chāpter 31, Āśrama Parva).
