VARUṆA I¦. One of the eight guardians of the quarters.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Varuṇa was the son of Prajāpati, Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>born of Aditi. He was one of the twelve sons of Aditi.
<div n="lb"/>So he is considered to be one of the twelve Ādityas (Sons
<div n="lb"/>of Aditi). The twelve Ādityas are Dhātā, Aryaman,
<div n="lb"/>Mitra, Śakra, Varuṇa, Aṃśa, Bhaga, Vivaśvān, Pūṣā,
<div n="lb"/>Savitā, Tvaṣṭā and Viṣṇu. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>65, Stanza 15).
<div n="NI"/>These twelve Ādityas were the twelve Devas (gods)
<div n="lb"/>known as Tuṣitas in the Manvantara of Manu Cākṣuṣa.
<div n="lb"/>A statement occurs in Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>15, that when Vaivasvata Manvantara was about to
<div n="lb"/>begin after the end of Cākṣuṣa Manvantara, the famous
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣitas united together and took birth as the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kingship of the waters.%} In Kṛtayuga the Devas
<div n="lb"/>approached Varuṇa and said to him. “You must be
<div n="lb"/>the lord of all the waters, as Indra is our protector. You
<div n="lb"/>can live in the heart of the ocean. All the rivers in the
<div n="lb"/>world, and the ocean which is their husband will obey
<div n="lb"/>you. You will wax and wane along with Candra
<div n="lb"/>(Moon).” Varuṇa agreed to comply with their request.
[Page832-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>All of them anointed Varuṇa as the King of the
<div n="lb"/>waters. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 47).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Guardian of the quarter west.%} Brahmā appointed
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa as the guardian of the western zone. Vaiśravaṇa
<div n="lb"/>once did penance before Brahmā, and when Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him, he made a request that he should
<div n="lb"/>be appointed as one of the guardians of the quarters.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā replied. “I have already selected Indra, Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Yama as guardians of the points. I was thinking
<div n="lb"/>who, the fourth, should be, when you came. So from
<div n="lb"/>this day onwards, Indra shall be the guardian of the
<div n="lb"/>East, Yama that of the South, Varuṇa, that of the
<div n="lb"/>West and you Vaiśravaṇa shall be the guardian of the
<div n="lb"/>North.” After saying this, Brahmā disappeared. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa became the guardian of the West. (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family.%} Varuṇa had several wives and children.
<div n="lb"/>Prominent among them were Gaurī and Varuṇānī.
<div n="lb"/>Mention is made about the sons Suṣeṇa, Vandī and
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and daughter Vāruṇī. Cārṣaṇī was another
<div n="lb"/>wife of Varuṇa. Prajāpati Bhṛgu, who died in the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice of Dakṣa took birth as the son of Varuṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Cārṣaṇī. Devī Jyeṣṭhā, the daughter of Priest Śukra was
<div n="lb"/>another wife of Varuṇa. The children of Jyeṣṭhā were
<div n="lb"/>Bala, Surā the Suranandinī and Adharmaka the destroy-
<div n="lb"/>er of the elements. The semen of Varuṇa fell on
<div n="lb"/>Valmīka (White-ant-hill) from which the great hermit
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki was born. Besides them, Dakṣasāvarṇi, the
<div n="lb"/>ninth Manu was the son of Varuṇa. Puṣkara was an-
<div n="lb"/>other son of Varuṇa. The handsome Puṣkara was
<div n="lb"/>received as husband by the daughter of Soma (Can-
<div n="lb"/>dra). Vandī, who was defeated by the hermit Aṣṭā-
<div n="lb"/>vakra at the palace of Janaka was the son of Varuṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 117, Stanza 9; Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 52; Ādi Parva, Chapter 99,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 5; Vana Parva, Chapter 134, Stanza 24; Vāl-

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Carrying away Utathya's wife.%} Bhadrā, the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Soma (Moon) was extremely beautiful. Some gave
<div n="lb"/>her in marriage to the hermit Utathya. Varuṇa carried
<div n="lb"/>her away. Utathya got angry and drank up the ocean
<div n="lb"/>dry. Varuṇa returned Bhadrā to Utathya. (For
<div n="lb"/>further details see under Utathya).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Theft of Varuṇa's cow by Kaśyapa.%} Kaśyapa once
<div n="lb"/>decided to perform a sacrifice. He made all prepara-
<div n="lb"/>tions. But he did not get the required cow at the sti-
<div n="lb"/>pulated time. So he got the Homadhenu of Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>by theft and began to perform the yāga (sacrifice).
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa knew this. Instantly he went to Kaśyapa and
<div n="lb"/>demanded his cow. But Kaśyapa refused to return the
<div n="lb"/>cow. Varuṇa complained to Brahmā, who sent for
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa and asked him about the cow and both
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and Varuṇa cursed Kaśyapa that he who had
<div n="lb"/>taken the cow by stealth would take birth as a cowherd
<div n="lb"/>in Ambāḍi. (For further details see under Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>and Nandagopa).
