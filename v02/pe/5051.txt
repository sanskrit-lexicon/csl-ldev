PARĪKṢIT II¦. There is a story about another Parīkṣit
<div n="lb"/>belonging to the Ikṣvāku dynasty of kings in chapter 192
<div n="lb"/>of Vana Parva:
<div n="NI"/>Once this Parīkṣit went after a deer while hunting in a
<div n="lb"/>forest and he traversed a long distance following it. On
<div n="lb"/>the way he felt tired by hunger and thirst. He saw a
<div n="lb"/>green grove and a river running still by its side, then.
<div n="lb"/>The king entered the waters of the river with his horse
<div n="lb"/>and after quenching the thirst of the horse and drinking
<div n="lb"/>some water to quench his own thirst, he bound the
<div n="lb"/>horse to a nearby tree and lay on the shores to take rest.
<div n="lb"/>Then he heard from somewhere a melodious song.
<div n="lb"/>The king raised his head and enjoying the music,
<div n="lb"/>waited to see the origin of it. Then a beautiful damsel
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and the king talked with her and
<div n="lb"/>their conversation ended in the king requesting her to
<div n="lb"/>be his wife. The beautiful maiden consented on one
<div n="lb"/>condition that she should not be made to touch water.
<div n="lb"/>The king agreed and by that time the king's followers
<div n="lb"/>came and the king took her to his palace in a decorated
<div n="lb"/>palanquin followed by his retinue. The king took her
<div n="lb"/>to a secret chamber and stayed with her allowing no-
<div n="lb"/>body to enter the room. The chief minister came to
<div n="lb"/>the palace and enquired what was happening there and
<div n="lb"/>the maidens attending on the queen said that it was
<div n="lb"/>strange that no water was allowed inside the room.
<div n="lb"/>Then the minister arranged a garden with beautiful
<div n="lb"/>flowers and fruits with no water anywhere and a pond
<div n="lb"/>in the middle in which water was not visible from
<div n="lb"/>outside. He then went to the king and told him of his
<div n="lb"/>arrangement and the king took his wife into the garden
<div n="lb"/>and started having amorous sport with her there.
<div n="lb"/>After some time they reached the pond; water was not
<div n="lb"/>visible and so they entered the pond. The moment
<div n="lb"/>they entered the pond they touched water and the
<div n="lb"/>queen disappeared in the water. The King asked the
<div n="lb"/>water of the pond to be emptied and then he saw a
<div n="lb"/>frog sitting at the bottom. The king accused the frog
<div n="lb"/>of having eaten the maiden and he started killing all
<div n="lb"/>the frogs of his state. The frogs became frightened and
<div n="lb"/>they went to their king and complained. The frog-
<div n="lb"/>king in the garb of a maharṣi went and requested the
<div n="lb"/>king to stop this massacre of frogs but the king refused
<div n="lb"/>to yield saying that a frog had eaten his wife. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>that, the sage was shocked and revealing his identity
<div n="lb"/>said “Oh King, be pleased with me; I am Āyus, the
<div n="lb"/>king of the frogs. Your wife was my daughter. She is
<div n="lb"/>called Suśobhanā and she is an obstinate bad-natured
<div n="lb"/>girl. Even from times of old she has cheated many kings
<div n="lb"/>like this.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this the king pleaded to the frog-king to give
<div n="lb"/>him back Suśobhanā. He gave Suśobhanā to Parīkṣit.
[Page574-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>But he cursed his daughter that she would bear
<div n="lb"/>misbehaving children because of her cheating many
<div n="lb"/>kings before. Āyus disappeared then. Parīkṣit begot
<div n="lb"/>of Suśobhanā three princes named Śala, Bala and Dala.
<div n="lb"/>When Śala grew up Parīkṣit crowned him as king and
<div n="lb"/>left for the forests for doing penance. (Chapter 192, Vana-
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
