ANASŪYĀ¦. Wife of Sage Atri, son of Brahmā. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Mahāviṣṇu were born in order
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Svāyambhuva Manu, Devahūti, Anasūyā. To
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva, son of Brahmā, was born by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Śatarūpā five children: Uttānapāda, Priyavrata, Āhuti.
<div n="lb"/>Devahūti and Prasūti and Devahūti was married to
<div n="lb"/>Kardama, son of Brahmā. They begot two daughters,
<div n="lb"/>Kalā and Anasūyā. Marīci married Kalā and Atri
<div n="lb"/>married Anasūyā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 1, Chapter 4).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The Tapaśśakti of Anasūyā.%} Once upon a time, rains
<div n="lb"/>having failed for ten years the whole world sweated in
<div n="lb"/>agony and river Gaṅgā got dried up. Famine stalked the
<div n="lb"/>world. In this dire contingency it was the tapaśśakti of
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā that made trees bear fruits and Gaṅgā to flow
<div n="lb"/>again. Also, she converted ten days into nights on the
<div n="lb"/>request of the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>During their forest life Rāma and Sītā reached the her-
<div n="lb"/>mitage of sage Atri, and the sage and Anasūyā treated
<div n="lb"/>the guests sumptuously. The above story about the
<div n="lb"/>tapaśśakti of Anasūyā was told then by Atri. The story
<div n="lb"/>helped to increase Rāma's respect for Anasūyā. Anasūyā
<div n="lb"/>gave Sītā all proper advice. She taught Sītā that abso-
<div n="lb"/>lute service to husband is the greatest tapas ordained
<div n="lb"/>to women. Anasūyā gave to Sītā a very sacred garland
<div n="lb"/>and a sublime gem. And, after that Rāma and Sītā left
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyākāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Cantos 117 and 118.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sons of Anasūyā.%} She had three sons: Dattātreya,
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas and Candra. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>10). (The reason for Mahāviṣṇu being born as Dattāt-
<div n="lb"/>reya, Śiva as Durvāsas and Brahmā as Candra to
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā is given under Atri).
