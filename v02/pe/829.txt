BABHRUDAIVĀVṚDHA¦. A Yādava king. The informa-
tion from Purāṇas available about him is given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) This Rājarṣi was an adept in the art of yajña. He
was a disciple of Nārada and Parvata Maharṣi. (Aita-
reya Brāhmaṇa 7. 34).
<div n="NI"/>2) He was a Yādava of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty and one of the
seven noted ministers of the Yadu line of Kings. (Sabhā
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) At the time of the kidnapping of Subhadrā Babhru-
daivāvṛdha was partaking in a grand festival at the
mountain of Raivataka. (Chapter 211, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) When once this Rājarṣi went on a visit to Kṛṣṇa,
Śiśupāla carried away his wife. (Chapter 42, Sabhā
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) When in the end the Yādavas in Dvārakā quarrelled
with each other and were destroyed, the plight of the
Yādava ladies became miserable. Then Śrī Kṛṣṇa
entrusted Dvāraka and Babhrudaivāvṛdha with the task
of taking care of them. But in the battle of the maces
he was killed with a mace thrown at him. (Chapter 5,
Mausala Parva, M.B.).
