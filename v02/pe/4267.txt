MAMMAṬA¦. An Indian scholar who lived about
1100 A.D. He was a great scholar and critic in Sanskrit
and was born in Kashmir. His masterpiece was a
great book “Kāvya Prakāśa”. It is divided into ten
chapters. Each chapter is entitled “Ullāsa”. There is a
view expressed by some people that Mammaṭa wrote
only the first nine chapters of this book and the last
chapter was written by another scholar named Alaka.

have been published. It is said that Patañjali's commenta-
tor Kayyaṭa was the brother of Mammaṭa. “Śabda
Vyāpāra Vicāra” is another book written by Mammaṭa.
