ANDHATĀMISRA¦. One of the 28 hells. (See Naraka).
<div n="lb"/>This hell is destined for wives who cheat their husbands
<div n="lb"/>and consume food and for husbands who cheat their
<div n="lb"/>wives and eat food. Agents of Yama get hold of
<div n="lb"/>such sinners and push them into the Andhatāmisra. As
<div n="lb"/>the cords of the agents with which they bind the sin-
<div n="lb"/>ners get tighter around their bodies they faint and fall
<div n="lb"/>down owing to unbearable pain. When they regain
<div n="lb"/>consciousness and try to run away and escape, the
<div n="lb"/>Agents of Yama again bind them with the cord. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha).
