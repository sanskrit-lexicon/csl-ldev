KAṂSA I¦. Son of Ugrasena, King of Mathurā, and an
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of an Asura called Kālanemi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu: Brahmā-

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kaṃsa, an incarnation of Kālanemi.%} In the svāyam-
<div n="lb"/>bhuvamanvantara Marīci had a wife named Ūrṇā and
<div n="lb"/>they had six mighty and powerful sons. One day they
<div n="lb"/>ridiculed Brahmā saying ‘A father who has married his
<div n="lb"/>won daughter’ (Brahmā married Sarasvatī, his own
<div n="lb"/>daughter). Brahmā became angry and cursed them to
<div n="lb"/>be born as demons on earth. All the six sons were,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, born as sons of a demon called Kālanemi on
<div n="lb"/>earth. In their next birth they were born as sons of
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu. They led a pious life and pleased at
<div n="lb"/>this Brahmā asked them what boon they wanted and
<div n="lb"/>they demanded that they should not be killed by any-
<div n="lb"/>body. Their father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, did not like his
<div n="lb"/>sons getting a boon behind his back and so he cursed
<div n="lb"/>his sons “May you all six go to Pātāla (nether-world)
<div n="lb"/>and sleep there for a long time under the name of
<div n="lb"/>Ṣaḍarbhakas. The sons begged for relief and Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu said that they would after sleeping for a long
<div n="lb"/>time be born to Devakī, wife of Vasudeva, as their
<div n="lb"/>children and that Kālanemi, their father in their pre-
<div n="lb"/>vious birth would then be born as Kaṃsa and kill the
<div n="lb"/>children of Devakī by striking their heads on the
<div n="lb"/>ground.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Kālanemi was born as Kaṃsa and he
<div n="lb"/>killed the six children of Devakī by striking them on
<div n="lb"/>the ground. (Skandha 4, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>The 10th Skandha of Bhāgavata states “killing Kāla-
<div n="lb"/>nemi born as Kaṃsa” when it refers to the killing of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Another story regarding the birth of Kaṃsa.%} Kaṃsa
<div n="lb"/>was not actually the son of Ugrasena. It was Nārada
<div n="lb"/>who revealed to Kaṃsa the story of his birth. It is as
<div n="lb"/>follows.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the wife of Ugrasena was in her menses she
<div n="lb"/>went to the garden with her companions. Then a
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva named Dramila disguised as Ugrasena
<div n="lb"/>went to her but she knew the trick and cursed him
<div n="lb"/>that he would go to hell. But Dramila committed rape
<div n="lb"/>on her and then left the place making her pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>When the child was born Ugrasena's wife greatly hated
<div n="lb"/>the child got of an evil deed and cursed it saying that
<div n="lb"/>the child would be killed by a member of the family
<div n="lb"/>of Ugrasena. Thus Kaṃsa was the son born to the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Ugrasena by the Gandharva, Dramila. It was because
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa was aware of it that he behaved very badly to
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena and Kṛṣṇa. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Kaṃsa got Mathurāpurī.%} In olden times there
<div n="lb"/>was a famous place called Madhuvana in the
<div n="lb"/>river-base of Kālindī. The place got the name of Madhu-
<div n="lb"/>vana because the demon Madhu was residing there.
[Page382-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Madhu had a son named Lavaṇa. Lavaṇa was a very
<div n="lb"/>wicked demon always ill-treating the devas. Śatrughna,
<div n="lb"/>son of Daśaratha, killed him and lived there establishing
<div n="lb"/>a beautiful kingdom there. He named that place
<div n="lb"/>Mathurā. After the death of Śatrughna two of his sons
<div n="lb"/>ruled that country. Then when the Sūrya dynasty be-
<div n="lb"/>came extinct the city of Mathurā came into the possess-
<div n="lb"/>ion of the Yadu dynasty. It was ruled then by a very
<div n="lb"/>brave and valiant ruler named Śūrasena. Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of Śūrasena. After the
<div n="lb"/>death of Śūrasena another King of the Yādava dynasty,
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena, became the ruler of the place, Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>accepting cow-rearing as his profession. Kaṃsa became
<div n="lb"/>King keeping Ugrasena as a prisoner. (Skandha 4,
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Vasudeva and Devakī are imprisoned.%} Vasudeva married
<div n="lb"/>Devakī daughter of Ugrasena and sister, of Kaṃsa.
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa pleased with his sister presented her with a
<div n="lb"/>chariot. Kaṃsa, Vasudeva and Devakī ascended the
<div n="lb"/>chariot and Kaṃsa himself drove the chariot. Then
<div n="lb"/>from an unknown source above came a voice which
<div n="lb"/>said “Oh King, know thou this and from this moment
<div n="lb"/>chalk out thy plans for the future. The eighth son of
<div n="lb"/>your sister will kill you for certain. You will be no
<div n="lb"/>match against him.” (Chapter 1, Bhāgavata 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this voice from heaven Kaṃsa got furious and
<div n="lb"/>dragging his sister by the hair raised his sword to kill
<div n="lb"/>her. Vasudeva then pleaded weeping not to kill Devakī.
<div n="lb"/>Only the eighth child of Devakī was going to kill him.
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva would hand over all the children to him as
<div n="lb"/>soon as they were born. Such arguments pacified Kaṃsa
<div n="lb"/>and he left off Devakī without hurting her.
<div n="NI"/>Devakī delivered a son. He grew up under the name
<div n="lb"/>of Kīrtimān and one day Nārada visited Kaṃsa and
<div n="lb"/>told him that he was the incarnation of an Asura named
<div n="lb"/>Kālanemi and the son who would be born to Devakī
<div n="lb"/>to kill him was Nārāyaṇa. Kaṃsa, blind with fury,
<div n="lb"/>killed Kīrtimān by striking him on the earth and im-
<div n="lb"/>prisoned both Devakī and Vasudeva.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Man-hunt of Kaṃsa.%} Pralamba, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta,
<div n="lb"/>Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭaka, Keśī, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and
<div n="lb"/>Pūtanā were born in the Asura family as servants of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa. He sent them to different sides of the country
<div n="lb"/>to torment the Yādavas. Many Yādavas left the place.
<div n="lb"/>Even Kaṃsa's father Ugrasena, a great devotee of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was teased.
<div n="NI"/>In the meantime Devakī delivered six sons including
<div n="lb"/>Kīrtimān and all of them were killed by Kaṃsa by
<div n="lb"/>smashing their heads against the ground below. The
<div n="lb"/>seventh foetus of Devakī was aborted. (Instructed by
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu, Māyādevī invoked the seventh foetus of
<div n="lb"/>Devakī and transferred it to the womb of Rohiṇī
<div n="lb"/>another wife of Vasudeva. The child thus born to Rohinī
<div n="lb"/>was Saṅkarṣaṇa or Balabhadrarāmā. Mahāviṣṇu then
<div n="lb"/>entered the womb of Devakī instructing Māyādevī to
<div n="lb"/>enter that of Yaśodā, wife of Nandagopa of Ambāḍi at
<div n="lb"/>the same time. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was then born in the figure
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu. The watchmen were sleeping. Following
<div n="lb"/>directions from the new-born child Vasudeva took the
<div n="lb"/>child to Gokula and leaving the child there brought
<div n="lb"/>back the child of Yaśodā and placed it near Devakī.
<div n="lb"/>When the watchmen awoke and knew about the deli-
<div n="lb"/>very of Devakī they immediately ran to Kaṃsa to tell
[Page383-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>him. Boiling with rage Kaṃsa rushed to the side of
<div n="lb"/>Devakī and taking the child by the legs raised it for
<div n="lb"/>smashing it against the ground. The child to the fright-
<div n="lb"/>ened dis may of Kaṃsa slipped from his hand and
<div n="lb"/>rising up in the air said “Hi, ill-mannered wicked
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa, do not waste your valour on women. Your
<div n="lb"/>killer has already been born on earth. Do search for
<div n="lb"/>him quickly.”
<div n="NI"/>Kaṃsa went pale with fright on hearing this and went
<div n="lb"/>away to his palace.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Conspiracy of Kaṃsa.%} The thought that his killer
<div n="lb"/>was born somewhere made him restless. He let off
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva and Devakī finding them innocent. Then he
<div n="lb"/>sat sadly pondering over the future. The courtiers then
<div n="lb"/>advised him to kill all the children who had been born
<div n="lb"/>within the past ten days and that would include the
<div n="lb"/>killer also. Kaṃsa accordingly sent to different parts
<div n="lb"/>of the country his secret agents to kill all children, ten
<div n="lb"/>days old.
<div n="NI"/>During this campaign Pūtanā, Śakaṭa, Tṛṇāvarta,
<div n="lb"/>Ariṣṭaka and Keśī tried to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa also but
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa killed them all easily. For details see under each
<div n="lb"/>head separately. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kaṃsa is slain.%} Ariṣṭaka was one of the prominent
<div n="lb"/>Asuras sent to kill Kṛṣṇa. He attacked Kṛṣṇa in the
<div n="lb"/>form of an ox. Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed it without any diffi-
<div n="lb"/>culty. Nārada who saw this incident informed Kaṃsa
<div n="lb"/>about it adding that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Vasudeva only and the child who slipped out
<div n="lb"/>of his hands was the child of Yasodā. Kaṃsa got furious
<div n="lb"/>and he again imprisoned Vasudeva and Devakī and
<div n="lb"/>brought to Mathurā Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma
<div n="lb"/>and started thinking of ways and means to kill them.
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa arranged to conduct a grand celebration of
<div n="lb"/>Āyudhapūjā (worship of the weapons) and invited
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma for the same among many other
<div n="lb"/>gopas from Ambāḍi. He sent his chariot with Akrūra
<div n="lb"/>to fetch Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma from Ambāḍi. Akrūra
<div n="lb"/>privately informed Kṛṣṇa of the bad intentions of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa. Nandagopa and many others from Ambāḍi
<div n="lb"/>started for Mathurā. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra-
<div n="lb"/>rāma started their journey in the chariot the gopas and
<div n="lb"/>gopikās assembled there cried loudly. Some blamed
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra.
<div n="NI"/>Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma reached Mathurā. There they slew
<div n="lb"/>a huge wild elephant and the five Asuras, Cāṇūra,
<div n="lb"/>Muṣṭika, Kūṭa, Śala and Kosala whom Kaṃsa had kept
<div n="lb"/>ready to kill Kṛṣṇa and Rāma. Sitting on a platform
<div n="lb"/>watching this, Kaṃsa became frightened and restless
<div n="lb"/>and roared with rage thus “The sons of Nandagopa
<div n="lb"/>should be instantly sent away from this palace. All
<div n="lb"/>their wealth and all that of the gopas should be con-
<div n="lb"/>fiscated. Bind with ropes the rogue Nandagopa, and
<div n="lb"/>kill the wicked Vasudeva. Throw my father, Ugrasena,
<div n="lb"/>into the river Kālindī bound hand and foot. Even a
<div n="lb"/>father should be killed if he was a relative of one's
<div n="lb"/>enemy.”
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma boiled with rage when they
<div n="lb"/>heard the orders of Kaṃsa and Kṛṣṇa, jumping on to
<div n="lb"/>the platform pushed Kaṃsa down and jumping down
<div n="lb"/>along with him killed him. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kaṃsa had married the two daughters of Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha named Asti and Prāpti. (10th Skandha, Bhā-
<div n="lb"/>gavata).
[Page383-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kaṃsa was a fierce bow-man. All the kings hated
<div n="lb"/>him. Kaṃsa kept under him a crore of fighting men.
<div n="lb"/>He had eight lakhs of charioteers and an equal number
<div n="lb"/>of elephants. His army contained thirtytwo lakhs of
<div n="lb"/>horses. (Dākṣinātyapāṭha; M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 38).
