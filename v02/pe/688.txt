ĀDITYA¦. The twelve sons born to the sage Kaśyapa of
his wife Aditi are known as the twelve Ādityas. They
are the following: Dhātā, Mitra, Aryamā, Rudra,
Varuṇa, Sūrya, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā, Savitā, Tvaṣṭā
and Viṣṇu. Besides these Aditi had twentyone children
including Indra. All of them are called Ādityas mean-
ing children of Aditi. From the thirtythree sons of Aditi
were born the thirtythree crores of devatās. Of these
the eldest is Indra and the youngest, Vāmana. (Śloka
36, Chapter 66, Ādi Parva, M.B.). (There is corrobora-
tion for this in Śloka 14, Sarga 14, Araṇya Kāṇḍa,
Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Sirdar K.M. Panikar in his preface to the book “Ṛgveda-
saṃhitā” writes thus about Ādityas: “Generally we
think of Sūrya (the Sun) when we hear the word
Āditya. But there are many different Ādityas in Ṛg-
veda, chief of them is Varuṇa. Though Savitā, Pūṣā
[Page086-b+ 64]
and Mitra are all synonyms of Sūrya in Ṛgveda they
are all separate devas. There is no end to the varieties
of Ādityas and their prominence in the Vedas. Sum-
marising we can say thus. The familiar devas like
Indra, Agni, Varuṇa and Sūrya are not found in the
same form or power as we are taught to believe. Those
whom we have lowered down to the posts of the eight
sentries of the universe are very prominent devatās in
the Vedas. Many Ādityas have merged in Sūrya and
winds in the god of Vāyu. Rudra has merged in Śiva.
Who will believe that the all-powerful Deva of the Ṛg-
veda and the vainglorious Indra who lives in fear of
men doing penance are one and the same person?”
