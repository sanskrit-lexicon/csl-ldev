ALPAKĀLA¦(M). A short time. (Alpa=short and Kāla
=time). In the Bhāgavata the following definition is
given of alpakāla: “Take two tender leaves of a lotus
and place one on the other. Let a strong man take a
sharp needle and thrust it hard at the leaves. The time
taken for the needle to pierce one leaf and reach the
other is alpakāla”. [Bhāgavata (Malayalam version),
Skandha 3].
