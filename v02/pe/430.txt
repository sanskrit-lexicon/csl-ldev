ARIṢṬA¦ (ARIṢṬAKA). An asura, a servant of Kaṃsa.
<div n="lb"/>Once, at the instance of Kaṃsa he went to Gokula
<div n="lb"/>disguised as an ox to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The ox instilled
<div n="lb"/>terror in people by tearing to pieces hills and mountains
[Page048-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>with its horns and bellowing like hell. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>faced the beast, and rained blows on him and it was
<div n="lb"/>thrown hundred yojanas away and it died. At the time
<div n="lb"/>of death it regained its fromer from as Asura. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Daśama, Skandha, Chapter 37).
