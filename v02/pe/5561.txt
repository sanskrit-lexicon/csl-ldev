PUṢPAKA I¦. A divine Aerial Chariot.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Viśvakarmā had a daughter named Saṃjñā.
She was married to Sūrya. But Saṃjñā could not live
with Sūrya for long because of the terrible heat and so
she came back and told her father about it. At once
Viśvakarmā ordered Sūrya to come to him and the
former then tried to reduce his brightness by rubbing
him on a grindstone. However much he tried he was
not able to reduce even an eighth of his brightness.
The brightness of the Sun which was rubbed out spread
in the atmosphere as suspended lustrous particles.
Viśvakarmā collected that lustrous dust and from it
created four brilliant things. The Cakrāyudha of
Mahāviṣṇu is one, the Triśūla of Śiva is another, and
the third is Puṣpakavimāna (Puṣpaka Aerial chariot).
The fourth is Śakti, a weapon of Subrahmaṇya. Viśva-
karmā gave them all as presents to Brahmā. (Chapter
2, Aṃ a 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Kubera got the Puṣpaka.%} Vaiśravaṇa alias
Kubera was the son born to Viśravas of his wife
Devavarṇinī, daughter of sage Bharadvāja. Viśravas
did penance to please Brahmā to get a son and Vaiś-
ravaṇa was born by the blessing of Brahmā. Kubera
also, even while he was a boy, went to the valley of
Himavān and did penance there. Kubera did penance
for ten thousand years with his head downwards in
cold water and another ten thousand years in Pañcāgni
standing on one leg. At that time Brahmā appeared
in person and asked what boon he wanted. He said he
wanted to be one of the lokapālakas (guardians of the
universe). Granting Kubera that, Brahmā gave him
two treasures named Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi
and also the Puṣpakavimāna. After that Kubera built
a city named Laṅkā on the mountain of Trikūṭa in the
southern ocean and started living there.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Rāvaṇa got the Puṣpaka.%} Viśravas had three
more sons named Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhī-
saṇa. They did penance and acquired divine powers.
Rāvaṇa then went to Laṅkā and after defeating Kubera
and sending him north captured Laṅkā and made it
his capital. He also took by force the Puṣpaka from
Kubera.
<div n="NI"/>All the victory marches of Rāvaṇa were in this Puṣpaka.
Once Rāvaṇa was going in his Puṣpaka with a Yakṣa
[Page624-a+ 65]
beauty kidnapped from Alakāpurī when the girl cried
loudly attracting the attention of Sampāti, a vulture
King. Sampāti attacked Rāvaṇa with his fierce beak
and powerful claws. Rāvaṇa's weapons proved futile
against Sampāti and the bird broke the Puṣpaka into
pieces. But the Vimāna was a divine one and it
regained the original shape and utility soon. All the
weapons of Rāvaṇa were destroyed, the great weapon
Candrahāsa was thrown away. The crown of Rāvaṇa
was struck down and trampled upon. With his sharp
beak and piercing claws Sampāti made bruises on the
face of Rāvaṇa. Unable to bear the attack of the
mighty bird Rāvaṇa begged for peace. Sampāti asked
Rāvaṇa to release the Yakṣa girl which Rāvaṇa did at
once. Rāvaṇa then returned to Laṅkā in the Puṣpaka
(Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa). It was in
this Puṣpaka plane that Rāvaṇa kidnapped Sītā. In
the battle that followed, Rāvaṇa was killed and the
Puṣpaka Vimāna came into the possession of Vibhīṣaṇa
who gave it as a gift to Śrī Rāma. Śrī Rāma sent it
back to its original owner, Kubera. But Śrī Rāma used
it again for once.
<div n="NI"/>A śūdra named Śambūka started performing penance
in Rāmarājya as a consequence of which there started a
series of infant deaths in the country. Śrī Rāma knew
the cause and he got down by meditation the Puṣpaka
Vimāna from Kubera. When the plane came from
Kubera Śrī Rāma got into it and flew to the place
where Śambūka was doing penance and on reaching
there killed the Śūdra and saved the country from a
calamity. The Vimāna was then sent back to Kubera.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
