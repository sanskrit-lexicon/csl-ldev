PUṢPAKA I¦. A divine Aerial Chariot.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Viśvakarmā had a daughter named Saṃjñā.
<div n="lb"/>She was married to Sūrya. But Saṃjñā could not live
<div n="lb"/>with Sūrya for long because of the terrible heat and so
<div n="lb"/>she came back and told her father about it. At once
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā ordered Sūrya to come to him and the
<div n="lb"/>former then tried to reduce his brightness by rubbing
<div n="lb"/>him on a grindstone. However much he tried he was
<div n="lb"/>not able to reduce even an eighth of his brightness.
<div n="lb"/>The brightness of the Sun which was rubbed out spread
<div n="lb"/>in the atmosphere as suspended lustrous particles.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā collected that lustrous dust and from it
<div n="lb"/>created four brilliant things. The Cakrāyudha of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu is one, the Triśūla of Śiva is another, and
<div n="lb"/>the third is Puṣpakavimāna (Puṣpaka Aerial chariot).
<div n="lb"/>The fourth is Śakti, a weapon of Subrahmaṇya. Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>karmā gave them all as presents to Brahmā. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>2, Aṃ a 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Kubera got the Puṣpaka.%} Vaiśravaṇa alias
<div n="lb"/>Kubera was the son born to Viśravas of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Devavarṇinī, daughter of sage Bharadvāja. Viśravas
<div n="lb"/>did penance to please Brahmā to get a son and Vaiś-
<div n="lb"/>ravaṇa was born by the blessing of Brahmā. Kubera
<div n="lb"/>also, even while he was a boy, went to the valley of
<div n="lb"/>Himavān and did penance there. Kubera did penance
<div n="lb"/>for ten thousand years with his head downwards in
<div n="lb"/>cold water and another ten thousand years in Pañcāgni
<div n="lb"/>standing on one leg. At that time Brahmā appeared
<div n="lb"/>in person and asked what boon he wanted. He said he
<div n="lb"/>wanted to be one of the lokapālakas (guardians of the
<div n="lb"/>universe). Granting Kubera that, Brahmā gave him
<div n="lb"/>two treasures named Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi
<div n="lb"/>and also the Puṣpakavimāna. After that Kubera built
<div n="lb"/>a city named Laṅkā on the mountain of Trikūṭa in the
<div n="lb"/>southern ocean and started living there.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Rāvaṇa got the Puṣpaka.%} Viśravas had three
<div n="lb"/>more sons named Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhī-
<div n="lb"/>saṇa. They did penance and acquired divine powers.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa then went to Laṅkā and after defeating Kubera
<div n="lb"/>and sending him north captured Laṅkā and made it
<div n="lb"/>his capital. He also took by force the Puṣpaka from
<div n="lb"/>Kubera.
<div n="NI"/>All the victory marches of Rāvaṇa were in this Puṣpaka.
<div n="lb"/>Once Rāvaṇa was going in his Puṣpaka with a Yakṣa
[Page624-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>beauty kidnapped from Alakāpurī when the girl cried
<div n="lb"/>loudly attracting the attention of Sampāti, a vulture
<div n="lb"/>King. Sampāti attacked Rāvaṇa with his fierce beak
<div n="lb"/>and powerful claws. Rāvaṇa's weapons proved futile
<div n="lb"/>against Sampāti and the bird broke the Puṣpaka into
<div n="lb"/>pieces. But the Vimāna was a divine one and it
<div n="lb"/>regained the original shape and utility soon. All the
<div n="lb"/>weapons of Rāvaṇa were destroyed, the great weapon
<div n="lb"/>Candrahāsa was thrown away. The crown of Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was struck down and trampled upon. With his sharp
<div n="lb"/>beak and piercing claws Sampāti made bruises on the
<div n="lb"/>face of Rāvaṇa. Unable to bear the attack of the
<div n="lb"/>mighty bird Rāvaṇa begged for peace. Sampāti asked
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa to release the Yakṣa girl which Rāvaṇa did at
<div n="lb"/>once. Rāvaṇa then returned to Laṅkā in the Puṣpaka
<div n="lb"/>(Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa). It was in
<div n="lb"/>this Puṣpaka plane that Rāvaṇa kidnapped Sītā. In
<div n="lb"/>the battle that followed, Rāvaṇa was killed and the
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpaka Vimāna came into the possession of Vibhīṣaṇa
<div n="lb"/>who gave it as a gift to Śrī Rāma. Śrī Rāma sent it
<div n="lb"/>back to its original owner, Kubera. But Śrī Rāma used
<div n="lb"/>it again for once.
<div n="NI"/>A śūdra named Śambūka started performing penance
<div n="lb"/>in Rāmarājya as a consequence of which there started a
<div n="lb"/>series of infant deaths in the country. Śrī Rāma knew
<div n="lb"/>the cause and he got down by meditation the Puṣpaka
<div n="lb"/>Vimāna from Kubera. When the plane came from
<div n="lb"/>Kubera Śrī Rāma got into it and flew to the place
<div n="lb"/>where Śambūka was doing penance and on reaching
<div n="lb"/>there killed the Śūdra and saved the country from a
<div n="lb"/>calamity. The Vimāna was then sent back to Kubera.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
