CĀṆAKYA¦ (KAUṬILYA). The famous author of
<div n="lb"/>“Arthaśāstra” a treatise on political economy.
<div n="NI"/>Eastern and western scholars have made exhaustive
<div n="lb"/>researches on this intellectual giant of ancient India,
<div n="lb"/>Cāṇakya. But, nothing definite has yet been established
<div n="lb"/>about his time or life. Indians have accepted as a fact
<div n="lb"/>the traditional legend that he was a minister of Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta, the founder of the Maurya dynasty. It is also
<div n="lb"/>firmly believed that it was this mighty intellect of a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin who made Candragupta a powerful emperor
<div n="lb"/>and steered the ship of his state. The phrase ‘Cāṇakya's
<div n="lb"/>kuṭilanīti’ (crooked tactics) has become proverbial.
<div n="lb"/>Some scholars hold the opinion that he came to be
<div n="lb"/>called ‘Kauṭilya’ because of his Kuṭila (crooked)
<div n="lb"/>tactics; but evidence to establish this view-point is yet
<div n="lb"/>to be adduced.
<div n="NI"/>It is his famous Arthaśāstra, which has made Cāṇakya's
<div n="lb"/>name a world famous one. The great German thinker
<div n="lb"/>Jolly has described the Arthaśāstra as a unique composi-
<div n="lb"/>tion in the Sanskrit language. And, Johann Meyer, the
<div n="lb"/>great western scholar has the following to say about
<div n="lb"/>the book:—
<div n="NI"/>“Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra is not one single text, it is a
<div n="lb"/>collection and collateration of all books in ancient
<div n="lb"/>India. To study the greatness of the theories and
<div n="lb"/>principles contained in it today requires continuous and
<div n="lb"/>constant study at least for twenty years and the un-
<div n="lb"/>remitting efforts of a scholar with unabounded know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge are required.”
[Page169-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Even his name has not yet been confirmed beyond
<div n="lb"/>doubts. Kauṭilya is also called Viṣṇugupta, Cāṇakya,
<div n="lb"/>Dramila, and Aṅgula. Modern researches place the
<div n="lb"/>date of the Arthaśāstra at near about B.C. 400. In
<div n="lb"/>Viśākhadatta's Mudrārāksasa (drama) the name
<div n="lb"/>Kauṭilya is used.
<div n="NI"/>The Authors of Nītiśāstra maintain that the name of
<div n="lb"/>the author of Arthaśāstra was Viṣṇugupta. It may be
<div n="lb"/>gathered from the Mudrārākṣasa that he became famous
<div n="lb"/>as Cāṇakya as he was the son of Caṇaka, and that
<div n="lb"/>he possessed deep erudition in Nītiśāstra, Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra and astrology. There is another legend to the
<div n="lb"/>effect that this brahmin (Cāṇakya) belonged to Kāñcī-
<div n="lb"/>pura and that he migrated to Pāṭalīputra, the seat of
<div n="lb"/>learning and scholarship. As Kāmandaka, who lived
<div n="lb"/>in the fourth century B.C. has eulogised Cāṇakya in
<div n="lb"/>his nītiśāstra it may be surmised that Cāṇakya lived
<div n="lb"/>sometime near about that. Candragupta and Cāṇakya
<div n="lb"/>are referred to in the Viṣṇu and the Vāmana Purāṇas.
<div n="lb"/>Kauṭilya was keen-eyed and scholar par excellence.
<div n="lb"/>“Arthaśāstra” is a great book written by him after
<div n="lb"/>thoroughly examining the viewpoints of previous
<div n="lb"/>scholars, and then establishing his own views and
<div n="lb"/>theories. From the Daśakumāracarita of Daṇḍī (A.D.
<div n="lb"/>700) it may be seen that there are 6000 verses in the
<div n="lb"/>Anuṣṭup metre (eight letters in one line) in the Artha-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra composed by Viṣṇugupta for the use of Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta Maurya. The Artha āstra has been held in praise
<div n="lb"/>by Bāṇabhaṭṭa who lived in the 7th Century, Soma-
<div n="lb"/>devasūri, who lived in the 10th century and also by
<div n="lb"/>Hemacandra, the author of Kāvyānuśāsana, who lived
<div n="lb"/>in the 12th century. The book is a discourse on the
<div n="lb"/>principles and practices that are necessary to establish
<div n="lb"/>a strong government of an ideal empire. Cāṇakya has
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in his book with respect the old scholars like
<div n="lb"/>Manu, Śukra, Bṛhaspati, Nārāyaṇa, Kātyāyana and
<div n="lb"/>Govinda dīkṣita. (For the purāṇic story about Cāṇakya
<div n="lb"/>see Vararuci, Para 6).
