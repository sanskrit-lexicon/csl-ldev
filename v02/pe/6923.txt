SUDARŚANĀ¦ XI. A wife of God Fire. This Sudarśanā
was the daughter of Duryodhana, the son of Durjaya
of the Ikṣvāku dynasty. The mother of Sudarśanā
was Narmadā. It is said that so beautiful a woman as
Sudarśanā had never been born. The God Fire was
once fascinated by the beauty of Sudarśanā who had
been instructed to serve him, and wished to accept her
as his wife. So he informed her of his desire. Being
[Page752-a+ 65]
of a noble race, she said that a virgin ought to be given
away by her parents. The God Fire approached the
father of Sudarśanā and informed him of every thing.
When he knew that the person who made the request
was the God Fire, the king gave his daughter Sudarśanā
as wife to the God. (Duryodhana had another name
Nīla). In the Purāṇas there is another statement also
that Nīla was the ruler of Māhiṣmatī. (See under
Duryodhana II and Agni Para 8).
