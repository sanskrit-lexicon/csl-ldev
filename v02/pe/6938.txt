SUDEVA II¦. A captain of the army of King Ambarīṣa.
<div n="lb"/>He was calm and fearless. Sudeva met with a heroic
<div n="lb"/>death in a battle and attained heaven. Indra gave him
<div n="lb"/>a suitable place. Later Ambarīṣa died and came to
<div n="lb"/>heaven. There he saw his captain Sudeva and was
<div n="lb"/>amazed. He asked Indra how it was that Sudeva was
<div n="lb"/>given a place in heaven. Indra replied that to fight
<div n="lb"/>fearlessly in the battle-field and meet with heroic death,
<div n="lb"/>was a yajña (sacrifice) and that due to this yajña
<div n="lb"/>Sudeva attained heaven. The King asked, when this
[Page753-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>took place. Indra continued:—“Once Ambarīṣa sent
<div n="lb"/>Sudeva to subdue the asuras and giants. Sudeva enter-
<div n="lb"/>ed the battlefield and looked at the vast army of the
<div n="lb"/>enemy. Finding that it was impossible to defeat the
<div n="lb"/>army of giants, he sat down and meditated on Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>who appeared before him and encouraged him. A fierce
<div n="lb"/>battle followed in which Sudeva annihilated the army
<div n="lb"/>of the giants completely and he himself met with a
<div n="lb"/>heroic death. That is how he obtained heaven. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha, Śānti Parva, Chapter 98).
