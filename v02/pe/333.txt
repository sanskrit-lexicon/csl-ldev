AÑJANĀ¦. 1) Mother of Hanūmān—Wife of Kesarī,
the noble monkey and daughter of Kuñjara, the monkey
leader. She was the mother of Hanūmān. Once while
Śiva and Pārvatī were gamboling in the guise of monkeys,
rambling through the woods, Pārvatī became pregnant,
That pregnancy was given to Vāyu. At that time
Añjanā was doing penance for an issue. Vāyu transferred
the pregnancy he had received from Pārvatī to
Añjanā. Thus Añjanā gave birth to Hanūmān. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 66).
<div n="NI"/>Añjanā gave birth to Hanūmān in the woods in a valley
on the southern side of Mahāmeru. She was frightened
at the sight of the child shining like the sun. Hanūmān
began to cry for mother's milk. Añjanā said to Hanū-
mān: “Monkeys are fond of red ripe fruits. There-
fore eat whatever you find in red colour.” Saying this
Añjanā transformed herself into a goddess and went to
Heaven.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pūrvajanma (Previous Birth).%} In her previous
birth Añjanā was a goddess named Puñjikastala (Māna-
garva). As a result of a curse, this goddess was born
as a she-monkey in the Himālaya region. With the birth
of Hanūmān, the curse was lifted. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
