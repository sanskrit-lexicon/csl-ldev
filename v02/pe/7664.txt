[Page803-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>also. Once this hermit happened to forget that he had
<div n="lb"/>left flowers, food and his waterpot on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>river and reaching his hermitage, he asked his son
<div n="lb"/>Nāciketa to fetch them from the bank of the river.
<div n="lb"/>When Nāciketa reached the bank of the river, those
<div n="lb"/>things had been washed down by the current. The son
<div n="lb"/>returned and reported the matter to his father. The
<div n="lb"/>father got angry and cursed his son to death. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>the son lying dead on darbha (mattress made of darbha
<div n="lb"/>grass) the hermit cried aloud. In that flow of tears life
<div n="lb"/>returned to the body and the son woke up as if from
<div n="lb"/>sleep. The father asked the son about the news of the
<div n="lb"/>realm of Yama (the god of death) and the son told the
<div n="lb"/>hermit the news about the world of the dead.
