NAMUCI I¦. A fierce Rākṣasa (giant). It is stated in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza 22, that
<div n="lb"/>this giant was the son of Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Danu. This fierce giant was killed by Indra. There is
<div n="lb"/>a story in the Purāṇas describing how Namuci was
<div n="lb"/>killed.
<div n="NI"/>Under the leadership of Namuci a great army of the
<div n="lb"/>giants invaded the realm of the gods. Indra came with
<div n="lb"/>an army of devas. Though the giants were defeated in
<div n="lb"/>the battle Indra was not able to kill Namuci. To save
<div n="lb"/>himself from the attack of Indra, Namuci got into the
<div n="lb"/>radiance of the Sun and hid himself there. Indra found
<div n="lb"/>him out and made a treaty with him, the conditions of
<div n="lb"/>which were as said by Indra:—
<div n="NI"/>“Oh, noble giant, I will not kill you by wet thing or
<div n="lb"/>dry thing, in the night or in the day. What I say is
<div n="lb"/>true.”
<div n="NI"/>According to this treaty it became impossible for Indra
<div n="lb"/>to kill Namuci either with wet things or with dry things
<div n="lb"/>and either in the day time or in the night. Only when
<div n="lb"/>Indra had agreed to these conditions did Namuci come
<div n="lb"/>out.
<div n="NI"/>The battle continued and Indra drove away Śumbha
<div n="lb"/>and Niśumbha the elder brothers of Namuci, who went
<div n="lb"/>to Pātāla. Indra ran after Namuci and in the evening
<div n="lb"/>Indra found him hiding on the sea shore and killed him
[Page523-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>with the foam of the sea. As Indra had violated the condi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the treaty the severed head of Namuci followed
<div n="lb"/>Indra. With this Indra incurred the sin of Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>hatyā (killing a Brahmin). To get remission from this
<div n="lb"/>sin Indra approached Brahmā. He was advised to bathe
<div n="lb"/>in Aruṇāsaṅgama and doing so Indra got remission of
<div n="lb"/>his sin. From that day onwards Aruṇāsaṅgama became
<div n="lb"/>a holy bath (tīrtha). (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 40).
