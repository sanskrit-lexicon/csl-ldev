DARBHI¦. An ancient hermit. This hermit built a tīrtha
<div n="lb"/>(bath) named Ardhakīla in Kurukṣetra. It is believed
<div n="lb"/>that anybody who bathed in this place and fasted could
<div n="lb"/>learn the mantras (spells and incantations) and become
<div n="lb"/>a Brāhmaṇa. It occurs in the Purāṇas that the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Darbhi has brought the four oceans to this bath. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Stanza 54).
