AŚMOPĀKHYĀNAM¦. This is called Aśmagītā also.
<div n="lb"/>After the great Kurukṣetra battle Vyāsa spoke to
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra to console him and the philosophy he
<div n="lb"/>then expounded is called Aśmopākhyānam. Once King
<div n="lb"/>Janaka asked the great scholar Aśman on the changes
<div n="lb"/>that occur in Man as wealth comes and goes. Aśman
<div n="lb"/>then gave the King the same philosophy which Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>gave to Dharmaputra and Aśman's oration to King
<div n="lb"/>Janaka came to be known as Aśmagītā. (Chapter 28,
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, M.B.).
