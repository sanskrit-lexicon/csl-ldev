NALAKŪBARA¦. A son of Vaiśravaṇa. He had a
<div n="lb"/>brother called Maṇigrīva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Cursing Rāvaṇa,%} It was the time when Rāvaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>ruling over Laṅkā and terrorising the fourteen worlds.
<div n="lb"/>As he was carrying on his conquests, once he came to
<div n="lb"/>a round rock near Kailāsa. It was night. Rambhā had
<div n="lb"/>fixed a rendezvous near the rock that night with
<div n="lb"/>Nalakūbara. The full moon shone bright. The radiance
<div n="lb"/>of the moon rendered Kailāsa and its vicinity most
<div n="lb"/>beautiful. Filled with passion Rāvaṇa could not sleep
<div n="lb"/>at all. In the silence of that calm night he heard the
<div n="lb"/>tinkling of bangles. Rāvaṇa opened his twenty eyes
<div n="lb"/>and looked in that direction. He saw an extremely
<div n="lb"/>beautiful woman clad in splendid garments and orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments going along the way. He ran to her and caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of her hand. She was flurried and confused at his
<div n="lb"/>sudden appearance. So she said, “Oh Lord! I am the
<div n="lb"/>wife of Nalakūbara who is the son of your brother
<div n="lb"/>Kubera. My name is Rambhā. Your brother's son is
<div n="lb"/>your son too. So don't do any harm to your son's wife.”
<div n="lb"/>But Rāvaṇa did not pay any heed to her words. He
<div n="lb"/>lifted her up and placed her on the round rock and
<div n="lb"/>raped her. Before dawn Rambhā, who had become
<div n="lb"/>like the lake of lotus trodden by a mad elephant, went
<div n="lb"/>to Nalakūbara and told him everything. Nalakūbara
[Page520-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>became very angry and cursed Rāvaṇa. “You,
<div n="lb"/>who have become blind with lust, shall not touch a
<div n="lb"/>woman who does not reciprocate your love. If you do
<div n="lb"/>so your head will be split into seven pieces.” It was
<div n="lb"/>because of this curse that Rāvaṇa did not touch Sītā
<div n="lb"/>though she was kept in his harem. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa;
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 28).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Another wife of Nalakūbara.%} It is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, Taraṅga
<div n="lb"/>3, that, of the two daughters, Svayamprabhā and
<div n="lb"/>Somaprabhā of Maya, Somaprabhā was the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Nalakūbara.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The curse of Nārada.%} Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva,
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Kubera were playing with celestial maidens
<div n="lb"/>in the Ganges in nudity, when Nārada came by that
<div n="lb"/>way. The hermit was returning after visiting Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>The moment the celestial maids saw Nārada they put
<div n="lb"/>on their clothes and stood aside bowing before Nārada.
<div n="lb"/>Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva did not see Nārada. They
<div n="lb"/>ran here and there, playing with no clothes on. At
<div n="lb"/>this, Nārada got angry and cursed them that they
<div n="lb"/>would become two “Marutu” trees (Terminalia alata)
<div n="lb"/>on the earth. They became very sad and requested for
<div n="lb"/>liberation from the curse. Nārada told them they
<div n="lb"/>would get liberation from the curse when they saw
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the incarnation of Viṣṇu. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Nalakūbara and his brother took birth near the house
<div n="lb"/>of Nandagopa in Ambāḍi, as double “Marutu” trees.
<div n="lb"/>It was the period of the childhood of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Once
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa swallowed mud, and Yaśodā tied him to a
<div n="lb"/>mortar. The child dragged the mortar to the Marutu
<div n="lb"/>tree and got himself between the double trees. Imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately the trees regained the original forms of
<div n="lb"/>Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva. They paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who blessed them, and both of them
<div n="lb"/>returned to Vaiśravaṇapurī. (Bhāgavata, Skanda 10).
