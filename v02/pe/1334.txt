BṚHASPATI¦. The teacher of the devas (Gods).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The father of Bṛhaspati was Aṅgiras, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā. Brahmā grew amorous, at the sight of
<div n="lb"/>some celestial maids who were present at a sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>performed by Rudra; and he had seminal flow.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā put the semen in fire. From that fire the devas
<div n="lb"/>such as Marīci, Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras and others were born.
<div n="lb"/>The name Aṅgiras was given because he was born out
<div n="lb"/>of aṅgāra (live-coal). Eight sons were born to Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Vasudā. They were Utathya, Bṛhaspati,
<div n="lb"/>Vayasya, Śānti, Ghora, Virūpa, Saṃvarta and Sudh-
<div n="lb"/>anvā. All of them were sages who had attained one-
<div n="lb"/>ness with the supreme Spirit by knowledge, and who
<div n="lb"/>had been free from worldly pain. Of them Bṛhaspati,
<div n="lb"/>Utathya and Saṃvarta became famous through all
<div n="lb"/>the worlds. In some purāṇas Vasudā, the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati, is given the name Śraddhā also.
<div n="NI"/>It is stated that Bṛhaspati had a sister named Āṅgirasī.
<div n="lb"/>She was a follower of the Brahmā cult. She became
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Prabhāsa the last one of the eight Vasus.
<F>1) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 218 that the mother of Bṛhaspati had another name, Śubhā, and that Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati had six more brothers, born later, named Bṛhatkīrti, Bṛhatjyoti, Bṛhadbrahmā, Bṛhadmanā, Bṛhadmantra, and Bṛhadbhāsa and that
<div n="lb"/>Āṅgirasī had the name Bhānumatī also.</F>
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā was her son. (Bhāgavata Skandha 4, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 66).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Is Bṛhaspati the son of Agni?%} In some purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati is described as the son of Agni. Its authority
<div n="lb"/>is given below. Aṅgiras, the father of Bṛhaspati was
<div n="lb"/>once doing penance in his hermitage. When the fire of
<div n="lb"/>penance increased the brightness of the real fire
<div n="lb"/>decreased. Agni (fire) stood before Aṅgiras and said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh Lord! your brightness surpasses mine. From this
<div n="lb"/>day onwards you are the real fire. So you shall be the
<div n="lb"/>first fire and I will be the fire of Prajāpati which is the
<div n="lb"/>second fire.”
<div n="NI"/>Because of this boon of Agni, the devas (gods), recog-
<div n="lb"/>nized Aṅgiras also as a fire-god. So in some Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati is mentioned as the son of Agni (fire-god).
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
[Page162-b+ 62]
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Teacher of the Devas.%} The story of how Bṛhaspati
<div n="lb"/>became the teacher of the devas, is given in the
<div n="lb"/>Bhāṣābhārata, Chapter 76 as shown below:
<div n="NI"/>“The Suras and the asuras (the gods and the demons)
<div n="lb"/>became enemies from time immemorial, regarding the
<div n="lb"/>possession of wealth and prosperity in the three worlds.
<div n="lb"/>To secure victory in the battles the gods made Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati their teacher and likewise the asuras made Śukra
<div n="lb"/>their teacher.”
<div n="NI"/>The devas and asuras began to fight for prosperity
<div n="lb"/>and wealth. At that time the devas selected Bṛhaspati
<div n="lb"/>and the asuras selected Śukra, as their teacher.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The conjugality of Bṛhaspati.%} Tārā was the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati. She was very beautiful. Seeing Candra's
<div n="lb"/>handsome figure she doted on him. There arose several
<div n="lb"/>quarrels over this affair. Finally the devas intervened
<div n="lb"/>and Tārā was given back to Bṛhaspatī. Budha was
<div n="lb"/>born to Candra by Tārā.
<div n="NI"/>The individual called Tāra in the family of the monkeys,
<div n="lb"/>was a son of Bṛhaspati. It is mentioned in Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 17, Stanza 10 as follows,
<div n="lb"/>which proves this fact.
<div n="NI"/>“Bṛhaspati begot the mighty monkey Tāra.” In the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 19, Sūkta 126, it is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned that Bṛhaspati had a daughter named
<div n="lb"/>Romaśā. When her husband teased her Romaśā said
<div n="lb"/>to her husband: “You please come and feel your
<div n="lb"/>hand on my body. Don't think that my organs are
<div n="lb"/>small. Though I am hairy like the goats of Gāndhāra,
<div n="lb"/>I have got all the organs fully grown.” This is the
<div n="lb"/>statement in the Ṛgveda. In the Uttara Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>it is stated that Bṛhaspati had a Brāhmaṇa son named
<div n="lb"/>Kuśadhvaja, and that a daughter named Devavatī was
<div n="lb"/>born to Kuśadhvaja. Devavatī was born from his
<div n="lb"/>mouth while Kuśadhvaja was engaged in devotional
<div n="lb"/>recitation of the Vedas. Sītā was the rebirth of this
<div n="lb"/>Devavatī. It is stated in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 67, Stanza 69, that Droṇa, the son of Bhara-
<div n="lb"/>dvāja, was born from a portion of Bṛhaspati. Kaca was
<div n="lb"/>another son of Bṛhaspati. For full particulars of the
<div n="lb"/>story how Devayānī (daughter of Śukra) hankered
<div n="lb"/>after Kaca, see ‘Kaca’. Mention is made in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 219, Stanza 1,
<div n="lb"/>that Bṛhaspati had a wife called Cāndramasī and that
<div n="lb"/>she gave birth to six Agnis. In Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddhakāṇḍa mention is made that Bṛhaspati had a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Sulekhā. Six sons and a daughter
<div n="lb"/>were born to Cāndramasī. The six sons were six Agnis
<div n="lb"/>(fires): In sacrifices the burnt offerings and the ghee
<div n="lb"/>were the portions meant for the great and mighty fire
<div n="lb"/>Śamyu, the son of Bṛhaspati. It is to satisfy this great
<div n="lb"/>fire which blazes with numberless pointed tongues, that
<div n="lb"/>in sacrifices such as Cāturmāsya, Aśvamedha etc. ani-
<div n="lb"/>mals are slaughtered. The daughter of Dharma was
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Śaṃyu. The name of the wonderful being
<div n="lb"/>(Śamyu's wife) is Satyā. A son named Dīpti and three
<div n="lb"/>daughters were born to Śamyu. The son of Dīpti is
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja who is the recipient of first portion of Ghee
<div n="lb"/>oblated in sacrifice. On all full-moon days offerings
<div n="lb"/>of sacrifices are meant for Bharata. Bharata had a son
<div n="lb"/>named Bhārata and a daughter named Bhāratī. Bharata
<div n="lb"/>the Agni is said to be the son of the Agni who is Prajā-
[Page163-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>pati Bharata. Thus Bharata got the famous name ‘the
<div n="lb"/>great’. Bharata married Vīrā and a son was born to
<div n="lb"/>them called Vīra. This Vīra like Soma is the recipient
<div n="lb"/>of sacrificial ghee, according to the belief of the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas. As this Vīra is the recipient of the second ghee
<div n="lb"/>offered in sacrifice, as Soma, he is known by names
<div n="lb"/>such as Rathaprabhu, Rathadhvāna and Kumbharetas.
<div n="lb"/>Vīra married Sarayū and became the father of Siddhi—
<div n="lb"/>Siddhi the Agnidevatā—who is remembered in all
<div n="lb"/>fire songs. Fire which has no action on prosperity,
<div n="lb"/>fame and vigour has the name Niścyavana. Niścya-
<div n="lb"/>vana praises the earth. Satya is the son of Niścyavana.
<div n="lb"/>Satya which blazes by flame determines time. Satya is
<div n="lb"/>known by another name Niṣkṛti. The Agni Svana
<div n="lb"/>spreads diseases. The Agnis called Vipulaprabha, Yat-
<div n="lb"/>ātmā and Brahmacāri are invoked in simple domestic
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices by Brāhmaṇas. The awful fire Baḍavāgni is
<div n="lb"/>supported by life. The sixth son of Bṛhaspati and Tārā
<div n="lb"/>is called Śvetakṛt. The oblation offered to this Agni
<div n="lb"/>is known as Udadvāra. Svāhā was the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Cāndramasī. Svāhā had three sons. They are three
<div n="lb"/>Agnis called Kāmāgni, Amogha, and Ukthya. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Growing amorous on the wife of elder brother.%} A story
<div n="lb"/>stating how Bṛhaspati begot a son by the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Utathya is given in Skandha 9 of Bhāgavata. Mamatā,
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Utathya, was pregnant. Bṛhaspati had
<div n="lb"/>coition with her when her husband was away. The
<div n="lb"/>mother and the child in the womb who opposed the
<div n="lb"/>act of Bṛhaspati were cursed. Mamatā gave birth to two
<div n="lb"/>children. Fearing that her husband might cast her out
<div n="lb"/>she left the son of Bṛhaspati in the forest and was
<div n="lb"/>about to go, when there was a divine voice from above,
<div n="lb"/>“Mūḍhe, Bharadvājamimam bhara dvājaṃ Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pate.” “You senseless woman, bring up this one born
<div n="lb"/>of the two. Bṛhaspati, bring up this one born of the
<div n="lb"/>two.” Hearing this ethereal voice Bṛhaspati took the
<div n="lb"/>child and gave him the name Bharadvāja and brought
<div n="lb"/>him up. After that the child was given to emperor
<div n="lb"/>Bharata. The famous archer Droṇa was the son of this
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Personation of Bṛhaspati.%} The enmity between the
<div n="lb"/>devas and asuras increased day by day. Śukrācārya
<div n="lb"/>the teacher of the asuras began to do penance before
<div n="lb"/>Śiva in the Himālayas, with a view to get a divine
<div n="lb"/>spell or incantation to destroy the devas. The duration
<div n="lb"/>of the penance was thousand years. Indra came to
<div n="lb"/>know of this secret and sent his daughter Jayantī to
<div n="lb"/>get the spell from Śukra by deceit. She stayed with
<div n="lb"/>Śukra as his disciple and servant. Thousand years passed
<div n="lb"/>by. Śiva appeared before Śukra and gave him the spell,
<div n="lb"/>capable of destroying the devas. When he was about
<div n="lb"/>to return Jayantī accepted him as her husband. Be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of his familiarity with her, of a long standing,
<div n="lb"/>he could not refuse her request. Śukra told her that
<div n="lb"/>he would become her husband, for a period of ten
<div n="lb"/>years and that during that period both of them would
<div n="lb"/>be invisible to the world. Thus the couple began an
<div n="lb"/>invisible life.
<div n="NI"/>Bṛhaspati thought of making the best use of this period.
<div n="lb"/>He personated himself as Śukrācārya and went to the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, who thinking that their teacher had returned
<div n="lb"/>after a long penance gave him a loving and sincere
<div n="lb"/>welcome. Bṛhaspati sat on the seat of Śukrācārya and
<div n="lb"/>began to exhort the asuras in such a manner that
[Page163-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>within the period of ten years he was able to remove
<div n="lb"/>factionalism and hatred from them.
<div n="NI"/>At the expiry of ten years' invisible life Śukra returned
<div n="lb"/>having sent Jayantī away. The asuras saw two Śukras
<div n="lb"/>together and were amazed. They declared that the
<div n="lb"/>real Śukra was he who had been teaching them for the
<div n="lb"/>last ten years. Being dismayed at the ingratitude of the
<div n="lb"/>asuras he cursed them that they would shortly be
<div n="lb"/>destroyed and then left the place. At this juncture
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati also assumed his real form and returned to
<div n="lb"/>heaven. Thus the asuras became a people without a
<div n="lb"/>leader like sheep without a shepherd. At last they
<div n="lb"/>approached their teacher Śukra who became their
<div n="lb"/>teacher again, when they begged for his pardon. But
<div n="lb"/>he said that his curse could not be recalled. But he
<div n="lb"/>gave them absolution by saying that they would regain
<div n="lb"/>their lost power during the time of Manu Sāvarṇi.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Cursing Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa was returning haugh-
<div n="lb"/>ty and proud after having defeated the devas and con-
<div n="lb"/>quered heaven, when Sulekhā the daughter of Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati, got terrified and ran away to hide herself from
<div n="lb"/>him. Rāvaṇa chased her and when she was caught he
<div n="lb"/>tried to ravish her. Bṛhaspati got angry and cursed him.
<div n="lb"/>“You, who have grown rank by the dart of Cupid,
<div n="lb"/>will meet with death by the dart of Rāma”. (Kampa
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bṛhaspati and Hanūmān.%} Añjanā the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān was a servant of Bṛhaspati in her previous
<div n="lb"/>birth. Her name then was Puñjikāsthalī. She once went
<div n="lb"/>to fetch water. At that time many Vidyādhara young
<div n="lb"/>people, both male and female, came there and engaged
<div n="lb"/>in amorous acts. Puñjikāsthalī witnessed these love
<div n="lb"/>scenes for a long time and then returned home. It is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Kampa Rāmāyaṇa that Bṛhaspati
<div n="lb"/>cursed her to be born in the next birth as a female
<div n="lb"/>monkey.
<div n="NI"/>Añjanā gave birth to Hanūmān. When he grew up
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān desired to learn Vedas and Śāstras (scrip-
<div n="lb"/>tures). Hanūmān approached Bṛhaspati to learn from
<div n="lb"/>him. But Bṛhaspati was not prepared to teach a monkey
<div n="lb"/>who jumped about everywhere. The disappointed
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān went to the Sun, who asked him how it
<div n="lb"/>could be done by him as he was engaged in travelling
<div n="lb"/>without stop. Hanūmān said that he would move in
<div n="lb"/>front of the sun always. Thus Hanūmān who had been
<div n="lb"/>rejected by Bṛhaspati became the disciple of the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) It is mentioned in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1, that
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati was the teacher of the hermit Śuka.
<div n="NI"/>(2) In Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 51, it is instructed that
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati should be consecrated in temples as wearing
<div n="lb"/>a necklace of beads (Elaeo carpus seeds) and a water
<div n="lb"/>pot.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Mention is made in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 169, Stanza 21 that Bṛhaspati gave Bhara-
<div n="lb"/>dvāja Āgneyāstra (the arrow of fire).
<div n="NI"/>(4) During the period of emperor Pṛthu, when the
<div n="lb"/>Earth-goddess was changed into a cow the gods employ-
<div n="lb"/>ed Bṛhaspati to milk the cow to obtain the things they
<div n="lb"/>needed. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 69).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Once Bṛhaspati gave Subrahmaṇya a stick as a
<div n="lb"/>present. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 46).
[Page164-a+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>(6) Once Bṛhaspati advised Indra to use sweet words.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 84).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Once Bṛhaspati got angry with Mahāviṣṇu at the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial hall of Uparicaravasu. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 336, Stanza 14).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Bṛhaspati cursed the Jaladevatās (goddesses of
<div n="lb"/>water). (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 242, Stanza 27).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Bṛhaspati and Candra are said to be Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Kings. (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Conclusion.%} Bṛhaspati was a deep thinker and one
<div n="lb"/>who had firm convictions in many matters. He was a
<div n="lb"/>man of vast knowledge. Every movement of the gods
<div n="lb"/>had its origin in the brains of Bṛhaspati. There is no
<div n="lb"/>philosophy which does not contain the exhortations
<div n="lb"/>made by Bhaspati at various times to the devas (gods)
<div n="lb"/>or kings or hermits.
