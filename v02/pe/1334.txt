BṚHASPATI¦. The teacher of the devas (Gods).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The father of Bṛhaspati was Aṅgiras, the
son of Brahmā. Brahmā grew amorous, at the sight of
some celestial maids who were present at a sacrifice
performed by Rudra; and he had seminal flow.
Brahmā put the semen in fire. From that fire the devas
such as Marīci, Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras and others were born.
The name Aṅgiras was given because he was born out
of aṅgāra (live-coal). Eight sons were born to Aṅgiras
by his wife Vasudā. They were Utathya, Bṛhaspati,
Vayasya, Śānti, Ghora, Virūpa, Saṃvarta and Sudh-
anvā. All of them were sages who had attained one-
ness with the supreme Spirit by knowledge, and who
had been free from worldly pain. Of them Bṛhaspati,
Utathya and Saṃvarta became famous through all
the worlds. In some purāṇas Vasudā, the mother of
Bṛhaspati, is given the name Śraddhā also.
<div n="NI"/>It is stated that Bṛhaspati had a sister named Āṅgirasī.
She was a follower of the Brahmā cult. She became
the wife of Prabhāsa the last one of the eight Vasus.
<F>1) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 218 that the mother of Bṛhaspati had another name, Śubhā, and that Bṛhas-
pati had six more brothers, born later, named Bṛhatkīrti, Bṛhatjyoti, Bṛhadbrahmā, Bṛhadmanā, Bṛhadmantra, and Bṛhadbhāsa and that
Āṅgirasī had the name Bhānumatī also.</F>
Viśvakarmā was her son. (Bhāgavata Skandha 4, Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 66).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Is Bṛhaspati the son of Agni?%} In some purāṇas
Bṛhaspati is described as the son of Agni. Its authority
is given below. Aṅgiras, the father of Bṛhaspati was
once doing penance in his hermitage. When the fire of
penance increased the brightness of the real fire
decreased. Agni (fire) stood before Aṅgiras and said
“Oh Lord! your brightness surpasses mine. From this
day onwards you are the real fire. So you shall be the
first fire and I will be the fire of Prajāpati which is the
second fire.”
<div n="NI"/>Because of this boon of Agni, the devas (gods), recog-
nized Aṅgiras also as a fire-god. So in some Purāṇas
Bṛhaspati is mentioned as the son of Agni (fire-god).
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
[Page162-b+ 62]
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Teacher of the Devas.%} The story of how Bṛhaspati
became the teacher of the devas, is given in the
Bhāṣābhārata, Chapter 76 as shown below:
<div n="NI"/>“The Suras and the asuras (the gods and the demons)
became enemies from time immemorial, regarding the
possession of wealth and prosperity in the three worlds.
To secure victory in the battles the gods made Bṛhas-
pati their teacher and likewise the asuras made Śukra
their teacher.”
<div n="NI"/>The devas and asuras began to fight for prosperity
and wealth. At that time the devas selected Bṛhaspati
and the asuras selected Śukra, as their teacher.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The conjugality of Bṛhaspati.%} Tārā was the wife of
Bṛhaspati. She was very beautiful. Seeing Candra's
handsome figure she doted on him. There arose several
quarrels over this affair. Finally the devas intervened
and Tārā was given back to Bṛhaspatī. Budha was
born to Candra by Tārā.
<div n="NI"/>The individual called Tāra in the family of the monkeys,
was a son of Bṛhaspati. It is mentioned in Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 17, Stanza 10 as follows,
which proves this fact.
<div n="NI"/>“Bṛhaspati begot the mighty monkey Tāra.” In the
Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 19, Sūkta 126, it is
mentioned that Bṛhaspati had a daughter named
Romaśā. When her husband teased her Romaśā said
to her husband: “You please come and feel your
hand on my body. Don't think that my organs are
small. Though I am hairy like the goats of Gāndhāra,
I have got all the organs fully grown.” This is the
statement in the Ṛgveda. In the Uttara Rāmāyaṇa,
it is stated that Bṛhaspati had a Brāhmaṇa son named
Kuśadhvaja, and that a daughter named Devavatī was
born to Kuśadhvaja. Devavatī was born from his
mouth while Kuśadhvaja was engaged in devotional
recitation of the Vedas. Sītā was the rebirth of this
Devavatī. It is stated in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 67, Stanza 69, that Droṇa, the son of Bhara-
dvāja, was born from a portion of Bṛhaspati. Kaca was
another son of Bṛhaspati. For full particulars of the
story how Devayānī (daughter of Śukra) hankered
after Kaca, see ‘Kaca’. Mention is made in
Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 219, Stanza 1,
that Bṛhaspati had a wife called Cāndramasī and that
she gave birth to six Agnis. In Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddhakāṇḍa mention is made that Bṛhaspati had a
daughter named Sulekhā. Six sons and a daughter
were born to Cāndramasī. The six sons were six Agnis
(fires): In sacrifices the burnt offerings and the ghee
were the portions meant for the great and mighty fire
Śamyu, the son of Bṛhaspati. It is to satisfy this great
fire which blazes with numberless pointed tongues, that
in sacrifices such as Cāturmāsya, Aśvamedha etc. ani-
mals are slaughtered. The daughter of Dharma was
the wife of Śaṃyu. The name of the wonderful being
(Śamyu's wife) is Satyā. A son named Dīpti and three
daughters were born to Śamyu. The son of Dīpti is
Bharadvāja who is the recipient of first portion of Ghee
oblated in sacrifice. On all full-moon days offerings
of sacrifices are meant for Bharata. Bharata had a son
named Bhārata and a daughter named Bhāratī. Bharata
the Agni is said to be the son of the Agni who is Prajā-
[Page163-a+ 65]
pati Bharata. Thus Bharata got the famous name ‘the
great’. Bharata married Vīrā and a son was born to
them called Vīra. This Vīra like Soma is the recipient
of sacrificial ghee, according to the belief of the Brāh-
maṇas. As this Vīra is the recipient of the second ghee
offered in sacrifice, as Soma, he is known by names
such as Rathaprabhu, Rathadhvāna and Kumbharetas.
Vīra married Sarayū and became the father of Siddhi—
Siddhi the Agnidevatā—who is remembered in all
fire songs. Fire which has no action on prosperity,
fame and vigour has the name Niścyavana. Niścya-
vana praises the earth. Satya is the son of Niścyavana.
Satya which blazes by flame determines time. Satya is
known by another name Niṣkṛti. The Agni Svana
spreads diseases. The Agnis called Vipulaprabha, Yat-
ātmā and Brahmacāri are invoked in simple domestic
sacrifices by Brāhmaṇas. The awful fire Baḍavāgni is
supported by life. The sixth son of Bṛhaspati and Tārā
is called Śvetakṛt. The oblation offered to this Agni
is known as Udadvāra. Svāhā was the daughter of
Cāndramasī. Svāhā had three sons. They are three
Agnis called Kāmāgni, Amogha, and Ukthya. (Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Growing amorous on the wife of elder brother.%} A story
stating how Bṛhaspati begot a son by the wife of
Utathya is given in Skandha 9 of Bhāgavata. Mamatā,
the wife of Utathya, was pregnant. Bṛhaspati had
coition with her when her husband was away. The
mother and the child in the womb who opposed the
act of Bṛhaspati were cursed. Mamatā gave birth to two
children. Fearing that her husband might cast her out
she left the son of Bṛhaspati in the forest and was
about to go, when there was a divine voice from above,
“Mūḍhe, Bharadvājamimam bhara dvājaṃ Bṛhas-
pate.” “You senseless woman, bring up this one born
of the two. Bṛhaspati, bring up this one born of the
two.” Hearing this ethereal voice Bṛhaspati took the
child and gave him the name Bharadvāja and brought
him up. After that the child was given to emperor
Bharata. The famous archer Droṇa was the son of this
Bharadvāja.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Personation of Bṛhaspati.%} The enmity between the
devas and asuras increased day by day. Śukrācārya
the teacher of the asuras began to do penance before
Śiva in the Himālayas, with a view to get a divine
spell or incantation to destroy the devas. The duration
of the penance was thousand years. Indra came to
know of this secret and sent his daughter Jayantī to
get the spell from Śukra by deceit. She stayed with
Śukra as his disciple and servant. Thousand years passed
by. Śiva appeared before Śukra and gave him the spell,
capable of destroying the devas. When he was about
to return Jayantī accepted him as her husband. Be-
cause of his familiarity with her, of a long standing,
he could not refuse her request. Śukra told her that
he would become her husband, for a period of ten
years and that during that period both of them would
be invisible to the world. Thus the couple began an
invisible life.
<div n="NI"/>Bṛhaspati thought of making the best use of this period.
He personated himself as Śukrācārya and went to the
Asuras, who thinking that their teacher had returned
after a long penance gave him a loving and sincere
welcome. Bṛhaspati sat on the seat of Śukrācārya and
began to exhort the asuras in such a manner that
[Page163-b+ 64]
within the period of ten years he was able to remove
factionalism and hatred from them.
<div n="NI"/>At the expiry of ten years' invisible life Śukra returned
having sent Jayantī away. The asuras saw two Śukras
together and were amazed. They declared that the
real Śukra was he who had been teaching them for the
last ten years. Being dismayed at the ingratitude of the
asuras he cursed them that they would shortly be
destroyed and then left the place. At this juncture
Bṛhaspati also assumed his real form and returned to
heaven. Thus the asuras became a people without a
leader like sheep without a shepherd. At last they
approached their teacher Śukra who became their
teacher again, when they begged for his pardon. But
he said that his curse could not be recalled. But he
gave them absolution by saying that they would regain
their lost power during the time of Manu Sāvarṇi.
(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Cursing Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa was returning haugh-
ty and proud after having defeated the devas and con-
quered heaven, when Sulekhā the daughter of Bṛhas-
pati, got terrified and ran away to hide herself from
him. Rāvaṇa chased her and when she was caught he
tried to ravish her. Bṛhaspati got angry and cursed him.
“You, who have grown rank by the dart of Cupid,
will meet with death by the dart of Rāma”. (Kampa
Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bṛhaspati and Hanūmān.%} Añjanā the mother of
Hanūmān was a servant of Bṛhaspati in her previous
birth. Her name then was Puñjikāsthalī. She once went
to fetch water. At that time many Vidyādhara young
people, both male and female, came there and engaged
in amorous acts. Puñjikāsthalī witnessed these love
scenes for a long time and then returned home. It is
mentioned in Kampa Rāmāyaṇa that Bṛhaspati
cursed her to be born in the next birth as a female
monkey.
<div n="NI"/>Añjanā gave birth to Hanūmān. When he grew up
Hanūmān desired to learn Vedas and Śāstras (scrip-
tures). Hanūmān approached Bṛhaspati to learn from
him. But Bṛhaspati was not prepared to teach a monkey
who jumped about everywhere. The disappointed
Hanūmān went to the Sun, who asked him how it
could be done by him as he was engaged in travelling
without stop. Hanūmān said that he would move in
front of the sun always. Thus Hanūmān who had been
rejected by Bṛhaspati became the disciple of the Sun.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).

Bṛhaspati was the teacher of the hermit Śuka.
<div n="NI"/>(2) In Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 51, it is instructed that
Bṛhaspati should be consecrated in temples as wearing
a necklace of beads (Elaeo carpus seeds) and a water
pot.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Mention is made in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,

dvāja Āgneyāstra (the arrow of fire).
<div n="NI"/>(4) During the period of emperor Pṛthu, when the
Earth-goddess was changed into a cow the gods employ-
ed Bṛhaspati to milk the cow to obtain the things they
needed. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 69).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Once Bṛhaspati gave Subrahmaṇya a stick as a
present. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 46).

who had firm convictions in many matters. He was a
man of vast knowledge. Every movement of the gods
had its origin in the brains of Bṛhaspati. There is no
philosophy which does not contain the exhortations
made by Bhaspati at various times to the devas (gods)
or kings or hermits.
