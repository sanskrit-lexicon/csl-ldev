PARĀŚARA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—Brahmā
-Vasiṣṭha—Śakti—Parāśara.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śakti, son of Vasiṣṭha begot of his wife
Adṛṣyantī the son named Parāśara. Even at the time of
his birth he was a scholar. (For details regarding birth
see under Adṛśyanṭī).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Rākṣasayāga.%} Even before the birth of Parāśara,
Kalmāṣapāda in his demoniacal form ate his father,
Śakti. Therefore Parāśara nurtured an obstinate hatred
against the Rākṣasas. So he performed a Yāga to kill
all the rākṣasas. Thousands of rākṣasas were burnt to
death at this yāga and Vasiṣṭha, grandfather of
Parāśara felt sorry for the innocent rākṣasas. He
approached Parāśara and said “Son, do not give way
to such anger. Abandon this wrath. What harm have
these poor rākṣasas done? Death was in the destiny of
your father. Every one has to suffer the result of his
own deeds. Anger destroys the fame and austerity which
one has attained by years of toil. Therefore abandon
your anger and wind up your Yāga.”
<div n="NI"/>Parāśara accepted the advice of his grandfather.
Vasiṣṭha was pleased with his grandson and at that
time Pulastyamaharṣi son of Brahmā also came there.
Vasiṣṭha gave arghya (water and flowers) and received
him. Then Vasiṣṭha and Pulastya jointly blessed him
and said he would be the author of Purāṇasaṃhitā.
Thus Parāśara became the best of the Guruparamparā
(traditional line of preceptors). (Chapter 1, Aṃśa 1,
Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Vyāsa.%} Parāśara begot a son of a fisher-
woman named Satyavatī and the boy became later the
celebrated Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}

womb of his mother he consoled Vasiṣṭha when his son
Śakti, father of Parāśara was eaten by the demoniac
