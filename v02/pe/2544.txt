GURUPARAMPARĀ¦. The origin of the Vedas and the
<div n="lb"/>lineage of Gurus is given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin of the Vedas.%} At the time of creation the
<div n="lb"/>Veda was born from the face of God. It contained a
<div n="lb"/>lakh of granthas with four pādas like Ṛk. From the
<div n="lb"/>Veda were born the ten yajñas. The Veda was origi-
<div n="lb"/>nally one. It was Vyāsa who divided it into four divi-
<div n="lb"/>sions resulting in the four Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>Vyāsa divided the Vedas thus: When Brahmā command-
<div n="lb"/>ed Vyāsa to divide the Vedas into divisions he first
<div n="lb"/>selected four disciples who could see the end of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas. He accepted Paila to study Ṛgveda, Vaiśaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>pāyana to study Yajurveda, Jaimini to study Sāmaveda
<div n="lb"/>and Sumantu to study Atharvaveda. Besides these he
<div n="lb"/>selected the highly intelligent Romaharṣaṇa alias Sūta
<div n="lb"/>to study the Itihāsas and Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>At first, the Veda was one. Vyāsa divided it into four.
<div n="lb"/>He based the division on the cāturhotra, performance of
[Page305-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>four hotṛs. He arranged the performance of Adhvaryu
<div n="lb"/>as Yajus, that of hotṛ as Ṛks, that of Udgātṛ as Sāmans
<div n="lb"/>and that of Brahmā as Atharvans. Then he separated
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛks to form Ṛgveda, Yajus to form Yajurveda and
<div n="lb"/>Sāmans to form Sāmaveda. He devoted Atharvaveda to
<div n="lb"/>specify the rites and duties of Kings and the deeds of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Vedavyāsa thus split the single Veda tree into
<div n="lb"/>four and from there arose later a forest of Veda trees.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The saints of Ṛgveda.%} Paila divided Ṛgveda into
<div n="lb"/>two saṃhitās and gave one each to Indrapramati and
<div n="lb"/>Bāṣkala. Sage Bāṣkala divided his Saṃhitā again into
<div n="lb"/>four and taught it to four of his disciples, Bodhi, Ādimā-
<div n="lb"/>ḍhava, Yājñavalkya and Parāśara. Indrapramati with-
<div n="lb"/>out splitting his saṃhitā taught it to his renowned son,
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍūkeya. The branch of Indrapramati thus went
<div n="lb"/>down into circulation through the disciples of Māṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍūkeya and the disciples of the disciples and so on.
<div n="lb"/>Vedamitra of Śākalya gotra, one sage in the line of the
<div n="lb"/>disciples of Māṇḍūkeya, split the saṃhitā into five, and
<div n="lb"/>taught it to Mudgala, Gomukha, Vātsya, Śālīya and
<div n="lb"/>Śarīra. Śākapūrṇa a colleague of Vedamitra divided it
<div n="lb"/>into three and added a division to it by composing a
<div n="lb"/>Nirukta of his own. He taught them to Vaitālika,
<div n="lb"/>Balāka and Krauñca. This was how the Indrapramati
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā produced branches and sub-branches. Bāṣkala
<div n="lb"/>divided his saṃhitā into another set of three and taught
<div n="lb"/>it to Kālāyani, Gārgya, and Kathājava. The sages
<div n="lb"/>mentioned above are the ones who spread Ṛgveda in
<div n="lb"/>the world.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Saints of Yajurveda.%} Vaiśampāyana, disciple of Veda
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa, made twentyseven divisions of Yajurveda and
<div n="lb"/>taught them to his disciples. Among those disciples was
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya, son of Brahmarāta. The branch Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>originated from Yājñavalkya.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Taittirīya branch.%} Once all the sages learned in
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas made a decision. He who does not attend the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmasamāja meeting held at the mountain of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru will be tainted with the sin of Brahmahatyā
<div n="lb"/>(murder of a brahmin). At one time Vaiśampāyana
<div n="lb"/>was not able to attend and so was charged with the sin
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmahatyā. He called his disciples to his side and
<div n="lb"/>told them that they should observe a Vrata to absolve
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśampāyana of his sin. Then one of his disciples,
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya, stood up and said that he would observe
<div n="lb"/>the vrata alone and that there was no need of anybody
<div n="lb"/>else in that matter. When asked why he said so he
<div n="lb"/>replied that none of the colleagues of his was so bril-
<div n="lb"/>liant and majestic as he was. Vaiśampāyana did not
<div n="lb"/>like this arrogance of Yājñavalkya and so angrily
<div n="lb"/>commanded Yājñavalkya to give back all that had been
<div n="lb"/>taught to him by Vaiśampāyana. Obeying orders Yājña-
<div n="lb"/>valkya vomited all the yajus and went away from the
<div n="lb"/>place. The other sages taking the form of the bird,
<div n="lb"/>Tittiri, accepted the vomited yajus. Therefore that
<div n="lb"/>branch of the Veda got the name of Taittirīya and
<div n="lb"/>those sages were known as the Taittirīyas.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ayātayāma(s).%} On his leaving Vaiśampāyana
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya put into operation a new set of Yajus
<div n="lb"/>called Ayātayāma unknown even to Vaiśampāyana.
<div n="lb"/>This was how it happened. Yājñavalkya after leaving
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmasamāja went and did penance to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>the Sun-god. The Sun appeared before him in the form
<div n="lb"/>of a horse. Yājñavalkya then requested him to grant
<div n="lb"/>him new yajus unknown even to Vaiśampāyana.
[Page305-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>The Sun then remaining in the shape of the horse
<div n="lb"/>(Vāji) itself imparted to him instructions on a new
<div n="lb"/>set of Yajus called Ayātayāma which were not known
<div n="lb"/>to anybody else, even to Vaiśampāyana. Those who
<div n="lb"/>studied it were called Vājis. There are fifteen branches
<div n="lb"/>of the Vājis, Kānnu being one of them. All were put
<div n="lb"/>into operation by Yājñavalkya.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The Sannyāsins of Sāmaveda.%} Vedavyāsa taught Sāma-
<div n="lb"/>veda to Jaimini. Jaimini had a son, Sumantu, and he in
<div n="lb"/>turn had a son named Sutva. Sumantu and Sutva
<div n="lb"/>were very intelligent and they studied one branch each
<div n="lb"/>of the Vedas. Sutva had a son, Sukarmā, and he
<div n="lb"/>divided Sāmavedasaṃhitā into a thousand branches.
<div n="lb"/>Sukarmā had two disciples: Hiraṇyanābha and Pauṣ-
<div n="lb"/>piñji, and both of them studied all the thousand
<div n="lb"/>divisions of the Sāmaveda. The five hundred disciples
<div n="lb"/>of Hiraṇyanābha who came from the north and studied
<div n="lb"/>Sāmaveda were called Udīcya Sāmagas (those come from
<div n="lb"/>the north). Another five hundred came from the east
<div n="lb"/>and studied Sāmavedasaṃhitā from Hiraṇyanābha and
<div n="lb"/>they were called Prācya sāmagas. (Hiraṇyanābha is
<div n="lb"/>known as Kauśalya also.) Pauṣpiñji had four disciples:
<div n="lb"/>Logākṣi, Kauthumi, Kakṣīvān and Lāṅgali. These four
<div n="lb"/>and their disciples split their saṃhitās and increased
<div n="lb"/>them. Kṛti, one of the disciples of Hiraṇyanābha,
<div n="lb"/>taught his disciples twentyfour saṃhitās. They also
<div n="lb"/>split them into many more and made the Sāmaveda
<div n="lb"/>bigger.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The saints of Atharvaveda.%} Vyāsa taught Atharvaveda
<div n="lb"/>to Sumantu. Sage Sumantu taught it to his disciple
<div n="lb"/>Kabandha first. Kabandha split it into two and gave
<div n="lb"/>one each to his disciples: Devādarśa and Pathya. Deva
<div n="lb"/>had four discīples: Medhā Brahmabali, Śāntakāyani and
<div n="lb"/>Pippalāda. Pathya had three: Jābāli, Kumuda and
<div n="lb"/>Śaunaka. All these made saṃhitās. Śaunaka split his
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā into two and taught one to Badru and another
<div n="lb"/>to Saindhava. Muñjikeśa learnt it from Saindhava. He
<div n="lb"/>split it into two first and then again into three. The five
<div n="lb"/>śaṃhitās of Muñjikeśa namely, Nakṣatrakalpa, Veda-
<div n="lb"/>kalpa, Saṃhitākalpa, Āṅgirasakalpa and Śāntikalpa are
<div n="lb"/>the most important divisions of the Atharvaveda. The
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatrakalpa contains methods of worshipping Nak-
<div n="lb"/>ṣatras; the Vedakalpa contains the rites of the Ṛtvik
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, and the Saṃhitākalpa contains the science of
<div n="lb"/>the care of horses and elephants.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Purāṇas.%} Vyāsa compiled a Purāṇa saṃhitā using
<div n="lb"/>speeches, appendices, poems and Kalpanirṇayas and tau-
<div n="lb"/>ght it to Romaharṣaṇa alias Sūta. Sūta had six disciples
<div n="lb"/>named Sumati, Agnivarcas, Mitrāyus, Sāṃśapāyana,
<div n="lb"/>Akṛtavraṇa, and Sāvarṇi. Akṛtavraṇa, Sāvarṇi and Śāṃ-
<div n="lb"/>śapāyana born of Kaśyapagotra have themselves made
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇasaṃhitās. There is another saṃhitā composed
<div n="lb"/>by Romaharṣaṇa based on the saṃhītās made by the
<div n="lb"/>above three.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa is based on the latter four saṃhitās. There
<div n="lb"/>are eighteen Purāṇas, namely, Āgneya, Brāhma, Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>ṇḍa, Brahmavaivarta, Bhāgavata, Bhaviṣya, Garuḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Kūrma, Liṅga, Mārkaṇḍeya, Matsya, Nāradīya, Padma,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, Skanda, Vāmana, Varāha and Viṣṇu. There are
<div n="lb"/>eighteen sub Purāṇas also. In all these are described the
<div n="lb"/>creation, the deluge, the dynasties of the devas, history
<div n="lb"/>of kingly dynasties, changes of generations etc. (Aṃśa
<div n="lb"/>3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa; 12th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
