GHAṬA¦. A notorious thief. He had a friend called
Karpara. They were jointly known as Ghāṭakarparas.
Once both the friends went to commit theft. Leaving
Ghaṭa at the door-steps Karpara entered the chamber
of the princess who after enjoying sexual pleasures
with him gave him some money asking him to repeat
such visits in future. Karpara told Ghaṭa all that had
happened and handed over to him the money which the
princess had given him. Karpara went again to the
princess. But, owing to the weariness caused by the
night's enjoyment both the princess and he slept till late
in the morning. Meantime the palace guards found out
the secret and took the lovers into custody. Karpara
was sentenced to death and led out to be hanged. Ghaṭa
was present on the spot and Karpara asked him secretly
to save the princess. Accordingly Ghaṭa, without any-
body knowing about it, took the princess over to his
house.
<div n="NI"/>The King ordered enquiries about the absence of the
princess. Under the natural presumption that some
relation or other of Karpara alone might have carried
away his daughter the King ordered the guards of Kar-
para's corpse to arrest anybody who approached the
corpse and expressed grief. Ghaṭa came to know of this
secret order of the King. Next day evening Ghaṭa posing
himself as a drunkard and with a servant disguised as

is used because the brothers were inseparable from each other.</F>

a woman walking in front and with another servant
carrying rice mixed with dhatūrā (a poisonous fruit)
following him came to the guards keeping watch over
Karpara's body. Ghaṭa gave the poisoned rice to the
guards who after eating it swooned under the effect.
Ghaṭa used the opportunity to burn the corpse of
Karpara there itself. After that Ghaṭa disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>The King then deputed new guards to watch over the
funeral pyre of Karpara as he anticipated some one to
come to pick his charred bones from the pyre. But,
Ghaṭa put the guards into a swoon by a mantra he had
learned from a sannyāsin and went away with the bones
of his friend.
<div n="NI"/>Realising now that further stay there was not safe Ghaṭa
left the place with the princess and the sannyāsin. But,
the princess, who had already fallen in love with the
sannyāsin poisoned Ghaṭa to death.
