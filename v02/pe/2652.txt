HAYAGRĪVA IV¦. A saintly king. Though he defeat-
ed his enemies, yet, as he had no backing and support,
he was finally killed. The story of Hayagrīva was told
by Vyāsa to teach Dharmaputra the lesson that even
the greatest of heroes requires the support of others.
Though killed, Hayagrīva secured a place in heaven.
(Śānti Parva, Chapter 24, Verse 23).
