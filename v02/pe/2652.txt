HAYAGRĪVA IV¦. A saintly king. Though he defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed his enemies, yet, as he had no backing and support,
<div n="lb"/>he was finally killed. The story of Hayagrīva was told
<div n="lb"/>by Vyāsa to teach Dharmaputra the lesson that even
<div n="lb"/>the greatest of heroes requires the support of others.
<div n="lb"/>Though killed, Hayagrīva secured a place in heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 24, Verse 23).
