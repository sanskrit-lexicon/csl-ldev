KUŚADHVAJA I¦. A brahmin, son of Bṛhaspati. Penni-
less and poor, the brahmin once sought the help of
King Sālva. The miserly king did not give him any-
thing. Thereafter he began worshipping Bhagavatī
with the object of making some money. While medita-
ting upon Bhagavatī a girl emerged out of his mouth.
She was named Devavatī. When she came of age an
asura called Śambhu desired to marry her; but Kuśa-
dhvaja did not agree to the proposal. Enraged at the
refusal Śambhu killed Kuśadhvaja while the latter was
asleep one night. But Devavatī cursed and reduced
the asura into ashes. Then she took herself to penance
to secure Mahāviṣṇu as her husband when Rāvaṇa
happened to come there, and he tried to make her his
wife. But, she repelled all his attempts at which he
caught hold of her by the hair. She escaped by cutting
her hair. She then immolated herself in burning fire.
It was this Devavatī, who was, in her next life, born as
Sītā, daughter of King Janaka (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
