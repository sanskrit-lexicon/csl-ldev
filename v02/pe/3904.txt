KUŚADHVAJA I¦. A brahmin, son of Bṛhaspati. Penni-
<div n="lb"/>less and poor, the brahmin once sought the help of
<div n="lb"/>King Sālva. The miserly king did not give him any-
<div n="lb"/>thing. Thereafter he began worshipping Bhagavatī
<div n="lb"/>with the object of making some money. While medita-
<div n="lb"/>ting upon Bhagavatī a girl emerged out of his mouth.
<div n="lb"/>She was named Devavatī. When she came of age an
<div n="lb"/>asura called Śambhu desired to marry her; but Kuśa-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja did not agree to the proposal. Enraged at the
<div n="lb"/>refusal Śambhu killed Kuśadhvaja while the latter was
<div n="lb"/>asleep one night. But Devavatī cursed and reduced
<div n="lb"/>the asura into ashes. Then she took herself to penance
<div n="lb"/>to secure Mahāviṣṇu as her husband when Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>happened to come there, and he tried to make her his
<div n="lb"/>wife. But, she repelled all his attempts at which he
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of her by the hair. She escaped by cutting
<div n="lb"/>her hair. She then immolated herself in burning fire.
<div n="lb"/>It was this Devavatī, who was, in her next life, born as
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, daughter of King Janaka (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
