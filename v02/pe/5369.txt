PRATĪPA¦. A King of Candravaṃśa (Lunar dynasty).
He was the father of King Śantanu. There is a story
behind the birth of the son Śantanu to Pratīpa.
<div n="NI"/>One day this Rājarṣi was worshipping the Sun-god in
the waters of the river Gaṅgā, when a beautiful
maiden rose from the waters and sat on the right thigh
of the royal ascetic. The King was embarrassed and
he told her thus:—“Oh sweet girl, who are you?
Do you realise what an unrighteous deed you have
done? Why did you thus climb on my thigh without
seeking my permission? The right thigh is for the
daughter and the wife of the son. Since you have thus
sat on my right thigh, you shall be the wife of my son
when one is born to me.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this the maiden jumped out from the thigh of
the King and left the place and the King went to his
palace. After some time Pratīpa got a son named
Śantanu. Śantanu was none other than emperor
Mahābhiṣak who was forced to be born on earth due
to a curse of Brahmā. When Śantanu came of age
Pratīpa decided to spend the rest of his life in forests
and calling his son to his side gave him all advice and
added “Son, perhaps a maiden may come to you and
if she comes accept her as your wife. Do not ask her
about her identity. By making her your truthful wife
you will acquire a great many benefits.”
<div n="NI"/>Pratīpa, thereafter, entrusted the kingdom to his son and
after performing severe penance in the forests attained
divyaloka. (2nd Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
