PRATĪPA¦. A King of Candravaṃśa (Lunar dynasty).
<div n="lb"/>He was the father of King Śantanu. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>behind the birth of the son Śantanu to Pratīpa.
<div n="NI"/>One day this Rājarṣi was worshipping the Sun-god in
<div n="lb"/>the waters of the river Gaṅgā, when a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>maiden rose from the waters and sat on the right thigh
<div n="lb"/>of the royal ascetic. The King was embarrassed and
<div n="lb"/>he told her thus:—“Oh sweet girl, who are you?
<div n="lb"/>Do you realise what an unrighteous deed you have
<div n="lb"/>done? Why did you thus climb on my thigh without
<div n="lb"/>seeking my permission? The right thigh is for the
<div n="lb"/>daughter and the wife of the son. Since you have thus
<div n="lb"/>sat on my right thigh, you shall be the wife of my son
<div n="lb"/>when one is born to me.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this the maiden jumped out from the thigh of
<div n="lb"/>the King and left the place and the King went to his
<div n="lb"/>palace. After some time Pratīpa got a son named
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu. Śantanu was none other than emperor
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhiṣak who was forced to be born on earth due
<div n="lb"/>to a curse of Brahmā. When Śantanu came of age
<div n="lb"/>Pratīpa decided to spend the rest of his life in forests
<div n="lb"/>and calling his son to his side gave him all advice and
<div n="lb"/>added “Son, perhaps a maiden may come to you and
<div n="lb"/>if she comes accept her as your wife. Do not ask her
<div n="lb"/>about her identity. By making her your truthful wife
<div n="lb"/>you will acquire a great many benefits.”
<div n="NI"/>Pratīpa, thereafter, entrusted the kingdom to his son and
<div n="lb"/>after performing severe penance in the forests attained
<div n="lb"/>divyaloka. (2nd Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
