DUNDUBHI I¦. A terrible asura, son of Maya and
brother of Māyāvī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Dānavas were the offsprings of Kaśyapa,
grandson of Brahmā and son of Marīci by his wife
Danu, daughter of Dakṣaprajāpati. Maya, chief among
the Dānavas earned great reputation as a unique archi-
tect. Once Maya attended a dance programme in
devaloka where he fell in love with Hemā dancing with
the deva-women. When the dance was over Maya told
Hemā about his love for her. Hemā too had fallen in
love with Maya. And they left the place in secret and
reached the southern slope of the Himālayas where they
built a beautiful city called Hemapura and they lived
there. Ere long they-had two sons, Dundubhi and
Māyāvī, both of them equally distinguished in prowess.
Uttararāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Dundubhi's relationship with Rāvaṇa.%} Maya did tapas
for a daughter in the western plains of Mount Kailāsa.
One of those days Pārvatī went out of Kailāsa to feed
brahmins in celebration of the birthday of Subrah-
maṇya. In the absence of Pārvatī a deva woman called
Madhurā who had observed the Somavāravrata came
to Kailāsa to salute Mahādeva (Śiva) who enjoyed her
for some time. On her return to Śiva Pārvatī noticed
ashes worn by him transferred to the breasts of
Madhurā. Drawing the natural inference from this
Pārvatī got angry and cursed Madhurā to be transform-
[Page253-b+ 65]
ed into a frog. Then Śiva blessed her that she would
regain her former self after twelve years and have a
heroic husband. Madhurā who was thus turned into a
frog fell into a well close to where Maya was engaged
in tapas. And, after twelve years, the frog regained its
former form and became Madhurā again. Maya, who
saw her adopted her as daughter and brought her up as
such calling her Mandodarī. Mandodarī became Rāv-
aṇa’ wife and thus Dundubhi became the brother-in-law
of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Dundubhi grew up.%} The following is told about Dun-
dubhi in Canto 11, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>As beautiful and majestic as the peak of Mount Kailāsa,
the heroic Dundubhi possessed the form of the buffalo.
And, he had the strength of a thousand elephants.
Proud and haughty over his own prowess and losing his
head over the boon he had received from God, Dundu-
bhi went to fight with the ocean, the lord of rivers. (It
was Śiva who gave him boons. See M.B. Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Fight with Bāli and death.%} Haughty almost to mad-
ness over the unrivalled strength and prowess he got as
the result of the boon, Dundubhi went about challeng-
ing whomsoever he met for a fight. But none dared to
accept the challenge. Then he went to the sea-shore
and challenged Varuṇa, who, appearing on the crest
of the waves said: “I am not strong and powerful
enough to fight with you. Only Himavān can do that.
So, please go north.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Dundubhi went north to Himavān and
challenged him in great rage. Himavān clad in his neat
and white apparel appeared and spoke in humble tones:
“Oh mighty Dānava: I am not accustomed to fighting
war. My job is only to arrange necessary conveni-
ence to saints and sages. But, there is in southern India
a very powerful monkey called Bāli, who is the King of
Kiṣkindhā, and Bāli alone can combat with you.
<div n="NI"/>And, Dundubhi accordingly went southward to Kiṣkin-
dhā and challenged Bāli. Terrible as the dark clouds in
the sky the dānava who possessed the body and
horns of the buffalo—began roaring like hell at the tower
gates of Kiṣkindhā, uprooting trees with his horn and
tearing the earth with his hoofs. Disturbed by the noise
Bāli along with his wife Tārā came out of the palace,
and said to Dundubhi: “Look here, please, I am only
a King of the monkeys. Why should you, who are so
very strong smash my tower?” but, these soft words of
Bāli only kindled Dundubhi's anger all the more and his
challenges became the fiercer. Then did Bāli, wearing
the golden chain given by Indra, rush forth to engage
Dundubhi in mortal duel in which the former began
gaining more and more strength while the latter got wea-
ker and weaker. Dundubhi took to flight in the skies to
save his life. But, the moon dawned then and in the
moonlight Bāli and his brother Sugrīva followed Dun-
dubhi, who entered a terrible cave covered by something
like a forest of grass. After stationing Sugrīva at the
opening of the cave Bāli followed Dundubhi into the
cave. Sugrīva waited there one year for the return of
Bāli from the cave when one day he witnessed foaming
blood flow out of the mouth of the cave, and mistakenly
believing that Bāli was dead he closed the mouth of the
cave with a huge stone and returned home. But, Bāli,
who had by then killed Dundubhi kicked off the stone
[Page254-a+ 65]
and came out of the cave and followed Sugrīva in a
rage. From that day onwards Śugrīva lived at the Ṛṣya-
mūka mountain where Bāli had no admission. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Cantos 9, 11, 46).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Curse on Bāli due to the blood of Dundubhi.%} During
Bāli's duel with Dundubhi blood from the body of the
latter spurted out to the skies, and it also fell in the
hermitage of Mataṅga at Ṛṣyamūka where the sage
Mataṅga was performing tapas. Angered at this the sage
cursed him whoever he might be, who was responsible
for blood falling in his āśrama, with death by his head
getting broken if he mounted Ṛṣyamūka. Sugrīva took
shelter there because of this curse on Bāli. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Canto 11)
