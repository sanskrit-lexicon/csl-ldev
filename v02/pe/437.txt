ARIṢṬANEMI VI¦. A King. Realising the transient
<div n="lb"/>nature of worldly life, he gave up his kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>went to and did tapas at Mount Gandhamādana. Indra
<div n="lb"/>who was very much pleased at this sent a messenger
<div n="lb"/>with a vimāna (aeroplane) to conduct the King to
<div n="lb"/>Svarga (heaven). When he was told that there was in
<div n="lb"/>Svarga also the states of being high or low, and fall
<div n="lb"/>happened when the effect of good actions decreased,
<div n="lb"/>the King gave up his desire for Svarga and sent back
<div n="lb"/>Indra's messenger. Then Indra sent the King with a
[Page048-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>messenger to the Āśrama of Vālmīki so that he might
<div n="lb"/>gain spiritual knowledge. Vālmīki consoled the King
<div n="lb"/>with the advice that the telling, hearing and pondering
<div n="lb"/>over the story of the Rāmāyaṇa alone would be enough
<div n="lb"/>to get eternal salvation. (Yogavāsiṣṭham).
