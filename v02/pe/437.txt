ARIṢṬANEMI VI¦. A King. Realising the transient
nature of worldly life, he gave up his kingdom and
went to and did tapas at Mount Gandhamādana. Indra
who was very much pleased at this sent a messenger
with a vimāna (aeroplane) to conduct the King to
Svarga (heaven). When he was told that there was in
Svarga also the states of being high or low, and fall
happened when the effect of good actions decreased,
the King gave up his desire for Svarga and sent back
Indra's messenger. Then Indra sent the King with a
[Page048-b+ 65]
messenger to the Āśrama of Vālmīki so that he might
gain spiritual knowledge. Vālmīki consoled the King
with the advice that the telling, hearing and pondering
over the story of the Rāmāyaṇa alone would be enough
to get eternal salvation. (Yogavāsiṣṭham).
