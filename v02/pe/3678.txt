KṚTA¦. I. A King of Janaka's dynasty. He was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Vijaya and father of Śunaka. (Bhāgavata, 9th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha). Kṛta had seven beautiful daughters who,
<div n="lb"/>because of a sense of non-attachment and renunciation,
<div n="lb"/>forsook their father's home for the cremation ground
<div n="lb"/>even while they were mere children. They lay down
<div n="lb"/>there declaring that they had left their bodies as food
<div n="lb"/>for the birds; and birds and wild beasts ate up their
<div n="lb"/>beautiful bodies. Because of this life of renunciation,
<div n="lb"/>they attained salvation. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madana-
<div n="lb"/>mañjukālambaka, Taraṅga 2).
