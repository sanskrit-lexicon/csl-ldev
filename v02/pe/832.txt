BABHRUVĀHANA¦. A son of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} When the Pāṇḍavas were residing in Indra-
<div n="lb"/>prastha after marrying Pāñcālī, Nārada went to see
<div n="lb"/>them once. With a view to avoiding any quarrel bet-
<div n="lb"/>ween the Pāṇḍavas over the one wife they jointly possess-
<div n="lb"/>ed, Nārada suggested that each should take Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>for a year in turn and he who violated the arrange-
<div n="lb"/>ment should go to the forest for a year. Once Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>went to the house of Yudhiṣṭhira who was with Pāñcāli
<div n="lb"/>and for thus violating the arrangement Arjuna had to
<div n="lb"/>go to the forest for a year. During this exile while he
<div n="lb"/>was staying at Gaṅgādvāra he married the serpent girl,
<div n="lb"/>Ulūpi and got a son called Irāvān of her.
<div n="NI"/>After that he went to a country called Maṇalūr. At
<div n="lb"/>that time that country was being ruled by a king called
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada. Prabhañjana one of the forefathers of
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada had, by hard penance for a progeny, acquir-
<div n="lb"/>ed from Śiva a boon and each of his successors got a
<div n="lb"/>son each to maintain the line. But when it came to
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada to his surprise he got a girl instead of a son.
<div n="lb"/>But he got her up as a son and named her Citrāṅgada.
<div n="lb"/>It was when she was ready for marriage that Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>went there. The king received Arjuna with respect and
<div n="lb"/>after enquiring about his welfare requested him to marry
<div n="lb"/>his daughter. Arjuna married her and stayed there for
<div n="lb"/>three months. Leaving that place Arjuna went to
<div n="lb"/>Pañcatīrtha and there he gave salvation to the celestial
<div n="lb"/>maidens who were lying in the tīrthas as crocodiles.
<div n="lb"/>When he went back to Maṇalūr Citrāṅgadā had deli-
<div n="lb"/>vered a son whom he named Babhruvāhana. Promising
[Page097-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>them that he would take them later to Hastināpura, he
<div n="lb"/>left the place.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%His fate to kill his own father.%} It was by a ruse that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna made Bhīṣma fall. Arjuna put Śikhaṇḍī before
<div n="lb"/>his chariot and Bhīṣma refused to take arms against a
<div n="lb"/>eunuch and accepted defeat. But Gaṅgādevī witnessing
<div n="lb"/>the battle between Bhīṣma, her son, and Arjuna from
<div n="lb"/>above could not bear this foul play and so cursed that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna would die at the hands of his son. Ulūpi the
<div n="lb"/>serpent wife of Arjuna heard this curse and went to her
<div n="lb"/>father Kauravya who in turn went to Gaṅgā and begged
<div n="lb"/>for a relief from the curse. Gaṅgādevī then said that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna would be killed by Babhruvāhana but would be
<div n="lb"/>brought to life by Ulūpi by placing the Mṛtasañjīvanī
<div n="lb"/>stone on the dead man's breast.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The killing of Arjuna.%} The Mahābhārata battle was
<div n="lb"/>over. When Yudhiṣṭhira was performing the Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>yāga Arjuna conducted a victory march with the yāga
<div n="lb"/>horse. On his way he reached Maṇalūr. At once Ulūpi
<div n="lb"/>called Babhruvāhana and asked him to challenge Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>Babhruvāhana with his bow and arrows attacked Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and in the grim battle that followed Arjuna fell dead.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing this Citrāṅgadā came to the place of battle
<div n="lb"/>weeping and abused Ulūpi for persuading Babhruvāhana
<div n="lb"/>to kill his own father. Ulūpi immediately went to the
<div n="lb"/>serpent world and brought the Mṛtasañjīvanī stone and
<div n="lb"/>as she placed it on Arjuna's breast he came to life as if
<div n="lb"/>waking up from a sleep. When he saw Citrāṅgadā,
<div n="lb"/>Babhruvāhana and Ulūpī he smiled and asked them
<div n="lb"/>why they had all come there. Ulūpī then explained to
<div n="lb"/>him the story of the curse and extremely pleased over
<div n="lb"/>the end of the curse Arjuna took them all to Hastinā-
<div n="lb"/>pura. (Chapters 218 to 210 of Ādi Parva and Chapters
<div n="lb"/>79 to 82 of Aśvamedha Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%} (1) On reaching Hastināpura Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>gave Babhruvāhana as a present a chariot drawn by
<div n="lb"/>divine horses. (Śloka 6, Chapter 88, Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The different names given to him in the Purāṇas are
<div n="lb"/>as follows: Citrāṅgadāsuta, Maṇippūrpati, Dhanañjaya-
<div n="lb"/>suta and Maṇipureśvara.
