BABHRUVĀHANA¦. A son of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} When the Pāṇḍavas were residing in Indra-
prastha after marrying Pāñcālī, Nārada went to see
them once. With a view to avoiding any quarrel bet-
ween the Pāṇḍavas over the one wife they jointly possess-
ed, Nārada suggested that each should take Pāñcālī
for a year in turn and he who violated the arrange-
ment should go to the forest for a year. Once Arjuna
went to the house of Yudhiṣṭhira who was with Pāñcāli
and for thus violating the arrangement Arjuna had to
go to the forest for a year. During this exile while he
was staying at Gaṅgādvāra he married the serpent girl,
Ulūpi and got a son called Irāvān of her.
<div n="NI"/>After that he went to a country called Maṇalūr. At
that time that country was being ruled by a king called
Citrāṅgada. Prabhañjana one of the forefathers of
Citrāṅgada had, by hard penance for a progeny, acquir-
ed from Śiva a boon and each of his successors got a
son each to maintain the line. But when it came to
Citrāṅgada to his surprise he got a girl instead of a son.
But he got her up as a son and named her Citrāṅgada.
It was when she was ready for marriage that Arjuna
went there. The king received Arjuna with respect and
after enquiring about his welfare requested him to marry
his daughter. Arjuna married her and stayed there for
three months. Leaving that place Arjuna went to
Pañcatīrtha and there he gave salvation to the celestial
maidens who were lying in the tīrthas as crocodiles.
When he went back to Maṇalūr Citrāṅgadā had deli-
vered a son whom he named Babhruvāhana. Promising
[Page097-a+ 65]
them that he would take them later to Hastināpura, he
left the place.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%His fate to kill his own father.%} It was by a ruse that
Arjuna made Bhīṣma fall. Arjuna put Śikhaṇḍī before
his chariot and Bhīṣma refused to take arms against a
eunuch and accepted defeat. But Gaṅgādevī witnessing
the battle between Bhīṣma, her son, and Arjuna from
above could not bear this foul play and so cursed that
Arjuna would die at the hands of his son. Ulūpi the
serpent wife of Arjuna heard this curse and went to her
father Kauravya who in turn went to Gaṅgā and begged
for a relief from the curse. Gaṅgādevī then said that
Arjuna would be killed by Babhruvāhana but would be
brought to life by Ulūpi by placing the Mṛtasañjīvanī
stone on the dead man's breast.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The killing of Arjuna.%} The Mahābhārata battle was
over. When Yudhiṣṭhira was performing the Aśvamedha
yāga Arjuna conducted a victory march with the yāga
horse. On his way he reached Maṇalūr. At once Ulūpi
called Babhruvāhana and asked him to challenge Arjuna.
Babhruvāhana with his bow and arrows attacked Arjuna
and in the grim battle that followed Arjuna fell dead.
Seeing this Citrāṅgadā came to the place of battle
weeping and abused Ulūpi for persuading Babhruvāhana
to kill his own father. Ulūpi immediately went to the
serpent world and brought the Mṛtasañjīvanī stone and
as she placed it on Arjuna's breast he came to life as if
waking up from a sleep. When he saw Citrāṅgadā,
Babhruvāhana and Ulūpī he smiled and asked them
why they had all come there. Ulūpī then explained to
him the story of the curse and extremely pleased over
the end of the curse Arjuna took them all to Hastinā-
pura. (Chapters 218 to 210 of Ādi Parva and Chapters
79 to 82 of Aśvamedha Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%} (1) On reaching Hastināpura Śrī Kṛṣṇa
gave Babhruvāhana as a present a chariot drawn by
divine horses. (Śloka 6, Chapter 88, Aśvamedha
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The different names given to him in the Purāṇas are
as follows: Citrāṅgadāsuta, Maṇippūrpati, Dhanañjaya-
suta and Maṇipureśvara.
