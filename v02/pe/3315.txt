<div n="lb"/>became empty. Taking that opportunity the enemies
<div n="lb"/>attacked his country. There was no army for him to

<div n="lb"/>blew his hands and then an army sufficient to fight
<div n="lb"/>his enemies appeared before him and using that he
<div n="lb"/>defeated them. Because he arranged an army by
<div n="lb"/>Karadhamana (blowing of hands) he was given the
<div n="lb"/>name of Karandhamana also.
