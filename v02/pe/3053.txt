KAIKEYĪ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} One of the wives of Daśa-
ratha, who had three wives, Kausalyā, Kaikeyī and
Sumitrā. It is mentioned in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 70, Stanza 28 that Kaikeyī was
the sister of Yudhājit, the King of Kekaya. Kekaya
was seven days’ journey away from Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Getting boons.%} In days of old there was a battle
between the devas and the asuras and Daśaratha went
to the world of Devas, with Kaikeyī, in a chariot to
help Indra against the Asuras. The devas were in a
sorry plight due to the illusive and sorcerous mode of
fighting of Śambara the Asura and his men. Daśaratha
faced the Asuras in ten directions at the same time and
fought with them. In this fight his chariot had to be
turned to every direction and up and down so swiftly
that the bolt of the wheel slipped out and the wheel
was about to come off when Kaikeyī inserted her thumb
in the hole of the bolt and kept the chariot safe and
steady. The King was not aware of this bravery on the
part of his wife. At last when he came to know of this
he promised to give her two boons. The queen said
that she would ask for those two boons later as she
didn't want anything then. After this the King and
the queen returned to their country. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Sarga 9; Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Request for the boons and the forest life of Śrī Rāma.%} As
the celebration of anointing Śrī Rāma as the Heir
apparent in Ayodhyā was going on, the humpy
Mantharā approached Kaikeyī and advised her on the
ways of making her son Bharata King and sending Śrī
Rāma to forest. At first Kaikeyī refused to agree to
this, but at last she succumbed to the repeated advice
of Mantharā. Daśaratha came to see Kaikeyī who was
lying in grief. Making use of this opportunity Kaikeyī
requested for the granting of the two boons promised
earlier. One boon was that Bharata should be anointed
as heir apparent making use of the preparations made
for Śrī Rāma and the other boon was that Śrī Rāma
should live in forest, wearing bark of trees and matted
hair for fourteen years. When Daśaratha heard these
requests he became unconscious. But he granted her
wishes.
