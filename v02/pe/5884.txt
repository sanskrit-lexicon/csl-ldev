SĀDHU¦. An incarnation of Śiva. The Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa
contains the following story about it.
<div n="NI"/>When the Himālaya and Maināka mountains once
began a very intense tapas, the Devas and Ṛṣis fearing
great ruin to the world in case the mountains got salva-
tion, sought Śiva's protection and prayed for a solution
for the problem. So Śiva, in the guise of a brahmin
named Sādhu, went to the mountains, spoke to them
condemning Śiva and thus made them retract from their
devotion to Śiva.
