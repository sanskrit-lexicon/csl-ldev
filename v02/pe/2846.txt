JAMBŪ¦. A tree which stands on the southern side of
<div n="lb"/>the mount Mahāmeru. This tree bears fruits and
<div n="lb"/>flowers throughout the year irrespective of the seasons.
<div n="lb"/>This tree is watered by the Siddhacāraṇas. The
<div n="lb"/>branches of this tree reach the realm of heaven. The
<div n="lb"/>place in which this tree stands is known as Jambū-
<div n="lb"/>dvīpa. The ripe fruits as big as elephants fall down and
<div n="lb"/>are broken. The juice oozing from them flows as a big
<div n="lb"/>stream. This is called the river Jambū. It flows through
<div n="lb"/>the southern part of the country known as Ilāvṛtta.
<div n="lb"/>The goddess who lives on the bank of this big river is
<div n="lb"/>known as Jambvādinī. She is very fond of Jambū fruit.
<div n="lb"/>This goddess who loves everything in the world, is
<div n="lb"/>worshipped by the gods, nāgas (snakes), the hermits and
<div n="lb"/>sages, Rākṣasas (giants) and every body in the world
<div n="lb"/>with devotion. Even by the mere thinking of her she
<div n="lb"/>could be pleased. She destroys the sins and increases
<div n="lb"/>the purity of people. She cures all the diseases and
<div n="lb"/>gives people, health, wealth, long life, prosperity and
<div n="lb"/>happiness.
<div n="NI"/>The juice of the Jambū fruit when mixed with soil and
<div n="lb"/>acted upon by water, air and sun's rays, turns into a
<div n="lb"/>kind of gold called Jāmbūnada. The devas, Vidyā-
<div n="lb"/>dharas etc. use this gold to make ornaments for their
<div n="lb"/>women. This gold is superior to other kinds of gold.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
