JAMBŪ¦. A tree which stands on the southern side of
the mount Mahāmeru. This tree bears fruits and
flowers throughout the year irrespective of the seasons.
This tree is watered by the Siddhacāraṇas. The
branches of this tree reach the realm of heaven. The
place in which this tree stands is known as Jambū-
dvīpa. The ripe fruits as big as elephants fall down and
are broken. The juice oozing from them flows as a big
stream. This is called the river Jambū. It flows through
the southern part of the country known as Ilāvṛtta.
The goddess who lives on the bank of this big river is
known as Jambvādinī. She is very fond of Jambū fruit.
This goddess who loves everything in the world, is
worshipped by the gods, nāgas (snakes), the hermits and
sages, Rākṣasas (giants) and every body in the world
with devotion. Even by the mere thinking of her she
could be pleased. She destroys the sins and increases
the purity of people. She cures all the diseases and
gives people, health, wealth, long life, prosperity and
happiness.
<div n="NI"/>The juice of the Jambū fruit when mixed with soil and
acted upon by water, air and sun's rays, turns into a
kind of gold called Jāmbūnada. The devas, Vidyā-
dharas etc. use this gold to make ornaments for their
women. This gold is superior to other kinds of gold.
(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
