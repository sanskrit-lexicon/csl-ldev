MAṄKI II¦. A sage who lived in Tretāyuga. He was
the son of Kauṣītakibrāhmaṇa and was a Vaiṣṇavite of
great virtue. This sage had two wives named Surūpā
and Virūpā. Both had no sons and as per the advice of
his guru he went to Sabarmatītaṭa and did penance
there. After several years of rigorous austerities he got
very many children. The place where Maṅkimaharṣi
sat and did penance was known later as Maṅkitīrtha.
It is also called Saptasārasvata. In Dvāparayuga the
Pāṇḍavas visited the place and gave it the name Sapta-
dhāra also. (Uttara Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
