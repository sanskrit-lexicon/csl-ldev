UŚĪNARA I¦. A famous king of the Candravaṃśa (Lunar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty).
[Page813-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order:-Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa-Yayāti-Anudruhyu-Sabhānara-Kālanara-Sṛñ-
<div n="lb"/>jaya-Uśīnara. Uśīnara was the father of Śibi and Vena.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The reason for the curse of the eight Vasus.%} Once the
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭavasus (Vasus eight in number) came to the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of Vasiṣṭha, with their wives. The wife of Dyau, one
<div n="lb"/>of the Aṣṭavasus, saw the cow ‘Nandinī’ in the hermit-
<div n="lb"/>age. She and the daughter of Uśīnara were intimate
<div n="lb"/>friends. She wanted to get Nandinī, so that she
<div n="lb"/>might give it as a present to the daughter of Uṣīnara.
<div n="lb"/>According to her wish the Aṣṭavasus caught hold of
<div n="lb"/>the cow and took her home. At that time Vasiṣṭha had
<div n="lb"/>been away. When he returned, he knew about the
<div n="lb"/>theft of the cow and cursed the Aṣṭavasus to take birth
<div n="lb"/>in the wombs of women on earth. It was according to
<div n="lb"/>this curse that the Aṣṭavasus took birth in Gaṅgādevī
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Śantanu. See under Bhīṣma. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 2).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indra testing Uśīnara.%} Uśīnara was a just and liberal-
<div n="lb"/>minded King. Indra decided to test the King regard-
<div n="lb"/>ing his liberality. He got Agnideva (fire-god) for his
<div n="lb"/>help. Indra took the form of a Kite and Agni that of
<div n="lb"/>a dove. Both flew down to Uśīnara as if the Kite was
<div n="lb"/>chasing the dove. Uśīnara agreed to protect the dove.
<div n="lb"/>The Kite argued with the King that it was not meet
<div n="lb"/>and right on his part to rob him of his lawful food.
<div n="lb"/>The King agreed to give any other kind of flesh to the
<div n="lb"/>Kite. But the Kite would have none of them. Finally
<div n="lb"/>the Kite agreed to accept the flesh of the King instead,
<div n="lb"/>equal to the weight of the dove. The King cut more
<div n="lb"/>and more flesh from his body, but it could not weigh
<div n="lb"/>equal to the dove. At last the King himself got into
<div n="lb"/>the balance. Then the gods had pity on the King and
<div n="lb"/>the Kite and the dove appeared in their real form and
<div n="lb"/>blessed the King and then they returned to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 131). In Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>a story like this occurs about King Śibi also.
