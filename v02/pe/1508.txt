CATURUPĀYAM¦. The four means used by Kings in
olden times to achieve their objects are called Caturu-
pāyam. Sāma, dāna, bheda and daṇḍa are the Catur-
upāyas (four tactics). There are three other upāyas
also, almost equally important as the first four, and the
seven upāyas are collectively called Saptopāyas. There
are also yet other upāyas, but they are not important
enough to merit special mention.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Sāma.%} It is the best means to attract and convert
others to one's side. It consists in winning people with
sweet words and looks. People who are friendly by
temperament and straightforward may be brought
round by sāma. Sāma is employed in dealing with sons,
brothers and other relatives.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Dāna.%} There are five kinds or varieties of dāna
(gift) viz. prītidāna, dravyadāna, svayaṃgrāha, deya
and pratimokṣa. If a person gets help from another
and acknowledges help by reward that reward is
called prītidāna. The miser and the poor should be
brought round by prītidāna. Military captains, heroes
and citizens should be won over by this dāna. Those
who fall at feet should be honoured by dāna.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bheda.%} Bhedopāya is of three kinds: to destroy or
end the friendship subsisting between people, to create
dissension and to make the parties quarrel with each
other. He who is falsely praised, he who does not desire
wealth or welfare, he who has been invited to come and
then insulted, traitor to king, he who has been exorbi-
tantly taxed, the angry one, the honourable one, the
insulted, the unreasonably forsaken one, he who har-
bours hatred in his mind, the pacified one, one whose
wealth and wife have been taken away or stolen, he
who has not been respected though deserving of respect—
if such people are in one's opposite camp, suspicion
should be raked up among them and thus division crea-
ted in their ranks. If subordinate chieftains, and forest
tribes commit offences they should be brought round
by the use of sāma and bheda upāyas.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Daṇḍa.%} Daṇḍopāya is of three kinds, viz, killing,
denuding of wealth, and inflicting pain on the body or
torture. Daṇḍa has two other forms, prakāśa (open)
and aprakāśa (secret). Those who have become objects
of hatred to all people should be subjected to prakāśa-
daṇḍa. People, whose killing the world will detest,
should not be killed openly, but only secretly. Enemies
should be killed with weapons etc. Brahmins should not
be killed. Friends and allies should not be subjected
to daṇḍa; friends, who are made objects of daṇḍa will
wither away like worm-eaten trees. The King, who
possesses the three powers (of wealth, army and people's
support) and is fully conscious of the time and environ-
mental factors should annihilate enemies by the instru-
ment of daṇḍa. Evil people should be defeated by
daṇḍa itself.
<div n="NI"/>The upāya māyā consists in practising deception by
magic or other yogic powers. The powers can be
acquired by the worship of the idols of certain Devatās.
People who employ go about at night in various dis-
guises. They disguise themselves as beautiful women or
even as animals. They also deceive people by creating
illusions of clouds, fire or lightning. For instance, Bhīma
killed Kīcaka by going to him in the guise of a woman.
[Page180-a+ 65]
Not to dissuade people who indulge in unjustifiable
grief, war etc. is the principal aim of the upāya called
upekṣā. Hiḍimbī gave up his brother Hidimba by
practising Upekṣā. Next is the Indrajālopāya (magic).
For example, to create illusions of clouds, darkness, rain,
fire, and other magic in order to instil fear among
troops of the enemy etc. To scare the enemy is the aim
of Indrajāla. (For details of Caturupāyas see Kaṇika).
