KALKI¦. The tenth avatāra (incarnation) of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. The ten avatāras are called Daśāvatāras.
<div n="lb"/>Kalki is the last of them. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 16
<div n="lb"/>says as follows about the incarnation of Kalki:—
<div n="NI"/>Towards the end of Kaliyuga, all people will lose their
<div n="lb"/>faith in God and become irreligious. They will accept
<div n="lb"/>presents from the wicked. At that time, there will be
<div n="lb"/>intermixture of castes. People will become thieves and
<div n="lb"/>evil doers. Fifteen divisions of the Veda Vājasaneya
<div n="lb"/>alone will become the authoritative document. People,
<div n="lb"/>wearing the garb of righteousness, will indulge in
<div n="lb"/>unrighteousness. Mlecchas (lowest class of people)
<div n="lb"/>assuming the form of Kings will begin feeding upon
<div n="lb"/>human beings. At that time Lord Viṣṇu will incarnate
<div n="lb"/>as Kalki, the son of Viṣṇuyaśas and the priest of
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya and exterminate all mlecchas. He will
<div n="lb"/>restore people to cāturvarṇya and the four āśramas and
<div n="lb"/>maintain proper standards of conduct. Afterwards the
<div n="lb"/>Lord will renounce the form of Kalki and ascend
<div n="lb"/>Heaven. Then Kṛtayuga will begin again.
<div n="NI"/>Chapter 190 of Bhāṣā Bhārata supports almost all the
<div n="lb"/>above statements. In the light of them, we can gather cer-
<div n="lb"/>tain features of Kalki's incarnation when Kaliyuga reaches
<div n="lb"/>its zenith. Mahāviṣṇu will be born as a Brāhmaṇa with
<div n="lb"/>the name Viṣṇuyaśas, in the village called Śāmbhala.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇuyaśaṣ will become famous under the name Kalki.
<div n="lb"/>He will be the priest of Yājñavalkya. He will create arms
<div n="lb"/>and soldiers by his will itself and destroy the wicked.
<div n="lb"/>With that Kṛtayuga will commence.
<div n="NI"/>There is difference of opinion as to whether Kalki's
<div n="lb"/>incarnation has passed or is yet to come. But in the
<div n="lb"/>light of the statements in the Purāṇas, Kalki has not
<div n="lb"/>yet come. Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, says that
<div n="lb"/>Kaliyuga extends over a period of 4, 32, 000 years.
<div n="lb"/>It is now only a little over 5,000 years since it began.
<div n="lb"/>Still, more than 4, 26, 900 years have to pass before
<div n="lb"/>the end of Kaliyuga. Therefore lakhs of years have
<div n="lb"/>still to pass before the incarnation of Kalki.
