ŚAIVACĀPA¦. Śiva's bow. It was made by Viśvakarmā.
<div n="lb"/>He made a Vaiṣṇavacāpa and a Śaivacāpa for the pur-
<div n="lb"/>pose of a battle which was fought once between Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva. (See the 7th sub para, 7th para under the word
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu).
<div n="NI"/>Long ago when Śiva set out to break up Dakṣayāga, he
<div n="lb"/>was armed with this bow. After defeating the enemy
<div n="lb"/>and breaking up the yāga, Śiva cooled down and pre-
<div n="lb"/>sented the bow to his devotee, the king of Videha. The
<div n="lb"/>king took the bow to his palace, kept it in his armoury
<div n="lb"/>and used to offer due worship to it. His descendants
<div n="lb"/>also continued to worship it. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bāla Kāṇḍa).
