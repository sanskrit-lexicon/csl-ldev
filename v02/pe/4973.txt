PAÑCAMAHĀYAJÑA¦. For a Gṛhasthāśramī (house-
<div n="lb"/>holder) the following five apparatuses are unavoidable:
<div n="lb"/>A sifter, a grinding stone, a broom, a wooden mortar
<div n="lb"/>and a water-pot. It is believed that a sin is committed
<div n="lb"/>when each of these is used and to remove the sins thus
<div n="lb"/>committed the ancient sages have prescribed five
<div n="lb"/>yajñas and these five yajñas are called the Pañcamahā-
<div n="lb"/>yajñas. They are the Brahmayajña, Pitṛyajña,
<div n="lb"/>Devayajña, Bhūtayajña and the Mānuṣayajña.
<div n="lb"/>Reciting of Vedas is Brahmayajña. Pleasing the
<div n="lb"/>manes by offering rice or libations of water is called
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛyajña. Giving offerings to the demi-gods in the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial fire is called Devayajña and religious
<div n="lb"/>offerings of rice to the crows is called Bhūtayajña.
<div n="lb"/>Giving food for the guests is Mānuṣayajña. One who
<div n="lb"/>does not do the Pañcamahāyajñas is no better than dead.
<div n="lb"/>Some scholars have classified the Pañcamahāyajñas
<div n="lb"/>as Huta, Prahuta, Brāhmyahuta, Prāśita and Ahuta.
<Poem>Japo huto huto homaḥ
<div n="lb"/>Prahuto bhautiko baliḥ //
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmyaṃ hutaṃ dvijāgnyarccā
<div n="lb"/>Prāsitam pitṛtarpaṇam. //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Ahuta is Brahmayajña, huta is devayajña, prahuta is
<div n="lb"/>bhūtayajña, brāhmyahuta is mānuṣikayajña and
<div n="lb"/>prāśita is pitṛyajña. Even if at times one finds it not
<div n="lb"/>possible to do mānuṣikayajña one must perform daily
<div n="lb"/>brahmayajña and daivayajña. The offerings given to
<div n="lb"/>gods in the sacrificial fire go to the Sun. The Sun
<div n="lb"/>sends rains to the earth which in turn make the plants
<div n="lb"/>flourish. Vedas say that thus living beings increase. Just
<div n="lb"/>as all animals and objects depend on life-breath for
<div n="lb"/>living, a Brahmacārī, a Vānaprastha and a Sannyāsī
<div n="lb"/>depend upon a gṛhastha for sustenance. Therefore, the
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhasthāśrama is the best of all āśramas. (Chapter 3,
<div n="lb"/>Manūsmṛti).
