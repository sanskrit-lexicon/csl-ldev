DAKṢIṆAPĀÑCĀLA¦. A place famous in the Purāṇas.
<div n="lb"/>This place lies to the south of the Ganges up to the river
<div n="lb"/>Caṃpat. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 14, Stanza 27, that the King of this country
<div n="lb"/>fled to the south fearing Jarāsandha. Pāñcāla lies to the
<div n="lb"/>south and north of the Ganges. But the country was
<div n="lb"/>divided into two when Droṇa defeated Drupada the
<div n="lb"/>King of Pāñcāla, and took away from him the part of the
<div n="lb"/>country north of the Ganges. After that, the part taken
<div n="lb"/>by Droṇa was called Uttarapāñcāla and the part south
<div n="lb"/>of the Ganges was called Dakṣiṇapāñcāla. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 137).
