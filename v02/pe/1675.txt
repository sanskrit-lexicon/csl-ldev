DAKṢIṆAPĀÑCĀLA¦. A place famous in the Purāṇas.
This place lies to the south of the Ganges up to the river
Caṃpat. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 14, Stanza 27, that the King of this country
fled to the south fearing Jarāsandha. Pāñcāla lies to the
south and north of the Ganges. But the country was
divided into two when Droṇa defeated Drupada the
King of Pāñcāla, and took away from him the part of the
country north of the Ganges. After that, the part taken
by Droṇa was called Uttarapāñcāla and the part south
of the Ganges was called Dakṣiṇapāñcāla. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 137).
