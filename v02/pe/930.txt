BALLĀLA¦. Son of a Vaiśya named Kalyāṇa. From
childhood Ballāla was an ardent devotee of Gaṇapati.
When he was a child he used to gather pebbles and
make a heap and then worship it, imagining it to be
Gaṇeśa (Gaṇapati).
<div n="NI"/>His parents did not like this. They tried their best to
dissuade him from this habit. Once they tied him to
a tree and gave him severe cuts. But their attempts
were futile. One day an image of Gaṇapati arose in
the place where the child used to worship. (Gaṇeśa
Purāṇa 1:2).
