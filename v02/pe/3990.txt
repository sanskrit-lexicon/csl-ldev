LIKHITA I¦. An ancient sage. The King of that land
<div n="lb"/>cut off his hands on a charge of theft. But they grew
<div n="lb"/>into their original form by the power of the penance of
<div n="lb"/>his brother, (Chapter 23, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>It was a time when the celebrated King Sudyumna was
<div n="lb"/>ruling over the country. On the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Bāhudā in that country there lived two sages, Śaṅkha
<div n="lb"/>and Likhita, in two separate hermitages of their own.
<div n="lb"/>Once Likhita went to the āśrama of his elder brother
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkha and finding none but feeling hungry took some
<div n="lb"/>vegetables from there and started eating them. While
<div n="lb"/>he was eating his brother walked in and he deemed
<div n="lb"/>the action of his brother taking the vegetables without
<div n="lb"/>his permission as an act of theft. Cutting the hands of
<div n="lb"/>the culprit was the punishment accorded by the King
<div n="lb"/>at that time to the offender. Śaṅkha sent Likhita to the
<div n="lb"/>King. The King received the sage respectfully and gave
<div n="lb"/>him a seat. The sage then told him all that had happen-
<div n="lb"/>ed and then Sudyumna ordered the hands of Likhita to
<div n="lb"/>be cut off. Blood was oozing from his hands when
<div n="lb"/>Likhita went and bowed before his brother. The brother
<div n="lb"/>congratulated him on his accepting the punishment for
<div n="lb"/>his crime and asked Likhita to go and take a dip in the
<div n="lb"/>Bāhudā river. Likhita bathed in that holy river and
<div n="lb"/>then he found both the hands growing like lotus-buds
<div n="lb"/>from his body. He rushed to his brother and showed
<div n="lb"/>him the hands and then Śaṅkha said that it was due to
<div n="lb"/>the power of his penance that Likhita got his hands.
<div n="lb"/>Then Likhita asked his brother why he did not purify
<div n="lb"/>him by his power before. Śaṅkha replied that the power
<div n="lb"/>of punishing was vested in the King and the King
[Page453-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Sudyumna had become great by executing the law
<div n="lb"/>correctly.
