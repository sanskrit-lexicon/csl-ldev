ALAMBUṢĀ¦. A celestial woman born to Kaśyapa by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Pradhā.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Begins from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order: Brahmā-Kaśyapa-Alambuṣā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How she enticed the hermit Dadhīca.%} In days of yore
<div n="lb"/>there was an ascetic named Dadhīca. He began doing
<div n="lb"/>tapas on the bank of the river Sarasvatī. Indra was in
<div n="lb"/>consternation. Indra sent this celestial maid Alambuṣā
<div n="lb"/>to entice the hermit. When the ascetic got down to the
<div n="lb"/>river, Alambuṣā approached him with enticing actions
<div n="lb"/>and expressions. When the hermit saw her he became
<div n="lb"/>passionate and he had seminal flow. The sperm fell
<div n="lb"/>into the river. The river became pregnant and delivered
<div n="lb"/>a child in due course. He was called Sārasvata.
<div n="NI"/>Alambuṣā brought the child before Dadhīca, who blessed
<div n="lb"/>the child and said that there would be a drought in the
<div n="lb"/>country continuously for twelve years and that at that
<div n="lb"/>juncture Sārasvata would recite passages from the
<div n="lb"/>Scripture to the Brahmins who had forgotten them. The
<div n="lb"/>much pleased Sarasvatī and Sārasvata went back.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Indra lost his Vajrāyudha (weapon of
<div n="lb"/>thunderbolt) somewhere. The Asuras (enemies of
<div n="lb"/>Gods) made an onslaught on the gods and their realm.
<div n="lb"/>Indra knew that with a weapon made by the bone of
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīca the Asuras could be destroyed. Indra asked the
<div n="lb"/>Gods to bring the bone. They came down to the earth
<div n="lb"/>and requested Dadhīca to give them a bone. Dadhīca
<div n="lb"/>giving his bone died and attained heaven. With his
<div n="lb"/>bones Indra made a good deal of weapons such as the
<div n="lb"/>Vajrāyudha, wheel weapons, maces and sticks and with
<div n="lb"/>them Indra slew all the Daityas (Asuras).
<div n="NI"/>After this there was a great famine in the country. As
<div n="lb"/>there was no rain, crops failed and lands became dry and
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmins left the country. Sārasvata alone remained
<div n="lb"/>with his mother. After twelve years the famine and
<div n="lb"/>starvation came to an end. By then the Brahmins had
<div n="lb"/>forgotten the hymns and mantras of the Vedas. They
<div n="lb"/>approached the boy Sārasvata and renewed their me-
<div n="lb"/>mory. (Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 51).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Punarjanma (Rebirth).%} Long ago Indra went to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. There was one Vasu called Vidhūma also with
<div n="lb"/>Indra. When these two were standing near Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Alambuṣā also came there to pay homage to Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>The garments she had on were displaced by wind.
<div n="lb"/>Vidhūma saw the dazzling beauty of her body and was
<div n="lb"/>overpowered by libido. Alambuṣā who understood
<div n="lb"/>this, was filled with passion for him. Brahmā who saw
<div n="lb"/>the changes in them looked at Indra with displeasure.
<div n="lb"/>Indra knowing the mind of Brahmā cursed them: “Both
<div n="lb"/>of you who have lost meekness shall become human be-
[Page025-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ings and then your desire will be fulfilled”. Owing to
<div n="lb"/>the curse Vidhūma was born as Sahasrānīka, the illus-
<div n="lb"/>trious King of Candra vaṃśa (Lunar dynasty) and
<div n="lb"/>Alambuṣā took birth as Mṛgāvatī, the daughter of King
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarmā and his wife Kalāvatī. (Kathāsaritsāgara,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāmukhalambaka, Taraṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The curse of Tilottamā.%} Sahasrānīka the incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Vidhūma and Mṛgāvatī the incarnation of Alambuṣā
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with each other on the earth also. Before
<div n="lb"/>the wedding took place Devendra once invited Sahasrā-
<div n="lb"/>nīka to heaven. He lived there for a time as the guest
<div n="lb"/>of the Gods. After having defeated the Asuras it was
<div n="lb"/>time for him to return. Indra sent Tilottamā to keep
<div n="lb"/>company. The charioteer was driving. Sahasrānīka
<div n="lb"/>immersed in the thought of Mṛgāvatī was sitting silent.
<div n="lb"/>Tilottamā said something which the King did not hear.
<div n="lb"/>Tilottamā cursed him that he would be separated for
<div n="lb"/>fourteen years from the object about which he was
<div n="lb"/>thinking. He was not even aware of the curse.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The period of separation.%} The King returned to
<div n="lb"/>Kauśāmbi his capital city. Without much delay the
<div n="lb"/>wedding ceremony also was conducted. She became
<div n="lb"/>pregnant. One day she told her lover-husband that she
<div n="lb"/>had a desire to dip in a blood pond. The King made a
<div n="lb"/>pond and filled it with a solution of Lākṣā (wax, when
<div n="lb"/>dissolved in water, the water will look like blood) and
<div n="lb"/>such other substances. Mṛgāvatī was dipping and splash-
<div n="lb"/>ing in it when an eagle taking her to be a piece of flesh
<div n="lb"/>took her away. At the loss of his wife Sahasrānīka lost
<div n="lb"/>his senses and fell down unconscious. Immediately
<div n="lb"/>Mātali, Indra's charioteer, came down from the realm of
<div n="lb"/>Gods and brought the King back to consciousness, and
<div n="lb"/>then informing him of the curse of Tilottamā he returned.
<div n="lb"/>Without paying any heed to the consolatory words of
<div n="lb"/>his ministers or other inmates of the palace the King
<div n="lb"/>went on lamenting and moaning, “ha, my love Mṛgā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī! Where are you now?” and waited for the end of
<div n="lb"/>the period of the curse, execrating Tilottamā. Casting
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgāvatī on the Mountain of the Rising Sun the great
<div n="lb"/>bird flew away. The horror-stricken queen, thinking of
<div n="lb"/>her present condition cried aloud. A very large mountain
<div n="lb"/>snake began to draw near to swallow her. A divine
<div n="lb"/>person saved her from that situation and vanished. The
<div n="lb"/>unprotected Mṛgāvatī decided to commit suicide. It
<div n="lb"/>was a forest which abounded in lions, tigers, bears and
<div n="lb"/>such other ferocious animals. But none of them came
<div n="lb"/>near her; over and above the exertion of carrying, she
<div n="lb"/>had to bear the difficulties of her forlorn condition, and
<div n="lb"/>she grew weary and worn and became unconscious.
<div n="lb"/>Then a hermit boy came there and questioned her who
<div n="lb"/>was now lean and ill-dressed, about her condition and
<div n="lb"/>consoling her guided her to the hermitage of the great
<div n="lb"/>hermit Jamadagni. When she saw the hermit who was
<div n="lb"/>as radiant as the Sun, she bowed low before him. “My
<div n="lb"/>daughter! Don't fear. You will get a heroic son here who
<div n="lb"/>will continue your family. You will be reunited to your
<div n="lb"/>husband.” Said the great and noble hermit, who could
<div n="lb"/>foresee the future. Somewhat pacified Mṛgāvatī lived
<div n="lb"/>in that hermitage waiting for reunion with her husband.
<div n="lb"/>After some days she gave birth to a son who had all the
<div n="lb"/>symptoms of greatness. At the birth of the child Mṛgā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī heard an unknown voice saying, “This boy would
<div n="lb"/>become the great and renowned King Udayana. His son
<div n="lb"/>would get the leadership of the Vidyādharas (the musi-
<div n="lb"/>cians of the Gods)”. At this the queen was immensely
[Page025-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>pleased. The boy Udayana grew up in the hermitage,
<div n="lb"/>an incarnation of all good qualities. The hermit to whom
<div n="lb"/>the past, the present and the future were not obscure,
<div n="lb"/>performed the necessary rites and rituals becoming a
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya boy (Ruling caste) and taught him everything
<div n="lb"/>including the Dhanurveda (the Science of Archery).
<div n="lb"/>As a token of her intense love for the son, she put a bangle
<div n="lb"/>with the name of Sahasrānīka inscribed on the arm of
<div n="lb"/>Udayana. One day when Udayana was tramping the
<div n="lb"/>forest, he saw a snake-charmer catching a snake. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>the beauty of the snake he asked the snake-charmer to let
<div n="lb"/>the snake free. But the snake-charmer replied, “Oh
<div n="lb"/>Prince, this is my daily bread. I earn my livelihood by
<div n="lb"/>exhibiting snakes. My previous snake was dead and it
<div n="lb"/>was with the help of a good deal of herbs and spells and
<div n="lb"/>incantations that I caught this one”.
<div n="NI"/>When he heard this Udayana felt pity for him and gave
<div n="lb"/>the bangle to the snake-charmer and let the snake free.
<div n="lb"/>When the snake-charmer had gone with the bangle,
<div n="lb"/>the snake beaming with joy said to Udayana: “I am
<div n="lb"/>Vasunemi, the elder brother of Vāsuki. I am grateful to
<div n="lb"/>you for giving me freedom. I give you this lute producing
<div n="lb"/>exquisite notes of music, betels and some tricks to pre-
<div n="lb"/>pare never fading garlands and paste to make marks on
<div n="lb"/>the forehead. Receive them as my presents”. Udayana
<div n="lb"/>accepted the presents with gladness and returned more
<div n="lb"/>luminous than before to the hermitage of Jamadagni.
<div n="lb"/>The snake-charmer took the bangle, given by Udayana
<div n="lb"/>to the bazar for sale. The police caught him and took
<div n="lb"/>him before the King, because they saw the name of the
<div n="lb"/>King inscribed on the bangle. The King asked him how
<div n="lb"/>he got the bangle and the snake-charmer told the King
<div n="lb"/>the story from the catching of the snake till he got the
<div n="lb"/>bangle. “This is the bangle that I put on the arm of my
<div n="lb"/>wife. The boy who gave this bangle to this snake-charmer
<div n="lb"/>must be my son.” The King was thinking with sadness,
<div n="lb"/>when the King heard a voice from above say, “O King!
<div n="lb"/>the period of the curse is over. Your wife and son are
<div n="lb"/>in the Mountain of the Rising Sun”. At these words the
<div n="lb"/>King felt extreme joy. Somehow or other he spent the
<div n="lb"/>rest of the day. Early the next morning the King follow-
<div n="lb"/>ed by his army, went to the Mountain of the Rising Sun
<div n="lb"/>to bring back his wife and son. They took the snake-
<div n="lb"/>charmer to show them the way.
<div n="NI"/>In due course the King and his train reached the holy
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of the eminent hermit Jamadagni. The place
<div n="lb"/>was always vibrant with sounds of the repeating and reci-
<div n="lb"/>tation of the Holy scriptures and covered with smoke
<div n="lb"/>mingled with the fragrance of burning herbs and other
<div n="lb"/>oblations burned in the sacrificial fire. The various wild
<div n="lb"/>animals which are born enemies of each other got on
<div n="lb"/>amicably there. The hermit who was an incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>the higher aspirations greeted the King who was the
<div n="lb"/>protector of the ascetics, with the hospitality becoming
<div n="lb"/>his status. The King who saw Mṛgāvatī with their son
<div n="lb"/>was overcome with gladness. Their reunion caused a
<div n="lb"/>shower of Ambrosia (Amṛta). The King stood before
<div n="lb"/>the hermit with folded arms and bowed head for per-
<div n="lb"/>mission to depart. To the King the hermit Jamadagni
<div n="lb"/>said: “Oh, King, you are welcome to this hermitage.
<div n="lb"/>To those such as you who are of the ‘Rajoguṇapradhāna’
<div n="lb"/>caste (Ruling race) the peaceful atmosphere of our
<div n="lb"/>hermitage may not be appealing to the heart. But a holy
<div n="lb"/>hermitage is more respectable than the palace of an
<div n="lb"/>Emperor. There is no place for unhappiness here. You
[Page026-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>might have known that the reason for your separation
<div n="lb"/>is a curse. When you were returning from heaven with
<div n="lb"/>Tilottamā, you were so much engrossed in the thought of
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgāvatī that you did not pay any heed to the conver-
<div n="lb"/>sation of Tilottamā. She was displeased with your be-
<div n="lb"/>haviour and cursed you. In future, if ever you happen to
<div n="lb"/>get into a position which will cause you mental trouble
<div n="lb"/>you can be assured of the presence of this Jamadagni.”
<div n="lb"/>The King said, “I am extremely grateful to your Emi-
<div n="lb"/>nence for this great boon. I am fully aware of the fact
<div n="lb"/>that the presence of the holy hermits who have under
<div n="lb"/>their control the eightfold prosperities, is always a
<div n="lb"/>harbinger of peace and prosperity. I am very sorry to
<div n="lb"/>say that the exigency of my presence at the capital due to
<div n="lb"/>the pressure of work in connection with the ruling of the
<div n="lb"/>country compels me to cut short my visit to this holy
<div n="lb"/>hermitage. I shall be looking forward with pleasure to
<div n="lb"/>occasions which will enable me to pay visits to this Holy
<div n="lb"/>abode.”
<div n="NI"/>Much pleased at the speech of the King the hermit said
<div n="lb"/>to Mṛgāvatī: “My daughter! Not only myself, but all
<div n="lb"/>the inmates of this hermitage are highly pleased at
<div n="lb"/>having got you in our midst for so long. We are sorry to
<div n="lb"/>part from you. Now look! the animals of the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>are standing round you and shedding tears. Still we are
<div n="lb"/>consoled at your reunion with your husband. Naturally
<div n="lb"/>you are of a very good character and your life in this
<div n="lb"/>hermitage has given you a nice training and so there is no
<div n="lb"/>need for any more advice from me at this time.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying this he drew Udayana to his side, kissed him on
<div n="lb"/>his head and said to the King again: “This son is a deco-
<div n="lb"/>ration to your dynasty. This handsome boy has been
<div n="lb"/>taught everything becoming a royal prince. Let him be a
<div n="lb"/>costly gem to you”.
<div n="NI"/>Thus blessing the boy the hermit led him to the King.
<div n="lb"/>The joy at her reunion with husband, her shyness at
<div n="lb"/>being near him, her sorrow at having to depart from the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage and the surging feeling in her mind—all
<div n="lb"/>these made her dumb and so being unable to say any-
<div n="lb"/>thing she expressed her love and regard for the hermit
<div n="lb"/>whom she loved as her father, by some motions of her
<div n="lb"/>body and took leave of him with her son. The blessed
<div n="lb"/>King and his train, looking at the men, beasts and birds
<div n="lb"/>which accompanied them for a while, took leave of them
<div n="lb"/>and proceeded to the capital city. On reaching there
<div n="lb"/>the King anointed his son Udayana as King. Sahasrā-
<div n="lb"/>nika then went to the Himālayas to practise ascesis with
<div n="lb"/>his wife. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 2).
<div n="NI"/>(b) {%Enticing Tṛnabindu.%} A story is seen in the Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata of how Alambuṣā enticed the King Tṛṇabindu. He
<div n="lb"/>married Alambuṣā and a daughter named Iḍaviḍā
<div n="lb"/>(Ilabilā) was born to them. This Ilabilā was married
<div n="lb"/>to Viśravas, to whom a son named Kubera (the Lord of
<div n="lb"/>wealth) was born By Alambuṣā Tṛṇabindu had three
<div n="lb"/>sons called Viśāla, Śūnyabandhu and Dhūmraketu.

<div n="lb"/>was honoured by Alambuṣā (as husband). Iḍaviḍā
<div n="lb"/>their daughter was given in marriage to Visravas and
<div n="lb"/>to them was born Dhanada (Kubera). His father
<div n="lb"/>who was a great hermit taught him everything required.
<div n="lb"/>Three sons Viśāla, Śunyabandhu and Dhūmraketu,
<div n="lb"/>were born to them. Viśāla who was the founder of the
<div n="lb"/>Dynasty, built a city called Vaiśāli.” (Bhāgavatam,
<div n="lb"/>Navama Skandham, Chapter 2, Stanzas 31-33).
<div n="NI"/>Alambuṣā took part in the birthday celebration of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna.
