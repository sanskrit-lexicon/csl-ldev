SULABHĀ¦. A female ascetic (Sannyāsinī). She acquired
several powers (Siddhis) by tapas. She had the power
of giving up her body and receiving new bodies. Once
she went to Mithilā and held a learned discussion with
King Janaka. She went to Mithilā as a beggar woman.
By her yogic powers she entered the mind of Janaka.
She and Janaka were thus in the same body when they
carried on the discussion. After remaining in Janaka's
body for a day, she left the palace. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 320).
