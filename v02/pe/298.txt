AṄGAKARMA¦. Actions on the stage are of two kinds.
One is to express by the major organs of the body. The
other is to express by the minor organs of the body. Head
etc. are major organs and eyebrow etc. are minor
organs. Actions expressed by major organs are called
Aṅgakarma and those by minor organs are called Prat-
yaṅga Karma. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 341).
