YĀTUDHĀNĪ¦. A Rākṣasī who was born from the sacrifi-
cial fire when King Vṛṣādarbhi performed a yāga. As
directed by the king, she proceeded to the forest to des-
troy the Saptarṣis. She remained there as the owner of
the tank in which the sages used to take bath. Seeing
her standing alone there, they enquired who she was.
She answered that she was guarding the tank. She allow-
ed them to enter into the tank after each of them explain-
ed the meaning of his name. Accordingly, the sages
Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, Viśvāmitra, Gautama and
Bharadvāja explained the meaning of their names be-
fore getting down into the tank. At last when sage
Śunassakha's turn came, he said that he was not pre-
pared to explain in detail, the meaning of his name and
that she should be satisfied with his statement that he
was the sage Śunassakha. Yātudhānī became angry on
hearing it and insisted on his giving the meaning of his
name. Śunassakha with a single stroke with his
“tridaṇḍa” (trident) killed her. Śunassakha was really
Indra himself. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 93).
