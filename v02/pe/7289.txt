SUṢEṆA V¦. Father in-law of Bāli, the monkey king.
<div n="lb"/>Suṣeṇa, father of Tārā, deputed one thousand crore
<div n="lb"/>monkeys to search for Sītā. (Vana Parva, Chapter 283,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 2). Suṣeṇa, an expert in the science of medicine
<div n="lb"/>and the art of warfare, was the son of the monkey
<div n="lb"/>called Dharma. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war Suṣeṇa fought the Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>forces and killed Vidyunmālī. Lakṣmaṇa swooned
<div n="lb"/>on being hit by the arrows of Rāvaṇa who fought with
<div n="lb"/>redoubled vigour following the death of Indrajit. Many
<div n="lb"/>monkeys also swooned. Then Suṣeṇa, the medical
<div n="lb"/>expert, brought back to consciousness the swooned folk
<div n="lb"/>with the help of Viśalyakaraṇī, Sauvarṇyakaraṇī,
<div n="lb"/>Śañjīvanī and other herbs.
<div n="NI"/>Suṣeṇa also attended the coronation ceremony of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>101, 123, 154).
