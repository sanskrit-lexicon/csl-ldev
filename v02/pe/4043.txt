MĀDHAVA IV¦. A virtuous brahmin. Once when he was
about to sacrifice a goat in the sacrificial fire the goat
in human voice told the story of its previous birth and
requested the brahmin to sacrifice it after reciting the
ninth chapter of the Gītā. Mādhava did so and the goat
got salvation. (Uttara Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
