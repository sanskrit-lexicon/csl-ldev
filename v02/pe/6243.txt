SAPTADVIJA¦ (S). The seven Brahmins who killed and
ate on the way the cow brought for the teacher.
These seven Brahmins were the disciples of a teacher
in Kuṇḍinapura. Once owing to a severe famine people
were in a very difficult situation. The teacher sent these
seven disciples to beg for a cow from his son-in-law
who had a very large number of cows. They did
accordingly. The son in-law gave them a cow for his
father-in-law. The disciples began the return journey
with the cow. When they reached half-way they became
so weary and tired of hunger and walking that they
could not proceed a step further. When they reached
the stage of death, those celibates killed the cow
according to the Vedic rites, and ate the flesh. Carry-
ing the remaining flesh they reached the house of the
teacher and told him all the truth. As they had tried to
be righteous as far as possible, the teacher only felt
proud of his disciples. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañ-
cukālambaka, Taraṅga 1).
