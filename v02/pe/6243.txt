SAPTADVIJA¦ (S). The seven Brahmins who killed and
<div n="lb"/>ate on the way the cow brought for the teacher.
<div n="lb"/>These seven Brahmins were the disciples of a teacher
<div n="lb"/>in Kuṇḍinapura. Once owing to a severe famine people
<div n="lb"/>were in a very difficult situation. The teacher sent these
<div n="lb"/>seven disciples to beg for a cow from his son-in-law
<div n="lb"/>who had a very large number of cows. They did
<div n="lb"/>accordingly. The son in-law gave them a cow for his
<div n="lb"/>father-in-law. The disciples began the return journey
<div n="lb"/>with the cow. When they reached half-way they became
<div n="lb"/>so weary and tired of hunger and walking that they
<div n="lb"/>could not proceed a step further. When they reached
<div n="lb"/>the stage of death, those celibates killed the cow
<div n="lb"/>according to the Vedic rites, and ate the flesh. Carry-
<div n="lb"/>ing the remaining flesh they reached the house of the
<div n="lb"/>teacher and told him all the truth. As they had tried to
<div n="lb"/>be righteous as far as possible, the teacher only felt
<div n="lb"/>proud of his disciples. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañ-
<div n="lb"/>cukālambaka, Taraṅga 1).
