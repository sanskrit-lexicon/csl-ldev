KUŚANĀBHA¦. A son born to Kuśa of Vaidarbhī. (For
<div n="lb"/>Genealogy see under Viśvāmitra). Sage Kuśa had four
<div n="lb"/>sons, namely Kuśāmba, Kuśanābha, Asūrtarajasa and
<div n="lb"/>Vasu, and Kuśanābha built Mahodayapura and lived
<div n="lb"/>there. One hundred daughters were born to him of his
<div n="lb"/>wife Ghṛtācī. Vāyubhagavān once asked the girls to
<div n="lb"/>marry him at which proposal they laughed at him in
<div n="lb"/>derision. He cursed them and made them hunch-backed
<div n="lb"/>ugly women, and Kuśanābha felt very sorry about
<div n="lb"/>this cruel fate of his daughters.
<div n="NI"/>To Somadā, daughter of a Gandharva woman called
<div n="lb"/>Ūrmilā, had been born a son, Brahmadatta, due to the
<div n="lb"/>mental power of the sage Cūli Kuśanābha gave in
<div n="lb"/>marriage his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta, and
<div n="lb"/>they were cured of their hunch at the touch of Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>datta and became their previous beautiful selves.
<div n="NI"/>Kuśanābha conducted the yajña called Putrakāmeṣṭi,
<div n="lb"/>and Kuśa, who was so pleased by the yajña blessed him
<div n="lb"/>to have a son called Gādhi. Viśvāmitra was the son
<div n="lb"/>of this Gādhi. Viśvāmitra had also a sister Satyavatī,
<div n="lb"/>whom Ṛcīka wedded. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Cantos 32-35).
