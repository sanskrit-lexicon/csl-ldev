NAGARA¦. In ancient days there were rules and prin-
ciples regulating the construction of a city. The name
‘city’ could be applied to them only if they conformed
to the rules and principles in vogue. The principles
and rules of the erection of a proper city are given
below:—
<div n="NI"/>One yojana or a half of land should be selected as
site.
<F>1) A yojana is approximately twelve Kilometres.</F> The planning of the city should be commenced
after worshipping the deity of Vāstu. There should be
four main gates on the four sides, East, West, North
and South. The South gate should be in the position of
Gandharvapada, West gate in the place of Varuṇa, the
North gate in the place of Soma (Moon) and the East
fort gate in the place of Sūryapada (the position of the
Sun). The haṭṭas (minor gates) should be wide enough
for elephants etc. to pass through. The main gates
should be six rods wide.
<div n="NI"/>When the city is completed goldsmiths should be
settled in the Agni corner
<F>2) To know the corners see under Aṣṭadikpālakas.</F> (i. e. South East). The
courtesans who live by dancing etc. should have their
houses on the south side of the city. The houses of
[Page514-b+ 64]
actors, those who extract oil, fishermen etc. should be
in the corner of Nirṛti (South West). Sheds for chariots,
weapons, swords etc. should be on the western side.
Dealers in liquor, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons etc.
and servants should be given houses in the Vāyu
corner i.e. North West. The houses of Brahmins, hermits,
sages, saints, and such others should be on the north
side. In the Īśāna corner (North East) merchants of
vegetables and on the eastern side, the authorities of
the army should have their houses.
<div n="NI"/>The army (Infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants)
should be put up in the Agni corner. On the south the
goddesses who are protectors of women-folk should be
consecrated. Archers should live in the Nirṛti corner.
Most honourable people, Treasury officers, Leaders of
the people, Brahmin groups and such others should
have their abodes on the western side. So also Kṣatri-
yas should have their houses on the eastern side,
Vaiśyas on the south and Śūdras on the west of the
city. Vaiśyas and horses should be placed on all four
sides. The army also should be placed thus. The
movable wealth should be placed on the east side
and the funeral place on the south. The cattle
etc. should be kept on the west, farmers on the
north, and the outcastes on the corners. This
should be the plan of a city as well as that of
villages too.
<div n="NI"/>On the east fort-gate of cities and villages Vaiśravaṇa
and Śrī Bhagavatī should be consecrated. They will
confer prosperity upon those who visit them. Temples
dedicated to Gods should be erected on the western
side facing the east. If temples are erected on the east
they should face the west and those erected on the
south should face the North. For the protection of the
city, there should be temples dedicated to Indra, Viṣṇu
and such other Gods. If there is no worshipping place
in a city, a village, a fort, or a house, such places will
be haunted by devils and troubled by diseases etc. If
cities are built according to this plan they will afford
both salvation and prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>On the east there should be the house of Lakṣmī, in
the Agni corner, the kitchen on the south, bedrooms
in the Nirṛti corner the weapon-house, on the west
the dining hall, in the Vāyu corner, the granary, on
the north, the treasury, and the place of worship in
the Īśāna corner.
<div n="NI"/>Houses could be erected with four blocks, three blocks
or only one block. Houses with four blocks could be
made in two hundred and fiftyfive ways by making
changes in each block and the open verandas. Houses
with three blocks are of four types; with two blocks
are of five types; and houses of only one block are of
four types. There are houses and cities with twenty-
eight open verandas. There are fiftyfive types of
houses with four open verandas and seven open
verandas. Houses with six open verandas and eight
open verandas are of twenty types. In cities houses
should have eight open verandas (Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 105).
