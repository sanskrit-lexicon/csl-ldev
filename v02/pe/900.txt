BĀLAKHILYA¦(S). (VĀLAKHILYAS). A group of
<div n="lb"/>hermits.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Sixty thousand hermits were born to Kratu,
<div n="lb"/>one of the Saptarṣis (seven hermits), by his wife,
<div n="lb"/>Santati.
<F>*) In some other Purāṇas the mother of Bālakhilyas is given the name ‘Sannati’. This may be a mistake in the manuscript.</F> They are called Bālakhilyas. Everyone of
<div n="lb"/>them was only the size of half a thumb, but they were
<div n="lb"/>as bright as the blazing sun and had attained control
<div n="lb"/>over their senses. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Garuḍa (Eagle) and Bālakhilya(s).%} A story connect-
<div n="lb"/>ing the birth of Garuḍa with Bālakhilyas occurs in
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kaśyapa Prajāpati performed a sacrifice to
<div n="lb"/>obtain children. The work of bringing firewood for
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice was entrusted to Indra and the other
<div n="lb"/>devas (Gods) and the Bālakhilyas. When Indra was
<div n="lb"/>heaping up on heaps pieces of big logs the Bālakhilyas
<div n="lb"/>who were very small were bringing in chips of
<div n="lb"/>wood. Seeing this Indra laughed. The Bālakhilyas
<div n="lb"/>got angry and stopping the work entrusted to them
<div n="lb"/>began to do penance with a view to create an-
<div n="lb"/>other Indra. Knowing this Indra was much flurried.
<div n="lb"/>He went to Kaśyapa and told him everything. Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>went to the Bālakhilyas and pacified them. At this time
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā, a wife of Kaśyapa, was doing penance to
<div n="lb"/>obtain a son. Kaśyapa said that the penance of the
<div n="lb"/>Bālakhilyas would not be fruitless and that as a result
<div n="lb"/>of their penance a son who would overpower Indra
<div n="lb"/>would be born to Vinatā. Accordingly a son was born
<div n="lb"/>to her. Garuḍa was that son. The fact that Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>overthrew Indra when he went to heaven for ambrosia,
<div n="lb"/>is well known. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 31).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Routine of life.%} The Bālakhilyas live in the maṇḍala
<div n="lb"/>of Sūrya (solar region). They travel in front of the sun
<div n="lb"/>in the shape of birds. They wear hides of animals. They
<div n="lb"/>are righteous and are only as big as a thumb. They are
<div n="lb"/>very ardent in doing the works of devas (Gods). They
<div n="lb"/>are sinless. There are Bālakhilyas living in the lunar
<div n="lb"/>region also. They worship the Sun daily. All the world
<div n="lb"/>stand firm in truth because of the penance of the
<div n="lb"/>Bālakhilyas. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 141.).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%} (1) Garuḍa (Eagle) who went
<div n="lb"/>to the realm of devas (gods) for Amrta (amb-
<div n="lb"/>rosia) took rest on the branch of a banyan tree, and
<div n="lb"/>that branch was broken from the tree. Sixty thousand
<div n="lb"/>Bālakhilyas were doing penance hanging head down-
<div n="lb"/>wards on that branch. Garuḍa knew this only after the
<div n="lb"/>branch was broken. Fearing the curse form them he took
<div n="lb"/>the branch in his beak and flew about here and there.
<div n="lb"/>At last, according to the advice of Kaśyapa, he took the
<div n="lb"/>branch to the mount Gandhamādana and without caus-
<div n="lb"/>ing any harm to the small hermits placed it there.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When Duṣyanta entered the hermitage of Kaṇva
<div n="lb"/>he saw the Bālakhilyas doing penance, hanging down
<div n="lb"/>on the trees in the vicinity. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 7).
<div n="NI"/>(3) In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 51, it
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned that the Bālakhilyas were engaged in
<div n="lb"/>prayer and meditations and offering oblations to fire
<div n="lb"/>in the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="NI"/>(4) It is mentioned in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 51, that in the period of the Rāmāyaṇa, in
<div n="lb"/>South India, when Rāvaṇa was going to the house of
<div n="lb"/>Mārīca, he saw the Bālakhilyas doing penance.
<div n="NI"/>(5) The Bālakhilyas learned the Vedas and Śāstras
<div n="lb"/>(scriptures) sitting in the chariot of the sun. (Kampa
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Pūrvakāṇḍa).
