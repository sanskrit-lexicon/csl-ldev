BĀLAKHILYA¦(S). (VĀLAKHILYAS). A group of
hermits.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Sixty thousand hermits were born to Kratu,
one of the Saptarṣis (seven hermits), by his wife,
Santati.
<F>*) In some other Purāṇas the mother of Bālakhilyas is given the name ‘Sannati’. This may be a mistake in the manuscript.</F> They are called Bālakhilyas. Everyone of
them was only the size of half a thumb, but they were
as bright as the blazing sun and had attained control
over their senses. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Garuḍa (Eagle) and Bālakhilya(s).%} A story connect-
ing the birth of Garuḍa with Bālakhilyas occurs in
the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kaśyapa Prajāpati performed a sacrifice to
obtain children. The work of bringing firewood for
the sacrifice was entrusted to Indra and the other
devas (Gods) and the Bālakhilyas. When Indra was
heaping up on heaps pieces of big logs the Bālakhilyas
who were very small were bringing in chips of
wood. Seeing this Indra laughed. The Bālakhilyas
got angry and stopping the work entrusted to them
began to do penance with a view to create an-
other Indra. Knowing this Indra was much flurried.
He went to Kaśyapa and told him everything. Kaśyapa
went to the Bālakhilyas and pacified them. At this time
Vinatā, a wife of Kaśyapa, was doing penance to
obtain a son. Kaśyapa said that the penance of the
Bālakhilyas would not be fruitless and that as a result
of their penance a son who would overpower Indra
would be born to Vinatā. Accordingly a son was born
to her. Garuḍa was that son. The fact that Garuḍa
overthrew Indra when he went to heaven for ambrosia,
is well known. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 31).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Routine of life.%} The Bālakhilyas live in the maṇḍala
of Sūrya (solar region). They travel in front of the sun
in the shape of birds. They wear hides of animals. They
are righteous and are only as big as a thumb. They are
very ardent in doing the works of devas (Gods). They
are sinless. There are Bālakhilyas living in the lunar
region also. They worship the Sun daily. All the world
stand firm in truth because of the penance of the
Bālakhilyas. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 141.).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%} (1) Garuḍa (Eagle) who went
to the realm of devas (gods) for Amrta (amb-
rosia) took rest on the branch of a banyan tree, and
that branch was broken from the tree. Sixty thousand
Bālakhilyas were doing penance hanging head down-
wards on that branch. Garuḍa knew this only after the
branch was broken. Fearing the curse form them he took
the branch in his beak and flew about here and there.
At last, according to the advice of Kaśyapa, he took the
branch to the mount Gandhamādana and without caus-
ing any harm to the small hermits placed it there.
(M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When Duṣyanta entered the hermitage of Kaṇva
he saw the Bālakhilyas doing penance, hanging down
on the trees in the vicinity. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 7).
<div n="NI"/>(3) In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 51, it
is mentioned that the Bālakhilyas were engaged in
prayer and meditations and offering oblations to fire
in the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="NI"/>(4) It is mentioned in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
Sarga 51, that in the period of the Rāmāyaṇa, in
South India, when Rāvaṇa was going to the house of
Mārīca, he saw the Bālakhilyas doing penance.
<div n="NI"/>(5) The Bālakhilyas learned the Vedas and Śāstras
(scriptures) sitting in the chariot of the sun. (Kampa
Rāmāyaṇa, Pūrvakāṇḍa).
