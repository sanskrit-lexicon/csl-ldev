PAÑCAJA I¦. (PAÑCAJANA). A mighty asura. This
<div n="lb"/>asura lived inside a conch. Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed this asura.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma were having their
<div n="lb"/>education in the āśrama of the sage Sāndīpani. On the
<div n="lb"/>eve of their completing their education an asura
<div n="lb"/>named Pañcaja carried away the son of the sage while
<div n="lb"/>the child was bathing in the Prabhāsatīrtha and kept
<div n="lb"/>him inside a conch where the asura lived. The sage,
<div n="lb"/>greatly griefstricken asked his disciples to get him back
<div n="lb"/>his son as his Gurudakṣiṇā (fees for the preceptor).
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma went to the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river and prayed to Varuṇa. Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>appeared before them and then they told him about
<div n="lb"/>the mishap. With the help of Varuṇa they killed the
<div n="lb"/>asura Pañcaja and got back the son of their guru. The
<div n="lb"/>conch in which the asura lived was taken by Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Because the conch belonged to Pañcaja the conch got
<div n="lb"/>the name Pāñcajanya. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
