PARAŚURĀMA¦. An incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu, as man.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Māhāviṣṇu—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā-Bhṛgu-Cyavana-Ūrva-Ṛcīka-Jamadagni-
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Cause for incarnation.%} Once god Agni went to Kārta-
<div n="lb"/>vīryārjuna and begged for food. The king allowed him
<div n="lb"/>to take from his vast territory as much food as he wanted
<div n="lb"/>from anywhere he liked. Agni started burning forests
<div n="lb"/>and mountains and consuming them. Deep inside. one
<div n="lb"/>of the forests a sage named Āpava was performing
<div n="lb"/>penance and the fire burnt the āśrama of Āpava also.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this the sage cursed thus: “Kārtavīryārjuna
<div n="lb"/>is at the root of this havoc. The arrogance of Kṣatriyas
<div n="lb"/>has increased beyond limits. Mahāviṣṇu would there-
<div n="lb"/>fore be born on earth as Paraśurāma to destroy this
<div n="lb"/>arrogance of the Kṣatriyas.” Accordingly Māhāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was born as Paraśurāma in the Bhārgava race. (Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 40, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa gives another version: Viṣṇu pro-
<div n="lb"/>mised Bhūmidevī (mother earth) that he would be born
<div n="lb"/>on earth as Paraśurāma when Bhūmidevī went to him in
<div n="lb"/>the form of a cow and complained to him about the
<div n="lb"/>atrocities of the wicked Kṣatriya kings.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} Paraśurāma was born as the son of sage
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni of his wife Reṇukā. Their āśrama was on
<div n="lb"/>the shores of the Narmadā river. Reṇukā, mother of
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma, was the daughter of King Prasenajit. She
<div n="lb"/>had four sons even before the birth of Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 58, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boyhood and education.%} Paraśurāma spent his boyhood
<div n="lb"/>with his parents in the āśrama. An important event
<div n="lb"/>in his life then was his slaying his mother at the behest
<div n="lb"/>of his father. (See under Jamadagni, Para 6). Though
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma was a brahmin there is nothing on record
<div n="lb"/>to show that he did study the Vedas. Perhaps he might
<div n="lb"/>have had the Vedic instructions from his father during
<div n="lb"/>his life with him. He had even from the beginning
<div n="lb"/>shown an interest in learning Dhanurvidyā (archery).
<div n="lb"/>For obtaining proficiency in archery he went to the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas and did penance to please Śiva for many
<div n="lb"/>years. Pleased at his penance Śiva on several occasions
<div n="lb"/>extolled the virtues of Paraśurāma. At that time the
<div n="lb"/>asuras (demons) acquired strength and attacked the
<div n="lb"/>devas. The devas complained to Śiva. Śiva called
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma and asked him to fight with and defeat
[Page569-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the demons. Paraśurāma was without weapons and he
<div n="lb"/>asked Śiva how he could go and fight the demons
<div n="lb"/>without weapons. Śiva said: “Go with my blessings
<div n="lb"/>end you will kill your foes.” Para urāma did not wait
<div n="lb"/>for a moment. When Śiva thus assured him of success,
<div n="lb"/>on he went straight to fight with the demons. He
<div n="lb"/>defeated the asuras and came back to Śiva when the
<div n="lb"/>latter gave him many boons and divine weapons.
<div n="NI"/>Till that time his name was only Rāma and he became
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma because among the weapons given to him
<div n="lb"/>by Śiva was a weapon named Paraśu (axe). There is a
<div n="lb"/>story behind this weapon Paraśu. Once Śiva was not
<div n="lb"/>invited for a Yāga conducted by Dakṣa. An angered
<div n="lb"/>Śiva threw his spike into the Yāgaśālā (sacrifical hall).
<div n="lb"/>The spike spoiled the Yāga and smashed the hall and
<div n="lb"/>after that roamed about aimlessly for sometime and
<div n="lb"/>then turned towards Badaryāśrama where at that time
<div n="lb"/>Naranārāyaṇas were engaged in penance. The spike
<div n="lb"/>went straight to the heart of sage Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>made the defiant sound ‘hum’ (huṃkāra) and the spike
<div n="lb"/>turned away. Śiva felt angry for thus showing disres-
<div n="lb"/>pect to his spike and he attacked the sage. At once
<div n="lb"/>Nararṣi plucked a grass and reciting a mantra threw it
<div n="lb"/>at Śiva. The grass became a Paraśu (axe) and it
<div n="lb"/>attacked Śiva. Śiva broke it into two. Then Nara-
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇas bowed before him and worshipped him. There-
<div n="lb"/>after the two pieces of the Paraśu remained with Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>It was one of these that Śiva gave to Paraśurāma.
<div n="lb"/>When Paraśurāma was returning happy and glorious
<div n="lb"/>with boons and weapons he got on his way a disciple
<div n="lb"/>named Akṛtavraṇa. (See under Akṛtavraṇa). Guru and
<div n="lb"/>disciple lived in an āśrama and Paraśurāma became a
<div n="lb"/>noted Guru in dhanurveda (archery). (Chapter 34,
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa Parva; Chapter 49, Śānti Parva and Chapter 18,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Instruction in archery.%} According to Purāṇas Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāmā did not spend his life as an instructor in archery.
<div n="lb"/>There are statements, however, mentioning that Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Droṇa took instructions from him.
<div n="NI"/>Pretending to be a brahmin Karṇa commenced taking
<div n="lb"/>instructions in archeṛy from Paraśurāma. When his
<div n="lb"/>education was complete Paraśurāma taught him
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāstra. One day tired after a long walk in the
<div n="lb"/>forests Paraśurāma took rest placing his head on the
<div n="lb"/>lap of Karṇa and soon fell asleep. At that time a beetle
<div n="lb"/>came and started sucking blood from the thigh of
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa. Karṇa remained still, bearing the pain, lest
<div n="lb"/>any movement of his body should disturb the sleep of
<div n="lb"/>his Guru. Blood was oozing from his thighs and it
<div n="lb"/>slowly made the body of the Guru also wet. Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>woke up and the sight of the bleeding thigh and the
<div n="lb"/>calm demeanour of Karṇa raised doubts in him. He
<div n="lb"/>questioned Karṇa saying that no brahmin could ever
<div n="lb"/>bear such a pain with such calmness and Karṇa had to
<div n="lb"/>tell the truth. Then Paraśurāma cursed him for deceit
<div n="lb"/>against his Guru saying that he would never be able
<div n="lb"/>to remember the Brahmāstra when the time to use
<div n="lb"/>it came.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story behind Alarka, the beetle that bit
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa. This beetle was in his previous birth a demon
<div n="lb"/>named Daṃśa. Daṃśa once tried to molest the wife of the
<div n="lb"/>sage Bhṛgu. The Maharṣi cursed him and made him into
<div n="lb"/>a beetle. On his request for mercy he said he would
<div n="lb"/>get release from the curse by Paraśurāma. So the beetle
[Page569-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>became the Rākṣasa again and left the place. Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>took leave of Paraśurāma and went to Hastināpura.
<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>Another famous disciple of Paraśurāma was Droṇa.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story behind Droṇa getting Dhanurveda
<div n="lb"/>from Paraśurāma. After travelling throughout the world
<div n="lb"/>exterminating the Kṣatriya race Paraśurāma gave all his
<div n="lb"/>wealth to Kaśyapa. On hearing that Paraśurāma was
<div n="lb"/>giving away all his riches as gifts to brahmins Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>rushed to Mahendraparvata to see Paraśurāma. By then
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma had distributed all his wealth excepting
<div n="lb"/>Dhanurveda. Paraśurāma called Droṇa to his side and
<div n="lb"/>said that only two things remained with him, his body
<div n="lb"/>and Dhanurveda. Droṇa, he added, could take anyone
<div n="lb"/>of the two and then Droṇa took Dhanurveda from him.
<div n="lb"/>After that Paraśurāma went to Mahāraṇya for the sake
<div n="lb"/>of penance. (Chapter 130, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>There are some apparent inconsistencies in the above
<div n="lb"/>stories: It is said Droṇa taught Dhanurveda to Karṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa was the last person to receive Dhanurveda from
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma because the latter, surrendering his Dhanur-
<div n="lb"/>veda in entire, left for the forests for doing penance.
<div n="lb"/>Then, when did Karṇa learn Dhanurveda from Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma? Could it be before Droṇa went to Paraśurāma?
<div n="lb"/>Then it must be accepted that Droṇa had not studied
<div n="lb"/>under Paraśurāma when he was teaching the
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas. He learnt it from some-
<div n="lb"/>where before he became the preceptor of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa after studying under Droṇa for some time went
<div n="lb"/>to Paraśurāma for higher studies and Droṇa approached
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma after Karṇa had left him.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The destruction of the Kṣatriyas.%} The most important
<div n="lb"/>event of his life was the total extermination of the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya race. The Purāṇic belief is that he went
<div n="lb"/>round the world eighteen times to massacre the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>In many places in the Purāṇas it is stated that Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>fought against the Kṣatriyas eighteen times. But in
<div n="lb"/>chapter 29 of Aśvamedha Parva it is stated that Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma fought against the Kṣatriyas twentyone times
<div n="lb"/>So it is to be surmised that Paraśurāma fought eighteen
<div n="lb"/>big battles and three minor ones.
<div n="NI"/>There are some old stories to explain this revengeful
<div n="lb"/>enmity of Paraśurāma towards the Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Family enmity.%} The Hehaya dynasty was the most
<div n="lb"/>powerful kingly race then. Paraśurāma was a descend-
<div n="lb"/>ant of Bhṛgu, a brahmin sage. That is why he gets
<div n="lb"/>the name Bhārgava also. The Bhārgavas were for gene-
<div n="lb"/>rations the family preceptors of the Hehaya kings.
<div n="lb"/>Taking advantage of their supreme position in the royal
<div n="lb"/>palace the Bhārgavas accumulated great wealth at the
<div n="lb"/>cost of the royal riches. Gradually the Bhārgavas rose
<div n="lb"/>in prosperity in inverse proportion to the decline of
<div n="lb"/>the Hehaya wealth. It was at the time of Ṛcīka, grand-
<div n="lb"/>father of Parasurāma that they touched the rock-bottom
<div n="lb"/>of their wealth and they found funds lacking even for
<div n="lb"/>the day to day administration of the state. In despair
<div n="lb"/>they went and requested the Ṛcīkas to lend them some
<div n="lb"/>money. But they hid their money and refused to give
<div n="lb"/>them anything. The Kṣatriya kings got angry and
<div n="lb"/>killed the brahmins. What stock was left of them went
<div n="lb"/>to the base of the Himālayas. The wife of Ṛcīka who
<div n="lb"/>was pregnant then kept the child in her womb for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years afraid to bring forth the child. After that the
[Page570-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>child came out breaking open the thigh (ūru) and
<div n="lb"/>so the child was called Aurva. Even at the time of his
<div n="lb"/>birth Aurva shone like a brilliant torch and not only
<div n="lb"/>that; the child cried aloud “Oh, wicked Kṣatriyas, I
<div n="lb"/>will kill every one of you. I heard from my mother's
<div n="lb"/>womb the din of the swords you raised to kill my
<div n="lb"/>ancestors. I will never wait for another moment to wreak
<div n="lb"/>vengeance on you.”
<div n="NI"/>The fire that emanated from the face of Aurva burnt
<div n="lb"/>even Devaloka. Kṣatriyas as a class came and prostrated
<div n="lb"/>before him. The devas came and requested him to
<div n="lb"/>abandon his anger and Aurva agreed. The devas picked
<div n="lb"/>up the fire sparks from Aurva's face and deposited
<div n="lb"/>them in the ocean. From those sparks put in the ocean
<div n="lb"/>was born Baḍavāgni alias Aurva.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Curse of the sage.%} From Aurva was born Jamadagni
<div n="lb"/>and from Jamadagni was born Paraśurāma. In the
<div n="lb"/>race of the Hehayas was born at that time a very valor-
<div n="lb"/>ous king named Kārtavīryārjuna. Once Kārtavīryārjuna
<div n="lb"/>gave a dinner to Agnibhagavān. Agni began to devour all
<div n="lb"/>the mountains and forests in the world. The burning was
<div n="lb"/>so indiscriminate that it burnt the āśrama of a sage
<div n="lb"/>named Āpava also. The sage cursed Kārtavīryārjuna
<div n="lb"/>saying that the thousand hands of the latter would be
<div n="lb"/>cut off by Pasaśurāma born in the family of Bhārgavas.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards the latent feud in him against
<div n="lb"/>the Bhārgavas was roused into action.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Varuṇa's ridicule.%} Kārtavīryārjuna who got a thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand hands by a boon from a sage named Dattātreya
<div n="lb"/>subdued all enemies of his status and not satisfied
<div n="lb"/>with that he went to the shores of the ocean and chall-
<div n="lb"/>enged Varuṇa for a fight. Varuṇa came before him and
<div n="lb"/>very modestly admitted that he was incapable of meet-
<div n="lb"/>ing the challenge thrown and suggested that perhaps
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni's son, Paraśurāma might accept the chall-
<div n="lb"/>enge and give him a fight. Hearing this Kārtavīryār-
<div n="lb"/>juna turned towards the āsrama of Jamadagni on the
<div n="lb"/>shores of the Narmadā river.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Causes of the war (immediate).%} Kārtavīryārjuna went
<div n="lb"/>for hunting in the forests and feeling exhausted after
<div n="lb"/>some time went to the āsrama of Jamadagni with his
<div n="lb"/>retinue. Jamadagni received them well and with the
<div n="lb"/>help of the Kāmadhenu (wish-yielding cow) named
<div n="lb"/>Suśīlā, Jamadagni gave a sumptuous feast to the King
<div n="lb"/>and his followers. When after the meals were over
<div n="lb"/>they started to take leave of the sage, Candragupta, a
<div n="lb"/>minister of Kārtavīryārjuna brought to the notice of the
<div n="lb"/>king the superior powers of the Kāmadhenu, Suśīlā. The
<div n="lb"/>king wanted to get the cow and asked Candragupta to
<div n="lb"/>tell the sage about it. Though the minister told Jama-
<div n="lb"/>dagni about the royal desire the sage refused to part
<div n="lb"/>with the cow. Then the minister with the help of the
<div n="lb"/>other royal servants took the cow by force and the sage
<div n="lb"/>followed the cow weeping. On the way Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>beat Jamadagni to death and brought the cow to the
<div n="lb"/>presence of the king. The king was pleased and the royal
<div n="lb"/>hunting party returned to the palace happy.
<div n="NI"/>Jamadagni's wife Reṇukā went in search of her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band and to her grief found him lying dead. Reṇukā
<div n="lb"/>wept beating her breast twentyone times and by that
<div n="lb"/>time her son Para urāma came there and he declared
<div n="lb"/>that he would travel round the world twentyone times,
<div n="lb"/>the number of times his mother beat her breast, to kill
<div n="lb"/>and exterminate the Kṣatriyas from this world. Then
<div n="lb"/>the dead body of Jamadagni was placed on a pyre and
[Page570-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>they were singing Viṣṇugītā before placing fire on the
<div n="lb"/>pyre when Śukramuni appeared there and brought
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni to life by invoking the art of Mṛtasañjīvanī.
<div n="lb"/>By that time Suśīlā somehow escaped from the custody
<div n="lb"/>of the King and came there without the calf. Then
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma vowed that he would bring the calf soon and
<div n="lb"/>taking with him his disciple Akṛtavraṇa he left for the
<div n="lb"/>city of Māhiṣmatī the abode of Kārtavīryārjuna. There
<div n="lb"/>they fought a grim battle and after killing Kārtavīryār-
<div n="lb"/>juna and many of his followers brought back the calf.
<div n="lb"/>To atone for the sin of this massacre Jamadagni advised
<div n="lb"/>his son to go and perform penance in Mahendragiri.
<div n="lb"/>Taking advantage of the absence of Paraśurāma from
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama, Śūrasena son of Kārtavīryārjuna, with his
<div n="lb"/>followers went to the āśrama of Jamadagni and chop-
<div n="lb"/>ped off his head. Paraśurāma returned from Mahend-
<div n="lb"/>ragiri at once and cremated the dead body of his father.
<div n="lb"/>Reṇukā, his mother, jumped into the funeral pyre
<div n="lb"/>and abandoned her life. From that moment onwards
<div n="lb"/>started Paraśurāma's fierce programme of mass mass-
<div n="lb"/>acre of the Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Victory march.%} Paraśurāma's world-tour was con-
<div n="lb"/>fined to an all-Bhārata tour. The wars of Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>are not described in detail in the Purāṇas. They men-
<div n="lb"/>tion thaṭ Paraśurāma killed the Kings of Cola, Cera
<div n="lb"/>and Pauṇḍra. To stop the birth of Kṣatriyas in future
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma destroyed even the embryo in the wombs
<div n="lb"/>of Kṣatariya women. Then the Bhārgava ancestors like
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka and others came to the sky and requested Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma to stop this slaughter. They said: “Oh son,
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, stop this slaughter. What good do you get by
<div n="lb"/>killing innocent Kṣatriyas?” By that time Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>had made twentyone rounds around Bhārata killing the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas. (Chapter 64, Ādi Parva; Chapter 38, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva; Chapter 116, Vana Parva; Chapter 49, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva and 10 chapters from chapter 83 of Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Samantapañcakanirmāṇa.%} Samantapañcaka is Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra itself where the great battle was conducted.
<div n="lb"/>This is a holy place and it was Paraśurāma who
<div n="lb"/>constructed it. He stored the blood of the Kṣatriyas he
<div n="lb"/>killed in the twentyone rounds of killing in five lakes in
<div n="lb"/>Samantapañcaka. He offered blood to the Manes in
<div n="lb"/>those lakes. The Manes led by Ṛcīka appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him and asked him to name any boon he wanted. Then
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma said, “Revered Manes, if you are pleased
<div n="lb"/>with me you must absolve me from the sin of this mass
<div n="lb"/>massacre of the Kṣatriyas and declare the five lakes
<div n="lb"/>where I have stored their blood as holy.” The Manes
<div n="lb"/>declared, “Let it be so.” From then onwards the
<div n="lb"/>place became holy under the name Samantapañcaka.
<div n="lb"/>At the end of the Dvāparayuga and the beginning of
<div n="lb"/>Kaliyuga a great battle lasting for eighteen days took
<div n="lb"/>place at this holy place between the Pāṇḍavas and the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas. (Chapter 2, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Atonement.%} To atone for the sin of slaughtering even
<div n="lb"/>innocent Kṣatriyas, Paraśurāma gave away all his
<div n="lb"/>riches as gifts to brahmins. He invited all the brahmins
<div n="lb"/>to Samantapañcaka and conducted a great Yāga there.
<div n="lb"/>The chief Ṛtvik (officiating priest) of the Yāga was
<div n="lb"/>the sage Kaśyapa and Paraśurāma gave all the lands
<div n="lb"/>he conquered till that time to Kaśyapa. Then a plat-
<div n="lb"/>form of gold ten yards long and nine yards wide was
<div n="lb"/>made and Kaśyapa was installed there and worshipped.
<div n="lb"/>After the worship was over according to the instructions
[Page571-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>from Kaśyapa the gold platform was cut into pieces
<div n="lb"/>and the gold pieces were offered to brahmins.
<div n="NI"/>When Kaśyapa got all the lands from Paraśurāma he
<div n="lb"/>said thus:—“Oh Rāma, you have given me all your
<div n="lb"/>land and it is not now proper for you to live in my
<div n="lb"/>soil. You can go to the south and live somewhere on
<div n="lb"/>the shores of the ocean there.” Paraśurāma walked
<div n="lb"/>south and requested the ocean to give him some land to
<div n="lb"/>live. Varuṇa then asked him to throw a winnow into
<div n="lb"/>the ocean. There is a legend saying that it was a
<div n="lb"/>Paraśu that Paraśurāma threw. Paraśurāma threw the
<div n="lb"/>sieve (śūrpa) and the ocean gave way to land for a
<div n="lb"/>distance where the winnow fell from where he stood.
<div n="lb"/>This is the place Śūrpāraka now known as Kerala.
<div n="lb"/>(Śūrpa = Winnowing basket). After giving this land
<div n="lb"/>also to the brahmins, Paraśurāma went and started
<div n="lb"/>doing penance at Mahendragiri. (Chapter 130, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva; Chapter 117, Vana Parva and Chapter 49,
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other exploits of Paraśurāma.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Meets Śrī Rāma.%} Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
<div n="lb"/>returning to Ayodhyā from Mithilāpurī after the
<div n="lb"/>marriage along with the sage Vasiṣṭha through a deep
<div n="lb"/>forest when Paraśurāma blocked their way and add-
<div n="lb"/>ressing Śrī Rāma said thus, ‘Oh Rāma, son of Daśaratha,
<div n="lb"/>I heard that you broke during the marriage of Sītā the
<div n="lb"/>great Śaiva bow of the palace of Janaka. It was a
<div n="lb"/>Śaiva bow and I have now come here to test your
<div n="lb"/>prowess. I am giving you a Vaiṣṇava bow now. Can
<div n="lb"/>you string this bow?”
<div n="NI"/>Vasiṣṭha tried his best to pacify Paraśurāma. But
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma without heeding it started describing the
<div n="lb"/>story and greatness of the Śaiva bow and the Vaiṣṇava
<div n="lb"/>bow. (See under Vaiṣṇava bow). Then Śrī Rāma took
<div n="lb"/>the bow from Paraśurāma and started to string it. The
<div n="lb"/>brilliance of Śrī Rāma dazzled him and he stood
<div n="lb"/>dumbfounded at his skill. Paraśurāma was immensely
<div n="lb"/>pleased and he blessed Śrī Rāma. After that he went
<div n="lb"/>again to Mahendragiri to perform penance.
<div n="NI"/>This same story is told in Kamba Rāmāyaṇa with
<div n="lb"/>some slight changes:—Paraśurāma did not like Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma breaking the bow of his Guru Śiva. So an
<div n="lb"/>angered Paraśurāma blocked the way of Śrī Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>challenged him to string and take aim with the mighty
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇava bow he (Paraśurāma) was carrying with him
<div n="lb"/>then. Śrī Rāma with perfect ease took the bow, strung
<div n="lb"/>it, and taking the missile asked Paraśurāma to show the
<div n="lb"/>target. Paraśurāma was astonished and was in a fix.
<div n="lb"/>The missile could destroy even the entire Universe. So
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma asked Rāma to aim at the accumulated
<div n="lb"/>tapobala (power accrued by penance) of his self and
<div n="lb"/>Rāma did so. Then Paraśurāma surrendered to Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma the Vaiṣṇava bow and arrow and the Vaiṣṇava
<div n="lb"/>tejas (divine brilliance) in him. Paraśurāma after
<div n="lb"/>having carried out the purpose of his incarnation gave
<div n="lb"/>instructions to Śrī Rāma to continue the purpose of his
<div n="lb"/>incarnation and then after blessing Śrī Rāma went
<div n="lb"/>again to do penance at his holy āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>This same story is told by the sage Lomaśa to the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas during their exile in the forests. This story is
<div n="lb"/>much different from the previous ones: “When the
<div n="lb"/>fame that Śrī Rāma was the best of Kings spread far
<div n="lb"/>and wide Paraśurāma once went to see Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>Giving him the bow and arrow with which he had
<div n="lb"/>done the mass massacre of the Kṣatriyas he challenged
[Page571-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>him to string it and take aim. With a smile Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>did so and then Paraśurāma said Rāma should draw
<div n="lb"/>the string up to his ears. Śrī Rāma got angry and then
<div n="lb"/>on the face, which became fierce, by his anger, Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma saw besides himself, Āditya-Vasu-Rudras, Sādh-
<div n="lb"/>yas, Bālakhilyas, Devarṣis, oceans, mountains, the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and all such things of this universe. Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>sent out his missile from the bow. The whole universe
<div n="lb"/>was thrown into chaos. Thunder and lightning rocked
<div n="lb"/>the world. Heavy rains flooded the whole land space.
<div n="lb"/>Burning stars and meteors fell to the ground. Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma then knew that Śrī Rāma was the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu and he stood bowing before him. Ashamed
<div n="lb"/>of his defeat he took leave of Śrī Rāma and went to
<div n="lb"/>Mahendragiri. When he reached there he found he had
<div n="lb"/>lost all his brilliance. Then the manes appeared and
<div n="lb"/>advised him to go and bathe in the river Vadhū-
<div n="lb"/>sarā. Accordingly Paraśurāma went and bathed in the
<div n="lb"/>river and regained his lost brilliance. (Chapter 99,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Paraśurāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} The Purāṇas describe
<div n="lb"/>two important occasions when Paraśurāma met Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>The first meeting was at the mountain of Gomanta.
<div n="lb"/>Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma with a view to enjoying
<div n="lb"/>the abundance of Nature went to the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>mountain of Gomanta and ascended to its top. On their
<div n="lb"/>way they met Paraśurāma engaged in penance there. They
<div n="lb"/>exchanged greetings and talked to each other for some
<div n="lb"/>time. Then Paraśurāma requested Śrī Kṛṣṇa to kill
<div n="lb"/>Śṛgālavāsudeva, King of Karavīra on the base of that
<div n="lb"/>mountain. Śrī Kṛṣṇa promised to do so and left the
<div n="lb"/>place carrying with him the blessings of the sage.
<div n="NI"/>The second meeting was when Kṛṣṇa was going to the
<div n="lb"/>court of the Kauravas as a messenger of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>On his way Śrī Kṛṣṇa saw a company of sages coming
<div n="lb"/>and, alighting from his chariot Kṛṣṇa talked with them.
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma who was in that company then embraced
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and said that he should give a true picture of
<div n="lb"/>the situation to the Kauravas when he was conducting
<div n="lb"/>his mission. The sages blessed Kṛṣṇa and wished Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>all success in his mission. (Chapter 83, Udyoga Parva;
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Paraśurāma along with a few other sages was
<div n="lb"/>present at the Sabhāpraveśa of Dharmaputra. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>11, Chapter 53, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Paraśurāma was present at the course of the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas when Śrī Kṛṣṇa was speaking to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas. When the Kauravas did not
<div n="lb"/>reply the questions put by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Paraśurāma rose
<div n="lb"/>up to tell a story to illustrate the evils resulting from
<div n="lb"/>the arrogance of man. There was once a King called
<div n="lb"/>Dambhodbhava who was very arrogant because of his
<div n="lb"/>great strength. He wanted to diffuse his energy by
<div n="lb"/>fighting and laboured much to get good opponents and
<div n="lb"/>roamed about in search of fighters. One day the
<div n="lb"/>brahmins directed him to Naranārāyaṇas and accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly Dambhodbhava went to their āśrama at
<div n="lb"/>Badarikā and challenged them for a fight. They refused
<div n="lb"/>to fight and yet the King showered arrows on them.
<div n="lb"/>Then the sages took a few blades of the iṣīkā grass and
<div n="lb"/>threw them at him. They filled the sky as great
<div n="lb"/>missiles and the King begged to be pardoned and
<div n="lb"/>prostrated before the sages. They sent back the be-
[Page572-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>fooled King to his palace. (Chapter 96, Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once a grim battle was waged between Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma and Bhīṣma. (See under Ambā).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Paraśurāma sits in the court of Yama. (Śloka 19,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 8, Sabhā Parva).
