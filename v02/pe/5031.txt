PARAŚURĀMA¦. An incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu, as man.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Māhāviṣṇu—
Brahmā-Bhṛgu-Cyavana-Ūrva-Ṛcīka-Jamadagni-
Paraśurāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Cause for incarnation.%} Once god Agni went to Kārta-
vīryārjuna and begged for food. The king allowed him
to take from his vast territory as much food as he wanted
from anywhere he liked. Agni started burning forests
and mountains and consuming them. Deep inside. one
of the forests a sage named Āpava was performing
penance and the fire burnt the āśrama of Āpava also.
Enraged at this the sage cursed thus: “Kārtavīryārjuna
is at the root of this havoc. The arrogance of Kṣatriyas
has increased beyond limits. Mahāviṣṇu would there-
fore be born on earth as Paraśurāma to destroy this
arrogance of the Kṣatriyas.” Accordingly Māhāviṣṇu
was born as Paraśurāma in the Bhārgava race. (Chap-
ter 40, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa gives another version: Viṣṇu pro-
mised Bhūmidevī (mother earth) that he would be born
on earth as Paraśurāma when Bhūmidevī went to him in
the form of a cow and complained to him about the
atrocities of the wicked Kṣatriya kings.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} Paraśurāma was born as the son of sage
Jamadagni of his wife Reṇukā. Their āśrama was on
the shores of the Narmadā river. Reṇukā, mother of
Paraśurāma, was the daughter of King Prasenajit. She
had four sons even before the birth of Paraśurāma
(Chapter 58, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boyhood and education.%} Paraśurāma spent his boyhood
with his parents in the āśrama. An important event
in his life then was his slaying his mother at the behest
of his father. (See under Jamadagni, Para 6). Though
Paraśurāma was a brahmin there is nothing on record
to show that he did study the Vedas. Perhaps he might
have had the Vedic instructions from his father during
his life with him. He had even from the beginning
shown an interest in learning Dhanurvidyā (archery).
For obtaining proficiency in archery he went to the
Himālayas and did penance to please Śiva for many
years. Pleased at his penance Śiva on several occasions
extolled the virtues of Paraśurāma. At that time the
asuras (demons) acquired strength and attacked the
devas. The devas complained to Śiva. Śiva called
Paraśurāma and asked him to fight with and defeat
[Page569-a+ 64]
the demons. Paraśurāma was without weapons and he
asked Śiva how he could go and fight the demons
without weapons. Śiva said: “Go with my blessings
end you will kill your foes.” Para urāma did not wait
for a moment. When Śiva thus assured him of success,
on he went straight to fight with the demons. He
defeated the asuras and came back to Śiva when the
latter gave him many boons and divine weapons.
<div n="NI"/>Till that time his name was only Rāma and he became
Paraśurāma because among the weapons given to him
by Śiva was a weapon named Paraśu (axe). There is a
story behind this weapon Paraśu. Once Śiva was not
invited for a Yāga conducted by Dakṣa. An angered
Śiva threw his spike into the Yāgaśālā (sacrifical hall).
The spike spoiled the Yāga and smashed the hall and
after that roamed about aimlessly for sometime and
then turned towards Badaryāśrama where at that time
Naranārāyaṇas were engaged in penance. The spike
went straight to the heart of sage Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa
made the defiant sound ‘hum’ (huṃkāra) and the spike
turned away. Śiva felt angry for thus showing disres-
pect to his spike and he attacked the sage. At once
Nararṣi plucked a grass and reciting a mantra threw it
at Śiva. The grass became a Paraśu (axe) and it
attacked Śiva. Śiva broke it into two. Then Nara-
Nārāyaṇas bowed before him and worshipped him. There-
after the two pieces of the Paraśu remained with Śiva.
It was one of these that Śiva gave to Paraśurāma.
When Paraśurāma was returning happy and glorious
with boons and weapons he got on his way a disciple
named Akṛtavraṇa. (See under Akṛtavraṇa). Guru and
disciple lived in an āśrama and Paraśurāma became a
noted Guru in dhanurveda (archery). (Chapter 34,
Karṇa Parva; Chapter 49, Śānti Parva and Chapter 18,
Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Instruction in archery.%} According to Purāṇas Paraśu-
rāmā did not spend his life as an instructor in archery.
There are statements, however, mentioning that Karṇa
and Droṇa took instructions from him.
<div n="NI"/>Pretending to be a brahmin Karṇa commenced taking
instructions in archeṛy from Paraśurāma. When his
education was complete Paraśurāma taught him
Brahmāstra. One day tired after a long walk in the
forests Paraśurāma took rest placing his head on the
lap of Karṇa and soon fell asleep. At that time a beetle
came and started sucking blood from the thigh of
Karṇa. Karṇa remained still, bearing the pain, lest
any movement of his body should disturb the sleep of
his Guru. Blood was oozing from his thighs and it
slowly made the body of the Guru also wet. Paraśurāma
woke up and the sight of the bleeding thigh and the
calm demeanour of Karṇa raised doubts in him. He
questioned Karṇa saying that no brahmin could ever
bear such a pain with such calmness and Karṇa had to
tell the truth. Then Paraśurāma cursed him for deceit
against his Guru saying that he would never be able
to remember the Brahmāstra when the time to use
it came.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story behind Alarka, the beetle that bit
Karṇa. This beetle was in his previous birth a demon
named Daṃśa. Daṃśa once tried to molest the wife of the
sage Bhṛgu. The Maharṣi cursed him and made him into
a beetle. On his request for mercy he said he would
get release from the curse by Paraśurāma. So the beetle
[Page569-b+ 64]
became the Rākṣasa again and left the place. Karṇa
took leave of Paraśurāma and went to Hastināpura.
(Śānti Parva, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>Another famous disciple of Paraśurāma was Droṇa.
There is a story behind Droṇa getting Dhanurveda
from Paraśurāma. After travelling throughout the world
exterminating the Kṣatriya race Paraśurāma gave all his
wealth to Kaśyapa. On hearing that Paraśurāma was
giving away all his riches as gifts to brahmins Droṇa
rushed to Mahendraparvata to see Paraśurāma. By then
Paraśurāma had distributed all his wealth excepting
Dhanurveda. Paraśurāma called Droṇa to his side and
said that only two things remained with him, his body
and Dhanurveda. Droṇa, he added, could take anyone
of the two and then Droṇa took Dhanurveda from him.
After that Paraśurāma went to Mahāraṇya for the sake
of penance. (Chapter 130, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>There are some apparent inconsistencies in the above
stories: It is said Droṇa taught Dhanurveda to Karṇa.
Droṇa was the last person to receive Dhanurveda from
Paraśurāma because the latter, surrendering his Dhanur-
veda in entire, left for the forests for doing penance.
Then, when did Karṇa learn Dhanurveda from Paraśu-
rāma? Could it be before Droṇa went to Paraśurāma?
Then it must be accepted that Droṇa had not studied
under Paraśurāma when he was teaching the
the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas. He learnt it from some-
where before he became the preceptor of the Pāṇḍavas.
Karṇa after studying under Droṇa for some time went
to Paraśurāma for higher studies and Droṇa approached
Paraśurāma after Karṇa had left him.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The destruction of the Kṣatriyas.%} The most important
event of his life was the total extermination of the
Kṣatriya race. The Purāṇic belief is that he went
round the world eighteen times to massacre the
Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>In many places in the Purāṇas it is stated that Paraśurāma
fought against the Kṣatriyas eighteen times. But in
chapter 29 of Aśvamedha Parva it is stated that Paraśu-
rāma fought against the Kṣatriyas twentyone times
So it is to be surmised that Paraśurāma fought eighteen
big battles and three minor ones.
<div n="NI"/>There are some old stories to explain this revengeful
enmity of Paraśurāma towards the Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Family enmity.%} The Hehaya dynasty was the most
powerful kingly race then. Paraśurāma was a descend-
ant of Bhṛgu, a brahmin sage. That is why he gets
the name Bhārgava also. The Bhārgavas were for gene-
rations the family preceptors of the Hehaya kings.
Taking advantage of their supreme position in the royal
palace the Bhārgavas accumulated great wealth at the
cost of the royal riches. Gradually the Bhārgavas rose
in prosperity in inverse proportion to the decline of
the Hehaya wealth. It was at the time of Ṛcīka, grand-
father of Parasurāma that they touched the rock-bottom
of their wealth and they found funds lacking even for
the day to day administration of the state. In despair
they went and requested the Ṛcīkas to lend them some
money. But they hid their money and refused to give
them anything. The Kṣatriya kings got angry and
killed the brahmins. What stock was left of them went
to the base of the Himālayas. The wife of Ṛcīka who
was pregnant then kept the child in her womb for twelve
years afraid to bring forth the child. After that the
[Page570-a+ 65]
child came out breaking open the thigh (ūru) and
so the child was called Aurva. Even at the time of his
birth Aurva shone like a brilliant torch and not only
that; the child cried aloud “Oh, wicked Kṣatriyas, I
will kill every one of you. I heard from my mother's
womb the din of the swords you raised to kill my
ancestors. I will never wait for another moment to wreak
vengeance on you.”
<div n="NI"/>The fire that emanated from the face of Aurva burnt
even Devaloka. Kṣatriyas as a class came and prostrated
before him. The devas came and requested him to
abandon his anger and Aurva agreed. The devas picked
up the fire sparks from Aurva's face and deposited
them in the ocean. From those sparks put in the ocean
was born Baḍavāgni alias Aurva.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Curse of the sage.%} From Aurva was born Jamadagni
and from Jamadagni was born Paraśurāma. In the
race of the Hehayas was born at that time a very valor-
ous king named Kārtavīryārjuna. Once Kārtavīryārjuna
gave a dinner to Agnibhagavān. Agni began to devour all
the mountains and forests in the world. The burning was
so indiscriminate that it burnt the āśrama of a sage
named Āpava also. The sage cursed Kārtavīryārjuna
saying that the thousand hands of the latter would be
cut off by Pasaśurāma born in the family of Bhārgavas.
From that day onwards the latent feud in him against
the Bhārgavas was roused into action.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Varuṇa's ridicule.%} Kārtavīryārjuna who got a thou-
sand hands by a boon from a sage named Dattātreya
subdued all enemies of his status and not satisfied
with that he went to the shores of the ocean and chall-
enged Varuṇa for a fight. Varuṇa came before him and
very modestly admitted that he was incapable of meet-
ing the challenge thrown and suggested that perhaps
Jamadagni's son, Paraśurāma might accept the chall-
enge and give him a fight. Hearing this Kārtavīryār-
juna turned towards the āsrama of Jamadagni on the
shores of the Narmadā river.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Causes of the war (immediate).%} Kārtavīryārjuna went
for hunting in the forests and feeling exhausted after
some time went to the āsrama of Jamadagni with his
retinue. Jamadagni received them well and with the
help of the Kāmadhenu (wish-yielding cow) named
Suśīlā, Jamadagni gave a sumptuous feast to the King
and his followers. When after the meals were over
they started to take leave of the sage, Candragupta, a
minister of Kārtavīryārjuna brought to the notice of the
king the superior powers of the Kāmadhenu, Suśīlā. The
king wanted to get the cow and asked Candragupta to
tell the sage about it. Though the minister told Jama-
dagni about the royal desire the sage refused to part
with the cow. Then the minister with the help of the
other royal servants took the cow by force and the sage
followed the cow weeping. On the way Candragupta
beat Jamadagni to death and brought the cow to the
presence of the king. The king was pleased and the royal
hunting party returned to the palace happy.
<div n="NI"/>Jamadagni's wife Reṇukā went in search of her hus-
band and to her grief found him lying dead. Reṇukā
wept beating her breast twentyone times and by that
time her son Para urāma came there and he declared
that he would travel round the world twentyone times,
the number of times his mother beat her breast, to kill
and exterminate the Kṣatriyas from this world. Then
the dead body of Jamadagni was placed on a pyre and
[Page570-b+ 65]
they were singing Viṣṇugītā before placing fire on the
pyre when Śukramuni appeared there and brought
Jamadagni to life by invoking the art of Mṛtasañjīvanī.
By that time Suśīlā somehow escaped from the custody
of the King and came there without the calf. Then
Paraśurāma vowed that he would bring the calf soon and
taking with him his disciple Akṛtavraṇa he left for the
city of Māhiṣmatī the abode of Kārtavīryārjuna. There
they fought a grim battle and after killing Kārtavīryār-
juna and many of his followers brought back the calf.
To atone for the sin of this massacre Jamadagni advised
his son to go and perform penance in Mahendragiri.
Taking advantage of the absence of Paraśurāma from
the āśrama, Śūrasena son of Kārtavīryārjuna, with his
followers went to the āśrama of Jamadagni and chop-
ped off his head. Paraśurāma returned from Mahend-
ragiri at once and cremated the dead body of his father.
Reṇukā, his mother, jumped into the funeral pyre
and abandoned her life. From that moment onwards
started Paraśurāma's fierce programme of mass mass-
acre of the Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Victory march.%} Paraśurāma's world-tour was con-
fined to an all-Bhārata tour. The wars of Paraśurāma
are not described in detail in the Purāṇas. They men-
tion thaṭ Paraśurāma killed the Kings of Cola, Cera
and Pauṇḍra. To stop the birth of Kṣatriyas in future
Paraśurāma destroyed even the embryo in the wombs
of Kṣatariya women. Then the Bhārgava ancestors like
Ṛcīka and others came to the sky and requested Paraśu-
rāma to stop this slaughter. They said: “Oh son,
Rāma, stop this slaughter. What good do you get by
killing innocent Kṣatriyas?” By that time Paraśurāma
had made twentyone rounds around Bhārata killing the
Kṣatriyas. (Chapter 64, Ādi Parva; Chapter 38, Sabhā
Parva; Chapter 116, Vana Parva; Chapter 49, Śānti
Parva and 10 chapters from chapter 83 of Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Samantapañcakanirmāṇa.%} Samantapañcaka is Kuru-
kṣetra itself where the great battle was conducted.
This is a holy place and it was Paraśurāma who
constructed it. He stored the blood of the Kṣatriyas he
killed in the twentyone rounds of killing in five lakes in
Samantapañcaka. He offered blood to the Manes in
those lakes. The Manes led by Ṛcīka appeared before
him and asked him to name any boon he wanted. Then
Paraśurāma said, “Revered Manes, if you are pleased
with me you must absolve me from the sin of this mass
massacre of the Kṣatriyas and declare the five lakes
where I have stored their blood as holy.” The Manes
declared, “Let it be so.” From then onwards the
place became holy under the name Samantapañcaka.
At the end of the Dvāparayuga and the beginning of
Kaliyuga a great battle lasting for eighteen days took
place at this holy place between the Pāṇḍavas and the
Kauravas. (Chapter 2, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Atonement.%} To atone for the sin of slaughtering even
innocent Kṣatriyas, Paraśurāma gave away all his
riches as gifts to brahmins. He invited all the brahmins
to Samantapañcaka and conducted a great Yāga there.
The chief Ṛtvik (officiating priest) of the Yāga was
the sage Kaśyapa and Paraśurāma gave all the lands
he conquered till that time to Kaśyapa. Then a plat-
form of gold ten yards long and nine yards wide was
made and Kaśyapa was installed there and worshipped.
After the worship was over according to the instructions
[Page571-a+ 65]
from Kaśyapa the gold platform was cut into pieces
and the gold pieces were offered to brahmins.
<div n="NI"/>When Kaśyapa got all the lands from Paraśurāma he
said thus:—“Oh Rāma, you have given me all your
land and it is not now proper for you to live in my
soil. You can go to the south and live somewhere on
the shores of the ocean there.” Paraśurāma walked
south and requested the ocean to give him some land to
live. Varuṇa then asked him to throw a winnow into
the ocean. There is a legend saying that it was a
Paraśu that Paraśurāma threw. Paraśurāma threw the
sieve (śūrpa) and the ocean gave way to land for a
distance where the winnow fell from where he stood.
This is the place Śūrpāraka now known as Kerala.
(Śūrpa = Winnowing basket). After giving this land
also to the brahmins, Paraśurāma went and started
doing penance at Mahendragiri. (Chapter 130, Ādi
Parva; Chapter 117, Vana Parva and Chapter 49,
Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other exploits of Paraśurāma.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Meets Śrī Rāma.%} Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
returning to Ayodhyā from Mithilāpurī after the
marriage along with the sage Vasiṣṭha through a deep
forest when Paraśurāma blocked their way and add-
ressing Śrī Rāma said thus, ‘Oh Rāma, son of Daśaratha,
I heard that you broke during the marriage of Sītā the
great Śaiva bow of the palace of Janaka. It was a
Śaiva bow and I have now come here to test your
prowess. I am giving you a Vaiṣṇava bow now. Can
you string this bow?”
<div n="NI"/>Vasiṣṭha tried his best to pacify Paraśurāma. But
Paraśurāma without heeding it started describing the
story and greatness of the Śaiva bow and the Vaiṣṇava
bow. (See under Vaiṣṇava bow). Then Śrī Rāma took
the bow from Paraśurāma and started to string it. The
brilliance of Śrī Rāma dazzled him and he stood
dumbfounded at his skill. Paraśurāma was immensely
pleased and he blessed Śrī Rāma. After that he went
again to Mahendragiri to perform penance.
<div n="NI"/>This same story is told in Kamba Rāmāyaṇa with
some slight changes:—Paraśurāma did not like Śrī
Rāma breaking the bow of his Guru Śiva. So an
angered Paraśurāma blocked the way of Śrī Rāma and
challenged him to string and take aim with the mighty
Vaiṣṇava bow he (Paraśurāma) was carrying with him
then. Śrī Rāma with perfect ease took the bow, strung
it, and taking the missile asked Paraśurāma to show the
target. Paraśurāma was astonished and was in a fix.
The missile could destroy even the entire Universe. So
Paraśurāma asked Rāma to aim at the accumulated
tapobala (power accrued by penance) of his self and
Rāma did so. Then Paraśurāma surrendered to Śrī
Rāma the Vaiṣṇava bow and arrow and the Vaiṣṇava
tejas (divine brilliance) in him. Paraśurāma after
having carried out the purpose of his incarnation gave
instructions to Śrī Rāma to continue the purpose of his
incarnation and then after blessing Śrī Rāma went
again to do penance at his holy āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>This same story is told by the sage Lomaśa to the
Pāṇḍavas during their exile in the forests. This story is
much different from the previous ones: “When the
fame that Śrī Rāma was the best of Kings spread far
and wide Paraśurāma once went to see Śrī Rāma.
Giving him the bow and arrow with which he had
done the mass massacre of the Kṣatriyas he challenged
[Page571-b+ 65]
him to string it and take aim. With a smile Śrī Rāma
did so and then Paraśurāma said Rāma should draw
the string up to his ears. Śrī Rāma got angry and then
on the face, which became fierce, by his anger, Paraśu-
rāma saw besides himself, Āditya-Vasu-Rudras, Sādh-
yas, Bālakhilyas, Devarṣis, oceans, mountains, the
Vedas and all such things of this universe. Śrī Rāma
sent out his missile from the bow. The whole universe
was thrown into chaos. Thunder and lightning rocked
the world. Heavy rains flooded the whole land space.
Burning stars and meteors fell to the ground. Paraśu-
rāma then knew that Śrī Rāma was the incarnation of
Mahāviṣṇu and he stood bowing before him. Ashamed
of his defeat he took leave of Śrī Rāma and went to
Mahendragiri. When he reached there he found he had
lost all his brilliance. Then the manes appeared and
advised him to go and bathe in the river Vadhū-
sarā. Accordingly Paraśurāma went and bathed in the
river and regained his lost brilliance. (Chapter 99,
Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Paraśurāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} The Purāṇas describe
two important occasions when Paraśurāma met Śrī
Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>The first meeting was at the mountain of Gomanta.
Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma with a view to enjoying
the abundance of Nature went to the beautiful
mountain of Gomanta and ascended to its top. On their
way they met Paraśurāma engaged in penance there. They
exchanged greetings and talked to each other for some
time. Then Paraśurāma requested Śrī Kṛṣṇa to kill
Śṛgālavāsudeva, King of Karavīra on the base of that
mountain. Śrī Kṛṣṇa promised to do so and left the
place carrying with him the blessings of the sage.
<div n="NI"/>The second meeting was when Kṛṣṇa was going to the
court of the Kauravas as a messenger of the Pāṇḍavas.
On his way Śrī Kṛṣṇa saw a company of sages coming
and, alighting from his chariot Kṛṣṇa talked with them.
Paraśurāma who was in that company then embraced
Kṛṣṇa and said that he should give a true picture of
the situation to the Kauravas when he was conducting
his mission. The sages blessed Kṛṣṇa and wished Kṛṣṇa
all success in his mission. (Chapter 83, Udyoga Parva;
10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Paraśurāma along with a few other sages was
present at the Sabhāpraveśa of Dharmaputra. (Śloka
11, Chapter 53, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Paraśurāma was present at the course of the
Kauravas when Śrī Kṛṣṇa was speaking to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas. When the Kauravas did not
reply the questions put by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Paraśurāma rose
up to tell a story to illustrate the evils resulting from
the arrogance of man. There was once a King called
Dambhodbhava who was very arrogant because of his
great strength. He wanted to diffuse his energy by
fighting and laboured much to get good opponents and
roamed about in search of fighters. One day the
brahmins directed him to Naranārāyaṇas and accord-
ingly Dambhodbhava went to their āśrama at
Badarikā and challenged them for a fight. They refused
to fight and yet the King showered arrows on them.
Then the sages took a few blades of the iṣīkā grass and
threw them at him. They filled the sky as great
missiles and the King begged to be pardoned and
prostrated before the sages. They sent back the be-
[Page572-a+ 65]
fooled King to his palace. (Chapter 96, Udyoga
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once a grim battle was waged between Paraśu-
rāma and Bhīṣma. (See under Ambā).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Paraśurāma sits in the court of Yama. (Śloka 19,
Chapter 8, Sabhā Parva).
