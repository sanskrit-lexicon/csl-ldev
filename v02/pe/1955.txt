DHARMASAKHA¦. A king of the Kekaya line of Kings.
<div n="lb"/>He had a hundred wives but no children. At last, at an
<div n="lb"/>old age, he got a son of Sucandrā, wife of his elder
<div n="lb"/>brother. But the hundred wives of Dharmasakha were
<div n="lb"/>pining for having a son and so the king consulted his
<div n="lb"/>ministers and on their advice conducted a Putrakāmeṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>yajña (a sacred sacrificial ceremony for obtaining chil-
<div n="lb"/>dren) at Hanūmatkuṇḍa near the southern sea-coast.
<div n="lb"/>As a result of that each of his hundred wives got a
<div n="lb"/>child. (Skanda Purāṇa, Chapter 15).
