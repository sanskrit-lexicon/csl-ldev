DHARMASAKHA¦. A king of the Kekaya line of Kings.
He had a hundred wives but no children. At last, at an
old age, he got a son of Sucandrā, wife of his elder
brother. But the hundred wives of Dharmasakha were
pining for having a son and so the king consulted his
ministers and on their advice conducted a Putrakāmeṣṭi
yajña (a sacred sacrificial ceremony for obtaining chil-
dren) at Hanūmatkuṇḍa near the southern sea-coast.
As a result of that each of his hundred wives got a
child. (Skanda Purāṇa, Chapter 15).
