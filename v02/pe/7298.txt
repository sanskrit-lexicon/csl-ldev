ŚUṢKA¦. A Maharṣi who lived in the Gokarṇa temple.
<div n="lb"/>When Bhagīratha brought Gaṅgā from heaven to the
<div n="lb"/>earth, sea water began to rise and the temples situated
<div n="lb"/>near the sea were submerged. At that time Śuṣka went
<div n="lb"/>along with other Maharṣis to visit Paraśurāma at the
<div n="lb"/>Mahendra mountain. In response to Śuṣka's prayer,
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma raised the submerged temples including the
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa temple, above the water.
