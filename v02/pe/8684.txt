<div n="lb"/>As the King led a libidinous life with this queen Bhadrā
<div n="lb"/>he met with an untimely death.
<div n="NI"/>When the King died, he had no children. Bhadrā cried
<div n="lb"/>for a long while embracing the dead body of the King.

<div n="lb"/>to her. “My love. Lie with me in your own bed on the
<div n="lb"/>eighth or fourteenth day of your menstruation. I will
<div n="lb"/>give you sons.” She acted according to the wish of the
