VYUṢITĀŚVA¦. A King of the Pūru dynasty, who was
righteous and just. He performed many sacrifices. His
wife was Bhadrā, daughter of King Kakṣīvān. It is said
that this Bhadrā was the most beautiful woman in India.
As the King led a libidinous life with this queen Bhadrā
he met with an untimely death.
<div n="NI"/>When the King died, he had no children. Bhadrā cried
for a long while embracing the dead body of the King.
Then the spirit of Vyuṣitāśva, without the body, said
to her. “My love. Lie with me in your own bed on the
eighth or fourteenth day of your menstruation. I will
give you sons.” She acted according to the wish of the
King and got seven sons from the dead body. Her sons
were three Satvas and the four Madras. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 120).
