KAPIÑJARA¦. (KAPIÑJALA). A bird. There is a
story about the origin of this bird in the Mahābhārata.
Once Tvaṣṭā created Triśiras to kill Indra. Triśiras had
three heads. When by one head he recited the Vedas by
another head he drank wine and by the third he looked
at the world wickedly. Indra envious of the growing
strength of Triśiras felled him down by his Vajrāyudha.
A person called Takṣaka carrying an axe came that
way then and by orders from Indra he cut off the heads
of Triśiras. When the heads fell down there emerged
from them birds called Kapiñjala, Tittiri and Kala-
piṅgala. From the head which recited the Vedas came
the birds Kapiñjalas; from the head that drank the
wine came the birds Kalapiṅgalas; and from the head
that looked at the world with wickedness came the
birds Tittiris. (Chapter 9, Udyoga Parva).
