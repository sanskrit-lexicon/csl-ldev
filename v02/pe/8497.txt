VIṢṆUDĀSA¦. A Vaiṣṇavite devotee who lived in ancient
<div n="lb"/>days. The story of this devotee who defeated his king
<div n="lb"/>Cola in devotion to Viṣṇu, is given in Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 110. The story is as follows.
<div n="NI"/>In days of old there was a king named Cola in Kāñcī-
<div n="lb"/>pura. It was because of his reign that the country got
<div n="lb"/>the name Cola. He had performed several sacrifices.
<div n="lb"/>On the banks of the river Tāmraparṇī, stood his golden
<div n="lb"/>Yūpas (pegs on which sacrificial animals were tied)
<div n="lb"/>that the place looked like Caitraratha.
<div n="NI"/>Once the king went to the temple and worshipped
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu by offering flowers of gold and jewels such as
<div n="lb"/>chalcedony and prostrated before Viṣṇu and rose up.
<div n="lb"/>At that time a Brahmin named Viṣṇudāsa from his own
<div n="lb"/>city came there to worship, with holy basil and water
<div n="lb"/>as offerings. He worshipped with the leaves and flower-
<div n="lb"/>bunches of holy basil. Because of his worship by holy
<div n="lb"/>basil, the king's worship by jewels, was dimmed. The
<div n="lb"/>emperor got angry and said, “Viṣṇudāsa, you are a poor
<div n="lb"/>man who does not know how to worship Viṣṇu. What
<div n="lb"/>merit has your worship of holy basil after mine of
<div n="lb"/>jewels?” Both began to contest on this point. At last the
<div n="lb"/>king said “Let us see who between us will get oneness
<div n="lb"/>with Viṣṇu first, you or I”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this the king went to his palace. He appoint-
<div n="lb"/>ed Mudgala the high priest and began to perform a
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice to Viṣṇu. The sacrifice was going on with
<div n="lb"/>pomp and festivities. Viṣṇudāsa also was immersed in
<div n="lb"/>devotion to Viṣṇu to the best of his abilities.
<div n="NI"/>Once Visṇudāsa, after his usual prayer and meditation
<div n="lb"/>prepared rice-food. But somebody took away the cook-
<div n="lb"/>ed rice unseen by Viṣṇudāsa. Fearing that he would
<div n="lb"/>miss the time for his evening prayer, he did not think
<div n="lb"/>of cooking food again. Next day also he cooked food
<div n="lb"/>and went for evening prayer. On that day also the rice
<div n="lb"/>was stolen. This continued. One day after cooking the
<div n="lb"/>food, Viṣṇudāsa waited close by in a hidden corner. He
<div n="lb"/>saw a low-caste man who was a mere skeleton because of
[Page867-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>famine, stealing the cooked rice and feeling pity on him
<div n="lb"/>he said, “Stop, stop. How can you eat it without any oily
<div n="lb"/>thing? See, take this ghee also.” Saying so he drew
<div n="lb"/>near. The out-caste was terrified at this and ran away.
<div n="lb"/>On the way he stumbled and fell. Viṣṇudāsa ran to
<div n="lb"/>the spot and fanned him with his cloth. When he rose
<div n="lb"/>up the figure in the place of the low-caste was that of
<div n="lb"/>the real Śrī Nārāyaṇa with conch, discus and club held
<div n="lb"/>in his hands. Because of devotion Viṣṇudāsa stood be-
<div n="lb"/>numbed. While the King Cola and the people were look-
<div n="lb"/>ing on, Viṣṇudāsa got into the divine Vimāna and went
<div n="lb"/>to the world of Viṣṇu.
