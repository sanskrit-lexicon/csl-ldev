INDROTA¦ (INDRODA). A sage, son of Śuka, the
great sage, and also called Śaunaka. Janamejaya, son
of King Parīkṣit once killed a brahmin, and at once
Brahmahatyā (sin of having killed a brahmin) seized
the King. The King lost all mental peace at this and
sought the advice of many sages for redemption from
the sin, and Indrota (Śaunaka) advised him to go on a
pilgrimage and perform righteous duties (dharma).
The King acted accordingly and got rid of the sin of
killing the brahmin. This story occurs under the title
Indrotapārikṣitīyam in Śānti Parva in three chapters.
(Chapters 150-152).
