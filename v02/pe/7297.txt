<div n="lb"/>cow used in connection with sacrificial offerings made in
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama of the sage Jamadagni.
<div n="NI"/>Jamadagni once got his wife Reṇukā killed by Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma. Though he brought her back to life as desired by
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma, Jamadagni felt deep sorrow for having got
<div n="lb"/>his wife killed. So, he went to Goloka and pleased
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi by his penance and she gave him Suśīlā, her
<div n="lb"/>sister. Jamadagni gave the cow (Suśīlā) to Reṇukā. It
<div n="lb"/>was this Suśīlā which later on Karttavīryajuna took away
[Page774-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>by force. (See under Jamadagni, Para 8). (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 61);
