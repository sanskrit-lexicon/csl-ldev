DEVAŚARMĀ V¦. A Brahmin, who used to perform rites
for the dead at the confluence of the sea every fortnight.
[Page213-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>On every such occasion souls of the departed used to ap-
pear and bless him. Once Devaśarman went to Pitṛloka
with his pitṛs, and he got restless and sorry to find other
pitṛs living there in greater comfort than the pitṛs of
his parents. When he was told that the better fate of
the other pitṛs was due to their sons performing Śrāddha
at Mahīsāgarasaṅgama he returned to earth and with the
help of other people did Śrāddha at the saṅgamaand
thus raised the condition of his pitṛs. (Skandha Purāṇa.
Skandhas 1, 2 and 3).
