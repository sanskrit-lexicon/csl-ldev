AGATI¦. A city. Two sons Takṣaka and Chattraketu
were born to Lakṣmaṇa (the brother of Śrī Rāma)
by his wife Urmilā. The court of the eldest prince
Takṣaka was situated in the city of Agati. Formerly
this place was known as Kanakhala and was occupied
by forest tribes. Exterminating these forest tribes,
Lakṣmaṇa built a city there and apportioned it to his
eldest son Takṣaka. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
