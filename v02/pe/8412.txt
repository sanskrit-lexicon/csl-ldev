VIRAJĀ¦. A cow-herdess. Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa duped Rādhā
and took the cowherdess Virajā to the region of love-
plays. A mischievous maid informed Rādhā of this.
Rādhā ran to the dancing garden and searched for the
couple. Śrī Kṛṣṇa had made himself invisible. So she
could not find him. She found out Virajā. Rādhā open-
ed her eyes wide and pretended that she was about to
curse her. Virajā was terrified and she melted and be-
came a river; full of anger Rādhā went home. (Devī-
Bhāgavata, Skandha 9).
