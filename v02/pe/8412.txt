VIRAJĀ¦. A cow-herdess. Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa duped Rādhā
<div n="lb"/>and took the cowherdess Virajā to the region of love-
<div n="lb"/>plays. A mischievous maid informed Rādhā of this.
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā ran to the dancing garden and searched for the
<div n="lb"/>couple. Śrī Kṛṣṇa had made himself invisible. So she
<div n="lb"/>could not find him. She found out Virajā. Rādhā open-
<div n="lb"/>ed her eyes wide and pretended that she was about to
<div n="lb"/>curse her. Virajā was terrified and she melted and be-
<div n="lb"/>came a river; full of anger Rādhā went home. (Devī-
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 9).
