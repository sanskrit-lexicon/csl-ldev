JALAPRALAYA¦. In all the Asiatic Purāṇas, reference
<div n="lb"/>to an ancient great flood, with slight changes occurs.
<div n="lb"/>According to Hindu Purāṇas this great flood took place
<div n="lb"/>before Mahāviṣṇu took the incarnation of Matsya. In
<div n="lb"/>the Holy Bible which is the scripture of the Christians,
<div n="lb"/>the story of the great flood is allied to the story of the
<div n="lb"/>Noah. (See under Avatāra). This story occurs in the
<div n="lb"/>Babylonian literature also. The book ‘Gilgamish’ which
<div n="lb"/>is as old as the Ṛgveda, is considered to be the oldest
<div n="lb"/>in the world. The theme of the Gilgamish is the travel
[Page339-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of a man named Gilgamish. This story is written in
<div n="lb"/>twelve clay-tablets. After 1850, the scientists of England
<div n="lb"/>who carried on an archaeological research, found in the
<div n="lb"/>library of Ancient Nineveh, the most famous in the
<div n="lb"/>ancient world, these twelve tablets along with twenty-
<div n="lb"/>thousand other tablets, all of which were in good condi-
<div n="lb"/>tion. This library was built by the King Aśurbānipāl
<div n="lb"/>in 7th century B.C., on a very high place on the bank
<div n="lb"/>of the river Tigris, in the ancient Nineveh.
<div n="NI"/>All these clay tablets have been removed to the British
<div n="lb"/>Museum. It took several decades to decipher them.
<div n="lb"/>When these clay tablets were discovered there was not a
<div n="lb"/>single man who could read and understand them, in
<div n="lb"/>the world. In spite of hard work, several years passed
<div n="lb"/>by without getting even a single tablet deciphered. They
<div n="lb"/>were written in ‘Accadean’, which was the language
<div n="lb"/>of the court of Aśurbānipāl and the national and the
<div n="lb"/>international language of the time. Another copy of
<div n="lb"/>this great work was discovered on the bank of the Eu-
<div n="lb"/>phrates, where the capital of the famous King Hāmu-
<div n="lb"/>rābi of Ancient Babylon stood. Later discoveries dis-
<div n="lb"/>closed that this great work Gilgamish was part and
<div n="lb"/>parcel of the famous ancient civilization of the Oriental
<div n="lb"/>countries. The Hittites and the Egyptians tried to trans-
<div n="lb"/>late this book Gilgāmish into their own languages. In
<div n="lb"/>the tablets with letters in the form of arrow heads, found
<div n="lb"/>on the bank of the Nile, the portions which were diffi-
<div n="lb"/>cult for them to translate, are given red marks.
<div n="NI"/>It was from a small piece of broken clay tablet that
<div n="lb"/>clues to the origin of this famous work were obtained.
<div n="lb"/>The world is indebted to the Sumerians, who had their
<div n="lb"/>capital in the place where the city Ur stands, for the
<div n="lb"/>original work of Gilgamish.
<div n="NI"/>Mention is made about a great flood in Gilgamish, as
<div n="lb"/>follows: Gilgamish set out on an adventurous journey to
<div n="lb"/>see his ancestor Utnāpiṣṭim to learn from him the means
<div n="lb"/>of obtaining eternal life. The gods had told this man
<div n="lb"/>about the secret of eternal life. At last Gilgamish reached
<div n="lb"/>an island and found out his ancestor and asked him
<div n="lb"/>about the secrets of eternal life. Utnāpiṣṭim said that
<div n="lb"/>he had lived in ‘Śhoorappak’ and that he had been an
<div n="lb"/>ardent devotee of ‘Iya’ God. When the gods decided
<div n="lb"/>to destroy mankind by a great flood the God Iya called
<div n="lb"/>his devotee Utnāpiṣṭim and said to him “You, man of
<div n="lb"/>Śhoorappak, the son of Ūrbārtūtū: Demolish your house
<div n="lb"/>and build a ship. Leave off your wealth and search for
<div n="lb"/>your life. Cast away your property and save your life.
<div n="lb"/>Bring the seeds of every living thing into the ship. The
<div n="lb"/>ship you build should be according to measurements.”
<div n="lb"/>The rest of the story is like the story of the “Ark of
<div n="lb"/>Noah”. The scientists are of opinion that in pre-historic
<div n="lb"/>times the three continents of Asia, Europe and Africa
<div n="lb"/>were one continent and that by earthquake or some
<div n="lb"/>other reason the south part of Europe had sunk down
<div n="lb"/>and water flowed in and thus the Mediterranean Sea
<div n="lb"/>came into existence. At a time when the far off regions
<div n="lb"/>of the earth were unknown, the people who escaped
<div n="lb"/>the flood imagined that the entire world had been sub-
<div n="lb"/>merged by the flood. It could be imagined that this
<div n="lb"/>story of the great flood passed on to posterity verbally
<div n="lb"/>and after so many generations it appeared in different
<div n="lb"/>regions in different languages in different forms.
<F>1) In writing about Jalapralaya. I have dealt with Gilgamish a little elaborately. Details on Gilgamish were obtained from the
<div n="lb"/>English translation of a famous German work by Venar Keller. This book had not been received when I wrote about the work ‘Gilgamish’.
<div n="lb"/>So these details are included under this word “Jalapralaya”.</F>
