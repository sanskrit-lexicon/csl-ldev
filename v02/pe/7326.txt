SUTĪKṢṆA¦. A hermit. While Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>were living in the forest with Sītā, they visited the hermi-
<div n="lb"/>of hermits such as Śarabhaṅga, Sutīkṣṇa and others.
<div n="lb"/>Once Indra came to the hermitage of Sutīkṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>invited him to the world of gods. It was at this time
<div n="lb"/>that Śrī Rāma came to the hermitage with Sītā and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa. When they were nearing the hermitage,
<div n="lb"/>Indra said “I shall see Rāma later when he has complet-
<div n="lb"/>ed his great task.” Saying thus Indra went away from
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage. Śrī Rāma and his wife and brother
[Page775-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>asked the hermit, where in the forest, they were to live.
<div n="lb"/>The hermit told them that they could live in that her-
<div n="lb"/>mitage itself.
<div n="NI"/>This hermit was the brother and disciple of Agastya.
<div n="lb"/>Once Sutīkṣṇa changed a wicked and cruel man
<div n="lb"/>named Duṣpaṇya to a good and righteous man by sprin-
<div n="lb"/>kling holy water of Gaṅgā on him. (See under Duṣ-
<div n="lb"/>paṇya). (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Sarga 7).
