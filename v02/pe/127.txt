AJĀMILA¦. Ajāmila's story is given in the Bhāgavata as
<div n="lb"/>an example to illustrate that even the most wicked person
<div n="lb"/>can attain Viṣṇupāda (Salvation).
<div n="NI"/>Ajāmila was a Brahmin who was once sent by his
<div n="lb"/>father to the jungle to fetch samit (leaves and twigs
<div n="lb"/>to make the sacrificial fire). Ajāmila met there a beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful Śūdra woman. Forgetting everything, the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>made her his wife and children were born to them.
<div n="lb"/>When that Brahmin, who was the very embodiment of
<div n="lb"/>all vices, reached the age of eighty-seven, the time came
<div n="lb"/>for him to die. Yamadūtas (Agents of Yama—the god
<div n="lb"/>of death) had arrived. The frightened Ajāmila shouted
<div n="lb"/>loudly the name of his eldest son, ‘Nārāyaṇa’. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>the repeated call of his name ‘Nārāyaṇa’, Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>appeared there and dismissed the agents of Yama. From
<div n="lb"/>that day Ajāmila became a devotee of Viṣṇu and did
<div n="lb"/>penance on the bank of the Ganges and after some years
<div n="lb"/>attained salvation. (Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1).
