AJĀMILA¦. Ajāmila's story is given in the Bhāgavata as
an example to illustrate that even the most wicked person
can attain Viṣṇupāda (Salvation).
<div n="NI"/>Ajāmila was a Brahmin who was once sent by his
father to the jungle to fetch samit (leaves and twigs
to make the sacrificial fire). Ajāmila met there a beauti-
ful Śūdra woman. Forgetting everything, the Brahmin
made her his wife and children were born to them.
When that Brahmin, who was the very embodiment of
all vices, reached the age of eighty-seven, the time came
for him to die. Yamadūtas (Agents of Yama—the god
of death) had arrived. The frightened Ajāmila shouted
loudly the name of his eldest son, ‘Nārāyaṇa’. Hearing
the repeated call of his name ‘Nārāyaṇa’, Mahāviṣṇu
appeared there and dismissed the agents of Yama. From
that day Ajāmila became a devotee of Viṣṇu and did
penance on the bank of the Ganges and after some years
attained salvation. (Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha,
Chapter 1).
