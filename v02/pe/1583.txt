CITRĀṄGADĀ III¦. Daughter of Viśvakarmā. Once
<div n="lb"/>while she was bathing in a pond along with her compa-
<div n="lb"/>nions in the forest of Naimiśa Prince Suratha, son of
<div n="lb"/>Sudeva, came that way. Seeing him Citrāṅgadā told her
<div n="lb"/>companions “This beautiful young man is in love. I
<div n="lb"/>must give myself to him”. Though her companions
<div n="lb"/>objected to her doing this, waving aside the objections
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgadā approached Suratha.
<div n="NI"/>When Viśvakarmā knew about this he was extremely
<div n="lb"/>angry and cursed her saying that she would never have
<div n="lb"/>a marriage. Citrāṅgadā fainted when she heard the
<div n="lb"/>curse and her companions tried their best to wake her
<div n="lb"/>up, but failed. They then took her to be dead and left
<div n="lb"/>the place in search of firewood and other things to
<div n="lb"/>conduct a funeral.
<div n="NI"/>When Citrāṅgadā woke up she looked around for her
<div n="lb"/>companions and finding none including her lover, the
<div n="lb"/>prince, she ran and threw herself into the river, Sarasvatī.
[Page186-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>That river pushed her down to river Gomatī and that
<div n="lb"/>river in turn washed her ashore a huge forest. There
<div n="lb"/>she was met by the sage Ṛtadhvaja. Knowing her
<div n="lb"/>sad tale the sage felt compassion for her and cursed
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā to be born as a monkey. Then he let her
<div n="lb"/>marry her lover and blessed them. (Chapters 63 and
<div n="lb"/>64, Vāmana Purāṇa).
