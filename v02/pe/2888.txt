JARĀSANDHA I¦. A terrible King of Magadha.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order:—Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa-Yayāti-Pūru-Janamejaya-Prācinvān-Pravīra-

<div n="lb"/>Cyavana-Kṛti-Vasu-Bṛhadratha-Jarāsandha.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Jarāsandha was created by joining together
<div n="lb"/>two halves of a child, by a giantess called Jarā, and so
<div n="lb"/>this child got the name Jarāsandha. (For detailed story
<div n="lb"/>see under Jarā).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The first battle with Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Asti and Prāpti, the
<div n="lb"/>two wives of Kaṃsa, were daughters of Jarāsandha.
<div n="lb"/>When Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa, the two daughters
<div n="lb"/>went to their father and shed tears before him. Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha became angry and with a mighty army sur-
<div n="lb"/>rounded the city of Mathurā. A fierce battle was
<div n="lb"/>fought between Jarāsandha and Kṛṣṇa. At last Bala-
<div n="lb"/>bhadrarāma caught hold of Jarāsandha and was
<div n="lb"/>about to kill him, when an ethereal voice said that
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadrarāma was not the person to kill Jarāsandha.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Rāma and Kṛṣṇa set Jarāsandha free.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) It is mentioned in Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, that
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha was the teacher too, of Kaṃsa.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Jarāsandha had four sons, Soma, Sahadeva, Tūrya
<div n="lb"/>and Srutāśru of whom Sahadeva became King of
<div n="lb"/>Magadha, after the death of Jarāsandha.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 185, that Jarāsandha had been present at the
<div n="lb"/>Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Once there arose a battle between Jarāsandha
<div n="lb"/>and Kaṛṇa, in which Jarāsandha was defeated and so
<div n="lb"/>he made a treaty with Karṇa. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5, Stanza 6).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The death of Jarāsandha.%} The enmity between Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Jarāsandha was life-long. These two mighty
<div n="lb"/>powers confronted each other eighteen times. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>decided to kill Jarāsandha, the King of Magadha,
<div n="lb"/>in a duel. Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa with Arjuna and Bhīma,
<div n="lb"/>reached the city of Magadha in the guise of Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas. They started from the kingdom of Kuru
[Page350-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>travelled through Kurujāṅgala and passed by
<div n="lb"/>Padmasaras and Kālakūṭa, visited the holy. places of
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍakī, Mahāśoṇā, Sadānīrā and such others, crossed
<div n="lb"/>the river Sarayū and reached the opposite bank. Then
<div n="lb"/>they travelled through the countries of East Kosala
<div n="lb"/>and Mithilā. Touring through the countries they
<div n="lb"/>crossed the rivers Carmaṇvatī, Gaṅgā and Śoṇa. Wear-
<div n="lb"/>ing matted hair and barks of trees they reached Giri-
<div n="lb"/>vraja, the capital city of Magadha. There were three
<div n="lb"/>big drums, which were used only on special occasions.
<div n="lb"/>The hide of elephant was used for making them.
<F>1. See under Bṛhadratha IV to know about the sound of this big drum.</F> Seeing
<div n="lb"/>all these sights they reached the presence of Jarāsandha,
<div n="lb"/>who welcomed them with necessary formalities and
<div n="lb"/>talked with them. But they kept silence. At last Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa told him that his two friends were having the
<div n="lb"/>vow of silence, which would terminate only at mid-
<div n="lb"/>night. So the King left them in the sacrificial hall and
<div n="lb"/>went to the palace. He came to them at midnight and
<div n="lb"/>asked them who they were. Śrī Kṛṣha revealed to him
<div n="lb"/>that they were Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna, who had
<div n="lb"/>come to fight a duel with Jarāsandha, who had unrea-
<div n="lb"/>sonably put many innocent Kings in dungeon, and
<div n="lb"/>challenged him to select any one of them for duel. Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha, trembling with fury, selected Bhīma. In that
<div n="lb"/>duel Jarāsandha was killed. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>3 Chapters from 20).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Names given to Jarāsandha.%} Bārhadratha, Māgadha,
<div n="lb"/>Magadhādhipa and Jarāputra are some of the names
<div n="lb"/>used in the Mahābhārata by Vyāsa as synonyms of
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha.
