GUṆANIDHI¦. A Purāṇic character who lived a sinful
<div n="lb"/>life and yet attained Svarga. In the country of Kosala
<div n="lb"/>there was once a noble brahmin named Girinātha who
<div n="lb"/>was rich, erudite and well-versed in the Vedas. Con-
<div n="lb"/>sidering his greatness people called him Girināthadīk-
<div n="lb"/>ṣita. Guṇanidhi was his son.
<div n="NI"/>When Guṇanidhi grew up he started his education
<div n="lb"/>under a preceptor called Sudhiṣṇa. Sudhiṣṇa had a
<div n="lb"/>wife named Muktāvalī. After some time Guṇanidhi
<div n="lb"/>started having clandestine relations with Muktāvalī.
<div n="lb"/>This developed so much that Guṇanidhi gave poison
<div n="lb"/>to his guru and killed him. His parents came to know
<div n="lb"/>of this and they came and reprimanded him. Evil-
<div n="lb"/>natured Guṇanidhi thought that the presence of his
<div n="lb"/>parents would be an annoyance to him in future. So
<div n="lb"/>Guṇanidhi and Muktāvalī planned together to kill his
<div n="lb"/>parents and one day they poisoned them.

<div n="NI"/>After some time Guṇanidhi and his wife lost all they
<div n="lb"/>had and gradually Guṇanidhi turned himself into a
<div n="lb"/>thief and drunkard. Nobody in the village liked the
<div n="lb"/>couple and all the villagers combined together and
<div n="lb"/>sent the couple away from the place. Guṇanidhi and
<div n="lb"/>Muktāvalī went to the forests and there they started a
<div n="lb"/>life of looting the travellers. After some years of a
<div n="lb"/>sinful life Guṇanidhi one day died lying beneath a
<div n="lb"/>Rudrākṣa tree. Servants of both Yama and Śiva came to
<div n="lb"/>claim the soul of Guṇanidhi. The servants of Yama said
<div n="lb"/>that the right place of Guṇanidhi the sinner, was in hell
<div n="lb"/>but the servants of Śiva said that even if he was a great
<div n="lb"/>sinner his place was in heaven because he died lying
<div n="lb"/>beneath a Rudrākṣa tree. In the end the Śivadūtas won
<div n="lb"/>and took Guṇanidhi to heaven.
<div n="NI"/>This story was once told by Śiva himself to demonstrate
<div n="lb"/>the glory of Rudrākṣa. (Skandha 11, Devī Bhāgavata)
