GUṆANIDHI¦. A Purāṇic character who lived a sinful
life and yet attained Svarga. In the country of Kosala
there was once a noble brahmin named Girinātha who
was rich, erudite and well-versed in the Vedas. Con-
sidering his greatness people called him Girināthadīk-
ṣita. Guṇanidhi was his son.
<div n="NI"/>When Guṇanidhi grew up he started his education
under a preceptor called Sudhiṣṇa. Sudhiṣṇa had a
wife named Muktāvalī. After some time Guṇanidhi
started having clandestine relations with Muktāvalī.
This developed so much that Guṇanidhi gave poison
to his guru and killed him. His parents came to know
of this and they came and reprimanded him. Evil-
natured Guṇanidhi thought that the presence of his
parents would be an annoyance to him in future. So
Guṇanidhi and Muktāvalī planned together to kill his
parents and one day they poisoned them.

<div n="NI"/>After some time Guṇanidhi and his wife lost all they
had and gradually Guṇanidhi turned himself into a
thief and drunkard. Nobody in the village liked the
couple and all the villagers combined together and
sent the couple away from the place. Guṇanidhi and
Muktāvalī went to the forests and there they started a
life of looting the travellers. After some years of a
sinful life Guṇanidhi one day died lying beneath a
Rudrākṣa tree. Servants of both Yama and Śiva came to
claim the soul of Guṇanidhi. The servants of Yama said
that the right place of Guṇanidhi the sinner, was in hell
but the servants of Śiva said that even if he was a great
sinner his place was in heaven because he died lying
beneath a Rudrākṣa tree. In the end the Śivadūtas won
and took Guṇanidhi to heaven.
<div n="NI"/>This story was once told by Śiva himself to demonstrate
the glory of Rudrākṣa. (Skandha 11, Devī Bhāgavata)
