DAMANAKA II¦. A daitya (asura) Mahāviṣṇu in his
incarnation as Matsya (Matsyāvatāra), killed this asura
who was a dweller of the sea. Viṣṇu threw the body of
the asura into the earth. By the touch of the Lord the
body became fragrant and it was changed to a plant
which is known as (Kozhunnu or Kozhuntu) Dama-
nakam. (Skanda Purāṇa).
