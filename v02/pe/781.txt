ĀSANA¦. Posture in Yogābhyāsa. There are different
types of āsanas. The chief of them are given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Bhujaṅgāsana.%} Lying flat, face downwards on a
sheet with hands placed close to the body on either
side. After relaxing all the muscles of the body, concen-
trate the mind on health. Keeping the feet close to-
gether and pressing the knees against the ground, raise
the soles upwards to the sky. Place both palms, pressing
against the ground, touching the shoulders on both
sides. Then raise the head and bend the neck back-
wards as far as possible. At this time, the trunk and
legs should be in close contact with the ground. Gra-
dually raise the chest, supported by the hands on the
ground. Bring the head down in the same way as it was
raised and restore the body to its former position. This
āsana strengthens the backbone.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śalabhāsana.%} Lie flat on the sheet, face downwards.
Keep the legs close together and raise the feet up with
the heels touching each other. Place the hands close
to the body on either side and close the fists upwards.
Place the fists and shoulders close to the ground and
make the whole body stiff after inhaling the breath.
Then try to raise the legs. Support the weight of the
body with the breast and hands. This is possible by
[Page093-a+ 65]
pressing the fists, firmly against the ground. Until the
āsana is completed, do not send out the breath. Keep
the legs straight and stiff. The lower abdomen and legs
may be raised slightly. This makes the āsana complete.
On feeling suffocation, the legs must be brought down
slowly.
<div n="NI"/>Besides these, there are many other āsanas like Dhanur-
āsana, Paścimātānāsana, Halāsana, Mayūrāsana,
Sarvāṅgāsana, Matsyāsana, Śīrṣāsana, Arddhamatsy-
endrāsana, Pādahastāsana, Trikoṇāsana, Uḍḍīyāsana,
Nauli, Viparītakaraṇi, Yogamudrā, Śavāsana, etc. (See
under Yoga).
