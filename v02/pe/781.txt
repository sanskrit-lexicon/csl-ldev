ĀSANA¦. Posture in Yogābhyāsa. There are different
<div n="lb"/>types of āsanas. The chief of them are given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Bhujaṅgāsana.%} Lying flat, face downwards on a
<div n="lb"/>sheet with hands placed close to the body on either
<div n="lb"/>side. After relaxing all the muscles of the body, concen-
<div n="lb"/>trate the mind on health. Keeping the feet close to-
<div n="lb"/>gether and pressing the knees against the ground, raise
<div n="lb"/>the soles upwards to the sky. Place both palms, pressing
<div n="lb"/>against the ground, touching the shoulders on both
<div n="lb"/>sides. Then raise the head and bend the neck back-
<div n="lb"/>wards as far as possible. At this time, the trunk and
<div n="lb"/>legs should be in close contact with the ground. Gra-
<div n="lb"/>dually raise the chest, supported by the hands on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. Bring the head down in the same way as it was
<div n="lb"/>raised and restore the body to its former position. This
<div n="lb"/>āsana strengthens the backbone.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śalabhāsana.%} Lie flat on the sheet, face downwards.
<div n="lb"/>Keep the legs close together and raise the feet up with
<div n="lb"/>the heels touching each other. Place the hands close
<div n="lb"/>to the body on either side and close the fists upwards.
<div n="lb"/>Place the fists and shoulders close to the ground and
<div n="lb"/>make the whole body stiff after inhaling the breath.
<div n="lb"/>Then try to raise the legs. Support the weight of the
<div n="lb"/>body with the breast and hands. This is possible by
[Page093-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>pressing the fists, firmly against the ground. Until the
<div n="lb"/>āsana is completed, do not send out the breath. Keep
<div n="lb"/>the legs straight and stiff. The lower abdomen and legs
<div n="lb"/>may be raised slightly. This makes the āsana complete.
<div n="lb"/>On feeling suffocation, the legs must be brought down
<div n="lb"/>slowly.
<div n="NI"/>Besides these, there are many other āsanas like Dhanur-
<div n="lb"/>āsana, Paścimātānāsana, Halāsana, Mayūrāsana,
<div n="lb"/>Sarvāṅgāsana, Matsyāsana, Śīrṣāsana, Arddhamatsy-
<div n="lb"/>endrāsana, Pādahastāsana, Trikoṇāsana, Uḍḍīyāsana,
<div n="lb"/>Nauli, Viparītakaraṇi, Yogamudrā, Śavāsana, etc. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Yoga).
