ŚAṆḌHĀMARKA¦. The two ṛṣis called Śaṇḍha and
Marka, who were priests of the asuras and whose
presence made them invincible. The Devas enticed the
two priests to their side by offering them Soma and
thus rendered the asuras powerless. When the Devas
after some time, began a yajña, Śaṇḍha and Marka
approached them for the promised Soma, but the Devas
did not keep their word, and the disillusioned Śaṇḍhamar-
kas were driven out of the yājñic hall. (Taittirīyasaṃ-
hitā, 6, 4, 10).
