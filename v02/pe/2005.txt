DHṚTAVARMĀ¦. The brother of Suvarmā, the king of
Trigarta, and Ketuvarmā. Arjuna led the sacrificial
horse of Aśvamedha performed by Yudhiṣṭhira after
the Bhārata war. Sūryavarmā the king of Trigartta, con-
fronted Arjuna and was defeated. Ketuvarmā who
came next was also killed. Dhṛtavarmā came next.
He showered arrows on Arjuna and inflicted wound on
his hand, and the famous bow, Gāṇḍīva fell from his
hand. Arjuna grew angry and fought so fiercely that
eighteen famous and mighty Trigartta warriors fell.
At last Dhṛtavarmā fell at the feet of Arjuna and
begged for pardon and accepted the supremacy of
Yudhiṣṭhira. (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 74).
