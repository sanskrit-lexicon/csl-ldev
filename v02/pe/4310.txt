<div n="lb"/>of Siṃhala. She determined to live an unmarried life
[Page477-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>but was forced by destiny to marry a cruel and un-
<div n="lb"/>charitable husband. The story of this Mandodarī as
<div n="lb"/>related to Devī by Mahiṣāsura is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Candrasena, King of Siṃhala, got of his wife Guṇavatī
<div n="lb"/>a very beautiful daughter named Mandodarī. Even
<div n="lb"/>when she was ten years old the King started searching
<div n="lb"/>for a suitable husband for her He found out Kambu-
<div n="lb"/>grīva son of Sudhanvā, King of Madradeśa and inform-
<div n="lb"/>ed his daughter about his desire to make him his
<div n="lb"/>son-in-law. But Mandodarī replied that she never intend-
<div n="lb"/>ed to marry and desired to spend her life worshipping
<div n="lb"/>God. Candrasena felt miserable at her reply.
<div n="NI"/>Years went by and Mandodarī became a blooming
<div n="lb"/>lady and yet she remained firm in her determination.
<div n="lb"/>One day she was playing in the royal gardens with her
<div n="lb"/>companions when the prince of Kosala, Vīrasena came
<div n="lb"/>that way by mistake. The extraordinary beauty of the
<div n="lb"/>princess attracted him and he māde a request to her
<div n="lb"/>through her companions to marry him. But Mandodarī
<div n="lb"/>refused.
<div n="NI"/>Time rolled on and soon the marriage of her younger
<div n="lb"/>sister Indumatī came. Candrasena invited all the neigh-
<div n="lb"/>bouring Kings for that. The King of Madra Cārudeṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was also present for the marriage. The King was very
<div n="lb"/>charming to look at but was very bad in character.
<div n="lb"/>Mandodarī was attracted by his external beauty and she
<div n="lb"/>expressed her willingness to marry him. Her father was
<div n="lb"/>immensely pleased and on the nearest auspicious day
<div n="lb"/>she was given in marriage to Cārudeṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Mandodarī went to the palace of Cārudeṣṇa and they
<div n="lb"/>lived happily for some time. One day she saw her
<div n="lb"/>husband having sexual acts with the wife of one of the
<div n="lb"/>palace servants. She reproached her husband and yet
<div n="lb"/>two days later she saw her husband with another
<div n="lb"/>servant girl. She was greatly disappointed and she
<div n="lb"/>left the palace for the forests where she started perform-
<div n="lb"/>ing penance.
