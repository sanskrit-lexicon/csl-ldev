of Siṃhala. She determined to live an unmarried life
[Page477-a+ 64]
but was forced by destiny to marry a cruel and un-
charitable husband. The story of this Mandodarī as
related to Devī by Mahiṣāsura is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Candrasena, King of Siṃhala, got of his wife Guṇavatī
a very beautiful daughter named Mandodarī. Even
when she was ten years old the King started searching
for a suitable husband for her He found out Kambu-
grīva son of Sudhanvā, King of Madradeśa and inform-
ed his daughter about his desire to make him his
son-in-law. But Mandodarī replied that she never intend-
ed to marry and desired to spend her life worshipping
God. Candrasena felt miserable at her reply.
<div n="NI"/>Years went by and Mandodarī became a blooming
lady and yet she remained firm in her determination.
One day she was playing in the royal gardens with her
companions when the prince of Kosala, Vīrasena came
that way by mistake. The extraordinary beauty of the
princess attracted him and he māde a request to her
through her companions to marry him. But Mandodarī
refused.
<div n="NI"/>Time rolled on and soon the marriage of her younger
sister Indumatī came. Candrasena invited all the neigh-
bouring Kings for that. The King of Madra Cārudeṣṇa
was also present for the marriage. The King was very
charming to look at but was very bad in character.
Mandodarī was attracted by his external beauty and she
expressed her willingness to marry him. Her father was
immensely pleased and on the nearest auspicious day
she was given in marriage to Cārudeṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Mandodarī went to the palace of Cārudeṣṇa and they
lived happily for some time. One day she saw her
husband having sexual acts with the wife of one of the
palace servants. She reproached her husband and yet
two days later she saw her husband with another
servant girl. She was greatly disappointed and she
left the palace for the forests where she started perform-
ing penance.
