ILLAKA¦. A person who led a very ideal family life.
<div n="lb"/>Son of a Vaiśya in the city of Mathurā, Illaka had a
<div n="lb"/>very beautiful wife. Illaka had one day to go to ano-
<div n="lb"/>ther place and his wife wanted to accompany him. But,
<div n="lb"/>Illaka did not allow that and went alone. Then she
<div n="lb"/>waited at the gates looking towards the husband moving
<div n="lb"/>fast away. And, when he completely disappeared from
<div n="lb"/>sight she, who could not bear the separation, fell down
<div n="lb"/>on the spot and expired. Illaka heard about the death
<div n="lb"/>and without delay, he hurried back home. He placed
<div n="lb"/>the dead body of his wife on his lap and wept. Weeping
<div n="lb"/>thus he also expired. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>baka, Taraṅga I).
