ŚŪRASENA I¦. A King of Yaduvaṃśa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Śūrasena's kingdom was Mathurāpurī.
<div n="lb"/>This country was originally ruled by Kings of the Solar
[Page768-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha explains how
<div n="lb"/>the Yādava Kings came to rule over Mathurā.
<div n="NI"/>There was a region called Madhuvanam in the Kālindī
<div n="lb"/>river valley. Madhu, the Asura, who lived in Madhu-
<div n="lb"/>vana had a son named Lavaṇa. Lavaṇa who was a
<div n="lb"/>tyrant and an oppressor of the gods, was killed by
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna who established his rule there. In course of
<div n="lb"/>time, the place came to be known as “Madhurā”. After
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna's time his two sons ruled over the country.
<div n="lb"/>Thus the Solar dynasty came to an end and Mathurā
<div n="lb"/>purī came under the rule of Yadus. The first King of
<div n="lb"/>Yaduvaṃśa was Śūrasena. Vasudeva, father of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa was the son of this Śūrasena. After the death of
<div n="lb"/>his father, since Vasudeva took up the occupation of
<div n="lb"/>tending cows, Ugrasena became King there. Kaṃsa was
<div n="lb"/>the son of this Ugrasena.
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Śūrasena's daughter Kuntī was adopted and brought
<div n="lb"/>up by the king named Kuntibhoja. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Refer Chapters 67, 109 and 110).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Devamīḍha, father of Śūrasena had another name,
