ŚŪRASENA I¦. A King of Yaduvaṃśa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Śūrasena's kingdom was Mathurāpurī.
This country was originally ruled by Kings of the Solar
[Page768-a+ 64]
dynasty. Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha explains how
the Yādava Kings came to rule over Mathurā.
<div n="NI"/>There was a region called Madhuvanam in the Kālindī
river valley. Madhu, the Asura, who lived in Madhu-
vana had a son named Lavaṇa. Lavaṇa who was a
tyrant and an oppressor of the gods, was killed by
Śatrughna who established his rule there. In course of
time, the place came to be known as “Madhurā”. After
Śatrughna's time his two sons ruled over the country.
Thus the Solar dynasty came to an end and Mathurā
purī came under the rule of Yadus. The first King of
Yaduvaṃśa was Śūrasena. Vasudeva, father of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa was the son of this Śūrasena. After the death of
his father, since Vasudeva took up the occupation of
tending cows, Ugrasena became King there. Kaṃsa was
the son of this Ugrasena.
