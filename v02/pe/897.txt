BALĀKA¦ (VALĀKA). A forester. This forester used to
<div n="lb"/>go for hunting and he gave everything he got to his old
<div n="lb"/>parents without reserving anything for himself. One
<div n="lb"/>day he did not find any animal even though he had
<div n="lb"/>made a thorough search in the forest. He was much
<div n="lb"/>worried. At last he reached the bank of a river. He
<div n="lb"/>saw an extraordinary animal drinking water. He had
<div n="lb"/>never seen such an animal before.
[Page101-b+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>It was a peculiar creature. That creature had done
<div n="lb"/>penance before Brahmā, from its young age with the view
<div n="lb"/>of destroying everything. Brahmā appeared before the
<div n="lb"/>creature and granted it the boon that it would have the
<div n="lb"/>power to make anything blind. Brahmā also said that
<div n="lb"/>anybody who killed the creature would be given a place
<div n="lb"/>in the realm of Gods. The creature had been wandering
<div n="lb"/>in the forest making blind every creature it met, and
<div n="lb"/>one day it was drinking water and it was then that
<div n="lb"/>Valāka shot it down. As soon as the creature fell down
<div n="lb"/>the gods showered flowers, and took him to the realm
<div n="lb"/>of Gods in a divine chariot. (M.B., Karṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 69).
