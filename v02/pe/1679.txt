DĀLBHYA¦ (BAKADĀLBHYA). A Maharṣi of Naimi-
<div n="lb"/>śāraṇya. In Vāmana Purāṇa, there is a story of how this
<div n="lb"/>sage once performed a homa and burnt Dhṛtarāṣṭra's
<div n="lb"/>kingdom in the sacrificial fire.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago some of the sages of Naimiśāraṇya approached
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra with a request for some money. Their
<div n="lb"/>leader was the sage Dālbhya (Baka). It was he who
<div n="lb"/>begged Dhṛtarāṣṭra for money. The king not only
<div n="lb"/>refused to give money, but also insulted the sage. Pro-
<div n="lb"/>voked at this, Dālbhya began performing a homa in
[Page195-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>which Dhṛtarāṣṭra's kingdom was the havis in the form
<div n="lb"/>of sliced meat. This homa was performed in Avakīrṇa-
<div n="lb"/>mahātīrtha at Pṛthūdaka. As a result of it the kingdom
<div n="lb"/>began to decline. The King was alarmed and consulted
<div n="lb"/>great scholars and astrologers about the cause of the
<div n="lb"/>country's decline. They told him that the cause of the
<div n="lb"/>disaster was Dālbhya's homa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra at once pro-
<div n="lb"/>ceeded with rich presents to propitiate Dālbhya at
<div n="lb"/>Avakīrṇamahātīrtha. Dālbhya was pleased and as
<div n="lb"/>desired by the King, performed homa with milk and
<div n="lb"/>honey and revived all those who had died. (Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 39).
<div n="NI"/>Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11 says
<div n="lb"/>that this Mahaṛṣi flourished in Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly.
<div n="lb"/>On another occasion, he is referred to, as coming to
<div n="lb"/>Dyumatsena, the father of Satyavān. At that time, he
<div n="lb"/>comforted Dyumatsena by saying that Satyavān would be
<div n="lb"/>blessed with longevity. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>298, Verse 17).
