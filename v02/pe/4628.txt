MURA I¦. A ferocious asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and acquisition of boons.%} Mura was the asura
born to Kaśyapaprajāpati of his wife Danu. Once
Mura was shocked to find the huge heap of dead bodies
of the asuras killed by the devas. Mura got afraid of
death and did penance for years to propitiate his
grandfather and Brahmā appeared before him and
asked him to name the boon he wanted. Mura said
“Lord, anybody whom I touch with my hands in a
battle, even if they are immortal, should die.” Brahmā
the father of the universe granted him the boon.
(Chapter 60, Vāmana Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family life.%} Mura became the guard of the
boundaries of Prāgjyotiṣa, the capital city of Narakā-
sura. Mura begot four thousand sons. Of these ten
were posted to guard the palace of the queens. Mura
performed penance and obtained boons. He fenced
the boundary of Prāgjyotiṣa with six thousand ropes
and arrested the approach of the enemies. These ropes
were known in Purāṇas as the Mauravapāśas. (Chapter
38, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Digvijaya.%} (Conquest of the quarters). Mura who
became arrogant by the power of the boons he possessed
went to Mahāmeru and challenged the Yakṣas and
Gandharvas to a fight. But none dared to fight with him.
Then he went to Amarāvatī and challenged Indra.
Indra also did not accept the challenge. Then he entered
Amarāvatī with a raised hand. Nobody stopped him.
Going to the palace of Indra he said “Oh, thousand-
[Page511-b+ 65]
eyed deva, fight with me or leave this place”. On hear-
ing it Indra left his place and came to earth. Then Mura
took possession of Airāvata and Vajra. He lived in
devaloka with Maya, Tāra and other dānavas enjoying
the luxuries there. Along with his wife, son and other
devas Devendra established himself on the southern bank
of Kālindī river.
<div n="NI"/>Then one day Murāsura came to the earth on the Airā-
vata and landed at a place on the banks of the river
Sarayū where Raghu a king of the solar dynasty was
conducting a yāga. Murāsura went to Raghu and said
“Come on, fight with me or you should stop this yāga.
You should not worship the devas.” Then the great and
brilliant Maitrāvaruṇi sage, Vasiṣṭha told him, “Daitya,
what use is there in conquering men of the earth? You
should win against those who are never defeated. If you
want to fight go and challenge Antaka, the god of Death.
Oh, King of asuras, that boy of an Antaka would never
obey your orders. If you conquer him you will have de-
feated all the world.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing the words of Vasiṣṭha, Mura started to fight
Dharmarāja. Yama on hearing that Mura was coming
to fight him went to Mahāviṣṇu on his buffalo as he knew
he could kill him. Mahāviṣṇu asked him to send Mura
to him. Yama returned to his place to see Mura there
ready to fight. Yama told him that he would do what-
ever Mura ordered him and then Mura said “You should
stop killing people or I will chop your head off.”
Dharmarāja replied “Mura, if you had been the person
who had appointed me for this job I would have will-
ingly followed your instructions. But I am under the
control of somebody else.” Mura asked “Who is the
person superior to you? Tell me, I shall surely defeat
him.” Yama said “There is an individual called Viṣṇu
holding a Cakra and a Gadā in his hands living in Śveta-
dvīpa. He is the person who has appointed me.” Mura
anxiously asked “Where is his abode? I shall go there
myself to conquer him.” Antaka replied “You go
to the ocean of Milk. It is there that Viṣṇu, the omni-
present protector of the universe is residing.” Mura said
“Well, I am going to him. But you should in the mean-
time discontinue your work of killing people.” Yama
replied “Go and win him. If you defeat him I shall
abide by your instructions.”
<div n="NI"/>Mura went to fight Mahāviṣṇu. It was at this time that
Śrī Kṛṣṇa the incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu attacked the
capital city of Narakāsura, Prāgjyotiṣa. Mura went to
the help of Narakāsura. The boundary of the city was
well-fenced with ropes but Kṛṣṇa cut them all and re-
moved the barrier. In the fight that ensued both
Narakāsura and Mura were killed by the celebrated
weapon Sudarśana of Kṛṣṇa. From then Kṛṣṇa
got the name of Muramathana. (10th Skandha,
Bhāgavata).
