MURA I¦. A ferocious asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and acquisition of boons.%} Mura was the asura
<div n="lb"/>born to Kaśyapaprajāpati of his wife Danu. Once
<div n="lb"/>Mura was shocked to find the huge heap of dead bodies
<div n="lb"/>of the asuras killed by the devas. Mura got afraid of
<div n="lb"/>death and did penance for years to propitiate his
<div n="lb"/>grandfather and Brahmā appeared before him and
<div n="lb"/>asked him to name the boon he wanted. Mura said
<div n="lb"/>“Lord, anybody whom I touch with my hands in a
<div n="lb"/>battle, even if they are immortal, should die.” Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>the father of the universe granted him the boon.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 60, Vāmana Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family life.%} Mura became the guard of the
<div n="lb"/>boundaries of Prāgjyotiṣa, the capital city of Narakā-
<div n="lb"/>sura. Mura begot four thousand sons. Of these ten
<div n="lb"/>were posted to guard the palace of the queens. Mura
<div n="lb"/>performed penance and obtained boons. He fenced
<div n="lb"/>the boundary of Prāgjyotiṣa with six thousand ropes
<div n="lb"/>and arrested the approach of the enemies. These ropes
<div n="lb"/>were known in Purāṇas as the Mauravapāśas. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>38, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Digvijaya.%} (Conquest of the quarters). Mura who
<div n="lb"/>became arrogant by the power of the boons he possessed
<div n="lb"/>went to Mahāmeru and challenged the Yakṣas and
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas to a fight. But none dared to fight with him.
<div n="lb"/>Then he went to Amarāvatī and challenged Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Indra also did not accept the challenge. Then he entered
<div n="lb"/>Amarāvatī with a raised hand. Nobody stopped him.
<div n="lb"/>Going to the palace of Indra he said “Oh, thousand-
[Page511-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>eyed deva, fight with me or leave this place”. On hear-
<div n="lb"/>ing it Indra left his place and came to earth. Then Mura
<div n="lb"/>took possession of Airāvata and Vajra. He lived in
<div n="lb"/>devaloka with Maya, Tāra and other dānavas enjoying
<div n="lb"/>the luxuries there. Along with his wife, son and other
<div n="lb"/>devas Devendra established himself on the southern bank
<div n="lb"/>of Kālindī river.
<div n="NI"/>Then one day Murāsura came to the earth on the Airā-
<div n="lb"/>vata and landed at a place on the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Sarayū where Raghu a king of the solar dynasty was
<div n="lb"/>conducting a yāga. Murāsura went to Raghu and said
<div n="lb"/>“Come on, fight with me or you should stop this yāga.
<div n="lb"/>You should not worship the devas.” Then the great and
<div n="lb"/>brilliant Maitrāvaruṇi sage, Vasiṣṭha told him, “Daitya,
<div n="lb"/>what use is there in conquering men of the earth? You
<div n="lb"/>should win against those who are never defeated. If you
<div n="lb"/>want to fight go and challenge Antaka, the god of Death.
<div n="lb"/>Oh, King of asuras, that boy of an Antaka would never
<div n="lb"/>obey your orders. If you conquer him you will have de-
<div n="lb"/>feated all the world.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing the words of Vasiṣṭha, Mura started to fight
<div n="lb"/>Dharmarāja. Yama on hearing that Mura was coming
<div n="lb"/>to fight him went to Mahāviṣṇu on his buffalo as he knew
<div n="lb"/>he could kill him. Mahāviṣṇu asked him to send Mura
<div n="lb"/>to him. Yama returned to his place to see Mura there
<div n="lb"/>ready to fight. Yama told him that he would do what-
<div n="lb"/>ever Mura ordered him and then Mura said “You should
<div n="lb"/>stop killing people or I will chop your head off.”
<div n="lb"/>Dharmarāja replied “Mura, if you had been the person
<div n="lb"/>who had appointed me for this job I would have will-
<div n="lb"/>ingly followed your instructions. But I am under the
<div n="lb"/>control of somebody else.” Mura asked “Who is the
<div n="lb"/>person superior to you? Tell me, I shall surely defeat
<div n="lb"/>him.” Yama said “There is an individual called Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>holding a Cakra and a Gadā in his hands living in Śveta-
<div n="lb"/>dvīpa. He is the person who has appointed me.” Mura
<div n="lb"/>anxiously asked “Where is his abode? I shall go there
<div n="lb"/>myself to conquer him.” Antaka replied “You go
<div n="lb"/>to the ocean of Milk. It is there that Viṣṇu, the omni-
<div n="lb"/>present protector of the universe is residing.” Mura said
<div n="lb"/>“Well, I am going to him. But you should in the mean-
<div n="lb"/>time discontinue your work of killing people.” Yama
<div n="lb"/>replied “Go and win him. If you defeat him I shall
<div n="lb"/>abide by your instructions.”
<div n="NI"/>Mura went to fight Mahāviṣṇu. It was at this time that
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa the incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu attacked the
<div n="lb"/>capital city of Narakāsura, Prāgjyotiṣa. Mura went to
<div n="lb"/>the help of Narakāsura. The boundary of the city was
<div n="lb"/>well-fenced with ropes but Kṛṣṇa cut them all and re-
<div n="lb"/>moved the barrier. In the fight that ensued both
<div n="lb"/>Narakāsura and Mura were killed by the celebrated
<div n="lb"/>weapon Sudarśana of Kṛṣṇa. From then Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>got the name of Muramathana. (10th Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
