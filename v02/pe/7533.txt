TEJASVATĪ I¦. A heroine in a story in Kathāsaritsāgara
intended to show that all happenings either good or bad
are but the workings of fate.
<div n="NI"/>Tejasvatī was the daughter of king Vikramasena of
Ujjayinī and was very beautiful. She never liked any
male and so never wished to marry. One day while
she was sitting upstairs in her palace, she happened to
see a young man passing that way and surprisingly was
attracted by him. She sent her companion to him and
informed him of her liking for him. He did not like the
idea first, but the clever persuasions of the maid made
him agree to a clandestine meeting with the princess at
a temple at night that day. Tejasvatī anxiously waited
for the night to come.
<div n="NI"/>About that time a Rajput prince greatly grieved at the
loss of his father and subsequent loss of his kingdom
started on a tour to see an old friend of his father. That
night, by sheer accident, he came and rested in the
same temple where the rendezvous of the princess was
fixed. When night fell the princess came to the temple
[Page788-a+ 65]
and without the least suspicion went and embraced the
solitary figure sitting in the temple. The prince did
not show any surprise and responded fully. The prin-
cess then understood all details of her lover and
took him to his father the next morning. Somadatta
(that was the prince's name) then told Vikramasena all
his mishaps and Vikramasena got back all the lost king-
dom of Somadatta and also gave his daughter in mar-
riage to him. (Taraṅga 4, Madana Mañcukālambaka,
Kathāsaritsāgara).
