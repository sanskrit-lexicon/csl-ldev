SUVARCAS¦ IX. Wife of sage Dadhīci. At the request
of Indra, the maharṣi sacrificed himself so that the former
might use his bones. Suvarcas who hated the Devas
especially Indra as the cause of her husband's death
cursed Indra that he and his dynasty be ruined. She
decided to end her life in the pyre of her husband when
the following celestial voice was heard: “You are
pregnant.” Then she opened her stomach with a sharp
stone, took out the foetus and placed it near a Banyan
tree and ended her life in her husband's pyre. (Padma
Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, 135; Śivaśataka, 24-25). The
child born from the foetus is the famous Pippalāda. (See
under Pirpalāda).
