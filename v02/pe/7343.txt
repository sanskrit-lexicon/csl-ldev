SUVARCAS¦ IX. Wife of sage Dadhīci. At the request
<div n="lb"/>of Indra, the maharṣi sacrificed himself so that the former
<div n="lb"/>might use his bones. Suvarcas who hated the Devas
<div n="lb"/>especially Indra as the cause of her husband's death
<div n="lb"/>cursed Indra that he and his dynasty be ruined. She
<div n="lb"/>decided to end her life in the pyre of her husband when
<div n="lb"/>the following celestial voice was heard: “You are
<div n="lb"/>pregnant.” Then she opened her stomach with a sharp
<div n="lb"/>stone, took out the foetus and placed it near a Banyan
<div n="lb"/>tree and ended her life in her husband's pyre. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, 135; Śivaśataka, 24-25). The
<div n="lb"/>child born from the foetus is the famous Pippalāda. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Pirpalāda).
