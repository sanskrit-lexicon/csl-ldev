JITAVATĪ¦. A daughter of King Uśīnara. She was the
most beautiful woman in the world. She was the friend
[Page358-b+ 64]
of the wife of a Vasu named Dyau. It was because of
the words of this Jitavatī that the Aṣṭavasus (the eight
Vasus) stole the cow Nandinī of Vasiṣṭha, and by the
curse of Vasiṣṭha had to take birth in the womb of
women on earth. (See under Gaṅgā, Para 7).
