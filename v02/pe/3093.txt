KĀLADVIJA¦. A serpent, which attained salvation. The
story of this nāga, which was at first a Śūdra is told in
chapter 16 of the Padma Purāṇa as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time there lived in Karavīrapura a very
selfish Śūdra called Kāladvija, who was sentenced by
Kāla to live in hell for four Manvantaras. After living
in hell the whole of the period, he was born as a nāga
and suffered much in the crevices of a stone. While
living thus, on an Āśvina pūrṇimā (Full moon day in
the month of Āśvina), it threw out some fried paddy
and Kauḍī (shells) which fell before Viṣṇu. At once the
Lord redeemed it from all its sins, and on its death,
in due course, the attendants of Viṣṇu took him in a
divine chariot to the Lord.
