KĀLADVIJA¦. A serpent, which attained salvation. The
<div n="lb"/>story of this nāga, which was at first a Śūdra is told in
<div n="lb"/>chapter 16 of the Padma Purāṇa as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time there lived in Karavīrapura a very
<div n="lb"/>selfish Śūdra called Kāladvija, who was sentenced by
<div n="lb"/>Kāla to live in hell for four Manvantaras. After living
<div n="lb"/>in hell the whole of the period, he was born as a nāga
<div n="lb"/>and suffered much in the crevices of a stone. While
<div n="lb"/>living thus, on an Āśvina pūrṇimā (Full moon day in
<div n="lb"/>the month of Āśvina), it threw out some fried paddy
<div n="lb"/>and Kauḍī (shells) which fell before Viṣṇu. At once the
<div n="lb"/>Lord redeemed it from all its sins, and on its death,
<div n="lb"/>in due course, the attendants of Viṣṇu took him in a
<div n="lb"/>divine chariot to the Lord.
