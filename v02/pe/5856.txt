RUŚAMĀ¦. A Priest who had studied the Vedas well.
A story occurs in the ‘Pañcaviṃśabrāhmaṇa’, about
this priest.
[Page658-b+ 65]
Once Indra and Ruśamā bet on going round the
world. Both got ready and started. But Ruśamā
walked round Kurukṣetra and returned, while Indra
travelled the whole of the way round the world and
kept the conditions. The question arose as to who won
the bet. The devas gave the decision, “Kurukṣetra is
the dais of Brahmā, and so Kurukṣetra contains the
entire world. Therefore both Indra and Ruśamā were
declared to have won the bet.”
