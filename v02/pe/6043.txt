SĀMBA I¦. The son born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa by his wife Jāṃba-
vatī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} A story about the birth of Sāmba, occurs in
Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Children were born to Rukmiṇī and the other wives of
Śrī Kṛṣṇa. But Jāmbavatī alone did not give birth to
children. Jāmbavatī was filled with sadness when she
saw the children of her co-wives. One day she went to
the presence of Kṛṣṇa and requested him to give her a
son like Pradyumna. Hearing this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to
the mountain where the hermit Upamanyu did
penance and making the hermit his teacher, according
to his advice, did penance before Paramaśiva. He did
penance for the period of a month holding a skull and
a hermit's rod. He did penance in the second month,
standing only on one leg and drinking water alone.
In the third month Kṛṣṇa did penance standing on the
toes using only air as food. When the penance was
continued for six months in this state, Paramaśiva
appeared as Sāmba (Ardhanārīśvara) and asked what
boon he wanted. Śrī Kṛṣṇa expressed his wish. Śiva
said that Jāmbavatī would get a son. Soon Jāmbavatī
gave birth to a son. The child was named Sāmba.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Sāmba married Lakṣaṇā the beautiful
daughter of Duryodhana. Hearing about the Svayaṃ-
vara marriage of Lakṣaṇā, Sāmba went to Hastināpura
and took her by force from among the various Kings
who were present there. Duryodhana and the others
captured him. This news reached Dvārakā through
[Page677-b+ 65]
Nārada. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma went to
Hastināpura and rescued Sāmba and took the bride
and the bridegroom to Dvārakā. Ten sons beginning
with Sumitra were born to Sāmba by his wife Lakṣaṇā.
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Prabhāvatī abducted.%} Prabhāvatī was the daughter
of Vrajanābha, the King of Supuranagarī. Sāmba,
with his brother Pradyumna entered the city Supura
in the guise of drama-actors with a view to kidnap the
beautiful daughter of Vrajanābha. They produced four
performances such as ‘Rambhābhisāra’ and three other
dramas and earned the praise of everybody in Supura.
In this way they got access to the palace of the King,
and when the time suited, they took away Prabhāvatī
to Dvārakā. (Harivaṃśa, 2: 93).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%The delivery of an iron rod.%} Once some Yādavas
with Sāmba at their head abused Kaśyapa and some
other hermits who came to Dvārakā. They cursed the
Yādavas, in consequence of which Sāmba gave birth
to an iron pestle, which caused the extermination of
the Yādavas. (See under Kṛṣṇa, Para 39, Sub Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The curse of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Sāmba was extremely hand-
some, and even the wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa fell in love with
him. Under the circumstances Sāmba tended to be-
come wicked. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to know of the unnatu-
ral attachment between his wives and Sāmba, from
Nārada and cursed Sāmba that he would become a
leper, and cursed his own wives, that they would be
carried away by thieves and plunderers. Accordingly
Sāmba became a leper and the wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa were
carried away by the Ābhīras, after the submerging of
Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>After a few years, according to the advice of Nārada,
Sāmba began to worship the Sun, at a place called
Sāmbapura in the basin of the river Candrabhāgā, to
get recovery from leprosy. A brahmin also was brought
from Śuka (Kuśa) island to perform the fast and vow cor-
rectly. (Sāmba 3; Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brāhma Parva, 66.
72; 73. 126; Skanda Purāṇa 4. 2. 48; 6. 213).
