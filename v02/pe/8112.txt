VASUDHĀRĀ¦. A holy place. Those who visit this
place could enjoy the fruits of performing horse-sacri-
fice. If one gives offering to the manes after getting
oneself purified by bathing in this holy tīrtha (bath),
one will attain the world of Viṣṇu. There is a lake of
the Aṣṭavasus (eight Vasus) in this place. By bathing
there, one could become the subject of the love and
regard of the eight Vasus. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
82, Stanza 63).
