ŚARABHAṄGA¦. A Maharṣi, who lived in the Daṇḍaka
<div n="lb"/>forest during the ‘forest-life’ of Śrī Rāma. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto IV). When Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma visited Śarabhaṅga's āśrama, Indra too came
<div n="lb"/>there, but went away saying that he would meet the
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi after the great mission of Rāma was over. The
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi told Rāma that he was waiting to see him and
<div n="lb"/>did not accompany Indra to Devaloka as he wanted to
<div n="lb"/>go there only after seeing Rāma. Rāma answered the
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi that he would take upon himself all the
<div n="lb"/>spiritual assets and good results of the actions of the
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi, and wanted him to point out a place for
<div n="lb"/>them (Rāma and others) to live. Śarabhaṅga directed
<div n="lb"/>them to the āśrama of Sutīkṣṇa, and after that ended
<div n="lb"/>his life by leaping into the fire and attained Brahmaloka.
