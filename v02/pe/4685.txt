NAIMIṢEYA¦. A sacred place. River Sarasvatī which
flowed westwards changed its course here towards the
east so that it (river) might see the sages of Naimi-
ṣāraṇya. There is a story about it in Mahābhārata as
follows:—
<div n="NI"/>The Yajña conducted by Śaunaka at Naimiṣāraṇya
ended in the twelfth year. The Ṛṣis who came from
various parts of the country were put up in āśramas
built on the banks of river Sarasvatī. But, many Ṛṣis
did not get accommodation there and they moved east-
wards. The River Sarasvatī which felt sorry that the
Ṛṣis could not be accommodated also turned and moved
eastwards, and thus afforded space for āśramas to be
built on her banks. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 37).
