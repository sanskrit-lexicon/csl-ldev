ATHARVĀ I¦. This muni is referred to in Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 50, as a professional
<div n="lb"/>chanter of Chandaveda. Once under the curse of Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi, Agni hid himself under the sea. (See “AGNI”).
<div n="lb"/>At that time, it was Atharvā who, at the suggestion of
<div n="lb"/>the Devas, went under the water and discovered Agni.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>Atharvā recovered Agni, and re-created the worlds
<div n="lb"/>which were lying dormant owing to the absence of fire.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>Atharvā was born from Brahmā's face. His wife was
<div n="lb"/>Śānti, the daughter of Kardama. Citti was another
<div n="lb"/>name for Śānti. But there are some Purāṇas which re-
<div n="lb"/>fer to Citti as another wife of Atharvā. Also, there are
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas which say that Atharvā was Aṅgiras himself.
