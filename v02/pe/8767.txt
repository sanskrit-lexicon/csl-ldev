YAYĀTI¦. An eminent king of the Lunar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1.) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} From Viṣṇu were descended
<div n="lb"/>in the following order—Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha
<div n="lb"/>-Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—Yayāti.
<div n="NI"/>Sage Atri had three sons—Candra, Durvāsas and Dattā-
<div n="lb"/>treya—by his wife Anasūyā. Candra's son was Budha,
<div n="lb"/>Budha's son was Purūravas, Purūravas's son was Āyus,
<div n="lb"/>Āyus's son was Nahuṣa who had six sons—Yati, Yayāti,
<div n="lb"/>Saṃyāti, Āyāti, Ayati and Dhruva. Yayāti had two
<div n="lb"/>wives, Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā. Two sons, Yadu and
<div n="lb"/>Turvasu, were born to Devayāni. Of them, Yadu became
<div n="lb"/>the founder of Yaduvaṃśa. Śarmiṣṭhā had three sons
<div n="lb"/>who were Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pūru. The Puru-
<div n="lb"/>vaṃśa traces its origin to Puru.
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Yayāti's marriage.%} Yayāti married Devayānī, the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of sage Śukra and Śarmiṣṭhā, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣaparvā.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story behind this marriage, given in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 76.
[Page896-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Once there was keen rivalry between Devas and Asuras.
<div n="lb"/>For achieving victory Devas accepted Bṛhaspati and
<div n="lb"/>Asuras accepted Śukra as their preceptors. Although
<div n="lb"/>Devas slaughtered all Asuras they were restored to life
<div n="lb"/>by Śukra by the power of his mantra. Devas and Asuras
<div n="lb"/>resumed their battle. “Mṛtasañjīvanī” (the art of revi-
<div n="lb"/>ving the dead) was then unknown to the gods. Devas
<div n="lb"/>sent the handsome youth Kaca to Śukra, to learn
<div n="lb"/>Mṛtasañjīvanī from him. There, Kaca fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī, Śukra's daughter. But after acquiring the
<div n="lb"/>knowledge about Mṛtasañjīvanī he returned, without
<div n="lb"/>marrying Devayānī. At the time of his departure, Kaca
<div n="lb"/>and Devayānī cursed each other. Devayānī's curse was
<div n="lb"/>that Kaca's newly acquired knowledge would not
<div n="lb"/>produce the desired result, while Kaca's curse was that
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī would not be married by any youthful ṛṣi.
<div n="NI"/>Śarmiṣṭhā was the daughter of Vṛṣaparvā, the Daitya
<div n="lb"/>king. Devayānī was the daughter of Śukra, the Daitya
<div n="lb"/>preceptor. One day they were enjoying a bath in a
<div n="lb"/>forest brook with their maids, after leaving their clothes
<div n="lb"/>on the bank of the stream. At that time Devendra who
<div n="lb"/>came that way, transformed himself into a strong wind
<div n="lb"/>and carried all the clothes to a place and put all of
<div n="lb"/>them in a heap. Seeing this, the women rushed out of
<div n="lb"/>the water and in the hurried confusion in snatching
<div n="lb"/>their garments Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā happened to
<div n="lb"/>put on each other's clothes. A quarrel took place bet-
<div n="lb"/>ween them on this mistake and the angry Śarmiṣṭhā
<div n="lb"/>pushed Devayānī into an unused well. Thinking that
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī was dead, Śarmiṣṭhā and her maids went to
<div n="lb"/>the palace.
<div n="NI"/>At this time, Yayāti who was a king of the lunar dynasty
<div n="lb"/>happened to come there exhausted after his hunting.
<div n="lb"/>After rescuing Devayānī from the well and enquiring
<div n="lb"/>about her identity and the circumstances in which she
<div n="lb"/>fell into the well, he returned to his palace
<div n="NI"/>Devayānī sent her maid Ghūrṇikā to her father and in-
<div n="lb"/>formed him about her mishap. The father, sage Śukra
<div n="lb"/>became angry towards Vṛṣaparvā, and came down from
<div n="lb"/>Daityaloka and settled down in the forest with his dau-
<div n="lb"/>ghter. Afraid of his preceptor's curse and anger, Vṛṣa-
<div n="lb"/>parvā came to Śukra and offered profuse apologies to him
<div n="lb"/>for his daughter's misconduct. But Śukra answered
<div n="lb"/>that he would be prepared to forgive only if Śarmiṣṭhā
<div n="lb"/>with 1000 maids would go and serve Devayānī. Finding
<div n="lb"/>no other way, Vṛṣaparvā yielded to the condition. Soon
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā and her 1000 maids went to the forest and
<div n="lb"/>began to serve Devayānī. Śukra returned to Daityaloka.
<div n="lb"/>Some time after this, Yayāti came to the forest one day
<div n="lb"/>for hunting. There he met Devayānī, being attended
<div n="lb"/>by many maids. In the conversation that followed, Deva-
<div n="lb"/>yānī was able to recognize Yayāti. She fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>him. But Yayāti insisted that he was not prepared to
<div n="lb"/>marry her without the consent of Śukrācārya. So she
<div n="lb"/>sent one of her maids to her father and informed him of
<div n="lb"/>her desire. The sage readily agreed and had their
<div n="lb"/>marriage performed. He also presented them 1,000
<div n="lb"/>maids. After the ceremony, Yayāti returned to his
<div n="lb"/>palace with his bride. Śarmiṣṭhā and the 2,000
<div n="lb"/>maids also accompanied them. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 76-81).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Yayāti's domestic Life.%} After his arrival in his capital
<div n="lb"/>city, Yayāti made arrangements for Devayānī's residence
<div n="lb"/>in his own palace while Śarmiṣṭhā took up her residence
[Page897-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in Aśokavanikā. In due course, Devayānī gave birth to
<div n="lb"/>a son. The sight of the child roused the motherly inst-
<div n="lb"/>incts of Śarmiṣṭhā who spent a thousand years in heart-
<div n="lb"/>burning. One day, while she was brooding alone in her
<div n="lb"/>garden, Yayāti happened to come there. As they met,
<div n="lb"/>their hearts were moved by tender feelings. Śarmiṣṭhā
<div n="lb"/>approached Yayāti and begged for a son. But he tried
<div n="lb"/>to evade her by pleading that it was not proper to do
<div n="lb"/>anything in violation of Dharma. But in the end, he
<div n="lb"/>had to yield to her earnest supplications and philosophical
<div n="lb"/>arguments. Thus Śarmiṣṭhā conceived a son in secret.
<div n="NI"/>When the child was born and it grew up, Devayānī's
<div n="lb"/>mind was constantly vexed with the thought as to who
<div n="lb"/>was the father. Once in an angry mood she questioned
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā herself about it. She answered that the
<div n="lb"/>child's father was a sage whose identity she could not
<div n="lb"/>ascertain in the excitement of her union with him. Any
<div n="lb"/>way, this answer satisfied Devayānī.
<div n="NI"/>Soon after, another son was born to Devayānī. The
<div n="lb"/>first boy was named Yadu and the second son, Turvasu.
<div n="lb"/>As a result of the secret relations between Yayāti and
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā, three boys were born to her and they were
<div n="lb"/>named Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pūru, respectively.
<div n="lb"/>These boys also grew up in Aśokavanikā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Devayānī was in her garden with her husband
<div n="lb"/>and children. Just then, Śarmiṣṭhā's children also
<div n="lb"/>happened to come there. Devayānī who somehow had
<div n="lb"/>her own suspicions, enquired of them their parentage
<div n="lb"/>and the innocent children replied that their mother was
<div n="lb"/>Śarmiṣṭhā and their father was Yayāti. Devayānī who
<div n="lb"/>became furious, immediately went to Asuraloka and
<div n="lb"/>informed her father Śukra about it. On hearing it, the
<div n="lb"/>sage who was beside himself with anger owing to his
<div n="lb"/>paternal affection, cursed Yayāti so that he fell a victim
<div n="lb"/>to the infirmities of old age. Yayāti entreated Śukra to
<div n="lb"/>withdraw the curse since he had not enjoyed his youth
<div n="lb"/>to the full.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra lifted the curse by assuring him that one of
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti's sons would accept his father's old age in ex-
<div n="lb"/>change for his youth and the son would be crowned
<div n="lb"/>King after Yayāti. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 82 and
<div n="lb"/>83).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rejuvenation.%} Yayāti asked his eldest son Yadu for
<div n="lb"/>his youthfulness. But the latter was not prepared to
<div n="lb"/>exchange it for his father's old age. Next the father
<div n="lb"/>approached his younger sons, Turvasu, Druhyu, and
<div n="lb"/>Anudruhyu, with the same request, but all of them
<div n="lb"/>in turn refused to oblige him. Even though Yayāti
<div n="lb"/>promised to return the youthfulness to them after a
<div n="lb"/>thousand years, they refused to exchange it for his old
<div n="lb"/>age. Yayāti in his anger, cursed Yadu that his progeny
<div n="lb"/>would never become Kings. Turvasu's family would be
<div n="lb"/>completely destroyed and Druhyu would float down the
<div n="lb"/>river, with unfulfilled desires and faded prosperity. Pūru
<div n="lb"/>wholeheartedly accepted his father's old age in exchange
<div n="lb"/>for his youth and went to the forest. From that day
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti began his reign with a cheerful heart. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi parva, Chapters 84 and 85).
<div n="NI"/>In Padma Purāṇa, there is a slightly different version
<div n="lb"/>about the way in which Yayāti fell a victim to the in-
<div n="lb"/>firmities of old age. It is as follows:—Seeing the rigorous
<div n="lb"/>observance of Yayāti's virtuous life, Devendra began to
<div n="lb"/>be alarmed at the thought that he might be dislodged
<div n="lb"/>from his place. He called his charioteer Mātali and
<div n="lb"/>ordered him to bring Yayāti with him to Indraloka.
[Page897-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>When Mātali failed in his mission, Devendra sent some
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas to enact the drama of “Vāmanāvatāra”
<div n="lb"/>before Yayāti. Enchanted by the charm and perform-
<div n="lb"/>ance of Rati on the stage, the King became irresistibly
<div n="lb"/>fascinated by the female sex.
<div n="NI"/>Once the Rākṣasī named Jarā and Madana got access
<div n="lb"/>to Yayāti's body. While in that state, one day he went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest for hunting. There he happened to meet
<div n="lb"/>a beautiful girl named “Aśrubindumatī”. From her
<div n="lb"/>companion-maid, Viśālā, the King came to know of her
<div n="lb"/>history. Viśālā said to Yayāti—“Long ago when Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>deva was burnt Rati was in deep grief. The gods were
<div n="lb"/>moved to pity by her tears and they restored Kāma to
<div n="lb"/>life. Rati who was extremely happy, began to shed
<div n="lb"/>tears of joy. A beautiful girl was born from the tears
<div n="lb"/>which fell from her left eye. This maid who is standing
<div n="lb"/>before you is that girl. She is now looking for a suitable
<div n="lb"/>person for her Svayaṃvara.” On hearing this story the
<div n="lb"/>King expressed his desire to marry her. Aśrubindumatī
<div n="lb"/>agreed to become his wife on condition that he exchang-
<div n="lb"/>ed his old age with some young person for his youth-
<div n="lb"/>fulness.
<div n="NI"/>Yayāti returned to his palace and asked each of his sons
<div n="lb"/>to give him his youth. Pūru alone fulfilled his father's
<div n="lb"/>desire. After this Yayāti married Aśrubindumatī. But he
<div n="lb"/>was compelled to submit to another condition also, that
<div n="lb"/>he should not maintain any contact with his other wives.
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā naturally, became distressed
<div n="lb"/>and furious when they saw Yayāti and Aśrubindumatī
<div n="lb"/>as husband and wife. So Yayāti asked Yadu to kill both
<div n="lb"/>of them. But Yadu refused to obey him. Yayāti who
<div n="lb"/>became angry at this, cursed his son that one of his
<div n="lb"/>descendants would marry his uncle's daughter and
<div n="lb"/>become heir to his mother's wealth.
<div n="NI"/>After some time, on Menakā's advice, Aśrubindumatī
<div n="lb"/>urged Yayāti to go on a visit to Heaven. So he entrust-
<div n="lb"/>ed his kingdom to Pūru and went to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Yayāti's reign.%} The Purāṇas describe Yayāti as a
<div n="lb"/>noble and eminent King. Some of the events which took
<div n="lb"/>place during his reign and which deserve special praise,
<div n="lb"/>are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Gift of cows.%} Once when King Yayāti was in the
<div n="lb"/>company of his subjects, a Brāhmaṇa approached him
<div n="lb"/>with a request for Gurudakṣiṇā. At once Yayāti gave
<div n="lb"/>him a gift of 1,000 cows. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>195).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Yayāti and Gālava.%} See para 6 under Gālava.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%His end.%} After a thousand years, Yayāti handed
<div n="lb"/>over his kingship to Pūru and went to the forest. He
<div n="lb"/>spent many years living in Bhṛgutuṅga in the company
<div n="lb"/>of sages, and feeding on fruits, roots, etc. and in the end
<div n="lb"/>died in the forest and attained Heaven.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Yayāti's fall from Heaven.%} Yayāti remained in Heaven
<div n="lb"/>for many years. Once he insulted the Devas, Indra and
<div n="lb"/>other gods and kings in the divine assembly. The gods
<div n="lb"/>looked at one another, wondering who this proud fellow
<div n="lb"/>was. They asked how this man reached Heaven without
<div n="lb"/>renouncing his pride. In the meantime Yayāti lost his
<div n="lb"/>balance and fell down from Heaven to the earth. While
<div n="lb"/>descending, he prayed that he should fall in the midst of
<div n="lb"/>good men.
<div n="NI"/>Just at this time, four kings named Pratardana, Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>manas, Śibi and Aṣṭaka were performing a Yāga in
<div n="lb"/>Naimiṣāraṇya. Yayāti happened to fall head down-
<div n="lb"/>wards into their midst. But since they caught him in
[Page898-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>his fall he did not crash to the ground. He explained
<div n="lb"/>his story to them. They allowed him to accept the
<div n="lb"/>fruit of their Yajña and to go to Heaven. But since he
<div n="lb"/>was a Kṣatriya he told them he had no right to it. Just
<div n="lb"/>then, his daughter Mādhavī arrived there. She allowed
<div n="lb"/>him to take half of the divine grace which she had earned
<div n="lb"/>and with the help of it Yayāti ascended to Heaven
<div n="lb"/>again. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 120).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Yayāti witnessed the battle between Kauravas and
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas which was fought as a result of the theft of
<div n="lb"/>King Virāṭa's cows. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 56,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) In Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse
<div n="lb"/>8, it is stated that King Yayāti continues to be in
<div n="lb"/>Yama's assembly.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Yayāti once gave 1,000 cows to a Brāhmaṇa as
<div n="lb"/>“Gurudakṣiṇā”. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 195).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) He came riding in Indra's chariot and witnessed
<div n="lb"/>the battle between Arjuna and Kṛpācārya, from the
<div n="lb"/>sky. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 56, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Mahābhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 115, men
<div n="lb"/>tions that Yayāti had conducted 1,000 Yāgas and that
<div n="lb"/>he was the leader of all Kings.
