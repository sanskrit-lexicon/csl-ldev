KṚTADYUTI¦. Queen of King Citraketu. Though the
King had many wives he had no children. He pleased
Aṅgiras by means of his austerities and due to the latter's
blessing Kṛtadyuti delivered a son. But, her co-wives
poisoned the child to death at which both Citraketu
and Kṛtadyuti fell down unconscious. Though Aṅgiras
and Nārada appeared on the scene and tried their best
to console the King and the queen they refused to be
comforted. Then Aṅgiras returned to them the soul of
the dead child. The soul saluted them and spoke as
follows:—“Oh elders, during various births I had been
the son of various parents. And, you please point out
to me the particular parent as whose son I am to live
just now.” Nobody had any answer to this question,
and the child went on its own way.
<div n="NI"/>Afterwards Citraketu and Kṛtadyuti went round the
earth as great devotees of the Almighty, and during
this perambulation Citraketu came to the presence of
Śiva on whose thigh Pārvatī was sitting then. Citraketu
[Page430-b+ 65]
felt ashamed at the sight and questioned Pārvatī about
her action whereupon she cursed and turned Citraketu
into an Asura. The well known Vṛtrāsura was Citra-
ketu thus reborn. Kṛtadyuti ended her life following the
curse upon her husband. (Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
