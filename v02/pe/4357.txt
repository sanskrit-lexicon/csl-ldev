MAṄKI I¦. A great sage. It was Bhīṣma, while he was
<div n="lb"/>lying on his bed of arrows who narrated the story of
<div n="lb"/>this sage. Maṅki was an aspirant of worldly things and
<div n="lb"/>once he got two bullocks. He was ploughing with them
<div n="lb"/>one day when a camel came and carried them away.
<div n="lb"/>Disappointed he came to the āśrama and lamented
<div n="lb"/>deeply over it. This lamentation became known later
<div n="lb"/>as the famous Maṅkigītā. By the time the gītā reached
<div n="lb"/>its end the mind of the sage was changed and he became
<div n="lb"/>one bereft of all worldly desires and he acquired
<div n="lb"/>mokṣa. (Chapter 177, Śānti Parva).
