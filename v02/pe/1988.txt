DHṚṢṬADYUMNA¦. The son of King Drupada. He was
brother of Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Drupada and Droṇa were fellow students. After
finishing his education Drupada became King. When
Droṇa came to his palace Drupada did not honour
him. Droṇa got angry, went to Hastināpura and began
to teach the Pāṇḍava and the Kaurava princes in
archery and other weapons. When the weapon-training
was over, Arjuna, at the instruction of Droṇa, defeated
and captured Drupada. Droṇa seized half of his king-
dom from him.
<div n="NI"/>As Drupada was not powerful to wreak vengeance on
Droṇa, he performed a sacrifice to obtain a son who
could take revenge on Droṇa and regain his lost
prestige. A son and a daughter were born from the
sacrificial fire. The son was named Dhṛṣṭadyumna.
The daughter grew up and became the famous Pāñcālī.
The Pāṇḍavas married her.
<div n="NI"/>At the time of birth, Dhṛṣṭadyumna had a crown on
his head, and armour on his body, bow, arrows and
sword in his hands. He ran out of the fire into a
chariot and sat in it as if he were about to begin a
travel of conquest. Seeing this the Pāñcālas were filled
with joy. There was a celestial voice: “This boy will
destroy the fear of the Pāñcālas. He is born to slay
Droṇa.” At this time the queen approached the sacri-
ficing priest with a request that the children born of the
sacrificial fire should consider her as their mother.
Accordingly the children accepted the wife of Drupada
as their mother. Brāhmaṇas named the boy Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna and the girl Kṛṣṇā.
<F>1. The fast taken on the eleventh day of the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Vaiśākha.</F>
<F>2. Because he was born with Dhṛṣṭatva (boldness) amarṣatva (impatience) and dyumna (vigour) the son of Drupada was
called Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Draupadī was called Kṛṣṇa as she was of Kṛṣṇa varṇa (dark complexion. Thus Drupada got two children from
‘Makha’ (sacrifice).</F> (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
166). (For more particulars see under ‘Pāñcālī’
Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Till the battle of Bhārata.%} The history of Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna till the battle between the Pāṇḍavas and the
Kauravas, is given below.
<div n="NI"/>The news that Dhṛṣṭadyumna was born to kill Droṇa
spread everywhere. The Broad-minded Droṇa did not
seem to mind this news. Droṇa took Dhṛṣṭadyumna to
his house, with the permission of Drupada and gave
him training in the wielding of weapons. He believed
that God's will could not be thwarted. After he had
learned archery Dhṛṣṭadyumna returned to his kingdom.
Next, we see Dhṛṣṭadyumna at the svayaṃvara
(marriage) of Pāñcāli. Several kings arrived from
various countries on that occasion. When the auspici-
ous moment came, Dhṛṣṭadyumna brought Pāñcālī to
the nuptial dais. He proclaimed the rules and condi-
tions that the competitors of Svayaṃvara had to
observe. After that he conversed with each king who
was present. In the Svayaṃvara Pāñcālī accepted
Arjuna. The Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālī were given the
Kumbhakāra mandira (the Palace of Kumbhakāra) which
stood in the city of Drupada, to stay for that night.
Though the Pāṇḍavas were in the guise of Brāhmaṇas,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna had his own doubts about their identity.
[Page234-b+ 61]
So he hid himself somewhere in the Palace and kept an
eye on them. This shows his peculiar trait of obser-
vation. After this he returned to his Palace and
pacified his father who had been much worried about
his daughter's selection.
<div n="NI"/>Next, we see Dhṛṣṭadyumna, during the time of the
forest life of the Pāṇḍavas. He consoled Pāñcālī, who
was miserable. After that he took the sons of Pāñcālī,
to his house. While the Pāṇḍavas were living in the
forest ‘Kāmyaka’, Dhṛṣṭadyumna visited them. The
forest life of the Pāṇḍavas came to an end. A battle
between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas became inevi-
table. Then the Pāṇdavas selected Dhṛṣṭadyumna, as
the commander-in-general of their army. He ordered
for a general parade of the army and gave them
instructions. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 166 to 195;
