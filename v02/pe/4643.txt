NĀBHĀGA¦. A brother of Ikṣvāku. The famous Ambarīṣa
was Nābhāga's son. After conquering all the worlds he
ruled the kingdom strictly along the path of truth and
righteousness. (Vana Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 12). In
the evening of his life Nābhāga gifted away the whole
land to Brahmins. Since she could not leave Nābhāga,
Bhūmidevī herself assumed physical form and went to
him on the occasion. This emperor never consumed
meat. He lives in Brahmaloka according to Chapter
115, Anuśāsana Parva. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 96,
Verse 124).
