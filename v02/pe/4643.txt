NĀBHĀGA¦. A brother of Ikṣvāku. The famous Ambarīṣa
<div n="lb"/>was Nābhāga's son. After conquering all the worlds he
<div n="lb"/>ruled the kingdom strictly along the path of truth and
<div n="lb"/>righteousness. (Vana Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 12). In
<div n="lb"/>the evening of his life Nābhāga gifted away the whole
<div n="lb"/>land to Brahmins. Since she could not leave Nābhāga,
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmidevī herself assumed physical form and went to
<div n="lb"/>him on the occasion. This emperor never consumed
<div n="lb"/>meat. He lives in Brahmaloka according to Chapter
<div n="lb"/>115, Anuśāsana Parva. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 96,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 124).
