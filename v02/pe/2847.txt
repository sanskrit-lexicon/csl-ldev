JAMBŪDVĪPA¦. One of the Purāṇically famous
<div n="lb"/>Saptadvīpas (seven continents). These seven continents
<div n="lb"/>are embankments separating the seven seas. Jambū-
<div n="lb"/>dvīpa, Krauñcadvīpa, Śākadvīpa and Puṣkaradvīpa are
<div n="lb"/>included in the seven islands.
<div n="NI"/>Jambūdvīpa has an area of one lakh of yojanas. The
<div n="lb"/>island is round like a lotus flower. There are eight
<div n="lb"/>long mountain ranges which divide the island into
<div n="lb"/>nine countries, which look like nine petals of the lotus
<div n="lb"/>flower. Each of these nine countries has an area of nine
<div n="lb"/>thousand yojanas. The two countries of the north and
<div n="lb"/>south extremities are bow-shaped. Four of the remain-
<div n="lb"/>ing seven are longer than the rest. The central country
<div n="lb"/>is square. This country is known as llāvṛtta, at the
<div n="lb"/>centre of which there is the mountain Sumeru with
<div n="lb"/>a height of one lakh of yojanas. This is called
<div n="lb"/>Svarṇaparvata (The mountain of gold). The top of
<div n="lb"/>this mountain is a great flat place with an area of
<div n="lb"/>thirtythousand yojanas. This great plain is ten thousand
<div n="lb"/>yojanas above the ground level. On the northern part
<div n="lb"/>of Ilāvṛtta lie the three mountain ranges of Nīlagiri,
[Page343-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Śvetagiri and Śṛṅgavān, and midway between them
<div n="lb"/>the three countries called Ramyaka, Hiraṇmaya and
<div n="lb"/>Kuru. On the southern part of llāvṛtta, there are the
<div n="lb"/>three mountains of Niṣadha, Hemakūṭa and Himālaya
<div n="lb"/>and three countries Harivarṣa, Kimpuruṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata. The mountain Mālyavān lies to the west and
<div n="lb"/>Gandhamādana to the east of llāvṛtta. There are two
<div n="lb"/>countries Ketumāla and Bhadrāśva having an area of
<div n="lb"/>two thousand yojanas each with the two mountains
<div n="lb"/>Nīla and Niṣadha as boundaries. At the foot of the
<div n="lb"/>mount Mahāmeru, there are the mountains of
<div n="lb"/>Mandara, Meru, Supārśvaka, Kumuda and many
<div n="lb"/>others. On those mountains big trees like ñāval
<div n="lb"/>(Syzygium jambolanum) Mākanda (Mango tree)
<div n="lb"/>Kaṭambu (Naucka Candamba) banyan etc. grow in
<div n="lb"/>plenty. On the top of these mountains there are four
<div n="lb"/>lakes, full of milk, honey, juice of sugarcane and sweet
<div n="lb"/>water. The devas become prosperous by the touch of
<div n="lb"/>the water of these lakes. Besides these parks there are
<div n="lb"/>four heavenly parks known as Nandana, Caitraratha,
<div n="lb"/>Vaibhrāja and Sarvabhadraka. The women folk of the
<div n="lb"/>devas (gods) and Gandharvas (demi-gods) play in
<div n="lb"/>these parks, which are convenient for couples to carry
<div n="lb"/>on lustful play. A river is formed there, by the juice
<div n="lb"/>oozing from the fallen mango fruits. The river is
<div n="lb"/>purple coloured and is called Aruṇānadī (river Aruṇā).
<div n="lb"/>The goddess named Aruṇā lives here. The famous
<div n="lb"/>Jambū tree is in this Jambūdvīpa. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 8).
