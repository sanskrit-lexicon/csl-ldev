KĪKAṬA¦ (M). The country ruled by King Kīkaṭa.
The following story is told in Devī Bhāgavata as to how
an ass in this kingdom attained heaven.
<div n="NI"/>There was once in Kīkaṭa a merchant who had an ass
to carry his merchandise. Once the merchant was
[Page411-b+ 63]
returning home from Bhadrācala with his ass loaded
with bundles of costly Rudrākṣas. The old ass fell down
dead on the way, the weight of the Rudrākṣa bundles
having been too much for it, and immediately it
assumed the form of Śiva and went to Kailāsa. Even
if a man does not know what he is carrying, if he
carries sacred things he will certainly attain salvation,
like the ass that attained salvation in this case. (Devī
Bhāgavata, 11th Skandha).
