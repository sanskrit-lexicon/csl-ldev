ŪRṆĀ¦. A wife of Marīci. In the Svāyambhuva Man-
vantara Marīci had a wife called Ūrṇā and six mighty
sons by her. When they saw Brahmā once, they teased
him by calling him ‘a father who had married his daugh-
ter.’ Brahmā got angry with them, and cursed them to
take birth as Daityas (demons) on the earth. Accord-
ingly they took birth as the sons of Kālanemi on earth.
(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
