MĀṆIKYAVĀCAKAR¦ (MĀṆIKKA-VĀŚAHAR). A de-
<div n="lb"/>votee and poet who lived in Tamilnāḍu. He is believed
<div n="lb"/>to have lived during the period between the eighth and
<div n="lb"/>ninth centuries A.D. He was born in Tiruvādavūr in
<div n="lb"/>an Ādiśaiva brahmin family. Tiruvādavūr was a village
<div n="lb"/>near Madura, the capital of Pāṇḍya kingdom. His
<div n="lb"/>father was Śambhupādāśrita and mother Śivajñānavatī.
<div n="lb"/>The name given by his parents to Māṇikyavācakar is
<div n="lb"/>still unknown. Because he was born in Tiruvādavūr
<div n="lb"/>everybody called him Tiruvādavūrār. He became a
<div n="lb"/>scholar in his sixteenth year. The Pāṇḍya king called
<div n="lb"/>him to his palace and appointed him as his minister.
<div n="lb"/>He gave him the honour of the title ‘Tennavar Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>rāyar’. Māṇikyavācakar showed more interest in devo-
<div n="lb"/>tional matters than in matters of the state.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the King was holding his durbar he got in-
<div n="lb"/>formation that in one of the eastern ports had landed a
<div n="lb"/>set of good war-horses for sale. He sent Tiruvādavūrār
<div n="lb"/>to that place. The minister, when near the port of
<div n="lb"/>Tirupperundurai, heard a sound of Vedic utterances and
<div n="lb"/>he immediately went to the place from where the sound
<div n="lb"/>came. He saw Lord Śiva sitting under a tree in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of a Guru. Forgetting all state affairs he became engross-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the meditation of Śiva. Suddenly he developed
<div n="lb"/>a talent for poetry and music and sweet attract-
<div n="lb"/>ive poems in praise of Śiva started flowing
<div n="lb"/>from his tongue. Śiva was immensely pleased and gave
<div n="lb"/>him the name Māṇikyavācakar meaning that every
<div n="lb"/>Vācaka (sentence) coming out of his tongue was equal
<div n="lb"/>in value to a māṇikya (Ruby). The guru gave him a
<div n="lb"/>ruby too. Māṇikyavācakar in the garb of a mendicant
<div n="lb"/>joined a troop of Śiva devotees and spent all the money
<div n="lb"/>he had for the service of the devotees of Śiva and also
<div n="lb"/>for the reconstruction of a dilapidated Śiva temple in
<div n="lb"/>Tirupperundurai.
<div n="NI"/>Māṇikyavācakar reached Madura and informed the
<div n="lb"/>King that the horses would arrive at the palace on the
<div n="lb"/>day Āvaṇi-mūla (Mūla star in the month of Śrāvaṇa)
<div n="lb"/>and presented the king with the ruby which his Guru
<div n="lb"/>had given him. The king was not satisfied and he im-
<div n="lb"/>prisoned him. On the Āvaṇi-mūla day at the stipulat-
<div n="lb"/>ed time the horses arrived at the palace. The horses
<div n="lb"/>were led by strange foreigners. It was Śrī Parameśvara
<div n="lb"/>himself who had come as the chief of the horsemen.
<div n="lb"/>Māṇikyavācakar was released from jail and he also came
<div n="lb"/>to see the horses. The King gave the leader of the troopers
<div n="lb"/>a silk shawl as present. The head of the troopers received
<div n="lb"/>it by the end of his whip. The King resented this but the
[Page479-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>troopers went back without any trouble. The horses
<div n="lb"/>were put in stables and Māṇikyavācakar went to his
<div n="lb"/>āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>At midnight all the new horses in the stables turned in-
<div n="lb"/>to jackals and roamed about in the streets howling
<div n="lb"/>loudly and disturbing everyone. After some time they
<div n="lb"/>all disappeared. The anger of the king knew no bounds.
<div n="lb"/>He imprisoned Māṇikyavācakar again. The servants
<div n="lb"/>of the king took him to river Vaigai. That day there
<div n="lb"/>was an unusual flood in the river and the city of
<div n="lb"/>Madura was submerged in waters. The king then realis-
<div n="lb"/>ed his mistake and begged pardon of Māṇikyavācakar.
<div n="lb"/>Māṇikyavācakar asked the king to repair the dam in
<div n="lb"/>the Vaigai. The king assented to the proposal but to
<div n="lb"/>save money the work was entrusted to the citizens of
<div n="lb"/>Madura.
<div n="NI"/>At that time there was an old woman in Madura called
<div n="lb"/>Vantī. She earned her livelihood by selling sweetmeats.
<div n="lb"/>The servants of the king ordered her also to join the
<div n="lb"/>work of the dam. She prayed to Paramaśiva and
<div n="lb"/>then a young man came to the old woman and offered
<div n="lb"/>to work for her in her stead. The young man representing
<div n="lb"/>Vantī went to Vaigai and started to work for her. When
<div n="lb"/>the king came to inspect the work he found the young
<div n="lb"/>man not doing his work satisfactorily and struck him
<div n="lb"/>on his back with a whip. A basketful of sand the young
<div n="lb"/>man was carrying fell down and the work of the dam
<div n="lb"/>was instantly completed. Not only that; all the persons
<div n="lb"/>including the king felt as though they were struck.
<div n="lb"/>Vantī attained Svarga and Māṇikyavācakar went to
<div n="lb"/>Cidambaram. The king repented.
<div n="NI"/>Māṇikyavācakar saw Śiva in person several times. Many
<div n="lb"/>wonderful events happened at the Cidambaram temple
<div n="lb"/>after the arrival of Māṇikyavācakar there. The King
<div n="lb"/>of Laṅkā hearing about the greatness of Māṇikyavācakar
<div n="lb"/>brought his dumb daughter to him and she gained the
<div n="lb"/>power of speech. The Buddhist saints of Laṅkā came
<div n="lb"/>to Māṇikyavācakar and entered into philosophical
<div n="lb"/>discourse with him. They became dumb. The king of
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā and his followers became devotees of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Māṇikyavācakar sat in his āśrama and composed divine
<div n="lb"/>songs. Once Śiva in the guise of a brahmin came there
<div n="lb"/>and copied the songs written by him. Even while he
<div n="lb"/>was reciting his divine songs to the devotees his soul
<div n="lb"/>left his body and merged with that of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>The divine songs in praise of Śiva by Māṇikyavācakar
<div n="lb"/>constitute the eighth Khaṇḍa of Śaivite hymns by name
<div n="lb"/>“Tirumurai”. They include “Tiruvācakam” and
<div n="lb"/>“Tirukkovaiyār”. The Tiruvācakam contains 654 verses
<div n="lb"/>in 51 hymns and the Tirukkovaiyār contains 400 verses.
<div n="lb"/>All these are songs in praise of Śiva sung on different
<div n="lb"/>occasions. (Divyacaritam).
