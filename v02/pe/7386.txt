ŚVAPHALKA¦. Father of Akrūra. Vṛṣṇi, a Yādava King
<div n="lb"/>had two sons Śvaphalka and Citraka. It was divinely
<div n="lb"/>ordained that there would not be epidemics and drought
<div n="lb"/>in the place where Śvaphalka lived. Once there was no
<div n="lb"/>rain for a period of three years in the land of the King
<div n="lb"/>of Kāśī. So the King of Kāśī took Śvaphalka with him
<div n="lb"/>to his country. With his arrival there was rainfall in
<div n="lb"/>the land and the King who was pleased at it gave his
<div n="lb"/>daughter Gāndinī in marriage to Śvaphalka.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the birth of Gāndinī also.
<div n="lb"/>Gāndinī remained in her mother's womb for many
<div n="lb"/>years. At last the King of Kāśī called to the child
<div n="lb"/>in the womb and said, “Take birth at once; why do
<div n="lb"/>you remain there so long?” The child replied, “I shall
<div n="lb"/>come out if you allow me to offer a cow as gift every
<div n="lb"/>day.” The King allowed it and the child was born.
<div n="lb"/>She was named “Gāndinī.” She used to offer the gift of
<div n="lb"/>cows to Brāhmaṇas daily. After she married Śvaphalka,
<div n="lb"/>several sons including Akrūra were born to her,
<div n="lb"/>(Harivaṃśa, Chapter 34, Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
