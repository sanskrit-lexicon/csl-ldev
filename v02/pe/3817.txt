KUMBHĪPĀKA¦ (M). One of the twentyeight narakas
(hells). It is intended for the cruel folk, who kill for
food harmless animals and birds. Since such cruel folk
are roasted in Kumbhī fire the hell came to be known
by this name. Big vessels full of boiling oil are kept
there and the servants of Yama push the sinners into
them. One who had killed an animal will be kept in
the boiling oil for as many years as the number of hairs
the animal killed by him had on its body. (Devī
Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha; also see under Pitṛtīrtha).
