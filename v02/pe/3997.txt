LIPI¦ (ALPHABET, SCRIPT).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Lipi is the record in writing of the utteran-
ces by mouth. There are scientific and non-scientific
statements about the origin of lipi. In the beginning
people used figures of objects to express their ideas.
They were called pictorial writings and are found even
now in caves in Spain and France where the aborigines
lived. Gradually the pictures vanished and letters took
their place.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ancient conception.%} Purāṇas give a different ver-
sion. People of Java believe that the script origi-
nated from Java. The voice of Indonesia, a government
organ, published once a purāṇic story relating to the
origin of the script. Lipi came into being in 78 A.D.
Ajaśikha, a saint among the Buddhists, was the originator
of the lipi. He had two disciples named Dora and
Sempādā. All the three went and stayed in a village in
the valley of the mountains of Konṭaṅg. The country
of Menrāṅgkāmanāl was then ruled by a King called
Baka. Ajaśikha heard about this wicked King who had
ordered one of his subjects to go to him daily for his
food. The people were worried. They tried in secret to
find out someone to subdue this tyrant. One day they
approached Ajaśikha and requested him to find out a
way to get relief from this cruel King. Ajaśikha sent
them back promising to do something to help them.
<div n="NI"/>Ajaśikha sat in meditation for some time and then told
his disciples thus:— “I have decided to help the people
of Menrāṅgkāmanāl. Dora also should come with me.
Sempādā should stay here keeping guard over my
sword and clothes. Never give them to anybody but
me. You should be prepared to give your life for it.”
<div n="NI"/>Ajaśikha and Dora went to see Baka. People discourag-
ed them and advised them not to go to the King. But
they did not heed that and straight away went to the
presence of Baka. Baka started to kill them but then
Ajaśikha said, “Oh King, you can eat me tomorrow.
In return please give me today land as big as my
headwear”. Baka agreed to that and Ajaśikha spread
his clothes on the ground. As Baka looked with wonder
that small piece of headwear began to grow big and it
grew in size to cover the whole of the country.
Baka got furious at this and attacked Ajaśikha. But
Baka was slain in the duel.
<div n="NI"/>The people burst into joy and made Ajaśikha their
King. Ajaśikha then sent Dora to his āśrama to fetch
his sword and apparels, little thinking of the instructions
he had given to Sempādā. Dora went and asked for the
sword and apparel. But Sempādā did not give and a
fight ensued in which both were killed.
<div n="NI"/>Ajaśikha felt very sorry when he heard about the death
of his disciples. He cursed himself for giving contra-
dictory orders to his disciples and so wrote four lines,
each containing five letters, to keep alive the memory
of his dutiful disciples. Those twenty letters are the
first ones written not only in Java but the whole world.
They were the following:
<div n="NI"/>He no co ro ko—There were two disciples.
<div n="NI"/>Ṭo to so vo lo—They became enemies because they
obeyed the orders of their guru.
<div n="NI"/>Po dho jo yo ñjo—Both of them were brave men.
<div n="NI"/>Mo go bo do ṅgo—Both of them died.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhārata lipis.%} Different kinds of lipis were prevalent
in ancient Bhārata. Lalitavistara mentions about sixty-
[Page454-b+ 65]
four kinds of lipis in Bhārata during the time of Buddha.
From inscriptions on stones and other historical records
it can be gathered that the basis of all the lipis had been
two main lipis named Brāhmī and Kharoṣṭrī. Kharoṣṭrī
was used in the northwest of Bhārata and became extinct
by the 4th Century A.D. Brāhmī was the lipi universally
used in Bhārata. This lipi had different forms in the
north and south. The lipi in use in the south was called
Drāviḍī.
<div n="NI"/>Kharoṣtī lipi was written from right to left and the
Brāhmī from left to right. Even the Brāhmī was written
first from right to left and gradually for the convenience
of writing it was changed to one from left to right.
<div n="NI"/>Linguists consider Brāhmī lipi as the base of all the
lipis of Bhārata. It underwent changes in different
parts and took different names. The scholars of Europe
are of opinion that the Brāhmī lipi was borrowed from
foreign traders in B.C. 800. Others say that the Brāhmī
lipi was born out of the pictorial lipi of the Chinese.
There are those who say that the Brāhmī lipi originated
in Greece and Phoenicia. The great linguist Bulhar
says that the Brāhmī lipi came from the Semitic
languages. But Lassen and Cunningham refuted it.
<div n="NI"/>There is a bundle of leaves in the hand of the idol of
Brahmā in the temple of Bādāmi. Hindus believe that
the Brāhmī lipi found in those leaves was written by
Brahmā himself. The Aryans forgot that lipi and Vyāsa
found it out. This is a statement by the Arab traveller
Albarūni who came to India in the 11th century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kerala Lipi.%} The Brāhmī lipi came to south India
by the 3rd century A.D. Many scholars on languages
say that ‘Veṭṭeluttu’ is a changed form of the Brāhmī
lipi. The great lipi expert L.A. Ravi Varma says that
‘Eluttu’ has come from the word ‘Elu’ or ‘Alu’ meaning
‘to mark by cuts’. The common method of writing in
South India was to use a pointed stick, long metal nail
or chisel to make marks on leaves, rocks or copper
plates. Writing by making marks with the pointed
stick (Kol) got the name ‘Koleluttu’. Veṭṭeluttu,
Koleluttu and Malayāṇma were the three lipis in use
in Kerala. Veṭṭeluttu was in vogue in Tamilnāḍu also.
But the Pallavas who were using Prākṛta language when
they conquered the northern Tamilnad introduced
Granthākṣara and Granthatamil there. T.K.Krishna
Menon says that Granthākṣara was a false creation to
write Sanskrit easily. In Pāṇḍyadeśa and Malanāḍu
Veṭṭeluttu was in use even then.
<div n="NI"/>The influence of the Pallavas began to wane and the
Tamil lipi slowly rose into prominence. Even then
Veṭṭeluttu was in vogue in the empire of Cera com-
prising of Malanāḍu, Mysore. Coimbatore, Salem and
Toṇḍamaṇḍalam. When Tamilnadu came under the
emperor of Vijayanagara those kings introduced Nāgarī
lipi there.
<div n="NI"/>Veṭṭeluttu was called Nānam Monam also. In the south
instead of using ‘Hari Śrī’ people used to say ‘Namo-
nārāyaṇāya’ and the first syllable ‘Na’ and the second
one ‘Mo’ were used to name the language ‘Nānam
Monam’.
<div n="NI"/>When the Malayālis started liking the Maṇipravāla
they started using ‘Ārya eluttu’ a form of Granthalipi.
This script was known as Tulu-Malayālam also. This
was also born of the Brāhmīlipi. Gradually Veṭṭeluttu
and Koleluttu was in use in the north of Kerala among
Muslims. The Alphabets now in use by the different
[Page455-a+ 65]
languages of south India took shape only about two
centuries ago. The lipi of Malayālam now in use came
into shape by the time of Eluttaśśan spreading the
belief that it was Eluttaśśan who had made the
alphabet. It is wise to believe that the Malayālam
script came into use gradually from Ārya eluttu than to
give credit to one individual for its origin.
