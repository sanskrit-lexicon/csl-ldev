DEVARĀJA II¦. An immoral brahmin who had been a
trader in Kirātanagara. Once he met a whore at the
bathing pool and got so inextricably tied up with her
that he killed his parents and wife for her sake. Then
one day he had to go to Pratiṣṭhānanagara on business
where he heard sacred stories being read. He had also
a glimpse of the divine. A month after that he died.
Though an evil fellow, because of his having worshipped
Śiva for a month he had the good fortune to go to Mount
Kailāsa after his death. (Śiva Purāṇa Māhātmyam).
