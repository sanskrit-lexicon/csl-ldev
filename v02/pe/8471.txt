VIŚĀKHA I¦. One of the three brothers of Skanda-
<div n="lb"/>deva. The other two were Śākha and Naigameya.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story regarding them in Mahābhārata, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Skandadeva approached his father Śiva. At that
<div n="lb"/>time Śiva, Pārvatī, Agni and Gaṅgā, all wished
<div n="lb"/>in their minds that Skanda should come to him or her.
<div n="lb"/>Understanding the desire of each, by Yogabala (the
<div n="lb"/>power obtained by union with the Universal Soul)
<div n="lb"/>Skanda divided himself into four persons, Skanda,
<div n="lb"/>Viśākha, Śākha and Naigameya and went to each of
<div n="lb"/>them respectively and fulfilled their desire. (For
<div n="lb"/>further details see under Subrahmaṇya).
