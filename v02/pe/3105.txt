KĀLAKEYA¦(S). (KĀLAKHAÑJAS).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The Asuras who were born to Kālā (Kālikā)
by Kaśyapa Prajāpati, the son of Marīci and Brahmā's
grandson.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%General.%} “Kālakeya” is not the proper name of
a particular Asura. The sons of Kālā (Kālikā) are all
collectively called Kālakeyas. They number about
60,000. Sometimes they fought under the leadership of
Vṛtrāsura and at other times under other Asura
leaders.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Agastya and the Kālakeyas.%} Once the Kālakeyas
started a campaign of hatred against Brāhmaṇas. At
nightfall they used to enter Brāhmaṇa premises and
commit murders, disturb their yāgas, etc. The Brāhmaṇas
complained to the sage Agastya. Agastya set out to
capture the Kālakeyas, who were alarmed and hid
themselves in the ocean. Agastya dried up the ocean by
drinking it. But some of the Kālakeyas escaped and
fled to Pātāla. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 101).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Arjuna and the Kālakeyas.%} The headquarters of the
Asuras was Hiraṇyapura, situated near Devaloka. Once
they allied themselves with thousands of other Asuras
called “Nivātakavacas” and launched an attack on
Devaloka. Indra sent his charioteer Mātali and brought
Arjuna to Devaloka. Arjuna defeated the Nivātakavacas
and Kālakeyas in battle. A large number of Kālakeyas
were killed in the battle. (M.B. Vana Parva Chapters
172-175).
