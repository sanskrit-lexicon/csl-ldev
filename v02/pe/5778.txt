ṚṢABHA II¦. A muni (sage) who was the grandson of
King Agnīdhra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%}
<div n="NI"/>Ṛṣabha was the son of King Nābhi by his wife Meru-
devī. One hundred sons were born to Ṛṣabha by his
wife Jayantī. After entrusting his kingdom to Bharata,
the eldest of his sons, Ṛṣabha went to the forest and
did tapas in Pulaha's āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ṛṣabha and Ṛṣabhakūṭa%} Ṛṣabha did tapas in the
forest for many years. The mountain peak on which
he performed his tapas got the name “Ṛṣabhakūṭa”.
The sage who wished to observe strict silence did not
like the presence of strangers and visitors in the vicinity.
So he pronounced a curse that the mountain should
drop boulders on any one who ventured to come there.
Once he ordered the wind to blow without noise as it
passed by the side of the mountain. He declared that
anyone who made noise in Ṛṣabhakūṭa would be
struck with thunder. A place of holy waters came into
existence there. (M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The power of Ṛṣabha's Yāga.%} Ṛṣabha became a
devotee of Śiva by worshipping him.
<div n="NI"/>Once a Brāhmaṇa named Mandara had an illicit
alliance with Piṅgalā, a prostitute. Both of them died
together. Mandara was re-born as Bhadrāyu, the
grandson of Nala and Piṅgalā as Sumati, the wife of
King Vajrabāhu (Aṃśumān). Sumati became pregnant.
Her co-wives who were jealous of her poisoned her.
As a result of it, she and the child born to her fell
victims to diseases. Daśārṇa abandoned them in the
forest. Sumati lived in the house of a Vaiśya with her
child. While living there, the child died of disease. Ṛṣa-
[Page651-b+ 65]
bha went to the grief-stricken Sumati and comforted her.
(Śiva Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ṛṣabha's End.%} Ṛṣabha performed tapas according to
the rules of Vānaprastha āśrama and conducted yāgas
as ordained by Śāstras. On account of his austerity he
became so lean and thin that all the veins in the body
could be seen. Putting a pebble in his mouth, he went
about in the forest, determined to renounce his body.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Chapter 1, Section 1).
<div n="NI"/>In the course of his wanderings in the forest a wild fire
broke out in which his body was burnt up. Śiva Purāṇa
says that the soul of Ṛṣabha who died in the wild fire,
attained Śiva Loka.
