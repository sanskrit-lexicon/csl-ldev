BHĪMA¦. Bhīmasena, one of the five Pāṇḍavas.
<F>1) Since much information about Bhīma is given under the captions Dharmaputra, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Pāñcālī only
<div n="lb"/>a brief description of Bhīma is attempted under the present heading.</F>
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} (See genealogy of Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and childhood.%} King Vicitravīrya of Candra
<div n="lb"/>vaṃśa (lunar dynasty) had two sons called Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. The Kauravas (Duryodhana etc.) were
<div n="lb"/>sons born to Dhṛtarāṣṭra of his wife Gāndhārī, and the
[Page129-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas were the sons of Pāṇḍu and his wives Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>and Mādrī. Dharmaputra, Bhīma and Arjuna were
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Kuntī, and Nakula and Sahadeva of
<div n="lb"/>Mādrī.
<F>1) The Pāṇḍavas were not in fact direct issues of Pāṇḍu. For details see Kuntī.</F>
<div n="NI"/>Kuntī directed a mantra gifted to her by Durvāsas to-
<div n="lb"/>wards Vāyubhagavān (the wind-god) and the result
<div n="lb"/>was the birth of Bhīma. Hence he is called Vāyu-putra
<div n="lb"/>(son of the wind-god). At the time of his birth a celestial
<div n="lb"/>voice announced that the boy would grow up to be the
<div n="lb"/>strongest among the strong. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 14). On the tenth day after birth the child Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>fell from his mother's lap on a rock. Bhīma was not
<div n="lb"/>injured in any manner by that fall, although it crushed
<div n="lb"/>the rock into power. (This story is told in the southern
<div n="lb"/>texts of the Mahābhārata in Chapter 132 of Ādi Parva).
<div n="lb"/>The naming ceremony of the child was performed by
<div n="lb"/>the Maharṣis, who stayed at Śataśṛṅga. Kaśyapa Maha-
<div n="lb"/>rṣi, family priest of Vasudeva performed the ceremonies
<div n="lb"/>like wearing of the sacred thread. Bhīma learned fight-
<div n="lb"/>ing with the gadā (club or mace) from Śuka, the famous
<div n="lb"/>Rājarṣi.
<div n="NI"/>The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas spent their childhood
<div n="lb"/>in Hastināpura. Droṇācārya taught them fighting
<div n="lb"/>with weapons. The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas often
<div n="lb"/>engaged themselves in children's games. In all such
<div n="lb"/>games Bhīma used to hurt and defeat the Kauravas,
<div n="lb"/>and to this fact the unending hatred of the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>towards Bhīma owed its origin. Once they adminis-
<div n="lb"/>tered poison to Bhīma who fell down unconscious, and
<div n="lb"/>then they threw him into the depths of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>(Ganges). Going deeper and deeper in the waters
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma, at last, reached the Nāgaloka, where the nāgas
<div n="lb"/>(serpents) bit him which neutralized the effects of the
<div n="lb"/>poison in his body. There he got acquainted with a
<div n="lb"/>nāga called Āryaka, who introduced him to Vāsuki,
<div n="lb"/>king of the nāgas, and Vāsuki presented him with much
<div n="lb"/>wealth and other costly gems. But, what use was all
<div n="lb"/>this wealth to Bhīma? Then Vāsuki agreed to give him
<div n="lb"/>a divine drink, which would give the user of it the
<div n="lb"/>strength of thousand elephants. Bhīma drank at one
<div n="lb"/>draught eight pot-fulls of that divine drink, and thus
<div n="lb"/>became tremendously strong. But, he had to wait in
<div n="lb"/>Nāgaloka for eight days so that the drink might be
<div n="lb"/>thoroughly assimilated, and on the ninth day the nāgas
<div n="lb"/>saw him off in all pomp and splendour. Bhīma returned
<div n="lb"/>to his mother and brothers and consoled them, who
<div n="lb"/>were terribly anxious at his absence.
<div n="NI"/>When the training of the princes in the use of weapons
<div n="lb"/>was over a competition or test was conducted. Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana and Bhīma entered into a ‘club-fight’, and when
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa tried to intervene in the fight his nobility was
<div n="lb"/>questioned by Bhīma. Duryodhana then insulted Bhīma.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna agreed to present King Drupada before Droṇā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya as gurudakṣinā to him. In the fierce war the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas fought with Drupada, Bhīma annihilated the
<div n="lb"/>elephant division of the latter's army. And, afterwards
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma underwent higher training in club-war at the
<div n="lb"/>hands of Balabhadrarāma. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 136,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Pāṇḍavas left Hastināpura.%} As enmity between
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas began growing stronger
<div n="lb"/>and stronger, Duryodhana, with his father's permission,
<div n="lb"/>removed the Pāṇḍavas to vāraṇāvata and settled them
<div n="lb"/>there. They were put up there in a palace specially
[Page129-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>made of lac. The Pāṇḍavas divined the secret of it and
<div n="lb"/>escaped from the fire, when the palace was set fire to.
<div n="lb"/>Verse 10, Chapter 147 of the Ādi Parva states that it
<div n="lb"/>was Bhīma, who set fire to the palace. Escaping thus
<div n="lb"/>through a tunnel the Pāṇḍavas travelled a great distance
<div n="lb"/>in the forest. Kuntī and four of her sons got tired by the
<div n="lb"/>exertions of the travel and were forced to sit down for
<div n="lb"/>rest on the way. Bhīma, continued the journey carrying
<div n="lb"/>the mother and his four brothers on his shoulders. With
<div n="lb"/>their entry into Hiḍiṃba forest the weakness left them,
<div n="lb"/>and they became their former selves.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Hiḍiṃba killed.%} Kuntī devī and four sons slept under
<div n="lb"/>the shade of a tree at dusk, and Bhīma kept guard over
<div n="lb"/>them. There dwelt in the forest a Rākṣasa called Hiḍiṃba
<div n="lb"/>with his sister, Hiḍiṃbī. Hiḍiṃba looked around that
<div n="lb"/>particular day from the top of a tree, and detecting
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma his mouth watered. He deputed Hiḍimbī to
<div n="lb"/>bring Bhīma over to him. Hiḍiṃbī approached Bhīma,
<div n="lb"/>whose fine figure kindled feelings of love in her. She
<div n="lb"/>desired to have him as husband. Hiḍiṃbī having not
<div n="lb"/>returned even after a long time Hidiṃba went over to
<div n="lb"/>the spot, and there finding Hiḍiṃbī in love-talks with
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma he got terribly angry. He wanted to kill Hiḍiṃbī.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma, who could not suffer the killing of a woman in
<div n="lb"/>his presence rushed against Hiḍiṃba, The noise of the
<div n="lb"/>fight awakened the other Pāṇḍavas from sleep, and at
<div n="lb"/>the instance of Arjuna, Bhīma killed Hiḍiṃba. Thus
<div n="lb"/>rendered helpless and forlorn Hiḍiṃbī again craved
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma for love. On the suggestion of Kuntī, whose
<div n="lb"/>heart melted at the sight of Hiḍiṃbī's helplessness Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>took her as his wife. But, one condition was stipulated
<div n="lb"/>for their enjoying the honey-moon. The condition was
<div n="lb"/>that they might enjoy honey-moon, from dawn to dusk
<div n="lb"/>in the sky and on mountain tops, Hiḍiṃbī, who was
<div n="lb"/>endowed with magic powers carrying Bhīma with her.
<div n="lb"/>And, after dusk Bhīma was to be returned to Kuntī.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Bhīma and Hiḍiṃbī spent one year, and
<div n="lb"/>to them was born a son called Ghaṭotkaca. Promising
<div n="lb"/>that he shall return when wanted, Ghaṭotkaca with his
<div n="lb"/>mother went into the forest. The Pāṇḍavas also left
<div n="lb"/>for the village called Ekacakrā. (Ādi Parva, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>147-154).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Killing of Baka and the wedding of Pāñcālī.%} While at
<div n="lb"/>Ekacakrā Bhīma killed the Rākṣasa called Baka and
<div n="lb"/>freed the people of the village from their distress.
<div n="lb"/>Afterwards the Pāṇḍavas attended the Svayamvara
<div n="lb"/>(free choice of the husband by woman) of Pāñcālī,
<div n="lb"/>who became their wife. There Bhīma defeated Śalya
<div n="lb"/>in fight. And, the Pāṇḍavas duly returned to Hastinā-
<div n="lb"/>pura. (For details see Baka, Pāñcālī and Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Again to forest.%} On their return to Hastinapura the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas took their residence in the palace built by
<div n="lb"/>Maya. There Maya presented a magnificent club to
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 18). It was
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, lord of Dvārakā who served as the right hand
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas. Jarāsandha, who was then King of
<div n="lb"/>Magadha fought with Kṛṣṇa eighteen times and got
<div n="lb"/>defeated. Yet he did not yield, and at last Kṛṣṇa decided
<div n="lb"/>to do away with him. Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna and Bhīma, in
<div n="lb"/>disguise, set out for Magadha. They entered Jarāsandha's
<div n="lb"/>palace and challenged him to a duel. Bhīma and Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha clashed, and at the instance of Kṛṣṇa Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>rent the latter in two and threw him on the ground.
<div n="lb"/>Though Jarāsandha was alive again, Bhīma rent him
[Page130-a+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>in two and threw away the two parts to two places.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Southern Text, Chapter 24).
<div n="NI"/>The main impediments and thorns in their way thus
<div n="lb"/>having been removed, Dharmaputra decided to perform
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya. Bhīma was deputed to conquer all the king-
<div n="lb"/>doms in the eastern part of India. Bhīma achieved the
<div n="lb"/>object and returned with great wealth to Indraprastha.
<div n="lb"/>Though Bhīma got ready to kill Śiśupāla, who alone
<div n="lb"/>refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb"/>he also yielded on the tactful advice of Bhīṣma. The
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya Yajña went off quite successfully. It was
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma, who, after the Yajña was over, took Bhīṣma and
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira to Hastināpura. Afterwards, in the contest
<div n="lb"/>in the game of dice played between Dharmaputra and
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana, the Pāṇḍavas lost everything. The Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>vas brought Pāñcālī into the assembly hall and attempted
<div n="lb"/>to strip her naked in public. Bhīma who got enraged at
<div n="lb"/>this shouted that the hands of Yudhiṣṭhira who played
<div n="lb"/>dice should be burnt in fire. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 6). And, Bhīma took then and there the terrible
<div n="lb"/>pledge that he would, with his hands stained by blood
<div n="lb"/>from the chest of Duśśāsana, who tried to rip Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>naked, tie up Pāñcālī's hair which got untied in the
<div n="lb"/>scuffle. He also swore that he would break the thigh of
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana. In uncontrollable rage Bhīma also shouted
<div n="lb"/>that he would turn into ashes all those who took part in
<div n="lb"/>the game of dice. Bhīma took also the vow that all the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas would be killed.
<div n="NI"/>According to the terms and conditions laid down with
<div n="lb"/>regard to the contest in the game of dice the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>went into the Kāmyaka forest to live there for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years and then to live incognito for one year.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Life in forest and life incognito.%} There lived in Kām-
<div n="lb"/>yaka forest a Rākṣasa called Kirmīra, brother of Bala,
<div n="lb"/>whom Bhīma had killed on an earlier occasion. Kirmīra,
<div n="lb"/>who was awaiting an opportunity to avenge the murder
<div n="lb"/>of his brother, now clashed with Bhīma in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma did very easily kill him. (For details see Kir-
<div n="lb"/>mīra).
<div n="NI"/>Thus the Pāṇḍavas spent their days once again in the
<div n="lb"/>Kāmyaka forest under the spiritual leadership of sage
<div n="lb"/>Dhaumya. They thought about their lost kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>Should they go to war against the Kauravas or should
<div n="lb"/>they spend the rest of their lives in the exercise of dhārmic
<div n="lb"/>injunctions? At one time Bhīma advised Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>against war; but on another occasion he pleaded vehe-
<div n="lb"/>mently in favour of war. It was during this time that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna went to the Himālayas to please Śiva by penance
<div n="lb"/>and get from him the Pāśupatāstra. (Arrow called
<div n="lb"/>Pāśupata). The Pāṇḍavas naturally got nervous and
<div n="lb"/>upset at the rather long absence of Arjuna; Bhīma was
<div n="lb"/>more anxious and sorry than the others. Then the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas set out in search of Arjuna, and travelled upto
<div n="lb"/>Mount Gandhamādana. Then the party got so tired
<div n="lb"/>that they could not proceed any further. Pāñcālī fell
<div n="lb"/>down fainting. Then Bhīma remembered Ghaṭotkaca,
<div n="lb"/>who appeared before his father (Bhīma) at once. As
<div n="lb"/>directed by Bhīma Ghaṭotkaca mounted the Pāṇdavas
<div n="lb"/>on his shoulders and the journey continued. They
<div n="lb"/>reached the Āśrama of Naranārāyaṇas, and rested there
<div n="lb"/>for six days. One day the wind blowing from the north-
[Page130-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>east dropped near Pāñcālī a Saugandhika flower. And,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma set out in the north-east direction to fetch saugan-
<div n="lb"/>dhika flowers for Pāñcālī, who felt a special liking for
<div n="lb"/>them.
<div n="NI"/>Walking and walking Bhīma entered Kadalīvana.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān, his skin wrinkled and hair grey due to old
<div n="lb"/>age, was living in this forest. He obstructed the path of
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma. Hanūmān awoke from sleep and raised his tail
<div n="lb"/>with a terrific sound. Bhīma walked upto the place
<div n="lb"/>whence the sound was heard.
<F>1. When raised, Hanūmān's tail was as high in the sky as the flag of Indra, and produced a thunderous sound. As though the
<div n="lb"/>mountains were vomitting through their mouth, the sound produced by the raising of the tail shook the mountains. Drowning the trumpeting of
<div n="lb"/>excited elephants the sound reverberated all around the mountains. Hearing the sound Bhīma, his whole body horripilated entered the
<div n="lb"/>forest in the direction of the sound. In the middle of Kadalīvana, on a mighty rock, Bhīma saw Hanūmān.</F> (Vanaparva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>146). In the clash that ensued between Hanūmān and
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma the former came out victorious. Hanūmān,
<div n="lb"/>however, congratulated Bhīma and directed him on the
<div n="lb"/>path to the saugandhika forest.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīmasena reached the saugandhika forest, which was
<div n="lb"/>being guarded by the Rākṣasas called Krodhavaśas.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma overcame them, collected the flowers and return-
<div n="lb"/>ing with them stayed in the Badarikāśrama with his
<div n="lb"/>brothers and Pāñcālī. Here it was that Bhīma killed
<div n="lb"/>Jaṭāsura. (For details see Jaṭāsura II).
<div n="NI"/>Four years were thus spent; yet Arjuna had not returned.
<div n="lb"/>The Pāṇḍavas continued their journey northward.
<div n="lb"/>On the 17th day they came to the Āśrama of Vṛṣaparvā
<div n="lb"/>in the Himālayas. They were duly received by the
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi, who directed them in their onward journey.
<div n="lb"/>Continuing the journey they reached the Āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa whence, after crossing various mountain peaks
<div n="lb"/>and still walking they reached Kubera's Alakāpurī when
<div n="lb"/>a Yakṣa called Maṇimān obstructed their further pro-
<div n="lb"/>gress. Bhīma killed Maṇimān and the other Yakṣas who
<div n="lb"/>rushed to his support. Finally Kubera himself saw
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma and blessed the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>While they were returning from Kubera's palace Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>was caught by a python. But, it was really Nahuṣa
<div n="lb"/>transformed into a python on account of a curse. Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>killed it and it assumed its original form as Nahuṣa.
<div n="lb"/>(See Agastya, Para 8). By this time Arjuna had obtained
<div n="lb"/>Pāśupatāstra from Śiva and he duly returned to his
<div n="lb"/>brothers, and the Pāṇḍavas continued their journey in
<div n="lb"/>the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Meantime, knowing that the Pāṇḍavas were put up in
<div n="lb"/>Dvaitavana, the Kauravas started for their dwelling
<div n="lb"/>place in a procession led by Duryodhana with the army
<div n="lb"/>and camped nearly two furlongs away from a pool in
<div n="lb"/>Dvaitavana. While thus camping Duryodhana clashed
<div n="lb"/>with a Gandharva called Citrasena, who with a number
<div n="lb"/>of his comrades came to the pool for water games,
<div n="lb"/>and in the encounter the latter made Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>prisoner. Bhīmasena who witnessed the scene very much
<div n="lb"/>laughed at Duryodhana. But, Arjuna intervened and
<div n="lb"/>set free Duryodhana and others.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas again entered the Kāmyaka forest, and
<div n="lb"/>it was at that time that Jayadratha abducted Pāñcālī.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma killed Koṭikāsya who acted on behalf of Jaya-
<div n="lb"/>dratha. (See Koṭikāsya). Moreover Bhīma captured
<div n="lb"/>Jayadratha, got his head shaved clean and declared that
<div n="lb"/>he was a slave of Dharmaputra. It was here at Dvaita-
<div n="lb"/>vana that Dharmadeva tested the Pāṇḍavas, who had
<div n="lb"/>gone to a nearby pool to fetch water; all the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>except Yudhiṣṭhira died at the pool, but were brought
<div n="lb"/>back to life again. (See Dharmaputra, Para 7). The
[Page131-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>twelve years’ forest-life of the Pāṇḍavas now came to
<div n="lb"/>an end.
<div n="NI"/>According to the advice of Dharmadeva the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>selected the Virāṭa palace for their life incognito, Bhīma-
<div n="lb"/>sena assuming the name Vallava (Valala). And, here
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma killed in a duel Jīmūta, the pugilist. (See Jīmūta
<div n="lb"/>II). It was also here that Bhīma killed Kīcaka and the
<div n="lb"/>Upakīcakas. (See Kīcaka). On another occasion, at
<div n="lb"/>the instance of Yudhiṣṭhira Bhīma took Sudharmā, King
<div n="lb"/>of Daśārṇa to Yudhiṣṭhira captive; but he was later set
<div n="lb"/>free. Next year the Pāṇḍavas defeated Duryodhana in
<div n="lb"/>the fight in connection with the theft of the cows of the
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa King, and then they declared that their forest
<div n="lb"/>life and life incognito were over.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bhīma in the great war.%} Even after the return of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas after the forest life and life incognito the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas refused to give them half of the kingdom. So,
<div n="lb"/>both the parties began preparations for war. Given here-
<div n="lb"/>under is the main incident relating to Bhīma from this
<div n="lb"/>period to the Svargārohaṇa (going to Heaven) of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas after relinquishing the kingdom in favour of
<div n="lb"/>Parīkṣit, including their victory in war and the adminis-
<div n="lb"/>tration of the country.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Sañjaya described to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the prowess and
<div n="lb"/>achievements of Bhīma. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 50).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Śrī Kṛṣṇa before leaving for the Kaurava assembly
<div n="lb"/>for compromise talks asked for the views of Bhīma about
<div n="lb"/>the whole problem, and Bhīma opined that peace was
<div n="lb"/>preferable to war. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74).
<div n="NI"/>(3) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa admonished Bhīma he opted for war
<div n="lb"/>and waxed eloquent about his heroism and prowess.
<div n="lb"/>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 76).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Bhīma wanted Śikhaṇḍī to be appointed chief of the
<div n="lb"/>army. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 161).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Bhīma sent back with an insulting reply Ulūka,
<div n="lb"/>who was sent by Duryodhana to the Pāṇḍavas with a
<div n="lb"/>message. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 163).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Bhīma questioned Dharmaputra who, when the
<div n="lb"/>armies had taken position on opposite sides, went on foot
<div n="lb"/>to the Kaurava assembly without bow and arrows.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 17).
<div n="NI"/>(7) The world shuddered at the war cry of Bhīma.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 44, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>(8) On the first day of the war Bhīma fought a duel with
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(9) In the fight with the Kaliṅgas Bhīma killed Śakra-
<div n="lb"/>deva. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 54, Verse 24).

<div n="NI"/>(96) It was Bhīma who, along with the brahmins,

[Page133-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ṭhira's Aśvamedhayajña. (Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter

<div n="lb"/>and foodgrains. (Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 88, Verse

<div n="lb"/>Text, Chapter 92).
<div n="NI"/>(99) Bhīma opposed Dhṛtarāṣṭra's demand for money to
<div n="lb"/>perform the rituals of those who had died in war. (Āśra-
<div n="lb"/>mavāsika Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 7).
<div n="NI"/>(100) After Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Kuntī and Gāndhārī retired into
<div n="lb"/>the forest Bhīma visited them once. (Āśramavāsika
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 23).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bhīma's conceit put down.%} While, after the great war,
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas and Śrī Kṛṣṇa were discussing several
<div n="lb"/>matters all the Pāṇḍavas except Bhīma said they owed
<div n="lb"/>their success in war to Kṛṣṇa. But, Bhīma, in all haughti-
<div n="lb"/>ness claimed the credit for victory to his personal prowess.
<div n="lb"/>With the object of putting down this conceit on the part
<div n="lb"/>of Bhīma, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, with Bhīma seated along with him
<div n="lb"/>on Garuḍa, set out on a journey to the south. After
<div n="lb"/>crossing the sea and Mount Subela Śrī Kṛṣṇa, pointing
<div n="lb"/>out to Bhīma a lake twelve yojanas wide and lying
<div n="lb"/>near Laṅkā, asked him to find out the source of the lake
<div n="lb"/>and return with the information. Though Bhīma walked
<div n="lb"/>some distance he could not find out its source. Not only
<div n="lb"/>that, all the warriors there jointly attacked Bhīma, and
<div n="lb"/>finding himself impotent to counter the attack he ran
<div n="lb"/>back to Śrī Kṛṣṇa for refuge. Then Śrī Kṛṣṇa with his
<div n="lb"/>ring clipped and threw away the lake, and said to Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—“This is the skull of Kumbhakarṇa killed
<div n="lb"/>by Śrī Rāma in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war. The warriors
<div n="lb"/>who attacked you are the asuras called ‘Sarogeyas’.”
<div n="lb"/>These words of the lord put down Bhīma's conceit,
<div n="lb"/>and he apologised to Kṛṣṇa. (Skanda Purāṇa, 1.2.66).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Death.%} After entrusting matters of administration of
<div n="lb"/>the country to Parīkṣit the Pāṇḍavas set out on their
<div n="lb"/>great journey. Yudhiṣṭhira walking in the front, they
<div n="lb"/>started for Kailāsa. During the course of their journey
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī, Sahadeva, Nakula and Arjuna one after the
<div n="lb"/>other fell down dead. Bhīma asked Yudhiṣṭhira the
<div n="lb"/>reason for the deaths and he was given suitable answers
<div n="lb"/>by the latter. At last when Bhīma too was about to fall
<div n="lb"/>down and die he asked the reason thereof, and Yudhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭhira replied that Bhīma's over-eating was the reason.
<div n="lb"/>Afterwards when Dharmaputra entered Heaven he
<div n="lb"/>found his brothers had already their seats there. (See
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, Para 31).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Other information.%} (1) Bhīma had a son named
<div n="lb"/>Sutasoma by Pāñcālī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 95, Verse
<div n="lb"/>75).
<div n="NI"/>2) A son called Sarvaga was born to Bhīma of Balan-
<div n="lb"/>dharā, daughter of the King of Kāśī. (Ādi Parva,
