ŚAKUNTALĀ¦. Foster-daughter of sage Kaṇva.
<div n="NI"/>1) Birth. Śakuntalā was a daughter born to Viśvā-
mitra of the Apsarā woman called Menakā. Viśvāmitra
was engaged in intense tapas on the banks of river
Mālinī in the Himālayas. Indra deputed Menakā to
break the maharṣi's tapas. She enticed him away from
[Page671-b+ 65]
his tapas and got pregnant by him. But she forsook
the child on the banks of Mālinī and returned to
Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>2) Childhood. Birds gathered round the forsaken
orphan-child. While Śakuntas i.e. birds were petting the
child Kaṇva came that way, saw the child and took it
with him to the āśrama. As śakuntas had petted it, the
child was named Śakuntalā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%As queen.%} King Duṣyanta of the lunar dynasty
married Śakuntalā and to the couple was born the
famous Bharata. This is the original story about
Śakuntalā's married life. All the Indian languages
contain two different versions of Śakuntalā's life. One
version is that related in Vyāsa's Bhārata and the second
is that contained in Kālidāsa's Śākuntala. Many scho-
lars opine that in the matter of the Śakuntalā episode
Kālidāsa has gone a step further and for the better, and
therefore both the versions of the story are to be care-
fully studied by us.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Vyāsa's Śakuntalā.%} Śakuntalā, now grown up as a
maiden, was alone in the āśrama when King Duṣyanta,
out in the forest on a hunting expedition, came there.
In the absence of her foster-father Kaṇva, Śakuntalā
welcomed the King. They fell in love with each other
and the King married Śakuntalā according to the
Gāndharva way of marriage and lived with her for a
few days. Śakuntalā became pregnant. The King
returned to his palace.
<div n="NI"/>Kaṇva returned to the āśrama and he was pleased that
what had been destined to take place had happened.
In due course of time Śakuntalā delivered a boy, who
was named Sarvadamana. When the child was grown
up, Kaṇva sent his mother along with him to Duṣ-
yanta's palace. The King did not recognise them, but
a celestial voice convinced him that the child was his
own son. The King heartily welcomed his wife and
son and Śakuntalā lived in the palace as his honoured
wife.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Kālidāsa's Śakuntalā.%} Kaṇva brought up Śakuntalā
born to Viśvāmitra of Menakā in his āśrama and she
had two companions called Anasūyā and Priyaṃvadā.
All the three grew up and became maidens.
<div n="NI"/>King Duṣyanta, who went out hunting in the forest
followed a deer to Kaṇva's āśrama where he saw
Śakuntalā watering the garden with her companions.
Kaṇva was then away at Cakratīrtha. Duṣyanta, who
fell in love with Śakuntalā, married her according to
the Gāndharva rules and lived with her at the āśrama
for a few days. Meanwhile Śakuntalā became preg-
nant, and emissaries from the palace came and the
King returned with them. He left the āśrama after
promising Śakuntalā that he would soon return to
her. He gave her his signet ring.
<div n="NI"/>Sad over the separation from Duṣyanta and immersed
in thought about him, Śakuntalā was sitting there in the
āśrama when Durvāsas came there. She did not see
the maharṣi nor welcome him respectfully. He got
angry at this and cursed her that she be forgotten by
him about whom she was so intensely thinking. Śakun-
talā did not hear the curse either, but her companions
who heard it begged pardon of the muni on behalf
of Śakuntalā and prayed for absolution from the curse.
Then he said that if Śakuntalā showed the King any
sign about their relationship the King would remember
her. Her companions did not tell Śakuntalā about the
[Page672-a+ 64]
above incidents. Kaṇva gladly welcomed Śakuntalā's
wedding with Duṣyanta.
<div n="NI"/>Days and months passed by, yet Duṣyanta did not
return and Kaṇva sent Śakuntalā, in whom signs of
pregnancy had become prominent, to the palace of the
King in the company of Gautamī and Śārṅgarava.
Anasūyā reminded Śakuntalā to take particular care
of the signet ring. On their way to the palace
Śakuntalā and others bathed in the Somavāratīrtha, and
nobody noticed Śakuntalā losing from her finger the
ring in the tīrtha. They reached the King's palace.
None noticed them. Duṣyanta did not remember
having even seen her. The signet ring was missing.
After leaving Śakuntalā at the palace her companions
returned to the āśrama. Menakā, whose heart melted
at the pathetic wailings of Śakuntalā led her to
Kaśyapa's āśrama, left her there and returned to
Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>The signet ring lost by Śakuntalā was swallowed by a
fish, which was netted by a fisherman, who went about
the streets to sell the ring extracted from inside the
fish. Servants of the King took the fisherman captive.
At the sight of the ring thoughts about the past dawn-
ed on the King and he remembered all about Śakuntalā.
His days became sad pondering over separation from
Śakuntalā.
<div n="NI"/>Śakuntalā delivered a boy at the āśrama of Kaśyapa.
The child was named Sarvadamana and he grew up
as a courageous boy.
<div n="NI"/>On his return from the devāsura war, Duṣyanta entered
Kaśyapa's āśrama where he saw Sarvadamana counting
the teeth of a lion he had captured. Having heard
details about him from the boy the King went inside
the āśrama and saw Kaśyapa and Śakuntalā. He
returned with Śakuntalā and the boy to the palace
with Kaśyapa's blessings. It was this boy Sarva-
damana, who afterwards became Bharata, the famous
emperor of India.
