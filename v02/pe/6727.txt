ŚRĪDATTA¦. Son of Kālanemi a Brāhmaṇa of Mālava
<div n="lb"/>land. Kālanemi and Vigatabhaya were the sons of
<div n="lb"/>a Brāhmaṇa named Yajñasena. After the death of
<div n="lb"/>their father they went to Pāṭalīputra for education.
<div n="lb"/>The teacher gave his two daughters in marriage to
<div n="lb"/>them. By the blessing of goddess Lakṣmī, Kālanemi
<div n="lb"/>became rich in course of time and he was also blessed
<div n="lb"/>with a glorious son. Since he was given by the
<div n="lb"/>blessing of Lakṣmī (Śrī) he was named Śrīdatta.
<div n="NI"/>Śrīdatta grew up and became an expert in archery.
<div n="lb"/>Kālanemi's younger brother, Vigatabhaya left home
<div n="lb"/>and went on a pilgrimage after his wife's death by
<div n="lb"/>snake-bite. Kālanemi's king, Vallabhaśakti was pleased
<div n="lb"/>with Śrīdatta and invited him to live in the palace.
<div n="lb"/>In this way, he became the intimate friend of the
<div n="lb"/>king's son, Vikrama Śakti. After that, Bāhuśāli and
<div n="lb"/>Vajramuṣṭi, the princes of Avantī became the friends
<div n="lb"/>of Śrīdatta. Mahābala, Vyāghrabhaṭa, Upendrabala
<div n="lb"/>and Niṣṭhūraka, who were the Minister's sons, also
<div n="lb"/>sought the protection of Śrīdatta.
<div n="NI"/>One day, Śrīdatta along with Vikramaśakti and other
<div n="lb"/>companions went to bathe to the banks of the Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>While they were there, the party of friends began to
<div n="lb"/>engage in some amusements. Śrīdatta assumed the role
<div n="lb"/>of a king and the others posed as his subjects.
<div n="lb"/>Vikramaśakti, the king's son, could not tolerate it. He
<div n="lb"/>challenged Śrīdatta for a fight. In the fight Vikrama-
<div n="lb"/>śakti was defeated. But he secretly resolved to kill
<div n="lb"/>Śrīdatta by hook or by crook. Srīdatta understood his
<div n="lb"/>secret plan.
<div n="NI"/>After leaving Vikramaśakti, Śrīdatta was walking with
<div n="lb"/>the others along the river-bank when he saw a woman
<div n="lb"/>struggling for life because she was caught in a whirlpool
<div n="lb"/>in the middle of the river. Śrīdatta at once left his
<div n="lb"/>companions and jumped into the river and swam up
<div n="lb"/>to her. When he was almost within reach of her hair
<div n="lb"/>the woman sank into the water. Śrīdatta also sank and
<div n="lb"/>followed her, but after some time, he found neither the
<div n="lb"/>woman nor even water. He found himself in a Śiva
<div n="lb"/>temple. He offered worship there and took rest in a
<div n="lb"/>park close by. The next morning a woman came to
<div n="lb"/>worship in the temple. When she returned after
<div n="lb"/>worship, Śrīdatta followed her. The woman who was
<div n="lb"/>alarmed, walked faster and at last reached a heavenly
<div n="lb"/>abode. She entered the house and took her seat on a
<div n="lb"/>cot inside. Śrīdatta also got in and sat near the cot.
<div n="lb"/>Many other women came and stood around her.
<div n="lb"/>Without any apparent reason she began to cry. Śrīdatta
<div n="lb"/>who was puzzled, asked her why she was crying. She
<div n="lb"/>replied to him in the following words:—
<div n="NI"/>“I am the grand-daughter of the Asura king, Mahābali.
<div n="lb"/>I am the eldest of his one thousand grand-daughters.
<div n="lb"/>My name is ‘Vidyutprabhā’. Viṣṇu has captured and
<div n="lb"/>imprisoned our grandfather, Mahābali. He has also
<div n="lb"/>killed our father in battle. After that he has expelled
<div n="lb"/>us all from our Capital city. To prevent us from
<div n="lb"/>entering it again, he has posted a lion as sentry
[Page736-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>at the palace gate. That lion is a Yakṣa who was cursed
<div n="lb"/>by Kubera. If any one defeats him, he would be libe-
<div n="lb"/>rated from his curse. By defeating that lion, you will
<div n="lb"/>get a divine sword. With that you can defeat anyone.”
<div n="lb"/>As soon as he heard this story, Śrīdatta rushed towards
<div n="lb"/>the lion. In the fight that followed, the lion was de-
<div n="lb"/>feated and it was suddenly transformed into the old
<div n="lb"/>Yaksa. Pleased with the hero who was instrumental in
<div n="lb"/>lifting his curse, he gave Śrīdatta a sword called “Mrgāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>kaka” and then disappeared. Vidyutprabhā entered the
<div n="lb"/>palace, accompanied by her sisters and Śrīdatta. She
<div n="lb"/>gave a ring to Śrīdatta which had the power to destroy
<div n="lb"/>the effects of poison. She fell in love with him. She
<div n="lb"/>asked him to take a bath in the tank close by after giving
<div n="lb"/>the sword to her, and undertook to kill any crocodile
<div n="lb"/>which might attack him. Śrīdatta, keeping the sword
<div n="lb"/>in his own hand, stepped into the water and sank into
<div n="lb"/>it. But he rose up in the river Gaṅgā into which he
<div n="lb"/>had jumped earlier. He reached the bank of the river
<div n="lb"/>and went in search of his companions. On the way, he
<div n="lb"/>met with Niṣṭhūraka. In the course of their talk,
<div n="lb"/>Niṣṭhūraka informed Śrīdatta that, Vallabhaśakti passed
<div n="lb"/>away and Vikramaśakti was then ruling over the coun-
<div n="lb"/>try. The new king had killed Kālanemi and was on
<div n="lb"/>the look-out for murdering Śrīdatta. Both of them
<div n="lb"/>resumed their journey and when they reached Ujjayinī,
<div n="lb"/>they met with the rest of their friends. On their way,
<div n="lb"/>a woman joined their party. She had lost her way
<div n="lb"/>while going to the land of Mālava. Śrīdatta and Niṣṭh-
<div n="lb"/>ūraka walked in the company of that woman and at
<div n="lb"/>last they arrived at a deserted city. They spent the
<div n="lb"/>night in that city. During the night when Śrīdatta
<div n="lb"/>happened to wake up, he saw to his horror, that the
<div n="lb"/>woman had killed his friend Niṣṭhūraka and was eating
<div n="lb"/>his flesh. Śrīdatta at once drew his sword and caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of her hair and was about to cut off her head when
<div n="lb"/>she was transformed into a Rākṣasa woman. She prayed
<div n="lb"/>to him not to kill her and told him her story. She had
<div n="lb"/>become a Rākṣasa woman by a curse. Long ago Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra did tapas to obtain Kubera's place. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Kubera sent her to break Viśvāmitra's tapas. Since she
<div n="lb"/>failed in her attempts to attract him by her charms, she
<div n="lb"/>tried to subdue him by assuming the form of a terrible
<div n="lb"/>monster. The sage thereupon cursed her to become a
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa woman with that figure. He declared that the
<div n="lb"/>curse would be lifted when Śrīdatta grasped her hair.
<div n="lb"/>She added that she had been killing and eating the
<div n="lb"/>inhabitants of that city for a long time and that explain-
<div n="lb"/>ed why the city had become deserted. Now that she was
<div n="lb"/>liberated from the curse, she asked Śrīdatta what boon
<div n="lb"/>he wished to have.
<div n="NI"/>He replied that he only wanted his friend to be restored
<div n="lb"/>to life. After reviving Niṣṭhūraka, she disappeared.
<div n="lb"/>Early next morning they reached Ujjayinī. There, they
<div n="lb"/>met their old friends, Bāhuśālī and others. Śrīdatta
<div n="lb"/>described to them his experiences after sinking in the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>Later, once when Śrīdatta went to a festival, he happened
<div n="lb"/>to meet Mṛgāṅkavatī, daughter of a King named Śrī-
<div n="lb"/>bimbaki. They fell in love with each other. When she
<div n="lb"/>left the place, Śrīdatta felt very much depressed. Bāhu-
<div n="lb"/>śālī and others also knew about it. They offered to take
<div n="lb"/>him to Mṛgāṅkavatī. But just then she fell down un-
<div n="lb"/>conscious, bitten by a snake. Śrīdatta soon restored her
<div n="lb"/>with the help of the magic ring which Vidyutprabhā
[Page736-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>had given him earlier. After that he returned with his
<div n="lb"/>friends to Bāhuśālī's house, leaving behind the ring
<div n="lb"/>with Mṛgāṅkavatī. The King who was deeply grateful
<div n="lb"/>for the cure of his daughter sent plenty of wealth and
<div n="lb"/>gold to Śrīdatta. But Śrīdatta gave all of them to
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuśālī's father. He was always doting on Mṛgāṅka-
<div n="lb"/>vatī and was much pained at his separation from her.
<div n="lb"/>At this stage, the princess's favourite maid came to him
<div n="lb"/>on the pretext of returning the magic ring and informed
<div n="lb"/>him that Mṛgāṅkavatī was also pining for him and was
<div n="lb"/>even prepared to die for his sake. Śrīdatta sent her
<div n="lb"/>back with a secret message of love and cheer. After that
<div n="lb"/>in consultation with his friends he made a plan to take
<div n="lb"/>the princess secretly to Mathurāpurī. On the next day,
<div n="lb"/>Bāhuśālī with three of his friends left for Mathurā
<div n="lb"/>pretending to go there for trade. He made all arrange-
<div n="lb"/>ments on the way for the secret conveyance of the
<div n="lb"/>princess. That night, Śrīdatta sent a woman and her
<div n="lb"/>daughter to the palace after making them senseless with
<div n="lb"/>heavy drink and arranged for their sleeping there. As
<div n="lb"/>directed by Śrīdatta, Bhāvanika set the palace on fire
<div n="lb"/>and slipped out of the building with the princess. Śrī-
<div n="lb"/>datta sent them at once to Mathurāpurī. The woman
<div n="lb"/>and her daughter who were burnt alive in the palace
<div n="lb"/>were supposed to be the maid and the princess. Śrīdatta
<div n="lb"/>set out to Mathurā to meet Mṛgāṅkavatī. On the way
<div n="lb"/>he saw several evil omens. On arrival at Vindhyavana,
<div n="lb"/>he saw his friends lying helpless, after having been
<div n="lb"/>severely beaten up by unknown enemies. They informed
<div n="lb"/>him that a stranger leading a powerful army over-
<div n="lb"/>powered them and galloped away on horseback, taking
<div n="lb"/>the princess with him.
<div n="NI"/>Śrīdatta immediately started in pursuit of the unknown
<div n="lb"/>enemy. Shortly after, he caught sight of the army led
<div n="lb"/>by a Kṣatriya prince who was taking Mṛgāṅkavatī on
<div n="lb"/>horseback with him. After a fierce fight, Śrīdatta
<div n="lb"/>rescued the princess from the youth, captured his horse
<div n="lb"/>and rode on it with her towards his friends. When they
<div n="lb"/>had gone a short distance, the horse which had been
<div n="lb"/>wounded in the battle, fell dead on the way. At that
<div n="lb"/>time he went in search of water to quench their thirst,
<div n="lb"/>leaving Mṛgāṅkavatī at the spot. By the time he
<div n="lb"/>returned with water, the sun had set. So he lost his
<div n="lb"/>way and wandered about in the forest till day-break
<div n="lb"/>when he reached the place where he had left Mṛgāṇka-
<div n="lb"/>vatī. But she was not seen anywhere there. To get a
<div n="lb"/>better view of the neighbourhood in the hope of finding
<div n="lb"/>her, he climbed to the top of a tree near by, after placing
<div n="lb"/>his sword on the ground. Just then a hunter named
<div n="lb"/>Śabara came that way and took up Śrīdatta's sword.
<div n="lb"/>Śrīdatta saw this, but he got down from the tree and
<div n="lb"/>instead of attacking him, merely asked him whether he
<div n="lb"/>knew about the whereabouts of Mṛgāṅkavatī. To this
<div n="lb"/>Śabara said that he thought that she had reached his
<div n="lb"/>cottage and asked Śrīdatta to accompany his followers
<div n="lb"/>to the cottage. He also offered to go with him and
<div n="lb"/>promised to return his sword after reaching there.
<div n="NI"/>Śrīdatta reached the cottage with them. Being utterly
<div n="lb"/>exhausted, he fell into a deep slumber. When he woke
<div n="lb"/>up he found that his legs were chained together. While he
<div n="lb"/>was lying thus, a woman named Mocanikā approached
<div n="lb"/>him and said:—“Why did you come here to court
<div n="lb"/>death? Śabara has now gone out on some business. As
<div n="lb"/>soon as he returns he will offer you as a sacrifice to
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrakālī. It is for that purpose that he has brought
[Page737-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>you here and put in chains. But there is yet one way
<div n="lb"/>of escape for you. This Śabara has a very beautiful
<div n="lb"/>daughter. She has fallen in love with you. If you marry
<div n="lb"/>her everything will turn out well.”
<div n="NI"/>For his own safety, Śrīdatta married Śabara's daughter
<div n="lb"/>according to the Gāndharva method. Shortly after, she
<div n="lb"/>became pregnant. Her maid Mocanikā informed her
<div n="lb"/>mother all about it. That kind and affectionate mother
<div n="lb"/>came to Śrīdatta and said:—“Śabara is a very cruel
<div n="lb"/>man. If he comes to know of this, he will never forgive
<div n="lb"/>you. Therefore you must leave the place at once, but
<div n="lb"/>you should never forget my daughter.” With these
<div n="lb"/>words she took leave of him. Śrīdatta disclosed the story
<div n="lb"/>of that sword to her and started on his journey again,
<div n="lb"/>in search of Mrgāṅkavatī. From a hunter whom he
<div n="lb"/>happened to meet on the way, he came to know that she
<div n="lb"/>was living in a place called Nāgasthala near Mathurā,
<div n="lb"/>under the protection of Viśvadatta a Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Śrīdatta at once went to Viśvadatta's house and made
<div n="lb"/>enquiries about his wife. Viśvadatta informed him that
<div n="lb"/>he had entrusted her with a Brāhmaṇa who was the
<div n="lb"/>minister and priest of King Śūrasena. He suggested
<div n="lb"/>that Śrīdatta should stay with him that day and they
<div n="lb"/>could proceed to Śūrasena's place next morning.
<div n="NI"/>Śrīdatta accordingly stayed there and started for
<div n="lb"/>Mathurā at day-break on the next day. On the way
<div n="lb"/>he took bath in a tank just outside the city. While bath-
<div n="lb"/>ing he happened to get a silk cloth and a necklace of
<div n="lb"/>beads from the bed of the tank. After his bath, he
<div n="lb"/>entered the city with the silk and necklace. Mistaking
<div n="lb"/>him for a thief, the police arrested him. Really the silk
<div n="lb"/>and necklace had been hidden in the tank by thieves.
<div n="lb"/>Śrīdatta was produced before the King with the stolen
<div n="lb"/>articles. The king condemned him to death. Mṛgāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>kavatī who was staying in the custody of the minister
<div n="lb"/>happened to see Śrīdatta being taken to the place of
<div n="lb"/>execution. She immediately ran up to the minister and
<div n="lb"/>told him that Śrīdatta was her husband. When the
<div n="lb"/>King came to know it, he ordered him to be brought
<div n="lb"/>back to the palace. As soon as Śrīdatta saw the minister,
<div n="lb"/>he felt certain doubts about his identity. The minister
<div n="lb"/>had a striking resemblance to his father's brother
<div n="lb"/>Vigatabhaya who had left home years ago. His doubts
<div n="lb"/>were confirmed when the minister revealed his identity
<div n="lb"/>and the two embraced each other after their long
<div n="lb"/>separation. Śrīdatta narrated the whole story of his
<div n="lb"/>sufferings and misfortunes beginning from the murder
<div n="lb"/>of Kālanemi up to that time. On hearing his tragic
<div n="lb"/>story, the minister burst into tears and told him that he
<div n="lb"/>had received a boon from a Yakṣī by which he had
<div n="lb"/>obtained 5000 horses and plenty of wealth. All this he
<div n="lb"/>gave to Śrīdatta and his wife.
<div n="NI"/>The king of that country had a daughter. Śrīdatta's
<div n="lb"/>next plan was to marry her also. Vigatabhaya gave
<div n="lb"/>him the necessary help. The minister took her with
<div n="lb"/>Śrīdatta and his friends on the pretext of offering wor-
<div n="lb"/>ship at the temple in Avantī. They had to encounter
<div n="lb"/>a band of robbers on the Vindhya mountain. Śrīdatta
<div n="lb"/>was overpowered and the robbers plundered all their
<div n="lb"/>wealth. Vigatabhaya and others were captured.
<div n="lb"/>Śrīdatta was taken to be sacrificed to Bhadrakālī. When
<div n="lb"/>he was about to be sacrificed, his wife, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Śabara arrived there with her son. It was within the
<div n="lb"/>territory of Śrīcaṇḍa. She stopped the robbers from
<div n="lb"/>performing the sacrifice and returned to her own house
[Page737-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>with Śrīdatta. The Caṇḍāla band took Vigatabhaya and
<div n="lb"/>others to Śrīdatta and they were released. After the
<div n="lb"/>death of King Śabara, Śrīdatta became the King of
<div n="lb"/>that wood. He got back his sword Mṛgāṅkaka. He
<div n="lb"/>married the daughter of Śūrasena. Śrīdatta's friends
<div n="lb"/>also came there. All of them joined together and killed
<div n="lb"/>Vikramaśakti in a battle. After that Śrīdatta was crown-
<div n="lb"/>ed king of the whole country up to the ocean. (Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka, Taraṅga 2).
