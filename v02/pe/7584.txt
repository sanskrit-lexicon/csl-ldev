TRIKŪṬA¦. A mountain. There are twenty mountains
<div n="lb"/>on the four sides of Mahāmeru including Trikūṭa.
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas say that the city of Laṅkā, the abode of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, was at the top of Trikūṭa. Mahāmeru is at the
<div n="lb"/>north of Bhārata. Laṅkā is to the south of Bhārata.
<div n="lb"/>Then how is it possible for Laṅkā to be on the top of
<div n="lb"/>Trikūṭa?
<div n="NI"/>There is a story to substantiate this belief. Once there
<div n="lb"/>arose a quarrel between Vāsuki and Vāyubhagavān
<div n="lb"/>and they decided to find out who between the two was
<div n="lb"/>more powerful. Vāsuki went and lay wound round
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru so tightly that even Vāyu (air) could not
<div n="lb"/>enter it. Vāyu got enraged and broke into a cyclone
<div n="lb"/>shaking the whole world. Even Mahāmeru began to
<div n="lb"/>shake but Vāsuki lay unaffected. The Cyclone began to
<div n="lb"/>increase in vigour and the devas were frightened and
<div n="lb"/>they went to Mahāviṣṇu accompanied by Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. After hearing their story Viṣṇu called Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>and Vāyu to his side and commanded them to stop the
<div n="lb"/>quarrel. Vāsuki then unwound a part of his winding
<div n="lb"/>and that was from Trikūṭa. At once Vāyu entered
<div n="lb"/>there and separating Trikūṭa from other parts carried
<div n="lb"/>it away and dropped it in the southern sea. It fell to
<div n="lb"/>the south of the southern end of Bhārata. Laṅkā is the
<div n="lb"/>city built on it by the celebrated architect,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarman.
