TRIKŪṬA¦. A mountain. There are twenty mountains
on the four sides of Mahāmeru including Trikūṭa.
Purāṇas say that the city of Laṅkā, the abode of
Rāvaṇa, was at the top of Trikūṭa. Mahāmeru is at the
north of Bhārata. Laṅkā is to the south of Bhārata.
Then how is it possible for Laṅkā to be on the top of
Trikūṭa?
<div n="NI"/>There is a story to substantiate this belief. Once there
arose a quarrel between Vāsuki and Vāyubhagavān
and they decided to find out who between the two was
more powerful. Vāsuki went and lay wound round
Mahāmeru so tightly that even Vāyu (air) could not
enter it. Vāyu got enraged and broke into a cyclone
shaking the whole world. Even Mahāmeru began to
shake but Vāsuki lay unaffected. The Cyclone began to
increase in vigour and the devas were frightened and
they went to Mahāviṣṇu accompanied by Śiva and
Brahmā. After hearing their story Viṣṇu called Vāsuki
and Vāyu to his side and commanded them to stop the
quarrel. Vāsuki then unwound a part of his winding
and that was from Trikūṭa. At once Vāyu entered
there and separating Trikūṭa from other parts carried
it away and dropped it in the southern sea. It fell to
the south of the southern end of Bhārata. Laṅkā is the
city built on it by the celebrated architect,
Viśvakarman.
