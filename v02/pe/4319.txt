MAṆIBHADRA I¦. A Yakṣa. He who worships this
Yakṣa would get his desire fulfilled. This Yakṣa is
installed in a temple near the city of Tāmralipti. If any-
body commits adultery in that place Maṇibhadra would
take him to the temple and keep him there for the night.
Next morning he would take the couple before the
King and exposing the sin would get them killed by
the King.
<div n="NI"/>Once a Vaiśya named Samudradatta committed adult-
ery and another house-holder found it out and took
them to the temple of Maṇibhadra and kept them there
Śaktimatī, the virtuous wife of Samudradatta came to
know of the mishap to her husband and the intelligent
woman went to the temple with materials for worship
and under the pretext of worshipping made the priest
of the temple open the doors. When she entered
Samudradatta felt ashamed and sat with his head bent
down. Śaktimatī gave the other woman her own dress
taking hers in return and sent her out as Śaktimatī with-
out raising the least suspicion in the priest. Then she
remained with Samudradatta, and when in the morn-
ing officers of the King came to take them they were
surprised to find that the culprits were really husband
and wife. The house-holder was punished for giving
[Page478-a+ 64]
wrong information and Samudradatta was set free with
his wife. (Kathāmukhalambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
