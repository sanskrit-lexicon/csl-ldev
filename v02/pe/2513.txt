GREEK¦ LITERATURE. Greek is one of the most
important Indo-European languages. As an indepen-
dent branch of the original Indo-European language
Greek established itself by about 2000 B.C. Even
during its earliest period Greek had four local dialects
as a result of the arrival of the Greek-speaking people
at different periods of time. Iolic, Ionic-Attic, Arcado
Cyprean and western Greek are the four dialects.
Iolese was prevalent in the Lesbos region, and this is
the dialect mainly used in the poetry of Homer. The
Ionic and Attic dialects were prevalent in Ionia and
Attica respectively. After Homer, the major portion of
Greek literature was written in this dialect. The
Arcado-Cyprean dialect was used in Arcadio and
Cyprus. The fourth dialect was also called Doric.
<div n="NI"/>Naval traditions, commerce and political power con-
tributed to the growth and development of Greek
language and literature. In each dialect, even from the
very beginning, literary efforts were made. Each of the
four spoken languages very soon developed into a
written language. But, in the very initial periods each
of the spoken dialects continued its existence in the
form of ballads and songs transferred from one man to
another. It was Homer who gave those popular ballads
an epic form and status and sowed the seeds of the
great literature of Greece.
<div n="NI"/>The golden period of Greek literature was when the
city of Athens enjoyed supreme political power.
Literature during the period set the model for future
generations. It was during this period that Greek
achieved the best in different literary forms like tragedy,
comedy, lyric, elegy, history, philosophy, oratory etc.
Pindar, Aeschylus, Herodotus, Sophocles-Euripides,
Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato and Demosthenes—
these are distinguished names who were responsible for
the great development of the literary forms referred to
above.
<div n="NI"/>Greek literature passed the Alexandrian, Roman and
Byzantian periods before it arrived at the modern
period. It was Solomos and Valoritus and others who
gave impetus and inspiration to modern Greek litera-
ture.
