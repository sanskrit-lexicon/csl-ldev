AVANTI¦ VAṂŚA. (The Dynasty of Avanti). The
dynasty of Avanti Kings had its origin in the Yadu
dynasty. Candra was born to Atri the son of Brahmā.
Budha was born to Candra, Purūravas to Budha, Āyus
to Purāravas, Nahuṣa to Āyus, Yayāti to Nahuṣa and
Yadu to Yayāti. Yadu had five sons, the eldest of whom
was known by the name Sahasrajit. The rest of them
were known as Nīlāñjika, Raghu, Kroṣṭu and Śatajit.
<div n="NI"/>Sahasrajit had three sons called Śatajit, Haihaya and
Reṇuhaya. Dharmanetra was born to Haihaya, Sahana
to Dharmanetra, Mahimān to Sahana, Bhadrasena to
Mahimān, Durgama to Bhadrasena and Kanaka to
Durgama. From Kanaka were born the four sons Kṛta-
vīrya, Kṛtāgni, Karavīra and Kṛtaujas. Arjuna (Kārtta-
vīryārjuna) was born as the son of Kṛtavīrya.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna renowned as Kārttavīrya became the supreme
lord of the earth comprising the Saptadvīpa (Seven
Islands) by the merits of his penance. He got invinci-
bility and thousand hands in battles, as boons. He
performed ten thousand sacrifices all in conformity
with the rules and regulations. To escape from loss of
wealth one had only to remember his name. It was
ordered that Kings other than Kārttavīrya, however
great the extent of their might and prowess, and the
number of sacrifices, offering of alms and penance done
be, would not stand on a par with him.
<div n="NI"/>Kārttavīrya had a hundred sons, of whom the most
famous were Śūrasena, Śūra, Dhṛṣṭa, Kṛṣṇa, and Jaya-
dhvaja. Jayadhvaja the most renowned of these five
ruled in Avanti as King. Tālajaṅgha who had several
sons, was born from Jayadhvaja.

The family of the Haihayas was split into five. They
were the Bhojas, the Avanti family, the Vītihotra fami-
ly, the Svayaṃjātā family and the Śauṇḍikeya family.
