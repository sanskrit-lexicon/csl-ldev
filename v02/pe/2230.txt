DVĀRAKĀ¦. (DVĀRAVATĪ; DVĀRĀVATĪ). The
place where the capital of Śrī Kṛṣṇa stood.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The King Jarāsandha was the
enemy of the Yādavas. To save themselves from the
attack of Jarāsandha, the Yādavas united themselves
under Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and built a strong city in the western
islands. That beautiful city was called Dvārakā. Kuśa-
sthalī, is another name of this city. The beautiful
mountain Raivataka stood as a fortress round the city
which was so strongly built that it was not possible
even for the gods to enter it. Even women could fight
sitting inside the forts. The fortress Raivataka was three
yojanas long. In each yojana three divisions of the
army were camped. In each yojana there were hundred
doors, with a strong army to guard each of them.
(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā.%} Dvārakā was the abode of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa. It excelled even Amarāvatī in beauty. There
was an efficient council of the leaders of the Yādavas.
Dāśārhī was the name of that council. Many Yādava
leaders Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Balabhadra and other luminaries
attended the council. The royal palace was as lumino-
us as the Sun and the Moon. Dvārakā was built by
Viśvakarmā. There were ditches on the four sides of
Dvārakā. There were four beautiful parks called
Nandana, Miśraka Caitraratha and Vaibhrāja. The
mountain Raivata acted as the eastern rampart of the
city. Three other mountains, Veṇumanda on the North,
Sukakṣa on the west and Latāveṣṭa on the south acted
as natural forts. On the east of the city there was a
beautiful lake. The city had fifty main gates to which
sharp machine rockets, big iron wheels etc. were fitted
for protection. It had an area of 96 yojanas
(leagues). (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38, Dākṣiṇā-
tya pāṭha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} (1) Arjuna visited Dvārakā in the
course of his pilgrimage. It was then and there that he
married Subhadrā. (M.B. Ādi Parva, 3 Chapters
from 217).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The King of Sālva attacked Dvārakā. The Yādavas
drove him back. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Dvārakā is a city, procuring beatitude. There is a
bath known as Piṇḍāraka which is pure and divine.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Stanza 65).
<div n="NI"/>(4) It was at Piṇḍāraka that Nṛga, a chameleon
[Page266-b+ 65]
attained beatitude. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
70, Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(5) It was here that the pestle of iron, which proved
the cause of destruction of the Yādavas, came out of
the stomach of Sāmba. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chap-
ter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(6) After the death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa this city was swept
over by the sea. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chapter 7,
Stanza 41).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Modern view.%} According to the modern researchers
Dvārakā was situated in the sea to the west of Gujarat.
There is a small locality near the sea, still called
Dvārakā, and the principal occupation of the people of
this place still is cattle-rearing, and trading in milk.
They claim to be the descendants of the family of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa.
