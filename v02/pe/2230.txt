DVĀRAKĀ¦. (DVĀRAVATĪ; DVĀRĀVATĪ). The
<div n="lb"/>place where the capital of Śrī Kṛṣṇa stood.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The King Jarāsandha was the
<div n="lb"/>enemy of the Yādavas. To save themselves from the
<div n="lb"/>attack of Jarāsandha, the Yādavas united themselves
<div n="lb"/>under Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and built a strong city in the western
<div n="lb"/>islands. That beautiful city was called Dvārakā. Kuśa-
<div n="lb"/>sthalī, is another name of this city. The beautiful
<div n="lb"/>mountain Raivataka stood as a fortress round the city
<div n="lb"/>which was so strongly built that it was not possible
<div n="lb"/>even for the gods to enter it. Even women could fight
<div n="lb"/>sitting inside the forts. The fortress Raivataka was three
<div n="lb"/>yojanas long. In each yojana three divisions of the
<div n="lb"/>army were camped. In each yojana there were hundred
<div n="lb"/>doors, with a strong army to guard each of them.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā.%} Dvārakā was the abode of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. It excelled even Amarāvatī in beauty. There
<div n="lb"/>was an efficient council of the leaders of the Yādavas.
<div n="lb"/>Dāśārhī was the name of that council. Many Yādava
<div n="lb"/>leaders Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Balabhadra and other luminaries
<div n="lb"/>attended the council. The royal palace was as lumino-
<div n="lb"/>us as the Sun and the Moon. Dvārakā was built by
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā. There were ditches on the four sides of
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā. There were four beautiful parks called
<div n="lb"/>Nandana, Miśraka Caitraratha and Vaibhrāja. The
<div n="lb"/>mountain Raivata acted as the eastern rampart of the
<div n="lb"/>city. Three other mountains, Veṇumanda on the North,
<div n="lb"/>Sukakṣa on the west and Latāveṣṭa on the south acted
<div n="lb"/>as natural forts. On the east of the city there was a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful lake. The city had fifty main gates to which
<div n="lb"/>sharp machine rockets, big iron wheels etc. were fitted
<div n="lb"/>for protection. It had an area of 96 yojanas
<div n="lb"/>(leagues). (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38, Dākṣiṇā-
<div n="lb"/>tya pāṭha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} (1) Arjuna visited Dvārakā in the
<div n="lb"/>course of his pilgrimage. It was then and there that he
<div n="lb"/>married Subhadrā. (M.B. Ādi Parva, 3 Chapters
<div n="lb"/>from 217).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The King of Sālva attacked Dvārakā. The Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>drove him back. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Dvārakā is a city, procuring beatitude. There is a
<div n="lb"/>bath known as Piṇḍāraka which is pure and divine.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Stanza 65).
<div n="NI"/>(4) It was at Piṇḍāraka that Nṛga, a chameleon
[Page266-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>attained beatitude. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>70, Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(5) It was here that the pestle of iron, which proved
<div n="lb"/>the cause of destruction of the Yādavas, came out of
<div n="lb"/>the stomach of Sāmba. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(6) After the death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa this city was swept
<div n="lb"/>over by the sea. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chapter 7,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 41).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Modern view.%} According to the modern researchers
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā was situated in the sea to the west of Gujarat.
<div n="lb"/>There is a small locality near the sea, still called
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā, and the principal occupation of the people of
<div n="lb"/>this place still is cattle-rearing, and trading in milk.
<div n="lb"/>They claim to be the descendants of the family of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa.
