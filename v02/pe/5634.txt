RĀKṢASA I¦. A particular sect of asuras. The ancients
<div n="lb"/>had ordained that Rākṣasas should not be killed at dusk.
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 22, Verse 22).
<div n="NI"/>Uttararāmāyaṇa, contains the following story about the
<div n="lb"/>origin of Rākṣasas. When Brahmā was reciting the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas at the beginning of Kṛtayuga he felt very hungry
<div n="lb"/>and certain forms emanated from his face. Those who
<div n="lb"/>were born from his anger assumed the form of Rā-
<div n="lb"/>kṣasas and those from his hunger that of Yakṣas. The
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas turned out to be evil folk killing and eating
<div n="lb"/>cows and brahmins. Praheti and Heti were the
<div n="lb"/>first born Rākṣasas, the latter of whom wedded Bhayā,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Kāla, and to them was born a son called
<div n="lb"/>Vidyutkeśa. He married Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā. Though a child was born to them they
<div n="lb"/>forsook it in the Himālayan slopes and went their own
<div n="lb"/>way.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Śiva and Pārvatī came that way and after
<div n="lb"/>blessing the child returned to Kailāsa. The child was
<div n="lb"/>named Śukeśa. He married Devavatī, daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva called Maṇimaya and three children were
<div n="lb"/>born to the couple, viz. Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī.
<div n="lb"/>They did tapas to propitiate Brahmā and when he
<div n="lb"/>appeared requested him thus: “We must defeat Yakṣas
<div n="lb"/>Kinnaras, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidyādharas, Yama,
<div n="lb"/>Kubera, Vāsava, Nāga kings and daityas and dānavas
<div n="lb"/>and we must not be defeated by any one. We must
<div n="lb"/>kill all enemies and they shall not kill us. We three
<div n="lb"/>shall never quarrel among ourselves.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā granted all their prayers. The three, proud and
<div n="lb"/>haughty due to these boons, began roaming about con-
<div n="lb"/>suming cows and brahmins. They asked Viśvakarmā
<div n="lb"/>to build a city for them and he built for them Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>on Mount Trikūṭa in the south sea. The three brothers
<div n="lb"/>took their abode in Laṅkā Mālyavān, Sumālī and
<div n="lb"/>Mālī married respectively Sundarī. Ketumatī, and
<div n="lb"/>Vasudhā, daughters of the Gandharva woman Narmadā
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān begot of Sundarī seven sons called Vajramuṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>Virūpākṣa, Durṃukha, Suptaghna, Yajñakośa, Matta,
<div n="lb"/>and Unmatta, and also a daughter called Nalā.
<div n="NI"/>To Sumālī were born of Ketumatī ten sons and also four
<div n="lb"/>daughters.
<div n="NI"/>Four sons were born to Mālī of his wife Vasudhā, and
<div n="lb"/>they became the ministers of Vibhīṣaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Then thousands of Rakṣasas were born as sons, grand-
<div n="lb"/>sons, brothers, nephews, etc. to the above and they lived
<div n="lb"/>in Laṅkā, a terror to the whole world.
<div n="NI"/>While the daughters of Sumālī, Vekā, Puṣpotkaṭā,
<div n="lb"/>Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī were once walking in the
<div n="lb"/>forest they saw Kubera on a visit to Brahmā in all
<div n="lb"/>pomp and glory. They understood that Kubera owed
<div n="lb"/>his pomp and glory to his being the son of Viśravas and
<div n="lb"/>therefore, the next day one of the four, Kaikaśī, went
<div n="lb"/>to Viśravas's āśrama and prayed for children by him.
<div n="lb"/>Three sons called Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa and Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa and a daughter called Śūrpaṇakhā were born to
<div n="lb"/>her by Viśravas. They secured boons by performing
<div n="lb"/>tapas and Rāvaṇa lived in Laṅkā as king of the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas.
