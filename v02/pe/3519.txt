KHĀṆḌIKYA¦. A Kṣatriya King. Keśidhvaja was the
<div n="lb"/>son of his paternal uncle. Both had learned well the
<div n="lb"/>ways of union with the divine life. Khāṇḍikya had be-
<div n="lb"/>come an expert in Karmayoga (the path of action) for
<div n="lb"/>becoming one with the divine life whereas Keśidhvaja
<div n="lb"/>tried to achieve oneness with divine life by Jñāna
[Page410-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Yoga (the path of knowledge or spiritual attainment).
<div n="lb"/>Each desired to subdue the other. Consequently
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍikya lost his kingdom and had to live in a forest
<div n="lb"/>with his priest and minister. (Bhāgavata, Skandhas 9
<div n="lb"/>and 13).
<div n="NI"/>Keśidhvaja who tried the path of knowledge to attain
<div n="lb"/>Absolution performed several sacrifices for that purpose
<div n="lb"/>and cut himself asunder from the bonds of action. Once,
<div n="lb"/>while he was performing a sacrifice, a tiger came to the
<div n="lb"/>place of sacrifice and killed the sacrificial cow. Then
<div n="lb"/>Keśidhvaja asked the priests who were conducting the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice, what the atonement was for the death of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial cow. The priests sent the King to the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Kaśeru, who sent the King to the hermit Bhṛgu. Hermit
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu in his turn sent the King to the hermit Śunaka.
<div n="lb"/>But the matter did not end there. The hermit Śunaka
<div n="lb"/>could not dictate the atonement for the death of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial cow. So he sent the King to Khāṇḍikya who
<div n="lb"/>was living in the forest. The moment Khāṇḍikya saw
<div n="lb"/>Keśidhvaja he stood ready to kill him. But Keśidhvaja
<div n="lb"/>revealed everything to Khāṇḍikya, When he under-
<div n="lb"/>stood the situation Khāṇḍikya told him with sincerity
<div n="lb"/>the rites given in the Śāstras (Vedāṅgas) to atone the
<div n="lb"/>death of the sacrificial cow.
<div n="NI"/>Keśidhvaja returned and completed the sacrifice. The
<div n="lb"/>one item of ‘gift to the teacher’ alone remained. So Keśī-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja came to the forest again. Khāṇḍikya raised the
<div n="lb"/>sword to cut him. Keśidhvaja said that he had come to
<div n="lb"/>give Gurudakṣiṇā to the teacher. Khāṇḍikya repented
<div n="lb"/>his rashness and requested Keśidhvaja to tell him the
<div n="lb"/>ways of cutting himself asunder from the bonds of
<div n="lb"/>sorrow and grief. Keśidhvaja advised him the ways to
<div n="lb"/>obtain eternal bliss. (Nārada Purāṇa).
