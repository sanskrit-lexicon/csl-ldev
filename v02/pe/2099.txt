DIVYAVARṢA¦(M). 365 days make one year for hu-
man beings. One year for human beings is one day for
the gods. 365 such days of the gods make one year for
the gods. This means that 365 years for human beings
are equal to one year for the gods. The year for the
gods is known as “Divyavarsa” or “Divyavatsara”.
Kṛtayuga is made up of 4,800 Divyavatsaras. Tretāyu-
uga has 3,600 Divyavatsaras. 2,400 Divyavatsaras make
up one Dvāparayuga. Kaliyuga has 1,200 Divyavatsaras.
12,000 Divyavarṣas of this kind make up one “catur-
yuga”. 71 Caturyugas are the period of one Manu.
After the end of the period of one Manu, the gods
complete their term of existence. The total period of
14 Manus is called a Kalpa. At the end of every
Kalpa there is a deluge. One Kalpa is one day time
for Brahmā. After the deluge, until the time of one
Kalpa, is Brahmā's night. There is no universe at that
time. At the end of that Kalpa, the next Kalpa
begins and Brahmā starts his work of creation.
In this way when 360 days and nights of Brahmā
are completed, it is one Brahmā Varṣa. One Brahmā
life-span is 120 such years. After that there is nothing
[Page246-b+ 64]
for a Brahmā's life-span. Then Brahmā is re-born and
resumes creation. (Bhāgavata, Daśama Skandha).
