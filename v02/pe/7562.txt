TOLA¦. A great satirical poet of the Malayālam Litera-
ture. A great humorist, Sanskrit scholar and actor, he
was minister to Bhāskara Ravi Varmā who was ruler
of Kerala during the period from 978 to 1027 A.D.
According to Koduṅgallur Kuñjikkuttan Tampurān, a
great Sanskrit scholar and poet, Tola was born in
Kondoliññāru in the village of Airāṇikkulam near Aḍūr
in Cochin in a Nambūdiri family. His original name
was Nīlakaṇṭha. When he was a young man, he was
ostracised from his community for having had illicit
connections with a low-caste servant-maid named
Cakkī. He was wearing then a deerskin belt (Tol) on
his body as the usual mark of Brahmacārins (bachelors)
and he threw it away of his own accord earning for him
the name Tola. There is another version that Tola is
the decayed form of ‘Atula’ meaning matchless. He
was mainly interested in writing funny ridicules. There
are many such poems now available believed to be
those of Tola.
