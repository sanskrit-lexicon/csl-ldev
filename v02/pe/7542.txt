TILOTTAMĀ¦. A prominent celestial maiden.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Tilottamā was born to Pradhā, wife of
Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of Marīci.
Alambuṣā, Miśrakeśī, Vidyutparṇā, Aruṇā, Rakṣitā,
Rambhā, Manoramā, Subāhu, Keśinī, Suratā, Surajā
and Supriyā were all sisters of Tilottamā. (Chapter 65,
Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the birth of Tilottamā. Two
demons named Sunda and Upasunda obtained invinci-
ble powers by doing penance. To make these two
brothers quarrel with each other, by directions from
Brahmā, Viśvakarmā created Tilottamā. Viśvakarmā
collected from all inanimate and animate objects parts
of objects beautiful to look at and created the enchant-
ing Tilottamā. Tilottamā was then made to come to
the world through the womb of Kaśyapa's wife. Be-
cause she was made by the tilāṃśa (small particle) of
all the best (uttama) articles of the world she got the
name of Tilottamā. (Chapter 215, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>The good girl named Tilottamā was formerly created
by Brahmā from small particles of diamonds. (Śloka 1,
Chapter 141, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Śiva got four heads and Indra a thousand eyes.%}
When the two demon brothers Sundopasundas were
creating great havoc in the world by their cruel and
immoral deeds, it was Tilottamā who was deputed by
Brahmā to create a split between the brothers. On the
eve of her departure to the world she went to Deva-
loka to bid adieu. Brahmā stood facing south and
Śiva stood facing north and Tilottamā stood in the
centre surrounded by the Devas. Tilottamā circled
round the devas worshipping them. Śiva was enamour-
ed of her beauty and wanted to see her always and so
a face on all the four sides of his head sprang up so
that he could see her always as she circled round him.
Indra was also enamoured of her and he found his two
eyes insufficient to enjoy her beauty. So instantly a
thousand eyes sprang up in the face of Indra. (Chapter
215, Ādi Parva).
