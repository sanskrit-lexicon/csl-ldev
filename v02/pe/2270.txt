EKALAVYA I¦. Son of Hiraṇyadhanus, a King of the
foresters. He went to Droṇācārya to learn archery.
Droṇācārya refused to accept him as a disciple because
he was a Śūdra. Undaunted he went to the forests,
made a replica of the preceptor in clay and standing
before it started practising archery. Soon he became a
matchless archer.
<div n="NI"/>Some time later the Pāṇḍavas went to the forests for
hunting. One of the hunting dogs wandering saw
Ekalavya and started barking. Ekalavya sent seven
arrows to its mouth and kept it open. When the dog
returned to Arjuna he was dumbfounded at the skill
of the archer and when he came to know the archer
was an unknown disciple of Droṇa his disappointment
knew no bounds. Droṇa had once declared that Arjuna
was the best and topmost of his disciples. Arjuna went
and complained to Droṇācārya. Droṇācārya called
Ekalavya to his side and asked him to give him as
‘Gurudakṣiṇā’ (fee to the preceptor) his right-hand
thumb. Without the least hesitation Ekalavya offered
his thumb to the guru and from that day onwards his
skill faded and he became inferior to Arjuna. (Chapter
132, Ādi Parva): Ekalavya was killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
(Śloka 77, Chapter 48, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>A son of Ekalavya seized the sacrificial horse of Arjuna
and was killed by Arjuna (Chapter 83, Āśvamedhika
Parva, M.B.).
