HEMAKŪṬA¦ (M) II. A mountain on the banks of the
river Nandā, known also as Ṛṣabhakūṭa. Once Yudhi-
ṣṭhira went to this mountain and enjoyed the many
beautiful scenes there. (See Ṛṣabha II).
<div n="NI"/>HEMAMĀLĪ I. He used to supply flowers to Vaiśra-
vaṇa. He had a beautiful wife called Viśālākṣī. Once
when he returned with flowers from Mānasasaras he
felt an onrush of love and spent time at home in love
pranks with his wife. Kubera went to the temple for
worshipping Śiva at noon and though he waited there
till dusk time for Hemamālī to bring the flowers the latter
did not come. Kubera got angry and sent for Hema-
mālī and he came trembling with fear. Kubera's curse
turned him into a leper afflicted with eighteen varieties
of leprosy, and separated from wife he fell from Alakā-
purī. At last he came to Hemādri where he met sage
Mārkaṇḍeya. Hemamālī told him all about his misfor-
tune and the sage advised him to observe Āṣāḍha-
kṛṣṇaikādasī. Hemamālī did so and got cured of the
fell disease and returned to Devaloka. (Padma Purāṇa,
Uttarakhaṇḍa, Chapter 54).
