BHĪMA VI¦. A Śūdra who attained Svarga as on his head
fell water with which the feet of a brahmin were washed.
The following story about him occurs on page 619 of
the Padmapurāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>In the dvāpara yuga there lived a Śūdra called Bhīma,
who engaged himself in the profession of Vaiśyas. An
outcaste from practices pertaining to Śūdras he enjoyed
life with a Vaiśya woman. He was a terrible fellow, who
had killed many brahmins, and also enjoyed the wives
of many elderly people including his teachers. He was
a robber as well. Once he went to a brahmin house,
and with the object of robbing his wealth spoke to him
in a pathetic tone as follows:—“Respected sire, you
will please listen to my grievance. You appear to be kind-
hearted. Please give me some rice, or else I will die this
very moment.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmin:—“Oh hungry guest! There is no one here
to cook food. I shall give you daily some rice, which
you may cook yourself. I have neither father, mother,
son, brothers, wife nor any other relatives. All of them
are dead and gone. The unfortunate fellow that I am,
I am staying here alone. No servants or others here.”
Bhīma:—“Oh revered brahmin! I too am a lonely
person. I shall live here for ever serving you. I am a
Śūdra.”
<div n="NI"/>These words of Bhīma pleased the brahmin so much that
he cooked some food quickly and served the Śūdra with
it. He stayed with the brahmin from that day onwards.
His idea was to rob the brahmin of his wealth at some
convenient time and get away. But, since he used to
pour on his head everyday the water with which the
brahmin's feet were washed he got redemption from all
his sins.
<div n="NI"/>One night a thief got into the brahmin's room to steal his
earnings. Seeing the thief Bhīma rushed at him to give
him a good thrashing. But, the thief, in the twinkling
of an eye, cut off Bhīma's head and escaped from the
scene. At once there came down the attendants of Lord
Viṣṇu to lead Bhīma to Vaikuṇṭha. A divine chariot
drawn by Rājahaṃsas (swans) also came down. Bhīma
got into the chariot and reached the abode of Viṣṇu.
