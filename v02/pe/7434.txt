ŚVETARAŚMI¦. An elephant. A Gandharva happened
<div n="lb"/>to be born as a white elephant in the Kaliṅga country,
<div n="lb"/>as a result of a curse. Śvetaraśmi is the name of that
<div n="lb"/>elephant. The King Ratnādhipa mounted that elephant
<div n="lb"/>and did many exploits.
<div n="NI"/>King Ratnādhipa was the ruler of the island Ratna-
<div n="lb"/>kūṭa. He was a prominent Vaiṣṇava. He did tapas to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu with the object of conquering the whole earth
<div n="lb"/>and to get all princesses as his wives. Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and said:—“A Gandharva has been
<div n="lb"/>born in the land of Kaliṅga by a curse as a white
<div n="lb"/>elephant. His name is Śvetaraśmi. As directed by me,
<div n="lb"/>he will come to you. You may ride him and he will
<div n="lb"/>take you through the air across the sky. All the Kings
<div n="lb"/>against whom you fight, will be defeated and they will
<div n="lb"/>offer their daughters to you as tribute.”
<div n="NI"/>Next day, the elephant Śvetaraśmi descended before him
<div n="lb"/>through the air. As advised by Mahāviṣṇu Ratnādhipa
<div n="lb"/>mounted the elephant and conquered the whole world
<div n="lb"/>and secured numerous princesses. One day as the King
<div n="lb"/>was riding the elephant and travelling through the air,
<div n="lb"/>an eagle came and pecked at the forehead of the ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant. Ratnādhipa drove it away by a thrust with his
<div n="lb"/>spear. But the elephant fell down unconscious. Even
<div n="lb"/>after five days he did not rise. The King offered prayers
<div n="lb"/>to the “Lokapālakas”. He was about to cut off his own
<div n="lb"/>head and offer it as sacrifice to them. Just then he
<div n="lb"/>heard a mysterious voice saying:—“Do not be rash;
<div n="lb"/>Śvetaraśmi will rise at the touch of a chaste woman.”
<div n="NI"/>The King at once went to the palace and brought his
<div n="lb"/>chief queen who was kept closely guarded and asked
<div n="lb"/>her to touch the elephant. But he did not rise. Then
<div n="lb"/>he ordered all the rest of his wives in turn to touch the
<div n="lb"/>elephant. Still the elephant did not rise. When he found
<div n="lb"/>that none of his 80,000 wives was a “chaste woman”,
<div n="lb"/>the King was ashamed of himself. Then he brought
<div n="lb"/>every one of the women in his kingdom and made them
<div n="lb"/>touch the animal one by one. But it was all in vain. At
<div n="lb"/>this stage, when Ratnādhipa was very much depressed,
<div n="lb"/>a merchant named Harṣagupta from Tāmralipti
<div n="lb"/>happened to come there. He was accompanied by his
[Page781-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>wife Śīlavatī. She touched the elephant and immedi-
<div n="lb"/>ately it stood up. Ratnādhipa was very much pleased
<div n="lb"/>and married Śīlavati's sister Rājadattā. After offering
<div n="lb"/>many rich presents to Śīlavatī and Harṣagupta Ratnā-
<div n="lb"/>dhipa took Rājadattā on the back of Śvetaraśmi to a
<div n="lb"/>deserted island Catuśśāladvīpa and left her there under
<div n="lb"/>the protection of several women attendants. The King
<div n="lb"/>spent his nights at Catuśśāladvīpa and days in his own
<div n="lb"/>palace.
<div n="NI"/>One day Rājadattā was remaining alone in her resi-
<div n="lb"/>dence. The attendants had gone out to attend to various
<div n="lb"/>duties. At this time a man happened to arrive there
<div n="lb"/>from somewhere. He was Bhavanasena, the son of a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya. He reached the island with the help of a piece
<div n="lb"/>of wood which was floating in the sea after a shipwreck.
<div n="lb"/>Rājadattā who heard his story, was irresistibly attract-
<div n="lb"/>ed by him and she embraced him. Just then the King
<div n="lb"/>arrived on the scene. Consoling himself by thinking
<div n="lb"/>that this was also the will of Fate, he let off the Vaiśya
<div n="lb"/>youth.
<div n="NI"/>The King returned to his palace and decided to spend
<div n="lb"/>the rest of his life by doing tapas in the forest, after
<div n="lb"/>giving away all his wealth and property to the poor.
<div n="lb"/>When he was about to mount Śvetaraśmi, the animal
<div n="lb"/>suddenly transformed itself into a man of divine glory,
<div n="lb"/>dressed in gorgeous clothes and jewels. He spoke to the
<div n="lb"/>King as follows:—“I am a Gandharva. My name is
<div n="lb"/>Somaprabha. There is my elder brother Devaprabha
<div n="lb"/>who lives on the Malaya mountain. My brother had a
<div n="lb"/>wife named Rājavatī. Once all the three of us went to
<div n="lb"/>worship in a Viṣṇu temple at a place called Siddhā-
<div n="lb"/>vāsa. At that time my sister-in-law sang a devotional
<div n="lb"/>song. A Siddha who was enchanted by her song was
<div n="lb"/>looking fixedly at her. Enraged at it, my brother asked
<div n="lb"/>the Siddha why he was staring at his wife with lustful
<div n="lb"/>eyes. The innocent Siddha was naturally provoked by
<div n="lb"/>the question and pronounced a curse that my brother
<div n="lb"/>and his wife would be born in human wombs and in
<div n="lb"/>that birth, he would see his wife having sexual union
<div n="lb"/>with a stranger. When I heard my brother being cursed
<div n="lb"/>I became very angry. I hurled a toy elephant which
<div n="lb"/>was in my hand at the time, at the Siddha. He then
<div n="lb"/>cursed me also to become a white elephant just like
<div n="lb"/>the toy with which I hit him. I am that younger
<div n="lb"/>brother and you are my elder brother. This Rājadattā,
<div n="lb"/>your queen was my sister-in-law Rājavatī. Our curse
<div n="lb"/>is now over.” As soon as he concluded, all the three
<div n="lb"/>of them renounced their earthly bodies and were restored
<div n="lb"/>to their original forms. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Ratna-
<div n="lb"/>prabhālambaka, Taraṅga 2).
