SAUBHARI III¦. A hermit famous in the Purāṇas. A
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇic story about this hermit's marrying the fifty
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Māndhātā is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Saubhari saw two fishes engaged in coition, while he
<div n="lb"/>was doing penance on the banks of the Yamunā. This
<div n="lb"/>sight aroused matrimonial thoughts in the hermit's
<div n="lb"/>mind. He instantly approached Māndhātā and in-
<div n="lb"/>formed him of his desire to marry a princess.
<div n="NI"/>Māndhātā did not like to give his daughter in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to the old hermit. Concealing his thought, he told the
<div n="lb"/>hermit as follows:—“Out of my fifty daughters, she
<div n="lb"/>who wishes to be your wife, shall be given to you.”
<div n="lb"/>Saubhari, who had already read the thought of
<div n="lb"/>Māndhātā entered the harem in the shape of a hand-
<div n="lb"/>some fine youth, and all the fifty damsels liked him.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Saubhari married all of them, and begot hundred
<div n="lb"/>sons of each of them.
<div n="NI"/>This matrimonial life lasted for some time. At last the
<div n="lb"/>hermit grew weary of this life. Discarding everything,
<div n="lb"/>Saubhari went to the forest. His wives, who also had
<div n="lb"/>become disinterested in worldly enjoyment, followed
<div n="lb"/>him. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 9; Viṣṇu Purāṇa, 4, 2, 3;

<div n="lb"/>1, 138).
