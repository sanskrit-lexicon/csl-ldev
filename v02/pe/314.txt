AṄGIRAS I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} He is a hermit born from the mind of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Six mind-born sons (Mānasa-Putras) were born to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, known as Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya,
<div n="lb"/>Pulaha, and Kratu. All the six of them became great
<div n="lb"/>hermits. (Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 65,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 10).
<F>*) There is another story about the birth of Aṅgiras. At a sacrifice celebrated by Rudra, seminal flow occurred to Brahmā who
<div n="lb"/>happened to see some celestial maids and was overpowered by passionate feelings. Brahmā put the sperm in the fire. From that fire appeared
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras along with Marīci, Bhṛgu and others. This deva (the shining one—the God) was called Aṅgiras because his origin was from Aṅgāra
<div n="lb"/>or Cinder.</F>
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Important events.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%The failure of Aṅgiras.%} There was a King named
<div n="lb"/>Citraketu in the kingdom of Śūrasena. Once Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>reached his palace when the King was in a miserable
<div n="lb"/>state as he was childless. The King informed Aṅgiras of
<div n="lb"/>his sorrow. He pacified the King and said that a son
<div n="lb"/>would be born to him. He and his wife Kṛtadyutī were
<div n="lb"/>filled with joy. The other wives of the King did not like
<div n="lb"/>this. They feared that when a son was born to Kṛta-
<div n="lb"/>dyutī the King might overlook them. To the king a
<div n="lb"/>son was born of Kṛtadyutī and the other wives poisoned
<div n="lb"/>the child and killed him. While the parents were weep-
<div n="lb"/>ing over the dead child Aṅgiras and Nārada arrived
<div n="lb"/>there and wiped their tears. Aṅgiras agreed to bring the
<div n="lb"/>child back to life. He instantly called the spirit of the
<div n="lb"/>dead child to him and asked it to become the son of
<div n="lb"/>Citraketu. The spirit replied that it had a large number
<div n="lb"/>of parents in several previous births and that it was not
<div n="lb"/>possible for it to become the son of Citraketu, and then
<div n="lb"/>it vanished. Aṅgiras and Nārada went on their way.
<div n="lb"/>Citraketu became a devotee of Viṣṇu and by the
<div n="lb"/>curse of Pārvatī, was born again as Vṛtrāsura. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 6, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%How Aṅgiras cursed Sudarśana and transmuted him to a%}
<div n="lb"/>{%serpent.%} While Sudarśana, a vidyādhara (a class of semi-
<div n="lb"/>gods) was travelling lustfully with a group of beautiful
<div n="lb"/>girls he came across Aṅgiras and some other hermits. He
<div n="lb"/>teased Aṅgiras calling him ‘durbhāga’ (unlucky) and
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras cursed him and changed him to a big serpent
<div n="lb"/>and he was promised liberation from the curse, when,
<div n="lb"/>during the dvāpara yuga (one of the four ages) Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu would incarnate as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and would tread
<div n="lb"/>upon him and then he would regain his former form.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards Sudarśana lived on the banks
<div n="lb"/>of the river Kālindī in the form of a serpent. It was
[Page040-b+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>the time when Śrī Kṛṣṇa was having his game of love
<div n="lb"/>with the Gopa women. On one night one serpent bit
<div n="lb"/>Nanda the foster father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The cowherds
<div n="lb"/>or gopas hit at the snake with burned wood. But it was
<div n="lb"/>of no use. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came there and thrashed the
<div n="lb"/>serpent, which instantly took the form of Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>Vidyādhara and praising Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, Chapter 34).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Aṅgiras a Prajāpati.%} Brahmā had created sixteen
<div n="lb"/>prajāpatis, for effecting the creation of the universe.
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras is one of them. Their names are given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) Kardama 9) Pulastya
<div n="NI"/>2) Vikrīta 10) Aṅgiras
<div n="NI"/>3) Śeṣa 11) Pracetas
<div n="NI"/>4) Saṃśraya 12) Pulaha
<div n="NI"/>5) Sthāṇu 13) Dakṣa
<div n="NI"/>6) Marīci 14) Vivasvān
<div n="NI"/>7) Atri 15) Ariṣṭanemi
<div n="NI"/>8) Kratu 16) Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Sarga 14).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%The wives and children of Aṅgiras.%} Aṅgiras had
<div n="lb"/>several wives such as Śubhā, Smṛti, Śraddhā, Devasenā
<div n="lb"/>and Vasudhā. The names of the sons of Aṅgiras are
<div n="lb"/>given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) Bṛhatkīrti 5) Bṛhadmantra
<div n="NI"/>2) Bṛhatjyoti 6) Bṛhadbhāsa
<div n="NI"/>3) Bṛhadbrahmā 7) Bṛhaspati.
<div n="NI"/>4) Bṛhadmanā
<div n="NI"/>The names of the eight daughters of Aṅgiras are given
<div n="lb"/>below:
<div n="NI"/>1) Bhānumatī 5) Haviṣmatī
<div n="NI"/>2) Rāgā 6) Māhiṣmatī
<div n="NI"/>3) Sinīvālī 7) Mahāmatī
<div n="NI"/>4) Arciṣmatī 8) Kuhū.
<div n="NI"/>Besides these sons and daughters, other sons such as
<div n="lb"/>Sudhanvā and Kārttikeya were born to Aṅgiras by his
<div n="lb"/>other wives. (Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, five chapters
<div n="lb"/>from 218).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%The clash between Aṅgiras and Prahlāda.%} Duśśāsana
<div n="lb"/>stripped Pāñcālī of her clothes in the Palace hall, in
<div n="lb"/>the presence of the Pāṇḍavas who had been defeated
<div n="lb"/>in the game of dice. Before this Pāñcālī had asked
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana one question, “Have you won yourself or
<div n="lb"/>myself?” One husband was not authorised to stake his
<div n="lb"/>wife Pāñcālī who was the wife of five husbands. Moreover
<div n="lb"/>according to the Śāstras (sciences) the deeds executed
<div n="lb"/>by a King, who was miserable due to hunting, drinking,
<div n="lb"/>playing dice and hankering after a woman, were not
<div n="lb"/>legally binding. Hence how could the Kauravas own
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī?” Vidura said that the witnesses in the hall had
<div n="lb"/>to give an impartial answer to this question, and that
<div n="lb"/>the punishment of falsehood would come upon the doer
<div n="lb"/>himself. As an instance he gave the following old story:
<div n="lb"/>Virocana was the son of Prahlāda; Sudhanvā the son
<div n="lb"/>of Aṅgiras and Virocana fell in love with the same
<div n="lb"/>woman once. There arose a contention between these
<div n="lb"/>two as to who was greater. They staked their lives on
<div n="lb"/>the issue. Then both of them together approached Prah-
<div n="lb"/>lāda and requested him to give a decision as to which
<div n="lb"/>of them was the elder. Thinking that Prahlāda might side
<div n="lb"/>with Virocana his son, Sudhanvā said to him, “Sir,
[Page041-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>you should not utter words of falsehood, nor should you
<div n="lb"/>abstain from speaking the truth. If you do so your head
<div n="lb"/>will be cut into a hundred pieces by Indra with his
<div n="lb"/>Vajrāyudha (the weapon of thunderbolt)”. Hesitating
<div n="lb"/>to take a decision, because of the words of Sudhanvā,
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda went to Kaśyapa to clear his doubts, and
<div n="lb"/>asked: “Lord, do you know which are the future worlds
<div n="lb"/>destined for those who utter words of falsehood or abstain
<div n="lb"/>from giving out the truth?” Kaśyapa said, “On him, who
<div n="lb"/>abstains from speaking truth knowingly a thousand cords
<div n="lb"/>of death will fall. He who tells falsehood will have
<div n="lb"/>to perform many a deed of duty to attain heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>Having heard the words of Kaśyapa, Prahlāda said to
<div n="lb"/>Virocana, “Virocana, Sudhanvā is greater than you.
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras is greater than me. Likewise the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Sudhanvā is nobler than your mother. So according to
<div n="lb"/>your bet you owe your life to Sudhanvā.” Pleased at
<div n="lb"/>the righteousness of Prahlāda, Sudhanvā gave Virocana
<div n="lb"/>a boon to live a hundred years more. (Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%How Aṅgiras became the first son of Agni (Fire God).%}
<div n="lb"/>Once Aṅgiras was blazing out as a furious being. All
<div n="lb"/>the worlds were illuminated by that flame-fire. As
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras was performing the functions of Agni (fire),
<div n="lb"/>peoples of the worlds discarded Agni, who being sad at
<div n="lb"/>the derision shown towards him by the worlds went to
<div n="lb"/>a forest and hid himself there. The living beings
<div n="lb"/>were in trouble owing to lack of fire. When he became
<div n="lb"/>aware of this Aṅgiras went to the forest and pacified
<div n="lb"/>Agni. From that day onwards Aṅgiras agreed to be-
<div n="lb"/>come the first son of Agni, who resumed his duties as
<div n="lb"/>usual. (Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 217).
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%How Aṅgiras got the name Atharvāṅgiras.%} After the
<div n="lb"/>slaughter of Vṛtrāsura, Indra went to the lake known
<div n="lb"/>as Amṛtasaras and hid himself there in a lotus flower. At
<div n="lb"/>this time the Gods anointed Nahuṣa as Indra. Agastya
<div n="lb"/>cursed him and turned him to a serpent and sent
<div n="lb"/>him to the earth. When Indra returned to heaven many
<div n="lb"/>persons gathered there to greet him. Aṅgiras also was
<div n="lb"/>one among them who did obeisance to Indra. He paid
<div n="lb"/>his homage by reciting the hymns of Atharvaveda. Indra
<div n="lb"/>who was greatly pleased at this, said to Aṅgiras, “Here-
<div n="lb"/>after you shall be known as Atharvāṅgiras”. Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>who got this boon from Indra, returned with gratitude.
<div n="lb"/>(Mahābhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 18, Stanzas 5
<div n="lb"/>to 7).
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Aṅgiras and Droṇa.%} In the battle of Kurukṣetra,
<div n="lb"/>between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas the great
<div n="lb"/>teacher, Droṇa began to release his divine darts towards
<div n="lb"/>his enemies in all directions. Immediately Aṅgiras with
<div n="lb"/>many other hermits came to Droṇa and told him,
<div n="lb"/>“You have burned to death innumerable men with your
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāstra (The most powerful of all missiles). Your
<div n="lb"/>end is very near. So put your weapons down and stop
<div n="lb"/>your fight.” Droṇa seems to have paid no heed at all
<div n="lb"/>to the advice of the hermits. He did not stop fighting
<div n="lb"/>too.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%The sermon of Aṅgiras on the merits of Tīrthas or holy%}
<div n="lb"/>{%places (Baths).%} Dharmaputra once asked Bhīṣma about
<div n="lb"/>the importance of holy ghāṭs or tīrthas (Baths). Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>told Dharmaputra, what Aṅgiras had once told Gautama
<div n="lb"/>about the merits obtained by going on pilgrimage to
<div n="lb"/>holy tīrthas or Baths. Aṅgiras had described the holy
<div n="lb"/>nature and character of holy Baths in Bhārata such as
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkara, Prabhāsa, Naimiśa, Sāgarodaka, Indramārga,
[Page041-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Devika, Svarṇabindu, Hiraṇyabindu, Indratoya, and
<div n="lb"/>such other numerous tīrthas. (Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 25, Stanzas 7-71).

<div n="lb"/>had been chanting and meditating in Alakanandā in
<div n="lb"/>the region of the mount Gandhamādana. (Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Araṇya Parva, Chapter 142, Stanza 6).
<div n="NI"/>(4) When the hermits had stolen the lotus flowers of
<div n="lb"/>Agastya, Aṅgiras gave some hints about the culprits.
<div n="lb"/>(Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 94, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>20: See Agastya).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Aṅgiras once gave a discourse on fasting and the

<div n="lb"/>had drunk the entire water available in the world, he
<div n="lb"/>created new springs of water again and drank them dry.
<div n="lb"/>(Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 153, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>3).

<div n="lb"/>Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(10) Aṅgiras conducted many of the important sacrifices

<div n="lb"/>also was a hermit (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 7,
<div n="lb"/>Sūkta 31).
<div n="NI"/>(15) The Hermit Aṅgiras began to invoke the Gods to
<div n="lb"/>get a son equal to Indra. Then Indra, thinking that
<div n="lb"/>nobody should be born as his equal, took birth as the
<div n="lb"/>son of Aṅgiras. He was called Savya. (Ṛgveda,
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 10, Sūkta 51).
<div n="NI"/>(16) Indra sent Saramā, the bitch of the Gods, to find
<div n="lb"/>out the place where the cows had been hidden; Indra
<div n="lb"/>acted according to the advice of Aṅgiras. At first the

<div n="lb"/>to feed her young one with milk she agreed. Saramā
<div n="lb"/>found out the place where the cows were hidden and
<div n="lb"/>informed Indra of it. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 11,
