AṄGIRAS I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} He is a hermit born from the mind of Brahmā.
Six mind-born sons (Mānasa-Putras) were born to
Brahmā, known as Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya,
Pulaha, and Kratu. All the six of them became great
hermits. (Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 65,
Stanza 10).
<F>*) There is another story about the birth of Aṅgiras. At a sacrifice celebrated by Rudra, seminal flow occurred to Brahmā who
happened to see some celestial maids and was overpowered by passionate feelings. Brahmā put the sperm in the fire. From that fire appeared
Aṅgiras along with Marīci, Bhṛgu and others. This deva (the shining one—the God) was called Aṅgiras because his origin was from Aṅgāra
or Cinder.</F>
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Important events.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%The failure of Aṅgiras.%} There was a King named
Citraketu in the kingdom of Śūrasena. Once Aṅgiras
reached his palace when the King was in a miserable
state as he was childless. The King informed Aṅgiras of
his sorrow. He pacified the King and said that a son
would be born to him. He and his wife Kṛtadyutī were
filled with joy. The other wives of the King did not like
this. They feared that when a son was born to Kṛta-
dyutī the King might overlook them. To the king a
son was born of Kṛtadyutī and the other wives poisoned
the child and killed him. While the parents were weep-
ing over the dead child Aṅgiras and Nārada arrived
there and wiped their tears. Aṅgiras agreed to bring the
child back to life. He instantly called the spirit of the
dead child to him and asked it to become the son of
Citraketu. The spirit replied that it had a large number
of parents in several previous births and that it was not
possible for it to become the son of Citraketu, and then
it vanished. Aṅgiras and Nārada went on their way.
Citraketu became a devotee of Viṣṇu and by the
curse of Pārvatī, was born again as Vṛtrāsura. (Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 6, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%How Aṅgiras cursed Sudarśana and transmuted him to a%}
{%serpent.%} While Sudarśana, a vidyādhara (a class of semi-
gods) was travelling lustfully with a group of beautiful
girls he came across Aṅgiras and some other hermits. He
teased Aṅgiras calling him ‘durbhāga’ (unlucky) and
Aṅgiras cursed him and changed him to a big serpent
and he was promised liberation from the curse, when,
during the dvāpara yuga (one of the four ages) Mahā-
viṣṇu would incarnate as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and would tread
upon him and then he would regain his former form.
From that day onwards Sudarśana lived on the banks
of the river Kālindī in the form of a serpent. It was
[Page040-b+ 61]
the time when Śrī Kṛṣṇa was having his game of love
with the Gopa women. On one night one serpent bit
Nanda the foster father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The cowherds
or gopas hit at the snake with burned wood. But it was
of no use. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came there and thrashed the
serpent, which instantly took the form of Sudarśana
Vidyādhara and praising Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered heaven.
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, Chapter 34).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Aṅgiras a Prajāpati.%} Brahmā had created sixteen

<div n="NI"/>(4) {%The wives and children of Aṅgiras.%} Aṅgiras had
several wives such as Śubhā, Smṛti, Śraddhā, Devasenā
and Vasudhā. The names of the sons of Aṅgiras are
given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) Bṛhatkīrti 5) Bṛhadmantra

<div n="NI"/>Besides these sons and daughters, other sons such as
Sudhanvā and Kārttikeya were born to Aṅgiras by his
other wives. (Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, five chapters
from 218).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%The clash between Aṅgiras and Prahlāda.%} Duśśāsana
stripped Pāñcālī of her clothes in the Palace hall, in
the presence of the Pāṇḍavas who had been defeated
in the game of dice. Before this Pāñcālī had asked
Duryodhana one question, “Have you won yourself or
myself?” One husband was not authorised to stake his
wife Pāñcālī who was the wife of five husbands. Moreover
according to the Śāstras (sciences) the deeds executed
by a King, who was miserable due to hunting, drinking,
playing dice and hankering after a woman, were not
legally binding. Hence how could the Kauravas own
Pāñcālī?” Vidura said that the witnesses in the hall had
to give an impartial answer to this question, and that
the punishment of falsehood would come upon the doer
himself. As an instance he gave the following old story:
Virocana was the son of Prahlāda; Sudhanvā the son
of Aṅgiras and Virocana fell in love with the same
woman once. There arose a contention between these
two as to who was greater. They staked their lives on
the issue. Then both of them together approached Prah-
lāda and requested him to give a decision as to which
of them was the elder. Thinking that Prahlāda might side
with Virocana his son, Sudhanvā said to him, “Sir,
[Page041-a+ 65]
you should not utter words of falsehood, nor should you
abstain from speaking the truth. If you do so your head
will be cut into a hundred pieces by Indra with his
Vajrāyudha (the weapon of thunderbolt)”. Hesitating
to take a decision, because of the words of Sudhanvā,
Prahlāda went to Kaśyapa to clear his doubts, and
asked: “Lord, do you know which are the future worlds
destined for those who utter words of falsehood or abstain
from giving out the truth?” Kaśyapa said, “On him, who
abstains from speaking truth knowingly a thousand cords
of death will fall. He who tells falsehood will have
to perform many a deed of duty to attain heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>Having heard the words of Kaśyapa, Prahlāda said to
Virocana, “Virocana, Sudhanvā is greater than you.
Aṅgiras is greater than me. Likewise the mother of
Sudhanvā is nobler than your mother. So according to
your bet you owe your life to Sudhanvā.” Pleased at
the righteousness of Prahlāda, Sudhanvā gave Virocana
a boon to live a hundred years more. (Mahābhārata,
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%How Aṅgiras became the first son of Agni (Fire God).%}
Once Aṅgiras was blazing out as a furious being. All
the worlds were illuminated by that flame-fire. As
Aṅgiras was performing the functions of Agni (fire),
peoples of the worlds discarded Agni, who being sad at
the derision shown towards him by the worlds went to
a forest and hid himself there. The living beings
were in trouble owing to lack of fire. When he became
aware of this Aṅgiras went to the forest and pacified
Agni. From that day onwards Aṅgiras agreed to be-
come the first son of Agni, who resumed his duties as
usual. (Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 217).
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%How Aṅgiras got the name Atharvāṅgiras.%} After the
slaughter of Vṛtrāsura, Indra went to the lake known
as Amṛtasaras and hid himself there in a lotus flower. At
this time the Gods anointed Nahuṣa as Indra. Agastya
cursed him and turned him to a serpent and sent
him to the earth. When Indra returned to heaven many
persons gathered there to greet him. Aṅgiras also was
one among them who did obeisance to Indra. He paid
his homage by reciting the hymns of Atharvaveda. Indra
who was greatly pleased at this, said to Aṅgiras, “Here-
after you shall be known as Atharvāṅgiras”. Aṅgiras
who got this boon from Indra, returned with gratitude.
(Mahābhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 18, Stanzas 5
to 7).
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Aṅgiras and Droṇa.%} In the battle of Kurukṣetra,
between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas the great
teacher, Droṇa began to release his divine darts towards
his enemies in all directions. Immediately Aṅgiras with
many other hermits came to Droṇa and told him,
“You have burned to death innumerable men with your
Brahmāstra (The most powerful of all missiles). Your
end is very near. So put your weapons down and stop
your fight.” Droṇa seems to have paid no heed at all
to the advice of the hermits. He did not stop fighting
too.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%The sermon of Aṅgiras on the merits of Tīrthas or holy%}
{%places (Baths).%} Dharmaputra once asked Bhīṣma about
the importance of holy ghāṭs or tīrthas (Baths). Bhīṣma
told Dharmaputra, what Aṅgiras had once told Gautama
about the merits obtained by going on pilgrimage to
holy tīrthas or Baths. Aṅgiras had described the holy
nature and character of holy Baths in Bhārata such as
Puṣkara, Prabhāsa, Naimiśa, Sāgarodaka, Indramārga,
[Page041-b+ 64]
Devika, Svarṇabindu, Hiraṇyabindu, Indratoya, and
such other numerous tīrthas. (Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana
