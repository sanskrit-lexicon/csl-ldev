PAKṢIVAṂŚA¦. The Purāṇic version of the origin of
birds is given below:
<div n="NI"/>Descending in order from Viṣṇu came Brahmā—Marīci
-Kaśyapaprajāpati. The latter got of his wife Tāmrā
(daughter of Dakṣa) five daughters named Krauñcī,
Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī. From Krauñcī were
born the Ulūkas, Bhāsī gave birth to Bhāsas, Śyenī to
vultures and Dhṛtarāṣṭrī to swans and geese. From
these originated the entire bird family of the world.
(Chapter 4, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
