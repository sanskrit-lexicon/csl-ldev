KAUŚIKA VII¦. A King. This king became a cock at
night. His wife Viśālā was filled with grief at this
transfiguration of her husband in the night. She
told her grief to the hermit Gālava who told the queen
about the previous birth of her husband as follows:—
“In the previous birth he used to eat cocks to get
strength. Knowing this Tāmracūḍa the king of fowls
cursed him. “You shall become a cock during nights.”
That is why your husband has become a cock.”
According to the advice of the hermit the King began
to worship Lord Śiva and he was liberated from the
curse. (Skanda Purāṇa).
