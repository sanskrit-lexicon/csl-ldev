MANVANTARA¦(M).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Kalpa, Manvantara and Caturyuga.%} The Prapañca
(universe) is perishable. At one time, it takes its origin,
at another time it perishes. Brahmā, the creator of
the universe has birth and death. The period between
the birth and death of a Brahmā is known as a “Mahā-
kalpa”. The flood that comes at the death of a Brahmā
is called “Mahāpralaya”. One day of Brahmā is called
Kalpakāla. In the Purāṇas one Kalpa or one day of
Brahmā is divided into fourteen parts. The master or
ruler of each of these divisions is a Manu. There are
fourteen Manus. The life span of each Manu is called
a “Manvantaram”.
<div n="NI"/>There are seventy one Caturyugas in each Manvantara.
The four yugas namely Kṛtayuga, Tretāyuga, Dvāpara-
yuga and Kaliyuga make up one Caturyuga. At the end
of seventy-one such Caturyugas, that is, at the end of
every two hundred and eightyfour (71 × 4) yugas, a
Manu completes his life-span. Along with that, the
Devas who were born at the time of the birth of that
Manu, also come to the end of their lives. Fourteen such
Manvantaras make one day of Brahmā. It is at the end
of that day that the original universe perishes. Brahmā's
life-span is 120 years. At the end of that period, that
Brahmā perishes. That is to say, at the end of every
[Page482-b+ 65]
42,200 divine days (120 × 360) which is the life-span of
a Brahmā, a deluge takes place. Thus in one Brahmā's
time 42,200 Kalpas take place. A Brahmā's life span
is known as “Mahākalpa” and the close of a Brahmā's
period is called “Mahāpralaya”.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Human year (Manuṣya varṣa) and Divine year (Deva%}
{%varṣa).%} When two leaves are placed one over the other
and they are pierced by a needle, the time required
for the needle to pass from the first leaf to the second
is called “Alpakāla”. Thirty such alpakālas make one
“Truṭi”. Thirty truṭis make one “Kalā”. Thirty Kalās
make one “Kāṣṭhā”, which is also known as “Nimiṣa”
“Noṭi” or “Mātrā”. Four “Nimiṣas” make one
“Gaṇita”. Ten Gaṇitas, one “Neṭuvīrppu”. Six neṭu-
vīrppus, one “Vināzhikā”. Sixty vināzhikās one
“Ghaṭikā”. Sixty ghaṭikās one day (day and night
together). Fifteen days, one “Pakṣa”. Two Pakṣas, one
“Cāndra māsa” (lunar month). One Cāndramāsa for
human beings is one “ahorātra” (one day and night
making up one full day) for the pitṛs. Twelve Cāndra
māsas make one year for human beings. One year for
human beings is one ahorātra for the gods. Three
hundred ahorātras of gods make one “Deva Vatsara”
or “Divya vatsara”. 4,800 divyavatsaras make one Kṛta-
yuga. 3,600 divyavatsaras make one Tretāyuga, 2,400
divyavatsaras make one Dvāparayuga. 1,200 divya-
vatsaras make one Kaliyuga. 12,000 divyavatsaras
comprising a set of Kṛta, Tretā. Dvāpara and Kaliyugas
make one Caturyuga. A Manu's period is completed
at the end of 71 Caturyugas. With that, the first
group of gods also comes to an end. At the end of four-
teen such Manus, one “Kalpa” is over and a deluge
takes place. The whole of this period comprises one
night for Brahmā. Night is the time of complete inacti-
vity. With the end of the night, creation is started
again. When 360 such ahorātras of Brahmā are com-
pleted, he completes one year. After completing 120
such years, a Brahmā perishes. Again a period of abso-
lute inactivity follows for the length of a Brahmā's
life-span. After a period of 120 Brahma varṣas (the life-
span of a Brahmā) another Brahmā comes into being.
<div n="NI"/>The life-span of Brahmā is shown in the following
tabular form:
360 days for gods—One Deva vatsara.
12,000 Deva vatsaras—1 caturyuga (36 lakhs years
for human beings).
71 caturyugas—1 Manvantaram (One
Manu's life-span).
14 Manvantaras—1 Kalpa (one day time for
Brahmā)
2 Kalpas—One day (and night) for
Brahmā. (Ahorātra)
360 days of Brahmā—1 Brahma Varṣa
120 Brahma Varṣas—One Brahmā's life-span.
<div n="NI"/>This life-span of one Brahmā is therefore 30 crores 9
lakhs 17 thousands 376 hundreds of years of human
beings.
<div n="NI"/>It is said that a Manu's period of reign is 4,32,000
Manuṣyarvarṣas. (Bhāgavata, 3rd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The caturyuga scheme.%} A caturyuga consists of the
four yugas, namely Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali
yugas. At the end of each Caturyuga, the Vedas perish
Then the “Saptarṣis” (seven sages) come down from
heaven to the earth and restore them again. Manu
who is the propounder of Dharma śāstra, is also born
[Page483-a+ 65]
in every Kṛtayuga. The Devas of each Manvantaram
feed upon the share of Havis (offerings at sacrifices) of
the yāga till the end of that Manvantara. During the
whole period of the Manvantara, the earth is protected
and preserved by the sons of Manu and their descen-
dants. Thus Manu, the Saptarṣis, Devas, Indra and the
Kings who are the sons of Manu are the authorities of
the Manvantara. After 14 Manvantaras a Kalpa of
about 1,000 yugas, comes to an end. After that there is
a night extending over the same period in duration. At
that time Mahāviṣṇu sleeps on his bed Ananta in the
ocean of deluge. After that, he wakes up again and
performs creation. Manus, Kings, Indra, Devas and
Saptarṣis are the Sāttvika aspects of Mahāviṣṇu, who
performs the work of protecting the world. In Kṛta
yuga, Mahāviṣṇu assumes the form of Kapila and others
and preaches “Paramajñāna”. In Tretā yuga he assumes
the form of an emperor and destroys the wicked people.
In Dvāpara yuga, he assumes the form of Vyāsa and
after dividing the Veda into 4 sections, classifies each
of the sections into the various branches. At the end
of Kaliyuga, Mahāviṣṇu assumes the form of Kalki and
restores the vicious to the path of righteousness. This is
the “Caturyuga scheme” of Mahāviṣṇu. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa.
Part III, Chapter 2).

<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Svāyambhuva.%}
<div n="NI"/>(a) {%General.%} Svāyambhuva was born as the spiritual
son of Brahmā. This Manu got his name because he
was “Svāyambhuva” or born from Brahmā. He married
the goddess Śatarūpā, the spiritual daughter of Brahmā.
After that, he went to the shore of the ocean of milk,
made an image of Mahādevī there and worshipped her
by chanting Vāgbhava mantra and performed an aus-
tere penance. After a hundred years of such worship the
goddess was pleased. She appeared before Svāyambhuva
and granted him boons. She blessed him to attain the
highest place in Heaven (Paramapada) after begetting
vast progeny. Then the goddess went to Vindhya moun-
tain and became the deity of Vindhya. Svāyambhuva
returned and started his reign by worshipping the
goddess.
<div n="NI"/>This Svāyambhuva is regarded as the author of the
famous work “Manusmṛti”. Kālidāsa says that the

Vairāja Prajāpati, he had 10 sons, namely, Kuru,
Puru, Śatadyumna, Tapasvī, Satyavān, Śuci, Agni-
ṣṭoma, Atirātra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Āgneyī,

Satyavrata Manu who escaped from the last deluge.
To save him Viṣṇu took up the incarnation of Matsya
(fish). Vaivasvata Manu was also the first of the Kings
of the Sūrya vaṃśa (Solar Dynasty) who ruled over
Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) Other details.%} (i) In Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama

Ikṣvāku, Nābhāga, Dhṛṣṭa, Śaryāti, Nariṣyanta,
Prāṃśu, Nṛga, Diṣṭa, Karūṣa and Pṛṣadhra were also

Vasus and Rudras. The name of the Indra of this
period is Purandara. The Saptarṣis are, Vasiṣṭha,
Kaśyapa, Atri, Jamadagni, Gautama, Viśvāmitra and
Bharadvāja. The nine Dhārmikas (virtuous ones),

Vaivasvata Manu. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 187).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) He received Yogavidyā from Sūrya and Ikṣvāku
received it later from him. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva,
Chapter 122, Verse 38).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) At the beginning of Tretāyuga, Sūrya taught
“Sātvata Dharma” to Manu and Manu taught

Śānti Parva, Chapter 348, Verse 51).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) The sage Gautama taught Śivasahasranāma to
Vaivasvata Manu. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter

[Page485-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Sāvarṇi.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%(a) General.%} Even in his previous birth he was a
devotee of Devī. In his former birth (during the
period of Svārociṣa Manvantara) Sāvarṇi was born as
a King of Caitravaṃśa under the name Suratha. The
origin of the dynasty known as Caitravaṃśa was as
follows:—Atri, son of Brahmā had a son named
Niśākara. This Niśākara became an emperor by
performing Rājasūya. Emperor Niśākara had a son
Budha and Budha had a son named Caitra, both of
whom were greatly renowned. It was Caitra's family
which later on became the reputed Caitra dynasty.
The son of that Caitra was Viratha. Suratha was
the son of Viratha. This was the previous birth of
Sāvarṇi Manu. Suratha was a great hero and poet.
Once another King besieged his city and defeated him.
Suratha left his kingdom and went alone on horseback
and took shelter in a dense forest. While wandering
in the forest like a mad man with a broken heart, he
happened to reach the āśrama of the sage Sumedhas.
The sage advised him to worship Devī in order to
retrieve his lost kingdom and prosperity. Accordingly
the King worshipped Devī who was pleased and
restored to him his kingdom and prosperity. Besides,
she blessed him that in his next birth he would become
Sāvarṇi, the King of the Solar dynasty and would be
revered as the eighth Manu. Thus the eighth Manu
Sāvarṇi will be the second birth of Suratha. (Devī
Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) Other details.%} Sāvarṇi is also the son of Sūrya.
How he came to be called Sāvarṇi is explained below:—
Sūrya had three children Manu, Yama and Yamī by
Saṃjñā, the daughter of Viśvakarmā. This Manu was
Vaivasvata Manu, the seventh Manu. Unable to bear
the intense heat of Sūrya, Saṃjñā once sent her maid
Chāyā to Sūrya in her own disguise and went to the forest
for tapas. Sūrya had three children by Chāyā, Śanai-
ścara, another Manu and Tapatī. This Manu is known as
Sāvarṇi who will become the eighth Manu. In his time
there will be three groups of Devas—Sutapas, Amitā-
bhas and Mukhyas. Each of these groups will consist of
twelve persons. The Saptarṣis of the eighth Manvantara
are Dīptimān, Gālava, Rāma, Kṛpa, Aśvatthāmā son
of Droṇa, Vyāsa son of Parāśara and Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.
Mahābali, son of Virocana will be the Indra. Virajas,
Urvarīyān, Nirmoka and others are the Kings who are
the sons of Sāvarṇi Manu. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III,

Vicitra and other sons of this Manu will be kings.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(14). {%Indra Sāvarṇi (Bhaumi).%}
<div n="NI"/>{%General.%} The Indra of this Manvantara will be Śuci.
Under his control there will be five groups of Devas.
They are Cākṣuṣas, Pavitras, Kaniṣṭhas, Bhrājakas and
Vācāvṛddhas. The Saptarṣis of this period are Agni-
bāhu, Śuci, Śukra, Māgadha, Agnīdhra, Yukta and
Jita. At that time the sons of the Manu who would rule
the earth will be Uru, Gambhīrabuddhi and others.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Some more details.%} Fourteen Manus have been
mentioned above. Of them, the seventh Manu, Vaivas-
vata Manu is the Head of the present Manvantrara.
Some general facts about the Manus are given below:-
<div n="NI"/>1) The six Manus after the eighth one namely,
Dakṣasāvarṇi, Merusāvarṇi, Sūryasāvarṇi, Candra-
sāvarṇī, Rudrasāvarṇi and Viṣṇusāvarṇi are
respectively the re-births of Karūṣa, Pṛṣadhra, Nābh-
āga, Diṣṭa, Śaryāti and Triśaṅku who were the
sons of Vaivasvsata Manu. There is a story about their
taking re-births. All the six persons mentioned above
were once offering worship to the idol of Devī on the
banks of the river Kālindī. After twelve years, Devī
appeared, under the name of Bhramarāmbikā and blessed
them that in their next births they would become
rulers of Manvantaras. (Devī Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) It is said that the four Manus, Svārociṣa, Uttama,
Tāmasa and Raivata belonged to Priyavrata's family.
It was because Priyavrata who was a Rājarṣi offered
tapas to Viṣṇu that four Manus were born in his family.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa. Part III, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>3) It is the power of Viṣṇu that dominates all the
Manvantaras as the basic divinity. In the first Svāyam-
bhuva Manvantara it was a part of that power of Viṣṇu
itself that originated as Yajñapuruṣa in Ābhūti. After
that when Svārociṣa Manvantara came it was again that
divinity that took its origin in Tuṣitā as Ajita among the
[Page486-a+ 64]
Tuṣitas. In Uttama Manvantara that divinity Tuṣita him
self was born again under the name of Satya as the son of
Satyā in the group of Devas called Satyas. When Tāmasa
Manvantara began, that divinity was born again as the
son of Haryā as a Hari in the group of Devas called
Haris. It was that divinity Hari himself who was born
in Sambhūti under the name of Mānasa among the
Devas called Raivatas in Raivata Manvantara. In Cākṣuṣa
Manvantara that Viṣṇu Bhagavān took birth in Vikuṇṭhī
as one of the Vaikuṇṭhas. In the present Vaivasvata
Manvantara, Viṣṇu has incarnated in Aditi as Vāmana,
the son of Kaśyapa. That great Vāmana conquered
all the three worlds and presented them to Devendra.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>Besides the fourteen Manus mentioned above, certain
other Manus are also referred to in the Purāṇas. Some
details about them are given below:—

<div n="NI"/>(3) A son named Manu was born to the Agni Tapa or
Pāñcajanya. This Manu has another name Bhānu. He
