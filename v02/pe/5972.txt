ŚAKTI III¦. The sound ‘Ś’ means welfare or prosperity
<div n="lb"/>and ‘kti’ prowess. Therefore Śakti means she, who is
<div n="lb"/>the embodiment of prosperity and prowess or she, who
<div n="lb"/>grants prosperity and prowess. The definition of
<div n="lb"/>‘Bhagavatī’ is, she who combines in herself knowledge
<div n="lb"/>affluence, wealth, reputation, power and the female
<div n="lb"/>organ. Therefore the word ‘Śakti’ may be taken to mean
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavatī and Pārvatī, and what are termed as Bhaga-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, Śakti, Devī, Ambikā, Pārvatī etc. are the mani-
<div n="lb"/>festations of Śakti, Śiva's spouse. This Śakti exists
<div n="lb"/>fractionally in all Devas. When, once upon a time the
<div n="lb"/>devāsura war broke out the Śaktis of Devas like
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā emerged to help Caṇḍikā. The vehicle, orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments, weapon etc. of each Deva, his Devī also possessed.
<div n="lb"/>The Śaktis (Devīs) of the Devas appeared in the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing manner. Brahmāṇī, wife of Brahmā, rode on the
<div n="lb"/>swan wearing beads around her neck and holding the
<div n="lb"/>water-vessel in her hands. She was followed by Vaiṣṇavī
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu's Śakti on Garuḍa wearing yellow clothes and
<div n="lb"/>with the conch, disc, lotus etc. in her hands. Śāṅkarī
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's Śakti rode on the ox with the crescent moon and
<div n="lb"/>serpents as ornaments and holding in her hands the
<div n="lb"/>Śūla. ‘Kaumārī’, Subrahmaṇya's Śakti rode on
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata with śūla in hands. The Śakti called ‘Vārāhī
<div n="lb"/>in the form of a great boar rode carrying a corpse,
<div n="lb"/>Nārasiṃhī’ Śakti took the form of narasiṃha (half man
<div n="lb"/>and half lion). Yāmyā, Yama's śakti, rode on
<div n="lb"/>buffalo holding in her hands a long stick. Śaktis
<div n="lb"/>called Kauberī and Vāruṇī took their respective forms
<div n="lb"/>and in this manner all the Śaktis came to the help
<div n="lb"/>of Devī. This sight pleased not only the Devas, but
<div n="lb"/>the mother of the universe also. Along with them in-
<div n="lb"/>carnated on earth Śaṃkara, who gives ‘śaṃ’ (happiness)
<div n="lb"/>to the world and blessed Caṇḍikā on the battle-field
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, 5th and 9th Skandhas).
