ŚIVARĀTRĪ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Śivarātrī is a holy day. Śivarātrī is observed
<div n="lb"/>on the eve of New moon day (Caturdaśī) falling in the
<div n="lb"/>middle of Māgha and Phālguna (February-March).
<div n="lb"/>During this night, penance should be done with
<div n="lb"/>fasting. On Caturdaśī day penance (vrata) should be
<div n="lb"/>observed without sleep and food and Śiva worshipped.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} There is the following Purāṇic story about
<div n="lb"/>the origin of the observance of Śivarātri as a sacred day.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā took his birth in the lotus that originated from
<div n="lb"/>the navel of Viṣṇu. Brahmā trying to know the source
<div n="lb"/>of the lotus saw Viṣṇu only. He asked, ‘Who are you?’
<div n="lb"/>and was answered ‘I am Viṣṇu, your father’. That
<div n="lb"/>answer did not satisfy Brahmā and a quarrel ensued
<div n="lb"/>between him and Viṣṇu which ended in fighting.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā shot the Brahmāstra, which Viṣṇu countered
<div n="lb"/>with Pāśupatāstra and neither of the two was able to
<div n="lb"/>withdraw it, which went round the world. While both
<div n="lb"/>stood aghast not knowing what to do, Śivaliṅga appeared
<div n="lb"/>betwixt the two. Both the ends of the liṅga were invisi-
<div n="lb"/>ble. To find the ends Brahmā went upwards and Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>downwards. Though they travelled a great distance
<div n="lb"/>they could not find out the ends, and, so, returned to their
<div n="lb"/>old seats. Immediately Śiva appeared betwixt the two
<div n="lb"/>and withdrew the pāśupatāstra. It was on Caturdaśī day
<div n="lb"/>in the month of Māgha that Śiva thus appeared. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>enjoined that in future Caturdaśī night every year
<div n="lb"/>should be observed as a holy day, which should be
<div n="lb"/>known as Śivarātri. (Kaṇṇaśśa Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The greatness of Śivarātri.%} The following story about
<div n="lb"/>a sinner, who attained Śivaloka by observing Śivarātri
<div n="lb"/>is related in Śivarātrimāhātmya.
<div n="NI"/>A son named Sukumāra was born to the Brahmin mana-
<div n="lb"/>ger of the king of Kuñjara, a kingdom on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>river Sindhu. The boy grew up to be an immoral fellow
<div n="lb"/>and he married a Caṇḍāla girl with whom he lived for
<div n="lb"/>seven years. Five daughters and two sons were born to
<div n="lb"/>him of the Caṇḍāla woman. The father, Sukumāra,
<div n="lb"/>himself married the daughters. One day he, in the
<div n="lb"/>course of his search for a flower to be worn on the hair
<div n="lb"/>of the Caṇḍāla woman, came near the Śiva temple cal-
<div n="lb"/>led Nāgeśvara. A Śivarātri festival was being cele-
<div n="lb"/>brated there that day and Sukumāra, participated in it.
<div n="lb"/>Shortly afterwards Sukumāra died. Messengers of Kāla
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva arrived to carry off his soul and a battle
<div n="lb"/>ensued between the two for the soul. His soul attained
<div n="lb"/>Śivaloka as he had, though by accident, participated in
<div n="lb"/>Śivarātri festival.
