BHASMĀSURA¦. A demon. There is no mention about
<div n="lb"/>this demon in any of the Sanskrit purāṇas but ‘Śivalī-
<div n="lb"/>lāmṛta’ in Marāṭhi contains the following story about
<div n="lb"/>him.
<div n="NI"/>Bhasmāsura was born of the Bhasma dust (ashes) on
<div n="lb"/>the body of Śiva. Pleased at the great devotion of the
<div n="lb"/>demon towards him Śiva asked him to name any boon
<div n="lb"/>he wanted. Bhasmāsura said that he wanted the power
<div n="lb"/>to burn to ashes anybody on whose head he placed his
<div n="lb"/>hand. Bhasmāsura became arrogant with the boon
<div n="lb"/>and he became a nightmare to the whole world. Then
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu appeared before him in the form of Mohinī,
<div n="lb"/>an attractive dancer and alluring him by her charm
<div n="lb"/>started on a dance called Muktanṛtya. During the course
<div n="lb"/>of this dance Bhasmāsura was forced to place his hand
<div n="lb"/>on his own head and the moment his head touched his
<div n="lb"/>head he was burnt to ashes.
