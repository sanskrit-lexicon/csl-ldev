VADHŪSARĀ¦. A river which flowed through the vicinity
<div n="lb"/>of the hermitage of Cyavana. This river took its origin
<div n="lb"/>from the tears of Pulomā, the wife of hermit Bhṛgu. (For
<div n="lb"/>further details see under Cyavana). Because of a bath
<div n="lb"/>taken in this river, the body of Paraśurāma shone with
<div n="lb"/>radiance. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 99, Stanza 68).
