ABHIMANYU I¦. He was the heroic son of Arjuna the cen-
<div n="lb"/>tral figure of the Mahābhārata, by his wife Subhadrā.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} He was descended from Viṣṇu in this order:
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-Nahuṣa-
<div n="lb"/>Yayāti-Pūru-Janamejaya-Prācinvā-Pravīra-Namasyu-
<div n="lb"/>Vītabhaya-Śuṇḍu-Bahuvidha-Saṃyāti-Rahovādi-Raud-
<div n="lb"/>rāśvā-Matināra-Santurodha-Duṣyanta-Bharata-Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>kṣatra-Hasti-Ajamīḍha-Ṛkṣa-Saṃvaraṇa-Kuru-Jahnu-
<div n="lb"/>Suratha-Vidūratha-Sārvabhauma-Jayatsena-Ravīya-
<div n="lb"/>Bhāvuka-Cakroddhata-Devātithi-Ṛkṣa-Bhīma-Pratīya-
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu-Vyāsa-Pāṇḍu-Arjuna-Abhimanyu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pūrvajanma (Previous Birth).%} There is a story about
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu's Pūrvajanma in the Mahābhārata. It was
<div n="lb"/>Varcas, son of Candra, who incarnated as Abhimanyu,
<div n="lb"/>son of Arjuna. A conference took place between the
<div n="lb"/>Devas and Candra about the incarnation of the Devas
<div n="lb"/>in the world for the destruction of the wicked people.
<div n="lb"/>Candra told the Devas: “I do not like to send Varcas,
<div n="lb"/>whom I love more than my life, to the earth. Still, I
<div n="lb"/>think it is not right to stand in the way of the plans of
<div n="lb"/>the gods. You must agree to one condition if I am to
<div n="lb"/>send my son. Let him be born as the son of Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>I am unable to be separated from him for more than
<div n="lb"/>sixteen years. My son will enter into the Cakra Vyūha
<div n="lb"/>of the enemies to be killed by them and return to me
<div n="lb"/>in the sixteenth year.” The devas (gods) accepted this
<div n="lb"/>condition. That is why Abhimanyu was killed in his
<div n="lb"/>sixteenth year. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Military Training and War.%} Abhimanyu received his
<div n="lb"/>training in arms from his father Arjuna. Later, he
<div n="lb"/>went with his mother Subhadrā to Dvārakā and lived
<div n="lb"/>for some time with his uncle Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There he is
<div n="lb"/>said to have received training in arms from Pradyumna,
<div n="lb"/>son of Śrī Kṛṣna. After the incognito life of the
[Page001-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas, Abhimanyu married Uttarā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>the King of Virāta. War broke out between Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>and Pāṇḍavas. On the first day itself Abhimanyu
<div n="lb"/>entered into a duel with Bṛhatbala, King of Kosala.
<div n="lb"/>In the terrible conflict with Bhīṣma, Abhimanyu broke
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma's flagstaff. After that he assisted his father Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>to fight against Bhīṣma. Verses 8-13 of Chapter 55 of
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma Parva of the Mahābhārata describe Abhi-
<div n="lb"/>manyu's fight with Lakṣmaṇa in the second day's battle.
<div n="lb"/>Then he took his place in the Ardha Candra Vyūha
<div n="lb"/>(semi-circular phalanx) formed by Arjuna. He fought
<div n="lb"/>fiercely with the Gandhāras. He attacked Śalya and kill-
<div n="lb"/>ed Jayatsena, King of Magadha, along with his elephant.
<div n="lb"/>We find Abhimanyu assisting Bhīmasena in M.B. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapters 63, 64, 69 and 94. After that
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu defeated Lakṣmaṇa in battle. Then he
<div n="lb"/>defeated Vikarṇa, Citrasena and others also. Later he
<div n="lb"/>took his position in the Śṛṅgāṭaka Vyūha created by
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛṣṭadyumna. He started fighting with Bhagadatta.
<div n="lb"/>He defeated Aṃbaṣṭha and Alaṃbuṣa. Next he fought a
<div n="lb"/>duel with Sudīṣṇa. After that he encountered Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana, Bṛhatbala and others. M.B. Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 10, Verses 47-52 are a description of Abhi-
<div n="lb"/>manyu's heroism by Dhṛtarāṣṭra. He snatched Paurava's
<div n="lb"/>weapon and threw it on the ground. Next he fought
<div n="lb"/>with Jayadratha and Śalya. Then he was caught in the
<div n="lb"/>Cakra Vyūha (circular phalanx) of the enemies.
<div n="lb"/>There he inflicted great losses upon the enemy forces.
<div n="lb"/>Śalya was stunned and his brother was killed by
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu. M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 38, Verses 23
<div n="lb"/>and 24 describe the flight of the Kauravas in fear. At
<div n="lb"/>this stage, even Droṇācārya praised Abhimanyu's
<div n="lb"/>valour. Duśśāsana fainted during his fight with Abhi-
<div n="lb"/>manyu. Karṇa was defeated. Vṛṣasena, Satyaśravas
<div n="lb"/>and Śalya's son, Rugmaratha were slain. Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>fled. Lakṣmaṇa was killed. Vṛndāraka, Aśvatthāmā,
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa and others were amazed by this terrible valour
<div n="lb"/>of Abhimanyu. Six ministers of Karṇa were slain.
<div n="lb"/>Next, Aśvaketu, son of the King of Magadha was
<div n="lb"/>killed. King Bhoja was also killed. Śalya was again
<div n="lb"/>defeated. Śatruñjaya, Candraketu, Meghavega, Suvarcas,
<div n="lb"/>Sūryabhāsa—who were all kings—were beheaded by
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu. Śakuni was wounded by Abhimanyu's
<div n="lb"/>arrow. Kālakeya, son of Subala was slain. M.B. Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 40, Verses 13 and 14 say that at this
<div n="lb"/>stage, Prince Duśśāsana beat Abhimanyu to death with
<div n="lb"/>his mace.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%After Death.%} M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 71, Verses
<div n="lb"/>12-16 say that after death Abhimanyu attained the
<div n="lb"/>immortal world of the Munis (Saints). King Parīkṣit
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Abhimanyu. In M.B. Svargārohaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 5, Verses 18-20, we find that after his
<div n="lb"/>death, Abhimanyu entered the moon in his former form
<div n="lb"/>of Varcas.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other names of Abhimanyu.%} In the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu has been referred to by several other names,
<div n="lb"/>such as ĀRJUNI, Saubhadra, Kārṣṇī, Arjunātmaja,
<div n="lb"/>Śukrātmajātmaja, Arjunāpara and Phālguni.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%} King Parīkṣit was the son of Abhi-
<div n="lb"/>manyu. Janamejaya was born as his son. It was Janame-

<div n="lb"/>In the Bhāgavata the number mentioned is seven; but in the Malayalam version of the Bhāgavata (By Ramanujan Eluttacchan)
<div n="lb"/>the number is eight. The original Bhāgavata says: “Śivaṃ Yamasaṃ. Subhadraṃ, Śāntaṃ, Kṣemaṃ, Amṛtaṃ Abhayam iti
<div n="lb"/>Varṣāni teṣu girayo nadyaśca saptaivabhijñātāḥ”. In the Malayalam Bhāgavata an eighth division called Śivadaṃ is seen.</F>

<div n="lb"/>jaya who performed Sarpasatra. (A yāga) Śatānīka was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Janamejaya. Śatānīka had a son named
<div n="lb"/>Sahasrānīka. King Udayana, the jewel of the Candra
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśa (Lunar dynasty) was born to Sahasrānīka by
<div n="lb"/>the goddess Mṛgāvatī (See ‘Udayana’, stories about
<div n="lb"/>this Udayana are very famous. Kālidāsa has mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in his “Meghadūta” about the old rustics who thronged
<div n="lb"/>the country-sides to tell and listen to Udayana stories).
