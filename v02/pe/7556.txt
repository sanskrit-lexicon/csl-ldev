ṬIṬṬIBHASARAS¦. A sacred pond near the āśrama of
Vālmīki. There is a story about this pond. Once
a water-fowl lived there with his mate. One day
the male fowl went out for food and as he was
returning home he found a few other water-fowls going
that way and the male fowl suspected the chastity of his
wife. The male fowl decided to abandon his mate and
the innocent shefowl prayed to the Aṣṭadikpālakas for
help. The Aṣṭadikpālakas instantly appeared there and
made a pond and said that if the she-fowl could reach
from one shore to the other without getting herself
drowned she must be treated as chaste. The she-fowl
was accordingly put into the waters and asked to swim
to the other shore which she did without any accident.
From that day onwards the poṇd was called Ṭiṭṭibha-
saras. (Tiṭṭibha = water fowl. Saras = pond).
<div n="NI"/>When Sītā came to the āśrama of Vālmīki after being
abandoned by Śrī Rāma, Vālmīki wanted to test her
chastity. So the sages asked Sītā to enter the pond and
reach the other shore. “Oh goddess of Earth, if even in
[Page791-a+ 64]
my dreams no other person than my husband has
entered my thoughts, let me reach the other shore safe.”
So saying Sītā entered the water and the goddess of
Earth placed her in her lap and took her to the other
shore. Sītā did not get even wet. All the sages called her
‘Mahāsādhvī’ meaning supremely chaste woman.
