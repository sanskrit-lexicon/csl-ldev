AGNIŚAUCA¦(M). A cloak with magical properties
<div n="lb"/>given to Nala by the serpent, Kārkoṭaka. After separat-
<div n="lb"/>ing himself from Damayantī, Nala was wandering in
<div n="lb"/>the forest. Then he was bitten by the poisonous serpent,
<div n="lb"/>Kārkoṭaka. This deformed Nala beyond recognition.
<div n="lb"/>Then the serpent gave him this shawl (Agniśauca).
<div n="lb"/>Anybody who wore that cloak would regain his original
<div n="lb"/>form and colour. (Kathāsaritsāgara-Alaṅkāravatī-lam-
<div n="lb"/>baka-Taraṅga 6).
