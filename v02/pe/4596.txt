MŪKA II¦. An asura. This demon once went to
Arjuna who was engaged in penance in the forests. He
had assumed the form of a boar and Arjuna killed
him. At once Śiva appeared there in the guise of a
forester and contended that the boar was killed by him.
A quarrel ensued which ended in a fight between
them. In the end Śiva appeared before Arjuna in his
real form and granted him the missile Pāśupata. (See
under Arjuna).
