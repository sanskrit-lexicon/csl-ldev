KABANDHA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The demon who attacked Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa while they were wandering in Daṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>kāraṇya after the abduction of Sītā by Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous history of Kabandha.%} There was a King of Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharvas called Śrī. He had a son named Danu. Danu
<div n="lb"/>was known as Viśvāvasu also. Viśvāvasu once per-
<div n="lb"/>formed a penance to propitiate Brahmā for long life
<div n="lb"/>and Brahmā appeared before him and blessed him with
<div n="lb"/>immortality. Arrogant of this acquisition he roamed
<div n="lb"/>about as he pleased.
<div n="NI"/>One day he attacked Indra and the latter furious at his
<div n="lb"/>impudence used the Vajrāyudha on him and the head
<div n="lb"/>and thighs of Viśvāvasu were squeezed into his body.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāvasu pleaded that he should be given some way
<div n="lb"/>to take his food. Indra then granted him two very long
<div n="lb"/>hands and a mouth on his belly. Then Viśvāvasu spent
<div n="lb"/>his days in a forest near the Mataṅgāśrama in Krauñ-
<div n="lb"/>cāraṇya bearing the name Kabandha (Headless trunk).
<div n="lb"/>Indra added that he would attain his real form when
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa cut his hands.
<F>1) “I am the son of Śrī named Danu” says Kabandha to Lakṣmaṇa in Śloka 8, Chapter 71, of the Araṇya Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa. In Śloka 42, Chapter 279 of Araṇya Kāṇda, Kabandha says, “I am a gandharva, Viśvāvasu and came to be born in a demonaic
<div n="lb"/>womb by the curse of a brahmin.”</F>
<div n="NI"/>A favourite pastime of Kabandha was to frighten the
<div n="lb"/>sages. One day he attacked a sage called Sthūlaśiras
<div n="lb"/>and that sage cursed him saying that he would retain
<div n="lb"/>his ugly figure for ever. The demon pleaded for relief
<div n="lb"/>and the sage said that he would regain his original
<div n="lb"/>figure when Rāma cut his hands and left him in the
<div n="lb"/>desolate forest. From that day onwards Kabandha
<div n="lb"/>lived there waiting for Śrī Rāma. (Sarga 70, Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kabandha meets Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.%} Jaṭāyu was
<div n="lb"/>lying half dead by a blow from the sword of Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went to him and talked to
<div n="lb"/>him. He gave them some information regarding Sītā
<div n="lb"/>before he died. After burning the body of Jaṭāyu in a
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went westwards.
<div n="lb"/>They entered the Krauñcāraṇya and reached Mataṅga-
<div n="lb"/>vana. There they saw a great cave. A huge demoness
<div n="lb"/>attacked them near that cave and seeing the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>form of Lakṣmaṇa she invited him for amorous plays.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa cut off her ear, nose and breasts. Then they
<div n="lb"/>entered deep into the forests. Bad omens greeted them.
[Page362-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Before long they saw Kabandha rushing towards them.
<div n="lb"/>He is described thus in the Mahābhārata:
<div n="NI"/>“He was as big as a mountain, dark as a black cloud,
<div n="lb"/>with pointed hairs all over his body and looked fierce
<div n="lb"/>with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his
<div n="lb"/>stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a
<div n="lb"/>fire-flame. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out
<div n="lb"/>of his huge mouth licking the sides.”
<div n="NI"/>The demon stretched out his big hands and caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of Śrī Rāma in his right hand and Lakṣmaṇa in
<div n="lb"/>his left hand. Finding themselves helpless in his hands
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa implored Rāma to flee away from the
<div n="lb"/>demon leaving him alone. Śrī Rāma cut off Kabandha's
<div n="lb"/>right hand and Lakṣmaṇa cut off the left hand.
<div n="lb"/>Kabandha then asked them who they were. Kabandha
<div n="lb"/>told Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa his previous story and then
<div n="lb"/>fell dead. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa burnt the dead body in
<div n="lb"/>a funeral pyre. He rose up in the air as the Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>King of old and advised Śrī Rāma to go to Sugrīva for
<div n="lb"/>knowing more about Sītā. (Sargas 70 to 72, Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
