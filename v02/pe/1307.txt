BṚHADDHVAJA¦. A Rākṣasa (giant). This giant wan-
<div n="lb"/>dered about stealing the wealth and women of others.
<div n="lb"/>One day Bṛhaddhvaja happened to meet with Keśinī,
<div n="lb"/>the beautiful wife of king Bhīmakeśa. The lustful giant
<div n="lb"/>was about to take her away, when she told him
<div n="lb"/>thus:—“I hate my husband very much. So I am
<div n="lb"/>ready to come with you, of my own accord.”
<div n="NI"/>Taking her in his chariot the giant went to Gaṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara saṅgama. When she learned that this place was
<div n="lb"/>under the rule of her husband, she died of fear. Being
<div n="lb"/>unable to bear separation from Keśinī, the giant also
<div n="lb"/>died. As these two had died at the holy place of Gaṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara saṅgama, both attained the world of Viṣṇu.
