MĀDHAVA II¦. Son of Vikrama, King of Tāladhvaja.
<div n="lb"/>The Kriyā Khaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa gives the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing story about him.
<div n="NI"/>Mādhava desired to marry a beautiful and good-natur-
<div n="lb"/>ed Kṣatriya girl named Candrakalā. She was not
[Page459-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>prepared for that and she informed Mādhava thus:
<div n="lb"/>“There is a princess in the island of Plakṣa named
<div n="lb"/>Sulocanā. She is far more beautiful than myself and
<div n="lb"/>is fit to be your consort. Do try to get her.”
<div n="NI"/>Mādhava accepted the advice of Candrakalā and
<div n="lb"/>started for the island of Plakṣa with a servant of his
<div n="lb"/>named Praceṣṭa. The news that welcomed him when he
<div n="lb"/>reached the island was that the marriage of Sulocanā
<div n="lb"/>had been fixed with one Vidyādhara. Undaunted
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava sent a love-letter to the princess mentioning
<div n="lb"/>his arrival in the city, seeking her hand in marriage.
<div n="lb"/>In reply to that Sulocanā wrote that if Mādhava appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed on the marriage-dais in time she would accept him as
<div n="lb"/>her husband.
<div n="NI"/>The marriage day arrived and Mādhava waited for the
<div n="lb"/>time of the function. But when the auspicious hour
<div n="lb"/>came Mādhava was asleep. Praceṣṭa, his servant, took
<div n="lb"/>advantage of the opportunity and carried away Sulo-
<div n="lb"/>canā. But Sulocanā was determined to marry only
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava and she escaped from the custody of Praceṣṭa
<div n="lb"/>and reached the palace of a King called Suṣeṇa and
<div n="lb"/>stayed there as a servant wearing the robes of a male,
<div n="lb"/>calling himself Vīravara.
<div n="NI"/>Vīravara, i. e. Sulocanā in disguise, saved Vidyādhara
<div n="lb"/>and Praceṣṭa from committing suicide. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava also in despair was about to commit suicide
<div n="lb"/>when Sulocanā appeared before him in time and stopped
<div n="lb"/>him from doing it. Sulocanā then told him all that had
<div n="lb"/>happened and they were happily united as husband and
<div n="lb"/>wife.
