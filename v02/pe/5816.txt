RUDRA¦. A form of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The birth of Rudra is from
Brahmā. Even before the creation of the Prajāpatis,
Brahmā had created Sanandana, Sanaka, Sanātana and
Sanatkumāra. These four were not desirous of mundane
pleasures and were not prepared to beget children.
They were great sages and scholars, of abstinence and
without any discord and animosity. When these four
showed no interest at all in the creation of the world,
Brahmā became angry to such an extent that he was
prepared to destroy the three worlds. At that time the
whole of the three worlds shone in the radiance that
emanated from the fire of the fury of Brahmā. Then
from his shining eyebrows which were curved with fury,
a figure of unbearable radiance like the mid-day sun
came out. That figure was Rudra. Half of the fierce
body of that Rudra who was very furious, was a woman
and the other half was a man. Brahmā, saying, “Divide
body”, disappeared. Instantly Rudra split himself into
the figure of a man and the figure of a woman. He
again divided the body of the man into eleven parts.
These eleven figures are the eleven Rudras.
<div n="NI"/>The names of the eleven Rudras are given differently
in different Purāṇas. In a text it is said that the eleven
Rudras are, Manyu, Manu, Mahīnasa, Mahān, Śiva, Ṛtu-
dhvaja, Ugraretas, Bhava, Kāma, Vāmadeva and Dhṛta-
vrata. According to some other Purāṇas, the eleven
Rudras are Aja, Ekapāda (Ekapāt), Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā,
Rudra, Hara, Śambhu, Tryambaka, Aparājita, Īśāna
and Tribhuvana. Brahmā apportioned to the eleven
Rudras the eleven positions of the heart, the five organs
of senses and the organs of action and to Rudra
the eight positions of life, ether, air, fire, water, earth,
the sun and the moon. It was said before that Rudra
was divided into man and woman. From the woman-
portion eleven Rudrāṇīs came into being. They were
Dhī, Vṛtti, Uśanā, Umā, Niyutā, Sarpis, Ilā, Ambikā,
Irāvatī, Sudhā and Dīkṣā. The eleven Rudraṇīs became
the wives of the eleven Rudras. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1.
Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other information regarding Rudra.%} Details about
the orgin, life, character etc. of Rudra which occur in
other Purāṇas are given below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Thirtythree children were born to Prajāpati Kaśya-
pa, by his wife Aditi, as Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras and
Aśvins. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Sarga 14).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) From the fury of Brahmā, Rudra was born; from
the lap of Brahmā, Nārada was born; from the right
thumb, Dakṣa; from the mind, Sanaka and the others;
and from the left thumb, a daughter named Vīraṇī was
born. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In the beginning of Kalpa (Age of Brahmā)
Brahmā meditated upon getting a child like himself
and a child of blue complexion appeared on his lap.
He ran here and there crying aloud. Brahmā asked him
“Why are you crying?” He replied: “I must be named.”
Because he was crying (doing rodana) Brahmā
named him Rudra (He who cries). He cried seven times
more. Brahmā gave him seven more names. They
were Bhava, Śarva, Īśāna, Paśupati, Bhīma, Ugra and
Mahādeva. Thus there were eight Rudras. To each of
them, Brahmā gave a position and wives and children.
[Page655-a+ 65]
The Sun, water, earth, air, fire, ether, Brahmin who
has taken vow and the moon were allotted to them as
their positions and figures. Their wives were Suvarcalā,
Uṣā, Vikeśī Śivā, Svāhā, Dīśā, Dīkṣā and Rohiṇī.
This world is filled by the sons and grandsons and so on
of these wives. Their sons respectively were Śanaiścara
Śukra, Lohitāṅga, Manojava, Skanda, Sarga, Santāna
and Budha. This Rudra who is described above,
married Satī the daughter of Prajāpati Dakṣa. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 8). (For further information
