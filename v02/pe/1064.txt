<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Daśaratha, King of Ayodhyā, had three wives:
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā, Kaikeyī and Sumitrā. Kausalyā gave birth
<div n="lb"/>to Śrī Rāma, Kaikeyī to Bharata and Sumitrā to
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna. Kaikeyī, mother of Bharata,
<div n="lb"/>was the sister of Yudhājit, Rājā of Kekeya. Bharata
<div n="lb"/>was born on the day of Pūya. (Śloka 14, Sarga 18,
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa)
<div n="NI"/>Daśaratha remained in sorrow without children for a
<div n="lb"/>very long time and then he performed a Putrakāmeṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>yāga (A sacrificial ceremony to get children) with
<div n="lb"/>the Maharṣi Ṛṣyaśṛṅga as the officiating priest. From
<div n="lb"/>the sacred fire arose a divine figure carrying a pot of
<div n="lb"/>pudding and it was after taking that pudding that the
<div n="lb"/>wives of Daśaratha became pregnant. (Sarga 15,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Till the end of Śrī Rāma's forest life.%} The sons of
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha married the daughters of Janaka, King of
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā. Śrī Rāma married Sītā, Bharata, Māṇḍavī,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa, Ūrmilā and Śatrughna, Śrutakīrtī.
<div n="NI"/>Daśaratha made arrangements to crown Rāma as King
<div n="lb"/>and then leave for the forests and lead an ascetic life.
<div n="lb"/>At that time Bharata and Śatrughna were in the
<div n="lb"/>country of Kekaya with their uncle, Yudhājit. When
<div n="lb"/>the day of coronation was drawing near Kaikeyī
<div n="lb"/>demanded of Daśaratha the execution of two boons
<div n="lb"/>which were once promised by Daśaratha to her long
<div n="lb"/>ago during a battle between the devas and asuras. One
<div n="lb"/>of them was to crown her son, Bharata, as king and the
<div n="lb"/>other to send Rāma to the forests for a period of
<div n="lb"/>fourteen years. Daśaratha was shocked to hear that.
<div n="lb"/>But, without any hesitation, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by Sītā went to the forests and Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>overcome with immense grief caused by this unplea-
<div n="lb"/>sant turn of events fell down dead. Messengers were
<div n="lb"/>sent then to Kekaya to bring Bharata and after travel-
<div n="lb"/>ling for three days Bharata and Śatrughṇa reached
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā. Though they were not informed of the death
<div n="lb"/>of their father they were worried all the way because
<div n="lb"/>of the several bad omens which they saw. On entering
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā they were shocked to find all the roads deso-
<div n="lb"/>late and arriving at the palace they found it silent and
<div n="lb"/>gloomy. Kaikeyī then told him all that had happened
<div n="lb"/>and when Bharata knew that his mother was at the
<div n="lb"/>root of all this calamity his rage knew no bounds.
<div n="lb"/>Forgetting himself he drew from the sheath the glitter-
<div n="lb"/>ing sword and stood before his mother with the drawn
<div n="lb"/>sword wavering to strike or not to strike and mused to
<div n="lb"/>himself “No, Not a woman and not one's own mother,
<div n="lb"/>No, it should not be done”. Immediately after this was
<div n="lb"/>decided, he swung the sword straight to his throat.
<div n="lb"/>But adroitly Śatrughna intervened and swept away the
<div n="lb"/>sword before it fell at its aim. This strong move of
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna brought Bharata to his senses and he looked
<div n="lb"/>at his mother so fiendishly that at his stare his mother
<div n="lb"/>turned pale like a flower brought near a burning flame.
<div n="lb"/>Bharata immediately changed into the dress of a
<div n="lb"/>Sannyāsī and started to go to the forests. Śatrughna
<div n="lb"/>followed his brother. Vasiṣṭha also started. The news
<div n="lb"/>spread like wildfire and people began to crowd at the
<div n="lb"/>palace eager to follow the brothers. Very soon a huge
<div n="lb"/>procession was seen moving towards the forests. Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>and Arundhatī in a chariot in the front, Kausalyā and
<div n="lb"/>Sumitrā in another next to it and Bharata and Śatru-
<div n="lb"/>ghna closely following the chariots, walking. People
<div n="lb"/>joined the procession from behind. The great crowd
<div n="lb"/>of people reached the banks of the river Gaṅgā. Guha
<div n="lb"/>coming to know of the great exile of people from
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā through spies went and saw Bharata, at first
<div n="lb"/>in disguise, and later as himself made his acquaintance.
<div n="lb"/>He then took Bharata and Śatrughna across the river
<div n="lb"/>to the presence of Śri Rāma at Citrakūṭa.
<div n="NI"/>When they reached Citrakūṭa only Bharata-Śatrughna,
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and Arundhatī, Kausalyā and Sumitrā entered
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama of Śrī Rāma, all the others remaining out-
<div n="lb"/>side. When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were told about the
<div n="lb"/>death of their father they were filled with grief. All the
<div n="lb"/>sons, then, Vasiṣṭha officiating, performed the obsequies
<div n="lb"/>of their father. Rāma and Bharata then discussed the
<div n="lb"/>future. Śrī Rāma persisted in his vow and said he
<div n="lb"/>would return to his country only after fourteen years
[Page119-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and insisted that Bharata should rule the country
<div n="lb"/>during that period. Bharata accepted the arrangement
<div n="lb"/>saying that if his brother did not come back after four-
<div n="lb"/>teen years he would give up his life by jumping into
<div n="lb"/>the fire. Śrī Rāma then gave his sandals to Bharata who
<div n="lb"/>accepting the same with due respect returned home
<div n="lb"/>followed by others. On reaching Ayodhyā Bharata did
<div n="lb"/>not go to the royal palace which he considered as empty
<div n="lb"/>because of the absence of his brother, Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>abhorrent because of the presence of his mother, Kaikeyī.
<div n="lb"/>Instead, he went to a nearby village called Nandi and
<div n="lb"/>installing the sandals there lived there and ruled the
<div n="lb"/>country.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Return of Śrī Rāma.%} Śrī Rāma when he came back
<div n="lb"/>to Ayodhyā after fourteen years was crowned King.
<div n="lb"/>Bharata got two sons of his wife Māṇḍavī, Subāhu and
<div n="lb"/>Śūrasena. While they were thus living happily in
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā, message was sent through an ascetic by
<div n="lb"/>Yudhājit from Kekaya that some gandharvas were
<div n="lb"/>creating trouble in that country. It was the state of
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu in Kekaya which was subjected to this
<div n="lb"/>molestation and on the advice of Rāma Bharata went
<div n="lb"/>and subdued the trouble, killing the gandharvas. He
<div n="lb"/>then created two small states on either side of Sindhu
<div n="lb"/>and made his two sons the Kings of those states.
<div n="lb"/>When Śrī Rāma gave up his life in Sarayū river and
<div n="lb"/>rose to heaven as Viṣṇu Bharata and Śatrughna also
<div n="lb"/>gave up their lives and took the forms of the conch
<div n="lb"/>and the wheel which adorn the hands of Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
