KĀVERĪ¦. A holy river in South India. Famous sacred
<div n="lb"/>places like Śrīraṅga and Kumbhakoṇa are on its banks.
<div n="lb"/>The Devī of the river lives in Varuṇa's assembly
<div n="lb"/>worshipping him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 20).
<div n="lb"/>The Skanda Purāṇa has the following story as to how
<div n="lb"/>Kāverī came down to earth:
<div n="lb"/>Once Agastya propitiated Śiva at Kailāsa and sought
<div n="lb"/>the boon of some water for him to found a sacred place
<div n="lb"/>on earth. At the same time Kāverī also was worship-
<div n="lb"/>ping Śiva. Śiva filled Agastya's bowl with Kāverī water.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya, on his way back from Kailāsa cursed the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa called Krauñca and kicked the Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>mountain down. (See under Agastya). After over-
<div n="lb"/>coming various difficulties Agastya at last reached
<div n="lb"/>South India. He sat in meditation with the bowl of
<div n="lb"/>Kāverī water before him, and then, at the request of
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Gaṇapati, in the guise of a crow came and sat
<div n="lb"/>on the brink of the bowl and upset it. The water in
<div n="lb"/>the bowl flowed as a river, and that river is the
<div n="lb"/>present Kāverī. (Asurakāṇḍa, Skanda Purāṇa).
