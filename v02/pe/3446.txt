KĀVERĪ¦. A holy river in South India. Famous sacred
places like Śrīraṅga and Kumbhakoṇa are on its banks.
The Devī of the river lives in Varuṇa's assembly
worshipping him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 20).
The Skanda Purāṇa has the following story as to how
Kāverī came down to earth:
Once Agastya propitiated Śiva at Kailāsa and sought
the boon of some water for him to found a sacred place
on earth. At the same time Kāverī also was worship-
ping Śiva. Śiva filled Agastya's bowl with Kāverī water.
Agastya, on his way back from Kailāsa cursed the
Rākṣasa called Krauñca and kicked the Vindhya
mountain down. (See under Agastya). After over-
coming various difficulties Agastya at last reached
South India. He sat in meditation with the bowl of
Kāverī water before him, and then, at the request of
Indra, Gaṇapati, in the guise of a crow came and sat
on the brink of the bowl and upset it. The water in
the bowl flowed as a river, and that river is the
present Kāverī. (Asurakāṇḍa, Skanda Purāṇa).
