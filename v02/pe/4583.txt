MṚTASAÑJĪVANĪ¦. This is a medicinal herb to give
<div n="lb"/>life to those who are dead. When in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>battle Lakṣmaṇa and others fell dead, Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>wanted Mṛtasañjīvanī to be brought to revive them
<div n="lb"/>back to life. Jāmbavān the oldest among the monkey-
<div n="lb"/>warriors then instructed Hanūmān to get it from the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Mahāmeru explaining to him the way to
<div n="lb"/>reach there. He said: “If you go a hundred yojanas
<div n="lb"/>(1200 Kilometres) from here to the north you would
<div n="lb"/>reach Rāmeśvara the southernmost point of Bhārata.
<div n="lb"/>From there if you go to the north another thousand
<div n="lb"/>yojanas you would reach the Himālayas which is the
<div n="lb"/>northern-most point of Bhārata. Himavān is thousand
<div n="lb"/>yojanas high, two thousand yojanas wide and is
<div n="lb"/>long enough to reach the two oceans on the east and
<div n="lb"/>the west.
<div n="NI"/>On that mountain is the marriage-dais of Pārvatī and
<div n="lb"/>Parameśvara and you will find places where Parameś-
<div n="lb"/>vara had sat for practising penances. On the northern
<div n="lb"/>side under a big Kūvala tree lies Kāmadhenu. This
<div n="lb"/>cow gives milk to the sages and tourists who go there.
[Page506-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Nine thousand yojanas to the north of this there are
<div n="lb"/>two mountains named Hemakūṭa and Ratnakūṭa. The
<div n="lb"/>centre of that is Ṛṣabhavarṣa. On a big Kāraskara
<div n="lb"/>tree there will be hanging a king with his face down-
<div n="lb"/>wards after being cursed by the sage Durvāsas. He
<div n="lb"/>will be released from the curse by you. If one eats the
<div n="lb"/>fruits of this tree one will be free from greying of hairs
<div n="lb"/>and rugosity.
<div n="NI"/>If you go farther north from Hemakūṭa you will reach
<div n="lb"/>the mountain Niṣadha. There is a lake there. If one
<div n="lb"/>bathes there one will be granted all prosperity by
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmīdevī. Farther to the north is situated Mahāmeru.
<div n="lb"/>The greatness of this mountain is indescribable.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāmeru has got four supporting mountain pillars
<div n="lb"/>named Mandara, Merumandara, Supārśva and
<div n="lb"/>Kumuda. The abode of the three deities is on the top
<div n="lb"/>of this mountain. On a peak in the centre is living
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā with his wives Vāṇī, Gāyatrī and Sāvitrī as
<div n="lb"/>creator of the universe. This place is called Satyaloka
<div n="lb"/>and to the west of it is Śrī Vaikuṇṭha the abode of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. Mādevī and Bhūdevī are his two wives.
<div n="lb"/>He is the god who protects us all. To the east of
<div n="lb"/>Satyaloka is Kailāsa, the abode of Śiva. He lives there
<div n="lb"/>with his wives Gaṅgā and Pārvatī and sons Gaṇeśa
<div n="lb"/>and Śubrahmaṇya. To the south of Satyaloka is the
<div n="lb"/>city Saṃyamanī the abode of Yamadharmarāja. He
<div n="lb"/>lives there with his wife Kālinī and sons Viḍava,
<div n="lb"/>Mahimā and Dīpaka. To the east of this is the wonder-
<div n="lb"/>ful Devaloka. There lives Indra, his wife Śacīdevī and
<div n="lb"/>son Jayanta with thirtythree crores of Devas. Celestial
<div n="lb"/>nymphs like Urvaśī, Rambhā and Tilottamā live there.
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenu, the Kalpa tree, Airāvata, Uccaiśśravas,
<div n="lb"/>and Cintāmaṇi are all there. You will find Amarāvatī
<div n="lb"/>the Capital of Indra and Sudharmā his court there.
<div n="NI"/>On the northern side of Meru is a tall Aśvattha tree.
<div n="lb"/>To the north of that is the Nīla-mahāgiri (the great
<div n="lb"/>blue mountain). Kaśyapa has installed a deity named
<div n="lb"/>Śvetavarāhamūrti there. Beyond that is the Ṛṣabhādri
<div n="lb"/>(ox-shaped mountain). It is believed that a divine ox
<div n="lb"/>became a mountain there. Its two horns are like two
<div n="lb"/>peaks. This mountain contains many divine medicines
<div n="lb"/>of which Śalyaharaṇī, Viśalyakaraṇī, Sandhānakaraṇī
<div n="lb"/>and Mṛtasañjīvanī are the most important.
<div n="NI"/>Once the asuras defeated the Devas. Then Parameś-
<div n="lb"/>vara and Mahāviṣṇu gave the Devas these four
<div n="lb"/>medicinal herbs. They planted them here and watered
<div n="lb"/>them from the Milk-sea. Around these precious plants
<div n="lb"/>stand guard the pārṣadas of Śiva and the Discus
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana of Viṣṇu.” (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>There is another statement in the Mahābhārata that
<div n="lb"/>Sañjīvanī is an art, the use of a mantra. Śukrācārya
<div n="lb"/>by this art brought to life all the asuras killed in a war
<div n="lb"/>with the devas. (Śloka 8, Chapter 76, Ādi Parva).
<div n="lb"/>Again Śukrācārya brought to life three times his dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciple Kaca whom the asuras killed three times. Śukrā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya taught the art to Kaca. (Śloka 28, Chapter 76,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva).
