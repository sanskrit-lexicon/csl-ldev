DHARMĀKARA¦. A righteous house-holder. Once a
prince entrusted his beautiful wife with Dharmākara
and went away. Though she lived with him for six
months he did not have any kind of contact with her.
The prince returned. Wicked people tried to arouse
doubts about the chastity of his wife and the house-
holder. But it was futile. Still fearing calumny Dharmā-
kara entered fire. In that test by fire he came out victo-
rious. Not only did his body remain unscorched, but
also that the faces of the wicked people who blamed
him were filled with leprosy and became ugly. (Padma
Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi khaṇḍa, Chapter 50).
