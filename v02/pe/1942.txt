DHARMĀKARA¦. A righteous house-holder. Once a
<div n="lb"/>prince entrusted his beautiful wife with Dharmākara
<div n="lb"/>and went away. Though she lived with him for six
<div n="lb"/>months he did not have any kind of contact with her.
<div n="lb"/>The prince returned. Wicked people tried to arouse
<div n="lb"/>doubts about the chastity of his wife and the house-
<div n="lb"/>holder. But it was futile. Still fearing calumny Dharmā-
<div n="lb"/>kara entered fire. In that test by fire he came out victo-
<div n="lb"/>rious. Not only did his body remain unscorched, but
<div n="lb"/>also that the faces of the wicked people who blamed
<div n="lb"/>him were filled with leprosy and became ugly. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi khaṇḍa, Chapter 50).
