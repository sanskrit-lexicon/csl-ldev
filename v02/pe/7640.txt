TUṢĀRA¦. A place of habitation of ancient Bhārata.
Scholars are of opinion that the present Tukhāristan
was the ancient Tuṣāra. The people of this place used
to be called Tuṣāras and their King Tuṣāra. The King
of Tuṣāra was the store-keeper during the Rājasūyayajña
of Yudhiṣṭhira, (Chapter 51, Vana Parva). The
Pāṇḍavas during their exile crossed this country of
Tuṣāra on their way to Dvaitavana from the mountain
of Gandhamādana. During the great battle, the Tuṣā-
ras arrayed themselves on the right side of the Krauñca
Vyūha (an army formation in the shape of a stork)
constructed by Bhīṣma. (Śloka 21, Chapter 75, Bhīṣma
Parva). There is a statement in Chapter 65 of Śānti
Parva that a barbarous tribe called Tuṣāras lived in
the country of Māndhātā.
