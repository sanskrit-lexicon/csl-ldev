MĀṆḌAKARṆI¦ (ŚĀTAKARṆI). A sage. Once this
sage spent ten thousand years in a pond performing
penance. Devas were bewildered and they sent five
beautiful celestial maidens to divert the attention of
the sage from his severe austerities. They enticed him
and the sage constructed a grand and palatial house
for them and stayed there with them. There was
always music and dance there. The pond was there-
after known as ‘Pañcāpsaras’. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
during their exile in the forests with Sītā visited this
place. (Sarga 11, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
