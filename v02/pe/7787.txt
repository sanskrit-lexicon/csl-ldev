UṢĀ II¦. The daughter of a hermit. The king of Śālva
once attacked Satyaratha, the king of Vidarbha, and
killed him. The queens of the king of Vidarbha went
to the forest. One of them who was pregnant gave
birth to a child on the bank of a river. When she got
down into the river to drink water, a crocodile swal-
lowed her. Then a hermit's daughter named Uṣā brought
up the child. (Śiva Purāṇa).
