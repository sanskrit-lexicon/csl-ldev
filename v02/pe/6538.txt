SĀVITRA III¦. A lofty peak of the mountain Sumeru.
Jyotiṣka is another name of this peak, which is
not approachable. It is adorned with precious stones
and is glorified by all. Śiva and Pārvatī once sat on
this peak and did penance. It was on this peak that
Devī Gaṅgā did penance to Śiva, assuming a divine
figure. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 283, Verse 5).
