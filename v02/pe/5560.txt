PUṢPADANTĪ¦. A relative of a Gandharva named
Citrasena. Puṣpadantī was once dancing in the court
of Indra with Mālyavān and other Gandharvas. Puṣpa-
dantī faltered in her steps as she was admiring the beauty
of Mālyavān and Indra cursed them both and turned
them into devils. They then observed the Ekādaśī (ele-
venth day of every lunar fortnight) called ‘Jaya and
got themselves released from the curse. (Chapter 43,
Uttara Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
