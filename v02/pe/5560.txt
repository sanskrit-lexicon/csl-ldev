PUṢPADANTĪ¦. A relative of a Gandharva named
<div n="lb"/>Citrasena. Puṣpadantī was once dancing in the court
<div n="lb"/>of Indra with Mālyavān and other Gandharvas. Puṣpa-
<div n="lb"/>dantī faltered in her steps as she was admiring the beauty
<div n="lb"/>of Mālyavān and Indra cursed them both and turned
<div n="lb"/>them into devils. They then observed the Ekādaśī (ele-
<div n="lb"/>venth day of every lunar fortnight) called ‘Jaya and
<div n="lb"/>got themselves released from the curse. (Chapter 43,
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
