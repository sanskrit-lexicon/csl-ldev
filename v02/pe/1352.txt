BṚHATTA¦(M). A song of Sāma (conciliation—one of
the four expedients) originated from the head of her-
mit Pāñcajanya. From the face of his hermit another
song of Sāma called Rathantara also originated. These
two songs of Sāma are very effective expedients. So
they are called Tarasāharas (quickly effective). (M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapter 220, Stanza 7).
