BAKA II¦. A demon. As young boys Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Balarāmabhadra were once playing in Ambāḍi (Goku-
<div n="lb"/>la) on the banks of the river Yamunā when the
<div n="lb"/>demon, Baka, despatched by Kaṃsa, went to them in
<div n="lb"/>the form of a huge terrible-looking stork. In no time
<div n="lb"/>opening its ferocious beaks the stork swallowed Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>But the touch of Kṛṣṇa burnt the throat of the bird
<div n="lb"/>and vomitting Kṛṣṇa the bird fell dead.
