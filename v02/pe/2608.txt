HARIŚCANDRA II¦. An emperor of ancient times, to
<div n="lb"/>whom Brahmā gave as a gift a palace which automati-
<div n="lb"/>cally produced everything desired by its owner. He was
<div n="lb"/>lord over the seven islands. About his former birth and
<div n="lb"/>the plenitude of his riches the Padma Purāṇa (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>khaṇḍa, Chapter 32) has the following story to say:-
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra himself was surprised that he became so
<div n="lb"/>very rich in the matter of children and of wealth.
<div n="lb"/>Wondering what actions of his entitled him to so much
<div n="lb"/>wealth and to his position which was equal to Indra's
<div n="lb"/>the emperor went to Sumeru by vimāna where he
<div n="lb"/>questioned Sanatkumāra, a brahminical sage seated in
<div n="lb"/>meditation on a golden stone as to who he was in his
<div n="lb"/>past life and to which actions of his past life he owed
<div n="lb"/>all the present wealth and prosperity. The great sage
<div n="lb"/>replied as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>“In the past birth you were a truthful and pure-
<div n="lb"/>hearted vaiśya; you gave up your own profession and
<div n="lb"/>so you were ousted from home by your own people. At
<div n="lb"/>that time a famine and other scarcity conditions
<div n="lb"/>occurred there. One day you got into a pond along
<div n="lb"/>with your wife, collected lotus flowers from it and went
<div n="lb"/>to Kāśī to sell the flowers. But, no one purchased the
<div n="lb"/>flowers. At last, Candramatī, daughter of Indradyumna
[Page310-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>purchased the flowers for a yajña she was performing.
<div n="lb"/>When you saw Viṣṇu installed along with Ādityabha-
<div n="lb"/>gavān (Sun-God) and worshipped with flowers, fee-
<div n="lb"/>lings of devotion swept your mind and you too wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped the idols with lotus flowers. You enjoy today
<div n="lb"/>the fruits of that action in the past life.
<div n="NI"/>(It is not quite definite whether Hariścandra I and II
<div n="lb"/>are one and the same person).
