HARIŚCANDRA II¦. An emperor of ancient times, to
whom Brahmā gave as a gift a palace which automati-
cally produced everything desired by its owner. He was
lord over the seven islands. About his former birth and
the plenitude of his riches the Padma Purāṇa (Uttara
khaṇḍa, Chapter 32) has the following story to say:-
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra himself was surprised that he became so
very rich in the matter of children and of wealth.
Wondering what actions of his entitled him to so much
wealth and to his position which was equal to Indra's
the emperor went to Sumeru by vimāna where he
questioned Sanatkumāra, a brahminical sage seated in
meditation on a golden stone as to who he was in his
past life and to which actions of his past life he owed
all the present wealth and prosperity. The great sage
replied as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>“In the past birth you were a truthful and pure-
hearted vaiśya; you gave up your own profession and
so you were ousted from home by your own people. At
that time a famine and other scarcity conditions
occurred there. One day you got into a pond along
with your wife, collected lotus flowers from it and went
to Kāśī to sell the flowers. But, no one purchased the
flowers. At last, Candramatī, daughter of Indradyumna
[Page310-a+ 64]
purchased the flowers for a yajña she was performing.
When you saw Viṣṇu installed along with Ādityabha-
gavān (Sun-God) and worshipped with flowers, fee-
lings of devotion swept your mind and you too wor-
shipped the idols with lotus flowers. You enjoy today
the fruits of that action in the past life.
<div n="NI"/>(It is not quite definite whether Hariścandra I and II
are one and the same person).
