ARJUNA¦. The third of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Atri, Candra, Budha, Purūravas, Āyus, Nahuṣa, Yayāti,

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous birth.%} Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa are often re-
<div n="lb"/>ferred to as Naranārāyaṇas (Nara and Nārāyaṇa). In
<div n="lb"/>their previous life they were two Ṛṣis called Nara and
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa, and from that time onwards they lived as
<div n="lb"/>inseparable companions and sons of the same parents.
<div n="lb"/>They entered Mahāsamādhi at Badaryāśrama in the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas. Of the two Nārāyaṇarṣi was a partial in-
<div n="lb"/>carnation of Viṣṇu. About the Nararṣi the Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata has the following to say: “Dharma had his
<div n="lb"/>origin in the heart of Brahmā, and he earned great
<div n="lb"/>reputation for truthfulness and adherence to Vedic
<div n="lb"/>dharma. He married the daughters of Dakṣa. Dharma
<div n="lb"/>had four sons, Hari, Kṛṣṇa, Nara and Nārāyaṇa. Of
<div n="lb"/>the four sons Hari and Kṛṣṇa became great yogīs, and
<div n="lb"/>Nara and Nārāyaṇa, great tapasvins. Nara and Nārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa did tapas, worshipping Brahmā for 1000 years at
<div n="lb"/>the holy Badaryāśrama in the plains of the Himālayas.
<div n="lb"/>Nara was born in the next birth as Arjuna. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha). See Nara.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} To Vicitravīrya son of Śantanu was born
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra by Ambikā, and Pāṇḍu by Ambālikā.
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu had two wives, Kuntī and Mādrī. The curse of a
<div n="lb"/>Muni made physical contacts with his wives impossible for
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu. (See Pāṇḍu). Kuntī, before her marriage had
<div n="lb"/>attended on Maharṣi Durvāsas who pleased with her
<div n="lb"/>service made a gift of five mantras to her. The effect
<div n="lb"/>of the mantras was that Kuntī would become mother of
<div n="lb"/>a son from him about whom she was thinking while she
<div n="lb"/>repeated the mantra. As soon as she got the mantras
<div n="lb"/>she retired to a solitary place and thinking of the Sun-
<div n="lb"/>God repeated the first mantra. At once Sūryadeva appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed and Karṇa was born to her by him. After assuring
<div n="lb"/>her that the incident would not affect her chastity Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>disappeared. Kuntī abandoned the child to float in the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā, and stayed with Pāṇḍu keeping the other
<div n="lb"/>four mantras to herself. Since Pāṇḍu could not contact
<div n="lb"/>the body of his wives, with his permission Kuntī began
<div n="lb"/>practising the other four mantras one by one. By three
<div n="lb"/>mantras she got three sons, Dharmaputra from Kāla,
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna from Indra and Bhīmasena from the wind God
<div n="lb"/>(Vāyu). The remaining one mantra Kuntī gave to
<div n="lb"/>Mādrī. She repeated it thinking of the Aśvinī Devas,
<div n="lb"/>and two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva were born to her.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 63 onwards).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Festival of birth.%} At the birth of Arjuna Kuntī heard
<div n="lb"/>a heavenly voice declare as follows: “Oh! Kuntī!
<div n="lb"/>your son will be equal to Śiva in prowess and uncon-
<div n="lb"/>querable just as Indra is. After defeating all the Kings
<div n="lb"/>he will perform the Aśvamedha thrice. He will please
[Page049-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and get the great weapon called Pāśupata from
<div n="lb"/>him. On the orders of Indra he will kill Nivātakavacas.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing the above prophecy the Devas played ecstatic
<div n="lb"/>music and flowers were showered from the sky. The
<div n="lb"/>Saptarṣis, Prajāpatis and other sages arrayed themselves
<div n="lb"/>in the sky. Thus, all animate and inanimate objects
<div n="lb"/>celebrated the birth of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Naming.%} Sages from the top of the Śataśṛṅga
<div n="lb"/>mountain came together to perform the christening
<div n="lb"/>ceremony of Arjuna. While enumerating the various
<div n="lb"/>names of Arjuna, it is said in the Virāṭa Parva that
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa was the name Pāṇḍu gave to his son. (M.B., Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 123, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Childhood.%} The Pāṇḍavas spent their childhood at
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura with the Kauravas. Then Arjuna studied
<div n="lb"/>the art and science of using weapons, dance, music etc.
<div n="lb"/>along with the other boys. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>129, Verse 1). Kaśyapa, the high priest of Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>did for Arjuna the usual Saṃskāras like Upanayana
<div n="lb"/>(wearing of the holy thread) etc. Arjuna was taught
<div n="lb"/>the first lessons in Dhanurveda (Science of archery)
<div n="lb"/>by Rājarṣi Śuka. Afterwards, Kṛpācārya became the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor of the Pāṇḍavas in Dhanurveda, and it was
<div n="lb"/>then that Droṇācārya came. There is a particular story
<div n="lb"/>about Droṇācārya becoming the guru. (See Droṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Special favour of Droṇa.%} Arjuna showed very great
<div n="lb"/>interest in the science of the use of weapons. Droṇa, the
<div n="lb"/>master, wanted to teach Aśvatthāmā, his son, certain
<div n="lb"/>special things, and he began sending all his disciples to
<div n="lb"/>fetch water. Aśvatthāmā used to be the first to return
<div n="lb"/>with the water, and before the others returned Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>began teaching Aśvatthāmā the special lessons. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>came to understand this programme and he began
<div n="lb"/>returning with water along with Aśvatthāmā. Then
<div n="lb"/>the guru began teaching the special things to both
<div n="lb"/>Aśvatthāmā and Arjuna. Droṇa instructed the cook
<div n="lb"/>not to serve Arjuna food in the darkness. While
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna was once taking his food, wind blew out the
<div n="lb"/>burning lamp, and Arjuna alone continued eating.
<div n="lb"/>Because of constant practice Arjuna was quite sure
<div n="lb"/>about the position of the hand and the mouth in
<div n="lb"/>the process of eating, and Arjuna surmised from this
<div n="lb"/>that archery also could be practised in darkness. He
<div n="lb"/>began practising them. The guru came to know of it,
<div n="lb"/>and witnessing Arjuna's performance praised Arjuna as
<div n="lb"/>a unique archer. (Bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 132).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Ekalavya's finger was cut.%} Ekalavya, son of Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>dhanus, King of the Niṣādas (a tribe of hunters, forest-
<div n="lb"/>men) approached Droṇa to learn the science of the
<div n="lb"/>use of weapons. Droṇa, the Brahmin, refused the prayer
<div n="lb"/>of this prince of the forest tribe. Ekalavya, after pros-
<div n="lb"/>trating at the feet of Droṇa returned to the woods,
<div n="lb"/>made an image of Droṇa with earth and meditating
<div n="lb"/>upon it as guru began practising the use of weapons.
<div n="NI"/>The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas went hunting in the
<div n="lb"/>forest. Seeing there Ekalavya with his matted hair and
<div n="lb"/>clad in deer skin the hunting dogs began barking at
<div n="lb"/>him. Ekalavya shot into the mouth of the dog seven
<div n="lb"/>arrows at one and the same moment. With the arrows
<div n="lb"/>thrust in the mouth the dogs ran back to the Pāṇḍavas,
<div n="lb"/>and they found out the culprit, Ekalavya, who claimed
<div n="lb"/>himself to be a disciple of Droṇa. Grief-stricken at this
<div n="lb"/>claim Arjuna hurried up to Droṇa and said: “You had
<div n="lb"/>pronounced me to be your foremost disciple without an
<div n="lb"/>equal. But, today Ekalavya, another disciple of yours
[Page049-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>has relegated me to the second place”. Thereupon
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa went and saw Ekalavya in the forest. Ekalavya,
<div n="lb"/>in all devotion stood up and saluted the guru. And
<div n="lb"/>the guru said as follows: “Oh! Ekalavya if thou
<div n="lb"/>art my disciple give me the dakṣiṇā (fee) due to the
<div n="lb"/>guru, and I desire to get the thumb of your right hand as
<div n="lb"/>my fee”. At once Ekalavya cut his thumb and gave it to
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa. Henceforth Arjuna became Droṇa's unequalled
<div n="lb"/>disciple. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 132).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Arjuna got Brahmaśirāstra.%} When once Droṇa and
<div n="lb"/>his disciples were bathing in the river Gaṅgā, a whale
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of the leg of the guru. The combined
<div n="lb"/>efforts of the disciples failed to extricate the leg from
<div n="lb"/>the grip of the whale. Ultimately Arjuna shot an arrow
<div n="lb"/>and released the guru's leg. Greatly pleased at this
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa imparted to Arjuna knowledge about Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>śirāstra, and Arjuna was enjoined not to use the astra
<div n="lb"/>against men, but to use it only when confronting
<div n="lb"/>higher beings than men. [Bhārata (Malayalam), Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 133].
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Competition in arms.%} When the training of the princes
<div n="lb"/>was almost over Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to have a rehear-
<div n="lb"/>sal of their attainments, and the scene for it also was
<div n="lb"/>set. The princes with bows and arrows appeared on
<div n="lb"/>the scene. Yudhiṣṭhira and others first exhibited their
<div n="lb"/>skill in shooting arrows in the order of their seniority.
<div n="lb"/>Every scene was explained to Dhṛtarāṣṭra by Vidura
<div n="lb"/>and to Gāndhārī by Sañjaya. Duryodhana and
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma clashed with each other. Aśvatthāmā pacified
<div n="lb"/>them and kept them apart. And, then Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa appeared on the scene, and the onlookers dec-
<div n="lb"/>lared them to be equal in skill in archery. When
<div n="lb"/>their shooting exhibition was over, Karṇa who got
<div n="lb"/>angry again rushed to the stage. Arjuna also got
<div n="lb"/>ready. Arjuna challenged Karṇa's eligibility on the
<div n="lb"/>ground that he was low-born and not a Kṣatriya. At
<div n="lb"/>once Duryodhana proclaimed him as the King of Aṅga.
<div n="lb"/>Though this pacified the scene, this competition in
<div n="lb"/>archery served much to make the Kauravas and the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas the bitterest of enemies. (M.B., Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters, 136, 137).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Arjuna's gurudakṣiṇā (Offering of fee to the preceptor).%}
<div n="lb"/>At the starting of training the princes Droṇa told them:
<div n="lb"/>“I have one thing in mind, and you must do it for
<div n="lb"/>me when you have completed the course of training.
<div n="lb"/>All the disciples except Arjuna kept silent at this, but
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna promised to fulfil the guru's wish at the
<div n="lb"/>proper time
<div n="NI"/>The training was over, and it was time for gurudakṣiṇā.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa asked to be brought bound before him Drupada,
<div n="lb"/>King of Pāñcāla. (For Droṇa's enmity towards Dru-
<div n="lb"/>pada see Drupada). Thereupon the Pāṇḍavas marched
<div n="lb"/>to Pāñcāla, and in a fierce battle Arjuna defeated
<div n="lb"/>Drupada. Though Bhīma tried to kill Drupada Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>did not permit it, but took him bound to Droṇa.
<div n="lb"/>This ended Droṇa's hatred towards Drupada, who
<div n="lb"/>now gifted half his kingdom to Droṇa. Droṇa was
<div n="lb"/>very much pleased with Arjuna for the above act,
<div n="lb"/>and advised him to fight even him (Droṇa) if the
<div n="lb"/>latter opposed him (Arjuna). To this Arjuna replied
<div n="lb"/>‘Yes’. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 139, Verse 14). With
<div n="lb"/>this promise to fight even the guru in case the guru
<div n="lb"/>attacked him Arjuna became the most reputed archer
<div n="lb"/>in Bhārata.
[Page050-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Jealousy of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} After the gurudakṣiṇā Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>marched against the neighbouring kingdom. He de-
<div n="lb"/>feated very easily in war the King of Yavana and the
<div n="lb"/>Kings Sauvīra, Vipula and Sumitra. These victories of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna made the Kauravas very anxious; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>brooded over it. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 138, Verses
<div n="lb"/>20-23).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Escape from the waxen palace.%} Duryodhana made
<div n="lb"/>up his mind to destroy the Pāṇḍavas somehow or
<div n="lb"/>other. He got the Pāṇḍavas to shift their residence to
<div n="lb"/>a palace made of wax at Vāraṇāvata, and one year after
<div n="lb"/>this the palace was set fire to. The Pāṇḍavas escaped
<div n="lb"/>death by fire through a tunnel and entered the forest,
<div n="lb"/>the next day. (See Arakkillam).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Arjuna on the banks of river Ga gā.%} The Pāṇḍavas walk-
<div n="lb"/>ed much through the terrible forest, and after midnight
<div n="lb"/>reached the banks of the Gaṅgā. At that time Aṃgāra-
<div n="lb"/>parṇa (Citraratha), the Gandharva was enjoying
<div n="lb"/>his time in the river with some Apsarā women. The
<div n="lb"/>presence of men at the scene, the Gandharva did not
<div n="lb"/>relish. Arjuna and the Gandharva crossed in words,
<div n="lb"/>which led to a duel. In the duel the Gandharva was
<div n="lb"/>defeated. As the wife of the Gandharva prayed with
<div n="lb"/>tears in her eyes Arjuna spared him his life. The
<div n="lb"/>grateful Gandharva told the Pāṇḍavas many interesting
<div n="lb"/>stories. He also made a present of divine horses and
<div n="lb"/>imparted to them the esoteric knowledge called Cākṣuṣī-
<div n="lb"/>vidyā. The Gandharva finally told the Pāṇḍavas that
<div n="lb"/>they were attacked because they came without Agni and
<div n="lb"/>Āhuti in their front. He also explained this fact that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna could subjugate him on account of his (Arjuna's)
<div n="lb"/>genuine celibacy. (See Citraratha).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Pāñcālisvayaṃvara.%} Citraratha, during his talks
<div n="lb"/>with the āṇḍavas had pointed out to them the need to
<div n="lb"/>have a priest to lead and guide them in all matters,
<div n="lb"/>and accordingly they visited Dhaumyāśrama and ins-
<div n="lb"/>talled the Maharṣi (Dhaumya) as their priest.
<div n="NI"/>And, meantime seeing thousands of people on their way
<div n="lb"/>to attend the Svayaṃvara (marriage by open choice
<div n="lb"/>of husband by the girl) of Kṛṣṇā (Pāñcālī) daughter
<div n="lb"/>of the King of āñcāla, the Pāṇḍavas also followed the
<div n="lb"/>crowd. Veda Vyāsa, whom the Pāṇḍavas met on their
<div n="lb"/>way blessed them. King Drupada wished to give his
<div n="lb"/>daughter Kṛṣṇā in marriage to Arjuna. The news that
<div n="lb"/>the ṇḍa as were burned to death in the palace of
<div n="lb"/>wax grieved Drupada. Yet he had made arrangements for
<div n="lb"/>a trial of strength by Heroes at the Svayaṃvara. A
<div n="lb"/>tremendous bow was got ready and installed on the
<div n="lb"/>ground, and a machine constructed which was kept
<div n="lb"/>suspended in the air. The target was placed inside
<div n="lb"/>the machine. And then Drupada spoke thus: “My
<div n="lb"/>daughter shall be married to him who will bend the
<div n="lb"/>bow and with the first arrow hit the target placed
<div n="lb"/>inside the machine”. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 155,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 11). Great warriors like Duryodhana, Karṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Śiśupāla, Śiṃśumāra took their seats in the marriage
<div n="lb"/>hall. All the kings failed even to lift the bow up. Ulti-
<div n="lb"/>mately Arjuna lifted the bow and hit the target very
<div n="lb"/>easily. Pāñcālī put the wedding garland on Arjuna's
<div n="lb"/>neck. When the Pāṇḍavas returned to their mother
<div n="lb"/>with Pāñcālī in the evening the mother from inside her
<div n="lb"/>room said: “What you have got today, my sons, you
<div n="lb"/>enjoy among yourselves.” Kuntī said this under the
<div n="lb"/>impression that what her sons had got was some
<div n="lb"/>Bhikṣā. At any rate, in obedience to the above injunc-
[Page050-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>tion of the mother Pāñcālī became wife to the five
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapters 190, 191).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Arjuna at Indraprastha.%} The svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>broadcast news about the whereabouts of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra brought them back to Indraprastha, and
<div n="lb"/>installed them in a new palace built at the place called
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍavaprastha. (Indraprastha). Dharmaputra ruled
<div n="lb"/>a part of the country with Indraprastha as capital.
<div n="lb"/>Nārada went there once and advised the Pāṇḍavas to
<div n="lb"/>guard themselves against mutual quarrels as the five of
<div n="lb"/>them claimed one and the same woman as wife. Thence-
<div n="lb"/>forth it was set forth that Pāñcālī would live with each
<div n="lb"/>husband in turn for one year. It was also settled that
<div n="lb"/>during a particular year if any other husband than the
<div n="lb"/>one whose turn it was to live with Pāñcālī saw her the
<div n="lb"/>intruder was to go on a pilgrimage for one year.
<div n="NI"/>Once a brahmin came to the palace complaining that
<div n="lb"/>his cows were stolen by thieves, and Arjuna promised to
<div n="lb"/>help him. Arjuna did so without remembering that all
<div n="lb"/>his weapons were stored in Dharmaputra's palace. That
<div n="lb"/>year Pāñcālī was living with Dharmaputra. Forgetting
<div n="lb"/>the fact Arjuna went to Dharmaputra's palace, got his
<div n="lb"/>weapons and helped the brahmin. For thus breaking
<div n="lb"/>the rule Arjuna left his palace on a pilgrimage for one
<div n="lb"/>year.
<div n="NI"/>17A) {%Arjuna married Ulūpikā and Citrāṅgadā.%} Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>with his bow and arrows went into the forest. Many
<div n="lb"/>brahmins followed him. Arjuna reached the banks of
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and entered the waters for a bath. Here Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>was attracted by Ulūpikā, daughter of the Nāga King
<div n="lb"/>and he married her. A son was born to them called Irā-
<div n="lb"/>vān. After visiting places like Agastyavaṭam, Vasiṣṭhagiri
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna reached Manalur. He married Citrāṅgadā,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Citrāṅgada, King of Manalur. After a stay
<div n="lb"/>of three months there he went southwards. Citrāṅgadā
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to a son named Babhruvāhana.
<div n="NI"/>17B) {%The mark on Arjuna's flag is Hanūmān, and the%}
<div n="lb"/>{%following story is attached to it.%} Arjuna, once during a
<div n="lb"/>tour of the country was much surprised to see the Dam
<div n="lb"/>constructed by Śrī Rāma from Rāmeśvara to Laṅkā.
<div n="lb"/>He also felt that it was not at all proper on the part
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Rāma to have sought the help of monkeys to
<div n="lb"/>construct the dam. Śrī Rāma could have made a dam
<div n="lb"/>with arrows. Arjuna put this question to a great
<div n="lb"/>scholar (Pandit) who was sitting nearby reading the
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa. Neither the Pandit nor the other brahmins
<div n="lb"/>gathered there could give a convincing answer to Ar-
<div n="lb"/>juna's doubts. Then a monkey child went up to Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and told him with pride that a dam made of arrows
<div n="lb"/>would have broken when the monkeys walked on it.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna said then, “no, no, no monkey will be able to
<div n="lb"/>break the dam built with Rāma's arrows; which monkey
<div n="lb"/>will break a dam of arrows made even by me?” And,
<div n="lb"/>a debate began about the subject. The monkey and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna agreed to a bet that if a monkey broke the dam
<div n="lb"/>made by Arjuna he would end his life by jumping into
<div n="lb"/>fire, and if the monkey could not break the dam it
<div n="lb"/>would for ever be Arjuna's slave. Arjuna constructed
<div n="lb"/>a dam with arrows. And, as soon as the monkey set
<div n="lb"/>foot on it it was broken. Arjuna tried again. Though
<div n="lb"/>now it caused some efforts on the part of the monkey
<div n="lb"/>the dam broke this time also. Arjuna was thus left with
<div n="lb"/>no alternative but to die by jumping into fire and a
<div n="lb"/>fire was accordingly lit. Before Arjuna jumped into the
<div n="lb"/>fire a brahmin boy, who was bathing in the river ran
[Page051-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>upto Arjuna and told him that his attempt at self
<div n="lb"/>annihilation was not justified as the bet was made with-
<div n="lb"/>out an arbiter. When Arjuna who was wedded so
<div n="lb"/>much to truth brushed aside this argument and got
<div n="lb"/>ready to end his life the boy said: “If you are so very
<div n="lb"/>insistent about it you (Arjuna and the monkey) com-
<div n="lb"/>pete once again with me as arbiter. This suggestion of
<div n="lb"/>the boy was accepted. The monkey child tried its best
<div n="lb"/>to break the dam, but it failed. It developed its body
<div n="lb"/>to the size of a mountain and jumped on the dam.
<div n="lb"/>Even then it did not break. Then he ran up to the boy
<div n="lb"/>who was acting as arbiter and prostrated at his feet
<div n="lb"/>crying ‘Rāmacandra’. At the same moment Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>also prostrated before the boy crying ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa, slave
<div n="lb"/>to devotees’. The boy asked both of them to get up,
<div n="lb"/>and after admonishing them for their conceit gave them
<div n="lb"/>good advice. He also asked the monkey child to keep
<div n="lb"/>his word by remaining as the emblem of Arjuna's flag.
<div n="NI"/>(The monkey boy was actually Hanūmān and the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy Śrī Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>17C) {%Arjuna married Subhadrā.%} Arjuna went to the holy
<div n="lb"/>place called Saubhadratīrtha and redeemed the woman
<div n="lb"/>named Vargā from the curse she was labouring under.
<div n="lb"/>(See Vargā). Arjuna continued his journey and reached
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa and Prabhāsa tīrtha, where he met Gada,
<div n="lb"/>brother of Śrī kṛṣṇa. Gada described to Arjuna the
<div n="lb"/>great beauty of his sister, Subhadrā. Arjuna went to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā and paid his respects to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. A few days
<div n="lb"/>later the yādavas celebrated a great festival at mount
<div n="lb"/>Raivataka. Arjuna went there disguised as a Sannyāsin
<div n="lb"/>and forcibly took away Subhadrā with him with the
<div n="lb"/>permission of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Though the yādavas got ready
<div n="lb"/>for a fight they were ultimately pacified, and Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>was married to Arjuna. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter,
<div n="lb"/>218-224).
<div n="NI"/>17D) {%Brahmin boy saved.%} When once Arjuna was in
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā with Śrī Kṛṣṇa a brahmin appeared on the
<div n="lb"/>scene lamenting that his child died as soon as it was
<div n="lb"/>born. Nobody paid any heed to this, and then Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>rose up and assured protection to the next child to be
<div n="lb"/>born to the brahmin and asked him to return home in
<div n="lb"/>peace. Arjuna also vowed that he would end his life
<div n="lb"/>by jumping into fire if he failed to protect the next
<div n="lb"/>child of the brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>As the time for the delivery of his wife approached the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin took Arjuna home. Arjuna made the house
<div n="lb"/>secure by making an enclosure with his arrows. Yet
<div n="lb"/>the child died; not only that, at the time of birth it-
<div n="lb"/>self its body disappeared. And, the brahmin heaped
<div n="lb"/>insults on Arjuna, who looked very foolish. Rendered
<div n="lb"/>thus an object of ridicule Arjuna began to make a fire
<div n="lb"/>for him to jump into. At this Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared be-
<div n="lb"/>fore Arjuna and prevented him from jumping into fire.
<div n="lb"/>And then both Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna went to Viṣṇuloka
<div n="lb"/>and submitted the case of the brahmin to him. Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>told them: “Oh! Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, it was I who took
<div n="lb"/>away the brahmin boys for the pleasure of seeing you
<div n="lb"/>both here. You may immediately return with the brah-
<div n="lb"/>min boys. And, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna returned with the
<div n="lb"/>boys to the brahmin, who now felt very happy.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Daśama Skandha, Chapter 89).
<div n="NI"/>17E) {%Burning of Khāṇḍava forest.%} While Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>were spending their days on the banks of river Yamunā
<div n="lb"/>in the summer season Agni Bhagavān (the fire-god)
<div n="lb"/>requested them to give the Khāṇḍava forest as food to
[Page051-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>him. (See Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna agreed to oblige
<div n="lb"/>Agni Bhagavān, who presented to Arjuna the bow
<div n="lb"/>called Gāṇḍīva, a white horse and many other power-
<div n="lb"/>ful arrows. When Agni began burning the forest, Indra
<div n="lb"/>sent a heavy shower of rain. By creating a tent with
<div n="lb"/>arrows Arjuna saved the forest from the rain. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>killed Takṣaka's wife, cursed the N ga called Aśvasena
<div n="lb"/>and saved Maya, the architect of the Asuras who was
<div n="lb"/>put up in the forest. Indra was pleased and gifted many
<div n="lb"/>divine arrows to Arjuna. Maya gave the famous conch,
<div n="lb"/>Devadattam to Arjuna. By now the one year of the
<div n="lb"/>pilgrimage of Arjuna was over and he returned to
<div n="lb"/>Indraprastha. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapters 233-239).
<div n="NI"/>17P) {%Fight between Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} (See Gālava,
<div n="lb"/>para 4).
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Again to the forest.%} Maya, who escaped death in
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍava forest, in his great gratitude, went to Indra-
<div n="lb"/>prastha, and with the permission of Dharmaputra built
<div n="lb"/>for the Pāṇḍavas an exceptionally beautiful palace.
<div n="lb"/>And then the Pāṇḍavas made the conquest of all the
<div n="lb"/>earth, and after killing enemy kings like Jarāsandha,
<div n="lb"/>the Kimpuruṣas, the Hādakas, Śiśupāla, Kurundha and
<div n="lb"/>Bhagadatta returned to Idraprastha and performed
<div n="lb"/>the Rājasūya yajña. The Kauravas who got jealous at
<div n="lb"/>this went on a visit to Indraprastha. When they enter-
<div n="lb"/>ed the palace built by Maya they were put into many
<div n="lb"/>a ludicrous situation. (See Sabhāpraveśa). Insulted
<div n="lb"/>and humiliated they returned to Hastināpura and
<div n="lb"/>challenged the Pāṇḍavas to a game of dice, and in the
<div n="lb"/>game the Pāṇḍavas lost not only their kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>other riches, but Pāñcālī as well. Duśśāsana dragged
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī and stripped her of her clothes in the royal
<div n="lb"/>assembly and thus mercilessly insulted her. According
<div n="lb"/>to the terms and condition agreed to with reference to
<div n="lb"/>the game of dice, the Pāṇḍavas had to lead forest life
<div n="lb"/>for twelve years and live for one year incognito. The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas again started for the forest. (M.B., Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Pāṇḍavas in Kāmyaka forest.%} A number of brahmins
<div n="lb"/>also accompanied the Pāṇḍavas to the forest. The noble
<div n="lb"/>brahmin, Śaunaka consoled the aggrieved Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra in the Dvaitavana. Dharmaputra felt worried
<div n="lb"/>that he could not feed the brahmins who accompanied
<div n="lb"/>him into the forest. Pāñcālī prayed to the Sun-God,
<div n="lb"/>and he gave the Akṣayapātra to her. (See Akṣyapātra).
<div n="lb"/>And, after this the Pāṇḍavas, along with the brahmins,
<div n="lb"/>entered the Kāmyaka forest. (M.B., Araṇya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 36).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%Arjuna secured divine arrows.%} Dharmaputra asked
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna to do tapas in the Himālayas and thus secure
<div n="lb"/>divine arrows. Accordingly Arjuna went south and saw
<div n="lb"/>Indra in the Indrakīla mountain. Indra gave him
<div n="lb"/>boons. There Arjuna killed Mūkāsura. And, then
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna went to Mount Kailāsa and prayerfully concen-
<div n="lb"/>trated his mind on Śiva. Śiva appeared in the guise of
<div n="lb"/>a forest dweller. (See Pāśupatāstra). After that he got
<div n="lb"/>the Daṇḍāstra from Yama, Pāśāstra from Varuṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Antardhānāstra from Kubera. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 37-41).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%Arjuna in Indraloka.%} Indra, who was so very pleas-
<div n="lb"/>ed that Arjuna got so many divine arrows deputed his
<div n="lb"/>charioteer, Mātali, to bring Arjuna to Devaloka, and
<div n="lb"/>at Devaloka he learned more about archery and music.
<div n="lb"/>The Apsarā women forgot themselves when they saw
<div n="lb"/>the exceptionally handsome Arjuna. Urvaśī, mad with
[Page052-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>love, sent her messenger Citrasena to Indra. Being told
<div n="lb"/>about Urvaśī's love Arjuna closed both his ears with
<div n="lb"/>hands, and reminded the messenger of Urvaśī's mater-
<div n="lb"/>nal position with reference to him. Urvaśī cursed and
<div n="lb"/>turned Arjuna into an eunuch. Indra consoled Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>by assuring him that Urvaśī's curse will turn out to be
<div n="lb"/>of great benefit to him. Afterwards Arjuna stayed in
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka for a few days with Citrasena, and during
<div n="lb"/>the period he killed Nivātakavaca and Kālakeya.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna became a friend of Maharṣi Lomaśa, who had
<div n="lb"/>gone to Devaloka to see Indra. Promising Arjuna that
<div n="lb"/>he would protect Dharmaputra Lomaśa returned to the
<div n="lb"/>earth. Arjuna left the Kāmyaka forest and returned to
<div n="lb"/>his brothers after an absence for five years. He met the
<div n="lb"/>brothers at Mount Gandhamādana. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 42-47).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Procession.%} At last a witty and humorous brahmin
<div n="lb"/>went to Dhṛtarāṣṭra and dilated upon the hardships
<div n="lb"/>being suffered by the Pāṇḍavas, and Duryodhana and
<div n="lb"/>others were extremely pleased and happy to hear it.
<div n="lb"/>Yet, they shed crocodile tears. But, Duryodhana was
<div n="lb"/>in a mighty hurry to see with his own eyes the pitiable
<div n="lb"/>plight of the Pāṇḍavas. On the pretext of going out for
<div n="lb"/>hunting Duryodhana and others with the permission of
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, started for the forest with a number of
<div n="lb"/>attendants. 8,000 chariots, 30,000 elephants, thousands
<div n="lb"/>of infantry soldiers, 9,000 horses, merchants, ornaments,
<div n="lb"/>courtesans and thousands of hunters formed this pro-
<div n="lb"/>cession into the forest. Just like roaring winds during
<div n="lb"/>the rainy season the procession caused thunderous noise.
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana approached the pool in the Dvaita forest
<div n="lb"/>and waited at a distance. (M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 239, Verses 25-29).
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana and attendants put up tents in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>The Gandharvas obstructed Duryodhana, and he and
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharva called Citrasena clashed with each
<div n="lb"/>other. Duryodhana was made a prisoner. Arjuna came
<div n="lb"/>on the scene and released him. And, thus humiliated
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana returned to Hastināpura with the atten-
<div n="lb"/>dants. (M.B., Āraṇya Parva, Chapters 239-253).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Arjuna lost consciousness.%} While once Pāñcālī was
<div n="lb"/>alone King Jayadratha forcibly took her away. Within
<div n="lb"/>seconds the Pāṇḍavas confronted Jayadratha and regain-
<div n="lb"/>ed Pāñcālī. Jayadratha and his men were killed. The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas, who were very weary and tired walking in
<div n="lb"/>the forest felt extremely thirsty. Nakula, at the instance
<div n="lb"/>of Dharmaputra climbed a tree and looked around and
<div n="lb"/>sighted a pool of clear water. When Nakula went to the
<div n="lb"/>pool and began to draw water a voice from above was
<div n="lb"/>heard saying as follows: “Do not be so very daring.
<div n="lb"/>This is my ancestral wealth. If you answer my ques-
<div n="lb"/>tions you may not only drink the water but also take
<div n="lb"/>some with you”. Without paying any heed to this warn-
<div n="lb"/>ing Nakula drank water from the pool, and lo! he fell
<div n="lb"/>down unconscious immediately. Sahadeva who went to
<div n="lb"/>the pool in search of Nakula and drank water from the
<div n="lb"/>pool also met with the same fate as Nakula. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and Bhīma also had the same fate at the pool. Lastly
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra went to the pool and understanding what
<div n="lb"/>happened to his brothers requested permission to drink
<div n="lb"/>water. At once a Yakṣa appeared and brought the bro-
<div n="lb"/>thers of Dharmaputra back to consciousness. In fact,
<div n="lb"/>the Yakṣa was none other than Yamadharmadeva. (For
<div n="lb"/>questions and answers of the Yakṣa see Dharmaputra.)
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chapters 312-315).
[Page052-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Life incognito.%} Now the twelve years of forest life
<div n="lb"/>being over the Pāṇḍavas decided to spend the one year
<div n="lb"/>of life incognito in the Virāṭa palace. Arjuna disguised
<div n="lb"/>himself and deposited his clothes and weapons in the
<div n="lb"/>hollow of a Śami tree in the forest. And the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>in various disguises reached the Virāṭa palace. They
<div n="lb"/>assumed false names: Dharmaputra as Kaṅka, Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>as Valāla, Arjuna as Bṛhannala, Nakula as Granthika
<div n="lb"/>and Sahadeva as Ariṣṭanemi and Draupadī as Mālinī.
<div n="NI"/>When the life incognito of the Pāṇḍavas for one year
<div n="lb"/>was about to expire a rumour reached the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>that the Pāṇḍavas were at the Virāṭa capital, and the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas thought that the Pāṇḍavas will appear on the
<div n="lb"/>scene if a war was fought against King Virāṭa. The
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas, with this object in view, lifted the cows of
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa and that led to war. Uttara, the prince of Virāṭa
<div n="lb"/>boasted that he would fight provided he had a good
<div n="lb"/>charioteer. Bṛhannala (Arjuna) agreed to act as such
<div n="lb"/>and they started for the warfield. At the sight of the
<div n="lb"/>massive army of the Kauravas Uttara got frightened
<div n="lb"/>and tried to run away from the field. But Bṛhannala
<div n="lb"/>tightly bound Uttara to the chariot, drove it very fast
<div n="lb"/>to the forest, took back from the hollow of the Śami
<div n="lb"/>tree his weapons and returned to the battle-field. The
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas were absolutely defeated in the war and they
<div n="lb"/>took to their heels. They understood that the very clever
<div n="lb"/>and terrible warrior in disguise was Arjuna himself. But,
<div n="lb"/>by the time the period of the Pāṇḍavas life incognito
<div n="lb"/>was over. The king of Virāṭa, greatly pleased over this
<div n="lb"/>victory in war gave his daughter, Uttarā in marriage to
<div n="lb"/>Abhiṃanyu, son of Arjuna. (M.B., Virāṭa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Preparations for war.%} After the forest life and life
<div n="lb"/>incognito the Pāṇḍavas returned. The Kauravas refus-
<div n="lb"/>ed to give them half the Kingdom. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, on behalf
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas, implored that half the kingdom or five
<div n="lb"/>districts or five houses or at least one house be given to
<div n="lb"/>them. But the Kauravas took the stand that not even
<div n="lb"/>an iota of land would be given to the Pāṇḍavas. And,
<div n="lb"/>war was perforce decided upon. Duryodhana went to
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā to request for support in war. Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>who favoured the Pāṇḍavas lay in false sleep as he did
<div n="lb"/>not want to fight against them. Duryodhana sat at the
<div n="lb"/>head of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna, who came after some time sat
<div n="lb"/>at the feet of Kṛṣṇa and remained there standing.
<div n="lb"/>Awakening from sleep, it was Arjuna whom Kṛṣṇa saw
<div n="lb"/>first. After the greetings were over with Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>saw Duryodhana also. Between Kṛṣṇa without any arms
<div n="lb"/>and the armed forces of Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna chose Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Duryodhana his armed forces to help each side in
<div n="lb"/>the impending war. (Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>26) {%War.%} Both the Parties were encamped in Kuruk-
<div n="lb"/>ṣetra ready for war. Śrī Kṛṣṇa acted as Charioteer to
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. He stopped the chariot in between the opposing
<div n="lb"/>armies. Arjuna felt deep anguish to find his own people
<div n="lb"/>arrayed on the opposite side for war. Reluctant to kill
<div n="lb"/>relations, elders, friends and preceptors Arjuna laid
<div n="lb"/>down his arms in the chariot. Then did Kṛṣṇa instruct
<div n="lb"/>him in Karmayoga (the philosophy of action). That
<div n="lb"/>instruction and advice of Kṛṣṇa is the world-famous
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavad Gītā. The Gītā cleared off Arjuna's illusions
<div n="lb"/>and he praised the Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who revealed his
<div n="lb"/>all comprehensive form (Viśvarūpa) to Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>On the first day of the war Arjuna fought a duel with
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma, and the second day he fought the Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>forces with exceptional prowess. And then Arjuna pre-
[Page053-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>vented Kṛṣṇa from killing Bhīṣma. But, the Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>army faced defeat that day. On the third day Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>defeated Bhīṣma, Aśvatthāmā, Trigartta, Bhagadatta
<div n="lb"/>and others. Thereupon a really fierce fight began. The
<div n="lb"/>war lasted for 18 days. The important incidents during
<div n="lb"/>the 18 days can be summarised as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>(1) Fierce fight between Arjuna and Bhīṣma.
<div n="lb"/>(2) Fight between Arjuna and Aśvatthāmā.

<div n="lb"/>to Bhīṣma who, dislodged from the chariot, was
<div n="lb"/>lying on a bed of arrows.
<div n="lb"/>(16) Cool water sprinkled on the face of Bhīṣma with
<div n="lb"/>the aid of divine arrows.
<div n="lb"/>(17) Fought against Droṇa and defeated his forces.
<div n="lb"/>(18) Satyajit deputed to remain with Dharmaputra to
<div n="lb"/>help him.
<div n="lb"/>(19) Sudhanvā killed.
<div n="lb"/>(20) Again fought with Bhagadatta.
<div n="lb"/>(21) Supratīka, the elephant of Bhagadatta killed.
<div n="lb"/>(22) And after that, Bhagadatta also killed.
<div n="lb"/>(23) Vṛṣaka and Acala killed by Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>(24) Śakuni defeated.
<div n="lb"/>(25) Arjuna killed the three brothers of Karṇa and con-
<div n="lb"/>fronted Karṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(26) Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, killed.
<div n="lb"/>(27) Hearing about the death of Abhimanyu, Arjuna fell
<div n="lb"/>down unconscious.
<div n="lb"/>(28) Awakened, Arjuna vowed to kill Jayadratha.
<div n="lb"/>(29) Arjuna performed Śiva Pūjā.
<div n="lb"/>(30) Arjuna dreamt that night to have paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>Śiva along with Kṛṣṇa and that Śiva gave him
<div n="lb"/>divine arrows like Pāśupata.
<div n="lb"/>(31) Marched forth routing the elephant regiment of
<div n="lb"/>Durmarṣaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(32) Routed Duśśāsana in fight.
<div n="lb"/>(33) Again fought Droṇa, Kṛtavarmā, Śrutāyudha,
<div n="lb"/>Sudakṣiṇa, King of Kāmboja.
<div n="lb"/>(34) Sudakṣiṇa killed in fight.
<div n="lb"/>(35) Śrutāyu, Acyutāyu, Niyutāyu, Ambaṣṭha and the
<div n="lb"/>Mlecchas' army killed.

<div n="lb"/>(40) Arjuna cut off the right hand of Bhūriśravas at
<div n="lb"/>the instance of Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(41) Cut off the head of Jayadratha with arrows. The
<div n="lb"/>head and the arrows were thrown on the lap of
<div n="lb"/>Jayadratha's father.
[Page053-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>(42) Alambuṣa, King of Rākṣasas killed.
<div n="lb"/>(43) Daṇḍadhāra killed with his elephant.
<div n="lb"/>(44) Arjuna killed the six brothers of Suśarmā, viz.,
<div n="lb"/>Satyasena, Candrasena, Mitrasena, Śrutañjaya,
<div n="lb"/>Sauśruti and Mitradharmā
<div n="lb"/>(45) Difference of opinion arose between Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>and Arjuna about the failure to kill Karṇa, and
<div n="lb"/>in the heat of excitement Arjuna called his elder
<div n="lb"/>brother ‘thou’.
<div n="lb"/>(46) Immediately repenting Arjuna drew sword to kill
<div n="lb"/>himself. But, regained mental peace by begging
<div n="lb"/>pardon of the brother.
<div n="lb"/>(47) Killed Vṛṣasena, son of Karṇa,
<div n="lb"/>(48) Karṇa brought down Kṛṣṇa's crown by his arrow
<div n="lb"/>resembling the face of the serpent. Enraged at this
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna killed Karṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(49) Killed Satyakarmā, Satyeṣṭha and others.
<div n="lb"/>(50) After bowing to Vyāsa, Arjuna withdrew arrow.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Śalya and Sauptika
<div n="lb"/>Parvas).
<div n="NI"/>27) {%After the war.%} In the great war the Kaurava army,
<div n="lb"/>to the very last man, was annihilated. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>assembled together. Thoughts about the future came up.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa consoled the sorrowing Dharmaputra. As
<div n="lb"/>desired by Vyāsa, Kṛṣṇa, Dharmaputra and others
<div n="lb"/>returned to Hastināpura and took up the reins of
<div n="lb"/>governing the country, and the idea of performing an
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha Yāga was seriously mooted. A King named
<div n="lb"/>Marutta agreed to give money needed for the yajña.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna defeated all enemy kings. (M.B., Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>28) {%Death and rebirth of Arjuna.%} On his way back
<div n="lb"/>after digvijaya Arjuna was killed by the arrows of his
<div n="lb"/>son, Babhruvāhana. Immediately did Ulūpī, Arjuna's
<div n="lb"/>wife bring back to life her husband by Mṛtasañjīvanī
<div n="lb"/>mantra. Then Arjuna questioned Ulūpī about the
<div n="lb"/>reason for his son killing him, and also as to how she
<div n="lb"/>happened to be present at the time. Ulūpī described
<div n="lb"/>the story of a curse in answer to Arjuna's querry.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 79).
<div n="NI"/>29) {%The story of the curse.%} Ulūpī said: You shall not
<div n="lb"/>get angry. Yes, all is for the best. In war you killed
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma by unrighteous means, viz. with the help of
<div n="lb"/>Śikhaṇḍī. On his death, the Aṣṭavasus and Gaṅgā Devī
<div n="lb"/>cursed you with hell. I told about this curse to my
<div n="lb"/>father, who begged the Vasus for redemption, and they
<div n="lb"/>said that you would be redeemed from the curse when
<div n="lb"/>your son, Babhruvāhana, killed you. Accordingly he
<div n="lb"/>has been brought here to kill you.
<div n="NI"/>The above story pleased Arjuna. (Aśvamedha Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 81).
<div n="NI"/>30) {%Aśvamedham.%} Arjuna again defeated Meghasandhi,
<div n="lb"/>the King of Magadha, Śakuniputra and others and
<div n="lb"/>returned to Hastināpura, where the Aśvamedha yajña
<div n="lb"/>was performed. The Yādava dynasty was extinguished
<div n="lb"/>before long. Arjuna did all the rites due to them on
<div n="lb"/>death. He grieved over the departure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, Chapter 31). And then he
<div n="lb"/>went to Indraprastha with the consorts of Kṛṣṇa. On
<div n="lb"/>the way dacoits overcame Arjuna and snatched away
<div n="lb"/>some of the females. Arjuna felt very sad. Then Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>appeared and told him that he would be strong and
<div n="lb"/>powerful only in the presence of Kṛṣṇa. (Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>31) {%Pāṇḍavas' journey to the other world.%} Now, it was
<div n="lb"/>time for the Pāṇḍavas to journey to the other world.
[Page054-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>It was at this juncture that the Yādava dynasty ended
<div n="lb"/>and Śrī Kṛṣṇa was killed, and some of Kṛṣṇa's con-
<div n="lb"/>sorts were abducted. Arjuna could not save them, and
<div n="lb"/>they jumped into the river and died. Arjuna, who lost
<div n="lb"/>all his power began the great journey with his brothers.
<div n="lb"/>On their way Agnideva advised him to deposit reputed
<div n="lb"/>bow, Gāṇḍīva in the sea, and Arjuna did so. (Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>prasthāna Parva, Chapter 1, Verses 1-42). The Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas continued their journey, Yudhiṣṭhira leading them.
<div n="lb"/>They reached the Himālayas, and there Pāñcālī expir-
<div n="lb"/>ed. To Bhīma's querry as to why Pāñcālī expired first,
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira replied that it was due to her having been
<div n="lb"/>more partial to Arjuna. The others continued their
<div n="lb"/>journey and then Sahadeva died. Yudhiṣṭhira explain-
<div n="lb"/>ed that Sahadeva died second due to his arrogance
<div n="lb"/>and conceit. And, the others continued going forward.
<div n="lb"/>An emaciated dog was already with the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>during their journey. Nakula was the third to die, and
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira attributed it to his (Nakula) extreme con-
<div n="lb"/>ceit about his beauty. And, Arjuna's death next,
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira said, was due to his having not kept his
<div n="lb"/>vow, once made, to kill the whole lot of enemies in a
<div n="lb"/>day. After proceeding a short distance further Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>also fell dead, and Yudhiṣṭhira thought to himself
<div n="lb"/>that it was due to Bhīma's voracious eating. And, then
<div n="lb"/>Devendra came in his chariot of gold and welcomed
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira to Svarga. But, he refused the offer saying
<div n="lb"/>that he would not do go alone, leaving his brothers
<div n="lb"/>behind. When Indra assured him that his brothers
<div n="lb"/>were already there, in Svarga, Yudhiṣṭhira got into
<div n="lb"/>the chariot and reached Svarga, and he was elated to
<div n="lb"/>find his brothers there happy with Pāñcālī. (Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>prasthāna Parva and Svargārohaṇa).

<div n="NI"/>34) {%Origin of certain words.%} Towards the close of his
<div n="lb"/>life incognito, Arjuna went to the Śami tree to take
<div n="lb"/>out Gāṇḍīva kept in its hollow. Uttarā also was
<div n="lb"/>with Arjuna. Then Arjuna revealed himself to Uttarā,
<div n="lb"/>and also elaborated the meaning of his various names
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>I shall tell you my ten names. Arjuna, Phālguna, Jiṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>Kirīṭi, Śvetavāhana, Bhībhatsu, Vijaya, Kṛṣṇa, Savya-
<div n="lb"/>sācī and Dhanañjaya....I am called Dhanañjaya,
<div n="lb"/>because even after having conquered all the lands and
<div n="lb"/>amassed wealth I stand in the centre of righteousness
<div n="lb"/>....I am called Vijaya because in fights with haughty
<div n="lb"/>opponents I always succeed.....I am called Śvetavāhana
<div n="lb"/>because white horses are harnessed in war to my chariot
<div n="lb"/>decked with golden ornaments....I am called Phāl-
<div n="lb"/>guna because I was born in the month of Phālguna and
<div n="lb"/>under the star, Phālguna...I am kirīṭī because during
<div n="lb"/>my fight with the Daityas I put on my head crown
<div n="lb"/>glowing as Sun...I am called Bībhatsu by men and
<div n="lb"/>Devas because I never resort to revolting means during
<div n="lb"/>war...Devas and men call me Savyasācī because both
<div n="lb"/>my hands are adept in using the bow, Gāṇḍīva....I
<div n="lb"/>am Arjuna because, in the world people are rare who
<div n="lb"/>possess such fair colour as I do, and moreover I do
<div n="lb"/>only white (just and ethical) acts....I am called Jiṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>because I am unassailable and unconquerable, and I
<div n="lb"/>subjugate and conquer, and also because I am the son of
<div n="lb"/>Indra...My father gave me the tenth name of Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>because I was very attractive (Kṛṣṇa=attractive).
