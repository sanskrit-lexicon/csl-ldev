KĀRANDHAMANA¦ (M). A tīrtha situated near the
southern ocean. The five holy places in the southern
ocean, viz. Agastya tīrtha, Saubhadra tīrtha, Pauloma
tīrtha, Kārandhamana tīrtha and Bhāradvāja tīrtha were
called Pañca tīrthas. In the course of Arjuna's
pilgrimage, he visited these Pañca tīrthas. At that
time, the Sages never used to go there. There was a
special reason for it. The five celestial women, Vargā,
Saurabheyī, Samīcī, Budbudā and Latā used to live in
them in the form of crocodiles as a result of a sage's
curse. Arjuna liberated all of them. (For details see
under the word “Vargā”).
