GANDHARVANAGARA¦. Vyāsa has compared munis
disappearing from sight to the fading out of Gandharva
nagara.
<div n="NI"/>“After having thus spoken to the Kurus, and while
they were looking on, the band of sages disappeared
in a trice like the fading out of Gandharvanagara.”
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 126, Verses 35 and 36).
<div n="NI"/>What is this Gandharvanagara? The following descrip-
tion occurs in Hindi Śabdasāgara. “Owing to different
optical illusions (sight) of man, villages and cities may
appear to exist in the sky and also on seas, rivers, etc.
When during summer the air on the upper strata of
deserts, seas etc. gets heated, expanded, and rises up,
the light passing through it becomes multi-coloured and
gives reflections in the sky in the form of village parts or
cities. Also can be seen therein reflections of trees,
boats etc. One such reflection may be cast on earth
also. This is a mere optical illusion. This reflection
immediately fades out also. This unreal city which is
an optical illusion is Gandharvanagara.
