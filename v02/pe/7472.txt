TĀLADHVAJA¦. The phantom husband of Nārada. Once
<div n="lb"/>Nārada became a woman and a king called Tāladhvaja
<div n="lb"/>married her (Devī Purāṇa). It was to show how the
<div n="lb"/>mind is covered with illusion that Mahāviṣṇu made
<div n="lb"/>Nārada into a woman.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nārada went to Mahāviṣṇu and asked him about
<div n="lb"/>the secret of life. Mahāviṣṇu said that there was nothing
<div n="lb"/>called life and life exists because of Māyā the illusion
<div n="lb"/>of the mind. Nārada insisted that he should see ‘Māyā’
<div n="lb"/>(illusion) and so Viṣṇu started from Vaikuṇṭha with
<div n="lb"/>Nārada on the back of Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>Crossing forests, rivers, cities, lakes, villages and mount-
<div n="lb"/>ains they reached Kanyākubja. There they saw a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful lake. Garuḍa landed and Viṣṇu and Nārada
<div n="lb"/>got down. They walked along the shore of the lake
<div n="lb"/>for some time and then they sat beneath a tree for some
<div n="lb"/>time. After some time Mahāviṣṇu asked Nārada to
<div n="lb"/>take a bath in the lake. Pleased at this command
<div n="lb"/>Nārada placed his violin and deer-hide on the shore
<div n="lb"/>and after first washing his face and feet and doing
<div n="lb"/>‘ācamana’ with Kuśa grass in his hand stepped into
<div n="lb"/>the water for his bath. Mahāviṣṇu stood near the violin
<div n="lb"/>and deer-hide of Nārada and Nārada dipped himself in
<div n="lb"/>the water. What a surprise! Nārada was changed into
<div n="lb"/>a woman of great beauty. She had no memory of her
<div n="lb"/>previous birth and getting herself on to the shore she
<div n="lb"/>stood there watching the surroundings there. Then a
<div n="lb"/>king called Tāladhvaja came on horse-back that way.
<div n="lb"/>He addressed the beautiful woman as Saubhāgyasundarī
<div n="lb"/>and started talking with her. Within hours they got
<div n="lb"/>married and Tāladhvaja took her to his palace and
<div n="lb"/>spent the honey-moon there happily. Twelve years went
<div n="lb"/>by and Saubhāgyasundarī became pregnant. In due
<div n="lb"/>course she got a son named Vīravarmā. After another
<div n="lb"/>two years she got another son named Sudharmā. Thus
<div n="lb"/>she delivered a son every two years for twentyfour
<div n="lb"/>years becoming the mother of twelve sons. After some
<div n="lb"/>time she bore eight more sons also. When all the twenty
<div n="lb"/>sons came of age they were married according to the
<div n="lb"/>custom and in due course those sons also got sons. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Tāladhvaja and Saubhāgyasundarī became the heads of
<div n="lb"/>a large family of children and grand-children and lived
<div n="lb"/>happily. One day a king from a far-off place with a
<div n="lb"/>great army suddenly came and surrounded Kanyākubja.
<div n="lb"/>In the fight that ensued most of the sons and grand-sons
<div n="lb"/>of Saubhāgyasundarī were killed. The king fled from
<div n="lb"/>the battlefield and came to the palace. Saubhāgyasundarī
<div n="lb"/>was in great distress and when the enemies left the battle-
<div n="lb"/>field she secretly went there to have a last look at her
<div n="lb"/>sons and grandsons lying dead. The sight terrified her.
<div n="lb"/>They lay there without heads, hands or legs, eyes pro-
<div n="lb"/>truded, stomach cut open, intestines lying out and blood
<div n="lb"/>oozing out from everywhere. She fell to the ground
[Page784-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and wept bitterly. Then Mahāviṣṇu came there dis-
<div n="lb"/>guised as an old brahmin and talked to her. He gave
<div n="lb"/>her instructions on some truths about life. Saubhāgya-
<div n="lb"/>sundarī then called Tāladhvaja and they both went to
<div n="lb"/>the old lake and as instructed by the old brahmin
<div n="lb"/>Saubhāgyasundarī took a dip in the water. Lo! she
<div n="lb"/>became the old Nārada.
<div n="NI"/>When Nārada got up from the lake Mahāviṣṇu was
<div n="lb"/>still standing near his violin and deer-skin smiling at
<div n="lb"/>him. The sight of Viṣṇu gave him knowledge of all
<div n="lb"/>that had happened. He stood there recounting in his
<div n="lb"/>memory how he had requested Viṣṇu to show him
<div n="lb"/>Māyā and how he had taken a bath in that lake and
<div n="lb"/>how he had spent a long period of married life ending
<div n="lb"/>in misery and how Viṣṇu had come to her in the form
<div n="lb"/>of an old brahmin when she had cried to him in agony
<div n="lb"/>and how the old brahmin had taken her and Tāladh-
<div n="lb"/>vaja to the lake again and how he had become his
<div n="lb"/>old self again. He stood there still pondering over these
<div n="lb"/>when Viṣṇu called him and said “Come on Nārada,
<div n="lb"/>how slow you are. Finish your bath and come soon.
<div n="lb"/>What are you thinking about?” Tāladhvaja, however,
<div n="lb"/>was unmoved by any of these. He was puzzled to find
<div n="lb"/>a bearded Sannyāsī rising up from the place where his
<div n="lb"/>beautiful wife had dipped herself for a bath. He went
<div n="lb"/>to Nārada and asked “Oh best of sages, where is my
<div n="lb"/>wife who has just dipped herself in this same place?
<div n="lb"/>From where do you come?” Even before waiting to
<div n="lb"/>hear a reply from him the King began to make a hue
<div n="lb"/>and cry about the loss of his wife. Then Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>went to him and consoled him by saying with illustra-
<div n="lb"/>tions that ‘human ties are only ephemeral’ and asked
<div n="lb"/>him to take a bath in the lake. Tāladhvaja after his
<div n="lb"/>bath became disgusted with life and after doing penance
<div n="lb"/>in the forests attained mokṣa. (8th Skandha, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
