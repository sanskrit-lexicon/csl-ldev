TĀPATYA¦. Kuru was the son born to king Saṃvaraṇa
of his wife Tapatī. All the descendants of Kuru were
known as Kauravas and because they were of the
generation of Tapatī, they were known as Tāpatyas also.
The young Gandharva, Citraratha, who fought against
Arjuna on the banks of the river, Gaṅgā addressed
Arjuna as Tāpatya. (Śloka 79, Chapter 169, Ādi
Parva).
