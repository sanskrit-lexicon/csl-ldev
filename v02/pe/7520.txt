TĀRAKA II¦. Śiva Purāṇa mentions about a Tāraka,
<div n="lb"/>son of the minister of Bhadrasena, a King of Kashmir.
<div n="lb"/>This Tāraka was the rebirth of a he-fowl. Bhadrasena
<div n="lb"/>had a son named Sudharmā. He was the rebirth of a
<div n="lb"/>monkey. There is a story regarding how this fowl and
<div n="lb"/>the monkey came to be born in Kashmir as above.
<div n="NI"/>Once in the village of Nanda there was a prostitute
<div n="lb"/>named Mahānandā. Though she was a great devotee
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva she was living the life of a prostitute for her
<div n="lb"/>livelihood. She was having a monkey and a he-fowl
<div n="lb"/>as pets. She would adorn the necks of her pets with
<div n="lb"/>the rudrākṣa necklace (rosary) made of berry beads
<div n="lb"/>favourite of Śiva and when she sang songs in praise of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva those pets danced to the tune.
<div n="NI"/>One day a Vaiśya came there. He had a diamond Śiva
<div n="lb"/>liṅga with him. Mahānandā felt a great fancy for that
<div n="lb"/>and so promised the Vaiśya that if he gave her the
<div n="lb"/>diamond liṅga she would remain a faithful wife to him
<div n="lb"/>for three days. The Vaiśya agreed and the diamond
<div n="lb"/>liṅga was kept in a very secure place That night when
<div n="lb"/>both the Vaiśya and Mahānandā were sleeping tired
<div n="lb"/>after a hectic amorous sport, the house got fire and the
<div n="lb"/>diamond was burst into pieces. The Vaiśya greatly
<div n="lb"/>griefstricken by the loss of the diamond, jumped into the
<div n="lb"/>fire and committed suicide. Mahānandā faithful to the
<div n="lb"/>promise that she would remain his wife for three days
<div n="lb"/>started to jump into the fire and abandon her life. At
<div n="lb"/>once Śiva appeared before her in person and said thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, Mahānandā, do not commit suicide. I came to
<div n="lb"/>you disguised as a Vaiśya to test your devotion. You
<div n="lb"/>can now ask of me any boon.”
<div n="NI"/>With tears of joy running down her cheeks she said
<div n="lb"/>she wanted to live with Śiva. So Śiva carried her soul
<div n="lb"/>to Kailāsa. Not only that, Śiva blessed the fowl and
<div n="lb"/>monkey and said they would be born as devotees of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>in their next birth and attain mokṣa at the end of their
<div n="lb"/>life on earth. Accordingly the monkey and the fowl were
<div n="lb"/>born in Kashmir as Sudharmā and Tāraka.
