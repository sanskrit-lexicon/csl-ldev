PRAMADVARĀ¦. Wife of Ruru.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Pramadvarā was the daughter of the nymph
<div n="lb"/>Menakā born of the Gandharva Viśvāvasu. As soon
<div n="lb"/>as the child was born, Menakā threw the child into
<div n="lb"/>the forest and left for Devaloka.
[Page601-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Sthūlakeśa, a sage who was engaged in penance in that
<div n="lb"/>forest in a hermitage heard the cry of a child and
<div n="lb"/>came out of his āśrama. On seeing a new-born child
<div n="lb"/>lying unclaimed and uncared for, he took the child to
<div n="lb"/>his āśrama and named her Pramadvarā and brought
<div n="lb"/>her up. She grew into a charming maiden and
<div n="lb"/>one day Prince Ruru coming that way while hunting
<div n="lb"/>saw her and fell in love with her. The sage was pleased
<div n="lb"/>to give her in marriage to the King and so fixed the
<div n="lb"/>date of marriage.
<div n="NI"/>The day previous to her marriage she trampled over
<div n="lb"/>a poisonous snake while walking in the forest with her
<div n="lb"/>companions and immediately she fell dead by the bite
<div n="lb"/>of the serpent. Ruru's grief was uncontrollable.
<div n="lb"/>He wept bitterly crying aloud “If I have from my very
<div n="lb"/>birth with great devotion taken vows, let Pramadvarā
<div n="lb"/>rise up alive.” Then a devadūta (messenger from god)
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and said that all his wails were of
<div n="lb"/>no avail since it was only in the order of things that
<div n="lb"/>one whose āyus (period of life on earth) was over
<div n="lb"/>should die. Ruru then enquired of him a way of escape
<div n="lb"/>from this inevitable calamity and then the devadūta said
<div n="lb"/>that if Ruru was prepared to surrender half of his āyus
<div n="lb"/>in favour of Pramadvarā she would come back to life.
<div n="lb"/>Ruru agreed and they went to Dharmarāja (god of
<div n="lb"/>Death) and told him of his wish. Dharmarāja brought
<div n="lb"/>back Pramadvarā to life and she stood before Ruru
<div n="lb"/>as if just woken up from sleep. Their marriage was duly
<div n="lb"/>conducted. (Chapters 8 and 9, Ādi Parva).
