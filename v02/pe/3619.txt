KRAUÑCA II¦. A mountain. There is a story about this
mountain. Long ago there lived an Asura named
Krauñca. He was leading a wicked life and was
haughty and arrogant. Once Agastya went to Kailāsa
and worshipped Śiva. Kāverīdevī also was standing
close by, worshipping Śiva. God Śiva appeared before
Agastya and told him that he might ask for any boon.
He requested for the power to push down Vindhya by
kicking and to establish a holy Tīrtha (bath) on the
earth. Śiva granted the boons. For making the tīrtha
Śiva turned Kāverī into a river and placed her in the
water-pot of Agastya. As Agastya was returning from
Kailāsa with Kāverī in his water-pot, Krauñca the
Asura took the shape of a mountain and hindered his
way. The Asura caused a heavy rain too. Agastya
wandered through the forest without finding the path
for days. At last he realized the cause. He took a few
drops of water from his waterpot and with chanting of
Mantras and meditation threw the drops at the Asura
with the curse that he would stand there for ever as a
mountain. He said that he would be liberated from the
curse when pierced by the arrow of Subrahmaṇya, the
son of Śiva. From that day onwards Krauñca the Asura
had been standing there as a mountain. That mountain
was called ‘The mountain of Krauñca.’ (Skanda
Purāṇa, Asura Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>There is another statement in Harivaṃśa, Chapter 18,
that the mountain Krauñca was the son of the moun-
tain Maināka, the son of Menā.
<div n="NI"/>Subrahmaṇya fought a terrible battle with the Asuras.
Many died. Bāṇāsura, the son of Mahābali, fled from
the battlefield and hid himself inside the mountain
Krauñca. Subrahmaṇya cleft the mountain into two
with the arrow given by Agni (Fire-god). Thus
Krauñcāsura was liberated from the curse. (M.B. Śalya
Parva, Chapter 46).
<div n="NI"/>In ‘Meghadūta’ Kālidāsa mentions about the cleavage
in the mountain Krauñca. In Mahābhārata, Vana
[Page417-b+ 65]
Parva, Chapter 225, Stanza 33, mention is made that
through this cleavage swans and vultures fly to Mahā-
meru. (For the story of how Paraśurāma cleft the
Krauñca mountain see under Paraśurāma).
