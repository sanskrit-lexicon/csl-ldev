VIṢṆU¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara
are the Lords of creation, sustenance and extermination
of this perishable universe. These trimūrtis (three
figures) also are perishable. It is said, that one day of
Brahmā will constitute thousand four-fold (catur) yugas
and that during the life of Brahmā, fourteen Indras will
fall down from heaven and die. This is a Brahmā age.
The ages of two Brahmās constitute the age of one Viṣṇu.
At the end of the age Viṣṇu also will perish. The age
of Śiva is double the age of Viṣṇu. Śiva also will perish
at the end of his age. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 5).
<div n="NI"/>When everything perishes there comes the deluge (the
great flood). After that, for one hundred and twenty
Brahmā years the universe will be desolate and void. In
that deep eternal silence, Viṣṇu will be seen sleeping on
a banyan leaf on the surface of water. That is the
beginning of the next great age. In this stage, Bāla-
mukunda is the name of Mahāviṣṇu. As he remains on
Nāra or water he will be called Nārāyaṇa also.
<div n="NI"/>The name Viṣṇu means he who possesses the habit of
Vyāpana (To pervade). While Viṣṇu, who has the
power to spread his control over everything in whatever
condition, lies on the banyan-leaf. From his navel, a
lotus-stalk grows up, and on the top of the stalk, in the
lotus flower, Brahmā comes into being. Brahmā does
penance before Viṣṇu and extols him. Mahāviṣṇu confers
on Brahmā the power of creation of the subjects. That
Brahmā perishes along with the deluge and in his place
another Brahmā is born. Thus in the life-time of Viṣṇu
two Brahmās come into being and perish.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Beginning.%} In days of yore, when Viṣṇu was lying
on the banyan leaf as Bāla Mukunda, he began to think
“Who am I? Who created me? Why? What have I
to perform?” -and soon an ethereal voice was heard,
“I am everything. Except me, there is nothing eternal.”
From behind the voice Mahādevī appeared, and said
“Look Viṣṇu. What is there to wonder at? Whenever
the universe is subject to creation, sustenance and
extermination, you have taken origin by the glory of
the Almighty. The Almighty or the omnipotence is
beyond attributes. But we are all subjected to attributes.
Your foremost attribute is Sattva (goodness-purity)
Brahmā whose main attribute is the attribute of rajas
(activity-passions), will originate from your navel.
From the middle of the brows of that Brahmā, Śiva
will be born, whose main attribute is Tamas (inertia
darkness). Brahmā, by the power of Tapas (penance)
will acquire the power of creation and build the world.
You will be the sustainer of that world. Śiva will dest-
roy the same world. I am Devī Māyā (Illusion-
personified as the wife of Brahman), the great power
depending on you for the purpose of creation.” After
hearing these words of Devī, Viṣṇu went into medita-
tion and deep sleep of contemplation.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Avatāras (Incarnations).%} When injustice and law-
lessness abound in the universe, Viṣṇu will incarnate in
the world in various forms and shapes, and will drive
away injustice and will reinstate righteousness. The basis
and the indeclinable semen virile of all the incarnations,
is this spirit of the universe. All Devas, all human beings
and all animals are created from a portion of this soul
of the universe, which in itself is a portion. Brahmā,
first incarnated as Sanatkumāra and lived the life of a
Brahmin student of chaste abstinence. The second
[Page864-b+ 65]
incarnation was connected with the creation of the
earth. It was the incarnation as a hog to redeem the
earth which was immersed in the world of Rasātala.
The third incarnation was taken to create the sages and
hermits. The Supreme God incarnated as the deva-
hermit, Nārada and taught Pañcarātra, the Vaiṣṇava-
śāstra explaining the ways of observing Karmans.
Fourthly, Viṣṇu took the incarnation of Nara-Nārāy-
aṇas (two hermits) and performed tapas (penance),
difficult to do. The fifth incarnation was that of Kapila
who taught his disciple Āsuri, a Brahmin, Sāṅkhya (one
of the six systems of Indian philosophy dealing with
evolution). The next incarnation was taken, according
to the request of Atri, as his son under the name
Dattātreya. Seventhly he took incarnation as Yajña, the
son born to Prajāpati Ruci, by his wife Ākūti with the
groups of devas (gods) such as Yāmas and others to
sustain the Manvantara (age of Manu) of Svāyam-
bhuva. The eighth incarnation was as the son of Bhaga-
vān Nābhi by his wife Meru, and the ninth was, as the
inner soul of Pṛthu, according to the request of the
sages and hermits, with a view to change the earth to
such a state that medicinal herbs may grow in plenty
everywhere. The tenth was, as Matsya (Fish) in
Cākṣuṣa Manvantara deluge; the eleventh, as turtle,
to lift up the mountain Mandara; the twelfth as Dhan-
vantari, and the thirteenth was as Mohinī (Charming
woman). The fourteenth was that of Man-lion, the
fifteenth was that of Vāmana, the sixteenth that of
Paraśurāma, the seventeenth, that of Vyāsa, the eight-
eenth, that of Śrī Rāma and the nineteenth was that of
Rāma and the twentieth that of Kṛṣṇa in the dynasty of
Vṛṣṇi. The twenty-first was as Buddha in the beginning
of the age of Kali. The twenty second incarnation was
in the name of Kalki as the son of the Brahmin Viṣṇu-
yaśas. Each incarnation is explained in places where
that word occurs. See under Avatāra.
<div n="NI"/>The avatāras of Mahāviṣṇu are numerous. Thousands
and thousands of incarnations originate from Mahā-
viṣṇu as streams flow from a lake which overflows at all
times. Hermits, Manus, Devas, Sons of Manus, Prajā-
patis, all these are marks and portions of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Saṛga 15; Agni
Purāṇa, Chapter 5; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
Kāṇḍa, Sarga 40; Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter
83; Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1; M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 121; Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 12; Bhāgavata,
Skandha 10; Bhāgavata, Skandha 5; Mahābhārata,
Vana Parva, Chapter 272; Vana Parva, Chapter 149;
Śānti Parva, Chapter 339).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family life.%} Vaikuṇṭha is the dwelling place of Mahā-
viṣṇu. Mahālakṣmī is the prominent wife. It is seen in
Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, that besides Laksmīdevī,
Gaṅgā Devī and Sarasvatī also were the wives of Viṣṇu.
Lakṣmīdevī has taken several incarnations. Once she
took birth from Khyāti, the wife of hermit Bhrgu. At
this birth Dhātā and Vidhātā were her brothers. On
another occasion, she arose from a lotus-flower which
grew up from the sea of Milk. (To know more about
the wives Lakṣmī, Gaṅgā and Sarasvatī, see under
Gaṅgā).
<div n="NI"/>There is none to be mentioned as the legitimate son of
Mahāviṣṇu. But Brahmā is the first that could be
imagined as the son of Viṣṇu. Besides, Mahāviṣṇu once
created a bright son, by his mind. That son was named
[Page865-a+ 64]
Virajas. Śāstā is another son of Mahāviṣṇu. Śiva be-
came amorous with Mohinī (fascinating woman)—the
form which Mahāviṣṇu took at the time of the churning
of the Sea of Milk. They led a short family life as a
result of which the son Śāstā was born. (See under
Śāstā).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Curses.%} Mahāviṣṇu had cursed and had been cursed
on many an occasion. The most important of them are
given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%The curse of Mahālakṣmī%} Once Mahāviṣṇu looked
into the face of Mahālakṣmī and laughed for no reason.
Thinking that Mahāviṣṇu had been making fun of her,
she cursed him saying “Let your head be severed from
the body.”
<div n="NI"/>At this period an Asura named Hayagrīva had done
penance for a thousand years and obtained several boons.
One boon was that he should be killed only by a man with
the head of a horse. Hayagrīva attacked the devas (gods).
Though the gods fought with Hayagrīva for many thou-
sands of years they could not kill him. Even Viṣṇu,
admitted defeat. Using the bow as a prop to his chin he
stood thinking, for years. In the meanwhile white ants
began to eat the string of the bow. When the string
was broken, the bow straightened with a sudden jerk
and the head of Mahāviṣṇu was severed from the trunk
and was thrown away. Viśvakarmā cut off the head of
a horse and joined it to the trunk of Viṣṇu, who instant-
ly rose up and killed Hayagrīva. Thus satisfying the
need of the gods and making the curse of Lakṣmī come
true, Viṣṇu regained his original form and returned to
Vaikuṇṭha. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%The curse of Bhṛgu.%} The Asuras who were defeated in
the war with Devas, approached Pulomā, the mother of
their teacher-priest Śukra, and sought protection. Pulomā,
was the wife of hermit Bhṛgu. She began to do penance
for the destruction of devas. Knowing this Viṣṇu aimed
his weapon, the Discus, at her and killed her. Bhṛgu
got angry and cursed Viṣṇu to take birth as a man and
suffer the grief of separation from his wife for many
years. This curse was the first cause of the incarnation
of Śrī Rāma. (For details see under Bhṛgu, Para 4).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%The curse of Viṣṇu.%} Once the handsome King Revan-
ta, mounted on the horse Uccaiśśravas and came to
Vaikuṇṭha. Looking at the handsome youth, Lakṣmī
stood for a while enchanted by Revanta and his horse.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu was displeased at this, and cursed her to
take birth on the earth as a mare. Accordingly she was
born as a mare and when the duration of the curse was
over returned to Vaikuṇṭha. (For details see under
Ekavīra).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%The curse of Vṛndā.%} See under Māyāśiva.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Contests and wars.%} Wars are very few in the Purāṇas
in which Viṣṇu had not participated directly or indirect-
ly. As almost all of them have been dealt with in
various places in this book, they are not given here.
Only a few of the prominent among them are mentioned
here.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Madhukaiṭabhas.%} Madhu and Kaiṭabha are two
asuras born from the ear-wax of Mahāviṣṇu. They
tried to attack Brahmā and Viṣṇu killed them. (See
under Kaiṭabha).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Killing of Andhaka.%} Andhaka was a notorious asura.
He was the minister of Mahiṣāsura. When war broke
out between asuras and Devas, Andhaka caused havoc
[Page865-b+ 65]
among the devas. At last in the fight with Viṣṇu
Andhaka was killed. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 5).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Killing of Vṛtrāsura.%} See under Vṛtra.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Rāhu.%} For the story of how Viṣṇu cut into two the
asura Rāhu, see under Amṛtam.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Contest with Brahmā.%} The story of Viṣṇu and
Brahmā making a competitive journey to find out the
crest and foot of Śiva, is given with slight variations in
most of the Purāṇas. (For detailed story see under
Brahmā, Para 5).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%For the story of how Viṣṇu confronted the asuras Nemi,%}
{%Sumālī and Mālyavān%} see under each of those words.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The weapons and ornaments of Viṣṇu.%} The following
are the prominent ornaments and weapons of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Śrīvatsa.%} This is a mark on the chest. It is said that
this is the mark imprinted by the angry Bhṛgu who
kicked on the chest of Mahāviṣṇu. (See under Bhṛgu).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Pāñcajanya.%} This is a white conch. Even by the
touch of this conch man becomes wise. (For further
details see under Pañcaja I).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%The Discus Sudarśana.%} Vajranābha is another
name of this weapon. Viṣṇu uses this weapon to deal
with fierce enemies. This is a wheel with a hole in the
centre and thousand arms going out from the centre.
The outer edge is sharp. This Sudarśana Cakra
is operated by putting it on the first finger and turning
it round, and releasing it at the enemy. Though it is
terrible for the wicked and unjust, it forebodes good to
good people and so it is Sudarśana (good to look at).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Kaumodakī.%} This is the club. The syllable “Ku”
means the earth. Kumodaka means he who delights
the earth. He who makes the earth delightful is Viṣṇu.
As the club is the property of Kumodaka (Viṣṇu) it is
called Kaumodakī.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Kaustubha.%} This is the jewel of Mahāviṣṇu. (Ku =
the Earth. Stubhnāti = Pervades (spreads). Kustubha =
ocean. Kaustubha-obtained from the sea. This jewel
obtained from the sea of milk at the time of its churn-
ing, is worn by Mahāviṣṇu on his neck. This is a red
Jacinth.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Nandaka.%} This is the sword of Viṣṇu. It is stated
in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 166, that this
sword was obtained from Indra.
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Śāraṅg.%} This is the name of the bow of Viṣṇu.
This is called Vaiṣṇavacāpa (the bow of Viṣṇu) also.
A description is given in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla-
kāṇḍa, Sarga 25, as to how this bow was obtained. It
is as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Once the Devas made Viṣṇu and Śiva quarrel with each
other, to test their might. The fight between the two
began. Viśvakarmā gave each of them a bow. The bow
of Viṣṇu was called Vaiṣṇavacāpa; the bow of Śiva
was called Śaivacāpa. This Vaiṣṇavacāpa is Śārṅga.
Due to the power of Śārṅga, Śiva was defeated in the
fight. Getting angry Śiva gave his bow to the King
Devarāta of Videha. It was this bow that Śrī Rāma
broke at the time of the Svayaṃvara marriage of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>After the fight, Viṣṇu gave his bow to Ṛcīka. That bow
changed hands from Ṛcīka to Jamadagni and from him
to Paraśurāma, who presented this bow to Śrī Rāma on
his return after the marriage with Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Vaijayantī.%} This is the necklace of Viṣṇu. This
necklace, made of five jewels stuck together, is known
by the name Vanamālā, also. Viṣṇu has a charioteer
named Dāruka and four horses named Śaibya, Sugrīva,
[Page866-a+ 64]
Meghapuṣpa and Valāhaka. Garuḍa is the conveyance
of Viṣṇu. He holds conch, discus, club and lotus in
each of his four hands. It is said that the discus was
made by Viśvakarmā with the dust of the Sun. In
Viṣṇu Purāṇa particular mention is made about the
ornaments of Viṣṇu.

<div n="NI"/>11) {%Other details%} (i) Mention about Mahāviṣṇu occurs
in several places in Ṛgveda. But more prominence is
given to Indra. Though Viṣṇu is exalted in five Ṛgveda
mantras (incantations), when compared with other gods,
Viṣṇu is only a lesser god. The story of Trivikrama is
hinted in Ṛgveda. But there is no mention about the
incarnation of Vāmana or Mahābali. Ṛgveda gives
Mahāviṣṇu only the position of a younger brother of
Indra. That is why the author of Amarakośa has given
Viṣṇu synonyms such as Upendra, Indrāvaraja etc.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahāviṣṇu was one of those who came to see
Śivaliṅga (Phallus) when it was detached and fell down
at the curse of hermit Bhṛgu. (For details see under

Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Mahāviṣṇu gave Subrahmaṇya the necklace Vaija-
yantī. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 49).
<div n="NI"/>(v) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
11, Stanza 25, that Mahāviṣṇu stays in the assembly of
Brahmā.
[Page867-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Mahāviṣṇu showed grace to Uparicara vasu. (M.B.
Śānti Parva, Chapter 337, Stanza 33).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Mahāviṣṇu once took birth as the son of Aditi.
From that day onwards he got the name Āditya also. (For
details see under Aditi). For further details regarding
Mahāviṣṇu, see under Virāṭpuruṣa, Prakṛti, Puruṣa,
Brahmasṛṣṭi, Avatāra, Amṛta, Garuḍa, Lakṣmī, Gaṅgā
etc.
