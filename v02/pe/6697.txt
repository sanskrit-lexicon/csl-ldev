SOMĀŚRAYĀYAṆA¦. An ancient holy place situated
in the basin of the Gaṅgā. The Pāṇḍavas visited this
holy place while they were on their way to Pāñcāla
from Ekacakrā. It was in this place that Citraratha
the Gandharva who had been defeated by Arjuna, had
enjoyed bathing sports with girls. It was because of
these two facts that Somāśrayāyaṇa became a holy
place. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 169, Verse 3).
