CALĀ¦. Lakṣmīdevī. The following story is told in the
Devī-bhāgavata as to how this name came to be
applied to the devī. Once Revanta the very handsome
son of Sūryadeva came to Vaikuṇṭha riding Uccaiḥ-
śravas, Indra's horse. Devī, who was at that time with
Viṣṇu gazed for a few minutes in wonder at the horse.
She did not, therefore, attend to Viṣṇu's talk. Angered
at this Viṣṇu told the devī: “Since your eyes find
enjoyment on unnecessary things and move about
among such objects, you shall be called from today
onwards Ramā and Calā. Also you will be born as a
mare on earth. Accordingly Mahālakṣmī was born as
a mare on the banks of river Sarasvatī, and regained
her old form only after delivering a son by Viṣṇu. That
son was Ekavīra, founder of the Hehaya kingdom. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 6).
