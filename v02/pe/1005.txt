<div n="NI"/>2) {%Recluse.%} Many years had not lapsed after his coro-
nation as King when, in the heart of Bhagīratha spiri-
tual thoughts began to crop up. A great sage called
Tritula was his guru. Once Bhagīratha asked the guru
what was the means to get rid of worldly sorrows, and
the guru replied as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>The ego will be annihilated when the tendencies and
cravings towards objects of the senses are absolutely
suppressed and the whole and perfect truth is realised
through knowledge, the practice of concentration etc.
The ego will not disappear as long as one does not
become one's real self by completely overcoming the
sense of pride, shame etc. which form the outer case
of worldly life. The egoless state is the ultimate
achievement and most supreme state. Oh! Bhagīratha!
if you would get rid of sentiments like pride etc., give
up all attachment to material objects, become fearless
and gift away, with thoughts concentrated on the inner
self, all your wealth to enemies, and then move among
those enemies, without any sense of ego and pride
about this material body, and take alms from them
(enemies) and also give up me, who am your preceptor
in the matter of knowledge; then you will become the
most sublime Brahma”. This advice of the guru
affected him so much that Bhagīratha, holding his
duties firmly in mind, engaged himself in spiritual
practices, and after spending some time thus he per-
formed, according to rules, the Agniṣṭoma yajña aimed
at gifting away everything. All wealth like cows, land,
horses, gold etc. were distributed in gifts to noble
brahmins and the poor folk according to their eligibi-
lity for the same. Within three days he had gifted away
everything except the clothes he was wearing. And,
then he invited his neighbouring enemy king and gave
to him, without the least hesitation, the kingdom which
had been bereft of all wealth. The ministers and other
citizens felt very sorry about the whole thing. But, Bha-
gīratha left the country at once for other places having
with him only the clothes he was wearing. He spent his
days in various places and forests where he was not
known even by name. Ere long, Bhagīratha attained
ultimate spiritual solace. And, then he accidentally
came to his former kingdom, which was then being
ruled by the enemy King. The ministers and other
citizens to whose houses he went begging for alms
recognised him, and with sorrow unbearable they
appealed to him to accept the throne again and rule
the country. Bhagīratha rejected their request, and,
after staying there for some time, he started for other
places. During this wandering of his he met his old
preceptor, Tritula, and both of them, in company,
toured for some time cities and forests. They felt it very
painful to keep on to their body like that. They
thought like this: “Why should the body be kept like
this. What if this material object continues to exist
or perishes? But let it (the body) continue as long as
it exists without in any way being against the order
of things and ethical practices”. And, in this frame of
mind they traversed the forests. Now, the minister of
a distant kingdom who was on the look out for a
[Page114-b+ 61]
successor to the King who had died heirless, persuaded
Bhagīratha to accept the Kingship of that country. The
ministers of Bhagīratha's former Kingdom also now
requested him to resume his old kingship, especially
since its new ruler had already expired. Bhagīratha
obliged them, and became once again King of his own
country. (Jñānavāsiṣṭham).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhagīrathaprayatnam. (Himālayan or Herculean effort).%}
Sagara, an old predecessor of Bhagīratha had two
wives called Keśinī and Sumati. Keśinī had one son
named Asamañjas and Sumati 60,000 sons. Sagara
once conducted an Aśvamedha yajña in the Indo-
Gangetic plane, when Indra stole away the sacrificial
horse and kept it quite near to sage Kapila who was
doing tapas in Pātāla. The 60,000 sons of Sagara set
out in search of the horse and found it out in Pātāla.
At the sight of the horse they shouted themselves
hoarse. Enraged at this sage Kapila reduced those sons
of Sagara to ashes in the fire which emanated from his
eyes.
<div n="NI"/>After entrusting Asamañjas with the duty of perform-
ing the funeral rites of his 60,000 sons Sagara expired.
Asamañjas transferred that duty on to Aṃśumān, and
he to Bhagīratha. Bhagīratha did penance on the sea-
shore concentrating his mind on Gaṅgādevī. The Devī
appeared before Bhagīratha and asked him to choose
what boon he would, and he requested the Devī to per-
form the funeral rites of 60,000 sons of Sagara remain-
ing in the form of ashes in Pātāla. To this Gaṅgādevī
replied that the earth will not be able to withstand
the impact of her powerful flow, but she shall, if Śiva
permits, flow into his matted hair. And, Gaṅgādevī
asked Bhagīratha to first get that permission. This did
not dishearten Bhagīratha, who went to mount Kailāsa
to do penance so that Śiva might grant him his prayer.
He thus did penance for 1000 years. Śiva appeared to
him and agreed to receive the rushing flow of Gaṅgā
water on his matted head. And, accordingly Śiva stood
in position to receive the rushing waters of Gaṅgā, and
Gaṅgā flowed on to his head. Even the most powerful
flow of Gaṅgā water on his head did not cause Śiva to
move from his position even by a hair's breadth. This
awakened the conceit in Gaṅgādevī, understanding
which Śiva contained her on his head. Without finding
any outlet the waters of river Gaṅgā flowed along the
matted hairs of Śiva for thousand years. So, Bhagi-
ratha had once again to please Śiva. Thus pleased
again Śiva shook his matted head and one drop of
water fell on the ground, and that is the river Ganges
in North India. The Gaṅgā flowed along plane ground
to Pātāla and performed the funeral rites of Sagara's
sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 108; Vālmīki
