ADHARMA¦. A description of the lineage of Adharma
<div n="lb"/>is found in Agni Purāṇa. Hiṃsā (violence) is the
<div n="lb"/>consort of Adharma. The couple procreated two
<div n="lb"/>children, Anṛta and Nikṛti, and from them sprang
<div n="lb"/>up Bhaya (fear), Naraka (Hell), Māyā (illusion),
<div n="lb"/>Vedanā (pain) etc. And, out of them Māyā brought
<div n="lb"/>forth Death, the destroyer of (all) objects. Vedanā, in
<div n="lb"/>its turn produced Sorrow and Grief out of Raurava.
<div n="lb"/>From Death were born Disease, Senility, Sorrow, Intense
<div n="lb"/>desire and Anger. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20).
