<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Rukmakavaca, grandfather of Lomapāda
conquered many countries and gave them all as gifts to
those brahmins who participated in his Aśvamedha-
yajña. He got five brave sons, Rukmeṣu, Pṛthurukma,
Jyāmagha, Parigha and Hari. Of them he made Parigha
and Hari live and rule in Videha. Rukmeṣu ruled his
father's country and Pṛthurukma helped his brother.
Jyāmagha was sent out from his country and he lived
quietly in a hermitage. One day as per the advice of a
sage he left the place in a chariot with a flag flying
to the shores of the river Narmadā. He had neither
servants nor the means for his daily food. He lived on
the mountain Ṛkṣavān eating only roots and fruits. He
was very old and his wife Śaibyā also was getting old.
They had no sons and still Jyāmagha did not marry
again.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Jyāmagha gained a victory in a fight, he
brought a girl and entrusted the child to his wife
saying “This child is your daughter-in-law.” Śaibyā
was surprised and enquired “How can that be when I
have no son?” Jyāmagha replied, “She is to be the wife
of a son who will be born to you soon.” By means of the
hard penance of that girl, Śaibyā got a handsome son
named Vidarbha. Vidarbha married her and got two
wise sons, Kratha and Kaiśika and a third son Loma-
pāda, who was righteous, virtuous and wise. All the
three were great warriors also. Descending in order from
Lomapāda came Babhru-Heti-Kaiśika-Cidi. From this
Cidi came the Cedi dynasty of Kings. (Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa,
Padma Purāṇa, Bhīṣmapulastya Saṃvāda).
