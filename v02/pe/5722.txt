ṚBHUS¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Ṛbhus are a group of divine be-
<div n="lb"/>ings who attained divinity by performing tapas. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 137, Verse 25 says
<div n="lb"/>that even other gods worship the Ṛbhus.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Who were Ṛbhus?%} Aṅgiras, the son of Brahmā had a
<div n="lb"/>son named Sudhanvā. Sudhanvā had three children,
<div n="lb"/>Ṛbhukṣan, Vibhvan and Vāja. These three persons form
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛbhus as mentioned in Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th
<div n="lb"/>Anuvāka, 111th Sūkta.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ṛbhus and Miracles.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Long ago, a cow belonging to a Ṛṣi died. Its calf
<div n="lb"/>began to cry. The Ṛṣi took pity on it and prayed to the
[Page647-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Ṛbhus. They made a cow and covered it with the skin
<div n="lb"/>of the dead cow and placed it in front of the calf. Be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of its likeness to its mother, the calf believed it to
<div n="lb"/>be its mother.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Ṛbhus restored their parents who had become old,
<div n="lb"/>to youth. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka. 11th
<div n="lb"/>Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Ṛgveda says that it was the Ṛbhus who made
<div n="lb"/>Indra's horses, the chariot of the Aśvinīs and Bṛhaspati's
<div n="lb"/>cow.
