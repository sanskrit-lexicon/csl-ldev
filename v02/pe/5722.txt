<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Ṛbhus are a group of divine be-
ings who attained divinity by performing tapas. Mahā-
bhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 137, Verse 25 says
that even other gods worship the Ṛbhus.

began to cry. The Ṛṣi took pity on it and prayed to the

of the dead cow and placed it in front of the calf. Be-
cause of its likeness to its mother, the calf believed it to
be its mother.

to youth. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka. 11th
