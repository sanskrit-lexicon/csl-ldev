YAKṢEŚVARA¦. An incarnation of Śiva. The devas
were puffed with pride when they secured Amṛta by
churning the ocean of milk. In order to allay their
pride, Śiva took birth as Yakṣeśvara.
<div n="NI"/>One day he put a blade of grass on the ground before
them and asked them to take it up. Although
the Devas tried their best, they were not able even to
move it. It was only then that they became convinced
of their own incapacity. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudra
Saṃhitā).
