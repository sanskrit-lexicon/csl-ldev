YAKṢEŚVARA¦. An incarnation of Śiva. The devas
<div n="lb"/>were puffed with pride when they secured Amṛta by
<div n="lb"/>churning the ocean of milk. In order to allay their
<div n="lb"/>pride, Śiva took birth as Yakṣeśvara.
<div n="NI"/>One day he put a blade of grass on the ground before
<div n="lb"/>them and asked them to take it up. Although
<div n="lb"/>the Devas tried their best, they were not able even to
<div n="lb"/>move it. It was only then that they became convinced
<div n="lb"/>of their own incapacity. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudra
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā).
