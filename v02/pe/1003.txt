BHAGAVATĪ¦. The words Bhagavān and Bhagavatī
<div n="lb"/>mean Paramātmā (universal self) and Prakṛti (Nature
[Page113-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and its modifications) respectively. Prakṛti is also
<div n="lb"/>called by the name Śakti. The following elucidation
<div n="lb"/>once given by Mahāviṣṇu about Bhagavān and Bhaga-
<div n="lb"/>vatī is greatly illuminating.
<div n="NI"/>Time, space, atmosphere and the universe (Brah-
<div n="lb"/>māṇḍam) are, just like Paramātmā, eternal. This is the
<div n="lb"/>truth and reality. Below this eternal Gokula exists
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭhaloka, which also is, like the former, eternal.
<div n="lb"/>Just like this, Prakṛti, which is a sport to Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>is also without beginning or end (Sanātanī) too is
<div n="lb"/>eternal. In the same manner as flame exists in fire in-
<div n="lb"/>separable from it, moonlight in moon, beauty in the
<div n="lb"/>lotus flower and brightness in the sun, so does nature
<div n="lb"/>exist in soul inseparable therefrom. In the same way
<div n="lb"/>as the goldsmith cannot make gold ornaments without
<div n="lb"/>gold and the potter cannot make pots without clay, the
<div n="lb"/>Paramātmā will not in the least be able to function
<div n="lb"/>unaided by Prakṛti. Prakṛti (Nature, Devī) is all power-
<div n="lb"/>ful. ‘Para’ becomes powerful enough to do everything
<div n="lb"/>when he joins the Devī.
<div n="NI"/>The sound ‘Śa’ means welfare and good fortune, and
<div n="lb"/>the sound ‘kti’ means prowess. Hence “Śakti” means
<div n="lb"/>the embodiment of welfare and prowess or she, who is
<div n="lb"/>the giver of welfare and prowess. Bhagavatī combines
<div n="lb"/>in herself knowledge, affluence, riches, fame and strength.
<div n="lb"/>As the Paramātmā is always with and inseparable from
<div n="lb"/>such Bhagavatī he is called Bhagavān also. When
<div n="lb"/>Prakṛti and Paramātmā remain combined it is called
<div n="lb"/>Parabrahma, which possesses neither form nor attri-
<div n="lb"/>butes. And, when Prakṛti and Puruṣa separate, of their
<div n="lb"/>own accord, they assume forms and attributes.
<div n="NI"/>The above is Śaiva doctrine in a nut-shell. The
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavas do not accept this position. They ask, “How
<div n="lb"/>is it possible to have brightness or effulgence without
<div n="lb"/>there being an effulgent one?” Therefore, the Vaiṣṇavas
<div n="lb"/>believe in the existence, at the centre of an effulgent
<div n="lb"/>sphere, of a thing possessing the utmost effulgence and
<div n="lb"/>brightness equal to that of Brahmā. This ‘thing’—
<div n="lb"/>Deva—is very efficient and effective to remedy sorrows
<div n="lb"/>due to birth, death, disease etc. and to him the life-
<div n="lb"/>time of Brahma is just one minute only. This Deva is
<div n="lb"/>called Paramātmā, Parabrahma and Kṛṣṇa by the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavas. ‘Kṛṣ’ means maximum devotion (love)
<div n="lb"/>towards Paramātmā, and ‘ṇa’ means he who becomes
<div n="lb"/>slave to such devotion. Hence Kṛṣṇa means he who
<div n="lb"/>becomes a slave to the love of his devotees. There is
<div n="lb"/>another meaning also for the word Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣ means
<div n="lb"/>all and ‘ṇa’ means seed or root; and thus Kṛṣṇa means
<div n="lb"/>he, who is the root of everything. In the very begin-
<div n="lb"/>ning there was only this Kṛṣṇa; and this Lord, sub-
<div n="lb"/>ject only to his own will and pleasure, divided him-
<div n="lb"/>self into two, the left side becoming woman and the
<div n="lb"/>right side man. (Devī Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
