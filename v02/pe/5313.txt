PRAMOHINĪ¦. A Gandharva maiden. Pramohinī and
<div n="lb"/>four Gandharva maidens were absolved from their cur-
<div n="lb"/>ses by a drop of water from the river Narmadā. The
<div n="lb"/>story recounted to Yudhiṣṭhira by Nārada is as follows:
<div n="lb"/>Five Gandharva maidens Pramohinī, Suśīlā, Susvarā,
<div n="lb"/>Candrikā and Sutārā were friends. Pramohinī was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Śukasaṅgīti, Suśīlā that of Suśīla, Susvarā
<div n="lb"/>of Svaravedī, Candrikā that of Candraka and Sutārā
<div n="lb"/>of Suprabha. On a day in spring all the five went about
<div n="lb"/>collecting flowers in a forest. As they went on walking
<div n="lb"/>they reached the pond named Acchoda. They bathed in
<div n="lb"/>that pond and after that made an idol of Ambikā with
[Page602-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>clay and adorned it with golden ornaments. Putting
<div n="lb"/>marks on it with Kumkum (Saffron) and Candana (San-
<div n="lb"/>dalwood-paste) they danced around the idol with devo-
<div n="lb"/>tional songs. As they were doing so, the eldest son of
<div n="lb"/>sage Vedanidhi came to bathe in the Acchoda pond.
<div n="lb"/>He was very charming to look at with eyes like lotus,
<div n="lb"/>broad chest and round and brawny hands. He looked
<div n="lb"/>like another Kāmadeva (Cupid). He was wearing a
<div n="lb"/>deer-hide and around his waist was a yellow waist-band
<div n="lb"/>of Muñja grass. The five girls were attracted by the
<div n="lb"/>ascetic youth and stopping their dancing they at first
<div n="lb"/>thought of making him their guest. The more the girls
<div n="lb"/>looked at him the more they saw a resemblance of Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>deva in him and they decided to make him their hus-
<div n="lb"/>band. The girls started to approach him with amorous
<div n="lb"/>looks and perplexed by this move, the ascetic youth
<div n="lb"/>fled away from the place. The girls searched for him
<div n="lb"/>everywhere and he was not to be found. They found an
<div n="lb"/>emptiness on all sides. They thought that perhaps he
<div n="lb"/>might be a magician. They felt themselves in the plight
<div n="lb"/>similar to that of the gopīs who searched for the missing
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. Somehow taking courage they reached their homes
<div n="lb"/>and fell down before their mothers. The mothers asked
<div n="lb"/>them why they were so late and they replied they knew
<div n="lb"/>not the passage of time speaking with the Kinnarīs who
<div n="lb"/>arrived there. Their bodies were hot and the mothers
<div n="lb"/>thought that it might be due to their brisk walking for
<div n="lb"/>such a long distance.
<div n="NI"/>Telling a lie like that to hide their secret, they lay on
<div n="lb"/>the ground thinking about him and him alone. They
<div n="lb"/>did not make the Kelīmayūra (peacock kept for pleas-
<div n="lb"/>ure) dance, did not teach the parrot in the cage, did
<div n="lb"/>not pet the mongoose nor did they converse with
<div n="lb"/>their pet Śārikā. The night seemed to them like a yuga
<div n="lb"/>and as soon as it was morning they ran up to the Acchoda
<div n="lb"/>pond. The brahmin boy came there that morning also
<div n="lb"/>for bathing. The five girls encircled him and requested
<div n="lb"/>him to marry them. He made several excuses and tried
<div n="lb"/>to get away from them. Then Pramohinī breaking the
<div n="lb"/>circle went and caught hold of him by his legs, Suśīlā
<div n="lb"/>and Susvarā caught hold of his hands, Sutārā embraced
<div n="lb"/>him and Candrikā kissed him on his cheeks. At last in des-
<div n="lb"/>pair the brahmin boy cursed them and turned them into
<div n="lb"/>devils. The girls were not to be subdued like that. They
<div n="lb"/>also cursed him in return and made him also a devil.
<div n="lb"/>All the devils formed like that by curses and counter-
<div n="lb"/>curses lived in the same place in the forest. After a
<div n="lb"/>long time one day the sage Lomaśa came that way by
<div n="lb"/>chance and the burning effulgence of Lomaśa due to his
<div n="lb"/>severe penance made him unapproachable to the devils
<div n="lb"/>and they stood at a great distance from him. But the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin devil by the strength of his penance in his
<div n="lb"/>previous life knew Lomaśa and falling before him in
<div n="lb"/>prostration told him everything that had happened.
<div n="lb"/>Lomaśa was greatly moved by his story and he took
<div n="lb"/>them to the banks of the river Narmadā. At that time
<div n="lb"/>a wind blew and drops of water from the river, changed
<div n="lb"/>them into their original forms and they stood praising
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā. Then following the advice of Lomaśa the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy married the five girls and lived on the
<div n="lb"/>shores of Narmadā bathing in it, drinking its water and
<div n="lb"/>worshipping it. They lived there for long happily and
<div n="lb"/>then attained Viṣṇuloka. (Chapter 22, Padma Purāṇa)
