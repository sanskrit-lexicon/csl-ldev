SATYAKĀMA¦ (SATYAKĀMA JĀBĀLA). A noble her-
<div n="lb"/>mit. There is a story as given below, in the Chāndog-
<div n="lb"/>yopaniṣad about the greatness of this hermit.
<div n="NI"/>As his father died in his boyhood, Satyakāma was
<div n="lb"/>brought up by his mother Jābālī. Whan it was time to
<div n="lb"/>begin education, the boy told his mother, “Mother, I
<div n="lb"/>would like to be educated under a teacher, in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas. But I don's know what clan I belong to.
<div n="lb"/>What answer shall I give, when the teacher asks me
<div n="lb"/>about my clan?” His mother Jābālī replied. “I also
<div n="lb"/>do not know much about the clan of your father who
<div n="lb"/>married me when I was a girl. From that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>I was engaged in house-keeping. I did not ask your
<div n="lb"/>father about the clan. In my younger days I gave birth
<div n="lb"/>to you. Shortly after that your father died. Tell your
<div n="lb"/>teacher that you are Satyakāma the son of Jābālī.”
<div n="NI"/>Having heard this Satyakāma went in search of a
<div n="lb"/>teacher. At last he reached the hermitage of the sage
<div n="lb"/>Gautama and told him every thing. The hermit was
<div n="lb"/>attracted by his truthfulness and behaviour. Believing
<div n="lb"/>that Satyakāma was a Brahmin boy, Gautama accepted
<div n="lb"/>him as a disciple. The hermit entrusted the boy with
<div n="lb"/>four hundred lean cows to look after. The boy accepted
<div n="lb"/>the work, and said to the hermit. “When this becomes
<div n="lb"/>a group of thousand fat cows, I will bring them back.”
<div n="lb"/>He lived in the forest looking after the cows. The Devas
[Page706-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sympathised with him. Vāyu (wind), the Sun, Agni
<div n="lb"/>(fire) and Prāṇa together gave him divine knowledge and
<div n="lb"/>wisdom. After this Satyakāma returned to the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Gautama with thousand fat cows. Seeing the boy whose
<div n="lb"/>face shone with the light of God, the hermit was
<div n="lb"/>amazed. “Who gave you divine knowledge?” asked
<div n="lb"/>the hermit. Satyakāma told the hermit all that took
<div n="lb"/>place. Fully satisfied with the boy, Gautama imparted
<div n="lb"/>to him knowledge about the universal Soul (Paramātmā)
<div n="lb"/>and Satyakāma became a noble hermit.
<div n="NI"/>Satyakāma got several disciples of whom Upakosala
<div n="lb"/>was prominent. He approached Satyakāma as a student.
<div n="lb"/>For twelve years he served his teacher and kept up the
<div n="lb"/>fire in the firepit for burnt offering, without being ex-
<div n="lb"/>tinguished throughout the twelve years, and worshipped
<div n="lb"/>the fire god. Yet the teacher did not impart knowledge
<div n="lb"/>to him. The teacher's wife recommended to her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band that Upakosala should be given learning. But the
<div n="lb"/>teacher was silent. Upakosala took a vow and fast
<div n="lb"/>before the burnt-offering fire pit. Agni Deva felt pity for
<div n="lb"/>him and informed him that God is all-pervading and
<div n="lb"/>that his teacher would show him the way to God. When
<div n="lb"/>he came to the teacher, his face was seen shining.
<div n="lb"/>Satyakāma asked Upakosala for the reason. Upakosala
<div n="lb"/>told the teacher what the fire god had told him.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately Satyakāma taught his disciple the path of
<div n="lb"/>yoga (union) by knowledge of the Sāṅkhyas.
