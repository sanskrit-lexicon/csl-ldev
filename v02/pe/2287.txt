ELI¦ AND PŪCCA. (Eli = rat, Pūcca = Cat).
<div n="NI"/>The story of the cat and the rat described by the poet
<div n="lb"/>Kuñjan Nambiār is from Kathāsaritsāgara. The story
<div n="lb"/>in original is the following.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived on a big banyan tree near the city of
<div n="lb"/>Vidiśā a mongoose, an owl, a cat and a rat. The mon-
<div n="lb"/>goose and the rat lived in two separate hollows at the
<div n="lb"/>foot of the tree, the cat in a cavity in the centre of the
<div n="lb"/>tree and the owl on the branches at the top. Of these
<div n="lb"/>the rat could be eaten by all the other three and the cat
<div n="lb"/>could kill all the rest. The rat and the mongoose afraid
[Page270-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>of the cat did stir out only during night time and the
<div n="lb"/>cat moved about day and night afraid of none wishing
<div n="lb"/>to catch hold of the rat and eat it. Their common place
<div n="lb"/>of activity was a rice-field nearby.
<div n="NI"/>Once a forester laid a net to catch the cat and the cat
<div n="lb"/>fell into the trap and lay there hanging inside the net.
<div n="lb"/>The rat coming that way saw the plight of the cat and
<div n="lb"/>jumped with joy. But soon the owl and the mongoose
<div n="lb"/>came to the spot and seeing their enemy, the cat, impṛi-
<div n="lb"/>soned rushed to catch hold of the rat. The rat then did
<div n="lb"/>a very clever thing. It went and tore open the net
<div n="lb"/>imprisoning the cat and when the cat jumped out of the
<div n="lb"/>net the owl and the mongoose ran away and disappear-
<div n="lb"/>ed. The rat went to its hole. This is a story to
<div n="lb"/>demonstrate the fact that with a change in the situation
<div n="lb"/>an enemy may turn out to be a friend. (Taraṅga 7,
<div n="lb"/>Madanamañcukālaṃbaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
