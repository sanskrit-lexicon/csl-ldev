CAKRAVYŪHA¦. A Phalanx.
<div n="NI"/>A particular pattern of army formation on ground. In
<div n="lb"/>the Kaurava-Pāṇḍava war Droṇācārya formed a Cakra-
<div n="lb"/>vyūha wherein Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna got himself
[Page167-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>trapped and killed. (Abhimanyu, who forced himself
<div n="lb"/>inside the Vyūha did not know the method of get-
<div n="lb"/>ing out of it which Arjuna alone knew). Cakravyūha is
<div n="lb"/>made in the form and shape of Cart-wheels. Vyāsa has
<div n="lb"/>described the Cakravyūha made by Droṇa as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>The great preceptor made the Cakravyūha and posted
<div n="lb"/>in it to maximum capacity kings, who were equal to
<div n="lb"/>Indra. In every opening of the vyūha were posted
<div n="lb"/>princes equal in prowess to the Sun. All the princes
<div n="lb"/>were organised compactly. And, all of them wore red
<div n="lb"/>uniforms and were adorned with other things also red
<div n="lb"/>in colour and held red flags. They also wore golden
<div n="lb"/>ornaments and garlands scented with Sandal paste.
<div n="lb"/>Ten thousand strong they rushed forward to fight with
<div n="lb"/>Abhimanyu. Duryodhana's son, Lakṣmaṇa, led the
<div n="lb"/>onrush. In the centre (of the Cakravyūha) stood
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana in the company of heroes like Karṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Duśśāsana and Kṛpa. And, at the head of the army
<div n="lb"/>stood Droṇa, the captain of the army, who looked like
<div n="lb"/>the rising sun. Then there was the King of Sindhu,
<div n="lb"/>and near him stood Aśvatthāmā, and there stood in
<div n="lb"/>front of them thirty Kauravas, all of them equal to
<div n="lb"/>Devas. On the flanks were great heroes like Śalya,
<div n="lb"/>Bhūriśravas. And then did the battle rage. (Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 34).
