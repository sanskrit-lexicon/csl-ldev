CAKRAVYŪHA¦. A Phalanx.
<div n="NI"/>A particular pattern of army formation on ground. In
the Kaurava-Pāṇḍava war Droṇācārya formed a Cakra-
vyūha wherein Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna got himself
[Page167-a+ 64]
trapped and killed. (Abhimanyu, who forced himself
inside the Vyūha did not know the method of get-
ing out of it which Arjuna alone knew). Cakravyūha is
made in the form and shape of Cart-wheels. Vyāsa has
described the Cakravyūha made by Droṇa as follows:—
The great preceptor made the Cakravyūha and posted
in it to maximum capacity kings, who were equal to
Indra. In every opening of the vyūha were posted
princes equal in prowess to the Sun. All the princes
were organised compactly. And, all of them wore red
uniforms and were adorned with other things also red
in colour and held red flags. They also wore golden
ornaments and garlands scented with Sandal paste.
Ten thousand strong they rushed forward to fight with
Abhimanyu. Duryodhana's son, Lakṣmaṇa, led the
onrush. In the centre (of the Cakravyūha) stood
Duryodhana in the company of heroes like Karṇa,
Duśśāsana and Kṛpa. And, at the head of the army
stood Droṇa, the captain of the army, who looked like
the rising sun. Then there was the King of Sindhu,
and near him stood Aśvatthāmā, and there stood in
front of them thirty Kauravas, all of them equal to
Devas. On the flanks were great heroes like Śalya,
Bhūriśravas. And then did the battle rage. (Droṇa
Parva, Chapter 34).
