KALPA III¦. The customary proceedings of Yāgas.
These proceedings are made in the form of Sūtras. The
Sūtras describe how the Brāhmaṇas and mantras are
to be used. For each Saṃhitā there are separate
Śrauta Sūtras. The Śrauta Sūtras for Ṛgveda Saṃhitā
are Āśvalāyana, Śāṃkhāyana and Śaunaka. Those for
Sāmaveda are Maśaka, Lāṭyāyana and Drāhyāyaṇa.
Those for Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda are Āpastamba Bauddhā-
yana, Satyāṣāḍha, Hiraṇyakeśī, Mānava, Bhāradvāja,
Vādhūla, Vaikhānasa, Laugākṣi, Maitra, Kaṭha and
Vārāha. For Śuklayajurveda it is Kātyāyana Srauta
Sūtra. For Atharvaveda it is Kauśika Śrauta Sūtra.
All these Sūtras contain only brief symbolic words and
are difficult to understand without explanation.
