UNMĀDINĪ¦. A beautiful woman. She was the daughter
of a Vaiśya in the city of Śrāvastī. He went to the King
Devasena and requested him to marry his daughter.
Because of the interference of his favourites, the King
did not marry her. The King's general married her.
Once the King happened to see her by chance. When
he saw how beautiful she was, he felt sorry that he did
not marry her. From that day onwards the King grew
morbidly torpid and finally died.

Udayana, the King of Vatsa. (Kathāsaritsāgara,
Lāvāṇakalambaka; Taraṅga 1).
