DITI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A daughter of Dakṣa Prajāpati. She was
married to Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of
Marīci. She had many sisters, chief among whom were
Aditi, Kālā, Danāyus, Danu, Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pṛthā,
Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā, Muni and Kadrū. Kaśyapa's
sons by Aditi became Devas (Āditeyas) and his sons
by Diti became Asuras (Daityas). (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indra cut Diti's embryo to pieces.%} Devas and Asuras
agreed to churn the ocean of milk as a joint endeavour.
But when Amṛta rose up to the surface, they began to
quarrel over it. In the battle between Devas and
Asuras for the possession of Amṛta, Diti's sons were
killed.
<div n="NI"/>In her inconsolable grief at the death of her sons, Diti
prayed to her husband Kaśyapa that she should be
blessed with a brave and heroic son who would be
capable of killing Indra. The sage granted her the
boon and told her that by worshipping the lord with a
pure mind and body for a hundred years, she would
bear a son who would be mighty enough to kill Indra.
In due course Diti became pregnant and following her
husband's advice, she fervently worshipped the Lord
and remained pure in mind and body. When Indra
came to know that the child in Diti's womb was to be
his slayer, he approached her under the disguise of an
attendant, offering to serve her. He waited for an
[Page244-b+ 65]
opportunity to get access to her and before the expiry
of a hundred years he got a chance. One day, Diti
went to bed without washing her feet and fell asleep.
Indra took his Vajra and gaining access to her womb
cut the embryo within it into seven pieces. The child
in the womb began to cry loudly. Indra asked it
“MĀ RUDA” (Do not cry). Then he proceeded to
cut each of the seven pieces again into seven and
finally there were fortynine pieces in all. They subse-
quently became Devas known as “Maruts.” They got
the name Maruts because Indra told them “Mā Ruda.”
All the fortynine Maruts later on became the helpers
of Indra. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 21).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Diti's sons.%} Asuras were Diti's sons. Chief among
them were Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa. They had
a sister named Siṃhikā. Hiraṇyakaśipu had four
sons—Anuhlāda, Hlāda, Prahlāda and Saṃhlāda who
were famous for their glory and might. Śūrapadma,
Siṃhavaktra, Tārakāsura, Gomukha and Ajāmukha
were also Diti's sons. Of them, Śūrapadma had four
sons by his wife Mayasutā, who were Bhānukopa,
Agnimukha, Vajrabāhu and Hiraṇya. An asura named
Mahāśūra was born to Siṃhavaktra by his wife,
Vibhūti. The Asuras, Śambara, Śakuni, Dvimūrdhā,
Śaṅku, Aśva, were the sons of Hiraṇyākṣa. Siṃhikā
married Vipracitti; Rāhu and Ketu were born to them.
Saṃhlāda, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu had three sons,
Āyuṣmān, Śibi and Bāṣkala. Virocana was the son of
Prahlāda; Mahābali was the son of Virocana; Bāṇa
was born to Mahābali and to Bāṇa were born four
crores of Nivātakavacas. All these were the prominent
children of Diti. Besides them, Diti had crores of other
Asuras born to her. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter
3; Harivaṃśa, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa.%} Hiraṇyakaśipu
and Hiraṇyākṣa were the rebirth of Jaya and Vijaya,
the two gate-keepers of Mahāviṣṇu. (See under Jaya).
There is a story as to how they were born as the sons
of Diti.
<div n="NI"/>Diti was one of the wives of Kaśyapa. She had no
children while the other wives of Kaśyapa had children.
Jealousy and grief rankled in her mind. One day she
approached Kaśyapa and pressed him to beget a son
for her. It was the time of dusk when Kaśyapa was
deeply absorbed in his day's devotional worship. She
disturbed his “Dhyāna” (devotional concentration) by
her importunity, but he was reluctant to yield to her
wishes at such an inauspicious time. It is at dusk that
Śiva goes about with his attendant hordes of spirits,
wearing the crown of his matted hair covered with the
dust carried by the whirlwinds from cremation grounds
and keeping his three eyes wide open. Kaśyapa asked
Diti to wait for a few minutes, until that terrible time
was over, but she did not heed his advice. In the fury
of her passion she sprang towards him and stripped
him of his clothes and in the end Kaśyapa yielded to
her carnal desires. But after the act he in a repentant
mood told her that she had defiled her mind by having
sexual union in that unholy hour and by doing so had
sinned against the gods. As a result, twin sons will be
born in her womb. They would persecute and torture
the three worlds. Mahāviṣṇu would incarnate to
destroy them. But since she also felt a little regret in
her act, a grandson of her (Prahlāda) will become a
devotee of Viṣṇu.
[Page245-a+ 65]
Twin sons, Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa were born
to Diti. For the rest of the story, see under Hiraṇya-
kaśpu and Hiraṇyākṣa. (Bhāgavata, Prathama Skan-
dha).
<div n="NI"/>5) Diti flourishes in the assembly of Brahmā. (M.B.
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, verse 39.)
