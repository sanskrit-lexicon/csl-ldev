DITI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A daughter of Dakṣa Prajāpati. She was
<div n="lb"/>married to Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of
<div n="lb"/>Marīci. She had many sisters, chief among whom were
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, Kālā, Danāyus, Danu, Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pṛthā,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā, Muni and Kadrū. Kaśyapa's
<div n="lb"/>sons by Aditi became Devas (Āditeyas) and his sons
<div n="lb"/>by Diti became Asuras (Daityas). (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indra cut Diti's embryo to pieces.%} Devas and Asuras
<div n="lb"/>agreed to churn the ocean of milk as a joint endeavour.
<div n="lb"/>But when Amṛta rose up to the surface, they began to
<div n="lb"/>quarrel over it. In the battle between Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Asuras for the possession of Amṛta, Diti's sons were
<div n="lb"/>killed.
<div n="NI"/>In her inconsolable grief at the death of her sons, Diti
<div n="lb"/>prayed to her husband Kaśyapa that she should be
<div n="lb"/>blessed with a brave and heroic son who would be
<div n="lb"/>capable of killing Indra. The sage granted her the
<div n="lb"/>boon and told her that by worshipping the lord with a
<div n="lb"/>pure mind and body for a hundred years, she would
<div n="lb"/>bear a son who would be mighty enough to kill Indra.
<div n="lb"/>In due course Diti became pregnant and following her
<div n="lb"/>husband's advice, she fervently worshipped the Lord
<div n="lb"/>and remained pure in mind and body. When Indra
<div n="lb"/>came to know that the child in Diti's womb was to be
<div n="lb"/>his slayer, he approached her under the disguise of an
<div n="lb"/>attendant, offering to serve her. He waited for an
[Page244-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>opportunity to get access to her and before the expiry
<div n="lb"/>of a hundred years he got a chance. One day, Diti
<div n="lb"/>went to bed without washing her feet and fell asleep.
<div n="lb"/>Indra took his Vajra and gaining access to her womb
<div n="lb"/>cut the embryo within it into seven pieces. The child
<div n="lb"/>in the womb began to cry loudly. Indra asked it
<div n="lb"/>“MĀ RUDA” (Do not cry). Then he proceeded to
<div n="lb"/>cut each of the seven pieces again into seven and
<div n="lb"/>finally there were fortynine pieces in all. They subse-
<div n="lb"/>quently became Devas known as “Maruts.” They got
<div n="lb"/>the name Maruts because Indra told them “Mā Ruda.”
<div n="lb"/>All the fortynine Maruts later on became the helpers
<div n="lb"/>of Indra. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 21).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Diti's sons.%} Asuras were Diti's sons. Chief among
<div n="lb"/>them were Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa. They had
<div n="lb"/>a sister named Siṃhikā. Hiraṇyakaśipu had four
<div n="lb"/>sons—Anuhlāda, Hlāda, Prahlāda and Saṃhlāda who
<div n="lb"/>were famous for their glory and might. Śūrapadma,
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhavaktra, Tārakāsura, Gomukha and Ajāmukha
<div n="lb"/>were also Diti's sons. Of them, Śūrapadma had four
<div n="lb"/>sons by his wife Mayasutā, who were Bhānukopa,
<div n="lb"/>Agnimukha, Vajrabāhu and Hiraṇya. An asura named
<div n="lb"/>Mahāśūra was born to Siṃhavaktra by his wife,
<div n="lb"/>Vibhūti. The Asuras, Śambara, Śakuni, Dvimūrdhā,
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅku, Aśva, were the sons of Hiraṇyākṣa. Siṃhikā
<div n="lb"/>married Vipracitti; Rāhu and Ketu were born to them.
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhlāda, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu had three sons,
<div n="lb"/>Āyuṣmān, Śibi and Bāṣkala. Virocana was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda; Mahābali was the son of Virocana; Bāṇa
<div n="lb"/>was born to Mahābali and to Bāṇa were born four
<div n="lb"/>crores of Nivātakavacas. All these were the prominent
<div n="lb"/>children of Diti. Besides them, Diti had crores of other
<div n="lb"/>Asuras born to her. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>3; Harivaṃśa, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa.%} Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>and Hiraṇyākṣa were the rebirth of Jaya and Vijaya,
<div n="lb"/>the two gate-keepers of Mahāviṣṇu. (See under Jaya).
<div n="lb"/>There is a story as to how they were born as the sons
<div n="lb"/>of Diti.
<div n="NI"/>Diti was one of the wives of Kaśyapa. She had no
<div n="lb"/>children while the other wives of Kaśyapa had children.
<div n="lb"/>Jealousy and grief rankled in her mind. One day she
<div n="lb"/>approached Kaśyapa and pressed him to beget a son
<div n="lb"/>for her. It was the time of dusk when Kaśyapa was
<div n="lb"/>deeply absorbed in his day's devotional worship. She
<div n="lb"/>disturbed his “Dhyāna” (devotional concentration) by
<div n="lb"/>her importunity, but he was reluctant to yield to her
<div n="lb"/>wishes at such an inauspicious time. It is at dusk that
<div n="lb"/>Śiva goes about with his attendant hordes of spirits,
<div n="lb"/>wearing the crown of his matted hair covered with the
<div n="lb"/>dust carried by the whirlwinds from cremation grounds
<div n="lb"/>and keeping his three eyes wide open. Kaśyapa asked
<div n="lb"/>Diti to wait for a few minutes, until that terrible time
<div n="lb"/>was over, but she did not heed his advice. In the fury
<div n="lb"/>of her passion she sprang towards him and stripped
<div n="lb"/>him of his clothes and in the end Kaśyapa yielded to
<div n="lb"/>her carnal desires. But after the act he in a repentant
<div n="lb"/>mood told her that she had defiled her mind by having
<div n="lb"/>sexual union in that unholy hour and by doing so had
<div n="lb"/>sinned against the gods. As a result, twin sons will be
<div n="lb"/>born in her womb. They would persecute and torture
<div n="lb"/>the three worlds. Mahāviṣṇu would incarnate to
<div n="lb"/>destroy them. But since she also felt a little regret in
<div n="lb"/>her act, a grandson of her (Prahlāda) will become a
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Viṣṇu.

<div n="lb"/>Twin sons, Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa were born
<div n="lb"/>to Diti. For the rest of the story, see under Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśpu and Hiraṇyākṣa. (Bhāgavata, Prathama Skan-
<div n="lb"/>dha).
<div n="NI"/>5) Diti flourishes in the assembly of Brahmā. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, verse 39.)
