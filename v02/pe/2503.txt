GRAHAS¦ (PLANETS). Indians from very ancient days
<div n="lb"/>have maintained certain definite ideas and inferences
<div n="lb"/>about the planets. Though those ideas differ somewhat
<div n="lb"/>from the results of modern researches, the influence of
<div n="lb"/>the ancient ideas is discernible in all the Purāṇic texts in
<div n="lb"/>India. The main ideas are summarised below.
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Śukra (Venus), Budha
<div n="lb"/>(Mercury), Kuja (Mars), Bṛhaspati (Jupiter), Śani
<div n="lb"/>(Saturn), Rāhu and Ketu are the navagrahas (the nine
<div n="lb"/>planets).

<div n="lb"/>Besides the above nine planets, Indian astronomers take
<div n="lb"/>into account a starry sphere in the sky called Saptarṣis
<div n="lb"/>and the star called Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Sūrya.%} The sun gives light to all the other planets.
<div n="lb"/>It has an area of 50 crore yojanas and its distance from
<div n="lb"/>the earth is 22 crore yojanas. Śūrya exists within the
<div n="lb"/>universe, and is called also Mārtaṇḍa as it originated
<div n="lb"/>from dead (mṛta) egg (aṇḍa). Sūrya divides the sky,
<div n="lb"/>heaven, hell, the earth, east, west, north, south etc.
<div n="lb"/>from one another. According to the course of Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>three periods of time or ‘seasons’ like uttarāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>dakṣiṇāyana and viṣuvat are caused. Five months from
<div n="lb"/>May is the uttarāyaṇa period, five months from
<div n="lb"/>November the dakṣiṇāyana period, and the months of
<div n="lb"/>April and October are the Viṣuvats. Since during the
<div n="lb"/>uttarāyaṇa the sun rises up comparatively slowly
<div n="lb"/>(mandagati) during this period the day is longer than
<div n="lb"/>night. As in dakṣiṇāyana the course of the sun is quic-
<div n="lb"/>ker in pace (Śīghragati) night is longer than day, and
<div n="lb"/>during viṣuvat, (samagati) day and night are of equal
<div n="lb"/>duration.
<div n="NI"/>The other planets have three positions called Jaradgava,
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata and Vaiśvānara, the first being the central
<div n="lb"/>position, the second the northern position and the
<div n="lb"/>third the southern position. Nine stars, Aśvinī, Bharaṇī,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛttikā, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasu and
<div n="lb"/>Puṣya occupy the Airāvata vīthī (northern position
<div n="lb"/>or segment). Another nine stars, Maghā, Pūrva
<div n="lb"/>Phalgunī, Uttara Phalgunī, Hasta, Citrā, Svātī,
<div n="lb"/>Viśakhā, Anurādhā and Jyeṣṭhā occupy the central
<div n="lb"/>position, and the last nine stars, Mūla, Purvāṣāḍha,
<div n="lb"/>Uttarāṣāḍha, Śravaṇa, Śraviṣṭhā, Śatabhiṣak, Pūrva-
<div n="lb"/>proṣṭhapada, Uttaraproṣṭhapada and Revatī occupy the
<div n="lb"/>southern position.
<div n="NI"/>To the east, south, west and north of Mount Mahāmeru
<div n="lb"/>exist Devadhānikā (Indrapurī) Saṃyamanī (Yamapurī)
<div n="lb"/>Ṅimlocanī (Varuṇapurī) and Vibhāvarī (Kuberapurī)
<div n="lb"/>respectively. When Sūrya appears in Devadhānikā it
<div n="lb"/>will be dawn, when he has travelled to Saṃyamanī it
<div n="lb"/>will be noon, when he is in Nimlocanī it will be sunset
<div n="lb"/>and when he is in Vibhāvarī it will be mid-night. This
<div n="lb"/>is how Śurya circles the Mahāmeru. Within 15 nāḍikās
<div n="lb"/>(6 hours) the sun travels 2(1/2) crores plus 2(1/2) lakhs of
<div n="lb"/>yojanas. Sūrya's chariot has one wheel and twelve
<div n="lb"/>spokes. The wheel represents a year and the twelve
<div n="lb"/>spokes stand for the twelve months of the year. The
<div n="lb"/>chariot has also three nābhis representing the three
<div n="lb"/>cāturmāsyas, and six bands representing the six
<div n="lb"/>seasons. The height of the chariot is 36 lakhs yojanas
<div n="lb"/>and it has a width of 8 yojanas inside. Aruṇadeva is the
<div n="lb"/>charioteer, and the seven chandas are the horses. The
<div n="lb"/>seven chandas are, Gāyatrī, Bṛhatī, Uṣṇik, Jagatī,
<div n="lb"/>Triṣṭubh, Anuṣṭubh and Paṅkti).
<div n="NI"/>Night is called Uṣā and day Vyuṣṭi and the time in
<div n="lb"/>between is Sandhyā. When Sandhyā begins the terrible
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas called Mandehas attempt to consume Sūrya.
<div n="lb"/>They have been granted the boon that everyday they
<div n="lb"/>will be dying though they may not be losing their
<div n="lb"/>bodies. So, everyday there rages a fierce fight between
<div n="lb"/>them and Sūrya. When the fight is on, noble brahmins
<div n="lb"/>throw up water sanctified by Gāyatrī mantra with
<div n="lb"/>‘Om’. The water turns into Vajrāyudha and burns the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas to ashes. The first offering in Agnihotra is
<div n="lb"/>made with the recitation of the mantra beginning
<div n="lb"/>‘Sūryo Jyoti’ because of which the sun is able to shine
[Page296-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>with thousands of rays with the result that the Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>are burned to death. The Bālakhilyas who number
<div n="lb"/>more than 60,000 form Sūryā's body-guard. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya for Purāṇīc stories about him).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Candra. (The Moon).%} Candra exists at one lakh
<div n="lb"/>yojanas away from Sūrya, and it revolves round the
<div n="lb"/>earth. A cāndra month of twentyseven days is divided
<div n="lb"/>into twelve rāśis (houses) viz. Siṃha (Leo), Kanyā
<div n="lb"/>(Virgo) Tulā (Libra) Vṛścika (Scorpio) Dhanus
<div n="lb"/>(Sagittarius) Makara (Capricorn) Kuṃbha (Aquarius)
<div n="lb"/>Mīna (Pisces) Meṣa (Aries) Vṛṣabha (Taurus)
<div n="lb"/>Mithuna (Gemini) and Karkaṭaka (Cancer). Every
<div n="lb"/>month Candra stays in each of the above houses only
<div n="lb"/>for 2(1/4) days.
<div n="NI"/>The full moon makes Pitṛs happy, divides the month
<div n="lb"/>into two halves, Kṛṣṇa Pakṣa (the dark fortnight)
<div n="lb"/>and Śukla Pakṣa (the bright fortnight) and functions
<div n="lb"/>as the very life of all living beings. The twentyseven
<div n="lb"/>stars from Aśvinī to Revatī are the wives of Candra.
<div n="lb"/>There is another view that Candra has twentyeight
<div n="lb"/>wives including another star called Abhijit. Candra has
<div n="lb"/>another name, Sarvamaya. Candra with his pleasing
<div n="lb"/>rays, as sweet as Amṛta (Nectar) bestows happiness on
<div n="lb"/>devas, Pitṛs and all other living beings. So he is called
<div n="lb"/>Sarvamaya.
<div n="NI"/>Candra's chariot has three wheels. Ten beautiful horses
<div n="lb"/>white as Jasmine flowers draw the chariot. These
<div n="lb"/>horses also like those of Sūrya live for a Kalpa era.
<div n="lb"/>Because the Devas drink its digits Candra wanes into
<div n="lb"/>one digit (Kalā). Then Sūrya makes him wax again
<div n="lb"/>with one single ray of his called Suṣumnā. When only
<div n="lb"/>two Kalās of his remain Candra enters the orbit of
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya and stays there in the ray called ‘amā’, and that
<div n="lb"/>day, therefore is called amāvāsyā. And on that day
<div n="lb"/>Candra enters waters for the first time, and after that
<div n="lb"/>dwells in trees, creepers etc. While Candra is thus in
<div n="lb"/>trees etc. those who cut them will be committing the
<div n="lb"/>sin of brahmahatyā. (slaughter of a brahmin). When
<div n="lb"/>only a little of the 15th kalā remains on new moon day
<div n="lb"/>hordes of Pitṛs gather round the enfeebled Candra to
<div n="lb"/>drink him, and they drink the amṛta kalā, one of the
<div n="lb"/>two kalās still remaining with him. Thus the three
<div n="lb"/>classes of Pitṛs, Barhiṣadas, Saumyas and Agniṣvāttas
<div n="lb"/>get absolutely satisfied for one month. Thus Candra
<div n="lb"/>nurtures Devas in the Śukla Pakṣa and pitṛs in Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>Pakṣa, and grows trees, creepers etc. with life-giving
<div n="lb"/>water. (For details see under Candra).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śukra (Venus).%} Śukra is an auspicious Deva very
<div n="lb"/>much interested in doing good to the world and making
<div n="lb"/>people happy. His course is also, like that of Śūrya, of
<div n="lb"/>three types, intense (quick), slow and of equal pace.
<div n="lb"/>Two-and-a-half yojanas above Sūrya, Śukra follows a
<div n="lb"/>course alternating in front of and behind Sūrya. Śukra
<div n="lb"/>never goes very far away from Śūrya, and he possesses
<div n="lb"/>a big chariot drawn by horses from earth. (For details
<div n="lb"/>see under Śukra).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Budha (Mercury).%} Though inherently auspicious
<div n="lb"/>Budha, in contact with inauspicious planets takes their
<div n="lb"/>character and becomes weak. Budha also has the three
<div n="lb"/>paces, quick, slow and medium. Budha moves close to
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya and if he moves from Sūrya storms, failure of
<div n="lb"/>rain etc. will be the result. He is considered to be the
<div n="lb"/>son of Candra. His chariot is made of wind and fire,
<div n="lb"/>golden in colour and is drawn by eight horses having
<div n="lb"/>the speed of wind. (See under Budha for more details).
[Page297-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kuja (Mars).%} Kuja is two lakhs of yojanas above
<div n="lb"/>Budha, and remains in every rāśi (house) more or less
<div n="lb"/>for 45 days. When the position is affected it causes
<div n="lb"/>inauspicious experiences to living beings. The chariot
<div n="lb"/>of Kuja is made of gold, glittering and of huge size.
<div n="lb"/>Eight horses born from Agni draw the chariot.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Bṛhaspati (Jupiter).%} Jupiter travels 2 lakhs of yojanas
<div n="lb"/>away from Kuja's sphere. Though it is an auspicious
<div n="lb"/>planet its reverse course is productive of evil results.
<div n="lb"/>Jupiter travels for twelve months in every rāśi (house).
<div n="lb"/>His golden chariot is drawn by eight white horses. (See
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Śani (Saturn).%} Śani is 2 lakhs of yojanas away from
<div n="lb"/>Jupiter's sphere, and it stays in every house for twenty
<div n="lb"/>months. As it moves only slowly it is called Śanaiścara
<div n="lb"/>also. Śani is considered to be the son of Sūrya. It is an
<div n="lb"/>inauspicious planet. His chariot is drawn by multi-
<div n="lb"/>coloured horses born in the sky.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Rāhu.%} His ash-coloured chariot is drawn by eight
<div n="lb"/>horses as dark as beetles. Once the horses are harness-
<div n="lb"/>ed to the chariot it will always be running. On full
<div n="lb"/>moon days Rāhu starts from Sūrya and reaches Candra
<div n="lb"/>and returns to Sūrya on new moon days. It is an inaus-
<div n="lb"/>picious planet. (For details see under Rāhu).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Ketu.%} His chariot is drawn by eight horses, which
<div n="lb"/>have the speed of wind. It is also an inauspicious
<div n="lb"/>planet.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Saptarṣis.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
<div n="lb"/>zone of Śani exists the Saptarṣi zone. Seven maharṣis
<div n="lb"/>are incessantly on the move in that sphere, wishing all
<div n="lb"/>that is well for the whole world. (See Saptarṣis).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Dhruva.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
<div n="lb"/>saptarṣimaṇḍala there is a place called Viṣṇupada.
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva, son of Uttānapāda lives there in the company
<div n="lb"/>of Indra, Agni, Kaśyapa, Dharma and others. The
<div n="lb"/>Dhruvamaṇḍala remains there stationary like the
<div n="lb"/>supporting pillar of all the planets ever on the move.
<div n="lb"/>(See Dhruva; Devībhāgavata 8th Skandha; Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Part II).
<div n="NI"/>Astrologers aver that living beings pass through the
<div n="lb"/>periods and positions of the following planets, viz. Ketu,
<div n="lb"/>Śukra (Venus) Āditya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Kuja
<div n="lb"/>(Mars), Rāhu, Bṛhaspati (Jupiter), Śani (Saturn) and
<div n="lb"/>Budha (Mercury). The following table shows how
<div n="lb"/>people born under different stars pass through the
<div n="lb"/>different daśās. The order of succession of the daśās
<div n="lb"/>and the period of each daśā can also be seen from this
<div n="lb"/>table.
<div n="NI"/>Stars (Day of birth)
<F>1. To find out your daśā at the time of birth, please see the above table. Any one born under any of the stars is considered born
<div n="lb"/>in the daśā shown in the right hand side against that star; e. g. People born under (Aśvayuk) Aśvinī, Mṛgaśīṛṣa and Mūla are born
<div n="lb"/>into the Ketu daśā. So with the other stars also as shown in the above table. To calculate how long the daśā into which a particular person
<div n="lb"/>is born will last requires some astrological skill; also the exact time of birth should be known. A star remains dominant for about 24
<div n="lb"/>hours. If a man is born under a star when half this period of dominance is over, then that man will get only half the period of the corres-
<div n="lb"/>ponding daśā. The portion of the daśā that the man will get is proportionate to the period of dominance of the star. For example,
<div n="lb"/>a man is born under the star Aśvainī (Aśvyuk) when the star is in the last quarter of the Ketu daśā. The total period of this daśā is
<div n="lb"/>7 years. But the man will get only the last quarter of it, namely about 1(3/4) years. After that he will pass on to the next daśā—Śukra-
<div n="lb"/>daśā.</F> <C n="2"/>Daśā <C n="3"/>Years
