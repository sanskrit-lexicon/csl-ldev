SĀTVIKA¦. A brahmin, who was turned into a Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>due to a curse after he had entered heaven. His story
[Page703-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>has been told by sage Śaunaka to Bharata, brother of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>It was Bharata, who led the yājñic horse towards the
<div n="lb"/>north in connection with the Aśvamedha yajña perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed by Śrī Rāma after he was crowned King. The
<div n="lb"/>horse, which started on its journey from Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>reached, after six months, Hemakūṭa on the limits of
<div n="lb"/>India. As soon as it got into a beautiful garden it was
<div n="lb"/>rendered stationary as though paralysed. All attempts to
<div n="lb"/>make the horse move failed. Śatrughna and some sol-
<div n="lb"/>diers tried to lift the horse by its legs, to no purpose.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān bound its legs with his tail and pulled, again
<div n="lb"/>to no purpose, and surprised at this failure of his he
<div n="lb"/>spoke to Śatrughna and others thus. “It was only just
<div n="lb"/>now that I pulled out with my tail the Droṇa mountain
<div n="lb"/>so very easily; but this small horse does not stir at all.
<div n="lb"/>May be, it is all fate.” Following Hanūmān's speech,
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna asked Sumālī the explanation for this state of
<div n="lb"/>the matter, but the latter could not find one for it. Then
<div n="lb"/>it was decided to find out a maharṣi and ask him for
<div n="lb"/>the explanation. The soldiers accompanied by Bharata
<div n="lb"/>went in search of a maharṣi, reached Śaunaka's āśrama
<div n="lb"/>and submitted the case to him.
<div n="NI"/>The maharṣi remained in meditation for some time and
<div n="lb"/>the condition of the horse became vivid in his mind.
<div n="lb"/>Then he spoke as follows:—“There was once a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Sātvika in Gauḍa(?) land on the banks of river
<div n="lb"/>Kāverī. Once he began performing tapas. He spent
<div n="lb"/>three days. drinking only water the first day, consuming
<div n="lb"/>air the next day and fasting completely the third day.
<div n="lb"/>He continued his tapas repeating the above course until
<div n="lb"/>one day he entered samādhi (expired). He got into
<div n="lb"/>a decorated plane sent from Devaloka, went to the peak
<div n="lb"/>of mount Meru and thence came to river Jambū, which
<div n="lb"/>flowed from the great Jambū tree on the mountain.
<div n="lb"/>There in Jambū were many maharṣis, who had acquired
<div n="lb"/>merit by bathing in the golden water of the river, en-
<div n="lb"/>joying all comforts in the company of apsarā women.
<div n="lb"/>Sātvika, one day, haughty with the thought that he was
<div n="lb"/>the master of the maharṣis, did something which quite
<div n="lb"/>displeased the latter, and they cursed him. When he
<div n="lb"/>prayed for absolution from the curse they told him thus:
<div n="lb"/>“When you paralyse the feet of Śrī Rāma's horse, you
<div n="lb"/>will happen to hear Rāma's story and then you will be
<div n="lb"/>redeemed from curse.”
<div n="NI"/>On Śaunaka informing them thus that it was the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin transformed into a Rākṣasa, who had para-
<div n="lb"/>lysed the legs of the horse, Bharata returned to the
<div n="lb"/>horse and recited the story of Rāma and immediately an
<div n="lb"/>effulgent person came there in a plane and said, “Oh.
<div n="lb"/>intelligent King! I have now heard the story of Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and so have become pure; so, please let me go to
<div n="lb"/>heaven.” After saying this he returned. Bharata and
<div n="lb"/>others were pleased to know that the visitor was Sātvika
<div n="lb"/>brahmin. The horse became free from its paralysed
<div n="lb"/>condition. The party resumed its journey. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Pātālakhaṇḍa, Chapters 47 and 48).
