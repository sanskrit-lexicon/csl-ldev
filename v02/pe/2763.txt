INDRĀṆĪ¦. Wife of Indra (Śacī).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Viṣṇu—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Kaśyapa—Pulomā—Śacī (Indrāṇī). Pulomā
<div n="lb"/>was an asura born to Kaśyapa by his wife Danu. Indra
<div n="lb"/>married Śacī, the daughter of Pulomā, and hence Śacī
<div n="lb"/>is called Indrāṇī also. She is called Paulomī also as she
<div n="lb"/>was the daughter of Pulomā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indrāṇī and Śūrapadma.%} An Asura called Śūrapadma
<div n="lb"/>once coveted Indrāṇī. He deputed his men to fetch
<div n="lb"/>Śacī somehow or other to him. Hearing about this,
<div n="lb"/>Indra, keeping Indrāṇī with him, went to and stayed in
<div n="lb"/>the Chīyāli temple in Koṅkaṇadeśa, and afterwards
<div n="lb"/>Indra went to Mount Kailāsa after asking Śāstā to
<div n="lb"/>guard Indrāṇī. During Indra's absence Ajāmukhī,
<div n="lb"/>sister of Śūrapadma met Indrāṇī and induced her to
<div n="lb"/>become Śūrapadma's wife. Indrāṇī refused. Ultimately
<div n="lb"/>Indra returned and took Indrāṇī back to Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indrāṇī and Nahuṣa.%} See under Agastya.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Indrāṇī and Pāñcālī.%} Mahābhārata says that Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>was a partial incarnation of Indrāṇī. (See under Pāñcālī).
<div n="lb"/>A part of Śacī was born in the family of Drupada as
<div n="lb"/>Draupadī, viz. Pāñcālī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>(1) Indrāṇī once went to the assembly of Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>worshipped him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 42).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When once Satyabhāmā came to Devaloka with
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Indrāṇī conducted her to Aditi, mother of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 36).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Śacī also was present at the birth of Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Indrāṇī and Arjuna. (See under Arjuna).
