GAVIJĀTA¦. (ŚṚṄGĪ). The son of a sage named
<div n="lb"/>Nāgabhūṣaṇa, Gavijāta cursed that King Parīkṣit
<div n="lb"/>should die of snake-bite. The curse was made under
<div n="lb"/>the following circumstances.
<div n="NI"/>King Parīkṣit went hunting one day in the forest and
<div n="lb"/>he who had chased a deer in hot haste for some dis-
<div n="lb"/>tance felt naturally very weak and tired, and requested
<div n="lb"/>a sage he saw there in the forest for some water.
<div n="lb"/>Immersed in meditation the sage did not hear the King,
<div n="lb"/>and mistaking him to be a haughty fellow, the King,
<div n="lb"/>with his stick, lifted a dead snake and placed it round
<div n="lb"/>the neck of the sage. Yet he did not stir. The King
<div n="lb"/>returned to his palace.

<div n="NI"/>Gavijāta, son of the sage and a devotee of Devī heard
<div n="lb"/>of the insult heaped on his father's head while he was
<div n="lb"/>merry-making in the forest with his companions. The
<div n="lb"/>companions derided him by saying that though his
<div n="lb"/>father was Nāgabhūṣana (having snakes as ornament)
<div n="lb"/>the nāga was I feless. Enraged at this and not waiting
<div n="lb"/>to study details about the incident he pronounced the
<div n="lb"/>following curse. “Whoever might be the person who
<div n="lb"/>threw a dead snake about my father's neck, he will be
<div n="lb"/>bitten to death by Takṣaka within seven days from
<div n="lb"/>today.” Only after the curse was pronounced did he
<div n="lb"/>understand that it was King Parīkṣit who had become
<div n="lb"/>the object of the curse. And, he despatched his disciple
<div n="lb"/>immediately to Parīkṣit to inform him about the curse.
<div n="lb"/>The King's reaction was, “when the time for death
<div n="lb"/>comes let me die.” (Devī Bhāgavata, Dvitīya
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
