SUDEVĀ III¦. The wife of Ikṣvāku who was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Manu. This Sudevā was the daughter of Devarāta the
<div n="lb"/>King of Kāśī. Ikṣvāku and Sudevā are said to be the
<div n="lb"/>incarnations of Viṣṇu and Devī Lakṣmī respectively.
<div n="lb"/>While the couple were walking about in the forest, they
<div n="lb"/>saw a she-hog. That hog was the cursed form of a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin woman named Sudevā. Sudevā, the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku gave the merits she had earned in one year by
<div n="lb"/>her good deeds to Sudevā the she-hog and liberated her
<div n="lb"/>from her curse. This story occurs in Padma Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapter 42. The story is given below:
<div n="NI"/>Once King Ikṣvāku and his wife Sudevā were hunting
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of the Gaṅgā. Then a big hog came there
<div n="lb"/>with his wife and children. The hog was afraid of
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku. So he said to his wife:—“Look! beloved!
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku the valiant, the son of Manu, is come for hunt-
<div n="lb"/>ing. I am going to fight with him.” His wife said. “How
<div n="lb"/>did you get this bravery to fight with the king, you who
<div n="lb"/>always try to evade the forest-men?” “It is not
[Page753-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>bravery, my love. It is because I could go to heaven if
<div n="lb"/>I fight with the king valiantly and meet with heroic
<div n="lb"/>death”, replied the hog. The wife tried her utmost to
<div n="lb"/>dissuade her husband from his attempt. The children
<div n="lb"/>also tried to stop him. They could not change his mind.
<div n="lb"/>So all of them decided to help him as much as they
<div n="lb"/>could in his fight. They got ready for a fight against
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku and his army.
<div n="NI"/>The king's army saw the preparations of the hogs and
<div n="lb"/>their resolute stand. Struck with fear, they informed
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku about it. The king ordered the noble hog to be
<div n="lb"/>caught. Ikṣvāku and his wife mounted on horse and
<div n="lb"/>followed the army. All the hounds ran towards the
<div n="lb"/>hogs barking. The army sent a volley of arrows at the
<div n="lb"/>hogs. The hog and his wife stopped the arrows. The
<div n="lb"/>army could not defeat the hogs. At last the king him-
<div n="lb"/>self killed the hog with a club. While the king was
<div n="lb"/>looking on, that noble hog was changed to a noble
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva with four hands and divine clothes and
<div n="lb"/>ornaments. Leaving his old body of hog on the earth
<div n="lb"/>he rose up into the sky like the Sun and went to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing this sight Sudevā was struck with fear. She got
<div n="lb"/>down from the chariot and called the wife of the hog
<div n="lb"/>towards her. The wife of the hog, wounded all over,
<div n="lb"/>came to the queen Sudevā. Sudevā asked her about
<div n="lb"/>the previous history of her dead husband. The hog's
<div n="lb"/>wife said: “Lady! If you feel interested I shall tell you
<div n="lb"/>about the previous life of my dead husband and my-
<div n="lb"/>self.”
<div n="NI"/>“My dead husband was a Gandharva named Raṅkavidyā-
<div n="lb"/>dhara, in the previous birth. Once he sat in the shade of
<div n="lb"/>a tree near the hermitage of Pulastya and began to sing
<div n="lb"/>with accompaniment. As the singing caused disturbance
<div n="lb"/>to his solitude the hermit Pulastya came and requested
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharva to shift to some other place. Raṅkavid-
<div n="lb"/>yādhara did not like to comply with the request
<div n="lb"/>of the hermit. At last Pulastya removed his hermitage
<div n="lb"/>to another place. Raṅkavidyādhara walked in search
<div n="lb"/>of Pulastya. Finally the Gandharva saw Pulastya.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing that he was alone, the Gandharva took the shape
<div n="lb"/>of a hog and entered the hermitage and began to wound
<div n="lb"/>with his tusk and to molest that radiant sage Pula-
<div n="lb"/>stya. Thinking it to be a mere animal Pulastya suffered
<div n="lb"/>it for a long time. The hog continued its actions of
<div n="lb"/>molestation. It passed excrements in front of the sage,
<div n="lb"/>danced before him, played in front of him, fell down in
<div n="lb"/>the courtyard and rolled and did various other things.
<div n="lb"/>As it was an animal Pulastya forgave him. One day
<div n="lb"/>Raṅkavidyādhara entered the hermitage as a hog, roared
<div n="lb"/>aloud, laughed aloud, cried aloud, sang aloud and in
<div n="lb"/>various other ways tried to change the mind of the her-
<div n="lb"/>mit. Seeing all these, Pulastya began to think that it
<div n="lb"/>was not a hog. “A hog will not try to molest one con-
<div n="lb"/>tinuously. I forgave him thinking him to be a mere
<div n="lb"/>animal. This must be that wicked Gandharva.” Thus
<div n="lb"/>recognizing him Pulastya got angry and cursed him
<div n="lb"/>thus: “You tried to violate my penance in the shape of
<div n="lb"/>a hog. So you, great sinner; take the next birth as a
<div n="lb"/>hog.” With grief the Gandharva ran to Indra and in-
<div n="lb"/>formed him of everything. Indra requested Pulastya
<div n="lb"/>to liberate the Gandharva from the curse. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Pulastya gave him remission that he would regain his
<div n="lb"/>original form when he was killed by the hands of the
<div n="lb"/>immensely good king Ikṣvāku.”
[Page754-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Sudevā was amazed on hearing this story of the dead
<div n="lb"/>hog, and asked her again. “You hog! You speak like a
<div n="lb"/>human being. How is it?”
<div n="NI"/>The wife of the hog continued the story. “Lady! I also
<div n="lb"/>have taken rebirth as a hog. In my previous birth I was
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of a Brahmin named Vasudatta (Vāsudeva)
<div n="lb"/>in the city of Śrīpura in Kaliṅga. They named me
<div n="lb"/>Sudevā (Vasudevā). Because of the unlimited caressing
<div n="lb"/>and fondling of my father I grew up as an arrogant
<div n="lb"/>girl. In the meanwhile a Brahmin youth named Śiva-
<div n="lb"/>śarmā, who was well-versed in all the branches of know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge, and whose parents were dead, came to my house.
<div n="lb"/>My father gave me to that brahmin. I lived with him
<div n="lb"/>in my father's house. Being proud of the wealth and
<div n="lb"/>prosperity of my parents I did not care to render the
<div n="lb"/>services due to my husband. My husband who was a
<div n="lb"/>peaceful man bore everything. By and by I became wicked.
<div n="lb"/>At last because of my wickedness and immorality my
<div n="lb"/>husband left the country. My father hated me and
<div n="lb"/>expelled me from the house. My father feared that
<div n="lb"/>some calamity would happen to me as Kaṃsa was born
<div n="lb"/>to Padmāvatī, the wife of Ugrasena, by her illegal con-
<div n="lb"/>nection with persons other than her husband.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing about the birth of Kaṃsa, Sudevā asked the
<div n="lb"/>she-hog to tell her about the circumstances which led to
<div n="lb"/>the illegal connections of Padmāvatī. The wife of the
<div n="lb"/>hog continued. “In days of old there was a king in
<div n="lb"/>Mathurāpurī named Ugrasena, who married Padmāvatī
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of king Satyaketu of Vidarbha. While the
<div n="lb"/>couple were living happily in Mathurāpurī Satyaketu
<div n="lb"/>wanted to see his daughter. He sent a messenger to
<div n="lb"/>Mathurāpurī and brought Padmāvatī to Vidarbha. She
<div n="lb"/>walked along the vicinity of the palace in which she was
<div n="lb"/>born, enjoying the beauty of the scenery. She walked on
<div n="lb"/>and arrived on the mountain called Puṣpavān, and sat
<div n="lb"/>on the bank of a lake. At that time a Gandharva named
<div n="lb"/>Godila (Dramila) came there. He fell in love with her.
<div n="lb"/>He took the shape of Ugrasena and came near her and
<div n="lb"/>talked with her. Thinking that her husband had come
<div n="lb"/>from Mathurā to see her she embraced him. After a
<div n="lb"/>while she understood that the visitor was not her
<div n="lb"/>husband. She began to curse him. The visitor admitted
<div n="lb"/>that he was Godila an attendant of Vaiśravaṇa. Godila
<div n="lb"/>went on his way. But she had become pregnant by that
<div n="lb"/>time. Her parents tried in various ways to destroy the
<div n="lb"/>child in her womb. One day the infant lying in her
<div n="lb"/>womb told her thus: “Mother! you do not know who
<div n="lb"/>I am. I am the rebirth of a powerful asura named
<div n="lb"/>Kālanemi. In ancient days Viṣṇu killed me in a battle
<div n="lb"/>between the gods and asuras. I have entered into your
<div n="lb"/>womb for revenge. Mother! you need not take the
<div n="lb"/>trouble to destroy me.” Saying so, the infant stopped
<div n="lb"/>speaking. After ten years Padmāvatī gave birth to the
<div n="lb"/>mighty and strong Kaṃsa. He was killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and he attained heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>Sudevā was struck with wonder at the story of Kaṃsa.
<div n="lb"/>She asked the she-hog to continue her own story. She
<div n="lb"/>continued her own story. “I have said that my father
<div n="lb"/>expelled me. Being shameless I walked away from there
<div n="lb"/>soon. Nobody helped me. Those who saw me scolded
<div n="lb"/>me. Days passed. Afflicted by a horrible disease, and
<div n="lb"/>travelling in this manner, I came to a big house. I
<div n="lb"/>entered the courtyard and begged for alms. It was the
<div n="lb"/>house of my husband Śivaśarmā. When I abandoned
<div n="lb"/>him he married another woman named Maṅgalā and
[Page754-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>was leading a prosperous life. Maṅgalā gave me food.
<div n="lb"/>Śivaśarmā asked me who I was. I told him my story.
<div n="lb"/>He remembered me, his former wife. Maṅgalā also felt
<div n="lb"/>compassion for me. They gave me gold ornaments and
<div n="lb"/>made me stay there. But my conscience pricked me.
<div n="lb"/>Thus burning internally I died.
<div n="NI"/>My soul went to hell. After the suffering of a very long
<div n="lb"/>period, I took birth again as a Jackal. Then I became
<div n="lb"/>a dog, and then a snake. After that I passed through
<div n="lb"/>the births of a hen, a cat and a rat. Thus Brahmā had
<div n="lb"/>put me in the wombs of all kinds of animals. Now I have
<div n="lb"/>taken the birth of a she-hog. Lady! Your husband
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku is the incarnation of Viṣṇu in portion and your-
<div n="lb"/>self, that of Lakṣmī in portion. If you would give me
<div n="lb"/>the merits you have earned for one day by your good
<div n="lb"/>deeds, I could leave off all these mean births and attain
<div n="lb"/>heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>The eyes of Sudevā were full when she heard the story
<div n="lb"/>of the hog. She gave to the she-hog, the merits she had
<div n="lb"/>earned by good deeds for one year. The hog was changed
<div n="lb"/>to a divine woman of youth and beauty. Immediately
<div n="lb"/>a divine chariot came down from heaven and took her
<div n="lb"/>to heaven, while everybody was looking on. Ikṣvāku
<div n="lb"/>and Sudevā returned to their palace much pleased at
<div n="lb"/>the redemption of the she-hog.
