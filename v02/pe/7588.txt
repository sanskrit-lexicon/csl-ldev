TRIPURA¦. A phantom city built by Maya.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Kaśyapa Maharṣi son of Marīci and grand-
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā had many wives. Of them Aditi got the
<div n="lb"/>first place and Diti the second place. Both of them were
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Dakṣa Devas were born of Aditi and the
<div n="lb"/>asuras were born of Diti. Armies of asuras under the
<div n="lb"/>leadership of Śūrapadma, Siṃhavaktra, Tārakāsura,
<div n="lb"/>Gomukha, Hiraṇyākṣa, and Hiraṇyakaśipu gave immense
<div n="lb"/>trouble to the devas. The devas joined together under
<div n="lb"/>the leadership of Indra and fought the asuras. The
<div n="lb"/>nectar received from the ocean of Milk always made
<div n="lb"/>the devas the conquerors. When Subrahmaṇya slew
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāsura the asuras became very weak.
[Page793-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>At this stage Kamalākṣa, Tārakākṣa and Vidyunmālī,
<div n="lb"/>sons of Tārakāsura, did severe penance and made Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>appear before them. They demanded a boon that they
<div n="lb"/>would never be killed by anybody in any of the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds. Brahmā told them to ask any boon other than
<div n="lb"/>that. Then they said: “Great Lord, we must live in
<div n="lb"/>three cities and then roam about freely in the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds by your grace. Every thousand years all the
<div n="lb"/>three of us should join together at a place with our
<div n="lb"/>cities. After that meeting, we should separate and roam
<div n="lb"/>about freely for another thousand years. If at all there
<div n="lb"/>is death for us, it should occur only when we three
<div n="lb"/>are together and that also by one arrow.” Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>granted the boon and disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>The asuras then approached Maya and asked him to
<div n="lb"/>construct three separate cities for them. Maya built
<div n="lb"/>three wonderful cities. One was with gold, another
<div n="lb"/>with silver and the third with iron. Tārakākṣa took
<div n="lb"/>the golden one, Kamalākṣa took the silver one and
<div n="lb"/>Vidyunmālī took the iron one. The asuras started
<div n="lb"/>living in these cities. The three puras were respectively
<div n="lb"/>in Svarga, Ākāśa and the Earth. But each city had the
<div n="lb"/>power to travel to any other place at will. The power
<div n="lb"/>of controlling these cities was given to Bāṇa. Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu's son was Prahlāda. Prahlāda's son was Viro-
<div n="lb"/>cana. Mahābali was Virocana's son and Bāṇa was
<div n="lb"/>Mahābali's son (Chapter 14, Padma Purāṇa). All these
<div n="lb"/>three cities together were named Tripura.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mṛtasañjīvanī Vāpī.%} (The life giving tank). Even
<div n="lb"/>with the existence of Tripura the asuras began to die in
<div n="lb"/>numbers and the Tripuras thought of a way to escape
<div n="lb"/>from this calamity. Hari, son of Tārakāsura, did penance
<div n="lb"/>and made Brahmā appear before him in person.
<div n="lb"/>According to a request from Hari Brahmā made Maya
<div n="lb"/>build a tank wonderful in nature. Brahmā filled the
<div n="lb"/>tank with nectar. If any asura died, it was enough if he
<div n="lb"/>was dipped in the tank and the dead asura would soon
<div n="lb"/>come to life with added strength and vigour. Asuras
<div n="lb"/>became immortal since this and the Tripuras started
<div n="lb"/>teasing the devas and men with increased ferocity.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Consultation with Śiva.%} The aggrieved devas approach-
<div n="lb"/>ed Brahmā and finding him incapable of helping took
<div n="lb"/>him to Śiva. Śiva heard everything and assured them
<div n="lb"/>that he would kill them when they next met together at
<div n="lb"/>the end of a thousand years.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śiva makes preparations.%} As a first step to the slaughter
<div n="lb"/>of the Tripuras, Śiva sent Nārada to Tripura. Nārada
<div n="lb"/>by his unusual spiritual powers made the asura women
<div n="lb"/>feel more and more attached to the devas. Śiva at that
<div n="lb"/>time thinking about the convenience for a fight with
<div n="lb"/>the Tripuras came and settled down on the shores of
<div n="lb"/>the river Narmadā. That was how Narmadā became
<div n="lb"/>a holy river. (Chapter 13, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Śiva had to make grand preparations for a fight with
<div n="lb"/>the Tripuras. He invoked half the strength of the devas
<div n="lb"/>to himself to make Śivaśakti (Javelin of Śiva) greater
<div n="lb"/>than Asuraśakti. The devas made Viśvakarmā construct
<div n="lb"/>a special chariot for Śiva. On the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā at a place which became renowned as
<div n="lb"/>Maheśvara Śiva stayed for a thousand years thinking
<div n="lb"/>about the fight with the Tripuras. He made the mount-
<div n="lb"/>ain of Mandara his bow, Vāsuki, the string and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu his arrow. He installed Agni at the tip and Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>at the bottom of the arrow. Four devas stood as horses
<div n="lb"/>to his chariot. The earth itself was the chariot and all
[Page794-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the animate and inanimate objects of the devaloka
<div n="lb"/>arrayed at different parts of the chariot. On the wheels
<div n="lb"/>stood the Aśvinīdevas and Cakrapāṇi stayed on the
<div n="lb"/>axle. Gandharvas took places on the spokes. Indra
<div n="lb"/>stayed on the bow and Vaiśravaṇa on the arrow. Yama
<div n="lb"/>took his place on the right hand and the dreadful Kāla
<div n="lb"/>on the left hand. Brahmā acted as the charioteer.
<div n="NI"/>Equipped thus, Śiva stayed in the godly chariot for a
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. When the three cities joined together
<div n="lb"/>in the sky Śiva split the cities by his three forked spike.
<div n="lb"/>Then he sent an arrow to the cities. Bad omens began
<div n="lb"/>to appear in Tripura. People became lifeless in the
<div n="lb"/>cities. Soon an arrow from Śiva burnt the cities and
<div n="lb"/>the Tripuras were burnt to death. (7th Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata; Chapters 31 to 34, Padma Purāṇa; Chapters
<div n="lb"/>33 and 34, Karṇa Parva).
