TAKṢAKA I¦. A fierce serpent.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descending in order from
Viṣṇu—Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Takṣaka.
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapamuni got of his wife Kadrū serpents and
Takṣaka was one of the serpent chiefs. (Śloka 5, Chap-
ter 35, Ādi Parva). See also under Kadrū).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Takṣaka and Parīkṣit.%} In his boyhood Takṣaka went
out from the family. The reason was a curse by his
mother. Once Kadrū and Vinatā, another wife of
Kaśyapa, entered into a controversy regarding the
colour of the hair of the tail of the horse Uccaiśśravas.
Kadrū said, it was black and Vinatā said it was white.
It was decided that she who lost the wager should
become the servant of the other. That night Kadrū
called her children and asked them to go and hang on
the tail of the horse so that it should appear black.
Some of the righteous children opposed this deceitful
attempt of their mother and refused to go. Kadrū
cursed them saying that they would be burnt to death
at the Sarpasatra of Janamejaya. Kadrū sent those
children out from home and Takṣaka became their
leader.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Parīkṣit (King of Bhārata) became the
victim of a curse that he would die by the bite of
Takṣaka within seven days. (To know more details
regarding this curse of the sage see under Āstīka). The
worried King in consultation with his ministers decided
to take protective measures. At first he moved to a
seven-storeyed palace and stayed on the seventh storey.
Physicians of fame and those well-versed in mantras
were posted at the palace. Brahmins were put on duty
for prayers. The entire palace and precincts were
guarded by huge elephants. Security arrangements
were such that even wind found it impossible to enter
the palace without permission. The King did all his
daily routine activities in the palace itself.
[Page783-a+ 64]
At that time Kaśyapa [There is a version that it was
Dhanvantari who was thus sent back by Takṣaka. 9th
Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata] was the greatest of all
physicians and māntrikas and, greedy that he was, he
started to the palace of Parīkṣit thinking that it would
be the best opportunity to obtain some money from the
King. Takṣaka also was going to the palace in the guise
of a brahmin. On the way Takṣaka met Kaśyapa and
knowing well that the presence of the celebrated
Kaśyapa at the palace would be an obstacle to the
achievement of his mission, he approached Kaśyapa.
They talked on the way and Kaśyapa said he was going
to the palace to save the King from the bite of Takṣaka.
Then Takṣaka, revealing his identity, said that it was
impossible to save anybody from the result of his bite.
Both then decided to test their skill then and there. A
huge banyan tree with many branches spreading wide
was standing nearby and Takṣaka gave it a bite.
Within seconds the huge tree was charred to destruct-
ion; Kaśyapa then took some water and reciting a
mantra poured the water over the ashes of the tree and
then to the surprise of Takṣaka, the tree rose up and
stood in its original form. On seeing that Takṣaka
confessed that Kaśyapa was superior to him. Takṣaka
then coaxed him to his side and giving him a huge
amount as bribe bade him return home.
<div n="NI"/>Six days went by and on the seventh day Takṣaka
reached the palace of Parīkṣit. He found the palace
well-guarded and watched. There was no way to go in.
Takṣaka then called all his relatives and had them
disguised as brahmins. He sent them in with fruits and
roots, like people who had come to pay homage to the
King. Takṣaka crept into one of the most attractive of
the fruits as a tiny worm. The guards at the gate stop-
ped them. The fake brahmins then said that they had
come a long way from a far off tapovana and should be
allowed to see the King. The information was carried
to the King. The King said he would see the brahmins
the next day but ordered their gifts to be brought to
him. When the fruits and roots were brought to him,
he gave a fruit each to the ministers, himself taking
the most beautiful fruit of the lot. When he cut the
fruit open he saw a worm with two black eyes and a
red body sitting inside it and was a bit surprised. Then
he addressed his ministers thus: “Oh, best of ministers,
by your earnest and sincere endeavour nothing has
happened to me till now. The Sun is going to set and
the term of the curse is going to end. There is no need
to be afraid of any poison now. But let not a curse of
a sage go futile. Let this worm bite me and fulfill the
curse.” So saying the King took the worm and placed
it on his neck. The worm changed itself into the fierce
Takṣaka and bit the King and the King fell down
dead. (12th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Takṣaka became Indra's friend.%} Once the son of
a sage of great divine splendour named Uttaṅka was
studying under a Guru named Veda. When his edu-
cation was complete, the Guru asked him to bring
as dakṣiṇā (fees) the ear-rings worn by the Kṣatriya
wife of King Pauṣya. Indra made Takṣaka steal the
ornament and created many obstacles on the way.
(For details see under Uttaṅka). That incident made
them mutual friends and gradually Takṣaka became an
intimate friend of Indra.
[Page783-b+ 64]
From that day onwards Uttaṅka waited for an oppor-
tunity to take vengeance on Takṣaka. It was at that
time that Janamejaya, son of Parīkṣit, became the king.
Janamejaya was only eleven years old when he became
king and he was not then aware of the details of the
death of his father. Uttaṅka went to him and told
him how Takṣaka killed his father. Janamejaya became
furious and asked him how to wreak vengeance on him.
Uttaṅka suggested the performance of a Sarpasatra to
which all the serpents should be attracted by mantras
and burnt to death there. The young king agreed and
Uttaṅka with other ṛṣis commenced the Sarpasatra.
<div n="NI"/>One by one all the serpents came and fell into the sacri-
ficial fire but Takṣaka was not to be found. Where is
Takṣaka? This question was heard from many lips.
Takṣaka was specially invoked by Uttaṅka. Takṣaka
could not bear the power of Uttaṅka and he ran and
prostrated before Indra. Indra not only did give refuge
but gave him half of his seat in the throne and Takṣaka
sat on it fully confident of security. Uttaṅka was
enraged, when after repeated calls by mantra, Takṣaka
did not appear and so he sat in meditation for some
time to know the cause. He then saw Takṣaka sitting
on the throne of Indra and the sight threw him into
fury and he invoked Takṣaka, Indra and the throne
and all. Lo! in an instant Indra, Takṣaka, the throne
and all started moving towards the sacrificial fire!
Within seconds all would have been burnt to death
but for the timely intervention of a brahmin boy named
Āstīka, son of the sage Jaratkāru. (See under Āstīka,
Takṣaka escaped death that time).
<div n="NI"/>Takṣaka by instructions from Indra was living in the
forest of Khāṇḍava and when that was burnt by Agni,
it was Indra who saved Takṣaka from the fire. (See
under Khāṇḍavadāha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) A king called Candrāṅgada lived in the house of
Takṣaka for some time. (See under Candrāṅgada).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Takṣaka in the guise of a brahmin named Kṣapa-
ṇaka went to the sage Uttaṅka and stole the ornaments
from him. (See under Uttaṅka).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once the Earth was made into a cow and every-
body milked from her what each wanted. The serpents
milked poison from her and they then used Takṣaka as
the calf. (See under Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) During the burning of the forest of Khāṇḍava,
Arjuna slew the wife of Takṣaka. (See under Khāṇḍa-
vadāha).
<div n="NI"/>(v) When the soul of Balabhadrarāma, after his death,
reached Pātāla, Takṣaka received it with respect. (Śloka
15, Chapter 4, Mausala Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Takṣaka lives in the court of Varuṇa worshipping
him. (Śloka 8, Chapter 9, Sabhā Parva).
