TAKṢAKA I¦. A fierce serpent.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descending in order from
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu—Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Takṣaka.
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapamuni got of his wife Kadrū serpents and
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka was one of the serpent chiefs. (Śloka 5, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 35, Ādi Parva). See also under Kadrū).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Takṣaka and Parīkṣit.%} In his boyhood Takṣaka went
<div n="lb"/>out from the family. The reason was a curse by his
<div n="lb"/>mother. Once Kadrū and Vinatā, another wife of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, entered into a controversy regarding the
<div n="lb"/>colour of the hair of the tail of the horse Uccaiśśravas.
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū said, it was black and Vinatā said it was white.
<div n="lb"/>It was decided that she who lost the wager should
<div n="lb"/>become the servant of the other. That night Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>called her children and asked them to go and hang on
<div n="lb"/>the tail of the horse so that it should appear black.
<div n="lb"/>Some of the righteous children opposed this deceitful
<div n="lb"/>attempt of their mother and refused to go. Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>cursed them saying that they would be burnt to death
<div n="lb"/>at the Sarpasatra of Janamejaya. Kadrū sent those
<div n="lb"/>children out from home and Takṣaka became their
<div n="lb"/>leader.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Parīkṣit (King of Bhārata) became the
<div n="lb"/>victim of a curse that he would die by the bite of
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka within seven days. (To know more details
<div n="lb"/>regarding this curse of the sage see under Āstīka). The
<div n="lb"/>worried King in consultation with his ministers decided
<div n="lb"/>to take protective measures. At first he moved to a
<div n="lb"/>seven-storeyed palace and stayed on the seventh storey.
<div n="lb"/>Physicians of fame and those well-versed in mantras
<div n="lb"/>were posted at the palace. Brahmins were put on duty
<div n="lb"/>for prayers. The entire palace and precincts were
<div n="lb"/>guarded by huge elephants. Security arrangements
<div n="lb"/>were such that even wind found it impossible to enter
<div n="lb"/>the palace without permission. The King did all his
<div n="lb"/>daily routine activities in the palace itself.
[Page783-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>At that time Kaśyapa [There is a version that it was
<div n="lb"/>Dhanvantari who was thus sent back by Takṣaka. 9th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata] was the greatest of all
<div n="lb"/>physicians and māntrikas and, greedy that he was, he
<div n="lb"/>started to the palace of Parīkṣit thinking that it would
<div n="lb"/>be the best opportunity to obtain some money from the
<div n="lb"/>King. Takṣaka also was going to the palace in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of a brahmin. On the way Takṣaka met Kaśyapa and
<div n="lb"/>knowing well that the presence of the celebrated
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa at the palace would be an obstacle to the
<div n="lb"/>achievement of his mission, he approached Kaśyapa.
<div n="lb"/>They talked on the way and Kaśyapa said he was going
<div n="lb"/>to the palace to save the King from the bite of Takṣaka.
<div n="lb"/>Then Takṣaka, revealing his identity, said that it was
<div n="lb"/>impossible to save anybody from the result of his bite.
<div n="lb"/>Both then decided to test their skill then and there. A
<div n="lb"/>huge banyan tree with many branches spreading wide
<div n="lb"/>was standing nearby and Takṣaka gave it a bite.
<div n="lb"/>Within seconds the huge tree was charred to destruct-
<div n="lb"/>ion; Kaśyapa then took some water and reciting a
<div n="lb"/>mantra poured the water over the ashes of the tree and
<div n="lb"/>then to the surprise of Takṣaka, the tree rose up and
<div n="lb"/>stood in its original form. On seeing that Takṣaka
<div n="lb"/>confessed that Kaśyapa was superior to him. Takṣaka
<div n="lb"/>then coaxed him to his side and giving him a huge
<div n="lb"/>amount as bribe bade him return home.
<div n="NI"/>Six days went by and on the seventh day Takṣaka
<div n="lb"/>reached the palace of Parīkṣit. He found the palace
<div n="lb"/>well-guarded and watched. There was no way to go in.
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka then called all his relatives and had them
<div n="lb"/>disguised as brahmins. He sent them in with fruits and
<div n="lb"/>roots, like people who had come to pay homage to the
<div n="lb"/>King. Takṣaka crept into one of the most attractive of
<div n="lb"/>the fruits as a tiny worm. The guards at the gate stop-
<div n="lb"/>ped them. The fake brahmins then said that they had
<div n="lb"/>come a long way from a far off tapovana and should be
<div n="lb"/>allowed to see the King. The information was carried
<div n="lb"/>to the King. The King said he would see the brahmins
<div n="lb"/>the next day but ordered their gifts to be brought to
<div n="lb"/>him. When the fruits and roots were brought to him,
<div n="lb"/>he gave a fruit each to the ministers, himself taking
<div n="lb"/>the most beautiful fruit of the lot. When he cut the
<div n="lb"/>fruit open he saw a worm with two black eyes and a
<div n="lb"/>red body sitting inside it and was a bit surprised. Then
<div n="lb"/>he addressed his ministers thus: “Oh, best of ministers,
<div n="lb"/>by your earnest and sincere endeavour nothing has
<div n="lb"/>happened to me till now. The Sun is going to set and
<div n="lb"/>the term of the curse is going to end. There is no need
<div n="lb"/>to be afraid of any poison now. But let not a curse of
<div n="lb"/>a sage go futile. Let this worm bite me and fulfill the
<div n="lb"/>curse.” So saying the King took the worm and placed
<div n="lb"/>it on his neck. The worm changed itself into the fierce
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka and bit the King and the King fell down
<div n="lb"/>dead. (12th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Takṣaka became Indra's friend.%} Once the son of
<div n="lb"/>a sage of great divine splendour named Uttaṅka was
<div n="lb"/>studying under a Guru named Veda. When his edu-
<div n="lb"/>cation was complete, the Guru asked him to bring
<div n="lb"/>as dakṣiṇā (fees) the ear-rings worn by the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>wife of King Pauṣya. Indra made Takṣaka steal the
<div n="lb"/>ornament and created many obstacles on the way.
<div n="lb"/>(For details see under Uttaṅka). That incident made
<div n="lb"/>them mutual friends and gradually Takṣaka became an
<div n="lb"/>intimate friend of Indra.
[Page783-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards Uttaṅka waited for an oppor-
<div n="lb"/>tunity to take vengeance on Takṣaka. It was at that
<div n="lb"/>time that Janamejaya, son of Parīkṣit, became the king.
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya was only eleven years old when he became
<div n="lb"/>king and he was not then aware of the details of the
<div n="lb"/>death of his father. Uttaṅka went to him and told
<div n="lb"/>him how Takṣaka killed his father. Janamejaya became
<div n="lb"/>furious and asked him how to wreak vengeance on him.
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka suggested the performance of a Sarpasatra to
<div n="lb"/>which all the serpents should be attracted by mantras
<div n="lb"/>and burnt to death there. The young king agreed and
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka with other ṛṣis commenced the Sarpasatra.
<div n="NI"/>One by one all the serpents came and fell into the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficial fire but Takṣaka was not to be found. Where is
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka? This question was heard from many lips.
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka was specially invoked by Uttaṅka. Takṣaka
<div n="lb"/>could not bear the power of Uttaṅka and he ran and
<div n="lb"/>prostrated before Indra. Indra not only did give refuge
<div n="lb"/>but gave him half of his seat in the throne and Takṣaka
<div n="lb"/>sat on it fully confident of security. Uttaṅka was
<div n="lb"/>enraged, when after repeated calls by mantra, Takṣaka
<div n="lb"/>did not appear and so he sat in meditation for some
<div n="lb"/>time to know the cause. He then saw Takṣaka sitting
<div n="lb"/>on the throne of Indra and the sight threw him into
<div n="lb"/>fury and he invoked Takṣaka, Indra and the throne
<div n="lb"/>and all. Lo! in an instant Indra, Takṣaka, the throne
<div n="lb"/>and all started moving towards the sacrificial fire!
<div n="lb"/>Within seconds all would have been burnt to death
<div n="lb"/>but for the timely intervention of a brahmin boy named
<div n="lb"/>Āstīka, son of the sage Jaratkāru. (See under Āstīka,
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka escaped death that time).
<div n="NI"/>Takṣaka by instructions from Indra was living in the
<div n="lb"/>forest of Khāṇḍava and when that was burnt by Agni,
<div n="lb"/>it was Indra who saved Takṣaka from the fire. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Khāṇḍavadāha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) A king called Candrāṅgada lived in the house of
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka for some time. (See under Candrāṅgada).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Takṣaka in the guise of a brahmin named Kṣapa-
<div n="lb"/>ṇaka went to the sage Uttaṅka and stole the ornaments
<div n="lb"/>from him. (See under Uttaṅka).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once the Earth was made into a cow and every-
<div n="lb"/>body milked from her what each wanted. The serpents
<div n="lb"/>milked poison from her and they then used Takṣaka as
<div n="lb"/>the calf. (See under Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) During the burning of the forest of Khāṇḍava,
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna slew the wife of Takṣaka. (See under Khāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vadāha).
<div n="NI"/>(v) When the soul of Balabhadrarāma, after his death,
<div n="lb"/>reached Pātāla, Takṣaka received it with respect. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>15, Chapter 4, Mausala Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Takṣaka lives in the court of Varuṇa worshipping
<div n="lb"/>him. (Śloka 8, Chapter 9, Sabhā Parva).
