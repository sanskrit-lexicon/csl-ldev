NĀRĪTĪRTHA¦. Common name for the five tīrthas, i.e.
Agastya tīrtha, Saubhadratīrtha, Paulomatīrtha, Kāran-
dhamatīrtha and Bharadvājatīrtha. Once Arjuna bathed
in Bharadvājatīrtha. The Apsarā women called Vargās
were living in the five tīrthas in the form of crocodiles as
the result of a curse. With the arrival of Arjuna there, the
crocodiles resumed their previous forms as Apsarā wo-
men and returned to Devaloka. (For the curse etc. see
under Vargā).
