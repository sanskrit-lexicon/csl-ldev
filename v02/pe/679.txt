ĀḌI¦. A mighty son of the demon, Andhakāsura. He did
penance to please Brahmā and obtained from him a
boon to seek vengeance on Śiva who had murdered his
father. The boon was that Āḍi would die only when he
left his present form and took another form. After
obtaining the boon Āḍi went to Kailāsa and outwitting
the sentries entered the abode of Śiva in the shape of a
serpent. After that he disguised himself as Pārvatī and
went near Śiva. But Śiva knew the trick and killed him.
(Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa).
