BHARTṚSTHĀNA¦(M). A very holy place in ancient
<div n="lb"/>India. It is said that even those who merely visited this
<div n="lb"/>place would get the benefit of performing an Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>yajña. The place got its importance because Lord
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya lived there. (Śloka 76, Chapter 84, Vana
