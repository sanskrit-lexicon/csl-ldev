<div n="lb"/>dvīpa, Plakṣadvīpa, Śālmalidvīpa, Kuśadvīpa,
<div n="lb"/>Krauñcadvīpa, Śākadvīpa and Puṣkaradvīpa. Each of
<div n="lb"/>these islands is surrounded by sea. The sea that surrounds
<div n="lb"/>Jambūdvīpa is the Lavaṇa sea (salt sea), the Plakṣa
<div n="lb"/>dvīpa is surrounded by the sea of Sugarcane-juice,
<div n="lb"/>Śāmalidvīpa by the sea of liquor, Kuśadvīpa by the sea

<div n="lb"/>by the sea of milk and the Puṣkaradvīpa by the sea of
<div n="lb"/>pure water. In the centre of all, lies the Jambūdvīpa
<div n="lb"/>and in the centre of this island, stands the golden
<div n="lb"/>mountain meru. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} There is a story about the origin of these
<div n="lb"/>seven islands and the surrounding seas, in Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata Skandha 8.
<div n="NI"/>Two famous sons named Priyavrata and Uttānapāda
<div n="lb"/>were born to Svāyambhuva Manu. Priyavrata and his
<div n="lb"/>children ruled the country for a period of eleven arbu-
<div n="lb"/>das, that is a hundred million years. Though he was
<div n="lb"/>aged so much the power of his mind and body did
[Page691-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>not show any sign of weakness. At this time he saw once
<div n="lb"/>the sun travelling on the first side of the earth, and
<div n="lb"/>began to think. “When the sun is walking on one
<div n="lb"/>side of the earth, the other side must naturally be dark.
<div n="lb"/>Will it happen so in our time? In all places at all
<div n="lb"/>times it should be bright and there should be no dark-
<div n="lb"/>ness.” Thinking thus he got into a chariot as bright as
<div n="lb"/>the sun and travelled round the earth seven times.
<div n="lb"/>During these travels the wheels of the chariot made
<div n="lb"/>seven furrows on the earth. These furrows became the
<div n="lb"/>seven seas and the beds between the furrows became
<div n="lb"/>seven islands.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sovereign powers.%} Priyavrata made his seven sons
<div n="lb"/>sovereigns of the seven islands. These seven sovereign
<div n="lb"/>rulers were Agnīdhra, Idhmajihva, Yajñabāhu,
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyaretas, Ghṛtapṛṣṭha, Medhātithi and Vītihotra.
