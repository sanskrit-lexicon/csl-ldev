SAṂGHAM¦ (SAṄGHAM). An organisation formed in
<div n="lb"/>olden days for the cultivation of Śentamil (classic
<div n="lb"/>Tamil) literature, which took its origin in south
<div n="lb"/>Drāviḍa land in the 4th century B.C. The Pāṇḍyas set
<div n="lb"/>up three Saṅghams for the promotion of this literature,
<div n="lb"/>the first one in southern Madura. When the city was
<div n="lb"/>swept by erosion of the sea they set up the second
<div n="lb"/>Saṅgham at Kapāṭapura. When Kapāṭapura also was
<div n="lb"/>destroyed by the sea, the third Saṅgham was founded
<div n="lb"/>in Drāviḍa Madura. The first Saṅgham was called
<div n="lb"/>Mutarcaṅkam, the second Iṭaiccaṅkam and the third
<div n="lb"/>one Kaṭaiccaṅkam. Reliable information about the
<div n="lb"/>first two Saṅghams is not available. But, there are
<div n="lb"/>reasons to believe that a Saṅgham called Kataiccaṅkam
<div n="lb"/>flourished for about six hundred years from 2nd
<div n="lb"/>century B.C. to the close of the 4th century A.D.
<div n="lb"/>(History of Kerala Literature by Ullūr, Part 1, Page
<div n="lb"/>47).
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍyan King had built at Madura a hall
<div n="lb"/>(maṇḍapa) for the poets and scholars of the third
<div n="lb"/>Saṅgham to assemble together to produce their works.
<div n="lb"/>Even to this day there exists a temple called
<div n="lb"/>Saṅghattārkovil at the south-western corner of the
<div n="lb"/>outer sector of the Sundareśvara temple. There the
<div n="lb"/>idols of Sarasvatī and of the fortynine poets of the
<div n="lb"/>Saṅgham are being worshipped even today. The growth
<div n="lb"/>and influence of the Buddhist and the Jain religions
<div n="lb"/>and also that of the Pallava royal dynasty, contributed
<div n="lb"/>to the downfall of the Saṅgham. The Saṅgham poets
<div n="lb"/>have written many excellent books. According to
<div n="lb"/>legends, Agastyam is a text on grammar of the first
<div n="lb"/>Saṅgham and Tolkāpyam of the second Saṅgham.
<div n="lb"/>There were authoritative text books on music written by
<div n="lb"/>the last poets of the Saṅgham. But, none of these books
<div n="lb"/>has been unearthed yet. Again, references are found
<div n="lb"/>to dramas like Muruval, Jayantam, etc. They too
<div n="lb"/>have not yet been found out. Five mahākāvyas (Epic
<div n="lb"/>poems) and five short Kāvyas also belong to Saṅgham
<div n="lb"/>works. Puranānūru. Akanānūru, Patiṭṭuppattu, Aiṃ
<div n="lb"/>kurunūru, Kalittokai, Kuruntokai, Paripāṭal and
<div n="lb"/>Naṭṭiṇai are included in the Saṅgham work called
<div n="lb"/>Eṭṭuttokai. Most of them are collections of many com-
<div n="lb"/>positions. The authorship of the four hundred songs in
<div n="lb"/>Puranānūru is distributed among nearly 160 poets.
<div n="lb"/>Aiṃ Kurunūru contains five hundred songs by five
<div n="lb"/>poets. These five hundred songs were collected by the
<div n="lb"/>scholar, Kūṭalūr kizhār, on the orders of the Cera
<div n="lb"/>King, Ceraliruṃpozhai. Patiṭṭippattu is a collection
<div n="lb"/>of songs composed by ten poets in praise of the Cera
<div n="lb"/>Kings. But, only eight of these from two to nine are
<div n="lb"/>available yet. Pattuppāṭṭu comprised of the follow-
[Page679-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>ing works like Tirumurukāttuppaṭai, etc. Tirukkural,
<div n="lb"/>Nālaṭiyar etc. are among the eighteen works under
<div n="lb"/>the group Patineṇkīzhkkaṇakku. Cilappadikāram,
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimekhalai, Jīvakacintāmaṇi, Kuṇḍalakeśī and
<div n="lb"/>Valaiyāpati are the five great kāvyas and Nīlakeśi,
<div n="lb"/>Cūḍāmaṇi, Yaśodākāvyam, Nāgakumāra-Kāvyam and
<div n="lb"/>Udayakumārakāvyam (Udayaṇankatai) are the five
<div n="lb"/>short (laghu) kāvyas. Amongst the above kāvyas
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimekhalai and Kuṇḍalakeśi are Buddhist kāvyas
<div n="lb"/>and Cintāmaṇi and the five short kāvyas are Jain
<div n="lb"/>works. The last seven books might have been written
<div n="lb"/>after the Saṅgham period. Tiruttakkatevar, author of
<div n="lb"/>Cintāmaṇi, lived in eighth century A.D. Some of the
<div n="lb"/>songs in Puranānūru are the oldest among the works of
<div n="lb"/>the Saṅgham period. References to Cera Kings are
<div n="lb"/>found in many of these works.
