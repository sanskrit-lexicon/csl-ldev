DADHYAṄ¦.
<F>1) The stories regarding the two hermits Dadhici and Dadhyaṅ in the Purāṇas are not very clear. In Mahā bhārata Dadhīca is men-
tioned as the son of Bhṛgu, and in Ṛgveda it occurs that Dadhīca was the son of Hermit Atharva who was the son of Vasiṣṭha.
Moreover the story of Dadhyaṅ teaching the Aśvinīdevas the ‘Madhuvidyā’ is connected with Dadhici in some other purānas
Some statements in the Ṛgveda make it difficult to assume that both Dadhyaṅ and Dadhīci are one and the same person. So relying
on the majority of statements in the various purāṇas this book has accepted the fact that these hermits are separate persons and that
Dadhīci was the son of Bhṛgu whereas the hermit who taught Madhuvidyā to the Aśvinīdevas was Dadhyaṅ.</F> A hermit. Once Indra taught this
hermit Madhuvidyā (the art of mead) Indra told the
hermit that his head would be cut off if he taught any-
body this art. The Aśvinīdevas approached Dadhyaṅ
to learn this art. Fearing Indra the hermit refused to
teach them the art. Aśvinīdevas cut off his head and
buried it in a place. Then they cut off the head of a
horse and fixed it on the neck of Dadhyaṅ. Having
the head of the horse he taught the art to the Aśvinī-
devas. When Dadhyaṅ had finished teaching, they
took away the head of the horse and fixed his own
head in place. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka, 17,
Sūkta 166).
