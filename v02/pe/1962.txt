DHARMAVARṆA¦. A Brahmin who lived in the country
of Ānarta at the end of Kaliyuga. Once when he went
to the land of the dead, he saw his fathers hanging by
the end of darbha. They requested Dharmavarṇa to
marry and obtain sons who would get them relief from
their plight. Dharmavarṇa married and as soon as he
got a son he went to the forest of Gandhamādana to
practise penance there. (Chapters 2, 17 and 22, Skanda
Purāṇa).
