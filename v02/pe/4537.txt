<div n="NI"/>2) {%The-wealth of Mithilā.%} Mithilā was the capital of the

<div n="lb"/>be smeared. In the middle of Tretāyuga Videha was
<div n="lb"/>ruled by a Janaka who brought fame and prosperity to

<div n="lb"/>Nit abrahmacāriṇī.
<div n="NI"/>Videha grew prosperous with agricultural wealth by
<div n="lb"/>hard work put up by the peasants and divine wealth

<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
