SĀVITRĪ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The daughter of the Sun. This
Sāvitrī is the elder sister of Tapatī. Brahmā married
these sisters. It is stated in some Purāṇas that Sāvitrī,
Gāyatrī, Sarasvatī all these are one and the same. But
there is a story in Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa, Chapter
17, stating that Brahmā once went to Gāyatrī in the
absence of Sāvitrī, who got angry at this and cursed all
the Gods.
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā went to Puṣkara to perform a sacrifice.
Śiva, Viṣṇu and all the hermits came there. Everything
was ready for the sacrifice according to convention.
But Sāvitrī, who had been engaged in household duties
had not yet arrived. So a priest was sent to bring her.
Sāvitrī said to the priest, “I have not finished dressing.
There are so many things to be done here. Moreover,
Lakṣmī, Bhavānī, Gaṅgā, Svāhā, Indrāṇī, celestial
women, wives of Ṛṣis (hermits), none of these have
arrived yet. How can I enter the hall as the only
woman?” The priest returned and reported that it
was not convenient for Sāvitrī to come just then, as she
had so much work to do. Brahmā became angry and
said to Indra. “Lord Indra, it is up to you to bring
me a wife from wherever you like. But it must be
done instantly.” Hearing the order of Brahmā, Indra
selected Gāyatrī who was a good-natured damsel of a
cowherd's family, and brought her to the sacrificial
dais. With the blessings of the hermits and gods, Brahmā
held her hand and acknowledged her as his wife.
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī dressed well, adorned herself with ornaments and
reached the sacrificial hall. She saw the marriage scene
and became furious. Everybody in the hall held their
breath, thinking of the approaching danger. Trembling
with anger Sāvitrī said “Lo; Brahmā, how is it that you
have committed this sin? Have you not married me with
[Page712-b+ 65]
fire as witness? I am your wife. Are you not ashamed
of this?” The three godheads shivered with fear. Sāvitrī
cursed everybody. The curse given to Brahmā was that
no body should worship him on any other day except
the month of Kārttika in the year. She cursed Indra
that enemies would enter the world of gods and would
make Indra their captive. Sāvitrī cried out that Viṣṇu
would take the birth of man by the curse of Bhṛgu. She
cursed Śiva that he would lose his manliness. She gave
Agni the curse that he would eat anything and every-
thing without the discrimination of purity or impurity.
She cursed the Brahmins that they would, in future per-
form sacrifice merely with a view to obtain gifts and
that they would be wandering about from temple to
temple and from tīrtha to tīrtha merely for gain.”
<div n="NI"/>Uttering these words of curse, Sāvitrī left the sacrificial
hall. Lakṣmī and some other goddesses followed her a
little while. Then they begged for permission to return.
Sāvitrī said to them, “Lakṣmī! You are leaving me. Is it
not so? Right. Hereafter you shall be permanent no-
where. May you become the companion of the wicked,
the wavering, the low-minded, the sinner, the cruel, the
foolish etc. Indrāṇī also wants to return. Hear this:
Indra will kill Vṛtra and incur the sin of Brahmahatyā
and at that time Nahuṣa will capture heaven. Then
Nahuṣa will abuse you.”
<div n="NI"/>Looking at the celestial women who were going to the
sacrificial hall, Sāvitrī said; Look, Ye celestial women.
None of you will give birth to child and you will
not enjoy the pleasure of nurturing a child.” Saying
these words Sāvitrī left the hall. Not knowing what to
do, all sat there. Instantly Gāyatrī rose up and looking
at everybody, said as a remission of curses: “I shall remit
all curses. Those who worship Brahmā, will be blessed
with the pleasure of wife and children and wealth and
they will unite with Brahmā. Even if Indra is taken
captive, he will be made free by his son and will become
the king of heaven again. Viṣṇu will rescue his wife and
kill the enemy. The phallus will be worshipped in all
the worlds. As Brahmins are the gods on earth the gift
you take, will be considered your dues. Lakṣmī! you
need not worry. Everybody will worship you. He whom
you favour will become a well-to-do person and he whom
you forsake will become miserable. You Indrāṇī! Because
of Nahuṣa's arrogance Agastya will change him to a big
python and he will fall to the earth. The celestial maids
will have no desire for children. So childlessness will
not make you miserable.” By these words of blessings
of Gāyatrī, everybody in the sacrificial hall was paci-
fied.
