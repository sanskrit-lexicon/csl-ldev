CANDRĀṄGADA¦. Grandson of Nala. He married
<div n="lb"/>Sīmantinī, daughter of Citravarman, a king of Āryāvarta.
<div n="lb"/>Sīmantinī, hearing about Candrāṅgada fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with him, and it was with the help of Maitreyī, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya, that she was wedded to him.
<div n="NI"/>While once Candrāṅgada was enjoying a boat-race in
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī (river) with his friends a storm upset the boat
<div n="lb"/>and most of them were drowned to death. The servants
<div n="lb"/>of Takṣaka saw Candrāṅgada sinking to the bottom
<div n="lb"/>of the river and carried him to Pātāla and he stayed
<div n="lb"/>there for sometime in the midst of amorous nāga damsels.
<div n="lb"/>Candrāṅgada's people, under the impression that he
<div n="lb"/>had died, performed his funeral rites, and Sīmantinī
[Page174-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>took to widow's life. Enemies captured his kingdom
<div n="lb"/>and imprisoned his father, Indrasena. When once the
<div n="lb"/>nāga King asked Candrāṅgada to marry nāga girls and
<div n="lb"/>settle down in Pātāla he told the King that he was already
<div n="lb"/>married and that his wife Sīmantinī was brooding over
<div n="lb"/>him, and he had, therefore, to return to her. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>the nāga king sent him back with presents of a white
<div n="lb"/>horse, a Rākṣasa and an infant serpent.
<div n="NI"/>Candrāṅgada, with his presents, came up in Kālindī
<div n="lb"/>where Sīmantinī, grief-stricken was spending her days
<div n="lb"/>in penance, and they recognised each other. Informed
<div n="lb"/>about the return of Candrāṅgada the enemy kings releas-
<div n="lb"/>ed his father from captivity and apologised to him.
<div n="lb"/>And he pardoned them.
<div n="NI"/>Candrāṅgada and Sīmantinī took great interest in observ-
<div n="lb"/>ing somavāravrata (fasting etc. on Mondays) and pleased
<div n="lb"/>at the vrata of the latter Śrī Pārvatī blessed her. Two
<div n="lb"/>brahmins called Devamitra and Sārasvata were living
<div n="lb"/>there at the time. Three sons called Sumedha, Sārasvata
<div n="lb"/>and Sāmavān were born to Devamitra. The sons also
<div n="lb"/>turned out to be great scholars but they were poor.
<div n="lb"/>They could not get brides as they were poor. In the
<div n="lb"/>hope that they would get some money if they approached
<div n="lb"/>Candrāṅgada and Sīmantinī the brahmins went to
<div n="lb"/>them. After hearing their story the king and his queen
<div n="lb"/>conducted them in a procession in the precincts of the
<div n="lb"/>palace, Sumedha dressed as husband and Sāmavān
<div n="lb"/>as his wife. But, lo! when the procession was over
<div n="lb"/>Sāmavān could not be divested of his womanhood, and
<div n="lb"/>Sīmantinī named her Sāmavatī. Being told that his
<div n="lb"/>son had turned woman Sārasvata sought the advice of
<div n="lb"/>some munis to remedy the situation. But, all the attempts
<div n="lb"/>of the munis to change the woman to man failed, and
<div n="lb"/>they opined that only Pārvatī, who had been pleased
<div n="lb"/>by the Somavāravrata, would be able to find a solution
<div n="lb"/>to the problem. From that day onwards the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>youths lived as husband and wife. (Śiva Purāṇa, Soma-
<div n="lb"/>vāravratam).
