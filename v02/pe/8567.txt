VITASTĀ¦. A river famous in the Purāṇas. Mention is
<div n="lb"/>made about this river in Ṛgveda. Important rivers
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Ṛgveda are, Kubhā, Sindhu, Suvāstu
<div n="lb"/>Vitastā, Asiknī, Paruṣṇī, Śatadrū, Sarasvatī and
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā. These rivers were more important than the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges in those days. Mention is made about the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges only once in Ṛgveda. Perhaps the Āryans were
<div n="lb"/>not acquainted with the Gangetic basin in those days.
<div n="lb"/>The region from the rivers Kubhā to Yamunā was
<div n="lb"/>Āryadeśa (the country of the Āryans). The information
<div n="lb"/>about this river Vitastā given in Mahābhārata is given
<div n="lb"/>below:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) The river Vitastā is the same river as Jhelum in
<div n="lb"/>Kashmir. The deity (goddess) of this river stays in the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Varuṇa and praises him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 9, Stanza 19).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) By worshipping the Devatās and the Manes after
<div n="lb"/>taking bath in this river, one could obtain the fruits of
<div n="lb"/>performing the sacrifice Vājapeya. In Kashmir, Takṣaka
<div n="lb"/>the King of the Nāgas has a famous palace known as
<div n="lb"/>Vitasta. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Stanza 39).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once four hundred horses with black ears, owned
<div n="lb"/>by Brahmins were caught in the current of this river
<div n="lb"/>and carried away. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 119,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) If anybody bathes in the waves of the river Vita-
<div n="lb"/>stā, with vow and fasts, for seven days he would become
<div n="lb"/>as pure as a hermit. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>25, Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Once Pārvatī made a speech before Śiva on the
<div n="lb"/>duties of women, after receiving advice from rivers.
<div n="lb"/>The river Vitastā was one of the rivers which advised
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 146, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>18).
