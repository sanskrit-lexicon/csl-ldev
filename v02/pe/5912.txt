SAHASRAMUKHARĀVAṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Daitya King, who ruled Trilokapurī, a
country thousands of miles away from India. Triloka-
purī was an island at the centre of the seas. He was a
terror to the whole world and possessed a thousand
heads and two thousand hands.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Secured boon.%} This Rāvaṇa once went to Satyaloka
and performed the most intense tapas for many years.
Yet, Brahmā did not appear and then he began cutting
his heads one after the other and offering them in the
fire. Nine hundred and ninetynine of his heads were
cut thus. When he was about to cut the last head also,
Brahmā, fearing the end of the world, appeared and
granted him the following three boons.
<div n="NI"/>(i) You will not die at the hands of anyone, but
a woman.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Brahmāstra, which would annihilate, will be at
your disposal.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) You will also possess an aerial chariot for travels
as you please.
[Page665-b+ 64]
Sahasramukha, who returned to his country with the
boons became emperor of all Daityas and then con-
quered heaven, Pātāla, Kailāsa, Vaikuṇṭha and the
eight regions of the world.
<div n="NI"/>He then defeated Pātālarāvaṇa and wedded his only
daughter Indumukhī. He got as a present a weapon
called Kaṭhorakuṭhāra. He propagated in the world
the customs and practices of heaven with the result
that all the customs of the Devas were derogated. Good
people felt harassed. In the rise of unrighteousness
righteousness became helpless.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Curse.%} Once on his way to his father-in-law's
house Sahasramukharāvaṇa raped a Vidyādhara
woman, Cañcalākṣī, who was performing tapas of
Lakṣmīdevī and Cañcalākṣī cursed him that Lakṣmī-
devī would kill him.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Son.%} Vajrabāhu was Sahasramukha's son. He
secured from Śiva Pāśupatāstra and an armour im-
penetrable by anyone. Vajrabāhu captured Indra and
Subrahmaṇya killed the former.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death.%} Sahasramukha had an army-chief named
Bāṇa and both of them together did incalculable harm
to the three worlds. Śrī Rāma was King of Ayodhyā
at the time, and Devas and sages complained to him
about Sahasramukha and as soon as the complainants
left Ayodhyā, Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa came there. They
told Rāma about the abduction by Sahasramukha's
second son, Candragupta of Sugrīva's daughter and
Vibhīṣaṇa's daughter-in-law. At once Śrī Rāma,
along with Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, Vibhīṣaṇa, Hanūmān
and a great army of monkeys reached Sahasramukha's
capital city. Śrī Rāma sent word to him through
Hanūmān that Sugrīva's daughter and Vibhīṣaṇa's
daughter-in-law should be returned, Indra should be
released and that pardon should be begged for, for
his errors. Angered at this message Sahasramukha
deputed Bāṇa to fight Śrī Rāma. Bāṇa was killed in
battle. (See under Bāṇa IV). Then ensued a fierce
battle between Rāma and Sahasramukha, the latter
aided by Candragupta. Aṅgada was about to be
overpowered by Candragupta, and then the following
celestial voice was heard: “Candragupta will not die
as long as his wife Padmāvatī is reciting Brahmamantra
imparted by Brahmā.” Then Vibhīṣaṇa sent Hanūmān
to the women's quarters and as a result of the latter
using a ‘Kūṭatantrayantra’ great confusion and
quarrels broke out among the women-folk, and
utilising the opportunity Aṅgada killed Candragupta.
<div n="NI"/>Sahasramukha fought Śrī Rāma single-handed. All
tactics of Rāma proved to be of no use. Then he
remembered Brahmā's boon to Sahasramukha and
Cañcalākṣī's curse upon him. Immediately Śrī Rāma
brought down Sītā from Ayodhyā and the latter shot
the Śaktika arrow at the throat of Sahasramukha and
he was killed. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Uttarakāṇḍa),
