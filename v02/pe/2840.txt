JAMADAGNI¦. A hermit of majestic power. He was the
<div n="lb"/>father of Paraśurāma.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order are: Brahmā—Bhṛgu—Cyavana—Aurva—
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka—Jamadagni.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} There is an interesting story about the birth
<div n="lb"/>of Jamadagni. Gādhi was the son of king Kuśāṃba. A
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Satyavatī was born to Gādhi. The
<div n="lb"/>hermit Rcīka giving a dowry of one thousand horses,
<div n="lb"/>each with one black ear, married Satyavatī. Once
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī told her husband that herself and her mother
<div n="lb"/>wanted to get a child each. After the sacrifice of obla-
<div n="lb"/>tions to Agni (fire), Ṛcīka took two parts filled with
<div n="lb"/>boiled rice and gave them to Satyavatī, with mantras
<div n="lb"/>(spells). The radiance of Brahmā was invoked into
<div n="lb"/>one pot and the radiance of Kṣātra was invoked into
<div n="lb"/>the other. The hermit had asked Satyavatī to eat the
<div n="lb"/>rice into which the radiance of Brahmā had been in-
<div n="lb"/>voked and to give the other pot to her mother. But the
<div n="lb"/>daughter and mother changed the pots secretly and
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī ate the rice in the pot into which Kṣātra radi-
<div n="lb"/>ance was invoked and gave the pot of rice filled with
<div n="lb"/>Brāhma-radiance to her mother. Both the women con-
<div n="lb"/>ceived. As the child grew in the womb the radiance of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā shone on the face of the mother and Kṣātra
<div n="lb"/>lustre was seen on the face of Satyavatī, Rcīka asked
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī for the reason. She admitted the secret inter-
<div n="lb"/>change of the pot.
<div n="NI"/>Satyavatī and her mother both delivered at the same
<div n="lb"/>time. Satyavatī got the son Jamadagni, who was the
<div n="lb"/>embodiment of Kṣātra tejas and the child with Brāhma
<div n="lb"/>tejas born to the mother was Viśvāmitra. Therefore, in
<div n="lb"/>some Purāṇas Viśvāmitra is described as the uncle of
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni whereas in some others they are said to be
<div n="lb"/>brothers. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 57).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%A house-holder.%} When Jamadagni grew up he made
<div n="lb"/>a tour and visited the holy places one by one and
<div n="lb"/>reached the palace of King Prasenajit of the family of
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku. He saw Reṇukā the beautiful daughter of
<div n="lb"/>King Prasenajit and fell in love with her. He requested
<div n="lb"/>Prasenajit for the hand of Reṇukā. The King, without
<div n="lb"/>raising any objection gave his daughter Reṇukā in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to Jamadagni. The couple came to the bank
[Page340-a+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>of the river Narmadā and erecting a hermitage began
<div n="lb"/>‘tapas’ (penance). Four sons, Ṛumaṇvān, Suhotra, Vasu
<div n="lb"/>and Viśvāvasu were born to Jamadagni by Reṇukā.
<div n="lb"/>(Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The birth of Paruśu rāma.%} Because of the wickedness
<div n="lb"/>of the Kṣatriya Kings, the goddess Earth became
<div n="lb"/>miserable. She made a representation to Brahmā who
<div n="lb"/>took her to the sea of Milk and told Mahāviṣṇu every-
<div n="lb"/>thing. Mahāviṣṇu promised to take an incarnation as
<div n="lb"/>the son of Jamadagni and destroy all the wicked Kings.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Reṇukā gave birth to Paraśurāma, who
<div n="lb"/>was an incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 59).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Jamadagni getting the bow of Viṣṇu.%} Once the devas
<div n="lb"/>(gods) desired to know who, of Śiva and Viṣṇu was
<div n="lb"/>the more powerful. They informed Brahmā of their
<div n="lb"/>desire. Brahmā asked Viśvakarmā to make two tremen-
<div n="lb"/>dous bows. He gave one to Śiva and the other to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. The bow which Viṣṇu got was known as Vaiṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vacāpa and that which Śiva got was known as
<div n="lb"/>Śaivacāpa. After this Brahmā caused enmity between
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Viṣṇu. A terrible battle ensued between Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and Viṣṇu. After a while the Śaivacāpa became
<div n="lb"/>less effective. At the request of the devas, the fight was
<div n="lb"/>stopped. The devas decided that Viṣṇu was superior to
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, in power. Śiva got angry at this decision and
<div n="lb"/>gave his bow to Devarāta Janaka, the King of Videha.
<div n="lb"/>It was this bow that Śrī Rāma broke at the marriage
<div n="lb"/>of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>Seeing that Śiva had given away his cāpa (bow)
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu gave his bow to his devotee, the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka. That Vaiṣṇava cāpa was given to Jamadagni
<div n="lb"/>by Ṛcīka. Thus the famous Vaiṣṇava cāpa arrived at
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage of Jamadagni. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 75).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Reṇukā was killed.%} Paraśurāma became fourteen
<div n="lb"/>years old. Jamadagni went to the forest to gather
<div n="lb"/>fruits, roots etc. After completing the cleansing work
<div n="lb"/>of the hermitage, leaving Paraśurāma in the forest,
<div n="lb"/>Reṇukā went to the bank of the river Narmadā (Revā)
<div n="lb"/>to fetch water. When she reached the river, Kārta-
<div n="lb"/>vīryārjuna and his wives were playing in water. She
<div n="lb"/>waited for them to go. When they were gone she got
<div n="lb"/>into the river. But as the water was muddy because of
<div n="lb"/>the play, she walked a little to the east where there
<div n="lb"/>was pure water. She saw there Citraratha the King
<div n="lb"/>of Sālva playing with his wife in the water. How
<div n="lb"/>beautiful they were! She had never seen so beautiful a
<div n="lb"/>woman or so handsome a man. She stood there looking
<div n="lb"/>at them for a while. When she reached the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>with water, Jamadagni had already returned a long
<div n="lb"/>while ago. He had returned weary and tired of the
<div n="lb"/>heat of the midday-sun. He did not see his wife in
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage. He had been sitting very angry when
<div n="lb"/>Reṇukā returned with water. She put the pot down
<div n="lb"/>and bowed before her husband and told him the reason
<div n="lb"/>for her being late. When he heard the reason his anger
<div n="lb"/>blazed. He called his sons one by one and ordered
<div n="lb"/>them to kill her. But the four elder sons did not dare
<div n="lb"/>to execute his order saying that slaughter of a woman
<div n="lb"/>was a great sin. But Paraśurāma came forward and
[Page340-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>by a cutting-arrow cut off the head of his mother. The
<div n="lb"/>father called the four sons who disobeyed him and
<div n="lb"/>cursed them thus:
<div n="NI"/>“Since you have disobeyed the order of your father,
<div n="lb"/>because of your ignorance, you shall become foresters
<div n="lb"/>and live in forest.”
<div n="NI"/>Being overwhelmed with sorrow at the death of his
<div n="lb"/>mother, Paraśurāma swooned and fell down. When
<div n="lb"/>his anger subsided, discretion dawned on Jamadagni.
<div n="lb"/>He aroused his son and took him on his lap and asked
<div n="lb"/>him what boon he wanted for having accomplished
<div n="lb"/>the unaccomplishable task. Paraśurāma's request
<div n="lb"/>was that his mother should be brought to life again.
<div n="lb"/>The hermit was pleased and he brought Reṇukā to
<div n="lb"/>life again. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 60).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The sun gave Jamadagni an umbrella and sandals.%} See
<div n="lb"/>under the word Cerippu (Sandals).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The temptation of Dharma.%} See under the word
<div n="lb"/>‘Dharma’ Para 6.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Jamadagni was killed.%} Once Kārtavīryārjuna, with
<div n="lb"/>his minister Candragupta and some attendants had
<div n="lb"/>been hunting in the forests on the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā. It was noon. The hunters grew tired of
<div n="lb"/>hunger and thirst. They came to the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni. The hermit called his divine cow Suśīlā
<div n="lb"/>and ordered her to give food to the King and his party.
<div n="lb"/>Within a few seconds meals were got ready for
<div n="lb"/>thousands of people. The King and his attendants had
<div n="lb"/>a feast. On their return journey the wonderful cow
<div n="lb"/>Suśīlā was the subject of their talk. The King wanted
<div n="lb"/>to get the cow which possessed divine power. So he
<div n="lb"/>sent his minister Candragupta to the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni with instructions to get the cow Suśīlā in
<div n="lb"/>exchange for a crore of cows or even half of the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom. But the hermit was not prepared to give
<div n="lb"/>the cow. The minister and his men caught the cow
<div n="lb"/>by force and went away. The hermit, filled with grief,
<div n="lb"/>followed the party a long way through the forest, and
<div n="lb"/>requested Candragupta to return the cow. Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta got angry and struck him to death, and took the
<div n="lb"/>cow to the palace, in the capital city of Māhiṣmatī.
<div n="NI"/>After waiting for a long time, Reṇukā started in search
<div n="lb"/>of her husband. She saw Jamadagni lying almost dead,
<div n="lb"/>in a pool of blood. She fell down and beating her
<div n="lb"/>breast cried aloud. Paraśurāma with Akṛtavraṇa and
<div n="lb"/>other disciples came there. When she saw her son
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma, she beat her breast twentyone times
<F>1) Seeing his mother beating her breast twentyone times, Bhārgava caught hold of her hands and said “Mother, stop
<div n="lb"/>afflicting your body. Don't be sorry. I am here to end your sorrow. Since you have beaten your breast twentyone times, I will annihilate
<div n="lb"/>the Kṣatriya Kings twentyone times.” Bhārgava Rāma took an oath thus, to his mother.</F>
<div n="lb"/>and cried. Paraśurāma, took an oath that since his
<div n="lb"/>mother beat her breast twentyone times and cried, he
<div n="lb"/>would travel around twentyone times and put an end
<div n="lb"/>to the Kṣatriya Kings. After that they took the dead
<div n="lb"/>body of Jamadagni and placed it on fire, and began to
<div n="lb"/>sing the song of Viṣṇu. Then the hermit Śukra came
<div n="lb"/>by that way and with the help of Mṛtasañjīvanī
<div n="lb"/>brought Jamadagni to life again. The lost cow Suśīlā
<div n="lb"/>also returned without her calf. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 69; M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 49).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Death of Jamadagni.%} Paraśurāma and Akṛtavraṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to the city of Māhiṣmatī with the intention of
<div n="lb"/>bringing the calf of Suśīlā back. They stood at the
<div n="lb"/>gate of the city and challenged Kārtavīryārjuna for a
[Page341-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>fight. Kārtavīryārjuna came out with his army. In
<div n="lb"/>the battle which ensued, Kārtavīrya and his sons and
<div n="lb"/>most of his warriors fell dead. Paraśurāma and
<div n="lb"/>Akṛtavraṇa returned with the calf. Jamadagni asked
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma to go to Mahendragiri and do penance in
<div n="lb"/>order to mitigate the sin of killing a large number of
<div n="lb"/>people. When Paraśurāma had gone for penance,
<div n="lb"/>Śūrasena a son of Kārtavīryārjuna came with his men
<div n="lb"/>to the hermitage, cut off the head of Jamadagni and
<div n="lb"/>took it away. Paraśurāma and the disciples of
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni placed the dead body of Jamadagni on the
<div n="lb"/>pyre and burnt it. Reṇukā jumped into that fire and
<div n="lb"/>died. After this Paraśurāma began his twentyone
<div n="lb"/>tours for the extermination of the Kṣatriya Kings.
<div n="lb"/>(Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 86).
