<div n="NI"/>On the death of Śrutadhara, king of Ekalavyanagara the

<div n="lb"/>Śiva the boon that Satyadhara be killed while he him-
<div n="lb"/>self be made a gandharva. Owing to the blessing of

<div n="lb"/>the result of the curse of a muni. But, he remembered
<div n="lb"/>his previous existence, and, though turned into elephant
<div n="lb"/>could speak like men. Bhīmabhaṭa became a gandharva
<div n="lb"/>because he received and treated well once a traveller
<div n="lb"/>and related to him his (Bhīmabhaṭa's) own story.
