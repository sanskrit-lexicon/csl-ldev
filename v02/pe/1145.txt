BHĪMABHAṬA¦. A gandharva. The following story has
reference to his past life.
<div n="NI"/>On the death of Śrutadhara, king of Ekalavyanagara the
younger of his two sons, Satyadhara drove out of the
kingdom the elder brother, Śiladhara. Thus ousted from
his kingdom Śīladhara did due penance and got from
Śiva the boon that Satyadhara be killed while he him-
self be made a gandharva. Owing to the blessing of
Śiva Satyadhara died, and he was born again as Samara-
bhaṭa, son of Ugrabhaṭa, King of Rādhānagara, and
Śīladhara was born as Bhīmabhaṭa, brother of Samara-
bhaṭa. On the death of Ugrabhaṭa Bhīmabhaṭa, after
killing Samarabhaṭa ascended the throne. And, on one of
those days, he was transformed into a wild elephant as
the result of the curse of a muni. But, he remembered
his previous existence, and, though turned into elephant
could speak like men. Bhīmabhaṭa became a gandharva
because he received and treated well once a traveller
and related to him his (Bhīmabhaṭa's) own story.
