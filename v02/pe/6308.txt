SARGA¦ (CREATION). Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20
<div n="lb"/>refers to various sargas as follows.
<div n="NI"/>The first creation is that of greatness (Mahatva) i e.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. The second creation is that of tanmātras
<div n="lb"/>called bhūtasarga. The third is Vaikārikasarga also
<div n="lb"/>called Aindriyikasarga. These three kinds of creation
<div n="lb"/>are called Prākṛta sṛṣṭi (natural creation) and that is
<div n="lb"/>conscious and intelligent creation. The fourth is
<div n="lb"/>mukhyasarga. Mukhyas mean immovables. The fifth
<div n="lb"/>is tiryagyonisṛṣṭi. Since it functions side-long it is
<div n="lb"/>called tiryaksrotas. The sixth is the creation of Ūrdhva-
<div n="lb"/>srotas, called devasarga. The seventh is the creation
<div n="lb"/>of arvāksrotas, called mānuṣasarga. The eighth,
<div n="lb"/>anugrahasarga, is both sāttvic and tāmasic. Thus,
<div n="lb"/>vaikṛtasargas are five in number and prākṛtasargas
<div n="lb"/>three. The ninth sarga is the Kaumāra sarga, which
<div n="lb"/>is both vaikṛta and Prākṛta. The fundamental or
<div n="lb"/>root cause of the universe is the above nine creations
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. Prākṛtasarga is of three types, nitya
<div n="lb"/>(eternal), naimittika (casual) and dainandina (daily).
<div n="lb"/>Nityasarga is the creation after interim deluges.
