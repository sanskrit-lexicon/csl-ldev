ŚATAŚṚṄGA III¦. A mountain where Pāṇḍu once
practised austerities. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 118, Verse
50). The Pāṇḍavas were born here and they were
named in the presence of Munis who lived there. (Ādi
Parva, Chapter 122). Also, here it was that Pāṇḍu
died. Once in the course of a dream-trip of Arjuna in
the company of Kṛṣṇa to Kailāsa they saw Śataśṛṅga
also. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 80, Verse 32).
