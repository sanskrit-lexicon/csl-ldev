KUMUDVATĪ I¦. Wife of King Vimarśana of Kirāta-
<div n="lb"/>deśa. Kumudvatī requested him one day, to put a
<div n="lb"/>stop to his cruelties against the people. His reply was
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—“Oh! dear wife, don't feel sorry. In my
<div n="lb"/>past life I was a dog and, starved almost to death. I
<div n="lb"/>went to the gates of the Śiva temple at Pampāpura. It
<div n="lb"/>was Caturdaśī day, and thousands of people had
<div n="lb"/>gathered there, and I stood there looking at the
<div n="lb"/>Śivaliṅga. Then someone cried out, ‘Beat the dog to
<div n="lb"/>death,’ and though, in mortal terror, I ran thrice
<div n="lb"/>about the temple, people beat me to death. Since,
<div n="lb"/>although only by accident, I had run thrice around
<div n="lb"/>the temple, I was born as a King in the present life. I
<div n="lb"/>cherish the greatest devotion for Lord Śiva; but, as
<div n="lb"/>inherent tendencies do not die out so easily I possess
<div n="lb"/>certain characteristics of the dog and that is why I
<div n="lb"/>commit the present cruelties.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing her husband's past history Kumudvatī
<div n="lb"/>wanted to know about her past also, and Vimarśana
<div n="lb"/>said thus: “In the past life you were a she-dove. Once
<div n="lb"/>you sat on the top of a Pārvatī temple with a piece of
<div n="lb"/>flesh in your beak. Then another dove tried to snatch
<div n="lb"/>it from you, and with it you flew thrice round the
<div n="lb"/>temple. But, the other dove killed you and flew away
<div n="lb"/>with the piece of flesh. Since you flew around the
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī temple thrice you are now born as a queen.”
<div n="lb"/>Vimarśana told her this also that in the next birth she
<div n="lb"/>would be born as the daughter of King Sṛñjaya, as the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of the King of Kaliṅga in her third rebirth,
<div n="lb"/>as the daughter of the King of Magadha in her fourth
<div n="lb"/>birth, as the daughter of King Daśārṇa in her fifth
<div n="lb"/>birth, as the daughter of Yayāti in her sixth birth, as
<div n="lb"/>the daughter named Vasumatī of the King of Vidarbha
<div n="lb"/>in her seventh birth, and that ultimately she would
<div n="lb"/>attain salvation. Vimarśana in his next birth would
<div n="lb"/>likewise be born as the Sindhu King, as the King of
<div n="lb"/>Saurāṣṭra in his third birth, as the King of Gāndhāra
<div n="lb"/>in his fourth birth, as King of Avantī in his fifth birth,
<div n="lb"/>as King Ānarta in his sixth birth, as King of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍyas in his seventh birth, and that ultimately he
<div n="lb"/>too would attain salvation. Thus Vimarśana taught his
<div n="lb"/>wife that both of them would ultimately attain salvation
<div n="lb"/>as they had gone round the temple. (Śiva Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Caturdaśīmāhātmya).
