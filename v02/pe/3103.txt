KĀLAKAVṚKṢĪYA¦. An ancient Saint. During the
reign of the King Kṣemadarśin in the country of
Kosala, his subjects were put to great sufferings under
the misrule and corruption of his courtiers. At that time,
Kālakavṛkṣīya who was a friend of Kṣemadarśin and a
reputed sage, came to Kosala with a caged crow. The
sage went about the country claiming to know Kāka-
vidyā” (Vāyasī vidyā) by which a crow could be made
to tell past events. Actually, the sage was going round
the country in order to gather first-hand information
about the corrupt practices of the King's men. After
acquiring knowledge of the exact state of affairs in the
country, Kālakavṛkṣīya reached the palace. Under the
cloak of the crow's words he exposed some of the impro-
prieties of the King's Minister. Naturally, the Minister
was furious and by his secret instructions his servants
shot the crow to death that same night. On the next
day, the sage himself went to the King and convinced
him of the Minister's guilt. The King accepted the
sage's suggestions and brought about a thorough over-
haul of the administration by punishing or dismissing
the culprits. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 82).
<div n="NI"/>In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 106 we find
that this sage once advised Drupada to make a treaty
with King Kṣemadarśin. Kālakavṛkṣīya was a sage who
flourished in Indra's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 7).
