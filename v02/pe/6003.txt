ŚĀLIHOTRA¦. A muni of ancient days. Vyāsa had once
<div n="lb"/>lived in his āśrama. There was a tree near the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>which had outlived time. A drink of the water in the
<div n="lb"/>pond here quenches hunger and thirst. The tree and the
<div n="lb"/>pond were created by the power of Śālihotra's tapas.
<div n="lb"/>The Pāṇḍavas, during their life in exile in the forest,
<div n="lb"/>visited this place in the company of Hiḍimbī and
<div n="lb"/>quenched their hunger and thirst by drinking water
<div n="lb"/>from this pond. (M.B., Southern text, Chapter 154).
[Page674-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Śālihotra was an adept in aśvasastra (science about
<div n="lb"/>horses). To bathe in the tīrtha called Śālisūrya creat-
<div n="lb"/>ed by the muni is to derive the same result as that of
<div n="lb"/>making a gift of a thousand cows. (Vana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 71, Verse 27 and Chapter 83, Verse 107).
