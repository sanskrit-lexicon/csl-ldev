DHANVANTARI I¦. A deva who was a preceptor in
<div n="lb"/>Āyurveda.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} The devas and asuras together churned the
<div n="lb"/>milky ocean, Kṣīrābdhi, to salvage Amṛta (Nectar) from
<div n="lb"/>it. After thousand years there arose from the ocean a
<div n="lb"/>deva with a Kamaṇḍalu (water-pot of ascetics) in one
<div n="lb"/>hand and a daṇḍa in the other. That deva was Dhan-
<div n="lb"/>vantari, (Śloka 31, Sarga 45, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>The birth of Dhanvantari from the ocean of Milk is
<div n="lb"/>described in Chapter 29 of Harivaṃśa thus:
<div n="NI"/>Prosperous-looking Dhanvantari rising above the water-
<div n="lb"/>level of Kṣīrābdhi stood worshipping Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>gave him the name of Abja. Dhanvantari is thus known
<div n="lb"/>by the name of Abja also. Dhanvantari bowing to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu said “Prabho, I am your son. Allot to me
<div n="lb"/>yajñabhāga”.
<div n="NI"/>Vtṣṇu replied thus: “Portions of yajña have already
<div n="lb"/>been allotted. Because you were born after the devas
<div n="lb"/>you cannot be considered as one among them. You will
<div n="lb"/>be born again in the world for a second time and then you
<div n="lb"/>will be a celebrity. In your second life even from while
<div n="lb"/>in the womb you will have knowledge of Aṇimā and
<div n="lb"/>Garimā. Therefore you will be born as a deva incar-
<div n="lb"/>nate. You will write in eight divisions a book on
<div n="lb"/>Āyurveda; your second life will be in Dvāpara yuga.”
<div n="lb"/>After having said so much Viṣṇu disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Rebirth of Dhanvantari.%} Suhotra, King of Kāśi, in
<div n="lb"/>the second Dvāpara yuga had two sons, Śala and Gṛtsa-
<div n="lb"/>mada. Śunaka was the son of Gṛtsamada. Śala got a son,
<div n="lb"/>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa. Kāśa was born to Ārṣṭiṣeṇa. To Kāśa was
<div n="lb"/>born Dīrghatapas (Dhanvā). For a long time Dhanvā
<div n="lb"/>did not have any children and so he went and did
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Abjadeva. Abjadeva (Dhanvan-
<div n="lb"/>tari) was pleased and was born as a son to Dhanvā.
<div n="lb"/>Dhanvā named the boy as Dhanvantari and the latter
<div n="lb"/>taught his disciples Āyurveda, by parts, eight in num-
<div n="lb"/>ber. From Dhanvantari in order were born Ketumān—
<div n="lb"/>Bhīmaratha—Divodāsa. (Chapter 29, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Dhanvantari and Parikṣit.%} There is a story in the
<div n="lb"/>purāṇas that when Takṣaka went and bit Parīkṣit to
<div n="lb"/>kill him, a Viṣahāri (one who cures those infected with
<div n="lb"/>snake venom) rushed to save the king but was bribed
<div n="lb"/>and sent back by Takṣaka. There are indications in
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas to show that the Viṣahāri under reference
<div n="lb"/>was Dhanvantari though it is stated that Kaśyapa was
<div n="lb"/>the person involved. (See under Takṣaka).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Dhanvantari and Manasādevī.%} In the Kṛṣṇajanma
[Page223-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa of Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa there is a story
<div n="lb"/>connecting Dhanvantari with Manasādevī, a serpent-
<div n="lb"/>goddess.
<div n="NI"/>Once Dhanvantari with his disciples was going to Kailāsa.
<div n="lb"/>On the way Takṣaka made a venom-spitting hiss. At
<div n="lb"/>once one of the disciples of Dhanvantari boldly went
<div n="lb"/>and plucked the diamond on the head of Takṣaka and
<div n="lb"/>threw it to the ground. Hearing this Vāsuki, King of
<div n="lb"/>serpents, sent to Dhanvantari thousands of serpents
<div n="lb"/>under the leadership of Droṇa, Puṇḍarīka and Dhanañ-
<div n="lb"/>jaya. The poisonous breath of all these serpents joined
<div n="lb"/>together made the disciples of Dhanvantari swoon.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately Dhanvantari by a medicine made from
<div n="lb"/>vanaspati made all his disciples recover and then sent
<div n="lb"/>all the serpents to a swoon. When Vāsuki heard this
<div n="lb"/>he sent the serpent-maid, Manasādevī, a disciple of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, to face Dhanvantari. Manasādevī and Gaḍūra
<div n="lb"/>were both disciples of Śiva. But Dhanvantari was a
<div n="lb"/>follower of Gaḍūra. Manasādevī made all the disciples
<div n="lb"/>of Dhanvantari swoon but the latter because of his great
<div n="lb"/>proficiency is Viṣavidyā soon brought back his disciples
<div n="lb"/>to normal. When Manasādevī found that it was impos-
<div n="lb"/>sible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples by using
<div n="lb"/>poison Manasādevī took the triśūla given to her by Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and aimed it at Dhanvantari. Seeing this Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appeared before them and pacifying them sent
<div n="lb"/>them all their way.
