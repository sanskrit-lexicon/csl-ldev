ṚGVEDA¦. The Ṛgveda is the oldest recorded work of
the human race. The Egyptians claim that another book
entitled “Book of the Dead” was also written during the
period of the Ṛgveda. The Babylonians have an ancient
work called ‘Gilgamish’, which according to scholars, is
not as old as the Ṛgveda. Ṛgveda is the work that forms
the basis of Hindu religion. Of the four Vedas, Yajur-
veda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda were composed
after Ṛgveda.” The Ṛgveda sūktas were interpreted for
the first time in Yāska's “Nirukta” and Sāyaṇa's
“Vedārthaprakāśa”.
<div n="NI"/>The most important of the four Vedas is Ṛgveda. It
is divided into ten “Maṇḍalas”. There are 1017 sūktas
and 10472 Ṛks in it. Although there are 11 more
Sūktas called “khilas,” they are not usually included in
the Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>Maṇḍalas two to seven of the Ṛgveda were composed in
different Ṛṣikulas. The second Maṇḍala was of
Bhārgava Kula, the third of Viśvāmitrakula, the fourth
of Vāmadeva, the fifth of Atri, the sixth of Bharadvāja
and the seventh of Vasiṣṭha. The eighth Maṇḍala and the
first 50 Sūktas of the first Maṇḍala were composed by
Kaṇvakula. The general view is that the tenth Maṇḍala
was written by someone at a later period.
<div n="NI"/>Most of the Ṛgveda sūktas are praises. But some of the
Sūktas in the tenth Maṇḍala are of a different type.
We can see in many sūktas the joy and wonder
experienced by the Āryas when they entered the beauti-
ful land of India for the first time. Most scholars believe
that the Ṛgveda was composed during the period
between 2,500 and 2,000 B.C.

<div n="NI"/>{%Ancient Belief about Ṛgveda.%} The four Vedas—Ṛgveda,
Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda emerged from
the four faces of Brahmā. In Kṛtayuga, Brahmā gave
these Vedas to his sons. In Dvāparayuga, the Ṛṣis got
these Vedas. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated on earth for the
preservation of Dharma, in the person of Veda Vyāsa.
Vyāsa distributed the Vedas among his son Śākalya and
his disciples. Śākalya received Ṛgveda. He com-
municated it to his disciples. (Bhāgavata, 12th Skan-
dha. See under the word Veda).
