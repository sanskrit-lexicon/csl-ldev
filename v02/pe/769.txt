ĀRYAKA¦. A famous serpent. (Śloka 7, Chapter 35,
Ādi Parva, M.B.) Āryaka is associated with Bhīmasena
in the following story. Once Duryodhana gave snake
poison in his food to Bhīmasena. Unaware Bhīma took
his food as usual and went to bathe in the river. After
some time Bhīma became unconscious due to the effect
of the poison and fell flat in the river.
<div n="NI"/>Immediately Duryodhana bound him by ropes and put
him in more deep waters. Bhīma reaching the bottom
was bitten by all the snakes there. This fortunately
served as an antidote and the poison in Bhīma's body
was neutralized and Bhīma became his old self again
and killed all the serpents. Those serpents who escaped
went and brought their chief, Vāsuki. At that time it was
Āryaka who advised Vāsuki to give him ‘rasapāna’.
(Ślokas 64-68, Chapter 127, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
