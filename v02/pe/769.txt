<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, M.B.) Āryaka is associated with Bhīmasena
<div n="lb"/>in the following story. Once Duryodhana gave snake
<div n="lb"/>poison in his food to Bhīmasena. Unaware Bhīma took
<div n="lb"/>his food as usual and went to bathe in the river. After
<div n="lb"/>some time Bhīma became unconscious due to the effect
<div n="lb"/>of the poison and fell flat in the river.
<div n="NI"/>Immediately Duryodhana bound him by ropes and put
<div n="lb"/>him in more deep waters. Bhīma reaching the bottom
<div n="lb"/>was bitten by all the snakes there. This fortunately

<div n="lb"/>was neutralized and Bhīma became his old self again
<div n="lb"/>and killed all the serpents. Those serpents who escaped
<div n="lb"/>went and brought their chief, Vāsuki. At that time it was
