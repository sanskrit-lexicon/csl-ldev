<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Yuvanāśva, father of Māndhātā had a
hundred wives. Still he had no children. Greatly
griefstricken by the lack of a son he went to the forests
to see people of virtue and piety. During his
wandering in the forest he happened to reach a club
of sages. Yuvanāśva went and sat in their midst. He
was happy to be in their midst but was worried in his
mind and so he sent up deep sighs as he sat there sad and
śilent. The sages asked him why he looked so sad and
the King crying like a child told them the cause of his
grief. The sages took pity on him and made him
conduct the yāga ‘Indradaivata’. They brought a jug
of water made potent by recitals of mantras to be
given to the queens to make them pregnant and placed
the pot in the yāgaśālā. The yāga was coming to an
end. One day the King felt unusually thirsty and
unwilling to disturb the sages who were taking rest the
King entered the yāgaśālā and finding a jug there
full of water drank from it and quenched his thirst,
little knowing that it contained the water made
potent for a specific purpose by mantras. The next day
when the sages went to the yāgaśālā they found the
jug almost empty and were worried and started
making enquiries. The King then confessed what he
had done. The sages said that it was futile to fight
against fate and somehow finished the yāga and went
to their āśramas.
<div n="NI"/>The King became pregnant and after ten months a
child came out bursting open the right side of his
stomach. The King consulted his ministers as to
what should be done with the child and on their
advice the child was taken to the forests and left
there. But the child was protected by the Devas and
[Page476-a+ 64]
they enquired among themselves as to whose breast-
feeding it would get when Indra appeared and said
“Māṃ Dhātā”, meaning it would drink me. That was
how the child got the name ‘Māndhātā’. Indra thrust
the child's big toe into its mouth and the child began to
suck milk through it. Māndhātā who grew thus drink-
ing its own toe became a mighty man of renown. (7th
Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Administration of the state and marriage.%} When
Māndhātā became a man of great strength his father
died and he ascended the throne and became an
Emperor of great fame. He conquered many kingdoms.
He made his enemies flee from him. Because he inti-
midated the dasyus he got the name Trasadasyu. He
married the perfect-figured chaste daughter Bindumatī
of Śaśabindurāja. She got two sons named Purukutsa
and Mucukunda.
<div n="NI"/>The Purāṇas state that Māndhātā had another son
named Ambarīṣa and fifty daughters who were all
married to a sage named Saubhari.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How he caused rains in the country.%} Māndhātā ruled
the country very virtuously without at any time going
against truth and justice and his country became
prosperous. Once it so happened that there were no
rains for three successive years in the country and
the greatly worried King went to the forests to know
from the great sages there the reason for such a
calamity. The sages told the King thus: “Oh King,
of all yugas Kṛtayuga is the best. This yuga is a
brahmin-predominant one and Dharma stands on
four legs. Penance is for brahmins only and no man
of any other caste can do penance in this yuga. But
in your country a Śūdra is performing penance and
that is why the clouds refuse to shower rains. Kill him
and then the evil will go”. Hearing this Māndhātā
replied, “I will never kill an innocent ascetic. Teach
me my duty at this time of peril”. The sages were
pleased at the reply of the King and advised him thus:
“Oh King, start observing Vrata on the ekādaśī day.
(Eleventh day in each half of a month). The ekādaśī
which falls in the bright half of Bhādrapada is called
‘Padmanābha’, and if you observe it by its cogency you
will get not only rains but prosperity and happiness free
from misery of any kind. You must persuade your
subjects also to observe this”.
<div n="NI"/>The King on returning to his palace started observing
‘ekādaśī’ along with his subjects of all the four castes
and then it started to rain. Rains came in plenty and
all the crops were rich. The subjects became happy.
(Chapter 59, Padma Purāṇa).
