CANDRA III¦. The Purāṇas declare that Candra was
one of the invaluable things got at the churning of
Kṣīrābdhi (ocean of milk) Candra, Mahālakṣmī, Surā,
Uccaiḥśravas, Kaustubha, Pārijāta, Kāmadhenu,
Dhanvantari, Amṛtam and Kālakūṭa were the things
thus got from the Ocean of Milk. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 18 and Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 9). Also,
the evil devatā called Jyeṣṭhā, Airāvata, the gem
named Cintāmaṇi and fair damsels like Tārā and Rumā
were got from the Kṣīrābdhi, (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddhakāṇḍa). For general information about Candra,
