KĀMADHENU¦. (SURABHI—NANDINĪ).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} She is the first mother of cattle. She is a
<div n="lb"/>goddess with marvellous powers and attainments who
<div n="lb"/>gives milk whenever needed by gods and sages. The
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas declare that all the cattle in the world today
<div n="lb"/>are descended from Kāmadhenu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Three different names.%} This sacred cow is sometimes
<div n="lb"/>called “Kāmadhenu”, at other times, “Surabhi” and
<div n="lb"/>also “Nandinī”. They are not three different cows, as
<div n="lb"/>some people suppose. See Bhāṣā Bhārata, Araṇya Parva
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 9, Verses 7 and 17. There Surabhi and Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>dhenu are names used for referring to the same cow.
<div n="lb"/>Again, in the Bhāṣā Bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 99,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 14, we find the name Nandinī applied to Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>dhenu. Thus we may conclude that Kāmadhenu had
<div n="lb"/>two other names, viz. Surabhi and Nandinī. But since
<div n="lb"/>the term “Surabhirgavi” occurs in Amarakośa, it follows
<div n="lb"/>that even ordinary cows may be called “Surabhi”.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth and Jamily.%} In the Purāṇas Surabhi is des-
<div n="lb"/>cribed variously as Dakṣa's daughter, Kaśyapa's wife,
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa's daughter, etc. Although at first sight there
<div n="lb"/>may appear some discrepancy in these statements, in
<div n="lb"/>the light of them we may clearly arrive at the ancestry
<div n="lb"/>and birth of Surabhi. Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, 14th Sarga says that Kaśyapa, the son of Marīci
<div n="lb"/>and the grandson of Brahmā married Dakṣa Prajāpati's
<div n="lb"/>daughters—Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodha-
<div n="lb"/>vāśā, Manu and Analā. From verses 20 and 21 in the
<div n="lb"/>same Sarga we understand that Surabhi was the daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter of Krodhavaśā, Dakṣa's daughter, by Kaśyapa. In
<div n="lb"/>the same Sarga we find that two daughters, Rohiṇī and
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvī were born to this Surabhi and from Rohiṇī
<div n="lb"/>were born all the cows in the world that we see today
[Page380-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and from Gandharvī were born all the horses. It was
<div n="lb"/>by her own father Kaśyapa himself that Surabhi's off-
<div n="lb"/>springs were born. Therefore, the reference to Surabhi
<div n="lb"/>as the wife of Kaśyapa may also be justified.
<F>2) In Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter 15, Surabhi is described as Kaśyapa's wife.</F> Śince
<div n="lb"/>Krodhavaśā, the daughter of Dakṣa was the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi, actually Surabhi was the grand-daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa, But in a broad sense, a grand-daughter may be
<div n="lb"/>considered as a daughter. So the reference to Surabhi
<div n="lb"/>in Bhāṣā Bhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 83, Verse
<div n="lb"/>28 as Dakṣa's daughter is correct in that sense.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Kāmadhenu Received Divine Powers.%} Long ago Aditi,
<div n="lb"/>wife of Kaśyapa, conceived Mahāviṣṇu in her womb
<div n="lb"/>and began an austere penance standing on one leg. At
<div n="lb"/>that time Surabhi went to Kailāsa and offered worship
<div n="lb"/>to Brahmā for ten thousand years. The gods who were
<div n="lb"/>pleased, came to Surabhi taking Brahmā with them.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā said to her:—‘Surabhi I have made you a
<div n="lb"/>goddess. You are now above the three worlds—Heaven
<div n="lb"/>Earth and Hell. Your world, “Goloka” will become
<div n="lb"/>famous. All people will worship you and the cows who
<div n="lb"/>are your off spring.”
<div n="NI"/>From that day on which Brahmā blessed her, Surabhi
<div n="lb"/>became a goddess with marvellous spiritual powers.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 83).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%More than one Kāmadhenu?%} There are references to
<div n="lb"/>several Kāmadhenus in the Purāṇas. There is one Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>dhenu in Vāsiṣṭha's Āśrama. At Varuṇa's yāga we see
<div n="lb"/>another Kāmadhenu. There is no ground for believing
<div n="lb"/>that there is only one Kāmadhenu and that it was
<div n="lb"/>borrowed by each Deva in turn for some particular
<div n="lb"/>occasion. It is possible that there were many Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>dhenus in the family of Kāmadhenu and they were
<div n="lb"/>owned by different Devas. Moreover it is stated that
<div n="lb"/>several Kāmadhenus take their origin from sources
<div n="lb"/>other than the family of Kaśyapa. One of them is from
<div n="lb"/>the ocean of milk. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 18, we find that when the Devas and Asuras churned
<div n="lb"/>the ocean of milk, along with many other precious
<div n="lb"/>things, Kāmadhenu also came up to the surface.
<div n="NI"/>There is a reference to another Kāmadhenu in Bhāṣā
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 102, There, it is said,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā who got Amṛta swallowed it beyond limit in
<div n="lb"/>his avidity and when he vomited, a Kāmadhenu came
<div n="lb"/>out from his mouth. That Kāmadhenu is said to be
<div n="lb"/>living in the world known as Rasātala. The above-
<div n="lb"/>mentioned passage also says that there are four other
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenus living on the four sides of the Kāmadhenu
<div n="lb"/>which lives in Rasātala. They are Saurabhī in the east
<div n="lb"/>Haṃsikā in the south, Subhadrā in the west and Dhenu
<div n="lb"/>in the north.
<div n="NI"/>The next Kāmadhenu is the one which was born from
<div n="lb"/>the side of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa and his consort
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā were amusing themselves by amorous pleasures
<div n="lb"/>in a remote and secluded place. When they were tired
<div n="lb"/>they wished to drink some milk. At that time, Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>created by his will power, the cow Surabhi and the
<div n="lb"/>calf Manoratha, from the left side of his body. Śrī-
<div n="lb"/>dāman milked that cow into a new earthen pot and
<div n="lb"/>when Śrī Kṛṣna was drinking it, the pot fell down and
<div n="lb"/>the milk was spilt all over the floor. The milk which
<div n="lb"/>spread over an area of 100 yojanas, became a lake
<div n="lb"/>called “Kṣīrasāgara” for Rādhā and her maids to bathe
<div n="lb"/>and enjoy water-sports. Numerous cows were born
<div n="lb"/>from the pores of Surabhi and they were presented to the
[Page380-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Gopas by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (Devī Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha).
<div n="lb"/>Like this, several Kāmadhenus are seen in the Purāṇas.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore there is no discrepancy or contradiction in
<div n="lb"/>statements declaring that there were many Kāmadhenus
<div n="lb"/>in different Āśramas. But since Kāmadhenu had
<div n="lb"/>achieved divine powers by Brahmā's grace, it is but rea-
<div n="lb"/>sonable to believe that the different Kāmadhenus are
<div n="lb"/>really the different forms of the original Kāmadhenu,
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Theft of Kāmadhenu by Satyavrata (Triśaṅku).%} Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata (Triśaṅku) was the son of Aruṇa, a King of the
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku dynasty. He was a vicious and immoral fellow.
<div n="lb"/>Once he abducted a Brāhmaṇa girl just at the time of
<div n="lb"/>her marriage in her bridal dress. Enraged at this his
<div n="lb"/>father drove him away from his palace. Satyavrata
<div n="lb"/>wandered about aimlessly in the country and in the
<div n="lb"/>forests.
<div n="NI"/>Soon after this there was a famine in the land. Human
<div n="lb"/>beings and animals began to die of starvation. At that
<div n="lb"/>time Viśvāmitra was performing penance in the forest
<div n="lb"/>after leaving behind his wife and children in the country.
<div n="lb"/>When he saw that the whole family was in danger of
<div n="lb"/>death by starvation, he decided to make some money
<div n="lb"/>by selling one of the sons, in order to save the lives of
<div n="lb"/>the rest of the family. Satyavrata who came to know of
<div n="lb"/>this, met Viśvāmitra and dissuaded him from selling
<div n="lb"/>his son. He promised to supply some flesh every day to
<div n="lb"/>the family by hunting animals in the forest and keeping
<div n="lb"/>the flesh suspended from the branch of a near-by tree.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly, he began leaving the flesh regularly hang-
<div n="lb"/>ing from the branch of the tree. One day he
<div n="lb"/>could not get any flesh by hunting. That night he went
<div n="lb"/>to Vasiṣṭha's āśrama and stole Kāmadhenu. He killed
<div n="lb"/>the cow and ate some of its flesh. The rest he gave to
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra's family.
<div n="NI"/>The next morning when Vasiṣṭha woke up, he did not
<div n="lb"/>see his cow. But he came to know of the whole affair by
<div n="lb"/>his intuition. In his fury he cursed Satyavrata and said
<div n="lb"/>that the world would brand him with the name “Triśaṅ-
<div n="lb"/>ku” because he had committed three heinous sins viz. kill-
<div n="lb"/>ing of cows, abducting another man's wife and incurring
<div n="lb"/>his father's displeasure. After that Vasiṣṭha restored
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenu to life. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Viśvāmitra attacked Kāmadhenu.%} Once while Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra was a ruling King, he went into a forest to hunt.
<div n="lb"/>In the course of his rambles through the forest, he hap-
<div n="lb"/>pened to arrive at Vasiṣṭha's Āśrama with his retinue.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha called Kāmadhenu and ordered her to provide
<div n="lb"/>food for Viśvāmitra and his party. Kāmadhenu, by her
<div n="lb"/>divine powers, prepared food within a short time and
<div n="lb"/>gave them a sumptuous meal; Viśvāmitra was greatly
<div n="lb"/>pleased with this amazing feat of Kāmadhenu and he
<div n="lb"/>asked Vasiṣṭha to give her to him. He even offered to
<div n="lb"/>give crores of cows in return for her. But Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>refused to comply with his request. Then Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>tried to seize and take her away by force.
<div n="NI"/>At once Kāmadhenu assumed the form of a terrible
<div n="lb"/>monster of destruction. From the different parts of her
<div n="lb"/>body emerged fierce warriors who clashed with Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra's followers. All the arrows shot by Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>were caught by Vasiṣṭha with his hand. In the end
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra admitted that the might of a Brāhmaṇa is
<div n="lb"/>superior to the might of a Kṣatriya. (Vasiṣṭha was a
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa and Viśvāmitra a Kṣatriya). Viśvāmitra,
[Page381-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>soon gave up his kingly duties and began penance,
<div n="lb"/>thus turning himself into a “Rājarṣi” (Royal saint).
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 52nd Sarga; M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śalya Parva, Chapter 40; M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>175).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kāmadhenu was attacked by the Aṣṭa Vasus.%} (See under
<div n="lb"/>the word “Aṣṭavasus”, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Kāmadhenu cried.%} (See under the word “Indra”,
<div n="lb"/>Para 16).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Kāmadhenu revived King Baka.%} (See under the word
<div n="lb"/>“Gautama”).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kāmadhenu gave birth to Ajasa, Ekapāt, Ahir-
<div n="lb"/>budhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra. Viśvarūpa was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Tvaṣṭā. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kāmadhenu said that she had no part in the theft
<div n="lb"/>of Agastya's lotus. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>94).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Śrī Kṛṣṇa turned Govardhana mountain into an
<div n="lb"/>umbrella and defeated Indra when Kāmadhenu came
<div n="lb"/>to Gokula and bathed Śrī Kṛṣṇa with her milk accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once the sage Jamadagni went to Goloka and
<div n="lb"/>propitiated Kāmadhenu by his tapas. Kāmadhenu gave
<div n="lb"/>her sister Suśīlā to Jamadagni. The sage presented that
<div n="lb"/>cow to his. wife Reṇukā. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>61).
