KĀMADHENU¦. (SURABHI—NANDINĪ).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} She is the first mother of cattle. She is a
goddess with marvellous powers and attainments who
gives milk whenever needed by gods and sages. The
Purāṇas declare that all the cattle in the world today
are descended from Kāmadhenu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Three different names.%} This sacred cow is sometimes
called “Kāmadhenu”, at other times, “Surabhi” and
also “Nandinī”. They are not three different cows, as
some people suppose. See Bhāṣā Bhārata, Araṇya Parva
Chapter 9, Verses 7 and 17. There Surabhi and Kāma-
dhenu are names used for referring to the same cow.
Again, in the Bhāṣā Bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 99,
Verse 14, we find the name Nandinī applied to Kāma-
dhenu. Thus we may conclude that Kāmadhenu had
two other names, viz. Surabhi and Nandinī. But since
the term “Surabhirgavi” occurs in Amarakośa, it follows
that even ordinary cows may be called “Surabhi”.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth and Jamily.%} In the Purāṇas Surabhi is des-
cribed variously as Dakṣa's daughter, Kaśyapa's wife,
Kaśyapa's daughter, etc. Although at first sight there
may appear some discrepancy in these statements, in
the light of them we may clearly arrive at the ancestry
and birth of Surabhi. Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya
Kāṇḍa, 14th Sarga says that Kaśyapa, the son of Marīci
and the grandson of Brahmā married Dakṣa Prajāpati's
daughters—Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodha-
vāśā, Manu and Analā. From verses 20 and 21 in the
same Sarga we understand that Surabhi was the daugh-
ter of Krodhavaśā, Dakṣa's daughter, by Kaśyapa. In
the same Sarga we find that two daughters, Rohiṇī and
Gandharvī were born to this Surabhi and from Rohiṇī
were born all the cows in the world that we see today
[Page380-a+ 65]
and from Gandharvī were born all the horses. It was
by her own father Kaśyapa himself that Surabhi's off-
springs were born. Therefore, the reference to Surabhi
as the wife of Kaśyapa may also be justified.
<F>2) In Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter 15, Surabhi is described as Kaśyapa's wife.</F> Śince
Krodhavaśā, the daughter of Dakṣa was the mother of
Surabhi, actually Surabhi was the grand-daughter of
Dakṣa, But in a broad sense, a grand-daughter may be
considered as a daughter. So the reference to Surabhi
in Bhāṣā Bhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 83, Verse
28 as Dakṣa's daughter is correct in that sense.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Kāmadhenu Received Divine Powers.%} Long ago Aditi,
wife of Kaśyapa, conceived Mahāviṣṇu in her womb
and began an austere penance standing on one leg. At
that time Surabhi went to Kailāsa and offered worship
to Brahmā for ten thousand years. The gods who were
pleased, came to Surabhi taking Brahmā with them.
Brahmā said to her:—‘Surabhi I have made you a
goddess. You are now above the three worlds—Heaven
Earth and Hell. Your world, “Goloka” will become
famous. All people will worship you and the cows who
are your off spring.”
<div n="NI"/>From that day on which Brahmā blessed her, Surabhi
became a goddess with marvellous spiritual powers.
(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 83).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%More than one Kāmadhenu?%} There are references to
several Kāmadhenus in the Purāṇas. There is one Kāma-
dhenu in Vāsiṣṭha's Āśrama. At Varuṇa's yāga we see
another Kāmadhenu. There is no ground for believing
that there is only one Kāmadhenu and that it was
borrowed by each Deva in turn for some particular
occasion. It is possible that there were many Kāma-
dhenus in the family of Kāmadhenu and they were
owned by different Devas. Moreover it is stated that
several Kāmadhenus take their origin from sources
other than the family of Kaśyapa. One of them is from
the ocean of milk. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 18, we find that when the Devas and Asuras churned
the ocean of milk, along with many other precious
things, Kāmadhenu also came up to the surface.
<div n="NI"/>There is a reference to another Kāmadhenu in Bhāṣā
Bhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 102, There, it is said,
Brahmā who got Amṛta swallowed it beyond limit in
his avidity and when he vomited, a Kāmadhenu came
out from his mouth. That Kāmadhenu is said to be
living in the world known as Rasātala. The above-
mentioned passage also says that there are four other
Kāmadhenus living on the four sides of the Kāmadhenu
which lives in Rasātala. They are Saurabhī in the east
Haṃsikā in the south, Subhadrā in the west and Dhenu
in the north.
<div n="NI"/>The next Kāmadhenu is the one which was born from
the side of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa and his consort
Rādhā were amusing themselves by amorous pleasures
in a remote and secluded place. When they were tired
they wished to drink some milk. At that time, Śrī Kṛṣṇa
created by his will power, the cow Surabhi and the
calf Manoratha, from the left side of his body. Śrī-
dāman milked that cow into a new earthen pot and
when Śrī Kṛṣna was drinking it, the pot fell down and
the milk was spilt all over the floor. The milk which
spread over an area of 100 yojanas, became a lake
called “Kṣīrasāgara” for Rādhā and her maids to bathe
and enjoy water-sports. Numerous cows were born
from the pores of Surabhi and they were presented to the
[Page380-b+ 64]
Gopas by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (Devī Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha).
Like this, several Kāmadhenus are seen in the Purāṇas.
Therefore there is no discrepancy or contradiction in
statements declaring that there were many Kāmadhenus
in different Āśramas. But since Kāmadhenu had
achieved divine powers by Brahmā's grace, it is but rea-
sonable to believe that the different Kāmadhenus are
really the different forms of the original Kāmadhenu,
the daughter of Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Theft of Kāmadhenu by Satyavrata (Triśaṅku).%} Satya-
vrata (Triśaṅku) was the son of Aruṇa, a King of the
Ikṣvāku dynasty. He was a vicious and immoral fellow.
Once he abducted a Brāhmaṇa girl just at the time of
her marriage in her bridal dress. Enraged at this his
father drove him away from his palace. Satyavrata
wandered about aimlessly in the country and in the
forests.
<div n="NI"/>Soon after this there was a famine in the land. Human
beings and animals began to die of starvation. At that
time Viśvāmitra was performing penance in the forest
after leaving behind his wife and children in the country.
When he saw that the whole family was in danger of
death by starvation, he decided to make some money
by selling one of the sons, in order to save the lives of
the rest of the family. Satyavrata who came to know of
this, met Viśvāmitra and dissuaded him from selling
his son. He promised to supply some flesh every day to
the family by hunting animals in the forest and keeping
the flesh suspended from the branch of a near-by tree.
Accordingly, he began leaving the flesh regularly hang-
ing from the branch of the tree. One day he
could not get any flesh by hunting. That night he went
to Vasiṣṭha's āśrama and stole Kāmadhenu. He killed
the cow and ate some of its flesh. The rest he gave to
Viśvāmitra's family.
<div n="NI"/>The next morning when Vasiṣṭha woke up, he did not
see his cow. But he came to know of the whole affair by
his intuition. In his fury he cursed Satyavrata and said
that the world would brand him with the name “Triśaṅ-
ku” because he had committed three heinous sins viz. kill-
ing of cows, abducting another man's wife and incurring
his father's displeasure. After that Vasiṣṭha restored
Kāmadhenu to life. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Viśvāmitra attacked Kāmadhenu.%} Once while Viśvā-
mitra was a ruling King, he went into a forest to hunt.
In the course of his rambles through the forest, he hap-
pened to arrive at Vasiṣṭha's Āśrama with his retinue.
Vasiṣṭha called Kāmadhenu and ordered her to provide
food for Viśvāmitra and his party. Kāmadhenu, by her
divine powers, prepared food within a short time and
gave them a sumptuous meal; Viśvāmitra was greatly
pleased with this amazing feat of Kāmadhenu and he
asked Vasiṣṭha to give her to him. He even offered to
give crores of cows in return for her. But Vasiṣṭha
refused to comply with his request. Then Viśvāmitra
tried to seize and take her away by force.
<div n="NI"/>At once Kāmadhenu assumed the form of a terrible
monster of destruction. From the different parts of her
body emerged fierce warriors who clashed with Viśvā-
mitra's followers. All the arrows shot by Viśvāmitra
were caught by Vasiṣṭha with his hand. In the end
Viśvāmitra admitted that the might of a Brāhmaṇa is
superior to the might of a Kṣatriya. (Vasiṣṭha was a
Brāhmaṇa and Viśvāmitra a Kṣatriya). Viśvāmitra,
[Page381-a+ 65]
soon gave up his kingly duties and began penance,
thus turning himself into a “Rājarṣi” (Royal saint).
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 52nd Sarga; M.B.
Śalya Parva, Chapter 40; M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
175).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kāmadhenu was attacked by the Aṣṭa Vasus.%} (See under
the word “Aṣṭavasus”, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Kāmadhenu cried.%} (See under the word “Indra”,
Para 16).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Kāmadhenu revived King Baka.%} (See under the word
“Gautama”).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kāmadhenu gave birth to Ajasa, Ekapāt, Ahir-
budhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra. Viśvarūpa was the son of
Tvaṣṭā. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kāmadhenu said that she had no part in the theft
of Agastya's lotus. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
94).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Śrī Kṛṣṇa turned Govardhana mountain into an
umbrella and defeated Indra when Kāmadhenu came
to Gokula and bathed Śrī Kṛṣṇa with her milk accord-
ing to Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once the sage Jamadagni went to Goloka and
propitiated Kāmadhenu by his tapas. Kāmadhenu gave
her sister Suśīlā to Jamadagni. The sage presented that
cow to his. wife Reṇukā. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter
61).
