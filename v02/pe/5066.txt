ARṆAŚĀLĀ¦. A Village situated in the valley of the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Yāmuna. This mountain stands between the
<div n="lb"/>rivers Gaṅgā and Yamunā. During the period of
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata this village was the abode of a great
<div n="lb"/>number of eminent scholars. Once there lived in that
<div n="lb"/>village a brahmin of Agastyagotra, well-learned, named
<div n="lb"/>Śarmī. One day the messengers of Kāla (god of death)
<div n="lb"/>came to that village and by mistake took Śarmī to
<div n="lb"/>Yamaloka. It was only when they reached there that
<div n="lb"/>they understood their folly and Kāla then asked his
<div n="lb"/>men to carry him back to earth. Then Śarmī said he
<div n="lb"/>would spend the balance of life due to him in Yama-
<div n="lb"/>loka itself. But Yama did not allow that. Kāla then
<div n="lb"/>told Śarmī the greatness in giving as gifts Til and
<div n="lb"/>Vastra (Gingelly and clothes) and sent him back to
<div n="lb"/>earth. (Chapter 68, Anuśāsana Parva).
