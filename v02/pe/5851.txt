RURU II¦. A mighty and valiant Asura. After procur-
ing a boon from Brahmā, Ruru became arrogant and
attacked the realm of gods. The Devas who were de-
feated by Ruru ran to the Blue mountain and prostrat-
ed before the goddess Śakti, who had been doing
penance there. This goddess Śakti had been born from
the matted hair of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Ruru followed the Devas and reached the Blue moun-
tain. When Devī saw Ruru and his mighty army a
loud laugh burst out from her. From that laugh thou-
sands of devilish figures came into existence. They
completely annihilated the army of Ruru. After this
Devī killed Ruru with the nail of her toe. (Padma
Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa).
