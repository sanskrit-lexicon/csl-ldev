RURU II¦. A mighty and valiant Asura. After procur-
<div n="lb"/>ing a boon from Brahmā, Ruru became arrogant and
<div n="lb"/>attacked the realm of gods. The Devas who were de-
<div n="lb"/>feated by Ruru ran to the Blue mountain and prostrat-
<div n="lb"/>ed before the goddess Śakti, who had been doing
<div n="lb"/>penance there. This goddess Śakti had been born from
<div n="lb"/>the matted hair of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Ruru followed the Devas and reached the Blue moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain. When Devī saw Ruru and his mighty army a
<div n="lb"/>loud laugh burst out from her. From that laugh thou-
<div n="lb"/>sands of devilish figures came into existence. They
<div n="lb"/>completely annihilated the army of Ruru. After this
<div n="lb"/>Devī killed Ruru with the nail of her toe. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa).
