MUÑJAVĀN¦. A mountain. This is in the range of
the Himālayas. Paramaśiva performs his frequent
penances at this place. Śiva freely rambles for
pleasure with his army of goblins in the caves and
shades of trees in this place. Everyday the Sādhyas,
Rudras, Viśvadevatās, Vasus, Yama, Varuṇa, Bhūtas,
devils, Nāsatyas, Aśvins, Gandharvas, celestial
maidens, Yakṣas, Devarṣis, Ādityas, Maruts, and
Yātudhānas come to this mountain to worship Śiva.
There is neither heat nor cold here. Greying of hairs or
rugosity is unknown here. There is no hunger or
thirst either. None dies here. On the sides of this
mountain gold lies spread like sunlight. (Verses 1-12
Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 8).
