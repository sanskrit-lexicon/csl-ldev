MUÑJAVĀN¦. A mountain. This is in the range of
<div n="lb"/>the Himālayas. Paramaśiva performs his frequent
<div n="lb"/>penances at this place. Śiva freely rambles for
<div n="lb"/>pleasure with his army of goblins in the caves and
<div n="lb"/>shades of trees in this place. Everyday the Sādhyas,
<div n="lb"/>Rudras, Viśvadevatās, Vasus, Yama, Varuṇa, Bhūtas,
<div n="lb"/>devils, Nāsatyas, Aśvins, Gandharvas, celestial
<div n="lb"/>maidens, Yakṣas, Devarṣis, Ādityas, Maruts, and
<div n="lb"/>Yātudhānas come to this mountain to worship Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>There is neither heat nor cold here. Greying of hairs or
<div n="lb"/>rugosity is unknown here. There is no hunger or
<div n="lb"/>thirst either. None dies here. On the sides of this
<div n="lb"/>mountain gold lies spread like sunlight. (Verses 1-12
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 8).
