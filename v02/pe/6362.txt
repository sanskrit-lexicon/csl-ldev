<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Devī born out of (1/6) part of original
<div n="lb"/>nature (Mūlaprakṛti). Since she was born out of 16
<div n="lb"/>part, she is called Ṣaṣṭhīdevī. Also called Devasenā,
<div n="lb"/>Ṣaṣṭhīdevī is the patron-devī of children. She grants
<div n="lb"/>them life. She protects them as the real mother and
<div n="lb"/>always remains by their side. She has earned Siddhis
<div n="lb"/>by the practice of yoga, is the best among the aṣṭamātṛs
<div n="lb"/>(eight mothers) and is the wife of Subrahmaṇya.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Blessings of the Devī.%} She is foremost among the
<div n="lb"/>devīs, who bless children. There is a story in the ninth
<div n="lb"/>canto of Devī Bhāgavata revealing the importance of
<div n="lb"/>Ṣaṣṭhīdevī.
<div n="NI"/>Though Priyavrata, son of Svāyambhuva Manu was at
<div n="lb"/>first averse to marriage he, at last, married, on the
<div n="lb"/>insistence of Brahmā, a woman called Mālinī. For long
<div n="lb"/>he had no issues and sad at heart he got a putrakāmeṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>yajña performed by Kaśyapaprajāpati as a result of
<div n="lb"/>which Mālinī got pregnant, and delivered in the twelfth
<div n="lb"/>year. But, the child was still-born and Priyavrata set out
<div n="lb"/>with the corpse for the burning ghat. But, he could
<div n="lb"/>not make up his mind to give it up and so decided
<div n="lb"/>himself also to court death. Then he saw a divine plane
<div n="lb"/>stop there with a woman in it, who spoke to him as
<div n="lb"/>follows: “I am Devasenādevī, the mental daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and wife of Skandadeva. It is I, who grant son
<div n="lb"/>to the sonless, wife to the wifeless, husband to the
<div n="lb"/>husbandless, wealth to the poor and the results of their
[Page700-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>actions to all.” So saying the Devī took from Priyavrata
<div n="lb"/>the corpse of his child and brought it back to life.
