<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Devī born out of (1/6) part of original
nature (Mūlaprakṛti). Since she was born out of 16
part, she is called Ṣaṣṭhīdevī. Also called Devasenā,
Ṣaṣṭhīdevī is the patron-devī of children. She grants
them life. She protects them as the real mother and
always remains by their side. She has earned Siddhis
by the practice of yoga, is the best among the aṣṭamātṛs
(eight mothers) and is the wife of Subrahmaṇya.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Blessings of the Devī.%} She is foremost among the
devīs, who bless children. There is a story in the ninth
canto of Devī Bhāgavata revealing the importance of
Ṣaṣṭhīdevī.
<div n="NI"/>Though Priyavrata, son of Svāyambhuva Manu was at
first averse to marriage he, at last, married, on the
insistence of Brahmā, a woman called Mālinī. For long
he had no issues and sad at heart he got a putrakāmeṣṭi
yajña performed by Kaśyapaprajāpati as a result of
which Mālinī got pregnant, and delivered in the twelfth
year. But, the child was still-born and Priyavrata set out
with the corpse for the burning ghat. But, he could
not make up his mind to give it up and so decided
himself also to court death. Then he saw a divine plane
stop there with a woman in it, who spoke to him as
follows: “I am Devasenādevī, the mental daughter of
Brahmā and wife of Skandadeva. It is I, who grant son
to the sonless, wife to the wifeless, husband to the
husbandless, wealth to the poor and the results of their
[Page700-b+ 64]
actions to all.” So saying the Devī took from Priyavrata
the corpse of his child and brought it back to life.
