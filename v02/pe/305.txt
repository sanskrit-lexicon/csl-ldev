AṄGĀRAKA I¦. An Asura who took the form of a pig.
<div n="lb"/>The story of how this Asura was killed by his daughter
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgāravatī, is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there was an emperor named Mahendra-
<div n="lb"/>varmā in Ujjayinī. His son Mahāsena did penance for
<div n="lb"/>a long time to get a wife and a sword. At last Devī
<div n="lb"/>appeared and granted the boon: “My son! take this
<div n="lb"/>extraordinary sword. So long as you have this sword,
<div n="lb"/>your enemies will not prevail against you. Aṅgāravatī,
<div n="lb"/>the renowned beauty of the three worlds, who is the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of the Asura Aṅgāraka, will become your
<div n="lb"/>wife in due course. As you do horrible deeds, you will
<div n="lb"/>be called Caṇḍamahāsena”. He was given the sword
<div n="lb"/>and a tusker called Naḍāgiri. One day Mahāsena went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest for hunting. He saw a very large pig. The
<div n="lb"/>King used his arrows. But they did little harm to the
<div n="lb"/>pig. Moreover it turned the chariot of the King over
<div n="lb"/>to one side and ran to a cave. The King followed it
<div n="lb"/>with fury. On the way he sat on the bank of a lake
<div n="lb"/>with wonder, for a lady of exquisite beauty was walk-
<div n="lb"/>ing along the mossy turf in the midst of some maids.
<div n="lb"/>Slowly she approached the King and talked with him.
<div n="lb"/>The young lady had entirely captured the heart of the
<div n="lb"/>King, who told her everything. She began to weep.
<div n="lb"/>“Who are you? Why do you weep?” The King asked
[Page039-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>her. She replied with a deep sigh. “The pig you saw,
<div n="lb"/>is my father Aṅgārakāsura. His body is as hard as
<div n="lb"/>diamond and not vulnerable to any sort of weapon.
<div n="lb"/>These maids have been caught by him from various
<div n="lb"/>royal houses and brought here for my help. My name
<div n="lb"/>is Aṅgāravatī. My father was changed to a giant by a
<div n="lb"/>curse. Now he is asleep discarding the form of pig.
<div n="lb"/>When he wakes up, filled with hunger and thirst, he
<div n="lb"/>will do you harm. My tears flowed out in the form of
<div n="lb"/>heated life-breaths, when I thought of these things.”
<div n="NI"/>The King said, “Go and sit by him and cry when he
<div n="lb"/>wakes up. He will ask the reason. Then tell him that
<div n="lb"/>you had been crying, when you thought how forlorn
<div n="lb"/>you would be without a mate, in case your father was
<div n="lb"/>killed by somebody”. Aṅgāravatī did as she was told.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing her words Aṅgāraka said, “My daughter! No
<div n="lb"/>body can kill me. My body is made of diamond. There
<div n="lb"/>is only one vulnerable point in my body which is on
<div n="lb"/>my left forearm and it is always covered with my
<div n="lb"/>bow.”
<div n="NI"/>The king hid himself closely and heard everything. He
<div n="lb"/>fought with the Asura and hitting at the vulnerable
<div n="lb"/>point killed him. The king married Aṅgāravatī and
<div n="lb"/>took her to his palace. Two sons were born to him.
<div n="lb"/>They were called Gopālaka and Pālaka. By the grace
<div n="lb"/>of Indra a daughter also was born to him by her and
<div n="lb"/>she was Vāsavadattā, the wife of the famous Udayana.
