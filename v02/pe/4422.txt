MARUTTA I¦. A wealthy king who lived in Kṛtayuga.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
order:—Brahmā, Marīci, Kaśyapa, Vivasvān, Vaivas-
vata Manu, Mahābāhu, Prasandhi, Kṣupa, Ikṣvāku,
Viṃśa, Kalyāṇa, Khanīnetra, Suvarcas, Karandhama
and Marutta.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Marutta got gold.%} As soon as Marutta became
king he began to perform a Yāga. Money was required
for it. He was puzzled as to how to raise funds. Be-
sides, Indra was trying to obstruct the Yāga. At last
he consulted Nārada who told him that Bṛhaspati's
brother Saṃvartaka was performing tapas in the forest
and if Marutta approached him, he would give him
enough money for this purpose. So Marutta went to
Saṃvartaka. He advised Marutta to worship Śiva.
Accordingly Marutta went to Kailāsa and got plenty
of gold by worshipping Śiva and returned with it and
[Page490-b+ 64]
began his Yāga. In spite of their efforts, Indra and other
gods were not able to spoil Marutta's Yāga. After the
Yāga Marutta stored up the surplus wealth in the
neighbourhood of Himālayas where his capital was
situated.
<div n="NI"/>After the Bhārata Yuddha, Dharmaputra was in need
of money to re-establish his administration and for
conducting an Aśvamedha yāga. At that time sage
Vyāsa informed him about the gold which Marutta
had left in the neighbourhood of the Himālayas.
It was by fetching that gold that the Pāṇḍavas conduct-
ed their Aśvamedhayāga. (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva,
Chapters 3-10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marutta and Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa started on
a triumphal tour in his Puṣpaka Vimāna with his
followers. It was at that time that Marutta was per-
forming his famous Yāga. The various gods were also
present on that occasion. Alarmed at the sight of
Rāvaṇa who was invincible by virtue of a boon he had
received, the gods assumed the shape of different
animals and birds. Indra became a peacock, Dharma-
rāja (Yama) became a crow; Kubera became a
chameleon; Varuṇa transformed himself into a swan,
and so on. Rāvaṇa entered the precincts of the Yajña
and said to Marutta:—“Either you fight with
me, or else admit defeat from me.” To this Marutta
replied calmly:—“May I know who you are?”
Rāvaṇa answered with a smile of contempt:—“I am
amused at your strange pretence! Do you mean to say
that you do not know Rāvaṇa who is the younger
brother of Kubera? There is no one but you in all
the three worlds, who does not know me. I have won
the Puṣpakavimāna after defeating my elder brother.”
Marutta retorted with bitter irony:—“As a younger
brother who has defeated his elder brother, you are
certainly a great man. There is no praiseworthy hero
equal to you in all these three worlds. Do you brag
that you have defeated your elder brother? I do not
know whether you have received the boon by your
righteous conduct. I have not heard the stories which
you have told just now. You wicked fellow, stop there!
I don't think that you will return alive!” Saying
this Marutta took his bow and arrows and got ready
for a fight.
<div n="NI"/>But Saṃvartaka stopped Marutta saying “O King!
If you would please heed my advice, do not prepare
for a fight here. We have started “Maheśvarasatra”.
If we do not bring it to a conclusion, the whole family
will come to an end. One who performs this Yāga
should not be engaged in a fight. He should not even
become a victim to anger. This Rākṣasa (Rāvaṇa) is
invincible. Your victory is doubtful.” At this,
Marutta put down his bow and began to occupy
himself again with the affairs of the Yajña. Just then
Śukra shouted, “Rāvaṇa has won.” The Rākṣasas and
their leader Rāvaṇa continued their tour after eating
the Maharṣis who had come to take part in the Yāga.
After Rāvaṇa left the place, the Devas resumed their own
forms. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other Details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Marutta flourished in Yama's assembly. (M.B.
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Marutta is considered as one of the “Pañcamahā-
samrāṭs” (five great emperors). The five great emperors
[Page491-a+ 50]
are—Yuvanāśva, Bhagīratha, Kārtavīrya, Bharata and
Marutta. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once Śiva presented him a golden peak of the
Himālayas. Indra, Bṛhaspati and other Devas attended
Marutta's assembly. His Yajñamaṇḍapas were all
golden. His cooks were groups of Maruts. He was able
to make all his subjects strong and healthy. In Māhā-
bhārata, Droṇa Parva, Chapter 55, we see that Marutta
ruled over the country for 1000 years as an ideal
emperor.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once Marutta received a sword from King Mucu-
kunda. Marutta gave it to Raivata. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter, 166, Verse 77).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Marutta gave his daughter to Aṅgiras and attained
Heaven according to Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva,
Chapter 234. Verse 18.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) In Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha, we find a passage
which says that since Marutta had no sons he had
adopted Duṣyanta, a King of the Pūru dynasty, as his
son.
