BĀLI¦. A mighty monkey-king.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Bāli is the son of Indra. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>about the birth of Bāli as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Śīlavatī who was devoted to her husband once carried
<div n="lb"/>her husband Ugratapas who was a leper, on her shoul-
<div n="lb"/>der to the house of a harlot one night. On the way
<div n="lb"/>they saw the hermit Aṇimāṇḍavya, who had been
<div n="lb"/>placed on a trident by the order of the King, beating
<div n="lb"/>his limbs with agony. Lying on the trident he saw
<div n="lb"/>Ugratapas. Seeing the amorous nature of Ugratapas
<div n="lb"/>Aṇimāṇḍavya cursed him that before sunrise he would
<div n="lb"/>die. Śīlavatī who was a woman of great purity and
<div n="lb"/>loyalty hearing the curse said, “Let the Sun not rise
<div n="lb"/>tomorrow.”
<div n="NI"/>Next day, though it was time the sun did not rise. The
<div n="lb"/>night prolonged. Aruṇa the charioteer was ready at the
<div n="lb"/>usual time but saw the Sun sitting motionless. Wast-
<div n="lb"/>ing time was intolerable to the charioteer. So he decid-
<div n="lb"/>ed to make the best use of the time at his disposal by
<div n="lb"/>witnessing a little of the dance of the celestial beauties
<div n="lb"/>in the realm of the devas. But males had no admittance
<div n="lb"/>there. So Aruṇa took the shape of a beautiful woman
<div n="lb"/>and got in. Seeing a new person, very beautiful to
<div n="lb"/>look at, sitting in the midst of the celestial maids Indra
<div n="lb"/>grew amorous. He secretly took her to a dark place
<div n="lb"/>and a son was born out of that coition. That son is Bāli.
<div n="lb"/>When Aruṇa returned the Sun was standing full of
<div n="lb"/>anger. Being afraid of him Aruṇa confessed everything
<div n="lb"/>to the Sun. When he heard the whole story the Sun
<div n="lb"/>expressed his desire to see that figure which Aruṇa had
<div n="lb"/>adopted. Accordingly Aruṇa again became a woman.
<div n="lb"/>The Sun also had coition with her and Sugrīva was
<div n="lb"/>the son born out of this coition. Bāli and Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>were brought up by Ahalyādevī in the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Gautama.
<div n="NI"/>At that time a monkey-king named Ṛkṣarāja had been
<div n="lb"/>ruling over the forest with Kiṣkindha as his capital.
<div n="lb"/>He had no sons and so he approached Indra and placed
<div n="lb"/>before him his grievances. Indra brought Bāli and
[Page105-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva from the hermitage of Gautama and handed
<div n="lb"/>them over to Ṛkṣarajas. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 107;
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 42; Uttara Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Kampa Rāmāyaṇa, Pūrvakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage and Kingship.%} Owing to difference of opini-
<div n="lb"/>on, Bāli defeated the asuras who came for the churning
<div n="lb"/>of the Sea of Milk. The devas who were pleased at
<div n="lb"/>this, gave Bāli, a woman named Tārā, derived from
<div n="lb"/>the Sea of Milk. Thus Tārā became his wife and he got
<div n="lb"/>a son by her, named Aṅgada who became famous as a
<div n="lb"/>mighty warrior-prince. Sugrīva married Rumā. At that
<div n="lb"/>time Ṛkṣarāja died and Bāli became King. (Kampa
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Pūrvakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Enmity with Hanūmān.%} It was during this period
<div n="lb"/>that Hanumān was born. While Śiva and Pārvatī were
<div n="lb"/>living in the forest as monkeys Pārvatī got with child.
<div n="lb"/>The child was given to Bhagavān Vāyu (Wind-God)
<div n="lb"/>with the womb. Vāyu placed the womb with the child
<div n="lb"/>in Añjanā Devī's stomach. Nārada informed Bāli all these
<div n="lb"/>things. Bāli thought that his position would be lost, if
<div n="lb"/>a being born of Śiva, grew up in the form of a monkey.
<div n="lb"/>In accordance with the advice of Nārada, Bāli melted
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaloha (Five metals) and passed it into the womb
<div n="lb"/>of Añjanā. Still the child in the womb was not killed
<div n="lb"/>as it was the sperm of Śiva. The molten metals became
<div n="lb"/>earrings of the child in the womb. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Pūrvakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Sugrīva separated.%} Once, the son of Maya, the car-
<div n="lb"/>penter of the asuras, wanted to defeat Bāli by a
<div n="lb"/>combat or cunning sleights as he was an expert wrest-
<div n="lb"/>ler and magician. He came to Kiṣkindhā in the mid-
<div n="lb"/>night and standing before the palace, challenged Bāli,
<div n="lb"/>who getting angry came out followed by Sugrīva. See-
<div n="lb"/>ing the two of them the magician began to run. Bāli
<div n="lb"/>and Sugrīva chased him to a cave. Placing Sugrīva at
<div n="lb"/>the mouth of the cave Bāli followed the magician. Be-
<div n="lb"/>fore going, Bāli said to Sugrīva: “Brother, I will go in
<div n="lb"/>and kill the Magician and return. Be brave and stay
<div n="lb"/>here. If the asura dies milk will appear at the mouth
<div n="lb"/>of the cave and if he kills me blood will be seen. If the
<div n="lb"/>latter happens close the mouth of the cave firmly and
<div n="lb"/>return to Kiṣkindhā and live happily there.”
<div n="NI"/>Bāli did not return even after a year. Finally the asura
<div n="lb"/>was killed. But by the cunning sleights of the magician
<div n="lb"/>it was blood that appeared at the mouth of the cave.
<div n="lb"/>Thinking that his brother was slain by the magician
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva felt sorry. Then he closed the mouth of the cave
<div n="lb"/>firmly with stone and returned to Kiṣkīndhā. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>about the death of Bāli the monkeys anointed Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>as King. After a time Bāli returned stronger than before
<div n="lb"/>and saw the mouth of the cave closed. He thought that
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva had closed the mouth of the cave deliberately
<div n="lb"/>to kill him and to usurp his throne. Bāli reached
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā and drove Sugrīva away. Śugrīva fled to
<div n="lb"/>Mount Ṛśyamūkācala which was prohibited area for
<div n="lb"/>Bāli due to a curse. Mātaṅga had cursed him that if
<div n="lb"/>he entered that mountain his head would be broken.
<div n="lb"/>So Sugrīva was safe in that mountain.
<div n="NI"/>The desire of Bāli to take revenge on Sugrīva increased
<div n="lb"/>everyday. Everyday he used to go to the four sea-
<div n="lb"/>shores and conduct bath, prayer, meditation etc. and
<div n="lb"/>return to Kiṣkindhā within a short time. With one
<div n="lb"/>jump he will reach one place from another, and in
<div n="lb"/>each jump he would put one step on the head of
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva in the Ṛśyamūkācala. Hanumān was the
[Page106-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>minister of Sugrīva. He was much annoyed at this
<div n="lb"/>habitual torture of Sugrīva. One day as usual Bāli
<div n="lb"/>was stepping on the head of Sugrīva to jump to another
<div n="lb"/>place, when Hanumān caught hold of Bāli by his waist.
<div n="lb"/>Hanumān thought that if Bāli was dragged down on
<div n="lb"/>the mountain somehow or other, his head would break
<div n="lb"/>and there would be an end of his wicked deeds. Bāli
<div n="lb"/>thought that if he could jump into Kiṣkindhā with
<div n="lb"/>Hanumān it would be easy for him to destroy Sugrīva.
<div n="lb"/>But both were of equal strength. So Bālī did not jump
<div n="lb"/>with Hanumān to Kiṣkindhā and Hanumān did not
<div n="lb"/>drag Bāli to the ground. Both did not know how to
<div n="lb"/>stop the fight. At last they made a treaty. Bāli agreed
<div n="lb"/>to stop torturing Sugrīva and Hanumān agreed not to
<div n="lb"/>cause any trouble to Bāli. Both returned to their own
<div n="lb"/>places. After that Sugrīva lived in Ṛśyamūkācala with
<div n="lb"/>his ministers and Bāli in Kiṣkindhā. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 10; Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Pūrvakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>5) Bāli was cursed by Mātaṅga the great hermit. See
<div n="lb"/>the word Dundubhi para 4.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Defeating Rāvaṇa.%} Bāli had got a boon from the
<div n="lb"/>Gods that he would get half the strength of his oppo-
<div n="lb"/>nent who stood face to face with him in fight. This
<div n="lb"/>power enabled Bāli to defeat all his foes and bring the
<div n="lb"/>countries in all directions under his sway. Rāvaṇa heard
<div n="lb"/>about this and decided to overpower Bāli somehow or
<div n="lb"/>other and approached Kiṣkindhā. Bāli knew this. His
<div n="lb"/>minister, Tāran, went to Rāvaṇa and told him about
<div n="lb"/>the power of Bāli and of the boon by which Bāli got
<div n="lb"/>half the strength of his opponent. When Rāvaṇa heard
<div n="lb"/>of this peculiar boon he decided to kill Bāli. His idea
<div n="lb"/>was to kill Bāli by going behind him when he went to
<div n="lb"/>the sea-shore to take bath in the morning.
<div n="NI"/>Next morning Bāli went to the eastern sea-shore and
<div n="lb"/>began his prayer and meditation. Rāvaṇa approached
<div n="lb"/>Bāli from behind and sat close to him. Perhaps the
<div n="lb"/>idea of Rāvaṇa might have been to take Bāli by his
<div n="lb"/>tail and beat him on the ground. Bāli knew that
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa was sitting behind him. But pretending that
<div n="lb"/>he knew nothing put his long tail on the body of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, and passed it lengthwise and breadthwise
<div n="lb"/>through every part of his body and tied him like a
<div n="lb"/>bundle of faggots, and made a jump into the air.
<div n="lb"/>Within a short time he visited all the usual places and
<div n="lb"/>reached Kiṣkindhā. Seeing Rāvaṇa hanging by the
<div n="lb"/>tail of Bāli, even the women folk laughed. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa admitted defeat. Bāli let him go unhurt.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Death.%} After Sītā had been stolen away Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa wandered about in the forest. Then
<div n="lb"/>they met with Hanumān, who took them to his King
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva. Śrī Rāma and Sugrīva entered into a treaty,
<div n="lb"/>by which Śrī Rāma was to kill Bāli and to restore to
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva his wife who was under the custody of Bāli, and
<div n="lb"/>to make him the King of Kiṣkindhā, in return for
<div n="lb"/>which Sugrīva and his men had to help Śrī Rāma to
<div n="lb"/>find out and recover Sītā. In accordance with the con-
<div n="lb"/>ditions of the treaty, Śrī Rāma and Sugrīva reached
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā, to confront with Bāli. Śrī Rāma and Sug-
<div n="lb"/>rīva had hit up on a plan, by which Śrī Rāma was to
<div n="lb"/>shoot Bāli down, when Sugrīva was engaged in boxing
<div n="lb"/>with Bāli. Sugrīva challenged Bāli to a single combat.
<div n="lb"/>Bāli came out and a horrible boxing began between the
<div n="lb"/>two. But Srī Rāma could not distinguish one from
[Page106-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the other. Thier faces were so alike. Sugrīva, being
<div n="lb"/>defeated, receded from fight. Śrī Rāma and Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ṛśyamūkācala. Surgīva spoke ill of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. But Śrī Rāma revealed the truth, and Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>believed it. Next day morning both of them started for
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā to kill Bāli. Śrī Rāma had put a flower
<div n="lb"/>garland around the neck of Sugrīva to distinguish him
<div n="lb"/>from Bāli. This time Tārā tried to the utmost to dis-
<div n="lb"/>suade Bāli from fighting. But without paying any heed
<div n="lb"/>to her words Bāli engaged Sugrīva in fighting. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, sitting in ambush, instantly sent an arrow to
<div n="lb"/>the breast of Bāli who looked to the side from which
<div n="lb"/>the arrow came. Before falling down, looking at Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma Bāli said “It is not right on the part of the King
<div n="lb"/>of Ayodhyā to have shot an arrow from ambush”.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing that Śrī Rāma said, “If you see me face to face
<div n="lb"/>you will become devoted to me. It is not right to kill
<div n="lb"/>one's devotee. You are a friend of Rāvaṇa, who as you
<div n="lb"/>know, is my foe. If I let you alone Rāvaṇa is likely to
<div n="lb"/>get your help. Besides, you have a boon that you will
<div n="lb"/>get half the strength of the foe who faces you, and as
<div n="lb"/>such you cannot be killed by anybody in direct fight.
<div n="lb"/>It is unavoidable for the safety of Sugrīva, for my
<div n="lb"/>interest, for the protection of the world at large, and
<div n="lb"/>for the preservation of law and order that you should
<div n="lb"/>be killed. Was it not a violation of duty on your part
<div n="lb"/>to steal the wife of Sugrīva?”
<div n="NI"/>Bāli fell down. Immediately Tārādevī and Aṅgada
<div n="lb"/>arrived there. Tārā spoke very harsh words to Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. At last Bāli entrusted Tārā and Aṅgada with
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma and then he died. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhākāṇḍa).
