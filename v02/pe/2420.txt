GHAṬAKARPARA¦. One of the nine great poets in
Sanskrit reputed as the nine gems in Vikramāditya's
court.
<div n="NI"/>“Dhanvantari—Kṣapaṇak Āmarasiṃha—Śaṅku—Vetāla-
bhaṭṭa—Ghaṭakarpara—Kālidāsāḥ”. A poem of twen-
ty-two verses in Sanskrit called Ghaṭakarpara kāvya is
attributed to him. The theme of the poem is a message
despatched by the hero to his wife who has only recently
been married. All the stanzas are in yamaka (repeating
a word or set of words to convey different meanings at
the end of each line). By composing a poem called
‘Nalodaya’, Kālidāsa answered the challenge posed by
Ghaṭakarpara in the use of Yamaka. Ghaṭakarpara
answered Kālidāsa in the following stanza.
<Poem>Eko hi doṣo guṇasannipāte
nimajjatīndoriti yo babhāṣe /
nūnam na dṛṣṭaṃ kavināpi tena
dāridryadoṣo guṇarāśināśī.</Poem>
(Kālidāsa, in verse 3, Canto 1 of Kumārasaṃbhava
had written ‘Eko hi doṣo guṇasannipāte nimajjatīndoḥ
kiraṇeṣvivāṅkaḥ”. In the above verse by Ghaṭakarpara
the usage ‘Kavināpi tena’ may be interpreted in two
ways, viz. Kavinā+api+tena and Kavi+nāpitena. By
the second combination Ghaṭakarpara converted Kāli-
dāsa into a barber (nāpita).
