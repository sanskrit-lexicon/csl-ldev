TUṢITAS¦. There were twelve good devas called Tuṣitas
<div n="lb"/>in the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara. When the Cākṣuṣa Man-
<div n="lb"/>vantara ended and the Vaivasvata Manvantara com-
<div n="lb"/>menced all the twelve were born as sons of Kaśyapa of
<div n="lb"/>his wife Aditi. Because they were born of Aditi they
<div n="lb"/>were called Dvādaśādityas. They were Viṣṇu etc. Thus
<div n="lb"/>the Tuṣitas of the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara were the
<div n="lb"/>Dvādaśādityas of Vaivasvata Manvantara. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
