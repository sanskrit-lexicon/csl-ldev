RUKMIṆĪ¦. The chief queen of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} From the following Purāṇic statements, it
could be understood that Rukmiṇī was the incarnation
of goddess Lakṣmī.
<div n="NI"/>(i) “Śrī Devī (Lakṣmī) by her portions, took birth in
the earth as Rukmiṇī in the family of Bhīṣmaka”.
(M.B, Ādi Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 156).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Formerly Lakṣmī Devī took birth as the daughter
of Bhṛgu by his wife Khyāti. Next she took birth from
the sea of Milk at the time of the churning of it by the
combined efforts of the devas and the asuras, to take
Amṛta (ambrosia). When Viṣṇu took birth as Āditya,
Lakṣmī took birth from lotus. When Viṣṇu incarnated
as Paraśurāma Lakṣmī Devī became the earth-goddess.
In the incarnation of Śrī Rāma she became Sītā and in
that of Śrī Kṛṣṇa she was Rukmiṇī. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Aṃśa 1, Chapter 9).
<div n="NI"/>It was in the kingdom of Vidarbha that Lakṣmī Devī
took birth as Rukmiṇī during the incarnation of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa. To Bhīṣmaka, the King of Vidarbha, five sons
beginning with Rukmī, were born. The sixth was a
daughter who was named Rukmiṇī. She grew up into
a beautiful damsel. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Rukmiṇī fell in love with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Her
parents agreed to her choice. But her brother Rukmī
was an enemy of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Rukmī desired to give his
sister to Śiśupāla. The date of the marriage was fixed
and the heart was burning within Rukmiṇī. She sent a
Brahmin as messenger to Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>The time of marriage drew near. The kings of Aṅga,
Kaliṅga, Mālava, Kekaya, Vaṅga, Magadha, Kosala,
Sālva, Cola, Pāṇḍya, Kerala and so on took their seats
in the nuptial hall. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra came
with their army. The army under the leadership of
Balabhadra remained behind and Śrī Kṛṣṇa went alone
to the nuptial hall. While preparations were being
made to give Rukmiṇī to Śiśupāla, Śrī Kṛṣṇa took her
in his chariot and quickly left the place. All the other
kings who ran after Śrī Kṛṣṇa to fight had to confront
with the mighty army of Balabhadra, who defeated the
kings and returned to Dvārakā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha
10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sons.%} It is mentioned in Bhāgavata, Skandha 10,
that ten sons were born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa by Rukmiṇī.
They were Pradyumna, Cārudeṣṇa, Sudeṣṇa, Cārudeha,
Sucāru, Cārugupta, Bhadracāru, Cārucandra, Cāru-
bhadra and Cāru. But a slight difference is observed in
the description of the sons of Rūkmiṇī given in
Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 14, Stanzas
33 and 34.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Yoked to the chariot by Durvāsas.%} See under Durvāsas,
Para 3.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Consoled Arjuna.%} After the death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
Arjuna visited Dvārakā. Seeing the dilapidated city
without rulers and the women without husbands, he
cried aloud. Rukmiṇī Devī ran to him and consoled
him and seated him on a golden chair. (M.B.
Mausala Parva, Chapter 5, Stanza 12).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Death.%} After the death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Rukmiṇī, with
the other wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa jumped into a burning pyre
and died.
<div n="NI"/>“Śaibyā, Rukmiṇī, Gāndhārī, Haimavatī and Jāmba-
[Page657-b+ 64]
vatī jumped into the fire.” (M.B. Mausala Parva,
Chapter 7, Stanza 73).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The Palace of Rukmiṇī.%} There is a statement in the
Mahābhārata, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
28, about the palace of Rukmiṇī. “Viśvakarmā built
a palace for Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the instance of Indra. The
highest dome of it is covered with gold. So this dome
dazzled as the peak of Mahāmeru. It was this dome
that was set apart for his beloved wife Rukmiṇī by Śrī
Kṛṣṇa”.
