RUKMIṆĪ¦. The chief queen of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} From the following Purāṇic statements, it
<div n="lb"/>could be understood that Rukmiṇī was the incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of goddess Lakṣmī.
<div n="NI"/>(i) “Śrī Devī (Lakṣmī) by her portions, took birth in
<div n="lb"/>the earth as Rukmiṇī in the family of Bhīṣmaka”.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B, Ādi Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 156).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Formerly Lakṣmī Devī took birth as the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Bhṛgu by his wife Khyāti. Next she took birth from
<div n="lb"/>the sea of Milk at the time of the churning of it by the
<div n="lb"/>combined efforts of the devas and the asuras, to take
<div n="lb"/>Amṛta (ambrosia). When Viṣṇu took birth as Āditya,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī took birth from lotus. When Viṣṇu incarnated
<div n="lb"/>as Paraśurāma Lakṣmī Devī became the earth-goddess.
<div n="lb"/>In the incarnation of Śrī Rāma she became Sītā and in
<div n="lb"/>that of Śrī Kṛṣṇa she was Rukmiṇī. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśa 1, Chapter 9).
<div n="NI"/>It was in the kingdom of Vidarbha that Lakṣmī Devī
<div n="lb"/>took birth as Rukmiṇī during the incarnation of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. To Bhīṣmaka, the King of Vidarbha, five sons
<div n="lb"/>beginning with Rukmī, were born. The sixth was a
<div n="lb"/>daughter who was named Rukmiṇī. She grew up into
<div n="lb"/>a beautiful damsel. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Rukmiṇī fell in love with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Her
<div n="lb"/>parents agreed to her choice. But her brother Rukmī
<div n="lb"/>was an enemy of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Rukmī desired to give his
<div n="lb"/>sister to Śiśupāla. The date of the marriage was fixed
<div n="lb"/>and the heart was burning within Rukmiṇī. She sent a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin as messenger to Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>The time of marriage drew near. The kings of Aṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga, Mālava, Kekaya, Vaṅga, Magadha, Kosala,
<div n="lb"/>Sālva, Cola, Pāṇḍya, Kerala and so on took their seats
<div n="lb"/>in the nuptial hall. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra came
<div n="lb"/>with their army. The army under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadra remained behind and Śrī Kṛṣṇa went alone
<div n="lb"/>to the nuptial hall. While preparations were being
<div n="lb"/>made to give Rukmiṇī to Śiśupāla, Śrī Kṛṣṇa took her
<div n="lb"/>in his chariot and quickly left the place. All the other
<div n="lb"/>kings who ran after Śrī Kṛṣṇa to fight had to confront
<div n="lb"/>with the mighty army of Balabhadra, who defeated the
<div n="lb"/>kings and returned to Dvārakā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha
<div n="lb"/>10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sons.%} It is mentioned in Bhāgavata, Skandha 10,
<div n="lb"/>that ten sons were born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa by Rukmiṇī.
<div n="lb"/>They were Pradyumna, Cārudeṣṇa, Sudeṣṇa, Cārudeha,
<div n="lb"/>Sucāru, Cārugupta, Bhadracāru, Cārucandra, Cāru-
<div n="lb"/>bhadra and Cāru. But a slight difference is observed in
<div n="lb"/>the description of the sons of Rūkmiṇī given in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 14, Stanzas
<div n="lb"/>33 and 34.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Yoked to the chariot by Durvāsas.%} See under Durvāsas,
<div n="lb"/>Para 3.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Consoled Arjuna.%} After the death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna visited Dvārakā. Seeing the dilapidated city
<div n="lb"/>without rulers and the women without husbands, he
<div n="lb"/>cried aloud. Rukmiṇī Devī ran to him and consoled
<div n="lb"/>him and seated him on a golden chair. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Mausala Parva, Chapter 5, Stanza 12).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Death.%} After the death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Rukmiṇī, with
<div n="lb"/>the other wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa jumped into a burning pyre
<div n="lb"/>and died.
<div n="NI"/>“Śaibyā, Rukmiṇī, Gāndhārī, Haimavatī and Jāmba-
[Page657-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>vatī jumped into the fire.” (M.B. Mausala Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 7, Stanza 73).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The Palace of Rukmiṇī.%} There is a statement in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>28, about the palace of Rukmiṇī. “Viśvakarmā built
<div n="lb"/>a palace for Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the instance of Indra. The
<div n="lb"/>highest dome of it is covered with gold. So this dome
<div n="lb"/>dazzled as the peak of Mahāmeru. It was this dome
<div n="lb"/>that was set apart for his beloved wife Rukmiṇī by Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa”.
