AGASTYA¦ TĪRTHA. This is one of the five tīrthas or
<div n="lb"/>sacred places of worship lying scattered in the southern
<div n="lb"/>ocean. The other four are the following: (1) The
<div n="lb"/>Saubhadra tīrtha (2) The Pauloma tīrtha (3) The
<div n="lb"/>Kārandhama tīrtha and (4) the Atipāvana tīrtha.
<div n="lb"/>These five were known as Pañca tīrthas and many saints
<div n="lb"/>used to live there. There lived in each of these tīrthas
<div n="lb"/>one huge and fierce crocodile and all the saints living
<div n="lb"/>there, afraid of these crocodiles, deserted their places
<div n="lb"/>one by one. (Ref: Śloka 3, Chapter 220 of Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B. For more details see under Pañca tīrtha).
