AGASTYA¦ TĪRTHA. This is one of the five tīrthas or
sacred places of worship lying scattered in the southern
ocean. The other four are the following: (1) The
Saubhadra tīrtha (2) The Pauloma tīrtha (3) The
Kārandhama tīrtha and (4) the Atipāvana tīrtha.
These five were known as Pañca tīrthas and many saints
used to live there. There lived in each of these tīrthas
one huge and fierce crocodile and all the saints living
there, afraid of these crocodiles, deserted their places
one by one. (Ref: Śloka 3, Chapter 220 of Ādi Parva,
M.B. For more details see under Pañca tīrtha).
