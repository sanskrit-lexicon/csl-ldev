MAHĀŚAṄKHA I¦. A crocodile celebrated in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas. He had a wife named Śaṅkhinī. The seven
<div n="lb"/>children born to Śaṅkhinī became the Maruts in the
<div n="lb"/>Svārociṣa Manvantara. There is a story in Chapter 72,
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana Purāṇa about these children who became
<div n="lb"/>Maruts.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtadhvaja, son of Svārociṣa Manu had seven heroic
<div n="lb"/>sons. They went to Mahāmeru and began to worship
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā for gaining Indra's place. Indra was alarmed.
<div n="lb"/>He sent the Apsarā woman Pūtanā to the sons of Ṛta-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja to obstruct their tapas. There was a river flowing
<div n="lb"/>by the side of their āśrama. Ṛtadhvaja's sons came to
<div n="lb"/>the river to take their bath. Just at that time, Pūtanā
<div n="lb"/>also came there and began to take bath. At her sight,
<div n="lb"/>the young men had an involuntary emission of semen.
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkhinī, wife of the crocodile Mahāśaṅkha swallowed
<div n="lb"/>it. The princes whose tapas was interrupted returned
<div n="lb"/>to the palace. Pūtanā returned to Indra and reported
<div n="lb"/>the matter.
<div n="NI"/>After some years, Śaṅkhinī happened to be caught in
<div n="lb"/>a fisherman's net. The fisherman caught her and inform-
<div n="lb"/>ed Ṛtadhvaja's sons about his catch. They took her to
<div n="lb"/>the palace and put her in a tank there. In due course
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkhinī gave birth to seven children. Immediately
<div n="lb"/>after that she attained mokṣa. The children began to cry
<div n="lb"/>for mother's milk, moving about in the water. Then
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appeared to them and told them not to cry
<div n="lb"/>and assured them that they would become the Devas of
<div n="lb"/>“Vāyu Skandha”. He took them up to the sky and put
<div n="lb"/>them in Vāyuskandha. These children were the Maruts
<div n="lb"/>of the Svārociṣa Manvantara.
