KRODHAVAŚĀ¦. Wife of Prajāpati Kaśyapa. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Sarga 14). The Asuras who
were born to Krodhavaśā are also called Krodhavaśas.
Most of these Krodhavaśas were employed to guard the
lotus-lake of Kubera. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 154).
Bhīmasena once entered the lotus-lake of Kubera and
plucked the “Saugandhika” flower. The Krodhavaśas
[Page418-b+ 64]
ran to Kubera to inform him of this theft. It is stated
in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 285, Stanza 2
that these Krodhavaśas were present in the army of
Rāvaṇa.
