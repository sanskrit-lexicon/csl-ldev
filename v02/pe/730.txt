ĀNANDA¦ (CĀKṢUṢA). Son of Maharṣi Anamitra. It
<div n="lb"/>was he who was born as Cākṣuṣa, the sixth Manu.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story behind his birth. One day, while his
<div n="lb"/>mother was keeping him in her lap and caressing him
<div n="lb"/>the baby laughed and questioned “Oh mother why are
<div n="lb"/>you caressing me, but look at those two cats. They
<div n="lb"/>consider me as their food”. After some time one of the
<div n="lb"/>cats took the child away and put it in the cradle of the
<div n="lb"/>child of King Vikrānta. Vikrānta took the child as his
<div n="lb"/>for granted and reared him. At the time of Upanayana
<div n="lb"/>the King asked the boy to prostrate before his mother at
<div n="lb"/>which the boy exclaimed “Oh King, I am not your son.
<div n="lb"/>Your son is at some other place. By births and rebirths
<div n="lb"/>all of us have many mothers and so it is better to be
<div n="lb"/>above rebirths”. After having said so much Ānanda
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest and started doing penance. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and blessing him said that he
<div n="lb"/>would become the sixth Manu and lead the world to
<div n="lb"/>righteousness. By the blessing of Brahmā Ānanda was
<div n="lb"/>reborn as Cākṣuṣamanu. (See under Cākṣuṣa). (Mār-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇḍeya Purāṇa).
