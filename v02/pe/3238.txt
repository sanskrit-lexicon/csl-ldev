KAṆIKA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} One of the ministers of
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra. He was a brahmin well-learned in
<div n="lb"/>Kūṭanīti (Diplomacy). The bad advice he gave to
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra became well-known as “Kaṇika's Kūṭa-
<div n="lb"/>nīti”.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kaṇika's Kūṭanīti.%} Once Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Kaṇika
<div n="lb"/>how to conquer one's enemies by using the four
<div n="lb"/>methods of Sāma, Dāna, Bheda and Daṇḍa. Kaṇika
<div n="lb"/>replied: “Threaten the timid ones. Give respect to
<div n="lb"/>the brave and kill them by trickery. Give gifts to the
<div n="lb"/>greedy ones. If any one becomes your enemy kill him
<div n="lb"/>even if it be your father, preceptor, son, brother or
<div n="lb"/>friend. Never speak insulting words about others even
<div n="lb"/>when you are extremely angry. Never believe the
<div n="lb"/>faithful and unfaithful alike.”
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaṇika's story.%} Kaṇika justified his policy by means
<div n="lb"/>of the story of a fox who put into practice the four
<div n="lb"/>tricks to gain his end.
<div n="NI"/>Once there was a very selfish fox in a forest. He felt a
<div n="lb"/>desire to eat the flesh of a lion. For that end he made
<div n="lb"/>friends with a tiger, a rat and a mongoose. The fox
<div n="lb"/>advised the rat to gnaw the paws of the lion and make
<div n="lb"/>it lame. The tiger should then kill the lion. The lion
<div n="lb"/>was killed and the fox suggested that they could have
<div n="lb"/>a hearty meal of the lion after a bath. Everybody
[Page385-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>excepting the fox went for his bath and the fox stood
<div n="lb"/>watch over the carcass of the lion. First came the tiger
<div n="lb"/>after his bath. The fox looked worried and the tiger
<div n="lb"/>asked him the reason why. The fox said “Comrade,
<div n="lb"/>the rat says with arrogance that he it was that killed the
<div n="lb"/>lion. My pride does not allow me to eat what the rat
<div n="lb"/>claims to be his kill.” Hearing this the proud tiger
<div n="lb"/>left the place saying “Let me see whether I can kill
<div n="lb"/>my prey without the help of anybody.”
<div n="NI"/>Sometime later the rat came after its bath. The sly
<div n="lb"/>fox said “My friend, the mongoose says that the flesh
<div n="lb"/>of a lion is poison. It says “Let the rat eat it and die.”
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this the rat went its way.
<div n="NI"/>Then came the mongoose. The fox threatened it and it
<div n="lb"/>went away. The fox then ate the flesh of the lion by
<div n="lb"/>himself and was contented.
<div n="NI"/>Kaṇika then said that the Kings should use such tricks
<div n="lb"/>against their enemies. (Chapter 139, Ādi Parva).
