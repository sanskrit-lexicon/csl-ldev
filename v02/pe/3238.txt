KAṆIKA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} One of the ministers of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra. He was a brahmin well-learned in
Kūṭanīti (Diplomacy). The bad advice he gave to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra became well-known as “Kaṇika's Kūṭa-
nīti”.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kaṇika's Kūṭanīti.%} Once Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Kaṇika
how to conquer one's enemies by using the four
methods of Sāma, Dāna, Bheda and Daṇḍa. Kaṇika
replied: “Threaten the timid ones. Give respect to
the brave and kill them by trickery. Give gifts to the
greedy ones. If any one becomes your enemy kill him
even if it be your father, preceptor, son, brother or
friend. Never speak insulting words about others even
when you are extremely angry. Never believe the
faithful and unfaithful alike.”
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaṇika's story.%} Kaṇika justified his policy by means
of the story of a fox who put into practice the four
tricks to gain his end.
<div n="NI"/>Once there was a very selfish fox in a forest. He felt a
desire to eat the flesh of a lion. For that end he made
friends with a tiger, a rat and a mongoose. The fox
advised the rat to gnaw the paws of the lion and make
it lame. The tiger should then kill the lion. The lion
was killed and the fox suggested that they could have
a hearty meal of the lion after a bath. Everybody
[Page385-a+ 63]
excepting the fox went for his bath and the fox stood
watch over the carcass of the lion. First came the tiger
after his bath. The fox looked worried and the tiger
asked him the reason why. The fox said “Comrade,
the rat says with arrogance that he it was that killed the
lion. My pride does not allow me to eat what the rat
claims to be his kill.” Hearing this the proud tiger
left the place saying “Let me see whether I can kill
my prey without the help of anybody.”
<div n="NI"/>Sometime later the rat came after its bath. The sly
fox said “My friend, the mongoose says that the flesh
of a lion is poison. It says “Let the rat eat it and die.”
Hearing this the rat went its way.
<div n="NI"/>Then came the mongoose. The fox threatened it and it
went away. The fox then ate the flesh of the lion by
himself and was contented.
<div n="NI"/>Kaṇika then said that the Kings should use such tricks
against their enemies. (Chapter 139, Ādi Parva).
