BṚHADAŚVA I¦. An ancient hermit. He had much res-
pect for Dharmaputra. It is stated in the Mahābhārata,
Vana Parva, Chapter 52, that Bṛhadaśva went to the
forest Kāmyaka with Dharmaputra. Bṛhadaśva narra-
ted the story ‘Nalopākhyāna’ to Dharmaputra in
order to divert his mind from the thought of the loss
of his kingdom. When he had finished the story he
taught Dharmaputra, the two important spells, Akṣa-
hṛdaya and Aśvaśiras.
