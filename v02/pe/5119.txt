sūya conducted by Dharmaputra. During the big battle
the Pauṇḍras fought against the Kauravas constructing
a Krauñcavyūha (a battle array in the shape of a
stork). (Chapter 50, Bhīṣma Parva). Kṛṣṇa and Karṇa
on two different occasions conquered this country.

into Śūdras. (Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva).
