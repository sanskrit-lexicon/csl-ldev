MUDGALA III¦. (MAUDGALYA). A sage of Purāṇic
<div n="lb"/>fame.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Mudgala and Durvāsas.%} Mudgala had never been
<div n="lb"/>provoked even once by anger. Durvāsas once came to
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama of Mudgala in Kurukṣetra where he was
<div n="lb"/>living on alms received by begging. Durvāsas came
<div n="lb"/>naked. Mudgala gave all that he got that day to
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas. The latter ate to his heart's content and
<div n="lb"/>smeared on his naked body what remained after his
<div n="lb"/>meal. Mudgala never got angry. This continued for
<div n="lb"/>days together and not for once did Mudgala get angry.
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas was immensely pleased with this behaviour
<div n="lb"/>of Mudgala and he offered to send him to heaven with
<div n="lb"/>his body. Devas came with a Vimāna at once.
<div n="lb"/>Mudgala after enquiring about the conveniences and
<div n="lb"/>luxuries of heaven refused to go. (Chapter 261, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
