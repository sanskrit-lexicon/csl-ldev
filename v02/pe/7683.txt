UGRARAVAS¦. A muni. He killed one Duṣpaṇya (Setu-
māhātmya). Duṣpaṇya was the last son of a merchant
in Pāṭalīputra. He killed many children for sport and
his father sent him away. He went to the forest and
there drowned to death a muni called Ugraravas, who
was engaged in tapas. Ugraravas cursed him to death
by drowning and his soul to wander about as a devil.
The curse came true. (Setumāhātmya).
