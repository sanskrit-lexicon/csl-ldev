PŪRVĀŚRAMA¦. A sacred place on the shores of the
river Sarayū. While going along the shores of this
river with Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, Viśvāmitra showed the
boys this āśrama and explained to them its importance.
It was at this place that Śiva burnt Kāmadeva (god of
love) to death. Kāmadeva got the name Anaṅga at
this place. (Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sarga
23).
