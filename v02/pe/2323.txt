GĀNDHĀRĪ¦. Wife of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} There was a King called Subala in the family
of Turvasu, brother of Yadu. (For genealogy see under
Subala). Subala became the King of the land of Gān-
dhāra. This land extended from the river Sindhu to
Kābul. Gāndhārī was the daughter of Subala. (Chap-
ter 111, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Gāndhārī became a devotee of Śiva even
from her childhood. Śiva became pleased with her and
blessed her saying that she would bear a hundred sons.
Bhīṣma came to know of this and he planned to get her
married to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. One day he sent a messenger
to Subala making a proposal. Subala knew that Dhṛ-
tarāṣṭra was born blind but considering his lineage and
the powerful alliance it would make, consented to the
proposal of Bhīṣma. Śakuni, brother of Gāndhārī, then
by the order of his father took Gāndhārī to Hastinā-
pura and Dhṛtarāṣṭra accepted her as his wife. Gān-
dhārī obeying his father's instructions without a demur
accepted her blind husband with such devotion that
she made herself blind by tightly covering her eyes
with a silk shawl. (Chapter 110, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth of Sons.%} Once Vyāsa came to her exhausted
with hunger and thirst. Gāndhārī appeased his hunger
and thirst with tasty things to eat and drink. Vyāsa
was immensely pleased and he also blessed her and
said she would get a hundred sons. Very soon she be-
came pregnant. But even after two years she did not
deliver, while Kuntī, wife of Pāṇḍu, gave birth to a
son. Grief-stricken, she hit hardly on her womb secretly
and then a great mass of flesh came out. Then Vyāsa
appeared before her and advised her to cut the lump
of flesh into a hundred pieces and deposit one each in
a jar of ghee. Vyāsa himself cut it into pieces. Gān-
dhārī expressed a desire to have a girl also. Vyāsa cut
it into hundred and one pieces and put them in hundred
[Page275-a+ 65]
and one jars of ghee. In due time the jars broke and
a hundred sons and a daughter came out of the jars.
The daughter was named Duśśalā. For their name see
‘Kauravas’. Dhṛtarāṣṭra got another son named Yuyu-
tsu. (Chapters 115 and 116, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gāndharī faints.%} When Sañjaya reported about the
death of Karṇa at the battle both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
Gāndhārī fainted. (Śloka 55, Chapter 96, Karṇa
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Gāndhārī starts to curse the Pāṇḍavas.%} When the battle
was over the sons of Gāndhārī and their followers were
killed. Dhṛtarāṣṭra suggested that the Pāṇḍavas should
visit Gāndhārī and pay homage to her. The Pāṇḍavas,
therefore, went and stood before Gāndhārī very res-
pectfully. Vengeance boiled in her heart and her body
shivered. Gāndhārī was about to curse the Pāṇḍavas
when Vyāsa, intervened saying “Gāndhārī! Don't you
remember you said that victory would lie on the side
of the righteous in this war? Your words are not wasted.
The Pāṇḍavas won the battle because right was on
their side. So why should you get agitated?” Gāndhārī
became calm on hearing these words and she admitted
that the end of the Kuru dynasty came because of the
mistakes of Duryodhana, Śakuni, Karṇa and Duśśā-
sana. She, thereafter, treated the Pāṇḍavas as her own
sons. (Chapter 14, Strī Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Dharmaputra's foot-nails become blue.%} Following the
instructions of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the Pāṇḍavas, approached
and bowed before Gāndhārī. She covered her face
with a cloth and wept, tears rolling down her cheeks.
When Dharmaputra bent to touch her feet the latter
saw through the veil on her face the foot-nails of
Dharmaputra. A few drops of the lachrymal water fell
on the foot-nails of Dharmaputra making them turn
blue instantly. (Chapter 15, Strī Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Gāndhārī curses Kṛṣṇa.%} At the end of the battle the
aggrieved Gāndhārī went to Kurukṣetra together with
Kṛṣṇa and other relatives. Seeing mighty Kings on the
Kaurava side lying dead like huge trees lying truncated
Gāndhārī burst into tears. She knew that Śrī Kṛṣṇa
was at the root of all this. Embittered she looked at
Kṛṣṇa and cursed him. “Ho, Kṛṣṇa, thirtysix years
from this day you will lose your sons, ministers, friends
and relatives. You will become a lone walker in the
forests and be killed by trickery.”
<div n="NI"/>It was because of this curse that the Yādava tribe perish-
ed and Kṛṣṇa was struck by the arrow of a hunter
which made him end his life on earth.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The end of Gāndhārī.%} After the great Kurukṣetra battle
heart-broken Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī accompanied
by Kuntī, Vidura and Sañjaya went to the forests to
spend the rest of their life there. Many people and the
Pāṇḍavas accompanied them up to the river Gaṅgā and
there near the āśrama of Śatayūpa Dhṛtarāṣṭra made
a hut and lived with Gāndhārī and Kuntī.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas felt the separation of their relatives
unbearable and lived in grief. After six years one day
Dharmaputra saw his mother, Kuntī, in a dream. He
told his brothers about this and they all felt a desire
to go to the forest and see their mother. The next day they
reached the shores of Gaṅgā. Vyāsa also joined them.
Gāndhārī and Kuntī expressed a desire to Vyāsa that
they would like to see the dead sons and relatives once
again. Vyāsa then asked them to go and take a dip
in the river. When they rose up after a dip they saw
[Page275-b+ 65]
standing on the shores of the river the great warriors
Karṇa and Duryodhana and others. By the yogic power
of Vyāsa even the blind Dhṛtarāṣṭra could get the vision.
Very soon the vision faded and the Pāṇḍavas returned
to Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>Two days after, fire broke out in the forest where
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was staying. Dhṛtarāṣtra, Kuntī and
Gāndhārī were burnt to death in that fire. (Chapter 32,
Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%After the death.%} Dharmaputra performed the obsequi-
es of those who died in the wild fire (Āśramavāsika
Parva, Chapter 30). Leaving the mortal bodies the souls of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī entered Kuberaloka. (Śloka
14, Chapter 5, Svargārohaṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Synonyms of Gāndhārī.%} The following words have
been used in the Mahābhārata to denote Gāndhārī;
Gāndhārarājaduhitā, Saubaleyī, Saubalī, Subalajā,
Subalāputrī and Subalātmajā.
