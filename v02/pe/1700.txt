DAṂBHODBHAVA¦. An ancient emperor. He was a
<div n="lb"/>mighty warrior prince. He brought the whole world
<div n="lb"/>under control. At last there was nobody left to fight
<div n="lb"/>with. So he walked about challenging everybody he met
<div n="lb"/>with. But none dared to fight with him. Then Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>advised him to challenge Nara Nārāyaṇas who were
<div n="lb"/>doing penance on the northern-most point of the earth.
<div n="lb"/>So the emperor went with his mighty army to Gandha-
<div n="lb"/>mādana and informed Nara and Nārāyaṇa of his desire
<div n="lb"/>to fight. They said that they were mere hermits and
<div n="lb"/>that they had no power to fight. But Daṃbhodbhava was
<div n="lb"/>not satisfied. Finally Nara and Nārāyaṇa took some
<div n="lb"/>iṣīkā grass and began to fight the emperor with it.
<div n="lb"/>Though the army of the emperor was mighty and vast
<div n="lb"/>it could not stand against the grass in the hands of the
[Page199-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>hermits. Finally the emperor admitted failure and
<div n="lb"/>bowed before the hermits. They advised him not to be
<div n="lb"/>arrogant in future and to lead a pure life. Hearing the
<div n="lb"/>exhortations of the hermits the emperor became a
<div n="lb"/>devoted man. He returned to his palace and led a life
<div n="lb"/>of righteousness. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 96).
