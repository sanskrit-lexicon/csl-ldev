DAṂBHODBHAVA¦. An ancient emperor. He was a
mighty warrior prince. He brought the whole world
under control. At last there was nobody left to fight
with. So he walked about challenging everybody he met
with. But none dared to fight with him. Then Brahmā
advised him to challenge Nara Nārāyaṇas who were
doing penance on the northern-most point of the earth.
So the emperor went with his mighty army to Gandha-
mādana and informed Nara and Nārāyaṇa of his desire
to fight. They said that they were mere hermits and
that they had no power to fight. But Daṃbhodbhava was
not satisfied. Finally Nara and Nārāyaṇa took some
iṣīkā grass and began to fight the emperor with it.
Though the army of the emperor was mighty and vast
it could not stand against the grass in the hands of the
[Page199-b+ 65]
hermits. Finally the emperor admitted failure and
bowed before the hermits. They advised him not to be
arrogant in future and to lead a pure life. Hearing the
exhortations of the hermits the emperor became a
devoted man. He returned to his palace and led a life
of righteousness. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 96).
