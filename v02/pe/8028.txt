VARATANU¦. A King of the Kurus. Because of his sin-
ful deeds in the previous birth he was denied the happi-
ness of getting children in the next birth. In the rebirth
his name was Śrīdhara. He lived with his wife Prabhā-
vatī for a long time, but did not get children. When
the hermit Vyāsa came to his palace once, the King
[Page831-a+ 65]
asked him for the reason of his remaining childless.
Vyāsa replied “Oh King, hear why you have only
one wife and why you do not get children. In the
previous birth you had been a brahmin named Vara-
tanu. Your wife was called Śaṅkarī. When both of you
were going somewhere once, you happened to see a low-
caste child falling into water. Without paying any heed
to it, you went on your way. The child was drowned.
Though both of you have taken births in royal families
due to the several good deeds of yours, you have become
childless because of that one sinful act.”
<div n="NI"/>According to the instruction of Vyāsa, he gave Brah-
mins alms of gold, clothes, oxen, pumpkin etc. and
performed Bāla vrata, the rite for the sake of children.
Thus he got remission of his sin. Within a year he got
a son loved and respected by everyone. That handsome
prince became an emperor who came to be the founder
of a dynasty. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Khaṇḍa, Chap-
ter 6).
