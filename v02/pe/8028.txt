VARATANU¦. A King of the Kurus. Because of his sin-
<div n="lb"/>ful deeds in the previous birth he was denied the happi-
<div n="lb"/>ness of getting children in the next birth. In the rebirth
<div n="lb"/>his name was Śrīdhara. He lived with his wife Prabhā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī for a long time, but did not get children. When
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Vyāsa came to his palace once, the King
[Page831-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>asked him for the reason of his remaining childless.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa replied “Oh King, hear why you have only
<div n="lb"/>one wife and why you do not get children. In the
<div n="lb"/>previous birth you had been a brahmin named Vara-
<div n="lb"/>tanu. Your wife was called Śaṅkarī. When both of you
<div n="lb"/>were going somewhere once, you happened to see a low-
<div n="lb"/>caste child falling into water. Without paying any heed
<div n="lb"/>to it, you went on your way. The child was drowned.
<div n="lb"/>Though both of you have taken births in royal families
<div n="lb"/>due to the several good deeds of yours, you have become
<div n="lb"/>childless because of that one sinful act.”
<div n="NI"/>According to the instruction of Vyāsa, he gave Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mins alms of gold, clothes, oxen, pumpkin etc. and
<div n="lb"/>performed Bāla vrata, the rite for the sake of children.
<div n="lb"/>Thus he got remission of his sin. Within a year he got
<div n="lb"/>a son loved and respected by everyone. That handsome
<div n="lb"/>prince became an emperor who came to be the founder
<div n="lb"/>of a dynasty. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Khaṇḍa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 6).
