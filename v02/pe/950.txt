BAṬU¦ (VAṬU). A brahmin who reads the Gītā daily.
<div n="lb"/>Because in life he held fast to duty he was carried to
<div n="lb"/>heaven after death. The dead body was eaten away
<div n="lb"/>by birds and the bony skeleton remained. When rains
<div n="lb"/>started the empty skull was filled with water and a
<div n="lb"/>sinner passing that way touched the skull and the sinner
<div n="lb"/>got salvation. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa).
