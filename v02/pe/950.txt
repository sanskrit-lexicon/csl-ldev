BAṬU¦ (VAṬU). A brahmin who reads the Gītā daily.
Because in life he held fast to duty he was carried to
heaven after death. The dead body was eaten away
by birds and the bony skeleton remained. When rains
started the empty skull was filled with water and a
sinner passing that way touched the skull and the sinner
got salvation. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa).
