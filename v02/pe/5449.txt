PṚTHVĪRŪPA¦. A beautiful king of a country called
<div n="lb"/>Pratiṣṭhāna. Once three wise yogins came to him and
<div n="lb"/>said “Oh King, we have travelled round the world.
<div n="lb"/>There is a princess in Muktidvīpa called Rūpalatā. In
<div n="lb"/>beauty she will be a good match for you.” On hearing
<div n="lb"/>this Pṛthvīrūpa calling the court artist Kumāradatta to
<div n="lb"/>his side said “Paint a picture of mine and go along with
[Page611-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>these three sannyāsins to Muktidvīpa and give the
<div n="lb"/>painting in private to the princess there and also bring
<div n="lb"/>me an exact painting of hers.”
<div n="NI"/>The painter went to Muktidvīpa and the King coming
<div n="lb"/>to know of the talents of the artist Kumāradatta com-
<div n="lb"/>missioned him to paint a picture of his daughter
<div n="lb"/>Rūpalatā. He did the work beautifully. The King was
<div n="lb"/>immensely pleased and he enquired if Kumāradatta
<div n="lb"/>had seen a suitable prince for Rūpalatā. Kumāradatta
<div n="lb"/>immediately showed him the portrait of Pṛthvīrūpa.
<div n="lb"/>The king found the prince extremely suitable and en-
<div n="lb"/>trusted the artist himself with the task of negotiating the
<div n="lb"/>marriage with Pṛthvīrūpa. Kumāradatta returned to
<div n="lb"/>his King with the portrait of Rūpalatā and Pṛthvīrūpa
<div n="lb"/>was infatuated with the dazzling beauty of Rūpalatā.
<div n="lb"/>Before long the marriage of Pṛthvīrūpa with Rūpalatā
<div n="lb"/>was conducted in all grandeur. (Alaṅkāravatīlambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara, Taraṅga 1).
