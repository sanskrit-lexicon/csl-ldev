PṚTHVĪRŪPA¦. A beautiful king of a country called
Pratiṣṭhāna. Once three wise yogins came to him and
said “Oh King, we have travelled round the world.
There is a princess in Muktidvīpa called Rūpalatā. In
beauty she will be a good match for you.” On hearing
this Pṛthvīrūpa calling the court artist Kumāradatta to
his side said “Paint a picture of mine and go along with
[Page611-a+ 64]
these three sannyāsins to Muktidvīpa and give the
painting in private to the princess there and also bring
me an exact painting of hers.”
<div n="NI"/>The painter went to Muktidvīpa and the King coming
to know of the talents of the artist Kumāradatta com-
missioned him to paint a picture of his daughter
Rūpalatā. He did the work beautifully. The King was
immensely pleased and he enquired if Kumāradatta
had seen a suitable prince for Rūpalatā. Kumāradatta
immediately showed him the portrait of Pṛthvīrūpa.
The king found the prince extremely suitable and en-
trusted the artist himself with the task of negotiating the
marriage with Pṛthvīrūpa. Kumāradatta returned to
his King with the portrait of Rūpalatā and Pṛthvīrūpa
was infatuated with the dazzling beauty of Rūpalatā.
Before long the marriage of Pṛthvīrūpa with Rūpalatā
was conducted in all grandeur. (Alaṅkāravatīlambaka,
Kathāsaritsāgara, Taraṅga 1).
