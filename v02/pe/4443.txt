MĀTARIŚVAN¦. A devatā (demigod). There are
several stories in the Vedas regarding the birth of Agni
(fire). Though Agni originating from the clouds rea-
ches the earth as lightning it hides itself making it invisi-
ble to man. It was Mātariśvan who took its form from
the earth and gave it to the Bhṛgu family and made it
possible for them to make it as and when it was requir-
ed. (Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>This Mātariśvan was one of the prominent sons of
Garuḍa. (Śloka 14, Chapter 10, Udyoga Parva).
