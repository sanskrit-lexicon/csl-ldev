<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Bṛhaspati once approached, on the crest of
<div n="lb"/>a wave of lust, Mamatā, his brother's wife who was
<div n="lb"/>pregnant then. The child from the mother's womb said
<div n="lb"/>‘no’ to the move. But, Bṛhaspati cursed the child and
<div n="lb"/>had his own way with Mamatā. Thus two children
<div n="lb"/>developed in her womb. Just after delivering the child-
<div n="lb"/>ren the mother went away leaving the child by Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati behind. The Devas took charge of the forsaken
<div n="lb"/>child and named him Bharadvāja. Ultimately they
<div n="lb"/>handed over the child (Bharadvāja) to king Bharata,
<div n="lb"/>the famous son of Duṣyanta. Children had already been
<div n="lb"/>born to Bharata by his three wives, but as all of them
<div n="lb"/>were found to be immoral the mothers themselves killed
<div n="lb"/>them. It was at such a juncture that Bharata got Bha-
<div n="lb"/>radvāja as adopted son. (Bharadvāja is known by
<div n="lb"/>another name also, Vitatha). From Vitatha was born
<div n="lb"/>Manyu, from Manyu Bṛhatkṣetra from Bṛhatkṣetra
<div n="lb"/>Jaya and from Jaya Garga. The famous Rantideva
<div n="lb"/>was the grandson of Nara. (the brother of Garga) and
<div n="lb"/>son of Saṃkṛti. A son called Śani was born to Garga
<div n="lb"/>after which he took to Sannyāsa. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Chapters 20 and 21).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Yādavaguru.%} In course of time Garga became precep-
<div n="lb"/>tor of the Yādavas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma who
<div n="lb"/>had returned to Mathurā from Ambādi were sent to
<div n="lb"/>sage Sandīpani in obedience to the advice of Garga.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Garga and Mucukunda.%} Garga once visited Mucukunda,
<div n="lb"/>son of Māndhātā at his palace, and very much pleased
<div n="lb"/>with the devoted reception accorded to him blessed
<div n="lb"/>Mucukunda that one day he would see Śrī Kṛṣṇa in
<div n="lb"/>person. It was according to this blessing that Mucu-
<div n="lb"/>kunda, while asleep once in a cave had a sight of Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Mucukunda).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Importance of Garga.%} A number of reputed sage
<div n="lb"/>visited Śrī Rāma on his return to Ayodhyā from the
<div n="lb"/>forest. Amongst them were present Kauśika, Yavakrīta,
<div n="lb"/>Raibhya, Kaṇva and Garga with their numerous disci-
<div n="lb"/>ples. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Garga, a scholar in astronomy.%} There is a place called
<div n="lb"/>Gargasrota on the banks of river Sarasvatī. Garga did
<div n="lb"/>tapas here and discovered some principles of astronomy
<div n="lb"/>such as the path of planets, stars etc. He was also the
<div n="lb"/>chief astronomer in the assembly of emperor Pṛthu.
<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 111).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other information.%} (1) While the great war was
<div n="lb"/>raging Garga visited Kurukṣetra and advised Droṇa to
<div n="lb"/>end the war. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 19).
<div n="NI"/>(2) He advised King Viśvāvasu about eternity. (Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 318, Verse 49).
<div n="NI"/>(3) He spoke about the greatness of the world (Viś-
<div n="lb"/>vamahimā) to Yudhiṣṭhira. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 18).
