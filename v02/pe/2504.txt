GRAHAPĪḌĀ¦. (Adverse planetary effects on children)
Astrologers hold the view that planets affect or exercise
some influence on the lives of people. According to
that given hereunder is a brief description of planets,
which affect a child from its very birth as also of
remedial measures to keep the child free from such
adverse planetary effects.
<div n="NI"/>On the very day of the birth of the child a female
planet called Pāpinī affects it as a result of which it will
refuse all food and be lying turning its head this way
and that. Pāpinī will tap the health not only of the
child but of the mother also. Bali (sacrificial offering
with flesh, fish and liquor as also waving with flowers and
fragrant materials and lighted lamp, and smearing the
child's body with sandal paste, mancetti powder, tātiri
flower, bark of pachotti, are remedies against the attack
of Pāpinī. Burning of buffalo dung also is useful.
<div n="NI"/>On the second night after the birth of the child another
female planet called Bhīṣaṇī attacks it. Symptoms of
the attack are coughing, deep breath and shrinking of
bodily organs. The remedies for the attack are: smearing
of the body with paste made in sheep's urine of tippalī
(long pepper), rāmacca, root of “Kaṭalāṭi” and sandal-

got by burning the horn tooth and hairs of the cow.
And, with the above-mentioned things bali should be
offered to the planet.
