<div n="lb"/>some influence on the lives of people. According to
<div n="lb"/>that given hereunder is a brief description of planets,
<div n="lb"/>which affect a child from its very birth as also of
<div n="lb"/>remedial measures to keep the child free from such
<div n="lb"/>adverse planetary effects.
<div n="NI"/>On the very day of the birth of the child a female
<div n="lb"/>planet called Pāpinī affects it as a result of which it will
<div n="lb"/>refuse all food and be lying turning its head this way
<div n="lb"/>and that. Pāpinī will tap the health not only of the
<div n="lb"/>child but of the mother also. Bali (sacrificial offering
<div n="lb"/>with flesh, fish and liquor as also waving with flowers and
<div n="lb"/>fragrant materials and lighted lamp, and smearing the
<div n="lb"/>child's body with sandal paste, mancetti powder, tātiri
<div n="lb"/>flower, bark of pachotti, are remedies against the attack
<div n="lb"/>of Pāpinī. Burning of buffalo dung also is useful.
