MAYIL¦ (PEACOCK). In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa there is
a story about how the peacock got its beauty. Mayil in
Malayālam means peacock.
<div n="NI"/>Once Rāvaṇa set out in his Puṣpaka Vimāna with his
army of Rākṣasas, determined to gain victory over all
Kings. They got down on the mountain called Uśīravīra.
Rāvaṇa examined the valley to see whether there were
any Kings doing tapas anywhere there. A King named
Marutta was performing a yāga called “Māheśvara” in
an āśrama. Indra and other gods were also present to
receive the share of offerings (Havirbhāga). At the sight
of Rāvaṇa, the gods took different disguises and fled
in panic. At that time Indra assumed the form of a big
peacock. As soon as Rāvaṇa left the place, the gods re-
assembled there. From that time, Indra who put on the
disguise of a peacock felt a special attachment to that
bird. He called the peacock and said:—“Till now you
were blue in colour. But from today onwards, your
feathers will have various colours. All my thousand eyes

I transfer to you Besides, you will be immune from all
diseases. Whoever kills you, will meet with death, soon
after. You will dance at the commencement of the rainy
season. People will greet you with enthusiasm.”
<div n="NI"/>It is because of Indra's blessing that Peacocks are so
beautiful in appearance and dance at the onset of the
rainy season.
