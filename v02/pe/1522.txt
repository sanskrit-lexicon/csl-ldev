CERIPPU¦. (FOOTWEAR). There is a story in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata of how Cerippu and Kuṭa (footwear and
<div n="lb"/>umbrella) were born. Once the heat of the Sun be-
<div n="lb"/>came unbearable to Jamadagni and enraged at this
<div n="lb"/>the sage started sending arrows against the Sun. His
<div n="lb"/>wife Reṇukā was supplying him with arrows. When a
<div n="lb"/>set of arrows was finished Reṇukā brought another set.
<div n="lb"/>This continued without break and the Sun began to
<div n="lb"/>feel the attack. Unable to do anything against the sage
<div n="lb"/>the Sun heated the head and foot of Reṇukā on her way
<div n="lb"/>to supply the arrows so fiercely that Reṇukā fell down
<div n="lb"/>under a banyan tree exhausted. When she became well
<div n="lb"/>enough to walk she took the arrows to her husband who
<div n="lb"/>was very angry for her being late. She then explained
<div n="lb"/>to him how because of the extreme heat of the sun she
<div n="lb"/>fell down on the way. Jamadagni then started with
<div n="lb"/>increased fury his shower of arrows and the Sun in the
<div n="lb"/>disguise of a Brahmin approached and advised him that it
<div n="lb"/>was not possible to strike down the Sun because he was
<div n="lb"/>a swift-mover in the sky and so it was better to withdraw
<div n="lb"/>from that attempt. But Jamadagni said the Sun would
[Page182-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>be stationary for some time at midday and then he would
<div n="lb"/>hit the Sun down. When the Sun found that Jamadagni
<div n="lb"/>would never drop his attempt he accepted defeat and
<div n="lb"/>presented Jamadagni with a pair of sandals and an
<div n="lb"/>umbrella to protect against the heat from below and
<div n="lb"/>above. From that day onwards footwear and umbrella
<div n="lb"/>came into vogue.
<div n="NI"/>The practice of presenting sandals and umbrella is
<div n="lb"/>being carried down from generation to generation and
<div n="lb"/>even today it is being followed; these two are given as
<div n="lb"/>gifts on the ‘Śrāddha’ day. (Chapters 95 and 96, Anuśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana Parva, M.B.)
