NĀCIKETA¦ (NACIKETA). A sage of olden days. Son
of Uddālaki, he lived for a long time in the āśrama
serving his father, who devoted his time to performing
yajñas. Naciketa, who was once sent into the forest for
flowers etc. did not find them anywhere there, and he
returned to the āśrama without them. Angry at this
his father cursed him to be taken to Yamaloka.
Accordingly he went to Yamaloka. He waited at the
gates for a long time to see Yama, who appeared at
last when he sang the praises of Yama. The advice
then given by Yama to Naciketa forms the Kaṭhopaniṣad.
After studying the advice he returned to his father, who
was pleased to find him a great scholar. (Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 71).
