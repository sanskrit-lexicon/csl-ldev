BĀLAVINAṢṬAKA¦. The hero of a story, given in Kathā-
saritsāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka, Taraṅga six, to show
that it is not good to make others angry. The story is
as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there was a Brahmin named Rudra Śarmā.
He had two wives. Both gave birth to a son each. The
elder wife died and her son also was brought up by the
younger wife. Being jealous she fed the child with food
too hard for the child and it became lean with stomach
swollen and the bones projecting. It looked an uncouth
figure. Seeing him like this Rudra Śarmā called him Bāla-
vinaṣṭaka (one who is lost when he is a boy). He
gradually grew up. When he was only five years old he
showed extraordinary intelligence. One day he decided
to teach his foster-mother a lesson. On that day he was
sitting alone on the lap of his father. He said to his
father, “Father, I have two fathers”. Thenceforward the
father began to doubt his wife, that she was having a
lover. He grew jealous. He would not talk to her. The foster-
mother thought Bālavinaṣṭaka was the cause for this
change in her husband's behaviour. One day she called
the boy to her mildly and asked him for the reason for
the change in the behaviour of his father towards her.
He said that he would bring about a change in the beha-
viour of his father if he would be cared for properly.
She agreed. Then he took a mirror and held it before
his father and when the reflection of his father fell in
the mirror he said, “Father, I have two fathers”. Imme-
diately the doubt of his father was removed. It is not
right to make even a boy angry.
