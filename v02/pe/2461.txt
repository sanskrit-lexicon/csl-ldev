GOKARṆA¦. A sacred place of Purāṇic importance
<div n="lb"/>situated on the extreme north of Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Origin.%} There was once on the banks of the river,
<div n="lb"/>Tuṅgabhadrā, a village made sacred and prosperous by
<div n="lb"/>the brahmins who lived there. In that village lived a
<div n="lb"/>noble brahmin named Ātmadeva. His wife was a
<div n="lb"/>quarrelsome woman named Dhundhulī. Even after many
<div n="lb"/>years of married life they got no children and
<div n="lb"/>Ātmadeva, greatly grief-stricken, left his home and
<div n="lb"/>went to the forests. He was sitting on the shore of a
<div n="lb"/>lake after quenching his thirst from it when a
<div n="lb"/>Sannyāsin came that way. Ātmadeva told him about his
<div n="lb"/>domestic life and pleaded that he should suggest a way to
<div n="lb"/>get a son for him. The sannyāsin sat in meditation for
<div n="lb"/>some time and contemplated on the horoscope of
<div n="lb"/>Ātmadeva and regretfully informed him that according
<div n="lb"/>to his horoscope he was to have no children for seven
<div n="lb"/>successive births. He, therefore, advised Ātmadeva to
[Page293-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>abandon all his worldly pleasures and accept sannyāsa
<div n="lb"/>for the rest of his life. But Ātmadeva was not to be
<div n="lb"/>discouraged by this prophecy and he urged the
<div n="lb"/>sannyāsin to help him somehow to get a child. The
<div n="lb"/>sanyāsin then gave him a fruit and asked him to give it
<div n="lb"/>to his wife and ask her to observe a life of fasting for a
<div n="lb"/>period of one year.
<div n="NI"/>Greatly pleased with this boon Ātmadeva returned to
<div n="lb"/>his house and told his wife all that had happened and
<div n="lb"/>gave her the fruit. She liked to eat the fruit but a
<div n="lb"/>year's fasting seemed troublesome to her. She was
<div n="lb"/>thinking of how to get over this difficulty when her
<div n="lb"/>younger sister came to her and suggested a plan. She
<div n="lb"/>said “Sister, I am pregnant. I shall give you the
<div n="lb"/>child I deliver. You can declare it as your child and
<div n="lb"/>make your husband believe so. You can announce in
<div n="lb"/>public that you have eaten the fruit and have conse-
<div n="lb"/>quently become pregnant. We can, to test its merit,
<div n="lb"/>give the fruit to a cow.” Dhundhulī liked the plan very
<div n="lb"/>much and so did everything like that.
<div n="NI"/>The news that Dhundhulī was pregnant spread in the
<div n="lb"/>city. Very soon her sister gave birth to a child and
<div n="lb"/>that child was proclaimed as the child of Dhundhulī. On
<div n="lb"/>the pretext that Dhundhulī was short of breast-milk her
<div n="lb"/>sister started doing the breast-feeding. The child was
<div n="lb"/>named Dhundhukāri.
<div n="NI"/>After three months the cow that ate the fruit delivered
<div n="lb"/>a child. The ear of the child was like that of a cow
<div n="lb"/>and so he was called Gokarṇa. Dhundhukāri and
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa grew together. Dhundhukāri became a very
<div n="lb"/>evil-natured boy while Gokarṇa grew into a scholarly
<div n="lb"/>one. Dhundhukāri who was the very seat of everything
<div n="lb"/>bad made the life of their parents wretched and the
<div n="lb"/>disappointed Ātmadeva renounced all and went to the
<div n="lb"/>forests and did penance and attained mokṣa. Unable
<div n="lb"/>to bear the torture by her son, Dhundhulī committed
<div n="lb"/>suicide by jumping into a well. Gokarṇa started on a
<div n="lb"/>pilgrimage.
<div n="NI"/>Dhundhukāri lived in his own house surrounded by
<div n="lb"/>prostitutes. Thieving was his only means of livelihood.
<div n="lb"/>Knowing this the servants of the king started to capture
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhukāri and the prostitutes who lived with him,
<div n="lb"/>for their safety, bound Dhundhukāri with ropes and put
<div n="lb"/>him into fire and killed him. The soul of Dhundhukāri
<div n="lb"/>became a great phantom. Hearing the news of the
<div n="lb"/>death of his brother, Gokarṇa returned home. He
<div n="lb"/>conducted a śrāddha at Gayā to give peace to the soul
<div n="lb"/>of his departed brother. But the phantom of Dhundhu-
<div n="lb"/>kāri was not pacified. This phantom troubled him
<div n="lb"/>always. Gokarṇa was not afraid of it and asked him
<div n="lb"/>what he wanted and the phantom pleaded that in some
<div n="lb"/>way Gokarṇa should get him absolved of all his sins.
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa then consulted Pandits to know what method
<div n="lb"/>should be adopted to save a soul which could not be
<div n="lb"/>saved even by a Gayā-Śrāddha. The Pandits advised
<div n="lb"/>him to do penance to propitiate the Sun. The Sun who
<div n="lb"/>appeared before Gokarṇa as a result of his penance
<div n="lb"/>declared that if he did read the entire Bhāgavata in
<div n="lb"/>seven days Dhundhukāri would get mokṣa. So Gokarṇa
<div n="lb"/>performed a Saptāha and among those who assembled
<div n="lb"/>to hear it was the phantom of Dhundhukāri also. The
<div n="lb"/>phantom finding no place to sit crept into a seven-
<div n="lb"/>layered bamboo and sat there listening to Gokarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>When the first day was over the first layer broke and it
<div n="lb"/>went on like that every day and on the seventh day the
[Page294-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>seventh layer broke and when Gokarṇa finished
<div n="lb"/>the twelfth Skandha the phantom rose from the
<div n="lb"/>bamboo to heaven. When it was going to heaven it
<div n="lb"/>looked at Gokarṇa and told him that his mokṣa was due
<div n="lb"/>to the result of his hearing the saptāha reading. When
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa asked him why none of the others who heard
<div n="lb"/>it got it he said that it was because none had heard it
<div n="lb"/>with such rapt attention as he had done.
<div n="NI"/>Gokarṇa then conducted another reading of Saptāha
<div n="lb"/>and the people present heard the same with rapt
<div n="lb"/>attention. When the reading was over, a chariot of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu from Vaikuṇṭha descended and carried
<div n="lb"/>away all those who heard the reading. The place
<div n="lb"/>where Gokarṇa sat and read the Saptāha became
<div n="lb"/>known later as the famous Gokarṇa. (Chapters 1 to 3,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mitrasaha and Gokarṇa.%} A King of Ayodhyā named
<div n="lb"/>Mitrasaha who became famous by the name of
<div n="lb"/>Kalmāṣapāda, became a demon by a curse of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>He attained mokṣa by living and worshipping God in
<div n="lb"/>the temple at Gokarṇa. (See under Śivarātri for
<div n="lb"/>details).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gokarṇa and the origin of Kerala.%} Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>gives a story associating Gokarṇa with the origin of
<div n="lb"/>Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>By the request of Bhagīratha the river Gaṅgā fell on
<div n="lb"/>earth and flowing as different brooks emptied its waters
<div n="lb"/>in the ocean. The level of the water in the ocean went
<div n="lb"/>up and the temple of Gokarṇa and the land of Kerala
<div n="lb"/>were submerged in waters. The sages who were in the
<div n="lb"/>temple somehow escaped and took refuge on the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Sahya. Paraśurāma was doing penance there
<div n="lb"/>then and the sages went to him and told him of their
<div n="lb"/>plight. Paraśurāma went and stood in Gokarṇa and
<div n="lb"/>threw an axe to the south. All the land from Gokarṇa
<div n="lb"/>up to the place where the axe fell rose up from the
<div n="lb"/>ocean to form a piece of land which was named Kerala.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 97 of Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other Purāṇic details regarding Gokarṇa.%} (i) Bhagīratha
<div n="lb"/>did penance to bring Gaṅgādevī to Earth at Gokarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Sarga 12, Chapter 42, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>ii) The serpent named Śeṣa spent much time living
<div n="lb"/>here. (Chapter 36, Śloka 3, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>iii) Arjuna visited Gokarṇa while he was on his pilgri-
<div n="lb"/>mage. (Śloka 34, Chapter 26, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>iv) Gokarṇa was one of the abodes of Śiva. Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣis, Bhūtas and Yakṣas used to stay at Gokarṇa to
<div n="lb"/>worship Śiva. (Śloka 24, Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>v) The holy place of Gokarṇa is renowned in all the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds (Śloka 15, Chapter 88, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>vi) Gokarṇa is a tapovana also. (Śloka 51, Chapter 6,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>vii) Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna and Pradyumna together killed
<div n="lb"/>Nikuṃbha, who had kidnapped Bhānumatī, at Gokarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 90, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
