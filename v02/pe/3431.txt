KAUŚIKA IV¦. While the Pāṇḍavas were leading forest
<div n="lb"/>life, the hermit Mārkaṇḍeya told the story of a noble
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin named Kauśika, to Dharmaputra. Once this
[Page400-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin sat under a tree and performed penance. A small
<div n="lb"/>crane which sat on a branch of the tree passed excreta
<div n="lb"/>on the head of the Brahmin. He became angry and
<div n="lb"/>looked at the bird. Instantly the bird was reduced to
<div n="lb"/>ashes. The Brahmin sincerely repented and went to the
<div n="lb"/>countryside to live on alms. Once he reached the house
<div n="lb"/>of a Brahmin. The wife of the Brahmin came to the
<div n="lb"/>door and requested him to wait a bit. Immediately her
<div n="lb"/>husband arrived, and she, being engaged in looking
<div n="lb"/>after the needs of her husband forgot the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>Kauśika, who became angry and spoke cruel words to
<div n="lb"/>her. She argued that the noblest deed was looking after
<div n="lb"/>one's husband and that it was not meet and right for
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins to get angry. She advised Kauśika to go to
<div n="lb"/>Mithilāpurī and to receive advice from the famous
<div n="lb"/>Dharmavyādha. Kauśika repented his rash nature,
<div n="lb"/>went to Dharmavyādha and received advice from him.
<div n="lb"/>He returned home and lived peacefully with his parents.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, ten chapters from 206).
<div n="NI"/>Though a man of veracity, he finally had to go to hell,
<div n="lb"/>for the following reason. While he was engaged in
<div n="lb"/>penance in the forest some thieves came by that way with
<div n="lb"/>some stolen goods. The owners of the goods were chasing
<div n="lb"/>the thieves. Kauśika told them the way by which the
<div n="lb"/>thieves had gone. So at the end Kauśika was thrown
<div n="lb"/>into hell. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter 69).
