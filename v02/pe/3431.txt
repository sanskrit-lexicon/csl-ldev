KAUŚIKA IV¦. While the Pāṇḍavas were leading forest
life, the hermit Mārkaṇḍeya told the story of a noble
Brahmin named Kauśika, to Dharmaputra. Once this
[Page400-b+ 65]
Brahmin sat under a tree and performed penance. A small
crane which sat on a branch of the tree passed excreta
on the head of the Brahmin. He became angry and
looked at the bird. Instantly the bird was reduced to
ashes. The Brahmin sincerely repented and went to the
countryside to live on alms. Once he reached the house
of a Brahmin. The wife of the Brahmin came to the
door and requested him to wait a bit. Immediately her
husband arrived, and she, being engaged in looking
after the needs of her husband forgot the Brahmin
Kauśika, who became angry and spoke cruel words to
her. She argued that the noblest deed was looking after
one's husband and that it was not meet and right for
Brahmins to get angry. She advised Kauśika to go to
Mithilāpurī and to receive advice from the famous
Dharmavyādha. Kauśika repented his rash nature,
went to Dharmavyādha and received advice from him.
He returned home and lived peacefully with his parents.
(M.B. Vana Parva, ten chapters from 206).
<div n="NI"/>Though a man of veracity, he finally had to go to hell,
for the following reason. While he was engaged in
penance in the forest some thieves came by that way with
some stolen goods. The owners of the goods were chasing
the thieves. Kauśika told them the way by which the
thieves had gone. So at the end Kauśika was thrown
into hell. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter 69).
