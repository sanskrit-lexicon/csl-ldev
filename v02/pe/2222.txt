DVĀDASĪVRATA¦. A fast ordained in accordance with
the Hindu religion to make an end of the sorrow and
misery in life. There is a history behind this fast or vow
which is performed in the bright lunar fortnight in the
month of Phālguna (Mīna). It is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Once King Mahābali, with a vast army of Asuras, went
to the realm of the gods and drove them out of heaven.
Aditi was much grieved at the misfortune that befell
her sons. Kaśyapa her husband asked her the cause of
her grief. She told him about the fall of gods, and
asked him for a remedy. Kaśyapa told her to observe
Dvādaśīvrata. Aditi took Dvādaśīvrata and Mahābali
was pushed down to Pātāla by Mahāviṣṇu who
incarnated as Vāmana. From that day onwards
Dvādaśīvrata is considered to be holy fast. (Bhāgavata,
Skandha 8).
