DVĀDASĪVRATA¦. A fast ordained in accordance with
<div n="lb"/>the Hindu religion to make an end of the sorrow and
<div n="lb"/>misery in life. There is a history behind this fast or vow
<div n="lb"/>which is performed in the bright lunar fortnight in the
<div n="lb"/>month of Phālguna (Mīna). It is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Once King Mahābali, with a vast army of Asuras, went
<div n="lb"/>to the realm of the gods and drove them out of heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Aditi was much grieved at the misfortune that befell
<div n="lb"/>her sons. Kaśyapa her husband asked her the cause of
<div n="lb"/>her grief. She told him about the fall of gods, and
<div n="lb"/>asked him for a remedy. Kaśyapa told her to observe
<div n="lb"/>Dvādaśīvrata. Aditi took Dvādaśīvrata and Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>was pushed down to Pātāla by Mahāviṣṇu who
<div n="lb"/>incarnated as Vāmana. From that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>Dvādaśīvrata is considered to be holy fast. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 8).
