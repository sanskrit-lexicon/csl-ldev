PŪNTĀNAM¦ NAMBŪTIRI.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The illam (house) of this
<div n="lb"/>Nambūtiri who was a contemporary of Meppattūr
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭatiri was in Nenmeni aṃśa of the taluk
<div n="lb"/>of Valluvanāḍu in south Malabar. Though some say
<div n="lb"/>that his original name was Brahmadatta there are no
<div n="lb"/>sufficient records to support the statement. His Guru
<div n="lb"/>according to the work ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇakarṇāmṛta’ was a
<div n="lb"/>nambūtiri named Nīlakaṇṭha. Pūntānam had only
<div n="lb"/>ordinary education. He worshipped Kṛṣṇa at the temple
<div n="lb"/>of Guruvāyūr for a very long time and became a great
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He lived for ninety years. When he
<div n="lb"/>became very old he found it difficult to come to
<div n="lb"/>Guruvāyūr for worship and so one day he bade farewell
<div n="lb"/>to the deity. Then a voice from heaven said “Do not
<div n="lb"/>worry. I will be near you on your left side.” He went
<div n="lb"/>and sat on a hill named Tirumāndha and to his astonish-
<div n="lb"/>ing ecstasy he found Kṛṣṇa sitting on his left side. He
<div n="lb"/>then constructed a temple there and installed his deity
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa there and continued his worship. That was the
<div n="lb"/>Vāmapura (left place) of Pūntānam.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kṛtis (works).%} The following are the works of
<div n="lb"/>Pūntānam: (i) Bhāṣākarṇāmṛta (ii) Kumārāharaṇam
<div n="lb"/>(Pāna) (iii) Jñānappāna (iv) Pārthasārathistava (v)
<div n="lb"/>Ghanasaṅgha (vi) Nārāyaṇakīrtanas (vii) Govindakīrta-
<div n="lb"/>nas (viii) Ānandanṛtya (ix) Dvādaśākṣaranāmakīrtana
<div n="lb"/>(x) Śrīkṛṣṇakīrtanas (xi) Aṣṭākṣarakīrtana (xii)
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaparagovindakīrtana (xiii) Gopālakṛṣṇakīrtana
<div n="lb"/>(xiv) Gaurīkīrtana (xv) Vāmapureśakīrtanas (xvi)
<div n="lb"/>Padmanābhakīrtana (xvii) Vivekodayakīrtana (xviii)
<div n="lb"/>Jayakṛṣṇakīrtana (xix) Viṭakolkīrtana (xx) Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>Kirtana (xxi) Mukundakīrtana (xxii) Daśāvatārastotra.
<div n="lb"/>Besides these he has composed some philosophical
<div n="lb"/>songs in Tamil also.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jñānappāna.%} Pūntānam got a son after a long time
<div n="lb"/>of prayer and for the ceremony of Annaprāśana (feed-
<div n="lb"/>ing rice for the first time) all the people of his commu-
<div n="lb"/>nity were invited. The women who came for the
<div n="lb"/>function threw their upper garments on to the cradle
<div n="lb"/>where the little child was suffocated to death. Pūntānam
<div n="lb"/>thereafter became disgusted with life and Jñānappāna
<div n="lb"/>was written at that time.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Santānagopālam.%} Pūntānam spent most of his time
<div n="lb"/>in the temple of Guruvāyūr after the death of his child.
<div n="lb"/>It was at this same time that the great scholar Nārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇabhaṭṭatiri, author of the famous Nārāyaṇīya, was
<div n="lb"/>in the temple worshipping the deity there. Pūntānam
<div n="lb"/>had written a poem ‘Santānagopālam’ in the pāna style
<div n="lb"/>and he took it to the great pandit Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭatiri
<div n="lb"/>for correction. With the haughtiness that was his trait he
<div n="lb"/>said “What is there for correction in a Malayālam
<div n="lb"/>poem? Nothing but blunders will there be in it. Espe-
<div n="lb"/>cialy when Pūntānam is not well-versed in Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>grammar. It will therefore be full of mistakes.” Pūntā-
<div n="lb"/>nam could not contain the rebuff and he wept bitterly.
<div n="lb"/>Then from the inside of the temple came a voice which
<div n="lb"/>said “Though Pūntānam is not a grammarian like you
<div n="lb"/>Bhaṭṭatiri, he is a greater devotee of mine than you.
<div n="lb"/>His Bhakti is more appealing to me than your vibhakti.”
<div n="lb"/>The divine voice made Bhaṭṭatiri feel sorry and ashamed
<div n="lb"/>of his behaviour and he begged Pūntānam to grant him
[Page616-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>pardon and immediately went through his work giving
<div n="lb"/>suggestions for improvement.
