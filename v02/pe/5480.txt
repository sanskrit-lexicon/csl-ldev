PŪNTĀNAM¦ NAMBŪTIRI.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The illam (house) of this
Nambūtiri who was a contemporary of Meppattūr
Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭatiri was in Nenmeni aṃśa of the taluk
of Valluvanāḍu in south Malabar. Though some say
that his original name was Brahmadatta there are no
sufficient records to support the statement. His Guru
according to the work ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇakarṇāmṛta’ was a
nambūtiri named Nīlakaṇṭha. Pūntānam had only
ordinary education. He worshipped Kṛṣṇa at the temple
of Guruvāyūr for a very long time and became a great
devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He lived for ninety years. When he
became very old he found it difficult to come to
Guruvāyūr for worship and so one day he bade farewell
to the deity. Then a voice from heaven said “Do not
worry. I will be near you on your left side.” He went
and sat on a hill named Tirumāndha and to his astonish-
ing ecstasy he found Kṛṣṇa sitting on his left side. He
then constructed a temple there and installed his deity
Kṛṣṇa there and continued his worship. That was the
Vāmapura (left place) of Pūntānam.

Besides these he has composed some philosophical

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jñānappāna.%} Pūntānam got a son after a long time
of prayer and for the ceremony of Annaprāśana (feed-
ing rice for the first time) all the people of his commu-
nity were invited. The women who came for the
function threw their upper garments on to the cradle
where the little child was suffocated to death. Pūntānam
thereafter became disgusted with life and Jñānappāna
was written at that time.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Santānagopālam.%} Pūntānam spent most of his time
in the temple of Guruvāyūr after the death of his child.
It was at this same time that the great scholar Nārā-
yaṇabhaṭṭatiri, author of the famous Nārāyaṇīya, was
in the temple worshipping the deity there. Pūntānam
had written a poem ‘Santānagopālam’ in the pāna style
and he took it to the great pandit Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭatiri
for correction. With the haughtiness that was his trait he
said “What is there for correction in a Malayālam
poem? Nothing but blunders will there be in it. Espe-
cialy when Pūntānam is not well-versed in Sanskrit
grammar. It will therefore be full of mistakes.” Pūntā-
nam could not contain the rebuff and he wept bitterly.
Then from the inside of the temple came a voice which
said “Though Pūntānam is not a grammarian like you
Bhaṭṭatiri, he is a greater devotee of mine than you.
His Bhakti is more appealing to me than your vibhakti.”
The divine voice made Bhaṭṭatiri feel sorry and ashamed
of his behaviour and he begged Pūntānam to grant him

pardon and immediately went through his work giving
suggestions for improvement.
