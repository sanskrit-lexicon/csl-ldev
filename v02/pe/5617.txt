RĀJANĪTI¦. (Politics and administration).
<div n="NI"/>Politics and administration or administrative politics in
ancient India is dealt with in Manusmṛti and Agni
Purāṇa. A very brief summary of it is given below:
<div n="NI"/>The King should organise six kinds of army formations,
worship the Devas duly and then set out for war.
Mūlabala, Bhūtabala, Śreṇībala, Suhṛdbala, Śatrubala
and Āṭavikabala are the six kinds of army formations.
The list is given in order of the comparative importance
of the bala. The army has six parts i.e. Mantra (advi-
sers), Koṣa (treasury), Padāti (infantry), Turaga
(Cavalry), Gaja (elephant) and Ratha (chariot).
<div n="NI"/>If an attack is feared either against the forts or across
rivers or trenches, the army should be marched for their
protection. The Army Chieftains surrounded by mighty
warriors should lead the divisions. The King and his
wife should be at the centre of the army-division along
with the treasury and first class soldiers. On both sides
of the King should march the cavalry and the chariots
should form the farther wings. Elephants should proceed
on the two sides of the chariot and soldiers recruited
from forests must march on the sides of the elephants.
The supreme commander will march behind all the
others guiding the army.
<div n="NI"/>If there is cause for fear in front of the army during
the march, three Vyūhas (Phalanxes) Makara, Śyena
or Sūcī should be put in the Vanguard. The Śakaṭa
Vyūha is more suited to meet an attack from behind. If
attack is feared from the flanks then also the Śakaṭa-
vyūha is advisable. When attack from all the sides is
feared sarvatobhadravyūha is indicated. It is the duty
of the Supreme Commander to safe-guard his army
and suppress reactionary forces whenever the army gets
weakened, when it marches through caves, mountains or
[Page628-a+ 64]
rocks or other difficult terrain or weakened by the
persistent attacks of the enemy.
<div n="NI"/>When the time, place and the people's attitude are
favourable, the King should engage himself in open war
with the enemy, and if they are unfavourable he shall
not go in for war. If confrontation with the enemy
occurs under circumstances in which the King is visible
to the enemy, powerful divisions of the army consisting
of warriors of great calibre should be stationed either at
the front or in the rear.
<div n="NI"/>In the formation of vyūhas (phalanx) there are seven
factors called Uras (breast), Kakṣas (arm-pits), two
Pakṣas (sides), two Madhyas (centre) and Pṛṣṭha
(rear). The commanders should be surrounded by
bold soldiers. The leader is the very life of the war.
At the Uras of the vyūha powerful elephants, at the
Kakṣas chariots and at the Pakṣas cavalry should be
stationed. This is called pakṣabhedivyūha. If at the
centre cavalry and at Kakṣas and Pakṣas elephants are
stationed, it is called antarbhedivyūha. If there are no
chariots, cavalry or infantry may be put in their place.
Certain authorities maintain that in every vyūha
elephants may be stationed in the place of chariots, if
chariots are not available. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 242).
