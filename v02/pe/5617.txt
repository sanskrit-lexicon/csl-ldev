RĀJANĪTI¦. (Politics and administration).
<div n="NI"/>Politics and administration or administrative politics in
<div n="lb"/>ancient India is dealt with in Manusmṛti and Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa. A very brief summary of it is given below:
<div n="NI"/>The King should organise six kinds of army formations,
<div n="lb"/>worship the Devas duly and then set out for war.
<div n="lb"/>Mūlabala, Bhūtabala, Śreṇībala, Suhṛdbala, Śatrubala
<div n="lb"/>and Āṭavikabala are the six kinds of army formations.
<div n="lb"/>The list is given in order of the comparative importance
<div n="lb"/>of the bala. The army has six parts i.e. Mantra (advi-
<div n="lb"/>sers), Koṣa (treasury), Padāti (infantry), Turaga
<div n="lb"/>(Cavalry), Gaja (elephant) and Ratha (chariot).
<div n="NI"/>If an attack is feared either against the forts or across
<div n="lb"/>rivers or trenches, the army should be marched for their
<div n="lb"/>protection. The Army Chieftains surrounded by mighty
<div n="lb"/>warriors should lead the divisions. The King and his
<div n="lb"/>wife should be at the centre of the army-division along
<div n="lb"/>with the treasury and first class soldiers. On both sides
<div n="lb"/>of the King should march the cavalry and the chariots
<div n="lb"/>should form the farther wings. Elephants should proceed
<div n="lb"/>on the two sides of the chariot and soldiers recruited
<div n="lb"/>from forests must march on the sides of the elephants.
<div n="lb"/>The supreme commander will march behind all the
<div n="lb"/>others guiding the army.
<div n="NI"/>If there is cause for fear in front of the army during
<div n="lb"/>the march, three Vyūhas (Phalanxes) Makara, Śyena
<div n="lb"/>or Sūcī should be put in the Vanguard. The Śakaṭa
<div n="lb"/>Vyūha is more suited to meet an attack from behind. If
<div n="lb"/>attack is feared from the flanks then also the Śakaṭa-
<div n="lb"/>vyūha is advisable. When attack from all the sides is
<div n="lb"/>feared sarvatobhadravyūha is indicated. It is the duty
<div n="lb"/>of the Supreme Commander to safe-guard his army
<div n="lb"/>and suppress reactionary forces whenever the army gets
<div n="lb"/>weakened, when it marches through caves, mountains or
[Page628-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>rocks or other difficult terrain or weakened by the
<div n="lb"/>persistent attacks of the enemy.
<div n="NI"/>When the time, place and the people's attitude are
<div n="lb"/>favourable, the King should engage himself in open war
<div n="lb"/>with the enemy, and if they are unfavourable he shall
<div n="lb"/>not go in for war. If confrontation with the enemy
<div n="lb"/>occurs under circumstances in which the King is visible
<div n="lb"/>to the enemy, powerful divisions of the army consisting
<div n="lb"/>of warriors of great calibre should be stationed either at
<div n="lb"/>the front or in the rear.
<div n="NI"/>In the formation of vyūhas (phalanx) there are seven
<div n="lb"/>factors called Uras (breast), Kakṣas (arm-pits), two
<div n="lb"/>Pakṣas (sides), two Madhyas (centre) and Pṛṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>(rear). The commanders should be surrounded by
<div n="lb"/>bold soldiers. The leader is the very life of the war.
<div n="lb"/>At the Uras of the vyūha powerful elephants, at the
<div n="lb"/>Kakṣas chariots and at the Pakṣas cavalry should be
<div n="lb"/>stationed. This is called pakṣabhedivyūha. If at the
<div n="lb"/>centre cavalry and at Kakṣas and Pakṣas elephants are
<div n="lb"/>stationed, it is called antarbhedivyūha. If there are no
<div n="lb"/>chariots, cavalry or infantry may be put in their place.
<div n="lb"/>Certain authorities maintain that in every vyūha
<div n="lb"/>elephants may be stationed in the place of chariots, if
<div n="lb"/>chariots are not available. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 242).
