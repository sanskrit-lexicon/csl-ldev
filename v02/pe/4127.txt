MAHĀMERU¦. The golden coloured peak of Himavān.
<div n="lb"/>The seat of Lord Śiva, according to the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General features.%} Mahāmeru surpasses even the sun
<div n="lb"/>in its dazzling golden brilliance. Devas and Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>attend on it on all sides. It is inaccessible to sinners.
<div n="lb"/>There are celestial herbs and serpents at its base. It is
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru that keeps Heaven in its place by supporting
<div n="lb"/>it. The atmosphere there, is always alive with the
<div n="lb"/>sweet songs of various kinds of birds. Precious stones
<div n="lb"/>are scattered all over its surface. All the 33 crores of
<div n="lb"/>gods dwell on the sides of this Mountain. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 17).
<div n="NI"/>Saptarṣis like Vasiṣṭha rise and fall on Mahāmeru.
<div n="lb"/>Mahā Viṣṇu and Brahmā have their places in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru. Viṣṇu's place is in the east. There is a special
<div n="lb"/>place there for the residence of Maharṣis. Those who
<div n="lb"/>go to Mahāmeru never return. The Sun and Moon go
<div n="lb"/>round. Mahāmeru everyday. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 163).
<div n="NI"/>There are twenty mountains surrounding Mahāmeru.
<div n="lb"/>On the eastern side there are two mountains, Jāra and
<div n="lb"/>Devakūṭa. On the western side there are two mountains,
<div n="lb"/>Pavamāna and Pāriyātra. On the southern side are the
<div n="lb"/>two mountains, Kailāsa and Karavīra and on the north-
<div n="lb"/>ern side, the two mountains, Triśṛṅga and Makaragiri.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Mahāmeru shines like the sun in the midst of
<div n="lb"/>eight mountains. In the middle of Mahāmeru is situat-
<div n="lb"/>ed Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahmā in a square
<div n="lb"/>extending over 10,000 yojanas. This region is of inex-
<div n="lb"/>pressible splendour. At eight places around this
<div n="lb"/>Brahmapurī, are situated the eight posts or abodes of
<div n="lb"/>the Aṣṭadikpālas, each of the abodes being 25000
<div n="lb"/>yojanas in extent. Thus there are nine Purīs or Cities
[Page463-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>on the top of Mahāmeru. They are:— (1) Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>Manovatī in the centre. (2) Due east of it, Indra's
<div n="lb"/>Amarāvatī. (3) In the south-east corner, Agni's
<div n="lb"/>Tejovatī. (4) On the southern side, Yama's Saṃyamanī.
<div n="lb"/>(5) In the south west corner, Nirrti's Kṛṣṇāñjana,
<div n="lb"/>(6) On the western side, Varuṇa's Śraddhāvatī. (7)
<div n="lb"/>In the north-west corner, Vāyu's Gandhavatī. (8) On
<div n="lb"/>the northern side, Kubera's Mahodaya. (9) In the north
<div n="lb"/>cast corner, Īśān'as Yaśovatī. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>8th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mahāmeru and Laṅkā.%} Rāvaṇa's place of abode Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>was really a peak of Mahāmeru. (For further details, see
<div n="lb"/>the previous history of Laṅkā in Para 5 under the word
<div n="lb"/>Kubera).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Mahāmeru got its golden colour.%} The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>declare that the sun keeps going round Mahāmeru.
<div n="lb"/>Once, while the sun was thus going round, he
<div n="lb"/>wished to take a little rest. He asked permission to
<div n="lb"/>place the axle of his chariot for a short while on Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru. The mountain agreed to it. The grateful Sun-
<div n="lb"/>god (Sūrya) blessed Mahāmeru that it would thence-
<div n="lb"/>forth have golden colour. Until it received this blessing,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru had the colour of ordinary mountains.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Two daughters named Āyati and Niyati were born
<div n="lb"/>to Mahāmeru. They were married by Dhātā and
<div n="lb"/>Vidhātā respectively. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>10).

<div n="lb"/>ern side of Mahāmeru. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter

<div n="NI"/>(v) At the time of Emperor Pṛthu, the earth was turned
<div n="lb"/>into a cow and all living beings obtained all their
<div n="lb"/>necessaries by milking her. It was Mahāmeru who
<div n="lb"/>stood as milking man on behalf of the mountains.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 69, Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) In Tripuradahana, it was Mahāmeru which was
<div n="lb"/>erected as the flag-staff in Śiva's chariot. (M.B. Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 202, Verse 78).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Mahāmeru presented two Pārṣadas named
<div n="lb"/>Kāñcana and Meghamālī to Subrahmaṇya. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 48).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Mahāmeru once presented heaps of gold to
<div n="lb"/>Emperor Pṛthu. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 59,
