VARIṢṬHA¦. The son of Manu Cākṣuṣa. The following
story, how Variṣṭha cursed the hermit Grtsamada,
occurs in Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 18.
Indra once performed a sacrifice which lasted for a
thousand years. Variṣṭha and Gṛtsamada, as friends of
Indra were present at the sacrifice. Gṛtsamada committ-
ed some mistakes in the recitation of Sāmans. Variṣṭha
got angry and cursed Gṛtsamada that he would wander
in the forest as an animal for ten thousand one hundred
and eighteen years. Accordingly Gṛtsamada wandered
through forests in the form of an animal for a very long
time.
