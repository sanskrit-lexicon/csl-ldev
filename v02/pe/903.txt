BĀLĀKI¦. A hermit. He is called Gārgya also as he is
a son of Garga. He acquired much knowledge and so
he became arrogant. Because of this some called him
Dṛptabālāki.
<div n="NI"/>Once the hermit went to the King of Kāśī and told him
that he would impart to him the knowledge of Brahma.
The king replied that he would give thousand cows in
return. Bālāki declared that the sun-god was Brahmā.
The king said that he had known it. Everything that
Bālāki said had been known to the king earlier.
So, in the end Bālāki had to become the disciple of the
King. Then the King took him to a man who was sleep-
ing. The King called the sleeping man. But he did not
wake up. The King woke him up and then asked the
hermit, where he had gone when he was sleeping. Bālāki
could not say where men go when they are sleeping
and where they return from when they wake up. The
king said “In our sleep we attain ‘Sārūpya’ (assimila-
tion to god). But we are not aware of it. Though
we get eternal bliss we do not know it. If we can get
eternal bliss when we keep awake that is ‘Ātmajñāna’
(knowledge of Supreme Soul). As the flames emanate
from fire, and as the spider weaves its net and sits in its
centre, the soul creates everything, controls everything
and pervades everything.” (Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad).
