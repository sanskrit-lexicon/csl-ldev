BĀLĀKI¦. A hermit. He is called Gārgya also as he is
<div n="lb"/>a son of Garga. He acquired much knowledge and so
<div n="lb"/>he became arrogant. Because of this some called him
<div n="lb"/>Dṛptabālāki.
<div n="NI"/>Once the hermit went to the King of Kāśī and told him
<div n="lb"/>that he would impart to him the knowledge of Brahma.
<div n="lb"/>The king replied that he would give thousand cows in
<div n="lb"/>return. Bālāki declared that the sun-god was Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>The king said that he had known it. Everything that
<div n="lb"/>Bālāki said had been known to the king earlier.
<div n="lb"/>So, in the end Bālāki had to become the disciple of the
<div n="lb"/>King. Then the King took him to a man who was sleep-
<div n="lb"/>ing. The King called the sleeping man. But he did not
<div n="lb"/>wake up. The King woke him up and then asked the
<div n="lb"/>hermit, where he had gone when he was sleeping. Bālāki
<div n="lb"/>could not say where men go when they are sleeping
<div n="lb"/>and where they return from when they wake up. The
<div n="lb"/>king said “In our sleep we attain ‘Sārūpya’ (assimila-
<div n="lb"/>tion to god). But we are not aware of it. Though
<div n="lb"/>we get eternal bliss we do not know it. If we can get
<div n="lb"/>eternal bliss when we keep awake that is ‘Ātmajñāna’
<div n="lb"/>(knowledge of Supreme Soul). As the flames emanate
<div n="lb"/>from fire, and as the spider weaves its net and sits in its
<div n="lb"/>centre, the soul creates everything, controls everything
<div n="lb"/>and pervades everything.” (Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad).
