PUṆYAŚĪLA¦. A brahmin who was residing on the banks
<div n="lb"/>of the river Godāvarī. Once Puṇyaśīla engaged a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin widower for officiating in a Śrāddha ceremony.
<div n="lb"/>As a result of that sin Puṇyaśīla's face became that of
<div n="lb"/>a donkey. To be freed from the sin he went and
<div n="lb"/>bathed in the Svāmitīrtha and Ākāśagaṅgātīrtha of
<div n="lb"/>Veṅkaṭācala. His sin was washed away and his face
<div n="lb"/>regained its original form. (Chapter 2, Skanda Purāṇa)
