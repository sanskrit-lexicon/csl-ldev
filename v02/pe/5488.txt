PUṆYAŚĪLA¦. A brahmin who was residing on the banks
of the river Godāvarī. Once Puṇyaśīla engaged a
brahmin widower for officiating in a Śrāddha ceremony.
As a result of that sin Puṇyaśīla's face became that of
a donkey. To be freed from the sin he went and
bathed in the Svāmitīrtha and Ākāśagaṅgātīrtha of
Veṅkaṭācala. His sin was washed away and his face
regained its original form. (Chapter 2, Skanda Purāṇa)
