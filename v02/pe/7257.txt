ŚŪRPAṆAKHĀ¦. Rāvaṇa's sister.
<div n="NI"/>1) Viśravas, son of Brahmā and Kaikasī daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Sumālī lived in the forest called Sleṣmātaka.
<div n="lb"/>Once Kaikasī had a sexual union with Viśravas at an
<div n="lb"/>untimely hour. As a result of this union, Kaikasī
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to four children at intervals of one Yāma
<div n="lb"/>each. These children were, Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa and Śūrpaṇakhā. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Domestic Life.%} Śūrpaṇakhā was married to the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa, Vidyujjihva. The son who was born to the
<div n="lb"/>couple was named Śambhukumāra.
<div n="NI"/>The Kālakeyas were the brothers of Vidyujjihva. At
<div n="lb"/>the time of Rāvaṇa's return after his triumphal march,
<div n="lb"/>a battle took place between him and the Kālakeyas.
<div n="lb"/>The Kālakeyas fell under the sword of Rāvaṇa. Enraged
<div n="lb"/>at the death of his brothers, Vidyujjihva encountered
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. In the battle that followed, Vidyujjihva was
<div n="lb"/>killed. On hearing about her husband's death, Śūrpa-
<div n="lb"/>ṇakhā went to Rāvaṇa wailing and lamenting. Moved
<div n="lb"/>to pity at the sight of her tears, Rāvaṇa said:- “Dear
<div n="lb"/>Sister! You may travel through the three worlds and
<div n="lb"/>accept any man you like as your husband. Is there any
<div n="lb"/>one who would not wish to become my relative? Go
<div n="lb"/>and marry a husband suited to you. If any one turns
<div n="lb"/>down your proposal, just inform me. I shall come and
<div n="lb"/>make him your husband.”
<div n="NI"/>Śūrpaṇakhā was pleased. She at once started going
[Page769-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>round the three worlds with Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa; Kambarāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Before Lakṣmaṇa.%} Śūrpaṇakhā's son, Śambhukumāra
<div n="lb"/>was performing tapas to Śiva in Daṇḍakāraṇya. It was
<div n="lb"/>at this time that Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa arrived in the
<div n="lb"/>forest, accompanied by Sītā. They reached the place
<div n="lb"/>called Pañcavaṭī in Daṇḍakāraṇya. Śrī Rāma wished
<div n="lb"/>to set up his hermitage in the middle of the five “vaṭa”
<div n="lb"/>trees in Pañcavaṭī.
<div n="NI"/>At the very sight of Sītā, Śambhukumāra fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with her. He stood there in the form of a tree. While
<div n="lb"/>building the hermitage, Lakṣmana felled that tree and
<div n="lb"/>thus Śambhukumāra was killed. (See under Śambhu-
<div n="lb"/>kumāra).
<div n="NI"/>The widowed Śūrpaṇakhā, in her search for a suitable
<div n="lb"/>husband happened to reach and settle down at the
<div n="lb"/>southern border of Daṇḍakāraṇya. She had failed in
<div n="lb"/>her search so far.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this stage that she came to know of Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and his party. She disguised herself as Lalitā and
<div n="lb"/>entered Śrī Rāma's āsrama. The sight of Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>made her a victim to carnal passion. She submitted
<div n="lb"/>her desire to him, but he turned down her prayer. The
<div n="lb"/>disappointed Śūrpaṇakhā left the āśrama at once. But
<div n="lb"/>she appeared again in front of Sītā. Feeling that so long
<div n="lb"/>as Sītā was alive, Śrī Rāma would not be prepared to
<div n="lb"/>court her, Śūrpaṇakhā rushed furiously at Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmaṇa who was watching the whole scene, suddenly
<div n="lb"/>rushed to the spot and pushed her out of the āśrama.
<div n="lb"/>He cut off her ears, nose and breasts.
<div n="NI"/>Śūrpaṇakhā, bleeding profusely from her mutilation,
<div n="lb"/>hastened to her brother Rāvaṇa to inform him of the
<div n="lb"/>calamity. In obedience to Rāvaṇa's command, Khara,
<div n="lb"/>Dūṣaṇa and others who came and encountered
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, were also slain in the battle.
<div n="lb"/>(Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa).
