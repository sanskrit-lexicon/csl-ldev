TĀRAKA¦ (TĀRAKĀSURA) I. An asura chief (demon).
<div n="lb"/>This demon even while he was very young did penance
<div n="lb"/>to propitiate Śiva and got a boon to the effect that
<div n="lb"/>none other than a son born to Śiva should be able to
<div n="lb"/>kill him. He became arrogant with the power of this
<div n="lb"/>boon and soon became a terror to the world. Then to
<div n="lb"/>kill Tārakāsura Subrahmaṇya was born as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. In the great battle between the devas and the asuras
<div n="lb"/>Tāraka was killed by Subrahmaṇya.
<div n="NI"/>Tārakāsura was the father of Tārākṣa, Kamalākṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Vidyunmālika. (See under Subrahmaṇya). (Śloka 5,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 33, Karṇa Parva).
