TĀRAKA¦ (TĀRAKĀSURA) I. An asura chief (demon).
This demon even while he was very young did penance
to propitiate Śiva and got a boon to the effect that
none other than a son born to Śiva should be able to
kill him. He became arrogant with the power of this
boon and soon became a terror to the world. Then to
kill Tārakāsura Subrahmaṇya was born as the son of
Śiva. In the great battle between the devas and the asuras
Tāraka was killed by Subrahmaṇya.
<div n="NI"/>Tārakāsura was the father of Tārākṣa, Kamalākṣa and
Vidyunmālika. (See under Subrahmaṇya). (Śloka 5,
Chapter 33, Karṇa Parva).
