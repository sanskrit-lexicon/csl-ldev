PURAÑJANA¦. A king. The story of this king was told to
<div n="lb"/>king Prācīnabarhis by Nārada to illustrate the truth
<div n="lb"/>that those who kill yajña cows on earth would surely
<div n="lb"/>suffer its consequences at one time or another.
<div n="NI"/>Purañjana once started on a tour after killing a few
<div n="lb"/>yajña cows. His aim was to build a new palace. After
<div n="lb"/>walking alone for a long time he reached the neigh-
<div n="lb"/>bourhood of Himālayas. While wandering in the forests
<div n="lb"/>he saw a beautiful garden and by its side a big castle
<div n="lb"/>with nine tower-gates. It was the residence of the
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva lady Purañjanī. She had innumerable girl
<div n="lb"/>companions and her castle was guarded by a five-hooded
<div n="lb"/>cobra called Prajāgiri.
<div n="NI"/>Purañjanī fell in love with Purañjana at first sight
<div n="lb"/>and their greetings and subsequent talks ended in their
<div n="lb"/>marriage. Thus Purañjana became the husband of
<div n="lb"/>Purañjanī and they lived happily an erotic life for a
<div n="lb"/>hundred years. Then one day the king went for hunting
<div n="lb"/>alone. Even that separation for a little while from
<div n="lb"/>Purañjanī was unbearable to Purañjana and he returned
<div n="lb"/>to his palace soon. Purañjanī did not come to receive
<div n="lb"/>him. On enquiry her companions informed the king
<div n="lb"/>that Purañjanī was lying on the floor with grief unable
<div n="lb"/>to bear the separation from the king. Purañjana con-
<div n="lb"/>soled her and they lived again for many years in per-
<div n="lb"/>fect happiness. Then one thing happened.
<div n="NI"/>Kāla had a daughter named Kālakanyakā who lived
<div n="lb"/>a very wicked and vicious life. She wanted to get marri-
<div n="lb"/>ed but nobody wanted to be her husband. Śhe went
<div n="lb"/>about in search of a husband. Pūru became her husband
<div n="lb"/>for some time but she was soon divorced by him. She
<div n="lb"/>approached a Yavana king named Bhaya who had a
<div n="lb"/>brother called Prajvara. Bhaya did not want to take
<div n="lb"/>that woman as his wife and so sent her back with a
<div n="lb"/>boon that she could stand in hiding and enjoy all
<div n="lb"/>men she liked. He sent his brother Prajvara for her
<div n="lb"/>help. She roamed about like that for some time and
<div n="lb"/>came back again to Bhaya. Kālakanyakā, Bhaya and
<div n="lb"/>Prajvara joined together and gathering a strong army
<div n="lb"/>attacked Purañjana. A grim battle followed which
<div n="lb"/>lasted for several years in the end of which Purañjana
<div n="lb"/>was defeated and taken captive. While he was being
<div n="lb"/>taken as a prisoner a herd of wild cows attacked Pura-
<div n="lb"/>ñjana and he was killed. After that he was born as a
<div n="lb"/>princess named Vaidarbhī. Malayadhvaja, king of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍya, married her and got seven celebrated sons.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya married the daughter of Malayadhvaja.
<div n="lb"/>(4th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
