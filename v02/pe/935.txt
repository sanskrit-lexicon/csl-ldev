BĀṆA¦ (BĀṆABHAṬṬA) I. A Sanskrit poet who lived in
<div n="lb"/>the 7th century A.D. He was a member of the assem-
<div n="lb"/>bly of emperor Harṣavardhana. ‘Harṣacarita’ (prose)
<div n="lb"/>is the most important work of Bāṇa. Though many of
<div n="lb"/>the descriptions in this book contain exaggerations it
<div n="lb"/>affords plenty of scope for investigation into the fea-
<div n="lb"/>tures of ancient Sanskrit literature. He has mentioned
<div n="lb"/>about Vyāsa, Bhaṭṭāra-hariścandra, Sātavāhana,
<div n="lb"/>Pravarasena, Bhāsa, Kālidāsa and such others.
<div n="NI"/>Harṣacarita, in a sense, is a Romance. It is divided
<div n="lb"/>into eight Ucchvāsas. From the first two or three
<div n="lb"/>chapters informations could be had of Bāṇabhaṭṭa.
<div n="lb"/>His mother Rājyadevī died when he was a little boy.
<div n="lb"/>At the age of fourteen his father also died. After that
<div n="lb"/>he arrived at the palace of Harṣa. The story of Harṣa-
<div n="lb"/>carita begins with the death of Prabhākara-Vardhana,
<div n="lb"/>father of Harṣa. The Book ends with the story incom-
<div n="lb"/>plete. Harṣacarita is the only historic prose work
<div n="lb"/>available in Sanskrit.
