BĀṆA¦ (BĀṆABHAṬṬA) I. A Sanskrit poet who lived in
the 7th century A.D. He was a member of the assem-
bly of emperor Harṣavardhana. ‘Harṣacarita’ (prose)
is the most important work of Bāṇa. Though many of
the descriptions in this book contain exaggerations it
affords plenty of scope for investigation into the fea-
tures of ancient Sanskrit literature. He has mentioned
about Vyāsa, Bhaṭṭāra-hariścandra, Sātavāhana,
Pravarasena, Bhāsa, Kālidāsa and such others.
<div n="NI"/>Harṣacarita, in a sense, is a Romance. It is divided
into eight Ucchvāsas. From the first two or three
chapters informations could be had of Bāṇabhaṭṭa.
His mother Rājyadevī died when he was a little boy.
At the age of fourteen his father also died. After that
he arrived at the palace of Harṣa. The story of Harṣa-
carita begins with the death of Prabhākara-Vardhana,
father of Harṣa. The Book ends with the story incom-
plete. Harṣacarita is the only historic prose work
available in Sanskrit.
