SUDEVA IV¦. A famous King. Nābhāga married
<div n="lb"/>Suprabhā the daughter of this King Sudeva. The
<div n="lb"/>following is a story taken from Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>stating how this Sudeva who was a Kṣatriya by birth,
<div n="lb"/>became a Vaiśya by the curse of hermit Pramati.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nala, the friend of Sudeva, and the relative of
<div n="lb"/>Dhūmrākṣa, after having drunk too much liquor, tried
<div n="lb"/>to rape the wife of the hermit Pramati. All this happen-
<div n="lb"/>ed while King Sudeva was standing silently near Nala.
<div n="lb"/>Pramati requested King Sudeva repeatedly to save his
<div n="lb"/>wife. Sudeva replied: ‘The Kṣatriya who could help
<div n="lb"/>the needy, could save your wife also. But I am a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya.” This arrogance of the King made the
<div n="lb"/>hermit angry. “May you become a Vaiśya.”
<div n="lb"/>The hermit cursed the King. Sudeva repented
<div n="lb"/>and requested for liberation from the curse. “When a
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya steals away your daughter you will recover
<div n="lb"/>the lost feelings of Kṣatriya.” The hermit gave this
<div n="lb"/>liberation from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>Because of this curse Nābhāga stole away Suprabhā
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Sudeva and Sudeva got back the lost
<div n="lb"/>feelings of Kṣatriya.
