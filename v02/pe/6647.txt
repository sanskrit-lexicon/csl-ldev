ŚIVA¦ (RUDRA). One of the Trinity.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The seers or spiritual giants of India imagined
three forms to God, dividing all the activities into three
departments, i.e. creation, sustenance and destruction or
annihilation. Brahmā, for creation, Viṣṇu, for susten-
ance and Śiva, for annihilation-they are the Trinity.
Viṣṇu was born first, Brahmā next and Śiva last. The
essence of Indian spiritualistic thought is that these three
visible forms of God will, at the close of the Kalpa
cease to be and become one with the cosmic power, and
that the trinity will be born again at the commence-
ment of the Kalpa and will take up their respective
functions.
<div n="NI"/>The dominant quality or attribute of Śiva is Tamas
(darkness). Many stories, with slight variations, are told
in the various Purāṇas about the birth of Śiva. Some
of the more important stories are summarised below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) At the beginning of the Kalpa, while Brahmā was
meditating upon the birth of a son like himself, a child
deep blue in colour, appeared on his lap, and the child
began running about crying aloud. Brahmā asked the
child why it was crying; then the child asked Brahmā
to give him a name. Though Brahmā told him that
his name was Rudra and asked him not to cry, he
cried seven times more. Then Brahmā gave him another
[Page724-a+ 65]
seven names, and for the total eight names eight
Mūrtis (forms) wives and children were allotted. Bhava,
Śarva, Īśāna, Paśupati, Bhīma, Ugra and Mahādeva
were the additional seven names, and Sun, Water,
Earth, Wind, Fire, Sky, the Brahmin who has taken
dīkṣā and Moon were the eight Mūrtis and the presiding
deities allotted to them. To these deities the following
wives were also allotted, i.e. Suvarcalā, Uṣā, Vikeśī, Śivā,
Svāhā, Diśā, Dīkṣā and Rohiṇī. The world is full with
their progenies. Śanaiścara, Śukra, Lohitāṅga, Mano-
java, Skanda, Sarga, Santāna and Budha are the sons of
the above eight wives. This Rudra married Satī, daugh-
ter of Dakṣaprajāpati. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Brahmā whose predominant quality or attribute
is rajas was born from the navel of Mahāviṣṇu. From
the Centre of the brow of Brahmā was born Rudra of
Tāmasic quality. Brahmā, by the power of his tapas,
acquired the power of creation and created a red-col-
oured world by his attribute of rajas. The very same
world is annihilated by Rudra at the close of the Kalpa
period. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) From the wrath of Brahmā was born Rudra, from
his lap Nārada, from his finger Dakṣa, from his mind
Sanaka and others, and from his left finger a daughter
called Vīraṇī. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Four ‘mental sons’ of Brahmā Sanaka, Sanandana
Sanātana and Sanatkumāra showed disinclination to
beget progenies. Brahmā got angry at this attitude of
the four sons and from the centre of his brow was born
a body blue and white in colour, and he, in tears,
requested Brahmā for names and stations. Blessing him
by saying ‘mā ruda’ (do not cry) Brahmā allotted him
names and stations. He became famous by the name
Rudra. He was also given eleven more names by
Brahmā as follows: Manyu, Manu, Mahinasa, Mahān,
Śiva, Ṛtudhvaja, Ugraretas, Bhava, Kāma, Vāmadeva
and Dhṛtavrata. These names are otherwise famous as
follows: Aja, Ekapada, Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā, Rudra,
Hara, Śambhu, Tryambaka, Aparājita, Īśāna and Tri-
bhuvana. The eleven Rudras were also allotted the
following eleven positions by Brahmā i.e. heart, the five
organs of the body, vital force (Prāṇa) wind, fire,
water, earth, sun and moon. Rudra has eleven wives,
called Dhī, Vṛtti, Uśanā, Umā, Niyutā, Sarpis, Ilā, Amb-
ikā, Irāvatī, Sudhā and Dīkṣā. Rudra, under the name
Śiva, is considered to be the third of the trinity. The
doctrine is that as long as time is real, deluge, or annihi-
lation does not take place. Therefore, Rudrasaṃhāra
(annihilation by Rudra) may be taken to mean only as
the beginning of new creation.
<div n="NI"/>(v) At the commencement of Yuga (era) Brahmā was
born from the navel of Viṣṇu. Two asuras called Madhu
and Kaiṭabha rushed up to kill Brahmā, and from the
brow of Viṣṇu, who got angry towards the asuras was
born Śiva holding in his hands Śūla (the three-pronged
trident). (Vana Parva, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family life.%} Śiva has two wives, Gaṅgā and Pārvatī
(See under Gaṅgā and Pārvatī). He lodges Gaṅgā on
his head. Umā, Kātyāyanī, Gaurī, Kālī, Haimavatī
Īśvarī, Śivā, Bhavānī, Rudrāṇī, Śarvāṇī, Sarvamaṅgalā
Aparṇā, Pārvatī, Durgā, Mṛḍānī, Caṇḍikā, Ambikā,
Āryā, Dākṣāyaṇī, Girijā, Menakātmajā, Cāmuṇḍā,
Karṇamoṭī, Carcikā and Bhairavī—these are synonyms
of Pārvatī. Śiva lives on the top of the Mahāmeru,
where there are nine cities. At the centre is Brahmā's
[Page724-b+ 63]
Manovatī; exactly to the east of it is Indra's Amarāvatī;
at the south-eastern corner is Agni's Tejovatī; on the
south is Yama's Saṃyamanī; at the south-western
corner is Kṛṣṇāñjanā of Nirṛti, on the west is Varuṇa's
Śraddhāvatī, at the north-western corner is Gandha-
vatī of Vāyu, on the north is Kubera's Mahodayā, at
the north-eastern corner is Śiva's Yaśovatī—this is the
set of the nine cities.
<div n="NI"/>Two sons called Subrahmaṇya and Gaṇapati were born
to Śiva of Pārvatī, and they are his actual sons. Some
other sons also were born to him in his assumed forms
and by other women. Such have been Indrajit, Hanūmān
and others. For details see the respective words. (Devī
Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha, 9th Skandha; Kathāsarit-
sāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Incarnations.%} Śiva has taken several partial incar-
nations, the chief of which are given below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Durvāsas.%} (See under Durvāsas).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Vānara (Monkey).%} Śiva, Pārvatī and their attend-
ers like Nandikeśvara once transformed themselves into
monkeys and played about on the Himālayas. Rāvaṇa,
who came there on the occasion ridiculed Nandikeśvara,
who, in great rage, cursed Rāvaṇa that monkeys would
destroy him. Being thus cursed Rāvaṇa raised
Kailāsa from its foundations and played with it.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Śakti.%} Śiva incarnated himself as Śakti, son of
Vasiṣṭha and was devoured by Kalmāṣapāda, who
took the form of a Rākṣasa. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chap-
ter 6).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Varuṇa.%} Śiva once assumed the form of Varuṇa
and conducted a yajña which was attended by the
Vedas in assumed forms. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 85).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boons granted by Śiva.%} The Purāṇas refer to various
persons, who had earned boons from him and others
who attained heaven on account of their devotion for
him. The following are important among such persons.

Verse 69).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Assets of Śiva.%} Śiva possesses a mass of matted hair,
red in colour. It is known as Kaparda also, and hence
he is called Kapardī as well. Śiva is also stated to be
Agni. He has three eyes, the third one on the forehead
being all fire. Śiva is called Trinetra, Phālanetra,
Agnilocana etc. because of the above facts. It is only
just and proper that Śiva, who is the destroyer of all
things should have relation to Agni. Śiva, the all-
destroyer, carries the Śūla in his hands always. Another
weapon is named Pināka, and therefore Śiva is called
Pinākapāṇi (he who holds Pināka in his hands). Both
Śiva and his vehicle, the Bull, are white in colour. The
white colour indicates the justice observed in the
process of annihilation. Śiva has been described as
possessing two, four, eight and ten hands. Besides the
Pināka, he holds in his hands the club called Khaṭvāṅga,
the bow called Ajagava, a deer, beads, skull, ḍamaru
(a musical instrument) and many other sacred articles.
Gaṅgā and Candra (moon) dwell on his head, and he is,
therefore, known as Gaṅgādhara and Candracūḍa also.
A Garland made of human skulls adorns his neck. Śiva
wears the skin of the leopard for cloth and uses the skin
of the elephant for blanket. All over his limbs snakes
are worn as ornaments.
<div n="NI"/>The Purāṇas contain stories as to how Śiva earned most
of the above assets. The wives of many Ṛṣis felt ena-
moured of Śiva, who once appeared in the garb of a
beggar. The Ṛṣis, who got angry with Śiva on the
above account, decided to kill him. From the pit they
dug on the ground, a tiger emerged. Śiva killed it and
wore its skin. A deer followed the tiger from the pit.
Śiva held it in his left hand. The next to emerge out
of the pit was a red-hot iron rod. Śiva took it in his
hands as a weapon. Lastly snakes came out of the pit
and Śiva wore them on his body. On another occasion
an asura called Gaya assumed the form of an elephant
and chased the munis, who took refuge in a Śiva temple.
Śiva appeared, killed the elephant and wore its skin on
his body. Since Śiva wore snakes as ear-rings he came
to be known as Nāgakuṇḍala. Brahmā ordered that
Rudra should create people and accordingly he created
people. But, his creations were very cruel beings.
Brahmā feared that they would eat up the other creat-
ions. Brahmā, who trembled with fear, asked Rudra
to retire from the act of creation and to train himself
to do creation in the proper manner as ordained.
Accordingly, Rudra started practising tapas.
[Page725-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Incidents.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) How Śiva got the name Jīmūtaketu. (See under
Jīmūtaketu).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%He became Kapālī.%} (See under Kapālī).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Sin of Brahmahatyā on Śiva.%} As he plucked off the
head of Brahmā Śiva became subject to the sin of
Brahmahatyā. Blue in colour and with grey hair,
terrible Brahmahatyā approached Śiva who asked
her who she was and why she came. She ans-
wered that she was Brahmahatyā and asked Śiva to
take her into him. She entered his body so that he felt
a burning sensation all over him. In this condition Śiva
went to Bādaryāśrama. But, the great Ṛṣis, Naranārā-
yaṇas were not there in the āśrama. Sad at heart Śiva
went to the river Yamunā to take a bath. But the river
dried up. Then he went to Plakṣa island to bathe; but
the island disappeared. Then he went to Puṣkarā-
raṇya, Māgadhāraṇya, Saindhavāraṇya, Naimiṣāraṇya,
Dharmāraṇya etc. all to no purpose. He got worn out
but could not have a bath. The terrible Brahmahatyā
did not leave him. Though he visited sacred rivers,
āśramas and temples and practised Yoga, Śiva did not
get redemption from sin. At last, in great disappoint-
ment he went to Kurukṣetra, where he saw Viṣṇu. With
folded hands Śiva praised Viṣṇu who advised him the
following means for absolution from sin. “A Bhagavān
born from my aspect under the name Yogaśāyī is
living at Prayāga. The great river Varuṇā which has
started from the right leg of Yogaśāyī and which
redeems all sins as also the sublime river Asī, which has
started from his left leg are both worshipped by the whole
world. The temple of Yogaśāyī is at the centre of these
rivers, and that is a sacred place most important in the
three worlds and annihilative of all sins. That city is the
great Vārāṇasī. Even materialistic or worldly people
get salvation there. It is my (Viṣṇu) āśrama. There
dwells Sūrya called Lola destroying all sins. The place
where Keśava my aspect lives, is Daśāśvamedha. If you
go there you will get redemption from sin.”
<div n="NI"/>Thus directed by Viṣṇu Śiva went to Vārāṇasī and
achieved absolution from the sin of Brahmahatyā by
bathing in the holy tīrthas there. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Birth of Vīrabhadra.%} (See under Dakṣa),
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Water in Kālindī got dark in colour.%} (See under
Pārvatī, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Śiva became Nāgabhūṣaṇa.%} (See under Nāgāstram).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Blessed Sukeśa.%} Vidyutkeśa, the Rākṣasa married
Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of Sandhyā. While they toured
the world round enjoying their honeymoon Sālakaṭaṅkā
conceived and delivered in due course a son in the
valley of Mount Mandara. Śiva and Pārvatī, who pass-
ed that way in an aerial chariot saw the child and
came down to it. By the blessing of Śiva the child
grew up to a youth very quickly. Śiva named him
Sukeśa and after blessing that he would grow up to
become a pious soul disappeared from the scene.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Śiva, the father of Indrajit.%} (See under Indrajit,
Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) {%Four faces of Śiva.%} (See under Tilottamā, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(x) {%Sword of Śiva.%} Śiva holds a sword in his hand to
destroy the asura tribe. The following is told in
Chapter 166 of Śānti Parva about the origin of the
sword.
[Page726-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā when he created the universe also laid down
laws to keep living beings in the path of righteousness.
But, the asuras did not conform to those laws. So, the
maharṣis decided that there should be some other
means to instruct the asuras. They conducted a Brahma-
yajña at the Himālayas. A terrible Jin (Evil Spirit)
emerged from the sacrificial pit.
<div n="NI"/>At the emergence of the Jin the earth shook; the
great sea grew wild with waves and eddies. Lightning
and shooting stars appeared and branches of trees were
torn asunder. A vicious whirl-wind swept the ten
regions. All living beings trembled at the sight of the
Jin.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā appeared to the frightened maharṣis and told
them that it was not a Jin, but only the sword for
the destruction of the asura tribe. Śiva took the sword
in his hand, and as soon as he touched it he became
possessed of four hands. “Śiva, whose head touched
the sun, who had the third eye and from whose mouth
flames of fire emerged, who changed himself to various
colours like blue, white and red, who wore deer skin
with golden spots, who had on his forehead an eye as
effulgent as the Sun—such Śiva took in his hands the
fiery sword and raising his shield he swirled the sword
in various directions.”
<div n="NI"/>When Śiva, who thus became terrible, walked with the
sword amidst the asura army the entire asura forces
were annihilated and the Devas came out victorious.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Daring deeds of Śiva.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Clash With Viṣṇu.%} Though there were differences
of opinion between Śiva and Viṣṇu on many occasions,
only very rarely had occurred actual clashes between the
two. The Purāṇas refer to two such important clashes.
One has reference to a direct fight Śiva fought with
Viṣṇu and the other is about Śiva's fight with Nārāya-
ṇarṣi, an incarnation of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>There was no reason for the direct fight between Śiva
and Viṣṇu. The Devas wanted to test who was the
more powerful of the two, Śiva or Viṣṇu, and they told
Brahmā about the idea By carrying tales to them, one
against the other, Brahmā made Śiva and Viṣṇu mutual
enemies. The enmity led to a fight between the two.
Viśvakarman made a bow for each of the contestants.
In the fight between the two Śiva got defeated. Śiva,
who got angry at his temporary defeat presented his
bow and arrow to Devarāta, King of Videha. It was
this bow, which Śrī Rāma broke at the wedding of
Sītā in a later period. As soon as the fight was over
the Devas realised that Viṣṇu was greater than Śiva.
After the fight Viṣṇu gave his bow to Ṛcīka, the
Bhārgava muni. Jamadagni got it from Ṛcīka, and he
gave it to Paraśurāma. It was with this bow that
Paraśurāma confronted Śrī Rāma on his way back
after wedding Sītā. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
Canto 75).
<div n="NI"/>The following story is related in the Anuśāsana Parva
of Mahābhārata about the fight between Nārayaṇarṣi,
incarnation of Viṣṇu and Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva, in great fury, threw his Śūla into the Yajña hall
of Dakṣa, and the Śūla after reducing the Yajña, to
ashes, hit the breast of Nārāyaṇarṣi, who was doing
tapas in Badarikāśrama. Nārāyaṇa raised the sound
‘Hum’ as a result of which the Śūla returned to Śiva's
hands, who, in great anger, rushed forward to Nārāyaṇa.
Nārāyaṇa placed his hand on Śiva's throat with the result
[Page726-b+ 65]
that it became dark in colour. Thenceforth Śiva came
to be known as Śitikaṇṭha also.
<div n="NI"/>Nārāyaṇa plucked a blade of grass and recited some
mantras. It became a paraśu (axe). He threw it at
Śiva, who broke it into pieces, which act gave him the
additional name of Khaṇḍaparaśu also. The fighting
became fierce and the world began burning. Fire
refused to receive offerings made; Ṛṣis could not
recollect the Vedas; Rajas and Tamas attacked Devas;
the earth shook; planets became dim and dark;
Brahmā fell down from his seat; sky came down; oceans
got dry; the Himālayas crumbled. On the continuous
appearance of such ill omens Brahmā and all the
Devas came to the battlefield. Saluting Rudra Brahmā
told him thus: “Oh! Lord! Let good happen to the
world. In the interests of the welfare of the world. you
would please give up arms. The Naranārāyaṇas are
upholders of righteousness; they are the incarnations of
the indestructible and supreme sages. I was born from
their pleasure. You were born from their wrath.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing these words of Brahmā Śiva cooled down.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Rendered Kāmadeva bodiless (limbless).%} See under
Kāmadeva, Parva 4).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Bore Gaṅgā on the head.%} See under Gāṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Consumed Kālakūṭa.%} Owing to the curse of
Durvāsas the Devas were subjected to symptoms of
old age, and to produce amṛta (nectar) as remedy for
this unfortunate development, the churning of Kṣīrā-
bdhi (ocean of milk) was started. Vāsuki, the snake,
was used as cord to rotate mount Mandara, which
was used as the churning rod. When the churning
became very intense, the mortal poison Kālakūṭa emerg-
ed out of Vāsuki's mouth. (Another view is held that
Kālakūṭa rose out of the milk-sea). On the emergence of
the deadly poison the asuras ran off in great fear, the
Devas got bewildered, Bāli and Sugrīva too got fright-
ened; and without exhibiting his fright Viṣṇu covered
his face; on the whole it appeared as though the entire
world would be reduced to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>At this critical moment, Śiva, reputed for his reckless
daring, put all the Kālakūṭa into his mouth. Frightened
at it Pārvatī held Śiva's throat by her hands so that
the poison did not enter his stomach. At the same
time Mahāviṣṇu covered with his hands Śiva's mouth
so that the poison was not spitted out. Kālakūṭa thus
prevented from going down into the stomach or being
vomited from Śiva's throat got itself digested in the
throat giving it a blue colour. Thus did Śiva become
Nīlakaṇṭha (of the blue throat). Viṣṇu and Pārvatī
who were affected by the flames of the poison became
Nīlavarṇa and Kālī respectively. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddhakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Destroyed Dakṣa's yajña.%} See under Dakṣa Para 3).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Fought Śaṅkhacūḍa.%} (See under Tulasī, Para 5).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Burned the Tripuras.%} (See under Tripura).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Fought Sūrya.%} Śiva once plucked out Brahmā's head
(See under Kapālī 1), and Brahmā cursed Śiva that he
should beg for food with that head (skull) in his hands.
This fierce curse of Brahmā affected Śiva so much that,
in uncontrollable wrath, he beat whomsoever he met.
Thousands of Devas and others were killed. Sūrya, who
relished not these atrocities of Śiva confronted him with
out-stretched hands. Śiva held with one hand of his,
both the hands of Sūrya from the fingers of which
blood began to flow. Śiva turned Sūrya round and
[Page727-a+ 65]
round by his hands with the result that the hands of
Sūrya became short. When Sūrya became completely
drenched in blood Śiva let him free and walked to
another side when Sūrya, laughingly challenged him
again to fight. Greatly enraged by the challenge Śiva
fisted him on the face with the result he lost all his
teeth. Also he fell down unconscious. As Sūrya fell
thus Bhaga looked with fierce eyes at Śiva, who then
struck the former on his face, Both the eyes of Bhaga
fell down and the Devas were alarmed by it. Then all
the Ādityas, under the leadership of Indra ran off to the
ten regions along with the Maruts and Agni. Only
prominent asuras like Prahlāda remained on the scene.
They saluted Śiva. Śiva surveyed the yāga hall, the
Devas and the asuras with his three eyes. All of them
then ran away to different places. Śiva looked at the
three Agnis with his three eyes and they were reduced
to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>When Śiva's anger subsided Sūrya was installed in his
former form. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) {%Fought with Andhaka.%} See under Andhaka.
<div n="NI"/>(x) {%Made five Indras Pāṇḍavas.%} The Pāṇḍavas, in their
former life, were Indras. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 199).
<div n="NI"/>The Devas once conducted at Naimisāraṇya a lengthy
yajña of which Yama was the manager. In the absence
of Yama there was no death on earth. Thus, human
beings also, like the Devas, became Amartyas (death-
less). Alarmed at this the Devas submitted their
grievance to Brahmā who pacified them by saying that
Yama would return as soon as the yajña was over and
then men will, as usual be subjected to the process of
death. The Devas then returned to Naimiṣāraṇya,
the scene of their yajña when they saw a woman,
lustrous as fire, descending the steps of Gaṅgā to
carry water. She was sobbing and each drop of tear
that fell into the waters of the river transformed itself
into a lotus flower. As deputed by the Devas Indra
approached the woman to get facts from her.
<div n="NI"/>Indra asked her who she was and why she was weeping.
The woman answered him not, but walked in silence,
to the source of the Gaṅgā. Indra followed her. When
they had thus walked some distance Śiva and Pārvatī
were found in the forest at a game of dice, and Indra,
afraid of Śiva, ran way. But, Śiva called him back and
asked him to enter the cave there. When Indra did so
after removing the mountain at the entrance of the cave
he saw four Indras sitting there. They were called
Viśvabhuk, Bhūtadhāmā, Śibi and Śānti. The woman
whom Indra had followed was Śrīdevī. Śiva blessed that
the five Indras, in their next birth, would wed Śrīdevī.
When the Indras saw Mahāviṣṇu after this he also
blessed them, and promised them that he would incar-
nate and help them when they were born as men in
their next life. Then Viṣṇu plucked a black and a
white hair and put them on earth. The black hair
was born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Devakī's womb and the white
hair as Balabhadrarāma in the womb of Rohīṇī.
<div n="NI"/>(xi) {%Kirātārjunīyam.%} Arjuna once did tapas to Śiva, who
appeared to him in the garb of a hunter in the forest
and presented to him the Pāśupata arrow. (For details
see under Arjuna, Para 20).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) {%Fought with Mahiṣāsura.%} (See under Mahiṣāsura).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) {%Fought with Vṛtrāsura.%} See under Vṛtrāsura.
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) {%Burnt Himavān.%} Śiva once did tapas on the top of
Himavān when Pārvatī came behind him and covered
[Page727-b+ 65]
his eyes with her hands. At once darkness enveloped
the whole world, and when people suffered in the
absence of day-light Śiva opened his third eye.
Himavān began getting burnt by the fire emitted by
Śiva's eye. Pārvatī got alarmed at this and woke Śiva
up. He closed his third eye and Himavān resumed its
former shape. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 104).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Worship of Śiva.%} Innumerable people in India
worship Śiva and they follow different forms or systems
of worship. There are forms of worship which follow
the Vedas and which do not as also forms which are
sāttvic and which are not. The form of worship called
Paraśupadam (? Pāśupatam) is a very ancient one. It is
believed that the Paraśupadas once honoured and after-
wards opposed the Vedas. The Śiva liṅga at the place
called Gūḍamillam is supposed to be as old as the
second century B.C.
<div n="NI"/>One of the many symbols, which represent Śiva, Śivaliṅga
is the most important. They are of two kinds, the
movable and the immovable. The immovable are those
which appear by themselves or installed in temples. The
movable are those made of earth, stone, timber, gems
etc. There are also temporary liṅgas, which are placed
on stools of various shapes. Liṅgas are made of he-stones
and stools of ‘she-stones’.
<div n="NI"/>There are also various types of liṅgas indicative of the
different attributes of Śiva; for example Liṅgodbhava,
Candrasekhara, Raudra, Umāsahita etc. Kāmāntaka,
Gajāri, Kālāri, Tripuradāhaka etc. represent the Lord
in his fierce aspects. Śiva is also represented in poses of
blessing Caṇḍeśa, Viṣṇu, Nandīśvara, Vighneśvara and
Arjuna. He is also presented in various poses of dancing,
Dakṣiṇāmūrti is represented in four forms, i.e. Vyākhyāna
Jñāna, Yoga and Vīṇādhara. Bikṣāṭaka, Kapāladhārī.
Gaṅgādhara, Ardhanārīśvara Vṛṣabhavāhana and
Viṣabhakṣaka are other forms of Śiva. Rarely is he depict-
ed in the form of Sadāśiva, Maheśvara, Ekādaśarudras
Vidyeśvara and Mūrtyaṣṭaka. There are Āgamas descrip-
tive of these forms.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇapati occupies the most prominent place among
Devas connected with Śiva. Gaṇapati came to be wor-
shipped from 6-7 centuries B.C. His present idols might
have been made after this period.
<div n="NI"/>There are many temples dedicated to Gaṇapati in South
India. Chief among the idols are iṭaṃpiri (proboscis
turned to the left side) and valaṃpiri (proboscis turned
to the right side). Gaṇapati is a physical aspect of
Śiva. Being the God who removes obstacles in the
devotee's path, Gaṇapati is called Vighneśvara. The
universe is contained in his big stomach.
<div n="NI"/>Next to Gaṇapati in importance is Subrahmaṇya. He
is worshipped in South India only. Kumāra, Muruka,
Kārttikeya, Skanda, Ārumukha, Guha, etc. are some of
his popular synonyms There are a number of Subrah-
maṇya temples in Tamil Nāḍu, many of them on the
tops of hills. In North India Subrahmaṇya temples are
rare. But, books written during the Saṅgha period go
to prove that Subrahmaṇya was worshipped in South
India from very olden times. He is depicted in many
postures, sitting, with six faces, with only one face, with
two hands, with four hands, with wife, wearing the
sacred thread etc.
<div n="NI"/>Now, about Śakti idols. Śakti is the Devī closest to Śiva.
In South India there are special Śakti temples called
Śaktipīṭhālayas. Durgā is the most important among
[Page728-a+ 65]
the manifestations of Śakti. There are idols of Durgās
as standing in the lotus flower and also as mounted on
the lion. Āgamas refer to nine kinds or forms of Durgā
i.e. Nīlakaṇṭhī, Kṣemaṅkarī, Harasiddhi, Raudrā, Vanā,
Agni, Jayā, Vindhyavāsinī, and Ripunāśinī. Durgā's
most terrible form is as Mahiṣāsura-mardinī, found at
Mahābalipuram, Ellora and other places. Durgā is also
called Caṇḍikā and Kātyāyanī. Durgā is worshipped as
Nandā, Bhadrakālī, Ambā, Rājamātaṅgī etc.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śiva's life-period.%} Thousand Caturyugas constitute
one day of Brahmā. According to the Purāṇas fourteen
Indras fall dead from heaven during the life time of one
Brahmā. Two such life times of Brahmā form one life
time of Viṣṇu; at the end of the period he too will
expire. Śiva's life time is double that of Viṣṇu, accord-
ing to Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha. (For details see
under Manvantara).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Śiva and creation of the universe.%} See under Creation).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Māyā Śiva.%} (See under Māyā śiva).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Sahasranāmas (thousand names) of Śiva.%} The thousand
names of Śiva are mentioned mainly in Chapter 285 of
Śānti Parva and Chapter 17 of Anuśāsana Parva of
Mahābhārata. There are substantial differences between
the two lists of names.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Aśvatthāmā and Śiva.%} (See under Aśvatthāmā
Para 6).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Rudras.%} The Ekādaśarudras, viz. Mṛgavyādha,
Sarpa, Nirṛti, Ajaikapāt, Ahirbudhnya, Pinākī, Īśvara,
Kapālī, Sthāṇu and Bharga are the sons of Śiva. (Ādi
Parva, Chapter 66).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Śivabhasma (Ashes worn by Śiva)%} The Purāṇas
contain many references to the great power of Śivabha-
sman. The following story about even Viṣṇu turning
out to be a devotee of Śiva on account of the sanctity of
Śivabhasma is related in Chapter 101, Pātālakhaṇḍa of
Padma Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning or during the Brahmapralaya (deluge)
Mahāviṣṇu was lying in the great waters of the deluge.
On both sides of Viṣṇu hundred universes each and on
both sides of his feet and at the centre of his head twenty
universes each remained attached. One universe glowed
as a gem on Viṣṇu's nose. Maharṣis like Lomaśa did
tapas seated on his navel. Meanwhile Viṣṇu sat in deep
meditation ready for creation. But, he did not find
anything and began, therefore, sobbing. Then appeared
an extra-mundane light at which he got frightened and
closed his eyes. Śiva, rotating in both his hands a
garland each made of a crore of universes appeared
before Viṣṇu. He then stood up and enquired of the
visitor who he was. Śiva exhibited his form. Śiva told
Viṣṇu that he had not attained sufficient wisdom for
creation and also advised him to achieve enough know-
ledge by first taking the Varuṇa bath and then the
Bhasma bath.
<div n="NI"/>To this Viṣṇu answered by saying that there was no-
where water enough for him to bathe, and he, who was
closely surrounded by universes, sat in water. But, it
came only up to his thighs. Then Śiva said laughingly
that there was enough water for Viṣṇu to bathe and
cast a glance at him with his (Śiva) eye on the fore-
head and also his left eye. And, immediately Viṣṇu's
body became very small and it began to shiver. Then
Śiva said as follows:-“Oh! Viṣṇu! here is deep water.
you may bathe in it. But Viṣṇu could not get into the
tremendous pool created on Śiva's lap. So, he requested
[Page728-b+ 65]
Śiva for a passage to get into the pool. Śiva “Oh!
Viṣṇu! Before this even though you sat in water, one
crore yojanas in depth, it came only up to your thighs.
But, now though you are on your legs you say you can-
not enter the water. Look here, the water comes only
up to my thighs. You may descend into it. I shall see
to it that you can step into the water. A Vedic saying
I recite will serve as the step.”
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu:—Nobody can step on sound. One may ascend
on what is material, i.e. with form; but, how could one
step on that which is formless?
<div n="NI"/>Śiva:—Why can you not get hold of that which is and
ascend? You receive this great Veda.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu received it, but it appeared that his hands were
not strong enough to hold it. Śiva smiled at the inabili-
ty of Viṣṇu and asked him to get down into water by
the steps made of Veda and when Viṣṇu descended the
steps into the water, it came only up to his thighs. He
had his bath and then asked Śiva what he should do
next. Śiva:—“What do you feel in your mind? Is it
that you do not feel anything”
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu:—I feel not anything.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva:—If you get sanctified by bhasmasnāna you will
receive the ultimate knowledge. I shall give you the
bhasma.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva took a pinch of bhasma from his breast and chant-
ing the Gāyatrī and pañcākṣara (Om namaśśivāya)
mantras sprinkled it all over the body of Viṣṇu. He
also said to Viṣṇu, “You live, you meditate, now what
do you feel in your mind?” Viṣṇu meditated whereupon
he saw a very bright light in his heart. When he told
Śiva that a light was being seen by him the latter
said that his knowledge was not mature enough and
asked him to eat some bhasma so that it might become
perfect. Viṣṇu accordingly consumed the bhasma, and
lo! he, who was till then red-blue in colour became
as white as pearl. He began to be called Śuklavarṇa
(white in colour) from that day onwards.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu felt happy and contented having seen Śiva,
who asked the former what it was he saw in his mind
just then. Answering that he saw the blissful form of
Śiva before him Viṣṇu fell at the latter's feet. To Śiva's
query as to what boon he desired to have, Viṣṇu replied
that he wanted to become a devotee of Śiva and because
of the greatness of the bhasma Viṣṇu thenceforward
became a devotee of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Śivaliṅga (Phallus).%} Worship of Śivaliṅga is a
popular practice in India. The Purāṇas contain a
number of stories about the importance Sivaliṅga
achieved so as to make it an object of worship. Three
of the more important stories are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Śiva wandered about the world lamenting over the
death of Satīdevī at the Yajña conducted by Dakṣa,
and Kāmadeva followed him with his erotic arrows to
exploit Śiva's sorry predicament. During his wanderings
Śiva once came to the Vindhya mountain. Kāmadeva
followed him there too and began attacking Śiva with
his arrows and to escape from the fierce onslaught Śiva
took refuge in the terrible Dāru forest. There Mahar-
ṣis with their wives lived. Śiva saluted them and re-
quested for alms. But, the Maharṣis only kept mum. They
did not like their wives saluting Śiva. Śiva went about
the ā rama and all the women except Arundhatī and
Anasūyā, followed him overcome by lust for him.
Enraged at this, munis like Bhārgava and Aṅgiras cursed
[Page729-a+ 65]
Śiva that his phallus should drop to the ground. Immedi-
ately it fell down and Śiva disappeared. The phallus
rent asunder the earth, reached Pātāla and rent the
universe also. The whole universe shook at which
Brahmā met Viṣṇu at Pātāla and enquired of him the
reason for the universal upheaval. Viṣṇu answered him
that the world shook because of the weight of Śiva's
phallus, which the maharṣis had caused to be dropped.
Then Brahmā, along with Viṣṇu, came to the spot
where Śiva's phallus lay. At the sight of the limitless
phallus Viṣṇu, in great wonder, descended to Pātāla
mounted on Garuḍa. Brahmā, on his plane, toured
above. Both Viṣṇu and Brahmā returned to earth,
having failed in their attempt to find the end of the
phallus. They then praised Śiva, who appeared to them.
They requested him to take back his phallus from the
earth. Śiva insisted that he would do so only if the
Devas agreed to worship his phallus. Viṣṇu agreed to
the suggestion. Brahmā took the phallus, golden
brassy in colour. Thereafter Mahāviṣṇu created
the four castes and various śāstraic texts for each of the
castes to worship the phallus. The four texts are known
as Śaivam, Pāśupatam, Kāladamanam and Kāpālikam.
After making the above arrangements Brahmā and
Viṣṇu returned. Śiva took back his phallus. (Vāmana
Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Eightyeight thousand Bālakhilyas were born from
the mind of Brahmā. They emaciated their bodies by
constant baths, fasting and worship of Śiva. Though
they worshipped Śiva thus for one thousand divya years,
he did not appear in front of them.
<div n="NI"/>Afterwards, when Pārvatī was travelling by sky one day,
the latter saw and took pity on the Bālakhilyas and told
Śiva thus: “These maharṣis are suffering like anything.
For my sake, you should put an end to their sufferings.
Has their evil fate no end? They are reduced to mere
skin and bones, and yet they are denied realisation.”
Smilingly Śiva told Pārvatī as follows “You do not know
the real course of righteousness. These people do not
understand righteousness; they are not free from lust
and anger. They are mere fools.” At these words of
Śiva, Pārvatī told him thus: If things be as you have
said please show me their nature, I feel interested. Then
Śiva asked Pārvatī to remain where she was, telling her
that he would go to the Bālakhilyas and show her how
they behaved. Accordingly Śiva went to them.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva approached the Bālakhilyas in the guise of a hand-
some youth, wearing the Vanamālā garland on his
head, holding the alms bowl in his hands and complete-
ly in the nude and requested for alms. The Women-
folk of the Advaitins were much attracted by the hand-
some youth and came to him with a lot of fruits, roots
etc. by way of alms. Śiva wished them good and
Pārvatī espied her smiling lord from her seat.
<div n="NI"/>After giving him alms the women spoke to him as
follows: “Oh! anchorite, what penance are you
practising? You have no clothes on you, but you wear
Vanamālā. You are a handsome sannyāsī. If you
have no objection, please tell us about you.” The
sannyāsī (Śiva) answered them by saying that his was
a very secret penance and could not be imparted to
others. Especially in the presence of so many others it
could not be revealed. So, you may please go. But,
the women said that they wished very much to hear the
secret, and they caught hold of his hands saying ‘Come’.
[Page729-b+ 65]
The women were overcome by lust and one of them
caught hold of his neck, another of his hands, another
of his knees, another of his hair and yet another of his
waist. Seeing the excitement of their wives the mahar-
ṣis cried, ‘Strike him’ and struck down his phallus
with sticks and stones. As soon as the phallus was
thus felled down, Śiva disappeared from the spot and
returned to Kailāsa with Pārvatī.
<div n="NI"/>When the phallus fell down the whole universe shook
and the maharṣis were alarmed. A very intelligent
maharṣi among them said:—“We know not the real
facts about the great ascetic. Let us take refuge in
Brahmā. He may know the facts.” Accordingly the
maharṣis went to Brahmā, who found fault with their
ignorance and indiscretion and asked them to shed
their anger and please Śiva. Accordingly they went to
Kailāsa and praised Śiva, who appeared to them and
told them as follows:—“You may now return. The
phallus will belong to you. I shall be pleased if you
would duly install it. Nothing will be impossible
to those who worship my phallus with devotion. Even
sins consciously committed will be removed by the
worship of my phallus. You install the phallus you
struck down in the great pond of Sannihita. That
will achieve for you all your desires. Even the Devas
will worship it under the name ‘Sthāṇu’. Being install-
ed at Sthāṇvīśvara it will be known as Sthāṇvīśvara
also. Constant meditation upon Sthāṇu will remove
all sins. The sight of Sthāṇu will bring about salva-
tion.”
<div n="NI"/>After this the maharṣis, along with Brahmā, returned
to Dāru forest to carry the phallus to Sannihita. But,
they could not move it even by an iota. They returned
again to Kailāsa, but could not see Śiva there. When
Brahmā sat in meditation for sometime to know where
Śiva was, he saw in his mind Śiva, in the guise of an
elephant, standing in the stream praised by munis.
Immediately Brahmā and others went there, but missed
Śiva there. But Pārvatī appeared there and served
them amṛta (nectar). When they had consumed the
nectar they saw Śiva standing in the stream, and they
spoke about their difficulties to him.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva, in the guise of the elephant, accompanied them to
the Dāru forest where he, in sport, took the phallus
by his proboscis and installed it on the banks of
the stream. All those who witnessed the installa-
tion attained ultimate realisation. Upon the phallus
thus installed Brahmā built another phallus with stone.
After a period that phallus became one with the
effulgence of the first phallus. Those who saw that also
achieved ultimate realisation. Immediately Brahmā
built, for the pleasure of the Devas, seven phalluses
one upon the other, and sages attained ultimate realis-
ation by smearing their bodies with the dust of the
phalluses. The spot where the phallus was installed
became famous by the name Sthāṇutīrtha. (Vāmana
Purāṇa, Chapter 45).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In the beginning Brahmā entrusted Śiva with
the duty of creation and to earn the power for creation
he lived under water for many generations. Śiva
having not returned though Brahmā waited for him
long, the latter created the prajāpatis and got done by
them all creations. Then it was that Śiva, having
acquired all the more power, came out of water. Śiva
who got angry that all creations were effected in his
[Page730-a+ 65]
absence plucked his phallus and threw it into the
earth. He said that, since matters of creation had been
managed by Brahmā, he needed the phallus no further.
The phallus thus thrown by Śiva stuck to the earth
and remained pointed upwards. Next, Śiva performed a
dance of annihilation among the Devas. Ultimately, on
the request of the Devas Śiva deposited his fire of wrath
in water. It is that fire which dries up water in seas,
rivers etc. When Śiva had shed his anger and become
quiet the Devas worshipped the phallus, which had
stuck to the earth, and thenceforth worship of Śiva's
phallus became popular. (M.B. Sauptika Parva, Chap-
ter 17).

<div n="NI"/>18) {%Bull of Śiva.%} Cows were born on earth from
Surabhi. The foam of milk which flowed like sea
from cows rose into waves and fell in Śivabhūmi (Śiva
land). Śiva did not like it. He opened his third eye
and looked at the cows. The flames from the eye
caused different colours to the cows. The cows took
refuge with Candra. But, the fire of Śiva's eye followed
the cows there also. At last the Prajāpatis pacified
Śiva and presented him a bull for vehicle. From that
day onwards Śiva came to be known as Vṛṣabhavāhana
and Vṛṣabhāṅka also. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 77).

<div n="NI"/>(xi) There is a story in Śānti Parva of Mahābhārata
about Śiva's bringing back to life the dead child of a
brahmin. The story was told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira.
The brahmin took his dead child to the burning ghat
when a fox asked him to wait at least till dusk to see
if the child would regain life. At the same time a
vulture, which came there pointed out to the brahmin
that the dead never came back to life and asked him to
leave the dead body there and return home. As advised
by the fox and the vulture the brahmin took to the
burning ghat and took back from there the dead body
of his child. Pārvatī took pity on the brahmin and as
requested by her Śiva brought the child back to life.
The logic and reasoning advanced by the fox and the
[Page731-a+ 65]
vulture for their selfish ends is famous under the name
Gṛdhragomāyusaṃvāda.
