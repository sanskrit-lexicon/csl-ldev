ŚIVA¦ (RUDRA). One of the Trinity.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The seers or spiritual giants of India imagined
<div n="lb"/>three forms to God, dividing all the activities into three
<div n="lb"/>departments, i.e. creation, sustenance and destruction or
<div n="lb"/>annihilation. Brahmā, for creation, Viṣṇu, for susten-
<div n="lb"/>ance and Śiva, for annihilation-they are the Trinity.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu was born first, Brahmā next and Śiva last. The
<div n="lb"/>essence of Indian spiritualistic thought is that these three
<div n="lb"/>visible forms of God will, at the close of the Kalpa
<div n="lb"/>cease to be and become one with the cosmic power, and
<div n="lb"/>that the trinity will be born again at the commence-
<div n="lb"/>ment of the Kalpa and will take up their respective
<div n="lb"/>functions.
<div n="NI"/>The dominant quality or attribute of Śiva is Tamas
<div n="lb"/>(darkness). Many stories, with slight variations, are told
<div n="lb"/>in the various Purāṇas about the birth of Śiva. Some
<div n="lb"/>of the more important stories are summarised below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) At the beginning of the Kalpa, while Brahmā was
<div n="lb"/>meditating upon the birth of a son like himself, a child
<div n="lb"/>deep blue in colour, appeared on his lap, and the child
<div n="lb"/>began running about crying aloud. Brahmā asked the
<div n="lb"/>child why it was crying; then the child asked Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>to give him a name. Though Brahmā told him that
<div n="lb"/>his name was Rudra and asked him not to cry, he
<div n="lb"/>cried seven times more. Then Brahmā gave him another
[Page724-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>seven names, and for the total eight names eight
<div n="lb"/>Mūrtis (forms) wives and children were allotted. Bhava,
<div n="lb"/>Śarva, Īśāna, Paśupati, Bhīma, Ugra and Mahādeva
<div n="lb"/>were the additional seven names, and Sun, Water,
<div n="lb"/>Earth, Wind, Fire, Sky, the Brahmin who has taken
<div n="lb"/>dīkṣā and Moon were the eight Mūrtis and the presiding
<div n="lb"/>deities allotted to them. To these deities the following
<div n="lb"/>wives were also allotted, i.e. Suvarcalā, Uṣā, Vikeśī, Śivā,
<div n="lb"/>Svāhā, Diśā, Dīkṣā and Rohiṇī. The world is full with
<div n="lb"/>their progenies. Śanaiścara, Śukra, Lohitāṅga, Mano-
<div n="lb"/>java, Skanda, Sarga, Santāna and Budha are the sons of
<div n="lb"/>the above eight wives. This Rudra married Satī, daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter of Dakṣaprajāpati. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Brahmā whose predominant quality or attribute
<div n="lb"/>is rajas was born from the navel of Mahāviṣṇu. From
<div n="lb"/>the Centre of the brow of Brahmā was born Rudra of
<div n="lb"/>Tāmasic quality. Brahmā, by the power of his tapas,
<div n="lb"/>acquired the power of creation and created a red-col-
<div n="lb"/>oured world by his attribute of rajas. The very same
<div n="lb"/>world is annihilated by Rudra at the close of the Kalpa
<div n="lb"/>period. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) From the wrath of Brahmā was born Rudra, from
<div n="lb"/>his lap Nārada, from his finger Dakṣa, from his mind
<div n="lb"/>Sanaka and others, and from his left finger a daughter
<div n="lb"/>called Vīraṇī. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Four ‘mental sons’ of Brahmā Sanaka, Sanandana
<div n="lb"/>Sanātana and Sanatkumāra showed disinclination to
<div n="lb"/>beget progenies. Brahmā got angry at this attitude of
<div n="lb"/>the four sons and from the centre of his brow was born
<div n="lb"/>a body blue and white in colour, and he, in tears,
<div n="lb"/>requested Brahmā for names and stations. Blessing him
<div n="lb"/>by saying ‘mā ruda’ (do not cry) Brahmā allotted him
<div n="lb"/>names and stations. He became famous by the name
<div n="lb"/>Rudra. He was also given eleven more names by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā as follows: Manyu, Manu, Mahinasa, Mahān,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, Ṛtudhvaja, Ugraretas, Bhava, Kāma, Vāmadeva
<div n="lb"/>and Dhṛtavrata. These names are otherwise famous as
<div n="lb"/>follows: Aja, Ekapada, Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā, Rudra,
<div n="lb"/>Hara, Śambhu, Tryambaka, Aparājita, Īśāna and Tri-
<div n="lb"/>bhuvana. The eleven Rudras were also allotted the
<div n="lb"/>following eleven positions by Brahmā i.e. heart, the five
<div n="lb"/>organs of the body, vital force (Prāṇa) wind, fire,
<div n="lb"/>water, earth, sun and moon. Rudra has eleven wives,
<div n="lb"/>called Dhī, Vṛtti, Uśanā, Umā, Niyutā, Sarpis, Ilā, Amb-
<div n="lb"/>ikā, Irāvatī, Sudhā and Dīkṣā. Rudra, under the name
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, is considered to be the third of the trinity. The
<div n="lb"/>doctrine is that as long as time is real, deluge, or annihi-
<div n="lb"/>lation does not take place. Therefore, Rudrasaṃhāra
<div n="lb"/>(annihilation by Rudra) may be taken to mean only as
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of new creation.
<div n="NI"/>(v) At the commencement of Yuga (era) Brahmā was
<div n="lb"/>born from the navel of Viṣṇu. Two asuras called Madhu
<div n="lb"/>and Kaiṭabha rushed up to kill Brahmā, and from the
<div n="lb"/>brow of Viṣṇu, who got angry towards the asuras was
<div n="lb"/>born Śiva holding in his hands Śūla (the three-pronged
<div n="lb"/>trident). (Vana Parva, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family life.%} Śiva has two wives, Gaṅgā and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>(See under Gaṅgā and Pārvatī). He lodges Gaṅgā on
<div n="lb"/>his head. Umā, Kātyāyanī, Gaurī, Kālī, Haimavatī
<div n="lb"/>Īśvarī, Śivā, Bhavānī, Rudrāṇī, Śarvāṇī, Sarvamaṅgalā
<div n="lb"/>Aparṇā, Pārvatī, Durgā, Mṛḍānī, Caṇḍikā, Ambikā,
<div n="lb"/>Āryā, Dākṣāyaṇī, Girijā, Menakātmajā, Cāmuṇḍā,
<div n="lb"/>Karṇamoṭī, Carcikā and Bhairavī—these are synonyms
<div n="lb"/>of Pārvatī. Śiva lives on the top of the Mahāmeru,
<div n="lb"/>where there are nine cities. At the centre is Brahmā's
[Page724-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Manovatī; exactly to the east of it is Indra's Amarāvatī;
<div n="lb"/>at the south-eastern corner is Agni's Tejovatī; on the
<div n="lb"/>south is Yama's Saṃyamanī; at the south-western
<div n="lb"/>corner is Kṛṣṇāñjanā of Nirṛti, on the west is Varuṇa's
<div n="lb"/>Śraddhāvatī, at the north-western corner is Gandha-
<div n="lb"/>vatī of Vāyu, on the north is Kubera's Mahodayā, at
<div n="lb"/>the north-eastern corner is Śiva's Yaśovatī—this is the
<div n="lb"/>set of the nine cities.
<div n="NI"/>Two sons called Subrahmaṇya and Gaṇapati were born
<div n="lb"/>to Śiva of Pārvatī, and they are his actual sons. Some
<div n="lb"/>other sons also were born to him in his assumed forms
<div n="lb"/>and by other women. Such have been Indrajit, Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>and others. For details see the respective words. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha, 9th Skandha; Kathāsarit-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Incarnations.%} Śiva has taken several partial incar-
<div n="lb"/>nations, the chief of which are given below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Durvāsas.%} (See under Durvāsas).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Vānara (Monkey).%} Śiva, Pārvatī and their attend-
<div n="lb"/>ers like Nandikeśvara once transformed themselves into
<div n="lb"/>monkeys and played about on the Himālayas. Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>who came there on the occasion ridiculed Nandikeśvara,
<div n="lb"/>who, in great rage, cursed Rāvaṇa that monkeys would
<div n="lb"/>destroy him. Being thus cursed Rāvaṇa raised
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa from its foundations and played with it.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Śakti.%} Śiva incarnated himself as Śakti, son of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and was devoured by Kalmāṣapāda, who
<div n="lb"/>took the form of a Rākṣasa. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 6).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Varuṇa.%} Śiva once assumed the form of Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>and conducted a yajña which was attended by the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas in assumed forms. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 85).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boons granted by Śiva.%} The Purāṇas refer to various
<div n="lb"/>persons, who had earned boons from him and others
<div n="lb"/>who attained heaven on account of their devotion for
<div n="lb"/>him. The following are important among such persons.

<div n="lb"/>Verse 64).
<div n="NI"/>(xv) Bāṇāsura—(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 33,
<div n="lb"/>Southern text).
<div n="NI"/>(xvi) Maṅkaṇa—(Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Verse
<div n="lb"/>132).
<div n="NI"/>(xvii) Sagara—(Vana Parva, Chapter 106, Verse 15)
[Page725-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(xviii) Bhagīratha—(Vana Parva, Chapter 109,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 1).
<div n="NI"/>(xix) Jayadratha—(Vana Parva, Chapter 272, Verse
<div n="lb"/>28).
<div n="NI"/>(xx) Ambā—(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 187, Verse 12).
<div n="NI"/>(xxi) Somadatta—(Droṇa Parva, Chapter 143, Verse

<div n="NI"/>(xxvi) A Brahmin boy—(Śānti Parva, Chapter 153,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 114).
<div n="NI"/>(xxvii) Taṇḍi muni—(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 16,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 69).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Assets of Śiva.%} Śiva possesses a mass of matted hair,
<div n="lb"/>red in colour. It is known as Kaparda also, and hence
<div n="lb"/>he is called Kapardī as well. Śiva is also stated to be
<div n="lb"/>Agni. He has three eyes, the third one on the forehead
<div n="lb"/>being all fire. Śiva is called Trinetra, Phālanetra,
<div n="lb"/>Agnilocana etc. because of the above facts. It is only
<div n="lb"/>just and proper that Śiva, who is the destroyer of all
<div n="lb"/>things should have relation to Agni. Śiva, the all-
<div n="lb"/>destroyer, carries the Śūla in his hands always. Another
<div n="lb"/>weapon is named Pināka, and therefore Śiva is called
<div n="lb"/>Pinākapāṇi (he who holds Pināka in his hands). Both
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and his vehicle, the Bull, are white in colour. The
<div n="lb"/>white colour indicates the justice observed in the
<div n="lb"/>process of annihilation. Śiva has been described as
<div n="lb"/>possessing two, four, eight and ten hands. Besides the
<div n="lb"/>Pināka, he holds in his hands the club called Khaṭvāṅga,
<div n="lb"/>the bow called Ajagava, a deer, beads, skull, ḍamaru
<div n="lb"/>(a musical instrument) and many other sacred articles.
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Candra (moon) dwell on his head, and he is,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, known as Gaṅgādhara and Candracūḍa also.
<div n="lb"/>A Garland made of human skulls adorns his neck. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>wears the skin of the leopard for cloth and uses the skin
<div n="lb"/>of the elephant for blanket. All over his limbs snakes
<div n="lb"/>are worn as ornaments.
<div n="NI"/>The Purāṇas contain stories as to how Śiva earned most
<div n="lb"/>of the above assets. The wives of many Ṛṣis felt ena-
<div n="lb"/>moured of Śiva, who once appeared in the garb of a
<div n="lb"/>beggar. The Ṛṣis, who got angry with Śiva on the
<div n="lb"/>above account, decided to kill him. From the pit they
<div n="lb"/>dug on the ground, a tiger emerged. Śiva killed it and
<div n="lb"/>wore its skin. A deer followed the tiger from the pit.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva held it in his left hand. The next to emerge out
<div n="lb"/>of the pit was a red-hot iron rod. Śiva took it in his
<div n="lb"/>hands as a weapon. Lastly snakes came out of the pit
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva wore them on his body. On another occasion
<div n="lb"/>an asura called Gaya assumed the form of an elephant
<div n="lb"/>and chased the munis, who took refuge in a Śiva temple.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva appeared, killed the elephant and wore its skin on
<div n="lb"/>his body. Since Śiva wore snakes as ear-rings he came
<div n="lb"/>to be known as Nāgakuṇḍala. Brahmā ordered that
<div n="lb"/>Rudra should create people and accordingly he created
<div n="lb"/>people. But, his creations were very cruel beings.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā feared that they would eat up the other creat-
<div n="lb"/>ions. Brahmā, who trembled with fear, asked Rudra
<div n="lb"/>to retire from the act of creation and to train himself
<div n="lb"/>to do creation in the proper manner as ordained.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly, Rudra started practising tapas.
[Page725-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Incidents.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) How Śiva got the name Jīmūtaketu. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtaketu).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%He became Kapālī.%} (See under Kapālī).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Sin of Brahmahatyā on Śiva.%} As he plucked off the
<div n="lb"/>head of Brahmā Śiva became subject to the sin of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmahatyā. Blue in colour and with grey hair,
<div n="lb"/>terrible Brahmahatyā approached Śiva who asked
<div n="lb"/>her who she was and why she came. She ans-
<div n="lb"/>wered that she was Brahmahatyā and asked Śiva to
<div n="lb"/>take her into him. She entered his body so that he felt
<div n="lb"/>a burning sensation all over him. In this condition Śiva
<div n="lb"/>went to Bādaryāśrama. But, the great Ṛṣis, Naranārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇas were not there in the āśrama. Sad at heart Śiva
<div n="lb"/>went to the river Yamunā to take a bath. But the river
<div n="lb"/>dried up. Then he went to Plakṣa island to bathe; but
<div n="lb"/>the island disappeared. Then he went to Puṣkarā-
<div n="lb"/>raṇya, Māgadhāraṇya, Saindhavāraṇya, Naimiṣāraṇya,
<div n="lb"/>Dharmāraṇya etc. all to no purpose. He got worn out
<div n="lb"/>but could not have a bath. The terrible Brahmahatyā
<div n="lb"/>did not leave him. Though he visited sacred rivers,
<div n="lb"/>āśramas and temples and practised Yoga, Śiva did not
<div n="lb"/>get redemption from sin. At last, in great disappoint-
<div n="lb"/>ment he went to Kurukṣetra, where he saw Viṣṇu. With
<div n="lb"/>folded hands Śiva praised Viṣṇu who advised him the
<div n="lb"/>following means for absolution from sin. “A Bhagavān
<div n="lb"/>born from my aspect under the name Yogaśāyī is
<div n="lb"/>living at Prayāga. The great river Varuṇā which has
<div n="lb"/>started from the right leg of Yogaśāyī and which
<div n="lb"/>redeems all sins as also the sublime river Asī, which has
<div n="lb"/>started from his left leg are both worshipped by the whole
<div n="lb"/>world. The temple of Yogaśāyī is at the centre of these
<div n="lb"/>rivers, and that is a sacred place most important in the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds and annihilative of all sins. That city is the
<div n="lb"/>great Vārāṇasī. Even materialistic or worldly people
<div n="lb"/>get salvation there. It is my (Viṣṇu) āśrama. There
<div n="lb"/>dwells Sūrya called Lola destroying all sins. The place
<div n="lb"/>where Keśava my aspect lives, is Daśāśvamedha. If you
<div n="lb"/>go there you will get redemption from sin.”
<div n="NI"/>Thus directed by Viṣṇu Śiva went to Vārāṇasī and
<div n="lb"/>achieved absolution from the sin of Brahmahatyā by
<div n="lb"/>bathing in the holy tīrthas there. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Birth of Vīrabhadra.%} (See under Dakṣa),
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Water in Kālindī got dark in colour.%} (See under
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Śiva became Nāgabhūṣaṇa.%} (See under Nāgāstram).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Blessed Sukeśa.%} Vidyutkeśa, the Rākṣasa married
<div n="lb"/>Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of Sandhyā. While they toured
<div n="lb"/>the world round enjoying their honeymoon Sālakaṭaṅkā
<div n="lb"/>conceived and delivered in due course a son in the
<div n="lb"/>valley of Mount Mandara. Śiva and Pārvatī, who pass-
<div n="lb"/>ed that way in an aerial chariot saw the child and
<div n="lb"/>came down to it. By the blessing of Śiva the child
<div n="lb"/>grew up to a youth very quickly. Śiva named him
<div n="lb"/>Sukeśa and after blessing that he would grow up to
<div n="lb"/>become a pious soul disappeared from the scene.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Śiva, the father of Indrajit.%} (See under Indrajit,
<div n="lb"/>Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) {%Four faces of Śiva.%} (See under Tilottamā, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(x) {%Sword of Śiva.%} Śiva holds a sword in his hand to
<div n="lb"/>destroy the asura tribe. The following is told in
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 166 of Śānti Parva about the origin of the
<div n="lb"/>sword.
[Page726-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā when he created the universe also laid down
<div n="lb"/>laws to keep living beings in the path of righteousness.
<div n="lb"/>But, the asuras did not conform to those laws. So, the
<div n="lb"/>maharṣis decided that there should be some other
<div n="lb"/>means to instruct the asuras. They conducted a Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>yajña at the Himālayas. A terrible Jin (Evil Spirit)
<div n="lb"/>emerged from the sacrificial pit.
<div n="NI"/>At the emergence of the Jin the earth shook; the
<div n="lb"/>great sea grew wild with waves and eddies. Lightning
<div n="lb"/>and shooting stars appeared and branches of trees were
<div n="lb"/>torn asunder. A vicious whirl-wind swept the ten
<div n="lb"/>regions. All living beings trembled at the sight of the
<div n="lb"/>Jin.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā appeared to the frightened maharṣis and told
<div n="lb"/>them that it was not a Jin, but only the sword for
<div n="lb"/>the destruction of the asura tribe. Śiva took the sword
<div n="lb"/>in his hand, and as soon as he touched it he became
<div n="lb"/>possessed of four hands. “Śiva, whose head touched
<div n="lb"/>the sun, who had the third eye and from whose mouth
<div n="lb"/>flames of fire emerged, who changed himself to various
<div n="lb"/>colours like blue, white and red, who wore deer skin
<div n="lb"/>with golden spots, who had on his forehead an eye as
<div n="lb"/>effulgent as the Sun—such Śiva took in his hands the
<div n="lb"/>fiery sword and raising his shield he swirled the sword
<div n="lb"/>in various directions.”
<div n="NI"/>When Śiva, who thus became terrible, walked with the
<div n="lb"/>sword amidst the asura army the entire asura forces
<div n="lb"/>were annihilated and the Devas came out victorious.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Daring deeds of Śiva.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Clash With Viṣṇu.%} Though there were differences
<div n="lb"/>of opinion between Śiva and Viṣṇu on many occasions,
<div n="lb"/>only very rarely had occurred actual clashes between the
<div n="lb"/>two. The Purāṇas refer to two such important clashes.
<div n="lb"/>One has reference to a direct fight Śiva fought with
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and the other is about Śiva's fight with Nārāya-
<div n="lb"/>ṇarṣi, an incarnation of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>There was no reason for the direct fight between Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and Viṣṇu. The Devas wanted to test who was the
<div n="lb"/>more powerful of the two, Śiva or Viṣṇu, and they told
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā about the idea By carrying tales to them, one
<div n="lb"/>against the other, Brahmā made Śiva and Viṣṇu mutual
<div n="lb"/>enemies. The enmity led to a fight between the two.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarman made a bow for each of the contestants.
<div n="lb"/>In the fight between the two Śiva got defeated. Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>who got angry at his temporary defeat presented his
<div n="lb"/>bow and arrow to Devarāta, King of Videha. It was
<div n="lb"/>this bow, which Śrī Rāma broke at the wedding of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā in a later period. As soon as the fight was over
<div n="lb"/>the Devas realised that Viṣṇu was greater than Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>After the fight Viṣṇu gave his bow to Ṛcīka, the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārgava muni. Jamadagni got it from Ṛcīka, and he
<div n="lb"/>gave it to Paraśurāma. It was with this bow that
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma confronted Śrī Rāma on his way back
<div n="lb"/>after wedding Sītā. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Canto 75).
<div n="NI"/>The following story is related in the Anuśāsana Parva
<div n="lb"/>of Mahābhārata about the fight between Nārayaṇarṣi,
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of Viṣṇu and Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva, in great fury, threw his Śūla into the Yajña hall
<div n="lb"/>of Dakṣa, and the Śūla after reducing the Yajña, to
<div n="lb"/>ashes, hit the breast of Nārāyaṇarṣi, who was doing
<div n="lb"/>tapas in Badarikāśrama. Nārāyaṇa raised the sound
<div n="lb"/>‘Hum’ as a result of which the Śūla returned to Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>hands, who, in great anger, rushed forward to Nārāyaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa placed his hand on Śiva's throat with the result
[Page726-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>that it became dark in colour. Thenceforth Śiva came
<div n="lb"/>to be known as Śitikaṇṭha also.
<div n="NI"/>Nārāyaṇa plucked a blade of grass and recited some
<div n="lb"/>mantras. It became a paraśu (axe). He threw it at
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, who broke it into pieces, which act gave him the
<div n="lb"/>additional name of Khaṇḍaparaśu also. The fighting
<div n="lb"/>became fierce and the world began burning. Fire
<div n="lb"/>refused to receive offerings made; Ṛṣis could not
<div n="lb"/>recollect the Vedas; Rajas and Tamas attacked Devas;
<div n="lb"/>the earth shook; planets became dim and dark;
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā fell down from his seat; sky came down; oceans
<div n="lb"/>got dry; the Himālayas crumbled. On the continuous
<div n="lb"/>appearance of such ill omens Brahmā and all the
<div n="lb"/>Devas came to the battlefield. Saluting Rudra Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>told him thus: “Oh! Lord! Let good happen to the
<div n="lb"/>world. In the interests of the welfare of the world. you
<div n="lb"/>would please give up arms. The Naranārāyaṇas are
<div n="lb"/>upholders of righteousness; they are the incarnations of
<div n="lb"/>the indestructible and supreme sages. I was born from
<div n="lb"/>their pleasure. You were born from their wrath.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing these words of Brahmā Śiva cooled down.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Rendered Kāmadeva bodiless (limbless).%} See under
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva, Parva 4).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Bore Gaṅgā on the head.%} See under Gāṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Consumed Kālakūṭa.%} Owing to the curse of
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas the Devas were subjected to symptoms of
<div n="lb"/>old age, and to produce amṛta (nectar) as remedy for
<div n="lb"/>this unfortunate development, the churning of Kṣīrā-
<div n="lb"/>bdhi (ocean of milk) was started. Vāsuki, the snake,
<div n="lb"/>was used as cord to rotate mount Mandara, which
<div n="lb"/>was used as the churning rod. When the churning
<div n="lb"/>became very intense, the mortal poison Kālakūṭa emerg-
<div n="lb"/>ed out of Vāsuki's mouth. (Another view is held that
<div n="lb"/>Kālakūṭa rose out of the milk-sea). On the emergence of
<div n="lb"/>the deadly poison the asuras ran off in great fear, the
<div n="lb"/>Devas got bewildered, Bāli and Sugrīva too got fright-
<div n="lb"/>ened; and without exhibiting his fright Viṣṇu covered
<div n="lb"/>his face; on the whole it appeared as though the entire
<div n="lb"/>world would be reduced to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>At this critical moment, Śiva, reputed for his reckless
<div n="lb"/>daring, put all the Kālakūṭa into his mouth. Frightened
<div n="lb"/>at it Pārvatī held Śiva's throat by her hands so that
<div n="lb"/>the poison did not enter his stomach. At the same
<div n="lb"/>time Mahāviṣṇu covered with his hands Śiva's mouth
<div n="lb"/>so that the poison was not spitted out. Kālakūṭa thus
<div n="lb"/>prevented from going down into the stomach or being
<div n="lb"/>vomited from Śiva's throat got itself digested in the
<div n="lb"/>throat giving it a blue colour. Thus did Śiva become
<div n="lb"/>Nīlakaṇṭha (of the blue throat). Viṣṇu and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>who were affected by the flames of the poison became
<div n="lb"/>Nīlavarṇa and Kālī respectively. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddhakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Destroyed Dakṣa's yajña.%} See under Dakṣa Para 3).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Fought Śaṅkhacūḍa.%} (See under Tulasī, Para 5).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Burned the Tripuras.%} (See under Tripura).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Fought Sūrya.%} Śiva once plucked out Brahmā's head
<div n="lb"/>(See under Kapālī 1), and Brahmā cursed Śiva that he
<div n="lb"/>should beg for food with that head (skull) in his hands.
<div n="lb"/>This fierce curse of Brahmā affected Śiva so much that,
<div n="lb"/>in uncontrollable wrath, he beat whomsoever he met.
<div n="lb"/>Thousands of Devas and others were killed. Sūrya, who
<div n="lb"/>relished not these atrocities of Śiva confronted him with
<div n="lb"/>out-stretched hands. Śiva held with one hand of his,
<div n="lb"/>both the hands of Sūrya from the fingers of which
<div n="lb"/>blood began to flow. Śiva turned Sūrya round and
[Page727-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>round by his hands with the result that the hands of
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya became short. When Sūrya became completely
<div n="lb"/>drenched in blood Śiva let him free and walked to
<div n="lb"/>another side when Sūrya, laughingly challenged him
<div n="lb"/>again to fight. Greatly enraged by the challenge Śiva
<div n="lb"/>fisted him on the face with the result he lost all his
<div n="lb"/>teeth. Also he fell down unconscious. As Sūrya fell
<div n="lb"/>thus Bhaga looked with fierce eyes at Śiva, who then
<div n="lb"/>struck the former on his face, Both the eyes of Bhaga
<div n="lb"/>fell down and the Devas were alarmed by it. Then all
<div n="lb"/>the Ādityas, under the leadership of Indra ran off to the
<div n="lb"/>ten regions along with the Maruts and Agni. Only
<div n="lb"/>prominent asuras like Prahlāda remained on the scene.
<div n="lb"/>They saluted Śiva. Śiva surveyed the yāga hall, the
<div n="lb"/>Devas and the asuras with his three eyes. All of them
<div n="lb"/>then ran away to different places. Śiva looked at the
<div n="lb"/>three Agnis with his three eyes and they were reduced
<div n="lb"/>to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>When Śiva's anger subsided Sūrya was installed in his
<div n="lb"/>former form. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) {%Fought with Andhaka.%} See under Andhaka.
<div n="NI"/>(x) {%Made five Indras Pāṇḍavas.%} The Pāṇḍavas, in their
<div n="lb"/>former life, were Indras. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 199).
<div n="NI"/>The Devas once conducted at Naimisāraṇya a lengthy
<div n="lb"/>yajña of which Yama was the manager. In the absence
<div n="lb"/>of Yama there was no death on earth. Thus, human
<div n="lb"/>beings also, like the Devas, became Amartyas (death-
<div n="lb"/>less). Alarmed at this the Devas submitted their
<div n="lb"/>grievance to Brahmā who pacified them by saying that
<div n="lb"/>Yama would return as soon as the yajña was over and
<div n="lb"/>then men will, as usual be subjected to the process of
<div n="lb"/>death. The Devas then returned to Naimiṣāraṇya,
<div n="lb"/>the scene of their yajña when they saw a woman,
<div n="lb"/>lustrous as fire, descending the steps of Gaṅgā to
<div n="lb"/>carry water. She was sobbing and each drop of tear
<div n="lb"/>that fell into the waters of the river transformed itself
<div n="lb"/>into a lotus flower. As deputed by the Devas Indra
<div n="lb"/>approached the woman to get facts from her.
<div n="NI"/>Indra asked her who she was and why she was weeping.
<div n="lb"/>The woman answered him not, but walked in silence,
<div n="lb"/>to the source of the Gaṅgā. Indra followed her. When
<div n="lb"/>they had thus walked some distance Śiva and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>were found in the forest at a game of dice, and Indra,
<div n="lb"/>afraid of Śiva, ran way. But, Śiva called him back and
<div n="lb"/>asked him to enter the cave there. When Indra did so
<div n="lb"/>after removing the mountain at the entrance of the cave
<div n="lb"/>he saw four Indras sitting there. They were called
<div n="lb"/>Viśvabhuk, Bhūtadhāmā, Śibi and Śānti. The woman
<div n="lb"/>whom Indra had followed was Śrīdevī. Śiva blessed that
<div n="lb"/>the five Indras, in their next birth, would wed Śrīdevī.
<div n="lb"/>When the Indras saw Mahāviṣṇu after this he also
<div n="lb"/>blessed them, and promised them that he would incar-
<div n="lb"/>nate and help them when they were born as men in
<div n="lb"/>their next life. Then Viṣṇu plucked a black and a
<div n="lb"/>white hair and put them on earth. The black hair
<div n="lb"/>was born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Devakī's womb and the white
<div n="lb"/>hair as Balabhadrarāma in the womb of Rohīṇī.
<div n="NI"/>(xi) {%Kirātārjunīyam.%} Arjuna once did tapas to Śiva, who
<div n="lb"/>appeared to him in the garb of a hunter in the forest
<div n="lb"/>and presented to him the Pāśupata arrow. (For details
<div n="lb"/>see under Arjuna, Para 20).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) {%Fought with Mahiṣāsura.%} (See under Mahiṣāsura).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) {%Fought with Vṛtrāsura.%} See under Vṛtrāsura.
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) {%Burnt Himavān.%} Śiva once did tapas on the top of
<div n="lb"/>Himavān when Pārvatī came behind him and covered
[Page727-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>his eyes with her hands. At once darkness enveloped
<div n="lb"/>the whole world, and when people suffered in the
<div n="lb"/>absence of day-light Śiva opened his third eye.
<div n="lb"/>Himavān began getting burnt by the fire emitted by
<div n="lb"/>Śiva's eye. Pārvatī got alarmed at this and woke Śiva
<div n="lb"/>up. He closed his third eye and Himavān resumed its
<div n="lb"/>former shape. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 104).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Worship of Śiva.%} Innumerable people in India
<div n="lb"/>worship Śiva and they follow different forms or systems
<div n="lb"/>of worship. There are forms of worship which follow
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and which do not as also forms which are
<div n="lb"/>sāttvic and which are not. The form of worship called
<div n="lb"/>Paraśupadam (? Pāśupatam) is a very ancient one. It is
<div n="lb"/>believed that the Paraśupadas once honoured and after-
<div n="lb"/>wards opposed the Vedas. The Śiva liṅga at the place
<div n="lb"/>called Gūḍamillam is supposed to be as old as the
<div n="lb"/>second century B.C.
<div n="NI"/>One of the many symbols, which represent Śiva, Śivaliṅga
<div n="lb"/>is the most important. They are of two kinds, the
<div n="lb"/>movable and the immovable. The immovable are those
<div n="lb"/>which appear by themselves or installed in temples. The
<div n="lb"/>movable are those made of earth, stone, timber, gems
<div n="lb"/>etc. There are also temporary liṅgas, which are placed
<div n="lb"/>on stools of various shapes. Liṅgas are made of he-stones
<div n="lb"/>and stools of ‘she-stones’.
<div n="NI"/>There are also various types of liṅgas indicative of the
<div n="lb"/>different attributes of Śiva; for example Liṅgodbhava,
<div n="lb"/>Candrasekhara, Raudra, Umāsahita etc. Kāmāntaka,
<div n="lb"/>Gajāri, Kālāri, Tripuradāhaka etc. represent the Lord
<div n="lb"/>in his fierce aspects. Śiva is also represented in poses of
<div n="lb"/>blessing Caṇḍeśa, Viṣṇu, Nandīśvara, Vighneśvara and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. He is also presented in various poses of dancing,
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣiṇāmūrti is represented in four forms, i.e. Vyākhyāna
<div n="lb"/>Jñāna, Yoga and Vīṇādhara. Bikṣāṭaka, Kapāladhārī.
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādhara, Ardhanārīśvara Vṛṣabhavāhana and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣabhakṣaka are other forms of Śiva. Rarely is he depict-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the form of Sadāśiva, Maheśvara, Ekādaśarudras
<div n="lb"/>Vidyeśvara and Mūrtyaṣṭaka. There are Āgamas descrip-
<div n="lb"/>tive of these forms.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇapati occupies the most prominent place among
<div n="lb"/>Devas connected with Śiva. Gaṇapati came to be wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped from 6-7 centuries B.C. His present idols might
<div n="lb"/>have been made after this period.
<div n="NI"/>There are many temples dedicated to Gaṇapati in South
<div n="lb"/>India. Chief among the idols are iṭaṃpiri (proboscis
<div n="lb"/>turned to the left side) and valaṃpiri (proboscis turned
<div n="lb"/>to the right side). Gaṇapati is a physical aspect of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Being the God who removes obstacles in the
<div n="lb"/>devotee's path, Gaṇapati is called Vighneśvara. The
<div n="lb"/>universe is contained in his big stomach.
<div n="NI"/>Next to Gaṇapati in importance is Subrahmaṇya. He
<div n="lb"/>is worshipped in South India only. Kumāra, Muruka,
<div n="lb"/>Kārttikeya, Skanda, Ārumukha, Guha, etc. are some of
<div n="lb"/>his popular synonyms There are a number of Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya temples in Tamil Nāḍu, many of them on the
<div n="lb"/>tops of hills. In North India Subrahmaṇya temples are
<div n="lb"/>rare. But, books written during the Saṅgha period go
<div n="lb"/>to prove that Subrahmaṇya was worshipped in South
<div n="lb"/>India from very olden times. He is depicted in many
<div n="lb"/>postures, sitting, with six faces, with only one face, with
<div n="lb"/>two hands, with four hands, with wife, wearing the
<div n="lb"/>sacred thread etc.
<div n="NI"/>Now, about Śakti idols. Śakti is the Devī closest to Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>In South India there are special Śakti temples called
<div n="lb"/>Śaktipīṭhālayas. Durgā is the most important among
[Page728-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the manifestations of Śakti. There are idols of Durgās
<div n="lb"/>as standing in the lotus flower and also as mounted on
<div n="lb"/>the lion. Āgamas refer to nine kinds or forms of Durgā
<div n="lb"/>i.e. Nīlakaṇṭhī, Kṣemaṅkarī, Harasiddhi, Raudrā, Vanā,
<div n="lb"/>Agni, Jayā, Vindhyavāsinī, and Ripunāśinī. Durgā's
<div n="lb"/>most terrible form is as Mahiṣāsura-mardinī, found at
<div n="lb"/>Mahābalipuram, Ellora and other places. Durgā is also
<div n="lb"/>called Caṇḍikā and Kātyāyanī. Durgā is worshipped as
<div n="lb"/>Nandā, Bhadrakālī, Ambā, Rājamātaṅgī etc.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śiva's life-period.%} Thousand Caturyugas constitute
<div n="lb"/>one day of Brahmā. According to the Purāṇas fourteen
<div n="lb"/>Indras fall dead from heaven during the life time of one
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Two such life times of Brahmā form one life
<div n="lb"/>time of Viṣṇu; at the end of the period he too will
<div n="lb"/>expire. Śiva's life time is double that of Viṣṇu, accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha. (For details see
<div n="lb"/>under Manvantara).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Śiva and creation of the universe.%} See under Creation).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Māyā Śiva.%} (See under Māyā śiva).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Sahasranāmas (thousand names) of Śiva.%} The thousand
<div n="lb"/>names of Śiva are mentioned mainly in Chapter 285 of
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva and Chapter 17 of Anuśāsana Parva of
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata. There are substantial differences between
<div n="lb"/>the two lists of names.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Aśvatthāmā and Śiva.%} (See under Aśvatthāmā
<div n="lb"/>Para 6).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Rudras.%} The Ekādaśarudras, viz. Mṛgavyādha,
<div n="lb"/>Sarpa, Nirṛti, Ajaikapāt, Ahirbudhnya, Pinākī, Īśvara,
<div n="lb"/>Kapālī, Sthāṇu and Bharga are the sons of Śiva. (Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 66).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Śivabhasma (Ashes worn by Śiva)%} The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>contain many references to the great power of Śivabha-
<div n="lb"/>sman. The following story about even Viṣṇu turning
<div n="lb"/>out to be a devotee of Śiva on account of the sanctity of
<div n="lb"/>Śivabhasma is related in Chapter 101, Pātālakhaṇḍa of
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning or during the Brahmapralaya (deluge)
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu was lying in the great waters of the deluge.
<div n="lb"/>On both sides of Viṣṇu hundred universes each and on
<div n="lb"/>both sides of his feet and at the centre of his head twenty
<div n="lb"/>universes each remained attached. One universe glowed
<div n="lb"/>as a gem on Viṣṇu's nose. Maharṣis like Lomaśa did
<div n="lb"/>tapas seated on his navel. Meanwhile Viṣṇu sat in deep
<div n="lb"/>meditation ready for creation. But, he did not find
<div n="lb"/>anything and began, therefore, sobbing. Then appeared
<div n="lb"/>an extra-mundane light at which he got frightened and
<div n="lb"/>closed his eyes. Śiva, rotating in both his hands a
<div n="lb"/>garland each made of a crore of universes appeared
<div n="lb"/>before Viṣṇu. He then stood up and enquired of the
<div n="lb"/>visitor who he was. Śiva exhibited his form. Śiva told
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu that he had not attained sufficient wisdom for
<div n="lb"/>creation and also advised him to achieve enough know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge by first taking the Varuṇa bath and then the
<div n="lb"/>Bhasma bath.
<div n="NI"/>To this Viṣṇu answered by saying that there was no-
<div n="lb"/>where water enough for him to bathe, and he, who was
<div n="lb"/>closely surrounded by universes, sat in water. But, it
<div n="lb"/>came only up to his thighs. Then Śiva said laughingly
<div n="lb"/>that there was enough water for Viṣṇu to bathe and
<div n="lb"/>cast a glance at him with his (Śiva) eye on the fore-
<div n="lb"/>head and also his left eye. And, immediately Viṣṇu's
<div n="lb"/>body became very small and it began to shiver. Then
<div n="lb"/>Śiva said as follows:-“Oh! Viṣṇu! here is deep water.
<div n="lb"/>you may bathe in it. But Viṣṇu could not get into the
<div n="lb"/>tremendous pool created on Śiva's lap. So, he requested
[Page728-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Śiva for a passage to get into the pool. Śiva “Oh!
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu! Before this even though you sat in water, one
<div n="lb"/>crore yojanas in depth, it came only up to your thighs.
<div n="lb"/>But, now though you are on your legs you say you can-
<div n="lb"/>not enter the water. Look here, the water comes only
<div n="lb"/>up to my thighs. You may descend into it. I shall see
<div n="lb"/>to it that you can step into the water. A Vedic saying
<div n="lb"/>I recite will serve as the step.”
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu:—Nobody can step on sound. One may ascend
<div n="lb"/>on what is material, i.e. with form; but, how could one
<div n="lb"/>step on that which is formless?
<div n="NI"/>Śiva:—Why can you not get hold of that which is and
<div n="lb"/>ascend? You receive this great Veda.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu received it, but it appeared that his hands were
<div n="lb"/>not strong enough to hold it. Śiva smiled at the inabili-
<div n="lb"/>ty of Viṣṇu and asked him to get down into water by
<div n="lb"/>the steps made of Veda and when Viṣṇu descended the
<div n="lb"/>steps into the water, it came only up to his thighs. He
<div n="lb"/>had his bath and then asked Śiva what he should do
<div n="lb"/>next. Śiva:—“What do you feel in your mind? Is it
<div n="lb"/>that you do not feel anything”
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu:—I feel not anything.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva:—If you get sanctified by bhasmasnāna you will
<div n="lb"/>receive the ultimate knowledge. I shall give you the
<div n="lb"/>bhasma.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva took a pinch of bhasma from his breast and chant-
<div n="lb"/>ing the Gāyatrī and pañcākṣara (Om namaśśivāya)
<div n="lb"/>mantras sprinkled it all over the body of Viṣṇu. He
<div n="lb"/>also said to Viṣṇu, “You live, you meditate, now what
<div n="lb"/>do you feel in your mind?” Viṣṇu meditated whereupon
<div n="lb"/>he saw a very bright light in his heart. When he told
<div n="lb"/>Śiva that a light was being seen by him the latter
<div n="lb"/>said that his knowledge was not mature enough and
<div n="lb"/>asked him to eat some bhasma so that it might become
<div n="lb"/>perfect. Viṣṇu accordingly consumed the bhasma, and
<div n="lb"/>lo! he, who was till then red-blue in colour became
<div n="lb"/>as white as pearl. He began to be called Śuklavarṇa
<div n="lb"/>(white in colour) from that day onwards.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu felt happy and contented having seen Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>who asked the former what it was he saw in his mind
<div n="lb"/>just then. Answering that he saw the blissful form of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva before him Viṣṇu fell at the latter's feet. To Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>query as to what boon he desired to have, Viṣṇu replied
<div n="lb"/>that he wanted to become a devotee of Śiva and because
<div n="lb"/>of the greatness of the bhasma Viṣṇu thenceforward
<div n="lb"/>became a devotee of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Śivaliṅga (Phallus).%} Worship of Śivaliṅga is a
<div n="lb"/>popular practice in India. The Purāṇas contain a
<div n="lb"/>number of stories about the importance Sivaliṅga
<div n="lb"/>achieved so as to make it an object of worship. Three
<div n="lb"/>of the more important stories are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Śiva wandered about the world lamenting over the
<div n="lb"/>death of Satīdevī at the Yajña conducted by Dakṣa,
<div n="lb"/>and Kāmadeva followed him with his erotic arrows to
<div n="lb"/>exploit Śiva's sorry predicament. During his wanderings
<div n="lb"/>Śiva once came to the Vindhya mountain. Kāmadeva
<div n="lb"/>followed him there too and began attacking Śiva with
<div n="lb"/>his arrows and to escape from the fierce onslaught Śiva
<div n="lb"/>took refuge in the terrible Dāru forest. There Mahar-
<div n="lb"/>ṣis with their wives lived. Śiva saluted them and re-
<div n="lb"/>quested for alms. But, the Maharṣis only kept mum. They
<div n="lb"/>did not like their wives saluting Śiva. Śiva went about
<div n="lb"/>the ā rama and all the women except Arundhatī and
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā, followed him overcome by lust for him.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this, munis like Bhārgava and Aṅgiras cursed
[Page729-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Śiva that his phallus should drop to the ground. Immedi-
<div n="lb"/>ately it fell down and Śiva disappeared. The phallus
<div n="lb"/>rent asunder the earth, reached Pātāla and rent the
<div n="lb"/>universe also. The whole universe shook at which
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā met Viṣṇu at Pātāla and enquired of him the
<div n="lb"/>reason for the universal upheaval. Viṣṇu answered him
<div n="lb"/>that the world shook because of the weight of Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>phallus, which the maharṣis had caused to be dropped.
<div n="lb"/>Then Brahmā, along with Viṣṇu, came to the spot
<div n="lb"/>where Śiva's phallus lay. At the sight of the limitless
<div n="lb"/>phallus Viṣṇu, in great wonder, descended to Pātāla
<div n="lb"/>mounted on Garuḍa. Brahmā, on his plane, toured
<div n="lb"/>above. Both Viṣṇu and Brahmā returned to earth,
<div n="lb"/>having failed in their attempt to find the end of the
<div n="lb"/>phallus. They then praised Śiva, who appeared to them.
<div n="lb"/>They requested him to take back his phallus from the
<div n="lb"/>earth. Śiva insisted that he would do so only if the
<div n="lb"/>Devas agreed to worship his phallus. Viṣṇu agreed to
<div n="lb"/>the suggestion. Brahmā took the phallus, golden
<div n="lb"/>brassy in colour. Thereafter Mahāviṣṇu created
<div n="lb"/>the four castes and various śāstraic texts for each of the
<div n="lb"/>castes to worship the phallus. The four texts are known
<div n="lb"/>as Śaivam, Pāśupatam, Kāladamanam and Kāpālikam.
<div n="lb"/>After making the above arrangements Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu returned. Śiva took back his phallus. (Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Eightyeight thousand Bālakhilyas were born from
<div n="lb"/>the mind of Brahmā. They emaciated their bodies by
<div n="lb"/>constant baths, fasting and worship of Śiva. Though
<div n="lb"/>they worshipped Śiva thus for one thousand divya years,
<div n="lb"/>he did not appear in front of them.
<div n="NI"/>Afterwards, when Pārvatī was travelling by sky one day,
<div n="lb"/>the latter saw and took pity on the Bālakhilyas and told
<div n="lb"/>Śiva thus: “These maharṣis are suffering like anything.
<div n="lb"/>For my sake, you should put an end to their sufferings.
<div n="lb"/>Has their evil fate no end? They are reduced to mere
<div n="lb"/>skin and bones, and yet they are denied realisation.”
<div n="lb"/>Smilingly Śiva told Pārvatī as follows “You do not know
<div n="lb"/>the real course of righteousness. These people do not
<div n="lb"/>understand righteousness; they are not free from lust
<div n="lb"/>and anger. They are mere fools.” At these words of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, Pārvatī told him thus: If things be as you have
<div n="lb"/>said please show me their nature, I feel interested. Then
<div n="lb"/>Śiva asked Pārvatī to remain where she was, telling her
<div n="lb"/>that he would go to the Bālakhilyas and show her how
<div n="lb"/>they behaved. Accordingly Śiva went to them.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva approached the Bālakhilyas in the guise of a hand-
<div n="lb"/>some youth, wearing the Vanamālā garland on his
<div n="lb"/>head, holding the alms bowl in his hands and complete-
<div n="lb"/>ly in the nude and requested for alms. The Women-
<div n="lb"/>folk of the Advaitins were much attracted by the hand-
<div n="lb"/>some youth and came to him with a lot of fruits, roots
<div n="lb"/>etc. by way of alms. Śiva wished them good and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī espied her smiling lord from her seat.
<div n="NI"/>After giving him alms the women spoke to him as
<div n="lb"/>follows: “Oh! anchorite, what penance are you
<div n="lb"/>practising? You have no clothes on you, but you wear
<div n="lb"/>Vanamālā. You are a handsome sannyāsī. If you
<div n="lb"/>have no objection, please tell us about you.” The
<div n="lb"/>sannyāsī (Śiva) answered them by saying that his was
<div n="lb"/>a very secret penance and could not be imparted to
<div n="lb"/>others. Especially in the presence of so many others it
<div n="lb"/>could not be revealed. So, you may please go. But,
<div n="lb"/>the women said that they wished very much to hear the
<div n="lb"/>secret, and they caught hold of his hands saying ‘Come’.
[Page729-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>The women were overcome by lust and one of them
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of his neck, another of his hands, another
<div n="lb"/>of his knees, another of his hair and yet another of his
<div n="lb"/>waist. Seeing the excitement of their wives the mahar-
<div n="lb"/>ṣis cried, ‘Strike him’ and struck down his phallus
<div n="lb"/>with sticks and stones. As soon as the phallus was
<div n="lb"/>thus felled down, Śiva disappeared from the spot and
<div n="lb"/>returned to Kailāsa with Pārvatī.
<div n="NI"/>When the phallus fell down the whole universe shook
<div n="lb"/>and the maharṣis were alarmed. A very intelligent
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi among them said:—“We know not the real
<div n="lb"/>facts about the great ascetic. Let us take refuge in
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. He may know the facts.” Accordingly the
<div n="lb"/>maharṣis went to Brahmā, who found fault with their
<div n="lb"/>ignorance and indiscretion and asked them to shed
<div n="lb"/>their anger and please Śiva. Accordingly they went to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa and praised Śiva, who appeared to them and
<div n="lb"/>told them as follows:—“You may now return. The
<div n="lb"/>phallus will belong to you. I shall be pleased if you
<div n="lb"/>would duly install it. Nothing will be impossible
<div n="lb"/>to those who worship my phallus with devotion. Even
<div n="lb"/>sins consciously committed will be removed by the
<div n="lb"/>worship of my phallus. You install the phallus you
<div n="lb"/>struck down in the great pond of Sannihita. That
<div n="lb"/>will achieve for you all your desires. Even the Devas
<div n="lb"/>will worship it under the name ‘Sthāṇu’. Being install-
<div n="lb"/>ed at Sthāṇvīśvara it will be known as Sthāṇvīśvara
<div n="lb"/>also. Constant meditation upon Sthāṇu will remove
<div n="lb"/>all sins. The sight of Sthāṇu will bring about salva-
<div n="lb"/>tion.”
<div n="NI"/>After this the maharṣis, along with Brahmā, returned
<div n="lb"/>to Dāru forest to carry the phallus to Sannihita. But,
<div n="lb"/>they could not move it even by an iota. They returned
<div n="lb"/>again to Kailāsa, but could not see Śiva there. When
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā sat in meditation for sometime to know where
<div n="lb"/>Śiva was, he saw in his mind Śiva, in the guise of an
<div n="lb"/>elephant, standing in the stream praised by munis.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately Brahmā and others went there, but missed
<div n="lb"/>Śiva there. But Pārvatī appeared there and served
<div n="lb"/>them amṛta (nectar). When they had consumed the
<div n="lb"/>nectar they saw Śiva standing in the stream, and they
<div n="lb"/>spoke about their difficulties to him.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva, in the guise of the elephant, accompanied them to
<div n="lb"/>the Dāru forest where he, in sport, took the phallus
<div n="lb"/>by his proboscis and installed it on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the stream. All those who witnessed the installa-
<div n="lb"/>tion attained ultimate realisation. Upon the phallus
<div n="lb"/>thus installed Brahmā built another phallus with stone.
<div n="lb"/>After a period that phallus became one with the
<div n="lb"/>effulgence of the first phallus. Those who saw that also
<div n="lb"/>achieved ultimate realisation. Immediately Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>built, for the pleasure of the Devas, seven phalluses
<div n="lb"/>one upon the other, and sages attained ultimate realis-
<div n="lb"/>ation by smearing their bodies with the dust of the
<div n="lb"/>phalluses. The spot where the phallus was installed
<div n="lb"/>became famous by the name Sthāṇutīrtha. (Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 45).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In the beginning Brahmā entrusted Śiva with
<div n="lb"/>the duty of creation and to earn the power for creation
<div n="lb"/>he lived under water for many generations. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>having not returned though Brahmā waited for him
<div n="lb"/>long, the latter created the prajāpatis and got done by
<div n="lb"/>them all creations. Then it was that Śiva, having
<div n="lb"/>acquired all the more power, came out of water. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>who got angry that all creations were effected in his
[Page730-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>absence plucked his phallus and threw it into the
<div n="lb"/>earth. He said that, since matters of creation had been
<div n="lb"/>managed by Brahmā, he needed the phallus no further.
<div n="lb"/>The phallus thus thrown by Śiva stuck to the earth
<div n="lb"/>and remained pointed upwards. Next, Śiva performed a
<div n="lb"/>dance of annihilation among the Devas. Ultimately, on
<div n="lb"/>the request of the Devas Śiva deposited his fire of wrath
<div n="lb"/>in water. It is that fire which dries up water in seas,
<div n="lb"/>rivers etc. When Śiva had shed his anger and become
<div n="lb"/>quiet the Devas worshipped the phallus, which had
<div n="lb"/>stuck to the earth, and thenceforth worship of Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>phallus became popular. (M.B. Sauptika Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 17).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Śivalīlās (Sports of Śiva).%} The Purāṇas refer to the

<div n="NI"/>18) {%Bull of Śiva.%} Cows were born on earth from
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi. The foam of milk which flowed like sea
<div n="lb"/>from cows rose into waves and fell in Śivabhūmi (Śiva
<div n="lb"/>land). Śiva did not like it. He opened his third eye
<div n="lb"/>and looked at the cows. The flames from the eye
<div n="lb"/>caused different colours to the cows. The cows took
<div n="lb"/>refuge with Candra. But, the fire of Śiva's eye followed
<div n="lb"/>the cows there also. At last the Prajāpatis pacified
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and presented him a bull for vehicle. From that
<div n="lb"/>day onwards Śiva came to be known as Vṛṣabhavāhana
<div n="lb"/>and Vṛṣabhāṅka also. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 77).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) The son Śuka was born to Vyāsa because of the
<div n="lb"/>blessing of Śiva. (Devī Bhāgavata, 1st Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) During the period of emperor Pṛthu when the
<div n="lb"/>Devas made the earth a cow and milked resources, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>served as calf. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 69, Verse 24).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Śiva occupies a seat in Kubera's court. (Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 21).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Śiva once presented an armour to Indra. (Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 61).
<div n="NI"/>(v) When the battle with the Tripuras reached its
<div n="lb"/>climax in intensity Śiva mounted the Bull and looked
<div n="lb"/>at the capital of the asuras. As a result of the fiery look
<div n="lb"/>the breasts of cows were cut and their hoofs rent into
<div n="lb"/>two. The hoofs of cattle came to be cleft from that
<div n="lb"/>day onwards. (Karṇa Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 105).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Living beings are kept healthy by the kindness of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. (Sauptika Parva, Chapter 18, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) It was Śiva, who organised the penal code in the
<div n="lb"/>world. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 80).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Once in the war between the Devas and the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras Śiva gave refuge to Śukrācārya. (Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 389, Verse 36).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) Śiva performed the thread wearing ceremony of
<div n="lb"/>Śuka, the son of Vyāsa. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 248,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 19).

<div n="lb"/>their city to ashes they saw him as a boy with five
<div n="lb"/>horns. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 160, Verse 32).
<div n="NI"/>(xi) There is a story in Śānti Parva of Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>about Śiva's bringing back to life the dead child of a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin. The story was told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira.
<div n="lb"/>The brahmin took his dead child to the burning ghat
<div n="lb"/>when a fox asked him to wait at least till dusk to see
<div n="lb"/>if the child would regain life. At the same time a
<div n="lb"/>vulture, which came there pointed out to the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>that the dead never came back to life and asked him to
<div n="lb"/>leave the dead body there and return home. As advised
<div n="lb"/>by the fox and the vulture the brahmin took to the
<div n="lb"/>burning ghat and took back from there the dead body
<div n="lb"/>of his child. Pārvatī took pity on the brahmin and as
<div n="lb"/>requested by her Śiva brought the child back to life.
<div n="lb"/>The logic and reasoning advanced by the fox and the
[Page731-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>vulture for their selfish ends is famous under the name
<div n="lb"/>Gṛdhragomāyusaṃvāda.
