SADĀCĀRA¦ (Good conduct).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Each country has good custom-
ary practices of its own. A man with good habits or
behaviour is considered as having conquered the two
worlds. The sound ‘Sat’ denotes ‘Sādhus.’ Sādhus are
those who are without any bad conduct or behaviour.
The habits and practices of the Sādhus are called
Sadācāra. The Saptarṣis, (the seven hermits), the
Prajāpatis (Lords of all creatures) and Manus (the
fathers of men), were persons who were careful to keep
up the good practices. Once the hermit Aurva advised
Sagara, what the good usages of the people of Bhārata
ought to be. The laws of good conduct according to
hermit Aurva are given below:
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The passing of excrement and urine.%} Every one should
wake up in the Brāhmamuhūrta (Two hours before
dawn). After having risen, he should go to the south-
west corner of the village or house at a distance of an
arrow-shot for stooling and passing urine; should not
pour the water used for washing the face and the legs,
in the courtyard; should not pass urine in one's own
shadow, or in the shade of a tree, or facing cow, the
Sun, fire, wind, teacher and Brahmin. Ploughed fields,
fields where grains are ready for harvest, cattleshed,
crowd, path, lakes or rivers and their banks, are places,
forbidden for stooling or passing urine. When there is
no danger, a wise man should pass urine, facing the
north in the day and facing south at night. When
passing excrement the ground should be covered with
grass and his head should be covered with cloth. Should
not sit long or talk much when stooling.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The conduct of ablution after answering the calls of%}
{%nature and rinsing the mouth after meals.%} Soil such as taken
from white ant-hill, ground thrown up by moles or rats,
soil at the bottom of water, remainder of soil used by
another, soil taken from the wall, soil gathered by worms
and flies, ploughed soil etc. should not be used for ablu-
tion. By using soil, do the cleansing of the urethra
once, the anus thrice, the left hand ten times, and both
the hands together, seven times. After this use pure
water (in which there is no mud or foam and which has
no foul smell) and rinse the mouth. Take soil again
and wash the legs with it. Rinse the mouth thrice and
wipe the face twice. Then holding water in the hand,
touch the apertures in the head such as eye, etc. the
crest of the head, both upper arms, navel and heart.
With this rinsing take bath. After bath, with the help
of a mirror, tie the hair, anoint the eyes with collyrium,
and wear flower garlands etc. carefully. Bathing should
be done in river, rivulet, lake, jungle-stream, mountain
[Page661-a+ 65]
or holy bath (tīrtha), or draw water from the well and
bathe there or carry well-water home and bathe there.
After the bath put on clean dress. Then take some
water in the hand, offer it as oblation to gods, sages, and
the manes with care. Throw water thrice for the
blessing of the gods and hermits and to Prajāpati once,
as ordained. In the same way, to the manes and the
great ancestors also give oblation of water thrice.
<div n="NI"/>After so much is done do the customary sacrificial
offerings, prayer etc. to Devī. Then invite guests to the
house and welcome them. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3,
Chapter 11).
