DHRUVASANDHI¦. A king of Kosala. During the reign
<div n="lb"/>of this King there was prosperity in Ayodhyā and the
<div n="lb"/>people were virtuous. This king had two wives
<div n="lb"/>Manoramā and Līlāvatī. A son named Sudarśana was
<div n="lb"/>born to Manoramā. After a month the second wife
<div n="lb"/>also gave birth to a son named Śatrujit. The King was
<div n="lb"/>much pleased and both sons were brought up alike.
<div n="lb"/>As Śatrujit was cleverer than Sudarśana people loved
<div n="lb"/>Śatrujit more.
<div n="NI"/>Once Dhruvasandhi went to the forest for hunt-
<div n="lb"/>ing and was killed by a lion in the forest. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the custom Sudarśana became King. Līlā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, the mother of Śatrujit was the daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>King of Ujjayinī. Her desire was to make Śatrujit the
<div n="lb"/>King. Manoramā. the mother of Sudarśana was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of the King of Kaliṅga. Hearing about the
<div n="lb"/>death of Dhruvasandhi, the kings of Ujjayinī and
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga arrived at Ayodhyā. The King of Ujjayinī
<div n="lb"/>got angry because Sudarśana was made king and
<div n="lb"/>began war. The King of Kaliṅga took the side of
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana. A terrible battle was fought in Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>as to who should be the heir to the throne. In the
<div n="lb"/>battle Yudhājit, the King of Ujjayinī, killed Vīrasena,
<div n="lb"/>the king of Kaliṅga. Sudarśana and his mother
<div n="lb"/>Manoramā were in a sorry plight. According to the
<div n="lb"/>advice of minister Vidulla, Manoramā and Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>fled from the capital. Vidulla and the maid of
<div n="lb"/>Manoramā accompanied them. In two days they
<div n="lb"/>reached Gaṅgātaṭa. They were caught by fishermen
<div n="lb"/>thieves and they lost everything they had. At last with
<div n="lb"/>the help of a boat they crossed the Ganges and reached
<div n="lb"/>Trikūṭa. They went to the hermitage of Bharadvāja
[Page239-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>who was doing penance there. He gave them protec-
<div n="lb"/>tion.
<div n="NI"/>After making Śatrujjit King, Yudhājit began to search
<div n="lb"/>for Manoramā and Sudarśana. He got news that they
<div n="lb"/>lived in Citrakūṭa. Yudhājit went there with an army.
<div n="lb"/>But he could not get them out of the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja. Manoramā and Sudarśana lived safely in
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>Once Vidulla came to the hermitage of Bharadvāja to
<div n="lb"/>enquire about Manoramā. Seeing the old man the
<div n="lb"/>hermit boys called out “Klība Klība.” Prince Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>heard only “Klī”. The syllable ‘Klī’ is the spell called
<div n="lb"/>‘Kāmarāja bījamantra’. Without knowing its meaning
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana called out ‘Klī’ several times. With that the
<div n="lb"/>prince got a special power.
<div n="NI"/>Six more years passed. The prince became eleven years
<div n="lb"/>old. By this time Bharadvāja had taught the prince
<div n="lb"/>Vedas, Śāśtras, etc. The prince was a devotee of Devī.
<div n="lb"/>Devī appeared before him and gave him a bow and a
<div n="lb"/>quiver which would never become empty, and an
<div n="lb"/>impenetrable armour. Sudarśana married Śaśikalā the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of the King of Kāśī. Niṣāda, the King of
<div n="lb"/>Śṛṅgiverapura, was a friend of Dhruvasandhi. He gave
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana a chariot which Sudarśana rode through the
<div n="lb"/>forest. With the help of the King of Kāśī and others
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana recaptured Ayodhyā. He made Vidulla his
<div n="lb"/>minister and ruled over the country for a long time.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 3).
