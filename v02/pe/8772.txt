YOGA II¦. It is Jñāna that reveals Brahman. Yoga is the
<div n="lb"/>concentration on Brahman. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 372,
<div n="lb"/>mentions that Yoga is the perfect union of Jivātmā and
<div n="lb"/>Paramātmā.
<div n="NI"/>In fact Yoga is activity with the body as its basis. It
<div n="lb"/>may be doubted how a mere physical karman helps
<div n="lb"/>Parabrahmadārśana. But Maharṣis assert that there
<div n="lb"/>is an inseparable connection between matter and soul.
<div n="NI"/>Matter and soul are merely the two phases of the
<div n="lb"/>single “Astitva”. The object of Yoga is to achieve
<div n="lb"/>union with Parabrahman; in other words, to attain
<div n="lb"/>Mokṣa. The recitation of mantras is important in many
<div n="lb"/>disciplines connected with the practice of Yoga. The
<div n="lb"/>letters and words of mantras are so arranged that their
<div n="lb"/>recitation in the proper manner produces profound and
<div n="lb"/>favourable effects in the body. The habitual recitation
<div n="lb"/>of mantras helps the practice of Yoga.
<div n="NI"/>There are two broad divisions of Yoga—Haṭha Yoga
<div n="lb"/>and Rāja Yoga. The two are interconnected and have
<div n="lb"/>to be practised simultaneously. Haṭha Yoga is mainly
<div n="lb"/>concerned with disciplining the body by various kinds
<div n="lb"/>of exercises. Standing in Pañcāgni with the arms held
<div n="lb"/>aloft; standing on one leg or standing on the head are
<div n="lb"/>some of these exercises. Rāja Yoga aims at arousing
<div n="lb"/>Prajñā by control of the senses.
[Page898-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Rāja Yoga involves the practice of eight disciplines.
<div n="lb"/>They are:—Yama, Niyama, Āsana, Prāṇāyāma,
<div n="lb"/>Pratyāhāra, Dhāraṇā, Dhyāna and Samādhi. An
<div n="lb"/>account of each of these is given below:—
<div n="NI"/>i) {%Yama.%} Yama means refraining from evil courses or
<div n="lb"/>sinful things like cruelty or dishonesty. Yama demands
<div n="lb"/>the practice of Ahiṃsā, satya, asteya, brahmacarya and
<div n="lb"/>aparigraha. (Ahiṃsā = non-violence or not killing any
<div n="lb"/>creature. Satya = truth; practising truth in thoughts,
<div n="lb"/>words and deeds. Asteya = not stealing. Brahmacarya =
<div n="lb"/>sexual continence. Aparigraha = not coveting wealth or
<div n="lb"/>pleasures which are not absolutely necessary).
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%Niyama.%} While Yama is a negative discipline,
<div n="lb"/>Niyama is a positive one. It requires the positive practice
<div n="lb"/>of virtuous courses. Niyama includes five things:—
<div n="lb"/>Śauca (cleanliness), Santoṣa (contentment), Tapas
<div n="lb"/>(penance and austerities), Svādhyāya (study of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and incantations or mantras) and Īśvarapraṇi-
<div n="lb"/>dhāna (prayer and meditating on God). Śauca means
<div n="lb"/>not only cleanliness of the body, but also of the mind.
<div n="lb"/>The mind must be purged of all ‘malas’ like kāma,
<div n="lb"/>krodha and lobha. Tapas means ability to endure
<div n="lb"/>opposites (dvandvas) like heat and cold or joy and
<div n="lb"/>sorrow. Svādhyāya is “study of philosophical works.”
<div n="lb"/>Īśvarapraṇidhāna—dedicating all actions unto God.
<div n="NI"/>iii) {%Āsana.%} The way of sitting or posture. Different
<div n="lb"/>postures have been prescribed for different actions.
<div n="lb"/>First of all, the yogī must choose a suitable place.
<div n="NI"/>(The place must be level, neat, free from stones, fire or
<div n="lb"/>gravel, agreeable to the mind and not causing irritation
<div n="lb"/>to the eyes). (Śvetāśvatara).
<div n="NI"/>Different āsanas like Padmāsana, Svastikāsana and
<div n="lb"/>Siddhāsana have been prescribed for the practice of
<div n="lb"/>Yoga.
<div n="NI"/>Putting the left leg on the right thigh and the right leg
<div n="lb"/>on the left thigh, holding the right toe with the left
<div n="lb"/>hand and the left toe with the right hand, place the
<div n="lb"/>chin on the chest and look at the tip of the nose. This
<div n="lb"/>is Padmāsana.
<div n="NI"/>Sitting upright with the feet tucked under the hips is
<div n="lb"/>Svastikāsana.
<div n="NI"/>Placing the left leg under the genitals, put the right
<div n="lb"/>leg on it. Insert the chin into the pit of the throat;
<div n="lb"/>control the senses; with steady eyes look at the point
<div n="lb"/>between the eye-brows. This is Siddhāsana which will
<div n="lb"/>break open the doors to Mokṣa.
<div n="NI"/>iv) {%Prāṇāyāma.%} This is regulation of breathing. Inhale
<div n="lb"/>air through the left nostril, retain the air in the lungs
<div n="lb"/>for a few minutes and then exhale it through the right
<div n="lb"/>nostril. The process may be reversed—that is inhala-
<div n="lb"/>tion through the right nostril and exhalation through
<div n="lb"/>the left. This is the first step in Prāṇāyāma. Exhaling
<div n="lb"/>the breath and then not inhaling for some time is
<div n="lb"/>called recaka; the opposite process is called pūraka.
<div n="lb"/>The object of prāṇāyāma is to awaken Kuṇḍalinī.
<div n="NI"/>v) {%Pratyāhāra.%} This is a process of withdrawing the
<div n="lb"/>five senses from the outer world. A man who practises
<div n="lb"/>Pratyāhāra becomes oblivious of the outer world. This
<div n="lb"/>helps the concentration of the mind on the Ātman.
<div n="NI"/>vi) {%Dhāraṇā.%} Withdrawing the mind from outer objects
<div n="lb"/>and concentrating it on the self.
<div n="NI"/>vii) {%Dhyāna.%} Meditation, concentrating the mind on
<div n="lb"/>several places like Bhrūmadhya and nābhīcakra. Re-
<div n="lb"/>peating the sacred syllable OM is very useful in dhyāna.
[Page899-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>viii) {%Samādhi.%} In Samādhi the soul and mind unite,
<div n="lb"/>the mind merging into the soul. Samādhi is defined
<div n="lb"/>thus:—
<div n="NI"/>When the mind and soul unite just as salt and water
<div n="lb"/>unite, that state is called Samādhi.
