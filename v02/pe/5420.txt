PṚṢADHRA I¦. The ninth son of Vaivasvata Manu. He is
described as one of the sacred and virtuous persons to
be remembered during early mornings. He did penance
at Kurukṣetra and attained Svarga. (Śloka 11, Chapter
20, Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Even from boyhood Pṛṣadhra started practice of
penance. He got disgusted with life even from his
boyhood. A story is told how it happened so. Once
when Pṛṣadhra was studying under his Guru, a tiger
entered the shed of the cows at night. Hearing the piti-
able wails of the cow he went to the shed with his sword
and gave a strong and fatal cut to the tiger with it. Un-
fortunately the stroke fell on the cow instead of the tiger
and not knowing the truth in the darkness Pṛṣadhra
went and slept peacefully. In the morning when he
went to the shed he found the cow lying dead with
his sword-cut. He then knew the mistake he had made
at night and was so distressed with the accident that he
at once left for Kurukṣetra and started doing penance
there.
