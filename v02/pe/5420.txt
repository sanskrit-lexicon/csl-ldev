PṚṢADHRA I¦. The ninth son of Vaivasvata Manu. He is
<div n="lb"/>described as one of the sacred and virtuous persons to
<div n="lb"/>be remembered during early mornings. He did penance
<div n="lb"/>at Kurukṣetra and attained Svarga. (Śloka 11, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>20, Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Even from boyhood Pṛṣadhra started practice of
<div n="lb"/>penance. He got disgusted with life even from his
<div n="lb"/>boyhood. A story is told how it happened so. Once
<div n="lb"/>when Pṛṣadhra was studying under his Guru, a tiger
<div n="lb"/>entered the shed of the cows at night. Hearing the piti-
<div n="lb"/>able wails of the cow he went to the shed with his sword
<div n="lb"/>and gave a strong and fatal cut to the tiger with it. Un-
<div n="lb"/>fortunately the stroke fell on the cow instead of the tiger
<div n="lb"/>and not knowing the truth in the darkness Pṛṣadhra
<div n="lb"/>went and slept peacefully. In the morning when he
<div n="lb"/>went to the shed he found the cow lying dead with
<div n="lb"/>his sword-cut. He then knew the mistake he had made
<div n="lb"/>at night and was so distressed with the accident that he
<div n="lb"/>at once left for Kurukṣetra and started doing penance
<div n="lb"/>there.
