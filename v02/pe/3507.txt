KHAGAMA¦. A Brāhmaṇa. In Mahābhārata, there is a
story which describes how this Brahmin Khagama
changed another Brahmin to a serpent by cursing him.
The Brahmin Khagama and Sahasrapāt were friends.
Once Sahasrapāt made a snake of grass and terrified
Khagama at Agnihotra (Burnt offering in the holy fire)
Khagama instantly cursed Sahasrapāt to become a
serpent. Sahasrapāt requested for liberation from the
curse. Khagama said that he would resume his original
form on the day he saw Ruru the son of Pramati. From
that day onwards Sahasrapāt roamed about in several
countries in the form of a serpent.
<div n="NI"/>Once Pramadvarā the wife of Ruru, died by snake-bite.
Ruru cried over the death of his wife for a long time.
According to the advice of a messenger from the
Devas Ruru gave half of his life-time to his wife and
she came to life again. But Ruru felt a bitter hatred
against serpents and began their extermination. Once
he met with Sahasrapāt. Instantly at the sight of Ruru,
Sahasrapāt obtained his original form. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 11).
