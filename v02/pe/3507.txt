KHAGAMA¦. A Brāhmaṇa. In Mahābhārata, there is a
<div n="lb"/>story which describes how this Brahmin Khagama
<div n="lb"/>changed another Brahmin to a serpent by cursing him.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmin Khagama and Sahasrapāt were friends.
<div n="lb"/>Once Sahasrapāt made a snake of grass and terrified
<div n="lb"/>Khagama at Agnihotra (Burnt offering in the holy fire)
<div n="lb"/>Khagama instantly cursed Sahasrapāt to become a
<div n="lb"/>serpent. Sahasrapāt requested for liberation from the
<div n="lb"/>curse. Khagama said that he would resume his original
<div n="lb"/>form on the day he saw Ruru the son of Pramati. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards Sahasrapāt roamed about in several
<div n="lb"/>countries in the form of a serpent.
<div n="NI"/>Once Pramadvarā the wife of Ruru, died by snake-bite.
<div n="lb"/>Ruru cried over the death of his wife for a long time.
<div n="lb"/>According to the advice of a messenger from the
<div n="lb"/>Devas Ruru gave half of his life-time to his wife and
<div n="lb"/>she came to life again. But Ruru felt a bitter hatred
<div n="lb"/>against serpents and began their extermination. Once
<div n="lb"/>he met with Sahasrapāt. Instantly at the sight of Ruru,
<div n="lb"/>Sahasrapāt obtained his original form. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 11).
