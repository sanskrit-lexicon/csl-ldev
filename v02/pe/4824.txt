NIMI I¦. A famous emperor who was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku.
[Page539-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān—Vaivasvata Manu—
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku—Nimi.
<div n="NI"/>Among the sons of Ikṣvāku, Daṇḍa, Vikukṣi and Nimi
<div n="lb"/>became famous.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Vasiṣṭha's curse.%} Emperor Nimi was very generous
<div n="lb"/>with his gifts. He was interested in performing yajñas.
<div n="lb"/>The feeding hall that can be seen even today near the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Gautama Maharṣi was built by emperor Nimi.
<div n="lb"/>The emperor, a person of rājasic nature, decided to
<div n="lb"/>conduct a Yajña which would take a long time to end
<div n="lb"/>and which required much money for gifts; and he got
<div n="lb"/>his father Ikṣvāku's permission for it. Arrangements
<div n="lb"/>were made for the Yajña, and Ṛṣis like Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>Vāmadeva, Pulastya, Pulaha and Ṛcīka who were
<div n="lb"/>competent to perform yajña and great scholars in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas were invited for the Yajña. Lastly he met his
<div n="lb"/>family preceptor Vasiṣṭha and told him thus: “Oh
<div n="lb"/>preceptor! I have made all arrangements for a Yajña,
<div n="lb"/>which it is my desire should last for five hundred years.
<div n="lb"/>You would also come with me and see that the Yajña
<div n="lb"/>is duly performed.”
<div n="NI"/>Vasiṣṭha listened to Nimi's request with great atten-
<div n="lb"/>tion. But, he had already been invited by Indra to
<div n="lb"/>conduct a Yajña which would last for five hundred
<div n="lb"/>years, and he would be able to oblige Nimi only after
<div n="lb"/>that period of time. So Vasiṣṭha asked the emperor to
<div n="lb"/>postpone his proposed yajña by five hundred years.
<div n="lb"/>Nimi returned disappointed.
<div n="NI"/>Nimi had no patience to wait for five hundred years.
<div n="lb"/>So he started the yajña with Gautama as his preceptor.
<div n="lb"/>After Indra's Yajña for 500 years was over, Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>came to Nimi's Yajña hall. Nimi, at the time, was in
<div n="lb"/>the inner apartment of his palace. Though his servants
<div n="lb"/>went to him to tell him that his preceptor Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>had come, they waited outside his chamber as he
<div n="lb"/>was sleeping then. Within a few moments Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>was ablaze with anger. He raised his hands and cursed
<div n="lb"/>Nimi thus: “Oh! Nimi, you have insulted me, your
<div n="lb"/>preceptor. You disobeyed my injunction and began the
<div n="lb"/>Yajña. Therefore, let your body be parted from the
<div n="lb"/>soul and fall on the ground.”
<div n="NI"/>This curse of Vasiṣṭha alarmed the servants of Nimi so
<div n="lb"/>much that they roused him from sleep and told him all
<div n="lb"/>about the affair. Nimi hurried to Vasiṣṭha and pro-
<div n="lb"/>strated at his feet. But, he did not shed his anger. This
<div n="lb"/>made Nimi also angry. He also raised up his hands and
<div n="lb"/>cursed Vasiṣṭha thus: “Oh muni! you who got angry
<div n="lb"/>without reason are worse than a Caṇḍāla. Therefore
<div n="lb"/>let your body also be parted from the soul and fall to
<div n="lb"/>the ground.”
<div n="NI"/>Vasiṣṭha got alarmed at the above curse. He ran up to
<div n="lb"/>and submitted his grievance to Brahmā, who told him
<div n="lb"/>thus:—“My son, your action was really fool-hardy.
<div n="lb"/>Yet, I shall advise you a way out of your troubles. You
<div n="lb"/>dissolve your-self in the effulgence of Mitra and Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>and remain there permanently. After sometime you
<div n="lb"/>will be able to be born without being present in the
<div n="lb"/>womb of a woman. Then you will remember every-
<div n="lb"/>thing about your previous birth will acquire sense of
<div n="lb"/>righteousness and knowledge of the Vedas will become
<div n="lb"/>respected by all and will be omniscient.
<div n="NI"/>The soul of Vasiṣṭha parted from his body on account
<div n="lb"/>of the curse of Nimi, saluted Brahmā, went to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Mitrāvaruṇas and got mixed with their
[Page539-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>effulgence. Meanwhile Urvaśī one day came to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Mitrāvaruṇas, who had seminal emission at
<div n="lb"/>her sight. The semen fell into a pot. The pot duly
<div n="lb"/>burst open and there emerged from it Agastya and
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="NI"/>Nimi returned to the Yajña hall and told the munis
<div n="lb"/>about the curse on him of Vasiṣṭha. While the munis
<div n="lb"/>were helplessly looking on, Nimi's body got separated
<div n="lb"/>from the soul and fell down. The munis placed the
<div n="lb"/>dead body in an uncovered coffin, kept it free from
<div n="lb"/>putrefaction with the help of medicines and mantras
<div n="lb"/>and continued with the Yajña. At the close of the
<div n="lb"/>Yajña the Devas appeared and asked Nimi which did
<div n="lb"/>he prefer to have, a human body or body of a Deva.
<div n="lb"/>He preferred to have a Deva body, and accordingly
<div n="lb"/>ascended to Svarga along with the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>As Nimi had no sons to perform his obsequies the
<div n="lb"/>munis began churning the corpse repeating mantras
<div n="lb"/>and there arose from it an ideal person as glowing as
<div n="lb"/>Nimi. As he was created by ‘mathana’ (churning) the
<div n="lb"/>munis named him Mithi. Again, as he was created
<div n="lb"/>from a dead body he came to be known as Janaka also.
<div n="lb"/>Further, as he was born from the body from which the
<div n="lb"/>soul had departed he was called Videha also. The
<div n="lb"/>famous kingdom of Mithilā on the banks of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>was founded by this Janaka.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka, the father of Sītā, was a King born in this
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. To all the Kings born in this dynasty the
<div n="lb"/>surname ‘Janaka’ came to be applied. This dynasty is
<div n="lb"/>known as Janakavaṃśa and Videhavaṃśa after emperor
<div n="lb"/>Mithi. (Devī Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
