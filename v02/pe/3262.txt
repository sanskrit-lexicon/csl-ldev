KAPA¦(S). A company of Asuras. The Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>gives a story of how the brahmins killed these demons.
<div n="lb"/>The Aśvinīdevas once came to the earth and gave eye-
<div n="lb"/>sight to the blind sage Cyavana. It was the time when
<div n="lb"/>Indra had denied Soma juice to the Aśvinīdevas. Sage
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana got back his eyesight and promised the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīdevas that he would lift the ban on wine for
<div n="lb"/>them. Cyavana conducted a Yāga to which the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas were also invited. Indra and the other devas
<div n="lb"/>refused to take the sacrificial wine and butter along
<div n="lb"/>with the Aśvinīdevas. Cyavana got angry and he pro-
<div n="lb"/>duced from the sacrificial fire an Asura named Mada.
<div n="lb"/>With a huge mouth and long teeth the demon went
<div n="lb"/>round eating all the Devas. All at once Cyavana con-
<div n="lb"/>quered the earth and the Kapas subjugated heaven.
<div n="lb"/>When they lost both heaven and earth the Devas
<div n="lb"/>approached the brahmins for help. The brahmins
<div n="lb"/>started a war against the Kapas. The Kapas sent Dhani
<div n="lb"/>to the brahmins for peace-talks. Dhani said “The Kapas
<div n="lb"/>are equal to you, Oh brahmins, and so why do you
<div n="lb"/>fight them? They are well-versed in Vedas and are very
<div n="lb"/>wise men who are entitled to conduct Yāgas. They are
<div n="lb"/>righteous persons similar to Brahmarṣis. Prosperity
<div n="lb"/>lives in them. They never keep unchaste wives nor do
<div n="lb"/>they eat stale meat. It is not proper to fight against
<div n="lb"/>such virtuous persons.”
<div n="NI"/>But the brahmins did not pay heed to what Dhani said
<div n="lb"/>and they killed all the Kapas in bulk. The Kapas,
<div n="lb"/>though they were born Asuras, were good-natured
<div n="lb"/>persons. (Chapter 157, Anuśāsana Parva)
