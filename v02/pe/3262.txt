KAPA¦(S). A company of Asuras. The Mahābhārata
gives a story of how the brahmins killed these demons.
The Aśvinīdevas once came to the earth and gave eye-
sight to the blind sage Cyavana. It was the time when
Indra had denied Soma juice to the Aśvinīdevas. Sage
Cyavana got back his eyesight and promised the
Aśvinīdevas that he would lift the ban on wine for
them. Cyavana conducted a Yāga to which the Aśvinī-
devas were also invited. Indra and the other devas
refused to take the sacrificial wine and butter along
with the Aśvinīdevas. Cyavana got angry and he pro-
duced from the sacrificial fire an Asura named Mada.
With a huge mouth and long teeth the demon went
round eating all the Devas. All at once Cyavana con-
quered the earth and the Kapas subjugated heaven.
When they lost both heaven and earth the Devas
approached the brahmins for help. The brahmins
started a war against the Kapas. The Kapas sent Dhani
to the brahmins for peace-talks. Dhani said “The Kapas
are equal to you, Oh brahmins, and so why do you
fight them? They are well-versed in Vedas and are very
wise men who are entitled to conduct Yāgas. They are
righteous persons similar to Brahmarṣis. Prosperity
lives in them. They never keep unchaste wives nor do
they eat stale meat. It is not proper to fight against
such virtuous persons.”
<div n="NI"/>But the brahmins did not pay heed to what Dhani said
and they killed all the Kapas in bulk. The Kapas,
though they were born Asuras, were good-natured
persons. (Chapter 157, Anuśāsana Parva)
