MĀRKAṆḌEYA¦. The son of Mṛkaṇḍu. He was a great
devotee of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Bhṛgu, son of Brahmā, begot of his wife
Khyāti a daughter named Lakṣmī and two sons named
Dhātā and Vidhātā.
<div n="NI"/>Dhātā and Vidhātā married Āyati and Niyati daughters
of Mahāmeru. Dhātā begot of his wife Āyati a son
named Prāṇa and Niyati bore Vidhātā a son named
Mṛkaṇḍu Mārkaṇḍeya was the son of Mṛkaṇḍu and
Vedaśiras was the son of Mārkaṇḍeya.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Mṛkaṇḍu did not have sons for a long time and
so he performed penance for several years to please Śiva
to get a son. Śiva appeared before him in person and
asked him thus “Do you desire to have a virtuous, wise and
pious son who would live up to sixteen years or a dull-
witted evil-natured son who would live long?” Mṛkaṇḍu
chose the first type and soon a son was born. He was
named Mārkaṇḍeya. Even from boyhood Mārkaṇḍeya
knew all the Vedas and śāstras. His pleasing manners
got the approval of his teachers and the boy was liked by
one and all. But the parents were sad and whenever they
looked at their son a gloom spread over their face. The
secret of the short span of his life was hidden from him.
<div n="NI"/>The sixteenth year was fast approaching and one day
unable to control their grief they wept before him. Mār-
kaṇḍeya asked them the reason why they wept. Mṛkaṇḍu
with tears running down his cheeks told him the story.
From that day onwards Mārkaṇḍeya started performing
penance wearing barks of trees for his dress and growing
matted hair. The boy was soon engrossed in severe aus-
terities.
<div n="NI"/>The day of his death came and the boy sat before the
idol of Śiva in deep meditation. The servants of the god
of Death could not approach Mārkaṇḍeya for the radia-
tion from him was too hot for them. So Yama, the god
of Death, himself came to fetch him. Then Mārkaṇḍeya
crying loudly for help embraced the idol before him.
Yama threw his rope in a loop and it went and circled
round the idol also. Angry Śiva rose from the idol and
[Page488-b+ 65]
coming down killed Yama to save the child. From that
day onwards Śiva got the names Mṛtyuñjaya and Kāla-
kāla. After that at the request of the devas Śiva gave
life to Yama again and made Mārkaṇḍeya to be of six-
teen years for ever.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Penance of Mārkaṇḍeya.%} The Purāṇas state that after
getting the blessing from Śiva, Mārkaṇḍeya lived for ten
crores of years. While he was in deep meditation six
Manvantaras passed away. When Mārkaṇḍeya conti-
nued his meditation to the seventh Manvantara Indra
got frightened and he made an attempt to abort the
penance of Mārkaṇḍeya. Indra sent his troops of
Gandharvas, nymphs, Manmatha and Vasanta to the
āśrama of Mārkaṇḍeya. The āśrama of Mārkaṇḍeya
was at a place which was on the northern side of the
Himālayas and was famous by the presence there of
the river Puṣpabhadrā and the rock Citra. The agents
of Indra came there and tried to entice him with many
temptations. Beautiful celestial maidens danced around
the āśrama. Flowers fell from their hair when their
waists shook by the weight of their heavy breasts. En-
chanting girls played with balls here and there. As they
played the bracelets on their waists fell down and the
thin garments that hid their bodies flew up showing an
alluring nakedness. Kāma (God of Love) sent his arrows
at that time against the sage. But Mārkaṇḍeya sat un-
concerned as rigid as a rock and Indra accepted defeat.
When Indra and his troops returned disappointed Mahā-
viṣṇu with many sages went to Mārkaṇḍeya. He awoke
from his meditation and worshipped Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Vision of Pralaya.%} On one evening at dusk Mārkaṇ-
ḍeya was sitting at Puṣpabhadrātīra when from some-
where a wind began to blow. The wind increased in
strength and the sky became covered with clouds. The
place resounded with peals of thunder and soon it began
to rain. Rains became heavy. Rivers became flooded and
water-level in the oceans rose. Everything around was
submerged in water and Mārkaṇḍeya alone stood there
with his matted hair swinging in the wind. It was im-
possible to know the directions and Mārkaṇḍeya started
walking. He fell into whirlpools but was the next instant
thrown up on to the top of surging waves. Then he saw
on the top of a high wave a banyan tree. On a branch
on the north-east of the tree he saw an infant lying, de-
vouring the darkness by its effulgence. He was attracted
to the infant by its vital force and went inside the infant
as it inhaled. Inside the belly of the kid Mārkaṇḍeya
had a vision of the entire universe. He saw the sky, the
horizon, the stars, the oceans, the mountains expanses of
land, Suras, Asuras, forests and all that the universe
contained in its proper set-up. He saw passing before
his eyes the elements, the Yugas and the Manvantaras.
After some time he was thrown out by an exhalation of
the infant. He stood on the waters. The old banyan
tree was still there. An infant was still lying on a leaf on
that tree. Mārkaṇḍeya then knew it was Mahāviṣṇu.
He rushed to embrace the child; but the child disappear-
ed before he reached it. Mārkaṇḍeya praised Mahā-
viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Pārvatī and Parameśvara come to Mārkaṇḍeya.%} When
Mahāviṣṇu disappeared from his vision he felt he was
sitting at Puṣpabhadrātīra and he again went into
meditation. At that time Pārvatī and Parameśvara came
that way and appeared before Mārkaṇḍeya. The sage
worshipped them and they both blessed Mārkaṇḍeya
[Page489-a+ 64]
and said “Every desire of yours will be fulfilled. You
will never be rugous or grey-haired and will live virtu-
ous and famous till the end of the world. Omniscience
will be an asset for you”. After having said so much
Pārvatī and Parameśvara disappeared. The Purāṇic be-
lief is that the realised soul of Mārkaṇḍeya is moving
about in the universe. (10th Skandha, Chapters 8 to 11,
Bhāgavata).
