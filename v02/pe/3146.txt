KĀLIDĀSA¦. The greatest poet and dramatist in Sans-
krit. Some scholars opine that Kālidāsa flourished in
the 8th Century B.C. while others place his date upto
the period 11th Century A.D. At any rate most of the
scholars consider the period between 1st Century B.C.
and 5th Century A.D. as the most probable date of
the great poet. Some of the main theories in this regard
are as follows;—
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Eighth century B.C.%} Towards the close of Raghu-
vaṃśa Mahākāvya Kālidāsa has referred to the son of
King Agnimitra. Therefore the poet must have lived in
the 8th Century B.C. This is the view of the scholar
Hippolyte Fanche.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Second Century B.C.%} According to Dr. Kuñjan
Rājā Kālidāsa lived in the second Century B.C., the
reasons for the belief being as follows. The poet was a
contemporary of King Agnimitra of the Suṅga dynasty.
This Agnimitra is eulogised in Kālidāsa's Mālavikāgni-
mitra. Agnimitra is referred to in the Bharatavākya
(epilogue) of the drama also.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%First Century B.C.%} The traditional belief is that
Kālidāsa was a member in the assembly of poets and
scholars of the court of emperor Vikramāditya, who
started the Vikrama era in B.C. 56.

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Fifth Century A.D.%} According to Dr. Keith, Kāli-
dāsa lived in the fifth Century A.D. One Candra-
[Page375-a+ 64]
gupta II, who defeated the Śakas in 339 A.D. was
King of Ujjain. He was known as Vikramāditya also.
Dr.Keith thinks that the great poet might have been
a member of this King's court. Perhaps Kālidāsa had
remembered his royal patron Vikramāditya in his
drama called Vikramorvaśīya. Dr. Keith is further of
the view that Kālidāsa composed Kumārasambhava
after attending the birth celebrations of Kumāragupta,
son of King Vikramāditya.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Sixth Century A.D.%} Three scholars, Fergusson, Max
Muller and Kern have opined that Kālidāsa lived in
the sixth Century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>Whichever be the date of Kālidāsa it could be known
from his works that he spent the major part of his life
in Ujjain, and was inextricably indebted to the city in
many ways. Raghuvaṃśa and Kumārasambhava are
his two mahākāvyas. He had also written three dramas,
Abhijñānaśākuntala, Vikramorvaśīya and Mālavikāgni-
mitra and a lyric called Ṛtusaṃhāra. He wrote also a
world-famous poem called Meghasandeśa.
