KRODHA II¦. It is stated in Bhāgavata that Krodha was
<div n="lb"/>born from the eye-brow of Brahmā. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>about this Krodha in the ‘Jaimini-Aśvamedha Parva’.
<div n="NI"/>Once, while the hermit Jamadagni was performing
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial offerings to the Manes, Krodha came there
<div n="lb"/>and secretly put poison in the pudding prepared from
<div n="lb"/>the milk of the sacrificial cow. Even though the hermit
<div n="lb"/>knew this he did not get angry. Seeing this, Krodha
<div n="lb"/>became afraid of the hermit and approaching him said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, hermit! I thought that the Bhārgavas (those
<div n="lb"/>born of the family of Bhṛgu) would get angry quickly.
<div n="lb"/>Now I understand that it is wrong.” Jamadagni pardon-
<div n="lb"/>ed him and said: “But you have to appease the anger
<div n="lb"/>of the Manes”. The Manes cursed him that he would
<div n="lb"/>have to take birth as a mongoose. But he was given
<div n="lb"/>remission that he would be liberated from the curse,
<div n="lb"/>when he narrated the story of the Brahmin Uñcchavṛtti
<div n="lb"/>at the palace of Dharma in the presence of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Krodha regained his former form.
