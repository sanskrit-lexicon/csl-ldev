NALA III¦. A monkey. This monkey was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā. Śrī Rāma and the monkey-army went to
<div n="lb"/>redeem Sītā from Laṅkā and reached the sea-shore. A
<div n="lb"/>bridge had to be made to cross the sea and reach
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā. Immediately Varuṇa the King of the seas
<div n="lb"/>appeared there and said, “Nala who is in the monkey-
<div n="lb"/>army, is the son of Viśvakarmā. His father had given
<div n="lb"/>him a blessing that he would become as expert an
<div n="lb"/>architect as his father. So let the construction of the
<div n="lb"/>bridge be commenced under his supervision.” Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly under the supervision of Nala, Rāma's bridge of
<div n="lb"/>rock was completed and Śrī Rāma and the army of
<div n="lb"/>monkeys reached Laṅkā by walking over this bridge
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 22).
<div n="NI"/>In the battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, Nala fought
<div n="lb"/>with the giant Tuṇḍaka. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>285, Stanza 9).
