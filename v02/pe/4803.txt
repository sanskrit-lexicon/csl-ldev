NIKṢUBHĀ¦. An Apsarā woman about whom the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing story occurs in the Brahmaparva of the Bhaviṣya
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa. On account of the curse of Sūrya, Nikṣubhā, the
<div n="lb"/>great beauty in Svarloka, was born on earth as daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Sujihva a brahmin of Mihira Gotra. At the instance
<div n="lb"/>of her father, she used to keep the yajña fire ever
<div n="lb"/>burning. One day the fire held in her hands abruptly
<div n="lb"/>burst into flames, and her unique beauty revealed in
<div n="lb"/>the light kindled the passion of Sūrya.
<div n="NI"/>Next day Sūrya went to Sujihva and told him that his
[Page538-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>daughter, Nikṣubhā was carrying since he had married
<div n="lb"/>her. As soon as he heard Sūrya's words Sujihva cursed
<div n="lb"/>his daughter thus: “Since the child in your womb is
<div n="lb"/>enveloped by fire the child born to you will be despised
<div n="lb"/>and rejected by people.”
<div n="NI"/>Then Sūrya went to Nikṣubhā and told her that though
<div n="lb"/>her child might be despised he would be a scholar, very
<div n="lb"/>well-bred and eligible for the worship of Agni.
<div n="NI"/>As years passed many children were born to her by Sūrya.
<div n="lb"/>While she was living in the Śāka island Sāmba, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛṣṇa, deputed her sons to perform rites in the Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>temple at Sāmbapura. Nikṣubhā's sons were married to
<div n="lb"/>girls born in the Bhoja family.
