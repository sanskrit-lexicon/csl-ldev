PŪTANĀ I¦. A demoness who was killed by Kṛṣṇa at
Ambāḍi. Her previous birth, her relationship with
Kaṃsa and such other details are found differently in
different Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Kaṃsa and Pūtanā.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Pūtanā was the daughter of a demoness called
Kaitavī and was the servant maid of the wife of
[Page625-a+ 63]
Kaṃsa. She had a younger sister called Vṛkodarī.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Pūtanā was the dhātrī (foster-mother) of Kaṃsa.
She entered Gokula in the form of a bird. (Harivaṃśa,
Chapter 2, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Pūtanā was the sister of Kaṃsa and the wife of
Ghaṭodara. (Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pūrvajanma (previous birth).%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Pūtanā in her previous birth was born as the
daughter of Mahābali bearing the name Ratnamālā.
When Vāmana appeared before Mahābali during the
time of the latter's Yajña, Ratnamālā mentally desired
thus:—“Oh if only this Vāmana became my child! I
could have then breast-fed him.” Vāmana, the omni-
scient, understood the desire of Ratnamālā. So during
the incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, Ratnamālā was born as
Pūtanā and Kṛṣṇa gave her salvation by drinking her
breast-milk. (Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇa, Chapters 4 and
10).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once when the sage Kālabhīru and his daughter
Cārumatī were travelling together they saw the sage
Kakṣīvān doing penance on the shores of the river
Sarasvatī. Kālabhīru saw in Kakṣīvān a suitable
husband for his daughter and so gave Cārumatī in
marriage to him. They were thus living happily to-
gether when once Kakṣīvān had to go on a pilgrimage
alone leaving Cārumatī in his āśrama. Taking advan-
tage of her loneliness a Śūdra made her his concubine
and when Kakṣīvān returned he found out the deceit
and cursed her to be born as a demoness. She begged
for relief and the sage said she would get relief when
Viṣṇu incarnated as Kṛṣṇa. Pūtanā was the cursed
form of Cārumatī. (Chapter 18, Ādi Parva).
