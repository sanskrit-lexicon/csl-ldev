PŪTANĀ I¦. A demoness who was killed by Kṛṣṇa at
<div n="lb"/>Ambāḍi. Her previous birth, her relationship with
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa and such other details are found differently in
<div n="lb"/>different Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Kaṃsa and Pūtanā.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Pūtanā was the daughter of a demoness called
<div n="lb"/>Kaitavī and was the servant maid of the wife of
[Page625-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa. She had a younger sister called Vṛkodarī.
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Pūtanā was the dhātrī (foster-mother) of Kaṃsa.
<div n="lb"/>She entered Gokula in the form of a bird. (Harivaṃśa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 2, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Pūtanā was the sister of Kaṃsa and the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭodara. (Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pūrvajanma (previous birth).%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Pūtanā in her previous birth was born as the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Mahābali bearing the name Ratnamālā.
<div n="lb"/>When Vāmana appeared before Mahābali during the
<div n="lb"/>time of the latter's Yajña, Ratnamālā mentally desired
<div n="lb"/>thus:—“Oh if only this Vāmana became my child! I
<div n="lb"/>could have then breast-fed him.” Vāmana, the omni-
<div n="lb"/>scient, understood the desire of Ratnamālā. So during
<div n="lb"/>the incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, Ratnamālā was born as
<div n="lb"/>Pūtanā and Kṛṣṇa gave her salvation by drinking her
<div n="lb"/>breast-milk. (Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇa, Chapters 4 and
<div n="lb"/>10).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once when the sage Kālabhīru and his daughter
<div n="lb"/>Cārumatī were travelling together they saw the sage
<div n="lb"/>Kakṣīvān doing penance on the shores of the river
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī. Kālabhīru saw in Kakṣīvān a suitable
<div n="lb"/>husband for his daughter and so gave Cārumatī in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to him. They were thus living happily to-
<div n="lb"/>gether when once Kakṣīvān had to go on a pilgrimage
<div n="lb"/>alone leaving Cārumatī in his āśrama. Taking advan-
<div n="lb"/>tage of her loneliness a Śūdra made her his concubine
<div n="lb"/>and when Kakṣīvān returned he found out the deceit
<div n="lb"/>and cursed her to be born as a demoness. She begged
<div n="lb"/>for relief and the sage said she would get relief when
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu incarnated as Kṛṣṇa. Pūtanā was the cursed
<div n="lb"/>form of Cārumatī. (Chapter 18, Ādi Parva).
