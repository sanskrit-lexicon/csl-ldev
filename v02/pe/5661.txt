RAMBHĀ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} One of the most beautiful of the apsarā
women. Urvaśī, Tilottamā and Rambhā are really
reputed for their beauty.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} All the famous Celestial women were daughters
of Kaśyapaprajāpati by his wife Pradhā. Devarṣi
(Kaśyapa) begot the following daughters of his wife
Pradhā i.e. Alambuṣā, Miśrakeśī, Vidyutparṇā, Tilottamā,
Aruṇā, Rakṣitā, Rambhā, Manoramā, Subāhū, Keśinī,
Suratā and Surajā. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Rāvaṇa cursed.%} Rāvaṇa raped Rambhā and Nala-
kūbara cursed him. (See under Nalakūbara)
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Purūravas and Rambhā.%} Indra once killed an asura
chief named Māyādhara and held a festival in honour
of the victory. At the festival Rambhā danced before
her preceptor Tumburu. Purūravas too was present on
the occasion and he ridiculed Rambhā for her mistakes
in dancing. Moreover he claimed that he was a greater
master of dance than Tumburu preceptor of Rambhā.
Enraged by this claim Tumburu cursed that Purūravas
would be separated from his wife Urvaśī. (Kathāsarit-
sāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga 3).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Rambhā and Suṣeṇa.%} There was a King called Suṣeṇa
on mount Citrakūṭa. This handsome bachelor prince
used to sit alone in the lotus pond near his palace. When
once Rambhā passed through the sky above the pond
her eyes met those of Suṣeṇa and she alighted on the
spot and the long talk between the two ended in their
marriage. Suṣeṇa enjoyed life there for a long time with
Rambhā without knowing that she was an apsarā
woman. He had attempted many a time to know the
real facts about her, to no purpose. Rambhā did
not even think about her native Svarga. Her com-
panion, a Yakṣī, showered gold all over Suṣeṇa's
[Page642-a+ 65]
kingdom. In due course Rambhā delivered a beautiful
female child and then she told the King that she was
Rambhā and that she had continued as his wife till
then as she felt love towards him. She further told him
that now she had begot a daughter, she was leaving
him and that she had a curse upon her which had been
redeemed now. She also assured him that they would
meet in Svarga in case the daughter was duly wedded.
Rambhā departed to Svarga. Suṣeṇa named the
child Sulocanā and when she came of age he married
her to Vatsamaharṣi and then went to Devaloka where
he lived happily with Rambhā for a long time. (Kathā-
saritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, Taraṅga 2).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) The powerful asura called Caturāsya once felt a
great yearning for Rambhā and her maid Svayam-
prabhā managed things for him. He built a garden-city
and presented it to Svayamprabhā in return for her
service stated above. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The Sage Gautama alias Śaradvān experienced
seminal emission on seeing Rambhā and from the
semen was born Kṛpī whom in due course of time
Droṇācārya married. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañ-
cukālambaka, Taraṅga 6).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Indra once deputed Rambhā to break the vigorous
tapas Viśvāmitra was observing. She approached him
in the guise of a nightingale and with her song dis-
turbed his meditation. The muni cursed her as follows
and turned her into a rock. “Oh! evil woman Rambhā,
you have cheated me, who have mastered desire and
anger and so you be turned into a rock for a thousand
years. The great brahmin ascetic, Bhūritejas will ab-
solve you from my curse and you will then resume your
own form.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 64).
