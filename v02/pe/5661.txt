RAMBHĀ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} One of the most beautiful of the apsarā
<div n="lb"/>women. Urvaśī, Tilottamā and Rambhā are really
<div n="lb"/>reputed for their beauty.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} All the famous Celestial women were daughters
<div n="lb"/>of Kaśyapaprajāpati by his wife Pradhā. Devarṣi
<div n="lb"/>(Kaśyapa) begot the following daughters of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Pradhā i.e. Alambuṣā, Miśrakeśī, Vidyutparṇā, Tilottamā,
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇā, Rakṣitā, Rambhā, Manoramā, Subāhū, Keśinī,
<div n="lb"/>Suratā and Surajā. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Rāvaṇa cursed.%} Rāvaṇa raped Rambhā and Nala-
<div n="lb"/>kūbara cursed him. (See under Nalakūbara)
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Purūravas and Rambhā.%} Indra once killed an asura
<div n="lb"/>chief named Māyādhara and held a festival in honour
<div n="lb"/>of the victory. At the festival Rambhā danced before
<div n="lb"/>her preceptor Tumburu. Purūravas too was present on
<div n="lb"/>the occasion and he ridiculed Rambhā for her mistakes
<div n="lb"/>in dancing. Moreover he claimed that he was a greater
<div n="lb"/>master of dance than Tumburu preceptor of Rambhā.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged by this claim Tumburu cursed that Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>would be separated from his wife Urvaśī. (Kathāsarit-
<div n="lb"/>sāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga 3).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Rambhā and Suṣeṇa.%} There was a King called Suṣeṇa
<div n="lb"/>on mount Citrakūṭa. This handsome bachelor prince
<div n="lb"/>used to sit alone in the lotus pond near his palace. When
<div n="lb"/>once Rambhā passed through the sky above the pond
<div n="lb"/>her eyes met those of Suṣeṇa and she alighted on the
<div n="lb"/>spot and the long talk between the two ended in their
<div n="lb"/>marriage. Suṣeṇa enjoyed life there for a long time with
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā without knowing that she was an apsarā
<div n="lb"/>woman. He had attempted many a time to know the
<div n="lb"/>real facts about her, to no purpose. Rambhā did
<div n="lb"/>not even think about her native Svarga. Her com-
<div n="lb"/>panion, a Yakṣī, showered gold all over Suṣeṇa's
[Page642-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>kingdom. In due course Rambhā delivered a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>female child and then she told the King that she was
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā and that she had continued as his wife till
<div n="lb"/>then as she felt love towards him. She further told him
<div n="lb"/>that now she had begot a daughter, she was leaving
<div n="lb"/>him and that she had a curse upon her which had been
<div n="lb"/>redeemed now. She also assured him that they would
<div n="lb"/>meet in Svarga in case the daughter was duly wedded.
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā departed to Svarga. Suṣeṇa named the
<div n="lb"/>child Sulocanā and when she came of age he married
<div n="lb"/>her to Vatsamaharṣi and then went to Devaloka where
<div n="lb"/>he lived happily with Rambhā for a long time. (Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, Taraṅga 2).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) The powerful asura called Caturāsya once felt a
<div n="lb"/>great yearning for Rambhā and her maid Svayam-
<div n="lb"/>prabhā managed things for him. He built a garden-city
<div n="lb"/>and presented it to Svayamprabhā in return for her
<div n="lb"/>service stated above. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The Sage Gautama alias Śaradvān experienced
<div n="lb"/>seminal emission on seeing Rambhā and from the
<div n="lb"/>semen was born Kṛpī whom in due course of time
<div n="lb"/>Droṇācārya married. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañ-
<div n="lb"/>cukālambaka, Taraṅga 6).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Indra once deputed Rambhā to break the vigorous
<div n="lb"/>tapas Viśvāmitra was observing. She approached him
<div n="lb"/>in the guise of a nightingale and with her song dis-
<div n="lb"/>turbed his meditation. The muni cursed her as follows
<div n="lb"/>and turned her into a rock. “Oh! evil woman Rambhā,
<div n="lb"/>you have cheated me, who have mastered desire and
<div n="lb"/>anger and so you be turned into a rock for a thousand
<div n="lb"/>years. The great brahmin ascetic, Bhūritejas will ab-
<div n="lb"/>solve you from my curse and you will then resume your
<div n="lb"/>own form.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 64).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Rambhā gave a dance performance on the occa-
<div n="lb"/>sion of the birthday celebrations of Arjuna. (Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 122, Verse 62).
<div n="NI"/>(v) She had lived for sometime in the court of Kubera
<div n="lb"/>serving him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 10).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) When Arjuna lived in Svarga as Indra's guest
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā danced in honour of the former. (Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 29).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) On another occasion she danced in Kubera's court
<div n="lb"/>in honour of Aṣṭāvakra muni. (Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 19, Verse 44).
