GHṚTĀCĪ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} She was an exceptionally beautiful apsarā
woman, and she revelled in disturbing the peace of
the sages and becoming mother of children by them.
Ghṛtācī, who succeeded in breaking the penance of
the sages like Kuśanābha, Vyāsa and Bharadvāja
occupied a very prominent position among apsarā
women.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śuka, the son of Vyāsa.%} Vyāsa longed very much to have
a son. Ultimately, after receiving instruction and advice
from Nārada, he reached the peaks of Mahāmeru and
worshipped Mahādeva and Mahādevī for one year
with the one-syllabled mantra OM which is the very
seed of word. By now the great tejas (effulgence) of
Vyāsa lighted up the whole world and Indra got ner-
vous and upset. The great Lord Śiva appeared on the
scene and blessed Vyāsa that he will have a son who
would become a very wise man, very much interested
in helping others, and very famous also. Vyāsa returned
gratified to his āśrama. One day, while in the process
of preparing the sticks for producing fire, thoughts
[Page291-b+ 64]
about a son passed through his mind. Fire is produced by
the rubbing of two sticks. But, he thought, how
could he who had no wife, become the father of a son?
While immersed in such thoughts he saw Ghṛtācī
standing near him, herself having come along the sky.
Vyāsa did not like the presence of Ghṛtācī. Fearing
the curse of Vyāsa she assumed the form of a parrot and
flew away.
<div n="NI"/>The beauty of Ghṛtācī as also the flight of the parrot
kindled erotic feelings in Vyāsa and seminal emission
occurred. The semen fell on the stick used for produc-
ing fire, and without knowing the fact he went on
using the sticks for producing fire. And, then did
appear from it a son of divine lustre. That son became
reputed in later years as sage Śuka. (Devī Bhāga-
vata, Prathama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Two children by Bharadvāja.%} Once sage Bharadvāja was
taking his bath in the Gaṅgā, Ghṛtācī also came to
bathe. On the banks of the river her clothes caught
something and were removed from their position. The
sight of it caused seminal emission to the Sage. The
semen thus emitted was kept in a Droṇa, (bamboo cup)
and when it was due the Droṇa broke and out
of it came a child. It was this child which, in later
years, became so very famous as the great Droṇācārya.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 149). On another occasion also,
the sight of Ghṛtācī caused emission in Bharadvāja,
and Śrutāvatī or Śruvāvatī was the noble daughter
born out of it. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 63).
<div n="NI"/>{%Hundred daughters of Kuśanābha.%} Kuśanābha, son of Kuśa
was a saintly king. Once Kuśanābha fell in love with
Ghṛtācī and a hundred daughters were born to him
of her. Once Wind-God felt enamoured of the
hundred girls, but they refused to satisfy his desire. So
he cursed them to become crooked or bent down in body.
Later on, Brahmadatta, son of the sage Cūli, straightened
their bodies and married them. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bāla Kāṇḍa, Canto 32).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Birth of Ruru.%} On another occasion Ghṛtācī attract-
ed and subjugated a King called Pramati. Ruru was the
son born to Pramati by Ghṛtācī.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other information.%} (1) Once Ghṛtācī pleased Sage
Aṣṭāvakra, who introduced her into Kubera's assembly.
(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 44).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Ghṛtācī danced at the birthday celebrations of
Arjuna. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 65).
<div n="NI"/>(3) A daughter called Citrāṅgadā was born to Viśvakar-
man by Ghṛtācī. (See under Viśvakarmā).
<div n="NI"/>(4) A daughter called Devavatī was born to Ghṛtācī.
(See under Devavatī).
