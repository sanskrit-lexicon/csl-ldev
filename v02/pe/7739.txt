UPAMANYU II¦. In the Kṛtayuga, there lived a hermit
<div n="lb"/>named Vyāghrapāda who had two sons. They were
<div n="lb"/>called Upamanyu and Dhaumya. Some learned men
<div n="lb"/>are of opinion that Upamanyu the son of Vyāghrapāda
<div n="lb"/>and Upamanyu the disciple of Ayodhadhaumya, were
<div n="lb"/>one and the same. Once Upamanyu visited another her-
<div n="lb"/>mitage along with his father. He happened to drink the
<div n="lb"/>milk of the cow there. After that they returned to their
<div n="lb"/>own hermitage, Upamanyu went to his mother and
<div n="lb"/>asked her to make milk pudding for him. But the
<div n="lb"/>mother felt very sorry because there was no milk. At
<div n="lb"/>last she mixed flour in water and made pudding and
<div n="lb"/>gave it to him. Upamanyu did not accept it. His mother
<div n="lb"/>told him that there was no way to get milk and that men
<div n="lb"/>could get wealth, crops etc. only by the grace of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Upamanyu who was of a wilful nature did penance
<div n="lb"/>with meditation and contemplation on Śiva. Finally
<div n="lb"/>Śiva appeared before him in the shape of Indra and
<div n="lb"/>told him to ask for his boon. Upamanyu boldly replied
<div n="lb"/>that he wanted no boon from anybody else except Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva made his appearance in his own form and made
<div n="lb"/>Upamanyu a deva (God).
<div n="NI"/>Upamanyu said all these things when he talked with
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>In the Book “Our hermits,” written by Rāmasvāmi
<div n="lb"/>Śāstrī in Tamil, it is mentioned that Upamanyu had
<div n="lb"/>written a book “Śiva bhaktavilāsa” in which biogra-
<div n="lb"/>phies of devotees of Śiva of great attainments are given.
