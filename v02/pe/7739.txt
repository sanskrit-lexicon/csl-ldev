UPAMANYU II¦. In the Kṛtayuga, there lived a hermit
named Vyāghrapāda who had two sons. They were
called Upamanyu and Dhaumya. Some learned men
are of opinion that Upamanyu the son of Vyāghrapāda
and Upamanyu the disciple of Ayodhadhaumya, were
one and the same. Once Upamanyu visited another her-
mitage along with his father. He happened to drink the
milk of the cow there. After that they returned to their
own hermitage, Upamanyu went to his mother and
asked her to make milk pudding for him. But the
mother felt very sorry because there was no milk. At
last she mixed flour in water and made pudding and
gave it to him. Upamanyu did not accept it. His mother
told him that there was no way to get milk and that men
could get wealth, crops etc. only by the grace of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Upamanyu who was of a wilful nature did penance
with meditation and contemplation on Śiva. Finally
Śiva appeared before him in the shape of Indra and
told him to ask for his boon. Upamanyu boldly replied
that he wanted no boon from anybody else except Śiva.
Śiva made his appearance in his own form and made
Upamanyu a deva (God).
<div n="NI"/>Upamanyu said all these things when he talked with
Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>In the Book “Our hermits,” written by Rāmasvāmi
Śāstrī in Tamil, it is mentioned that Upamanyu had
written a book “Śiva bhaktavilāsa” in which biogra-
phies of devotees of Śiva of great attainments are given.
