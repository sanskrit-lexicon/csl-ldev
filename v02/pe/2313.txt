GAṆAPATI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} A son of Śiva with face like that of an
<div n="lb"/>elephant. As Śiva has appointed this son as chief of
<div n="lb"/>the gaṇas (attendants) he is called Gaṇapati.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%His birth.%} While Śiva and Pārvatī assumed the form
<div n="lb"/>of monkeys and enjoyed themselves in the forest Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>got pregnant, and Śiva took the semen from the womb
<div n="lb"/>and gave it to Vāyu (wind God.) Vāyu deposited it in
<div n="lb"/>the womb of Añjanā, who delivered a son named Hanū-
<div n="lb"/>mān. Śiva assumed the form of an elephant (tusker)
[Page273-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and Pārvatī that of a she-elephant. Pārvatī delivered a
<div n="lb"/>son in the form of an elephant. That son was named
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%His tusk broken.%} Once Paraśurāma arrived at Kailāsa
<div n="lb"/>to meet Śiva. At that time Śiva was asleep. So Gaṇa-
<div n="lb"/>pati did not allow him to get in. A duel broke out
<div n="lb"/>between them. In that duel one of Gaṇapati's tusks
<div n="lb"/>was broken. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gaṇapati turned into crow.%} An exceptionally hot
<div n="lb"/>summer set in once in South India. The whole land
<div n="lb"/>became parched. So Agastya went to Śiva and request-
<div n="lb"/>ed for some holy water, and the Lord put Kāverī who
<div n="lb"/>was worshipping him just then, in the Kamaṇḍalu
<div n="lb"/>(something like a teapot which sannyāsins carry with
<div n="lb"/>them) of Agastya and sent him back. Indra, who did
<div n="lb"/>not relish this action of Śiva, asked Gaṇapati to some
<div n="lb"/>how or other upset Agastya's Kamaṇḍalu of holy water,
<div n="lb"/>and Gaṇapati, in the guise of a crow went and sat on
<div n="lb"/>the brink of the Kamaṇḍalu and thus upset it. Agastya
<div n="lb"/>and the crow quarrelled with each other. Then did the
<div n="lb"/>crow assume its original form as Gaṇapati and blessed
<div n="lb"/>Agastya. Moreover, Gaṇapati filled Agastya's Kamaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍalu with holy water, which the latter distributed
<div n="lb"/>among devotees in South India, and that is the present
<div n="lb"/>Kāverī river.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other stories about Gaṇapati's head.%} The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>contain two different stories as to how Gaṇapati hap-
<div n="lb"/>pened to have the elephant's head. Once Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>pointed out to Gaṇapati the planet Saturn, and his head
<div n="lb"/>got burned down due to the ocular power of Saturn,
<div n="lb"/>and according to one story Gaṇapati's head thus lost
<div n="lb"/>was replaced with that of an elephant. The other story
<div n="lb"/>is more interesting. When once Śiva tried to enter the
<div n="lb"/>room where Pārvatī had gone to take her bath clad in
<div n="lb"/>a single clothing Gaṇapati prevented Śiva from doing
<div n="lb"/>so. Śiva, enraged at the obstruction made by Gaṇapati,
<div n="lb"/>cut off his head, and when his anger was cooled down
<div n="lb"/>he replaced Gaṇapati's lost head with that of an ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Wedding of Gaṇapati.%} Gaṇapati has two wives called
<div n="lb"/>Siddhi and Buddhi.
<div n="NI"/>When Gaṇapati and Subrahmaṇya attained the age of
<div n="lb"/>marriage they were in a hurry to get married. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>conducted a test. Śiva and Pārvatī told them that he
<div n="lb"/>who returned first after going round the world would be
<div n="lb"/>married first. Accordingly Subrahmaṇya mounted his
<div n="lb"/>vehicle (peacock) and set out for a tour round the
<div n="lb"/>world. Gaṇapati did nothing of the sort. But after a
<div n="lb"/>little time he went round his parents, viz., Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī. Asked for an explanation about his action
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati replied that since the whole universe existed
<div n="lb"/>in Śiva and Pārvatī, going around them was tantamount
<div n="lb"/>to touring round the world. Pleased at this reply his
<div n="lb"/>parents got Gaṇapati married first.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Vighneśvaratvam.%} (Power to remove all obstacles).
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati is called Vighneśvara because he is the god
<div n="lb"/>who removes all obstacles from the paths of men or
<div n="lb"/>creates them.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇapati has the power to get anything done without
<div n="lb"/>any obstructions as also the power to put obstacles in
<div n="lb"/>the path of anything being got done. Therefore, the
<div n="lb"/>custom came into vogue of worshipping Gaṇapati at the
<div n="lb"/>very commencement of any action for its completion
<div n="lb"/>without any hitch or hindrance. Actions begun with
[Page273-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>such worship would be duly completed, Indians believe.
<div n="lb"/>In support of that belief the following story from the
<div n="lb"/>6th taraṅga of Lāvāṇakalaṃbakam, Kathāsaritsāgara
<div n="lb"/>may be quoted.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas decided to appoint Subrahmaṇya as chief
<div n="lb"/>of the army to kill Tārakāsura. When Indra took up
<div n="lb"/>the pot of water purified by mantras to anoint Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya's head with it, his hands became benumbed, and
<div n="lb"/>he stood aghast. Then Śiva said that any action begun
<div n="lb"/>without Gaṇapati pūjā would meet with such obstacles.
<div n="lb"/>At once Indra worshipped Gaṇapati and his hands
<div n="lb"/>recovered from the paralysed condition. And, Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya was duly anointed with the holy water.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Gaṇapati wrote the Ṃahābhārata.%} After the death of
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas sage Vyāsa entered
<div n="lb"/>again into meditation. But, the whole story of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata reflected in the mirror of his mind. He wanted
<div n="lb"/>to translate the story into a great poem and requested
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā to suggest a suitable person to write the story
<div n="lb"/>on his dictation, and Brahmā suggested Gaṇapati's
<div n="lb"/>name. Then Vyāsa thought about Gaṇapati and he
<div n="lb"/>appeared before the sage. But, Gaṇapati did not appre-
<div n="lb"/>ciate the idea of serving as Vyāsa's scribe. So he stipu-
<div n="lb"/>lated a condition that he would write down the poem
<div n="lb"/>provided Vyāsa dictated it in such a manner that he
<div n="lb"/>had not to lay down his pen even once before the epic
<div n="lb"/>was completed. To this Vyāsa stipulated the counter
<div n="lb"/>condition that when he dictated without the least inter-
<div n="lb"/>ruption or pause Gaṇapati should not write down the
<div n="lb"/>matter without understanding the meaning of it. And,
<div n="lb"/>under such conditions the composition of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata was completed within three years. (Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1, Verses 74-80).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Gaṇapati pūja.%} Gaṇapati occupies the most promi-
<div n="lb"/>nent place among the Devas connected with Śiva. In
<div n="lb"/>South India, Gaṇapati pūjā came into vogue in the 6th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D., and idols of Gaṇapati now extant might
<div n="lb"/>have been made at that period. In South India, temples
<div n="lb"/>dedicated to Gaṇapati are in no way less in number
<div n="lb"/>than those to Subrahmaṇya. The idol of Gaṇapati is
<div n="lb"/>installed at the gateways of villages and forts, under
<div n="lb"/>the fig tree, at the entrance of temples and at the south-
<div n="lb"/>western corner of Śiva temples. Two types of idols are
<div n="lb"/>important: the Itaṃpiri (the proboscis turned to the
<div n="lb"/>left side) and the Valaṃpiri (the proboscis turned to
<div n="lb"/>the right side). It is stated that the enormously big
<div n="lb"/>belly of Gaṇapati contains in it the whole universe.
