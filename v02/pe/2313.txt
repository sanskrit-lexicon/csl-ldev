GAṆAPATI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} A son of Śiva with face like that of an
elephant. As Śiva has appointed this son as chief of
the gaṇas (attendants) he is called Gaṇapati.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%His birth.%} While Śiva and Pārvatī assumed the form
of monkeys and enjoyed themselves in the forest Pārvatī
got pregnant, and Śiva took the semen from the womb
and gave it to Vāyu (wind God.) Vāyu deposited it in
the womb of Añjanā, who delivered a son named Hanū-
mān. Śiva assumed the form of an elephant (tusker)
[Page273-a+ 64]
and Pārvatī that of a she-elephant. Pārvatī delivered a
son in the form of an elephant. That son was named
Gaṇapati. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%His tusk broken.%} Once Paraśurāma arrived at Kailāsa
to meet Śiva. At that time Śiva was asleep. So Gaṇa-
pati did not allow him to get in. A duel broke out
between them. In that duel one of Gaṇapati's tusks
was broken. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gaṇapati turned into crow.%} An exceptionally hot
summer set in once in South India. The whole land
became parched. So Agastya went to Śiva and request-
ed for some holy water, and the Lord put Kāverī who
was worshipping him just then, in the Kamaṇḍalu
(something like a teapot which sannyāsins carry with
them) of Agastya and sent him back. Indra, who did
not relish this action of Śiva, asked Gaṇapati to some
how or other upset Agastya's Kamaṇḍalu of holy water,
and Gaṇapati, in the guise of a crow went and sat on
the brink of the Kamaṇḍalu and thus upset it. Agastya
and the crow quarrelled with each other. Then did the
crow assume its original form as Gaṇapati and blessed
Agastya. Moreover, Gaṇapati filled Agastya's Kamaṇ-
ḍalu with holy water, which the latter distributed
among devotees in South India, and that is the present
Kāverī river.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other stories about Gaṇapati's head.%} The Purāṇas
contain two different stories as to how Gaṇapati hap-
pened to have the elephant's head. Once Pārvatī
pointed out to Gaṇapati the planet Saturn, and his head
got burned down due to the ocular power of Saturn,
and according to one story Gaṇapati's head thus lost
was replaced with that of an elephant. The other story
is more interesting. When once Śiva tried to enter the
room where Pārvatī had gone to take her bath clad in
a single clothing Gaṇapati prevented Śiva from doing
so. Śiva, enraged at the obstruction made by Gaṇapati,
cut off his head, and when his anger was cooled down
he replaced Gaṇapati's lost head with that of an ele-
phant. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Wedding of Gaṇapati.%} Gaṇapati has two wives called
Siddhi and Buddhi.
<div n="NI"/>When Gaṇapati and Subrahmaṇya attained the age of
marriage they were in a hurry to get married. Śiva
conducted a test. Śiva and Pārvatī told them that he
who returned first after going round the world would be
married first. Accordingly Subrahmaṇya mounted his
vehicle (peacock) and set out for a tour round the
world. Gaṇapati did nothing of the sort. But after a
little time he went round his parents, viz., Śiva and
Pārvatī. Asked for an explanation about his action
Gaṇapati replied that since the whole universe existed
in Śiva and Pārvatī, going around them was tantamount
to touring round the world. Pleased at this reply his
parents got Gaṇapati married first.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Vighneśvaratvam.%} (Power to remove all obstacles).
Gaṇapati is called Vighneśvara because he is the god
who removes all obstacles from the paths of men or
creates them.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇapati has the power to get anything done without
any obstructions as also the power to put obstacles in
the path of anything being got done. Therefore, the
custom came into vogue of worshipping Gaṇapati at the
very commencement of any action for its completion
without any hitch or hindrance. Actions begun with
[Page273-b+ 64]
such worship would be duly completed, Indians believe.
In support of that belief the following story from the
6th taraṅga of Lāvāṇakalaṃbakam, Kathāsaritsāgara
may be quoted.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas decided to appoint Subrahmaṇya as chief
of the army to kill Tārakāsura. When Indra took up
the pot of water purified by mantras to anoint Subrah-
maṇya's head with it, his hands became benumbed, and
he stood aghast. Then Śiva said that any action begun
without Gaṇapati pūjā would meet with such obstacles.
At once Indra worshipped Gaṇapati and his hands
recovered from the paralysed condition. And, Subrah-
maṇya was duly anointed with the holy water.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Gaṇapati wrote the Ṃahābhārata.%} After the death of
the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas sage Vyāsa entered
again into meditation. But, the whole story of the
Bhārata reflected in the mirror of his mind. He wanted
to translate the story into a great poem and requested
Brahmā to suggest a suitable person to write the story
on his dictation, and Brahmā suggested Gaṇapati's
name. Then Vyāsa thought about Gaṇapati and he
appeared before the sage. But, Gaṇapati did not appre-
ciate the idea of serving as Vyāsa's scribe. So he stipu-
lated a condition that he would write down the poem
provided Vyāsa dictated it in such a manner that he
had not to lay down his pen even once before the epic
was completed. To this Vyāsa stipulated the counter
condition that when he dictated without the least inter-
ruption or pause Gaṇapati should not write down the
matter without understanding the meaning of it. And,
under such conditions the composition of the Mahā-
bhārata was completed within three years. (Ādi Parva,
Chapter 1, Verses 74-80).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Gaṇapati pūja.%} Gaṇapati occupies the most promi-
nent place among the Devas connected with Śiva. In
South India, Gaṇapati pūjā came into vogue in the 6th
century A.D., and idols of Gaṇapati now extant might
have been made at that period. In South India, temples
dedicated to Gaṇapati are in no way less in number
than those to Subrahmaṇya. The idol of Gaṇapati is
installed at the gateways of villages and forts, under
the fig tree, at the entrance of temples and at the south-
western corner of Śiva temples. Two types of idols are
important: the Itaṃpiri (the proboscis turned to the
left side) and the Valaṃpiri (the proboscis turned to
the right side). It is stated that the enormously big
belly of Gaṇapati contains in it the whole universe.
