PURŪRAVAS¦. I. A prominent king of Candravaṃśa
(lunar race).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin of Candravaṃśa and birth of Purūravas.%} Descend-
ing in order from Brahmā came Atri—Candra—Budha
Purūravas. The dynasty which came from Candra was
called the Candravaṃśa. Though Budha was the first
king of Candravaṃśa it was Purūravas who became
celebrated. The story of the birth of Purūravas is given
below:
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā in the beginning deputed the sage Atri for the
work of creation. Atrimaharṣi started the penance
called anuttara to acquire sufficient power for creation.
After some years Saccidānanda brahma with an aura of
lustre reflected in the heart of that pure and serene
soul. In sheer ecstasy tears rolled down his cheeks and
the glittering flow of water was lustfully drunk by the
zones taking the form of women with a view to produc-
ing progenies. They became pregnant but were un-
able to bear the embryo of Atri and so they threw them
away. Brahmā took them all and made them into one
armoured youth and took him in his chariot to his land.
Then the brahmarṣis requested Brahmā to make him
their lord. When the rṣis, devas, gandharvas and
nymphs praised him reciting sāmaveda the majestic
lustre of the youth increased. It was from this that
auṣadhas (medicines) originated and that is why
Candra is considered to be the lord of medicines, dvija
and Vedasvarūpa. The Candramaṇḍala is full of
chemicals. It increases and decreases according to the
white half and black half of the moon-based month.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa gave in marriage to Candra twentyseven beauti-
ful maidens. Then Candra did penance meditating
on Viṣṇu for ten thousand Kalpas. Viṣṇu pleased by
his penance asked him to name a boon and Candra said
“When I perform a yāga in svarga all the devas like
Brahmā should come in person to my yāgaśālā and
take the yāgabhāga. Śūlapāṇi should remain as a
watchman at my Rājasūya.” Accordingly with the
blessing of Viṣṇu, Candra conducted the yāga in which
Atri, Bhṛgu, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Devas, Vasus, Maruts
and Viśvadevas took part. Candra gave as yāga-fees
to Ṛtviks all the three worlds. The yāga was complete
and when Candra rose up after a bath nine devīs fell in
love with the amorous beauty of Candra. Lakṣmī, wife
of Viṣṇu, Sinīvālī, wife of Kardama, Dyuti, wife of
Vibhāvasu, Puṣṭi, wife of Dhātā, Prabhā, wife of
Sūrya, Kuhū, wife of Haviṣmān, Kīrti, wife of Jayanta,
Aṃśumālī wife of Kaśyapa and Dhṛti wife of Nanda,
abandoned their husbands and went with Candra.
Candra treated them all as his own wives and gave
them erotic pleasure to their hearts' content. Those
who saw this non-virtuous act stood dumbfounded un-
able to curse Candra.
<div n="NI"/>Attracted by the dazzling brilliance of Candra Tārā,
wife of Bṛhaspati, went with him. Enraged at this, Bṛhas-
pati joining with other devas prepared for a fight
against Candra. Devas took sides and by the media-
tion of Indra a conference of both the parties was
held and Tārā was sent back to Bṛhaspati. Tārā was
pregnant then and Tārā confessed that the child in her
womb was that of Candra. So when that child was
[Page620-b+ 63]
born Candra took it away and named it Budha. Brahmā
and other ṛṣis gave Budha a seat among the planets.
<div n="NI"/>Budha married Ilā and they got a son named Purūravas.
(See under Ilā). After that Budha performed a hundred
Aśvamedhayāgas. He then enjoyed world prosperity
as lord of Saptadvīpa living in the beautiful Himādri-
śṛṅga. worshipping Brahmā. (Chapter 12, Bhāga 3,
Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Testing Purūravas and the curse.%} Purūravas by his bril-
liance performed a hundred Aśvamedhayāgas and lived
in glory at Himādriśṛṅga. Great demons like Keśī
became his servants. Urvaśī attracted by his beauty
became his wife. While he was living like that Dharma,
Artha and Kāma went in disguise to his palace to test
him. Hereceived them all well but paid more attention to
Dharma. Artha and Kāma got angry and cursed him.
Artha cursed him saying that he would be ruined by
his greed and Kāma cursed him saying he would go
mad by being separated from Urvaśī. Hearing that
Dharma blessed him thus: “You will live long lead-
ing a virtuous life. Your race will increase and
remain in glory till the end of the moon and the stars.
The insanity caused by your passion for Urvaśī would
end by the end of sixty years. That celestial maiden
would remain then with you for one Manvantara.”
(Chapter 12, Bhāga 3, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Purūravas used to visit Indra daily. One day while he
was going through air well-armed with a bow and
arrows he saw a demon named Keśī carrying away
by force Urvaśī and Citralekhā and after defeating
Keśī in a fight recovered the nymphs and gave them
back to Indra. Indra praised Purūravas and in his
honour a drama, Lakṣmīsvayaṃvara, was enacted by
Urvaśī, Menakā and others. Urvaśī taking the part of
Lakṣmī started to dance but seeing Purūravas before
her she became lustful and made wrong steps. Nārada
who was present at the function got angry and cursed her
“You will forget all you have learnt. Not only that,
you will live as a creeper separated from Purūravas for
a period of sixty years.” (For details see under Urvaśī).
Padma Purāṇa says that it was Bharata who cursed
Urvaśī. This story is slightly different from that found
in the other Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sons of Purūravas.%} Urvaśī got eight sons of Purūravas
named Āyus, Dṛḍhāyus, Vaśyāyus, Danāyus, Vṛttimān,
Vasu, Divijāta and Subāhu. Of these Āyus became the
propagator of the dynasty. Of the sons born to Āyus
five sons, Nahuṣa, Vṛddhaśarmā, Raji, Dambha and
Vipāpmā became celebrities. A hundred sons were
born to Raji. They were called Rājeyas. (Chapter 12,
Bhāga 3, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Some Purāṇas state that Purūravas had six sons while
some state that he had seven sons.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%} The following references are made
about him in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once Purūravas stole the wealth of some brahmins.
The brahmins took Sanatkumāra along with them and
made representations to the king. Purūravas did not
give back their wealth. The brahmins cursed him and as
a result the prosperity of the King waned. Then Purū-
ravas brought down from svarga three Agnis and per-
formed a yāga and thus regained his lost splendour
and prosperity. (Chapter 75, Ādi Parva).
[Page621-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Purūravas got six sons of Urvaśī named Āyus,
Dhīmān, Amāvasu, Dṛḍhāyus, Vanāyus and Śatāyus.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once he asked Vāyu the wind-god about the origin
of the four castes and the superiority of the brahmins
over other castes. (Śloka 3, Chapter 72, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) At another time he discussed about yajñapurohitas
with Kaśyapa. (Chapter 73, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Ikṣvāku gave Purūravas a sword which in his old
age he gave to his son Āyus. (Chapter 166, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) He once declared that one can attain svarga by
the blessings of brahmins. (Śloka 31, Chapter 6, Anu-
śāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Purūravas was famous as a donor of cows. (Śloka
26, Chapter 76, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Purūravas never ate meat. (Śloka 65, Chapter
111, Anuśāsana Parva).
