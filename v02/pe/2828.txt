JALADHI¦. The crocodile which is the conveyance of
Varuṇa. It is mentioned in Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 9,
about conveyances of Gods as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“The conveyance of Indra is the white elephant, which
came into being from the palm of Danu, and is of
extraordinary strength and valour. The black buffalo
called Pauṇḍraka, which was born from the thigh of
Rudra, and is as quick as the mind and very fierce, is
the conveyance of Yama (the god of death). The
conveyance of Varuṇa is the black crocodile called
‘Jaladhi’, born from the ear-wax of Rudra, and having
divine power of movement. The conveyance of Vaiśra-
vaṇa (the god of wealth) is a ferocious man with eyes
like two cart-wheels and body as big as mountain, who
was born from the leg of Ambikā. The eleven Rudras
have speedy horses, terrible serpents and white oxen
of high speed. Candra has a chariot as his vehicle yoked
with five hundred swans. The vehicles of the Ādityas
are chariots yoked with horses and camels. The convey-
ances of the Vasus are elephants, men for Yakṣas, ser-
pents for Kinnaras, and horses for the Aśvinīdevas. The
Maruts of fearful appearance have deer as conveyance.
The Vidyādharas have parrots for conveyances. An
asura called Andhaka has a chariot with thousand posts
as his vehicle. Prahlāda had, as conveyance a divine
chariot of gold and silver yoked with eight white hor-
ses and elephant for Virocana, horse for Kujaṃbha,
divine chariot yoked with yellow horses, for Śaṅkukarṇa,
elephant for Hayagrīva, chariot for Maya, Great serpent
for Dundubhi, Aeroplane for Śaṃbara and lion for
Ayaśśaṅku.
