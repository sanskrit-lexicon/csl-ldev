CAÑCALĀKṢĪ¦. A notorious harlot who lived in dvā-
<div n="lb"/>para yuga. When one day at midnight she came to the
<div n="lb"/>appointed place to meet a paramour the latter had not
<div n="lb"/>arrived. While waiting impatiently there she was
<div n="lb"/>attacked and killed by a leopard. Emissaries of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>as also of Yama arrived to carry away the soul of
<div n="lb"/>Cañcalākṣī. Yama's men argued that she had sinned
<div n="lb"/>throughout her life, and therefore claimed the harlot's
<div n="lb"/>soul. But the emissaries of Visṇu countered the argu-
<div n="lb"/>ment thus: “once on her way to conduct her trade
<div n="lb"/>Cañcalākṣī got into a temple and munched tāmbūla in
<div n="lb"/>the course of which she rubbed some lime on the walls
<div n="lb"/>of the temple. Taking into consideration this fact of
<div n="lb"/>her having spent sometime thus to clean the temple
<div n="lb"/>wall her soul deserves to be led to Viṣṇuloka”.
<div n="NI"/>In the argument the emissaries of Yama were defeated
<div n="lb"/>and the soul of Cañcalākṣī was taken to Vaikuṇṭha by
<div n="lb"/>the emissaries of Viṣṇu. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
