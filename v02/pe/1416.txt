CAÑCALĀKṢĪ¦. A notorious harlot who lived in dvā-
para yuga. When one day at midnight she came to the
appointed place to meet a paramour the latter had not
arrived. While waiting impatiently there she was
attacked and killed by a leopard. Emissaries of Viṣṇu
as also of Yama arrived to carry away the soul of
Cañcalākṣī. Yama's men argued that she had sinned
throughout her life, and therefore claimed the harlot's
soul. But the emissaries of Visṇu countered the argu-
ment thus: “once on her way to conduct her trade
Cañcalākṣī got into a temple and munched tāmbūla in
the course of which she rubbed some lime on the walls
of the temple. Taking into consideration this fact of
her having spent sometime thus to clean the temple
wall her soul deserves to be led to Viṣṇuloka”.
<div n="NI"/>In the argument the emissaries of Yama were defeated
and the soul of Cañcalākṣī was taken to Vaikuṇṭha by
the emissaries of Viṣṇu. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
