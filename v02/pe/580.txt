AŚVASENA¦. A serpent which lived in the forest of
Khāṇḍava. This was the son of Takṣaka and he tried
his best to escape from the fire that burnt the forest.
(Śloka 5, Chapter 239, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Once when Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa were sitting on the banks
of the river Yamunā, Agni approached them and request-
ed them to help him burn the forest of Khāṇḍava (see
under Khāṇḍavadāha). They agreed to help him and
Agni started burning the forest. Indra poured rains over
the fire; Arjuna created a canopy of arrows and prevent-
ed the rains from falling down. Aśvasena, son of
Takṣaka tried to escape from the fire but Arjuna obs-
tructed his way by arrows. Then Aśvasena's mother
swallowed him and kept him in her stomach. Arjuna
cut off her head. Seeing this Indra sent a cyclone to
smash the canopy of arrows and Arjuna fell fainting.
Taking the opportunity Aśvasena escaped. When Arjuna
woke up from his unconscious state he found Aśvasena
missing. Then Arjuna cursed him thus: “Let not you
get refuge anywhere.” (Chapter 226, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
Aśvasena kept his grudge against Arjuna till the end.
In the great battle Arjuna and Karṇa met for a fight
and when Karṇa sent his Nāgāstra (serpent missile)
against Arjuna, Aśvasena hid himself in that missile
and burnt the beautiful headwear of Arjuna. But Karṇa
did not like this foul play and refused to accept him
when he came back. Enraged at this the serpent attacked
Arjuna directly and was killed. Before his death he got
acquainted with Kṛṣṇa. (Chapter 96, Karṇa Parva,
M.B.).
