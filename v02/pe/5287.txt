PRAKṚTI¦; PURUṢA. Prakṛti (matter) and Puruṣa
<div n="lb"/>(spirit) are two basic factors essential for production of
<div n="lb"/>the Prapañca (the visible world which is the scene of
<div n="lb"/>manifold action) as man and woman are for the product-
<div n="lb"/>ion of progeny. From Puruṣa (male), Prakṛti (female)
<div n="lb"/>originated and then they together created the Prapañca.
<div n="lb"/>The Vedas and Purāṇas make statements everywhere
<div n="lb"/>regarding Prakṛti and Puruṣa and three of the most
<div n="lb"/>important ones are given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) ‘Pra’ means ‘principal’ and ‘Kṛti’ means ‘creation’.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore the word is meant to convey the meaning
<div n="lb"/>‘one that is the principal factor for creation’, ‘Pra’ means
[Page599-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>‘sāttvic’, ‘Kṛ’ means ‘rājasic’ and ‘ta’ means ‘tāmasic’
<div n="lb"/>and the word ‘Prakṛti’ thus conveys the power of the
<div n="lb"/>three guṇas’. ‘Pra’ means ‘before’ and ‘Kṛti’ means
<div n="lb"/>creation and so Prakṛti means that which existed be-
<div n="lb"/>fore creation.
<div n="NI"/>Before creation Prakṛti lay merged with the Supreme
<div n="lb"/>Spirit without separate existence. But when the desire
<div n="lb"/>for creation was aroused, this Supreme Spirit divided
<div n="lb"/>itself into Prakṛti and Puruṣa. Then the right half
<div n="lb"/>becomes ‘Puruṣa’ and the left half ‘Prakṛti’ Even though
<div n="lb"/>they are thus two yogīndras (kings among sages)
<div n="lb"/>they see themselves as merged with the eternal One like
<div n="lb"/>fire and heat and assert the truth Sarvaṃ Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>mayam (everything is Brahman, the Supreme Spirit).
<div n="lb"/>It was this basic Prakṛti that took forms as the five
<div n="lb"/>goddesses, Durgā, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī, Sāvitrī and
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā. (9th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) Puruṣa is the vital sentient Truth that sets in action
<div n="lb"/>the entire Prapañca. This Puruṣa is Supreme among
<div n="lb"/>the Supreme, beyond human comprehension, without
<div n="lb"/>form, colour, name, without origin, growth, change or
<div n="lb"/>end, residing in himself and that which can only be
<div n="lb"/>imagined to exist. This puruṣa has got two different
<div n="lb"/>forms, the visible and the invisible and also a third
<div n="lb"/>imaginary one, time. The sages call Puruṣa the Sūkṣma-
<div n="lb"/>prakṛti (The subtle all-pervading spirit, the supreme
<div n="lb"/>soul). This Sūkṣmaprakṛti which cannot be measured
<div n="lb"/>by any unit of measure, is not attached to anything, is
<div n="lb"/>imperishable, is without decrepitude, is immovable and
<div n="lb"/>is without the senses of sound, touch smell or form.
<div n="lb"/>This Prakṛti endowed with the three guṇas, without
<div n="lb"/>beginning or end is eternal, is the root cause of this
<div n="lb"/>Prapañca. This Prakṛti pervaded over Prapañca from
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of the great Deluge to the beginning of
<div n="lb"/>creation. Brahmajñānins who were great seers and who
<div n="lb"/>knew the truth of the Vedas speak about Prakṛti thus:
<div n="lb"/>“There was no night or day then, neither the earth
<div n="lb"/>nor the sky, neither light nor darkness. There was no-
<div n="lb"/>thing but this. There was only one Brahman merged in
<div n="lb"/>which were Prakṛti and Purusa, a brahman which
<div n="lb"/>could not be understood by any of the five senses nor by
<div n="lb"/>intelligence. It was from the supreme being of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>that the two forms Prakṛti and Puruṣa originated.
<div n="lb"/>These two were separated from Viṣṇu at the time of
<div n="lb"/>the great deluge and again joined together at the
<div n="lb"/>time of creation. The form of Viṣṇu from which these
<div n="lb"/>occurred was termed Time. During the last great deluge
<div n="lb"/>this visible Prapañca merged with it and so, this deluge
<div n="lb"/>was called Prākṛtapralaya. Time is eternal, having no
<div n="lb"/>end and so the process of Sṛṣṭi, Sthiti and Saṃhāra
<div n="lb"/>(creation, existence and destruction) continued without
<div n="lb"/>any interruption.
<div n="NI"/>After that, during Pralaya (deluge), Prakṛti and Puruṣa
<div n="lb"/>stand apart due to equality of the guṇas, Sattva, Rajas
<div n="lb"/>and Tamas in Prakṛti. Viṣṇu in the form of Time starts
<div n="lb"/>the work to join them both together. Then when the
<div n="lb"/>time of creation came Viṣṇu, the Supreme Being, the
<div n="lb"/>supreme soul, the god of all living beings, omnipresent
<div n="lb"/>and omnipotent by his will entered the emotionless
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣa and emotional Prakṛti and created sensations in
<div n="lb"/>them. Smell is the sense which creates sensation in one
<div n="lb"/>by its nearness to it. Just like that Viṣṇu by his very
<div n="lb"/>presence near them created disturbances in them. It is
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, the best of Puruṣas, who acts as Prakṛti which
<div n="lb"/>can disturb and which can be disturbed, which exists
[Page600-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in states of contraction and expansion. It is Viṣṇu, the
<div n="lb"/>god of the gods, who exists in forms of Sūkṣma and
<div n="lb"/>Sthūla, and as the great tattva and as the devas like
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>The Mahattattva originated from Prakṛti, which was
<div n="lb"/>existing as emotionless due to the equalisation of the
<div n="lb"/>three guṇas, when at the time of creation Viṣṇu, Truth
<div n="lb"/>in the form of Kṣetrajña (knower), merged with Pra-
<div n="lb"/>kṛti. The Mahattattva in its three forms, Sattva, Rajas
<div n="lb"/>and Tamas lay enveloped by Prakṛti just as a seed
<div n="lb"/>is covered by its husk. From this Mahattattva originat-
<div n="lb"/>ed the three egos, Vaikārika, Taijasa and Tāmasa, the
<div n="lb"/>cause of the Pañcabhūtas. Because that ego contained
<div n="lb"/>the three guṇas it became the cause of the origin of the
<div n="lb"/>bhūtas (elements) and indriyas (senses). Ego pervaded
<div n="lb"/>the Mahattattva just as the Mahattattva pervaded
<div n="lb"/>(Aṃśa 1, Chapter 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) In the beginning during the Deluge the world was
<div n="lb"/>all water. Then Śiva tore open his thigh and dropped
<div n="lb"/>a drop of blood in the waters. It became a huge egg. He
<div n="lb"/>broke it and from it came out Puruṣa and from Puruṣa
<div n="lb"/>he made Prakṛti for the creation of the Prapañca. These
<div n="lb"/>two, Prakṛti and Puruṣa, created the Prajāpatis and
<div n="lb"/>they in turn created the prajās. Puruṣa seeing the vast
<div n="lb"/>creation going on due to him became arrogant and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva chopped off his head. Śiva became repentant of his
<div n="lb"/>hasty deed later. To atone for his sin he took the skull
<div n="lb"/>in his hand and vowed that he would ever carry a skull in
<div n="lb"/>his hand and that he would live in cremation grounds.
<div n="lb"/>The two halves of the great egg became ākāśa and
<div n="lb"/>bhūmi (earth and sky). (Taraṅga 2, Kathāpīṭhalambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara).
