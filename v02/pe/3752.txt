KUBERA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Pulastya—Viśravas—Kubera.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Pulastya Prajāpati wedded Māninī alias Havir-
<div n="lb"/>bhū, daughter of sage Tṛṇabindu, and a son called
<div n="lb"/>Viśravas was born to them, Viśravas married Ilibilā
<div n="lb"/>alias Daivavarṇinī, daughter of Bharadvāja. Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa were the sons of Viśravas
<div n="lb"/>by another wife. (Refer to the genealogy of Rāvaṇa).
<div n="lb"/>Viśravas was childless for long, and the above mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed four sons were the fruits of the boon granted him
<div n="lb"/>by Brahmā, whom he pleased by austerities. (For details
<div n="lb"/>see under Viśravas, Para 1).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kubera's attainment of eminence.%} Once during Kṛta-
<div n="lb"/>yuga the Devas went to Varuṇa, and after performing
<div n="lb"/>a Yajña for Kubera they told him thus: “In future you
<div n="lb"/>live in the ocean itself as deva of all rivers, and let the
<div n="lb"/>ocean and the rivers obey you. As in the case of the
<div n="lb"/>moon you too will experience waxing and waning.”
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards Kubera became the lord of
[Page435-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>oceans, rivers, streams etc. and all of them together
<div n="lb"/>gave him immense wealth. Śiva became a particular
<div n="lb"/>friend of Kubera. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 47).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kubera in Laṅkā.%} Afterwards Kubera performed
<div n="lb"/>penance for ten thousand years in water with head
<div n="lb"/>submerged, to please Brahmā. Yet, Brahmā did not
<div n="lb"/>appear. Then he performed penance standing on one
<div n="lb"/>foot in the centre of Pañcāgni. Brahmā appeared and
<div n="lb"/>asked him to choose any boon. Kubera requested that
<div n="lb"/>he might be made a lokapālaka (protector of the uni-
<div n="lb"/>verse) and the custodian of wealth, and Brahmā respon-
<div n="lb"/>ded by supplying Kubera the treasures Śaṅkha nidhi
<div n="lb"/>and Padmanidhi and also the Puṣpaka Vimāna as
<div n="lb"/>vehicle. He was also appointed one of the Aṣṭadikpāla-
<div n="lb"/>kas. (Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirṛti, Varuṇa, Vāyu,
<div n="lb"/>Kubera and Īśa are the eight protectors of the eight
<div n="lb"/>regions). Kubera's city is called Mahodaya.
<div n="NI"/>Kubera felt really happy and told his father Viśravas
<div n="lb"/>about his new status and dignity. The father also
<div n="lb"/>blessed the son. Kubera requested his father to get a
<div n="lb"/>city built for him to live in, and his father asked him to
<div n="lb"/>settle down in Laṅkā built by Maya on top of the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Trikūṭa in the middle of the south sea. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards Kubera took his abode in Laṅkā. (It
<div n="lb"/>was originally built for Indra).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Old history of Laṅkā.%} Once upon a time when
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā was repeating the Vedas he felt hungry. He was
<div n="lb"/>annoyed that at that untimely hour he should have felt
<div n="lb"/>hungry, and from his angry face emerged the Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>called Heti. From his hunger emerged the Yakṣa called
<div n="lb"/>Praheti. The Rākṣasa turned out to be an unrighteous
<div n="lb"/>being, and the Yakṣa a righteous person. Heti married
<div n="lb"/>Bhayā, daughter of Kāla, and a son Vidyutkeśa was born
<div n="lb"/>to them, who wedded Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of Sandhyā.
<div n="lb"/>To them were born a child, whom they forsook in
<div n="lb"/>the valley of mountain Manthara and went their own.
<div n="lb"/>way. Śiva and Pārvatī came that way just then, saw
<div n="lb"/>the forsaken child and blessed it. At once the child
<div n="lb"/>became a youth. Śiva named him Sukeśa, and he
<div n="lb"/>married Devavatī, the daughter of a Gandharva called
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimaya. To them were born three sons called
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān, Sumālī. and Mālī. Thanks to the blessings
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva all of them became youths as soon as they were
<div n="lb"/>born. By means of penances they secured from Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>the boon to conquer the three worlds.
<div n="NI"/>They then returned to their father. They did not relish
<div n="lb"/>the advice of their father to lead a righteous life. They
<div n="lb"/>went round the three worlds harassing people. Maya
<div n="lb"/>built for them the city called Laṅkā on the top of the
<div n="lb"/>Mountain Trikūṭa.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the origin of Trikūṭa. Once a
<div n="lb"/>controversy arose between Vāsuki and Vāyubhagavān
<div n="lb"/>as to who was the greater of the two. To prove that he
<div n="lb"/>was greater than Vāyu, Vāsuki enveloped with his body
<div n="lb"/>mountain Mahāmeru so that Vāyu (wind) could not
<div n="lb"/>enter it, and Vāyu tried to blow off the mountain with
<div n="lb"/>the result that a dust storm concealed the whole world
<div n="lb"/>from view. The Devas took refuge in Viṣṇu, who paci-
<div n="lb"/>fied Vāsuki, and he then unwound one coil round the
<div n="lb"/>mountain. Vāyu took advantage of the opportunity and
<div n="lb"/>swept off one peak of the mountain to the South into
<div n="lb"/>the sea, and that peak is Trikūṭa.
<div n="NI"/>Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī settled down in Laṅkā, and
<div n="lb"/>they married Sundarī, Ketumatī and Vasudhā, the three
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Narmadā, a Gandharva woman. Seven
[Page435-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sons called Vajramuṣṭi, Virūpākṣa, Durmukha, Supta-
<div n="lb"/>ghna Yajñakośa, Matta and Unmatta and a daughter
<div n="lb"/>called Nalā were born to Mālyavān and Sundarī. Ten
<div n="lb"/>sons called Prahasta, Akampa, Vikaṭa, Kālakāmukha,
<div n="lb"/>Dhūmrākṣa, Daṇḍa, Supārśva, Saṃhrāda, Prakvāta
<div n="lb"/>and Bhāsakarṇa and four daughters called Vekā, Puṣ-
<div n="lb"/>potkaṭā, Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī were born to Sumālī
<div n="lb"/>and Ketumatī. Four sons called Anala, Anila, Aha and
<div n="lb"/>Sampāti (these four were the ministers of Vibhīṣaṇa)
<div n="lb"/>were born to Mālī and Vasudhā.
<div n="NI"/>When the harassments of the Rākṣasas became unbear-
<div n="lb"/>able the Devas sought protection from Śiva, and Indra
<div n="lb"/>detailed to him about the unrighteous actions of Mālya-
<div n="lb"/>vān, Sumālī and Mālī. Śiva directed the Devas to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, who set out, to fight against the Rākṣasas.
<div n="lb"/>Mālī cut at Garuḍa, and Viṣṇu killed him (Mālī)
<div n="lb"/>with his Sudarśana Cakra. The other Rākṣasas retreated
<div n="lb"/>to Laṅkā. As their presence in Laṅkā was dan-
<div n="lb"/>gerous to the Devas, Viṣṇu directed the Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>Cakra to go to Laṅkā every day and kill the Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>in groups. The Cakra began its work, and the remaining
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas escaped to Pātāla. Laṅkā became thus deserted
<div n="lb"/>and Kubera took his abode there. The Yakṣas, born from
<div n="lb"/>the hunger of Brahmā roamed about without a leader
<div n="lb"/>and ultimately settled down in Laṅkā under the leader-
<div n="lb"/>ship of Kubera. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kubera left Laṅkā.%} The other sons of Viśravas like
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa returned with boons from Brahmā for the con-
<div n="lb"/>quest of the earth, and the first thing Rāvaṇa did was to
<div n="lb"/>drive away his brother Kubera from Laṅkā. He also
<div n="lb"/>took by force the Puṣpaka Vimāna of Kubera, who
<div n="lb"/>cursed Rāvaṇa thus: “This will never be your vehicle,
<div n="lb"/>but will become that of his, who kills you.”
<div n="NI"/>Kubera, with the Yakṣas, Kinnaras etc. went north and
<div n="lb"/>settled on mount Gandhamādana. (Vana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 275).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kubera's sabhā.%} The assembly hall of Kubera is 100
<div n="lb"/>yojanas in length and 100 yojanas wide. High walls
<div n="lb"/>surround the city. In the centre of the city is a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>mansion studded with gems where Kubera sits surrounded
<div n="lb"/>by thousands of women. Māruta Deva carrying fragrance
<div n="lb"/>from Kalpavṛkṣa worships him. Gandharva and Apsarā
<div n="lb"/>women entertain Kubera with music. Miśrakeśī, Ram-
<div n="lb"/>bhā, Menakā, Urvaśī, Citrasenā, Śucismitā, Ghṛtācī,
<div n="lb"/>Puñjikasthalā, Viśvācī, Sahajanyā, Pramlocā, Vargā,
<div n="lb"/>Saurabheyī, Samīcī, Budbudā, and Latā are the chief
<div n="lb"/>among them. Maṇibhadra (Māṇibhadra), Dhanada,
<div n="lb"/>Āśveta, Bhadra, Guhyaka, Kaśeraka, Gaṇḍakaṇḍu,
<div n="lb"/>Pradyota, Mahābala, Ka, Tumburu, Piśāca, Gajakarṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Viśāla, Varāhakarṇa, Tāmroṣṭha, Halakakṣa, Halodaka
<div n="lb"/>Haṃsacūḍa, Śaṅkhāvarta, Hemanetra, Vibhīṣaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpānana, Piṅgalaka, Śoṇitoda, Pravālaka, Vṛkṣabāṣ-
<div n="lb"/>paniketa, Cīravāsas and Nalakūbara are the chief
<div n="lb"/>members in the court of Kubera. Śiva, a good friend
<div n="lb"/>of Kubera, very often visits him. Gandharvas and sages
<div n="lb"/>like Viśvāvasu, Hāhā, Hūhū, Parvata, Tumburu and
<div n="lb"/>Śailūṣa live in Kubera's assembly. Nārada told Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra that the Kuberasabhā was thus always sweet and
<div n="lb"/>pleasant. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Fight between Kubera and Rāvaṇa.%} Kubera got secret
<div n="lb"/>information that the Devas and the brahmins had decid-
<div n="lb"/>ed jointly to complain to Mahāviṣṇu about their
<div n="lb"/>unbearable harassment by Rāvaṇa. He sent a messen-
<div n="lb"/>ger to his brother Rāvaṇa warning him to lead a more
<div n="lb"/>righteous life. Rāvaṇa got so much enraged at the
[Page436-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>advice of his brother that he cut the messenger into
<div n="lb"/>pieces and served as food to the Rākṣasas.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa mobilised his army against Kubera and the
<div n="lb"/>Devas, and decided first to attack Kubera. At the head
<div n="lb"/>of a huge army led by heroes like Mahodara, Prahasta,
<div n="lb"/>Mārīca, Śuka, Sāraṇa, Vajradaṃṣṭra, Dhūmrākṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Virūpākṣa, Yūpākṣa, Mahāpārśva, Matta, Unmatta,
<div n="lb"/>Vikaṭa, Suptaghna, Yajñāntaka, Makarākṣa, Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa, Atikāya and Akṣakumāra, Rāvaṇa marched to
<div n="lb"/>Alakāpurī where a fierce battle ensued between Rāva-
<div n="lb"/>ṇa's and Kubera's armies. Many Yakṣas were killed
<div n="lb"/>by Rāvaṇa's army, and the Yakṣa hero Maṇicara
<div n="lb"/>killed a large number of Rākṣasas. As a last resort
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa thrashed Maṇicara on the head with a club
<div n="lb"/>and this turned the hair on his head to one side. From
<div n="lb"/>that day Maṇicara came to be known as Pārśvamauli
<div n="lb"/>(head turned to one side). In the fight that followed
<div n="lb"/>between Kubera and Rāvaṇa the former fell down
<div n="lb"/>unconscious. But, the Yakṣas brought two Vimānas
<div n="lb"/>and carried Kubera to the palace. Rāvaṇa plundered
<div n="lb"/>Kubera's palace and carried off to Laṅkā a lot of costly
<div n="lb"/>gems and other wealth. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa)
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Kubera became a Chameleon.%} King Marutta once per-
<div n="lb"/>formed a Maheśvara yajña to which were invited
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Varuṇa, Kubera and Kāla. While the yajña was
<div n="lb"/>progressing Rāvaṇa came that way with his army.
<div n="lb"/>Indra and the others, in great fear, ran away and
<div n="lb"/>escaped disguised in various forms, Kubera assuming
<div n="lb"/>the form of a chameleon. After resuming his own form
<div n="lb"/>Kubera gave the Chameleon the gift to change its
<div n="lb"/>colour. It was further blessed that to the onlookers it
<div n="lb"/>would seem that there was gold on its cheeks. (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Kubera cursed Virūpākṣa.%} Kubera had a yakṣa called
<div n="lb"/>Virūpākṣa as Manager, and he was in charge of
<div n="lb"/>Kubera's treasures also. Virūpākṣa had employed a
<div n="lb"/>gigantic yakṣa to look after the treasures outside the
<div n="lb"/>capital. One day a brahmin called Pāśupata came in
<div n="lb"/>search of treasures to Alakāpurī. He knew a very
<div n="lb"/>peculiar art, viz. he would go about with a lamp
<div n="lb"/>lighted with ‘the ghee of men’ (oily substance extracted
<div n="lb"/>from human body) and the lamp would tumble down
<div n="lb"/>from his hands on earth exactly on spots where trea-
<div n="lb"/>sures lay hidden. Pāśupata tried to unearth Kubera's
<div n="lb"/>treasures by the above means, and Virūpākṣa who got
<div n="lb"/>scent of the brahmin's activities got him killed. Since a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin (Pāśupata) was killed the sin of brahmahatyā
<div n="lb"/>affected the Yakṣa community, and angered at this
<div n="lb"/>Kubera cursed Virūpākṣa into a man, and he was born
<div n="lb"/>on earth as the son of a brahmin. Virūpākṣa's wife
<div n="lb"/>complained about this curse to Kubera, who told her
<div n="lb"/>that she would be born as a daughter of the maid-
<div n="lb"/>servant of the brahmin as whose son her husband was
<div n="lb"/>born, and that he (son) would marry her. Kubera,
<div n="lb"/>further told her that association with her would redeem
<div n="lb"/>Virūpākṣa from the curse and that both of them would
<div n="lb"/>return to him. Accordingly she lay as a human child at
<div n="lb"/>the gates of a brahmin maid-servant, who took it to her
<div n="lb"/>master. The child and the brahmin's son grew up
<div n="lb"/>together in his father's house, and in due course they
<div n="lb"/>were wedded to each other. They felt so happy as
<div n="lb"/>though at a reunion after a long separation. First the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin boy and after him his wife expired, and they
<div n="lb"/>returned to Alakāpurī. (Kathāsaritsāgara)
[Page436-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Kubera and emperor Pṛthu.%} While emperor Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>was ruling the land in the best interests of his subjects,
<div n="lb"/>mountains, trees, Devas, Asuras, Saptarṣis, Rākṣasas etc.
<div n="lb"/>came to the earth and sang his praises, and as ordered by
<div n="lb"/>the emperor the earth turned itself into a cow and they
<div n="lb"/>milked her. It was Kubera who served as calf when
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasas began to milk the cow. (Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 69, Verse 24).
<div n="NI"/>The Devas crowned Pṛthu as emperor, and, on that
<div n="lb"/>occasion imperial symbols were presented to him. The
<div n="lb"/>throne was presented by Kubera; the royal umbrella by
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa; the crown by Indra and the sceptre by Yama.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha Chapter 15, Verses 14 and 15).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Kubera cursed Tumburu.%} The Yakṣa called Tumburu
<div n="lb"/>once displeased Kubera, who cursed him into a Rākṣasa.
<div n="lb"/>He was to be redeemed from the curse on his death at
<div n="lb"/>the hands of Śrī Rāma. Tumburu, who was born as
<div n="lb"/>Virādha, the Rākṣasa in Daṇḍakāraṇya attacked Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa during their stay in exile in the forest
<div n="lb"/>and was killed by them. He was cremated in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>He resumed his former form as Tumburu and returned
<div n="lb"/>to Kubera's palace. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Canto 4).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Kubera became Piṅgalākṣa.%} Kubera once looked with
<div n="lb"/>jealousy at Pārvatī seated on the left thigh of Śiva, and
<div n="lb"/>therefore, he became blind in one eye. When Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>regained her equanimity she turned that eye of Kubera
<div n="lb"/>into yellow in colour so that he might always remember
<div n="lb"/>the incident. Henceforth Kubera came to be known as
<div n="lb"/>Ekapiṅgala.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Agastya cursed Kubera.%} Kubera also was invited to
<div n="lb"/>the chanting of mantras held by the Devas at Kuśāvatī.
<div n="lb"/>Kubera was on his way to Kuśāvatī with Maṇimān
<div n="lb"/>when the latter spat on the head of Agastya, who was
<div n="lb"/>performing penance on the banks of river Kālindī.
<div n="lb"/>Agastya cursed them thus:—“Oh Kubera, your attend-
<div n="lb"/>ant Maṇimān has insulted me. Therefore, he himself and
<div n="lb"/>the army will be killed by a man. You will grieve over
<div n="lb"/>their death. But, you will be absolved from this curse at
<div n="lb"/>the sight of the man, who had killed Maṇimān and his
<div n="lb"/>army.”
<div n="NI"/>Bhīmasena, who went to mount Gandhamādana in
<div n="lb"/>search of the Saugandhika flower could kill Maṇimān
<div n="lb"/>and his soldiers because of this curse of Agastya. After
<div n="lb"/>killing Maṇimān, Bhīma saw Kubera in person, and
<div n="lb"/>the latter got absolved from the curse. (Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 161).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Other information about Kubera.%} (i) He comforted
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas once during their life in exile in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 161, Verse 41).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) During the war with Rāvaṇa when Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>fainted on the field, it was the water, purified by
<div n="lb"/>mantras, which Kubera sent through the Yakṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Guhyaka, which brought Rāma back to consciousness.
<div n="NI"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 289, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Kubera once cursed the Yakṣa called Sthūṇakarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>He went to live in forest Ambā the woman became a
<div n="lb"/>male by getting the penis of Sthūṇakarṇa. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Ambā and Sthūṇakarṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Śukrācārya once gave Kubera a lot of wealth.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 23).
<div n="NI"/>(v) A King called Mucukunda once fought with
<div n="lb"/>Kubera. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 74, Verse 4). See under
<div n="lb"/>Mucukunda.
[Page437-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Śukra once carried off all the wealth of Kubera,
<div n="lb"/>who complained to Śiva about it. Śiva, in anger, raised
<div n="lb"/>his śūla, when Śukra stood on its top and pressed it
<div n="lb"/>down. Śiva threw Śukra off but he fell into the palms
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva who threw him again. Śukra then entered the
<div n="lb"/>stomach of Śiva and roamed about there finding no
<div n="lb"/>path to get out. Śiva waited with the śula to kill Śukra
<div n="lb"/>the moment he came out of his (Śiva's) stomach. Śukra
<div n="lb"/>came out as Śiva's son, and Pārvatī prevented Śiva from
<div n="lb"/>killing Śukra on the plea that it was not proper to kill
<div n="lb"/>one's own son. Śukra thus escaped and Kubera lost
<div n="lb"/>some of his wealth. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 289).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) On another occasion Kubera entertained sage
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭāvakra. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 37).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Kubera should be installed in temples as seated
<div n="lb"/>on a goat with club in his hand. (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 51).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) The name of Kubera's wife was Bhadrā. (Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 198, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(x) Kubera is called Naravāhana also as he rides in a
<div n="lb"/>vehicle drawn by men. He is also called Rājarāja,
<div n="lb"/>as he is King of Kings. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 275, Verses
<div n="lb"/>1-3).
<div n="NI"/>(xi) Viśravas got angry with Kubera, and from that
<div n="lb"/>day he deputed three Rākṣasa girls to serve his father.
<div n="lb"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 275, Verses 1-3).
