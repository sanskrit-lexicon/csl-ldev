NANDAKA II¦. A sword of Mahāviṣṇu. (M.B. Anuśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana Parva, Chapter 147, Stanza 15).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story explaining how Mahāviṣṇu came by
<div n="lb"/>this sword Nandaka. In days of old Brahmā performed
<div n="lb"/>a sacrifice on the banks of the heavenly Gaṅgā on a
<div n="lb"/>peak of mount Mahāmeru. While Brahmā was sitting
<div n="lb"/>in deep meditation in the sacrifice Lohāsura was seen
<div n="lb"/>coming to cause disturbance to the sacrifice. Immediate-
<div n="lb"/>ly a male being came into existence from the medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation of Brahmā. The male being paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and the devas (gods) became glad and they
<div n="lb"/>encouraged the male being. Because the gods greeted the
<div n="lb"/>male one, he was changed to a sword called Nandaka
<div n="lb"/>(that which is greeted or thanked for). That sword
<div n="lb"/>was received by Mahāviṣṇu at the request of the gods.
<div n="lb"/>When Mahāviṣṇu slowly took it Lohāsura came near.
<div n="lb"/>He was an asura of blue complexion, with thousand
<div n="lb"/>hands of adamantine fists. By wielding his club he
<div n="lb"/>drove away the gods. Mahāviṣṇu cut down his limbs
<div n="lb"/>one by one and those organs became metals by the
<div n="lb"/>touch of the sword. Then Mahāviṣṇu killed the asura.
<div n="lb"/>Then Mahāviṣṇu granted Nandaka a pure body and
<div n="lb"/>various boons. Afterwards Nandaka became the deity
<div n="lb"/>of weapons on the earth. Thus Brahmā, who got rid
<div n="lb"/>of the disturbance by the aid of Viṣṇu, completed the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 245).
