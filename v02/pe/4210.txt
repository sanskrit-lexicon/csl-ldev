MAHODAYA¦. One of the sons of Vasiṣṭha. Once
Triśaṅku, King of Ayodhyā, conducted a yāga with
Viśvāmitra as Ṛtvik and for that yāga Viśvāmitra
invited Vasiṣṭha and his son Mahodaya also. But
Mahodaya refused to respond to the invitation and
sent a message picturing both Viśvāmitra and
Triśaṅku as Caṇḍālas. Enraged at this insulting
message Viśvāmitra cursed Mahodaya to become
Śūdra. (Verses 20-21, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Chapter 59, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa).
