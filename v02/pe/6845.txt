ŚUBHADATTA¦. A wood-cutter who lived in Pāṭalī-
putra.
<div n="NI"/>Śubhadatta earned his living by cutting wood in the
forest and selling it for fuel. One day, while cutting
wood in the forest he saw four Yakṣas by chance. When
he understood from their dress and bearing that they
were divine beings, Śubhadatta was frightened. The
Yakṣas spoke to him and when they came to know that
he was poor, they engaged him as their servant. Śubha-
datta served them with devotion. When it was time
for their meal they pointed to him a pot and asked him
to serve them food from it. But when Śubhadatta saw
the pot empty, he was confused. The Yakṣas, with an
amused smile asked him to put his hand into the pot
and assured him that he would get anything he wished
to get from it.
<div n="NI"/>Śubhadatta accordingly took out all the things they
wanted from it and served them. They took their food
and were satisfied. A few days passed in this way and
then Śubhadatta began to think of his family. The
Yakṣas understood that he was longing to return home.
So they allowed him to go after getting whatever boon
he wished to ask them. Śubhadatta asked for that
magic pot which would supply whatever he wanted.
On hearing it the Yakṣas told him that he would not
be able to keep that pot and that if it was broken
everything would be lost. So they advised him to ask
them something else. But Śubhadatta was not prepared
to accept their advice. At last they gave him the magic
pot.
<div n="NI"/>Śubhadatta reached home happily with the pot. He
told the whole story to his people at home. His neigh-
bours grew suspicious when he stopped going to the
forest to cut trees, after he returned with the pot. To
their enquiries about it, he replied haughtily and inform-
ed them of his good luck. One day in his frantic joy,
he danced, carrying the pot on his head and as ill-luck
would have it, he slipped his foot and fell down. The
[Page746-a+ 65]
pot crashed to the ground and was broken to pieces.
So he was forced to become the wood-cutter again.
