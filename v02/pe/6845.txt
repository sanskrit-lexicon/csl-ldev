ŚUBHADATTA¦. A wood-cutter who lived in Pāṭalī-
<div n="lb"/>putra.
<div n="NI"/>Śubhadatta earned his living by cutting wood in the
<div n="lb"/>forest and selling it for fuel. One day, while cutting
<div n="lb"/>wood in the forest he saw four Yakṣas by chance. When
<div n="lb"/>he understood from their dress and bearing that they
<div n="lb"/>were divine beings, Śubhadatta was frightened. The
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas spoke to him and when they came to know that
<div n="lb"/>he was poor, they engaged him as their servant. Śubha-
<div n="lb"/>datta served them with devotion. When it was time
<div n="lb"/>for their meal they pointed to him a pot and asked him
<div n="lb"/>to serve them food from it. But when Śubhadatta saw
<div n="lb"/>the pot empty, he was confused. The Yakṣas, with an
<div n="lb"/>amused smile asked him to put his hand into the pot
<div n="lb"/>and assured him that he would get anything he wished
<div n="lb"/>to get from it.
<div n="NI"/>Śubhadatta accordingly took out all the things they
<div n="lb"/>wanted from it and served them. They took their food
<div n="lb"/>and were satisfied. A few days passed in this way and
<div n="lb"/>then Śubhadatta began to think of his family. The
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas understood that he was longing to return home.
<div n="lb"/>So they allowed him to go after getting whatever boon
<div n="lb"/>he wished to ask them. Śubhadatta asked for that
<div n="lb"/>magic pot which would supply whatever he wanted.
<div n="lb"/>On hearing it the Yakṣas told him that he would not
<div n="lb"/>be able to keep that pot and that if it was broken
<div n="lb"/>everything would be lost. So they advised him to ask
<div n="lb"/>them something else. But Śubhadatta was not prepared
<div n="lb"/>to accept their advice. At last they gave him the magic
<div n="lb"/>pot.
<div n="NI"/>Śubhadatta reached home happily with the pot. He
<div n="lb"/>told the whole story to his people at home. His neigh-
<div n="lb"/>bours grew suspicious when he stopped going to the
<div n="lb"/>forest to cut trees, after he returned with the pot. To
<div n="lb"/>their enquiries about it, he replied haughtily and inform-
<div n="lb"/>ed them of his good luck. One day in his frantic joy,
<div n="lb"/>he danced, carrying the pot on his head and as ill-luck
<div n="lb"/>would have it, he slipped his foot and fell down. The
[Page746-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>pot crashed to the ground and was broken to pieces.
<div n="lb"/>So he was forced to become the wood-cutter again.
