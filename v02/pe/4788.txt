NAVARĀTRĪ¦. Navarātripūjā (nine nights' worship) is
<div n="lb"/>done to goddess Durgā. Though this is observed through-
<div n="lb"/>out the whole of India, it is more prominent in North
<div n="lb"/>India than anywhere else. (To know the details regard-
<div n="lb"/>ing the origin of this worship, see under Sudarśa, Śaśi-
<div n="lb"/>kalā and Vijayadaśamī).
<div n="NI"/>As ordained in the Vedas, the Nine nights' worship is
<div n="lb"/>to be made in the seasons of spring and autumn. These
<div n="lb"/>two seasons are called Kāladaṃṣtrās (the tusks of
<div n="lb"/>seasons). Diseases and deaths occur in these seasons in
<div n="lb"/>excess, and so it is ordained that this fast and worship
<div n="lb"/>should be conducted in the months of Meḍam (Meṣa)
<div n="lb"/>and Tulām.
<div n="NI"/>Vyāsa has ordered that navarātri worship should be
<div n="lb"/>conducted as follows. The things necessary for the
<div n="lb"/>worship and oblations should be collected on the new
<div n="lb"/>moon day. Only clarified butter could be eaten on
<div n="lb"/>that day. An open temple should be erected with
<div n="lb"/>pillars and flag-posts in an open flat place which is pure.
<div n="lb"/>It will be good if the shed has a circumference of sixteen
<div n="lb"/>cubits. There should be sixteen pillars. The shed should
[Page537-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>be floored with the mixture of cowdung and white clay.
<div n="lb"/>In the middle of the shed there must be a dais having
<div n="lb"/>a height of one cubit and a circumference of four cubits.
<div n="lb"/>This is the place for the seat. The shed and the dais
<div n="lb"/>should be decorated.
<div n="NI"/>The throne placed on the dais must be covered with a
<div n="lb"/>white silk and Devī (goddess) should be consecrated on
<div n="lb"/>it. A calm Brahmin should read the Vedas and at that
<div n="lb"/>time the worship of the goddess should begin. This
<div n="lb"/>worship will continue for nine days. Another ritual of
<div n="lb"/>this ‘navarātripūjā’ is the worship of virgins. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Kumārīpūjā)
