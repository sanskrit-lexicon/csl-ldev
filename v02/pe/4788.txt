NAVARĀTRĪ¦. Navarātripūjā (nine nights' worship) is
done to goddess Durgā. Though this is observed through-
out the whole of India, it is more prominent in North
India than anywhere else. (To know the details regard-
ing the origin of this worship, see under Sudarśa, Śaśi-
kalā and Vijayadaśamī).
<div n="NI"/>As ordained in the Vedas, the Nine nights' worship is
to be made in the seasons of spring and autumn. These
two seasons are called Kāladaṃṣtrās (the tusks of
seasons). Diseases and deaths occur in these seasons in
excess, and so it is ordained that this fast and worship
should be conducted in the months of Meḍam (Meṣa)
and Tulām.
<div n="NI"/>Vyāsa has ordered that navarātri worship should be
conducted as follows. The things necessary for the
worship and oblations should be collected on the new
moon day. Only clarified butter could be eaten on
that day. An open temple should be erected with
pillars and flag-posts in an open flat place which is pure.
It will be good if the shed has a circumference of sixteen
cubits. There should be sixteen pillars. The shed should
[Page537-a+ 65]
be floored with the mixture of cowdung and white clay.
In the middle of the shed there must be a dais having
a height of one cubit and a circumference of four cubits.
This is the place for the seat. The shed and the dais
should be decorated.
<div n="NI"/>The throne placed on the dais must be covered with a
white silk and Devī (goddess) should be consecrated on
it. A calm Brahmin should read the Vedas and at that
time the worship of the goddess should begin. This
worship will continue for nine days. Another ritual of
this ‘navarātripūjā’ is the worship of virgins. (See
under Kumārīpūjā)
