RAIBHYA I¦. A hermit who was famous in the Palace of
Yudhiṣṭhira. Information about this hermit, found in
the Mahābhārata is given below:
<div n="NI"/>(1) Raibhya who was a friend of Bharadvāja had two
sons named Arvāvasu and Parāvasu. They were
great scholars. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 135,
Stanza 12).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Bharadvāja once forbade his son Yavakrīta from
going to the hermitage of Raibhya. Getting angry at
this, Raibhya struck his matted hair on the ground and
created a wicked fairy and ordered her to kill Yavakrīta.
Knowing this Bharadvāja ran to that place and cursed
Raibhya that his eldest son would kill him.

killed him. By the effort of his second son Arvāvasu,
