LIKHITA II¦. An evil-natured priest of Haṃsadhvaja,
the King of Campakapurī. Śaṅkha his brother also was
the King's priest. Haṃsadhvaja blocked the sacrificial
horse of the Aśvamedha yajña of Dharmaputra and
Arjuna attacked the King to get the horse released. To
mobilise an army the King announced that each and
every soldier should assemble at the place by day-break
the next morning and added that those who disobeyed
would be put in burning oil.
<div n="NI"/>By early morning the next day all the soldiers excepting
the son of the King arrived at the palace. Sudhanvā,
the King's son, was a general of the army and his
absence annoyed the King. Haṃsadhvaja was hesitat-
ing whether his son should be punished when Likhita
advised the King to execute the punishment.
<div n="NI"/>The King put Sudhanvā into a big cauldron of boiling
oil but Sudhanvā escaped from it unscathed to the
surprise of all. Likhita and Śaṅkha said that Sudhanvā
escaped because the boiling of the oil was incomplete
and uneven. So they boiled the oil again and threw
Sudhanvā into it. At this moment a huge palm tree
split into two and fell on them and they were killed.
(Jaimini Aśvamedhaparva).
