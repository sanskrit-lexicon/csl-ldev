NIVĀTAKAVACA¦(S). A sect of Daityas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Daityas were the off-springs of Kaśyapapra-
jāpati by Diti. Two sons called Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇ-
yakaśipu and a daughter called Siṃhikā were born to
the Prajāpati of Diti. Siṃhikā was married by Vipracitti
and to them were born Rāhu and others who became
famous as the Saiṃhikeyas. Hiraṇyakaśipu had four
famous sons called Anuhlāda, Hlāda, Prahlāda (the
great devotee of Viṣṇu) and Saṃhlāda. (Some texts
refer to them as Anuhrāda, Hrāda, Prahrāda and Saṃ-
hrāda). Hlāda's son was called Hrāda, Saṃhlāda's sons
were called Āyuṣmān, Śibi and Bāṣkala, and Prahlāda's
son was called Virocana. Mahābali was Virocana's son
and Bāṇa was the eldest of the hundred sons of Mahā-
bali.
<div n="NI"/>Four crores of asuras called Nivātakavacas were born
in the family of Prahlāda. The army of the Asuras,
which routed the Devas many a time, was formed by
the Nivātakavacas and Kālakeyas. (Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 19).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Fight against Rāvaṇa.%} After securing boons from
Brahmā Nivātakavacas lived in the city of Maṇimatī and
they were a terror to the world. Rāvaṇa longed once to
defeat them and so besieged their city with his army.
The two sides fought fiercely for hundreds of years. At
last Brahmā intervened and conciliated them. From
that day onwards the Nivātakavacas became friends of
Rāvaṇa. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Annihilation.%} The Nivātakavacas in company with
the Kālakeyas attacked Devaloka. Indra, who could
not withstand the attack, sent his charioteer Mātali to
Arjuna and brought him down. Most of the Nivāta-
kavacas and Kālakeyas were killed in the fight by
Arjuna. (See under Kālakeya).
