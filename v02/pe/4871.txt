NIVĀTAKAVACA¦(S). A sect of Daityas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Daityas were the off-springs of Kaśyapapra-
<div n="lb"/>jāpati by Diti. Two sons called Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇ-
<div n="lb"/>yakaśipu and a daughter called Siṃhikā were born to
<div n="lb"/>the Prajāpati of Diti. Siṃhikā was married by Vipracitti
<div n="lb"/>and to them were born Rāhu and others who became
<div n="lb"/>famous as the Saiṃhikeyas. Hiraṇyakaśipu had four
<div n="lb"/>famous sons called Anuhlāda, Hlāda, Prahlāda (the
<div n="lb"/>great devotee of Viṣṇu) and Saṃhlāda. (Some texts
<div n="lb"/>refer to them as Anuhrāda, Hrāda, Prahrāda and Saṃ-
<div n="lb"/>hrāda). Hlāda's son was called Hrāda, Saṃhlāda's sons
<div n="lb"/>were called Āyuṣmān, Śibi and Bāṣkala, and Prahlāda's
<div n="lb"/>son was called Virocana. Mahābali was Virocana's son
<div n="lb"/>and Bāṇa was the eldest of the hundred sons of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bali.
<div n="NI"/>Four crores of asuras called Nivātakavacas were born
<div n="lb"/>in the family of Prahlāda. The army of the Asuras,
<div n="lb"/>which routed the Devas many a time, was formed by
<div n="lb"/>the Nivātakavacas and Kālakeyas. (Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 19).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Fight against Rāvaṇa.%} After securing boons from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā Nivātakavacas lived in the city of Maṇimatī and
<div n="lb"/>they were a terror to the world. Rāvaṇa longed once to
<div n="lb"/>defeat them and so besieged their city with his army.
<div n="lb"/>The two sides fought fiercely for hundreds of years. At
<div n="lb"/>last Brahmā intervened and conciliated them. From
<div n="lb"/>that day onwards the Nivātakavacas became friends of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Annihilation.%} The Nivātakavacas in company with
<div n="lb"/>the Kālakeyas attacked Devaloka. Indra, who could
<div n="lb"/>not withstand the attack, sent his charioteer Mātali to
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna and brought him down. Most of the Nivāta-
<div n="lb"/>kavacas and Kālakeyas were killed in the fight by
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. (See under Kālakeya).
