AJARA¦. Tapantaka, the minister of King Vatsa, told
him the story of a man named Ajara to illustrate the law
that all people will have to suffer the consequences of
their actions in a previous birth. The story is given be-
low:—
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time, there lived a King named Vinayaśīla
in Vilāsapura, in the city of Śrīkaṇṭhanagarī. After
some years, the King was affected by wrinkles of old age.
A physician named Taruṇacandra came to the palace to
cure the King of his wrinkles. “The King should remain
alone in the interior of the earth for full eight months.
He has to use a medicine while remaining there. It
should not even be seen by anyone else. I myself am to
administer the medicine”—This was the physician's
prescription. The King agreed. Accordingly the King

and the physician spent six months in the interior of the
earth. After that the physician, after a search, found a
man who exactly resembled the King and brought him
to the interior of the earth. After two more months,
the physician murdered the King and came out with the
new man. The people welcomed him with honour as
the King who was cured of his wrinkles. This man was
Ajara. After some time, the physician approached
Ajara for his reward. Ajara said: “It is by my Karma-
phala (consequence of my actions in my previous birth)
that I have become King. In my previous birth I re-
nounced my body after doing penance. According to the
boon which God gave me on that occasion, I have be-
come King in my present birth”. The physician returned
empty-handed. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Ratnaprabhā-
laṃbaka, 6th Taraṅga).
