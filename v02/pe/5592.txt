RĀHODARA¦ (RAHODARA). A muni of ancient days.
There is a story in Chapter 39 of the Vāmana Purāṇa
about a skull falling on the muni's neck and the place
where the skull was removed from his neck coming to
be known as Kapālamocana.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma killed the Rākṣasas who lived in Daṇḍaka
forest. The head of one of the Rākṣasas cut by a very
sharp knife was thrown off at a distance in the forest and
it fell on the neck of Rahodara, who happened to be
walking at the time in the forest. It (the head) cut
deep into the bones of the Sage and that made it
difficult for him to move about. Yet, he visited all the
holy places on the earth with the skull of the Rākṣasa
around his neck. At last he told the noble Ṛṣis about
his misfortune and they directed him to visit ‘Auśanasa-
tīrtha,’ and the moment he touched the water in the
tīrtha the skull fell into the water. Having been told
about the incident, the Ṛṣis named the tīrtha ‘Kapāla-
mocana’.
