MURA II¦. Son of Tālajaṅgha, an asura born of a part
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. The capital of this valorous Murāsura was
<div n="lb"/>in the city of Candravatī.
<div n="NI"/>Murāsura who possessed the brilliance of Brahmā was a
<div n="lb"/>nightmare to the devas. Once Murāsura fought against
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and in the fierce fight that took place Viṣṇu was
<div n="lb"/>defeated and he ran away from the battlefield and
<div n="lb"/>started sleeping in a cave named Siṃhavatī in the neigh-
<div n="lb"/>bourhood of Badarikāśrama. Mura went there too. Then
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu created a Devī through his Yogamāyā and
<div n="lb"/>made her kill Mura.
[Page512-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Pleased at the slaughter of Mura, Viṣṇu blessed her and
<div n="lb"/>said “From today onwards you will be known as ‘Ekā-
<div n="lb"/>daśī’. You will be capable of wiping off all sins on
<div n="lb"/>earth.” (Padmapurāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa 36. 50-80).
