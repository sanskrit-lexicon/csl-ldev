IRIMPU¦. A Malayalam word meaning ‘iron’. The
metal iron originated in the following way. The Devas
sought Brahmā's protection against the onslaughts of
Tārakāsura, who had obtained a boon to the effect that
he could be killed only by a son born to Śiva. And,
implored by Brahmā and others Śiva entered into the
sex act with Pārvatī. The impact shook the universe.
Agni separated them from the process and the semen of
Śiva dropped in Agni. Agni deposited it in the Gaṅgā.
The Gaṅgā could not bear it and it coursed through
her (Gaṅgā's) arteries and out of it was born Subrah-
maṇya. Also from the particles of the semen gold and
silver were produced. From the intensity of the heat
were produced iron and copper. See under Subrah-
maṇya. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Canto 37).
