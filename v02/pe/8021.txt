<div n="NI"/>1) {%The name Vāraṇāsī.%} Formerly this place was known
as Prayāga. Later it got the name Vāraṇāsī and then
Kāśī. The name Vāraṇāsī is originated from two rivers.
Bhagavān Yogaśāyī who stays in Prayāga was born from
a portion of Mahāviṣṇu. From the right leg of Yoga-
śāyī the river Varaṇā started and from his left leg the
river Asī started. These two rivers are praised and
worshipped all over the world. The temple of Yoga-
śāyī is situated in the place between these two rivers.
As the place is situated between Varaṇā and Asī it is
called Vāraṇāsi. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 3).
