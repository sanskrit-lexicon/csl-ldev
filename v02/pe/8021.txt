<div n="NI"/>1) {%The name Vāraṇāsī.%} Formerly this place was known
<div n="lb"/>as Prayāga. Later it got the name Vāraṇāsī and then
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī. The name Vāraṇāsī is originated from two rivers.
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān Yogaśāyī who stays in Prayāga was born from
<div n="lb"/>a portion of Mahāviṣṇu. From the right leg of Yoga-
<div n="lb"/>śāyī the river Varaṇā started and from his left leg the
<div n="lb"/>river Asī started. These two rivers are praised and
<div n="lb"/>worshipped all over the world. The temple of Yoga-
<div n="lb"/>śāyī is situated in the place between these two rivers.
<div n="lb"/>As the place is situated between Varaṇā and Asī it is
<div n="lb"/>called Vāraṇāsi. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 3).
