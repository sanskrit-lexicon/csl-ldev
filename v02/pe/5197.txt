PIPPALA II¦. A brahmin born of the race of Kaśyapa.
Pippala did severe penance and became arrogant of
the power acquired by it. Once he happened to see
the eminent sage Sukarmā serving with devotion his
own mother and father and that made his arrogance
fade a bit. (Bhūmi Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa, Chapter
61).
