BHADRĀYU¦. A king who was a devotee of Śiva. He
<div n="lb"/>was a leper and in his life he suffered much, even the
<div n="lb"/>pangs of death. His wife was the dutiful and good
<div n="lb"/>natured lady, Kīrtimālinī.
<div n="NI"/>On the sixteenth birthday of Bhadrāyu Śiva appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him in the name of Ṛṣabha and blessed him
<div n="lb"/>after instructing him on the precepts of Rājadharma.
<div n="lb"/>He further gave him a dagger and a conch as weapons
<div n="lb"/>and twelve thousand elephants. With the might of all
<div n="lb"/>these, Bhadrāyu became unconquerable. (Śiva Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Śatarudrasaṃhitā).
<div n="NI"/>One day, while Bhadrāyu was ruling the country, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>came in the guise of a tiger and carried away the wife
<div n="lb"/>of a brahmin. Bhadrāyu, a firm protector of his sub-
<div n="lb"/>jects gave his own wife to the brahmin and prepared
<div n="lb"/>himself to give up his life in fire. Śiva greatly pleased
<div n="lb"/>at this selfless act of Bhadrāyu befitting a true King
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and blessed him and gave back
<div n="lb"/>the brahmin his wife.
<div n="NI"/>Bhadrāyu in his previous birth was a King called
<div n="lb"/>Mandara and Kīrtimālinī in her previous birth was
<div n="lb"/>Piṅgalā, queen of Mandara. (Skanda Purāṇa, 3.3.12;
<div n="lb"/>9.14).
