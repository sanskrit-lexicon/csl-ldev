BHADRĀYU¦. A king who was a devotee of Śiva. He
was a leper and in his life he suffered much, even the
pangs of death. His wife was the dutiful and good
natured lady, Kīrtimālinī.
<div n="NI"/>On the sixteenth birthday of Bhadrāyu Śiva appeared
before him in the name of Ṛṣabha and blessed him
after instructing him on the precepts of Rājadharma.
He further gave him a dagger and a conch as weapons
and twelve thousand elephants. With the might of all
these, Bhadrāyu became unconquerable. (Śiva Purāṇa,
Śatarudrasaṃhitā).
<div n="NI"/>One day, while Bhadrāyu was ruling the country, Śiva
came in the guise of a tiger and carried away the wife
of a brahmin. Bhadrāyu, a firm protector of his sub-
jects gave his own wife to the brahmin and prepared
himself to give up his life in fire. Śiva greatly pleased
at this selfless act of Bhadrāyu befitting a true King
appeared before him and blessed him and gave back
the brahmin his wife.
<div n="NI"/>Bhadrāyu in his previous birth was a King called
Mandara and Kīrtimālinī in her previous birth was
Piṅgalā, queen of Mandara. (Skanda Purāṇa, 3.3.12;
9.14).
