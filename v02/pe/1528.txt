CHĀYĀ¦. A substitute of Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>karmā. Saṃjñā got from Sūrya three children, Manu,
<div n="lb"/>Yama and Yamī. The heat of Sūrya, her husband,
<div n="lb"/>became unbearable to her and so she created a substitute
<div n="lb"/>in her exact form and leaving her to look after Sūrya,
<div n="lb"/>her husband, she left the place and went to her father.
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya did not know of this replacement and taking her
<div n="lb"/>to be Saṃjñā he produced three children by her, Śani,
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇamanu and Tapatī. Chāyā loved her sons more
<div n="lb"/>and this made Yama angry and he raised his legs to
<div n="lb"/>strike her when Chāyā cursed that Yama's legs would fall
<div n="lb"/>off from his body. Yama complained to his father and he
<div n="lb"/>amended the curse and said that only some flesh from
<div n="lb"/>his limbs would fall to the ground and that flesh would
<div n="lb"/>serve as food to the germs in the earth. Yama would
<div n="lb"/>escape from further injury. After consoling his son he
<div n="lb"/>turned towards Chāyā. The anger of Sūrya frightened
<div n="lb"/>her and she told him everything. Sūrya then divorced
<div n="lb"/>her and brought back Saṃjñā. For details see Saṃjñā.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 9 of Harivaṃśa; Chapter 2, Aṃśa 3, Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>purāṇa).
