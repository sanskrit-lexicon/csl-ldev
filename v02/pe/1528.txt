CHĀYĀ¦. A substitute of Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśva-
karmā. Saṃjñā got from Sūrya three children, Manu,
Yama and Yamī. The heat of Sūrya, her husband,
became unbearable to her and so she created a substitute
in her exact form and leaving her to look after Sūrya,
her husband, she left the place and went to her father.
Sūrya did not know of this replacement and taking her
to be Saṃjñā he produced three children by her, Śani,
Sāvarṇamanu and Tapatī. Chāyā loved her sons more
and this made Yama angry and he raised his legs to
strike her when Chāyā cursed that Yama's legs would fall
off from his body. Yama complained to his father and he
amended the curse and said that only some flesh from
his limbs would fall to the ground and that flesh would
serve as food to the germs in the earth. Yama would
escape from further injury. After consoling his son he
turned towards Chāyā. The anger of Sūrya frightened
her and she told him everything. Sūrya then divorced
her and brought back Saṃjñā. For details see Saṃjñā.

purāṇa).
