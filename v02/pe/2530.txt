GUṆAKEŚĪ¦. Daughter of Mātali, charioteer of Indra.
<div n="lb"/>She was more beautiful and well-behaved than many
<div n="lb"/>other girls. Mātali went about in search of a suitable
<div n="lb"/>husband for her in all the three worlds. At last he
<div n="lb"/>met Nārada going to the presence of Kubera. He told
<div n="lb"/>Nārada about this and Nārada took Mātali to Pātālaloka
<div n="lb"/>to search for a suitable bridegroom. Then they found out
<div n="lb"/>a serpent boy named Sumukha (good looking) worthy
<div n="lb"/>of his name who was the grandson of Āryaka and son
<div n="lb"/>of Cikura born of the family of Airāvata. But Sumu-
<div n="lb"/>kha was in danger at that time. Garuḍa had taken a
<div n="lb"/>vow that he would eat Sumukha the next month. Āryaka
<div n="lb"/>told Nārada about this. Nārada took Sumukha to the
<div n="lb"/>court of Indra. Mahāviṣṇu was also present there. When
<div n="lb"/>Nārada told the story there Indra blessed Sumukha and
<div n="lb"/>granted him long life. This made Garuḍa angry and he
<div n="lb"/>went to the court of Indra and rebuked Indra. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu who was present there then did not like this act of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa and he called the latter to his side and asked
<div n="lb"/>him whether he could bear the weight of one of his
<div n="lb"/>arms. With arrogance Garuḍa said ‘yes’ and Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>then placed one of his arms on the shoulder of Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>But Garuḍa found the weight unbearable and begged
<div n="lb"/>pardon of Viṣṇu, bereft of all his arrogance. The
<div n="lb"/>marriage of Sumukha with Guṇakeśī was then conduct-
<div n="lb"/>ed. (Chapters 97 to 105. Udyoga Parva.)
<div n="NI"/>GUṆAMUKHYĀ. A celestial maiden who took part
<div n="lb"/>in the birthday celebrations of Arjuna. She gave a
<div n="lb"/>dance there then. (Śloka 61, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva).
