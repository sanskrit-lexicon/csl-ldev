CAṆḌAMUṆḌAS¦. Two brothers born in the Asura
dynasty, the elder brother being called Caṇḍa and
the younger Muṇḍa. These brothers collected, like
the other asura leaders Dhūmrākṣa, and Raktabīja,
thousands of soldiers and lived in all pomp and
glory.
<div n="NI"/>During this period two asura brothers called Śumbha
and Niśumbha had returned from the Himālayas after
securing from Brahman a boon that they would meet
with their death only at the hands of a woman. Caṇḍa
and Muṇḍa became their friends and attendants.
Śumbha and Niśumbha set out on a triumphal tour
and conquered heaven, earth and pātāla. The Devas
[Page170-b+ 65]
took refuge in a forest. After wandering in the forest
for a long time, at the instance of Bṛhaspati they sought
asylum with Pārvatī. Pārvatī stood for sometime in deep
concentration, and there emerged from her divine body
Kauṣikī or Kālī. Pārvatī assured the Devas that she
would kill Śumbha and Niśumbha. And, then Kālī sat
alone on a rock in the thick Forest. Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa,
who happened to pass that way were attracted by the
great beauty of Pārvatī and imparted the news to
Śumbha and Niśumbha, and they deputed Dhūmrākṣa
and 60,000 soldiers to bring Pārvatī over to them; but
by one huṃkāra (sound ‘hum’) she reduced them to
ashes. Ultimately she killed Śumbha and Niśumbha
also. (Devī Bhāgavata, Pañcama Skandha).
