PUṢKARĀKṢA I¦. A King of Purāṇic fame.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a King called Bhadrākṣa in Takṣa-
<div n="lb"/>śilānagara. He worshipped Bhagavatī with 108 lotus
<div n="lb"/>flowers daily in order to obtain a son. One day he
<div n="lb"/>found one flower missing and the brave king tore open
<div n="lb"/>his heart and made the number complete. The goddess
<div n="lb"/>was pleased and she blessed him saying that he would
[Page622-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>have a son worthy of becoming an emperor. Puṣkarākṣa
<div n="lb"/>was the son thus born.
<div n="NI"/>The boy grew up and after crowing him as King
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrākṣa left for the forests. Puṣkarākṣa worshipped
<div n="lb"/>Śiva daily to get a suitable wife. After some time Śiva
<div n="lb"/>blessed him saying that he would get a very good wife.
<div n="NI"/>One day he went for hunting. He saw a camel trying
<div n="lb"/>to eat two cobras engaged in the act of mating. Instant-
<div n="lb"/>ly the King sent an arrow against the camel and the
<div n="lb"/>camel falling down turned into a Vidyādhara and that
<div n="lb"/>Vidyādhara told the King thus:— “Oh King, there was
<div n="lb"/>once a Vidyādhara named Raṅgamālī. A Vidyādhara
<div n="lb"/>maiden named Tārāvalī was attracted by the hand-
<div n="lb"/>some form of Raṅgamālī. She married him without the
<div n="lb"/>consent of her parents. The angered father separated
<div n="lb"/>them by a curse. The curse took effect and they soon
<div n="lb"/>got separated losing their way in the forest. Pining to
<div n="lb"/>see her husband Tārāvalī roamed about in the forests
<div n="lb"/>and reached the other shore of the western sea. It was
<div n="lb"/>a colony of ṛṣis and there was a fig tree there standing
<div n="lb"/>in full blossom. Tārāvalī took the form of a beetle and
<div n="lb"/>sat on the tree sucking honey. After some days Raṅga-
<div n="lb"/>mālī also came to the place. On seeing her husband
<div n="lb"/>she had emission and from the virile fluid was born a
<div n="lb"/>fig fruit. After that both of them flew to the Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharva loka. I am Raṅgamālī. One day a sage
<div n="lb"/>named Jitāsu came that way and this fruit fell before
<div n="lb"/>him. From the fruit came out a beautiful maiden and
<div n="lb"/>Jitāsu with his divine power understood the whole
<div n="lb"/>story behind it and so took the girl to his āśrama and
<div n="lb"/>named her Vinayavatī. Vinayavatī grew into a beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful maiden and stayed in the āśrama. One day by
<div n="lb"/>accident I happened to see her and attracted by her
<div n="lb"/>beauty tried to rape her. She cried aloud and hearing
<div n="lb"/>the noise the sage came out and cursed me and turned
<div n="lb"/>me into a camel. I pleaded for mercy and the sage
<div n="lb"/>said I would be released from the curse when I was
<div n="lb"/>killed by the future husband of Vinayavatī, Puṣkarākṣa
<div n="lb"/>by name. Oh King, I am now released from the curse
<div n="lb"/>and you should go to the forest named Surabhimāruta
<div n="lb"/>on the other side of the western sea and marry that
<div n="lb"/>maiden.”
<div n="NI"/>Puṣkarākṣa was pleased to hear this and the king going
<div n="lb"/>back to the palace and entrusting the administration of
<div n="lb"/>the state to his ministers left for the forest of Surabhi-
<div n="lb"/>māruta. Reaching the shore of the western sea he was
<div n="lb"/>thinking of ways to cross the sea when he saw a
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrakālī temple nearby. When he went to the
<div n="lb"/>temple he saw a violin in front of it and taking it he
<div n="lb"/>played on it a few songs in praise of Kālī and went to
<div n="lb"/>sleep in the temple. The goddess was pleased with his
<div n="lb"/>songs and took the sleeping king to the other side of the
<div n="lb"/>sea. When he woke up next morning he saw himself
<div n="lb"/>on the other shore and was pleasantly surprised. He
<div n="lb"/>walked about on the shore and saw an āśrama and
<div n="lb"/>peeping in saw a sage sitting inside. On seeing the
<div n="lb"/>king the sage told him thus “Oh Puṣkararāja, Vinaya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī in search of whom you have come here has just
<div n="lb"/>gone to pluck flowers for her worship. She will come
<div n="lb"/>just now and you can then accept your wife of your
<div n="lb"/>previous birth as your wife of this life.”
<div n="NI"/>The king wanted to know more about Vinayavatī
<div n="lb"/>when the sage said she was his wife in his previous
<div n="lb"/>birth also. Then the sage said: “Once there was a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya called Dharmasena in Tāmralipti. He married
[Page623-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>a girl named Vidyullekhā. All their wealth was stolen
<div n="lb"/>by thieves and grief-stricken they attempted to commit
<div n="lb"/>suicide by jumping into the fire. They saw two swans
<div n="lb"/>flying towards them and without waiting for them to
<div n="lb"/>reach them they committed suicide. In their next birth
<div n="lb"/>they became a swan couple. They lived on a date tree
<div n="lb"/>during rainy seasons. Once in a storm the tree
<div n="lb"/>fell down and in the darkness each went its own way.
<div n="lb"/>In the morning the male swan started searching for his
<div n="lb"/>mate. In the end he found her in the lake of Mānasa
<div n="lb"/>in Svarga. They lived there happily till the rainy
<div n="lb"/>season was over and then they went and stayed on a
<div n="lb"/>mountain. One day a forester killed the she-swan and
<div n="lb"/>while coming with the dead swan in his hands he saw
<div n="lb"/>a set of armed men coming that way and the frightened
<div n="lb"/>forester threw the dead swan into a lake nearby.
<div n="lb"/>The dead swan came in touch with the Mṛtasañjīvanī
<div n="lb"/>herb in the pond and coming to life flew away.
<div n="NI"/>The husband swan went into another group of swans
<div n="lb"/>and lived there in sorrow. One day a fisherman came
<div n="lb"/>and caught all the swans in a net. At that time the she-
<div n="lb"/>swan came there and finding her husband in the net
<div n="lb"/>felt very sad. She was thinking of some way to get her
<div n="lb"/>husband released from the net when a man came to
<div n="lb"/>bathe in the pond. He wrapped the diamond necklace
<div n="lb"/>of his in a cloth and placed it on the shore. The she-
<div n="lb"/>swan took the necklace and flew making the fisherman
<div n="lb"/>see everything before him. Seeing the swan going
<div n="lb"/>with the necklace the fisherman went after it. The swan
<div n="lb"/>flew to a mountain nearby and placed it on its top.
<div n="lb"/>The fisherman started climbing up and the she-swan
<div n="lb"/>then flew back and released her husband from the net.
<div n="lb"/>One day while they were flying making a lotus as an
<div n="lb"/>umbrella a hunter shot them down with arrows. Fortu-
<div n="lb"/>nately the lotus fell on an idol of Śiva and by the power
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva they were born in their next birth as a king
<div n="lb"/>and a woman. The king is yourself and the woman is
<div n="lb"/>Vinayavatī.”
<div n="NI"/>Puṣkarākṣa married her there and returning to his
<div n="lb"/>land lived happily for a long period (Taraṅgā 2,
<div n="lb"/>Śaśāṅkavatīlambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
