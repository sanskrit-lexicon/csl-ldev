ĀNA II¦. (Elephant). Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa narrates the
origin of elephants thus: “Kaśyapa was born to Marīci,
son of Brahmā. Kaśyapa married the daughters, Aditi,
Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu and
Analā, of Dakṣaprajāpati. Of these Krodhavaśā gave
birth to ten girls, Mṛgī, Mṛgamadā, Harī, Bhadramatā,
Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Śvetā, Surabhi, Surasā, and Kadrū.
Elephants were born as the sons of Mātaṅgī. (Sarga 14,
Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in the Mahābhārata to explain why the
tongue of the elephant is curved inside. “Bhṛgu Maharṣi
cursed Agni and greatly dejected over this he dis-
appeared from public and hid somewhere. The Devas
started searching for him and it was an elephant that
showed the devas the hiding place of Agni. Agni then
cursed the elephants and said that thereafter all the
elephants would have their tongues curved inside. (Śloka
36, Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>The signs of good elephants and the treatment to be
accorded to sick ones are detailed in Agni Purāṇa.
“Elephants with long trunks and heavy breathing be-
long to the top class and they will possess great endu-
rance power. Those who have nails eighteen or twenty
in number and who became turbulent during winter
belong to a superior class. Those ones whose right
tusks are a bit raised, whose cry is stentorian as that of
thunder whose ears are very big and whose skins are
spotted are the best of the species. Other varieties espe-
cially the dwarfish type and she-elephants in the early
stage of pregnancy are not good and not fit to be tamed.
Elephants who have Varṇa, Sattva, Bala, Rūpa, Kānti,
Śarīraguṇa and Vega will conquer enemies in a battle;
there is no doubt about it. Elephants are an ornament
[Page088-a+ 38]
for any battle-array. The victory earned by a King with
his elephants is more respected.
<div n="NI"/>For all diseases of an elephant Anuvāsana or Sneha-
vasti is recommended. A bath after anointing it with
oil or ghee is good. For skin diseases the ghee may be
combined with Mañjal (Turmeric), Maramañjal or
gomūtra (cow urine). If it suffers from enlargement
of the belly, giving it a bath with sesame oil is good.
It can be given Pañcalavaṇas and Vāruṇīmadya to
drink. If there is fainting it must be given rice mixed
with Vlalari, Triphala, Cukku, Mulaku and Tippali
and water mixed with honey to drink. If there is head-
ache anointing the head with sesame oil and inhala-
tion of the same is good.
<div n="NI"/>For diseases of the foot, treatment with Snehapuṭas is
prescribed. To get motion of the bowels Kalkaṇṭa
Kaṣāya (infusion of sugar candy) is good. To those who
have shivers should be given the flesh of peacock,
Tittiri bird and Lāva bird mixed with Tippali and pep-
per. For dysentery the tender fruit of Kūvala, skin of
Pāccotti, flower of Tātiri should be dried and powder-
ed and be given mixed with sugar along with rice. For
Karagraha (pain inside the trunk) Nasyam of ghee with
Īntappū mixed in it should be done. It must be given
“Muttaṅga Kañci with tippali, Cukku and Jīraka in
it. For Utkarṇaka (pain in the ear) flesh of pigs should
be given. For Galagraha (pain in the neck) a liniment
made of Daśamūla, Mutirappuli and Kākkappancci in
oil should be rubbed at the site of pain and the elephant
kept under chains. If there is difficulty in passing urine
light liquor containing powdered Aṣṭalavaṇas should
be given. For all skin diseases use Vep oil as an oint-
ment and give the infusion of Āṭaloṭaka to drink. For
worms (inside the stomach) give cow's urine with pow-
dered Vlālari in it. If the elephant is getting reduced
and weak it should be given milk or meat soup with Cuk-
ku, Tippali and grapes well mixed in it. If there is lack
of appetite it is to be given Mulgaudana (rice boiled
[Page088-b+ 79]
along with Cerupayar) to which is added Cukku, Mulaku
and Tippali. If it is Gulma it should be given sesame
oil boiled with the following: Trikotpakkonna, Cukku,
Mulaku Tippali, Kotuvelikkilaṅgu, Nāgadantiveru,
Erikkinveru, Nātkkotpakkonna, Milk and Attittippali.
Navara rice with sort of cerupayar can also be given.
For swellings on the face, a paste made of tender
Kūvala fruits can be rubbed at the site of the swelling.
For all sorts of pains in the stomach rice well mixed
with the powder made by grinding together Vlālari,
Kuṭakappālayari, Asafoetida, Carala, Mañjal, Mara-
mañjal may be given.
<div n="NI"/>The best food for elephants is the rice of Navara, Vrīhi
and cennellu. Yava and wheat are next to the above.
Any other food is inferior to these. Yava and sugarcane
will give strength to elephants. Dry yava rice is not
good. Milk and meat cooked with carminative ingre-
dients are good for elephants who have gone lean.
<div n="NI"/>If the elephants receive great injuries in a battle the
meat of birds like crow, fowl, cuckoo and Hari mixed
with honey is good. Fumigation by the burning of
chilli, fish, Vlālari, caustic soda, Puttal, Pīram and
maramañjal mixed together is effective. Dropping
honey medicated with tippali tandula, sesame oil, and
fruit honey in the eyes is not only good for the eyes but
is also inducive of digestion. Make an ointment with
the faces of the birds cātaka and Pārāvata mixed with
the burnt skin of Nātpāmara dissolved in light spirit.
If this ointment is applied, the elephant would defeat
all enemies in a battle. Powder Nīlotpala, Muttaṅga
and Takara and make an ointment using rice gruel.
Applying this ointment in the eye is excellent.
<div n="NI"/>If the nails grow they should be cut at least once a
month. Once in a month an oil bath is good for the
elephants. Elephant sheds should be spread with cow-
dung discs and dust. Doing Seka with ghee during
autumn and summer is advisable. (Chapter 287, Agni
Purāṇa).
