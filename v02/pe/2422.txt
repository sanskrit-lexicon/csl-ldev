GHAṬOTKACA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Ghaṭotkaca, son of Bhīmasena played a very
<div n="lb"/>important part in the story of Mahābhārata. He was,
<div n="lb"/>from his very birth, a staunch friend and ally of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. He courted a hero's death in the great war.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} On the burning of the ‘lac Palace’ the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas escaped through a tunnel and reached a forest.
<div n="lb"/>While they were sleeping on the ground, Hiḍiṃba the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa chief in the forest saw the Pāṇḍavas from the
<div n="lb"/>top of a tree, and he deputed his sister Hiḍimbī to
<div n="lb"/>bring over the Pāṇḍavas to him for food.
<div n="NI"/>Hiḍiṃbī approached the Pāṇḍavas in the guise of a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful woman. She was attracted towards Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>and she prayed for the return of his love, which Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>refused. Impatient at the delay Hiḍiṃba rushed to-
<div n="lb"/>wards the Pāṇḍavas, and in the duel that ensued
<div n="lb"/>between him and Bhīma, he was killed by Bhīma.
[Page290-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Then Hiḍiṃbī approached Kuntī and requested her to
<div n="lb"/>ask Bhīma to marry her. The Pāṇḍavas agreed to the
<div n="lb"/>proposal on condition that Bhīma and Hiḍiṃbī should
<div n="lb"/>enjoy their honeymoon in the forest and on mountains,
<div n="lb"/>but Bhīma should return to them at dusk everyday.
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca was the son born to Bhīma and Hiḍimbī,
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 155).
<div n="NI"/>Indra bestowed on Ghaṭotkaca prowess enough to be a
<div n="lb"/>suitable opponent to Karṇa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 155,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 47).
<div n="NI"/>Ghaṭotkaca grew up to become a good friend of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. When Hiḍiṃbī and Ghaṭotkaca took leave of
<div n="lb"/>them Kuntī said to Ghaṭotkaca: “You are the eldest
<div n="lb"/>son to the Pāṇḍavas. You should be ever a support to
<div n="lb"/>them.” To this Ghaṭotkaca answered that he would
<div n="lb"/>return to them whenever any need arose for it.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Carried the Pāṇḍavas on shoulders.%} During their exile
<div n="lb"/>in the forest the Pāṇḍavas became too tired to walk any
<div n="lb"/>further when Bhīma remembered Ghaṭotkaca, who
<div n="lb"/>promptly appeared before the Pāṇḍavas, and at the
<div n="lb"/>instance of Bhīma got down a number of Rākṣasas also.
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca carrying Pāñcālī on his shoulders, and the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas carrying the Pāṇḍava brothers on their
<div n="lb"/>shoulders went by air to Badarikāśrama where
<div n="lb"/>Naranārāyaṇas were doing tapas, landed them there,
<div n="lb"/>and then they (Ghaṭotkaca and his companions) took
<div n="lb"/>leave of the Pāṇḍavas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 145).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ghaṭotkaca in the great war.%} (1) In the first day's
<div n="lb"/>fighting he fought against Alambuṣa, Duryodhana and
<div n="lb"/>Bhagadatta. Frightened at the terrible course of the
<div n="lb"/>fight the Kauravas purposely postponed that day's
<div n="lb"/>fighting. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapters, 45, 57, 58).
<div n="NI"/>(2) He defeated the King of Vaṅga and killed his
<div n="lb"/>elephant. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 92, Verse 36).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Defeated Vikarṇa. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 29, Verse
<div n="lb"/>36).
<div n="NI"/>(4) On receiving blows from the great Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>heroes, Ghaṭotkaca rose up to the sky. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 93, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Ghaṭotkaca made the Kaurava army take to
<div n="lb"/>their heels by the exercise of his magic powers. (Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 94, Verses 41-47).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Fought a duel with Durmukha. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 110, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Dhṛtarāṣṭra praised the prowess of Ghaṭotkaca.
<div n="lb"/>(Droṇa Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 62).
<div n="NI"/>(8) He fought with Alāyudha. (Droṇa Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 96, Verse 27).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Killed Alambuṣa. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 109,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 28).
<div n="NI"/>(10) Aśvatthāmā, son of Droṇa killed Añjana Parvā,
<div n="lb"/>son of Ghaṭotkaca, (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 156, Verse
<div n="lb"/>56).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Ghaṭotkaca fought with Karṇa. (Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 175).
<div n="NI"/>(12) He fought with Jaṭāsura. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>174).
<div n="NI"/>(13) He killed Alāyudha. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 178,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 31).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Karṇa clashed with Ghaṭotkaca and failing to
<div n="lb"/>kill him by any means he (Karṇa) used Vaijayantī
<div n="lb"/>Śakti as the last resort. This Śakti had been given to
<div n="lb"/>him by Indra in exchange for his head-gear and ear-
<div n="lb"/>rings, and Karṇa had been keeping the Śakti in res-
<div n="lb"/>erve to kill Arjuna. At any rate Karṇa used it against
[Page291-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca and he was killed. After killing Ghaṭot-
<div n="lb"/>kaca the Śakti entered the sphere of the stars. (Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 180).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other information.%} (1) Ghaṭotkaca hated the bra-
<div n="lb"/>hmins and their yajñas. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 181,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 27).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When the souls of the heroes killed in the great
<div n="lb"/>war were called upon the banks of Gaṅgā by Vyāsa,
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca's soul too had appeared. (Āśramavāsika
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 32, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>(3) After death he lived with Yakṣadevas. (Svargāro-
<div n="lb"/>haṇa Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 37).
