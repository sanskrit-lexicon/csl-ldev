NANDĀ II¦. A river. Mention is made in Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 214, Stanza 6, that while Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>had been engaged in a pilgrimage visiting the holy
<div n="lb"/>places in the east, he reached the banks of the rivers
<div n="lb"/>Nandā and Aparanandā. Many of the scholars are of
<div n="lb"/>opinion that this river flowed through the eastern side
<div n="lb"/>of the forest Naimiṣaraṇya. When the hermit Dhaumya
<div n="lb"/>talks about the holy places of the east to Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb"/>he says as follows about the river Nandā. “The beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful mountain ‘Kuṇḍoda’ is a place which abounds in
<div n="lb"/>roots, fruits and water. Nala the King of Niṣadha, who
<div n="lb"/>was weary of thirst rested here. There is a holy temple
<div n="lb"/>here called Devavana which is thronged by hermits.
<div n="lb"/>Near this temple there is a mountain through the top
<div n="lb"/>of which, two rivers Bāhudā and Nandā flow.” (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 87).
<div n="NI"/>During the time of the forest life of the Pāṇḍavas,
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira travelled with the hermit Lomaśa, through
<div n="lb"/>the basin of the rivers Nandā, and Aparanandā. During
<div n="lb"/>the Paurāṇic times some deities had lived in the basin
<div n="lb"/>of the river Nandā, and men began to come there to
<div n="lb"/>visit the deities. The devas (gods) did not like this and
<div n="lb"/>so they rendered the place inaccessible to men. From
<div n="lb"/>that time onwards the river basin of Nandā and the
[Page524-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>mount Hemakūṭa have become prohibited area for
<div n="lb"/>human beings. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 110).
