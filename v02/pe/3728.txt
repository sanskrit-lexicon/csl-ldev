KṢEMADARŚĪ¦. A King of Kosala. There is a story
in the Mahābhārata stating how the hermit Kālaka-
vṛkṣīya saved this King from the trap laid by his
favourites. The treasury-keeper spent the money of the
King lavishly on himself. The subjects began to
consider how to inform the King about this. Finally
[Page433-b+ 64]
the hermit Kālakavṛkṣīya began to travel throughout
the country with a crow kept in a cage. As if the
crow was speaking, the hermit began to tell the past,
present and future fortunes of the people. The crow
became famous and people began to have faith in the
crow. Once Kālakavṛkṣīya and the crow reached the
palace and under the pretence that the crow was speak-
ing, the hermit disclosed all the secret dealings of the
treasury-keeper. The servants of the King stealthily
put the crow to death that night. When the King
knew this he made Kālakavṛkṣīya the minister and the
country began to prosper. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter
82).
<div n="NI"/>On another occasion the treasury of the King Kṣema-
darśī became empty. At this time King Janaka had
come to war with this King. According to the sincere
advice of Kālakavṛkṣīya the King married the daughter
of King Janaka. From that day onwards his country
became prosperous. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 106).
