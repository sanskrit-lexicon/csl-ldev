DĪPAKARṆI¦. A character in Guṇāḍhya's Bṛhatkathā.
Dīpakarṇi was a King. He had a wife named
Śaktimatī. One day while she was sleeping in the gar-
den she was bitten by a snake and she died. Distressed
by her departure, Dīpakarṇi accepted Brahmacarya.
He was deeply grieved because he had no son to
succeed to his throne. One day Śiva appeared to him
in a dream and told him thus:—“When you pass
through the forest, you will come across a youth riding
a lion. Take him to your palace; he will be your son.”
<div n="NI"/>Dīpakarṇi woke up happily. He had faith in his dream.
One day he went to a distant forest for hunting.
There he saw a very handsome boy riding on a lion.
He was reminded of his dream when the boy dismounted
[Page243-a+ 62]
and the lion walked away slowly to a nearby stream to
drink water. At once Dīpakarṇi shot an arrow at the
lion. Suddenly the lion gave up its animal shape and
transformed itself into a man and spoke to the King as
follows:—
<div n="NI"/>I am a Yakṣa named Sāta and a friend of Vaiśravaṇa.
Once when I went to bathe in the river Gaṅgā, I
happened to see a Ṛṣi virgin and I fell in love with her.
I married her according to the Gāndharva rules. The
Ṛṣis who came to know of it turned us into a lion
couple by their curse. When we fell at their feet and
begged pardon, they gave her a blessing that a son
would be born to her and that I would fall under your
arrow. After that we were wandering about as a
lion-couple and in due course she became pregnant.
In the fullness of time she gave birth to this boy and
then was liberated from the curse. I have been bringing
him up by giving the milk of lionesses. Now, by being
hit by your arrow, I am also released from the curse.
From this time kindly receive this mighty youth as
your own.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this, the Yakṣa vanished. Dīpakarṇi
returned to the palace, taking the boy with him. Since
he was carried by Sāta, the boy was named “Sātavā-
hana”. When he grew up into a youth, Dīpakarṇi
handed over the rule of the kingdom to him and
entered into Vānaprastha. In course of time Sātavāhana
became an emperor. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭha
lambaka, 6th Taraṅga.).
