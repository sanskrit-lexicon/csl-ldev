<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Viṣṇu, Brahmā, Kaśyapa and Ariṣṭanemi.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Tapaśśakti of Ariṣṭanemi.%} Ariṣṭanemi with his son
<div n="lb"/>was once performing tapas in the forest. The son was
<div n="lb"/>immersed in meditation clad in the skin of a deer thus
<div n="lb"/>looking like a deer. Parapurañjaya, the King of Hehaya
<div n="lb"/>who happened at the time to be hunting in the forest
<div n="lb"/>discharged his arrow against the son of Ariṣṭanemi taking
<div n="lb"/>him for a deer. When the king found out the real fact
<div n="lb"/>he felt extremely sorry, and he craved pardon of the
<div n="lb"/>boy's father for unwittingly killing his son. Then Ariṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>nemi pointing out his son who was standing alive
<div n="lb"/>asked the King, “Is this the boy whom you killed?”
<div n="lb"/>The King was naturally wonder-struck. But Ariṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>nemi told the King that there was nothing to wonder
<div n="lb"/>at in the case as nobody would be able to kill them be-
<div n="lb"/>cause their Tapaśśakti was so great. The King felt so
<div n="lb"/>happy at this, and returned to his palace after prostrat-
<div n="lb"/>ing at the feet of the sage. (M.B., Araṇya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 184).
