NĪLĀ¦. II. A Gopikā. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was one day picnicking
in Vṛndāvana with the Gopī women, and they were
proud that he was mad after them. To dispel their
pride Kṛṣṇa disappeared abruptly from their midst and
sported with the woman called Nīlā. Then she also
became proud that Kṛṣṇa loved her more than the
others, and she asked him to carry her on his shoulders.
He stood there ready stretching his neck to carry her.
But, when she stood with her legs parted to mount on
Kṛṣṇa's neck and looked for him he was missing; he had
already disappeared. The Gopikās ultimately shed
their pride and then Kṛṣṇa appeared before them.
(Ceruśśeri's Malayālam Epic Kṛṣṇa Gāthā).
