ILĀ I¦. Daughter of Vaivasvata Manu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in this order:—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vaivasvata Manu—Ilā.
<div n="lb"/>Vaivasvata Manu was the son of Kaśyapa by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, and Ilā the daughter of Vaivasvata Manu by his
<div n="lb"/>wife, Śraddhā. Ikṣvāku, the ancestral father of the solar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty of Kings was brother of Ilā.
<div n="NI"/>2) Vaivasvata Manu and Śraddhā had, for a long
<div n="lb"/>time no children. Manu got performed once by Agastya
<div n="lb"/>a yajña to propitiate the Mitrāvaruṇas so that a son
<div n="lb"/>might be born to him (Manu). Soon a daughter was
<div n="lb"/>born to him and she was called Ilā. Then Manu
<div n="lb"/>asked Vasiṣtha why a daughter was born to him
<div n="lb"/>instead of a son for whom the yajña was performed by
<div n="lb"/>Agastya. At once, Vasiṣtha by his will-power turned
<div n="lb"/>the girl Ilā into a boy, and the boy was named Sud-
<div n="lb"/>yumna. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sudyumna again turned into woman.%} Once Śunaka
<div n="lb"/>and some other sages went to the great forest Kumāra
<div n="lb"/>Vana near Kailāsa to salute Sri Parameśvara ignorant
<div n="lb"/>of the fact that just then Pārvatī and Parmeśvara were
<div n="lb"/>enjoying themselves. The sudden appearance of Śunaka
<div n="lb"/>and others was not relished by the divine couple, who
<div n="lb"/>were then naked. They therefore, pronounced the curse
<div n="lb"/>that anybody who entered the forest in future would be
<div n="lb"/>turned into a woman. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Sudyumna, now a young man, went for hunting one day.
<div n="lb"/>Sudyumna who was ignorant of this curse entered this
<div n="lb"/>forest with his friends while hunting. At once all of
<div n="lb"/>them were transformed into women. Grief-stricken,
<div n="lb"/>they stayed in the forest for some days, and then started
<div n="lb"/>for the palace. Sudyumna bearing the name Ilā walked
<div n="lb"/>at the head of the party as a beautiful woman. On the
<div n="lb"/>way Budha met Ilā, they fell in love with each other
<div n="lb"/>and got married. A son, Purūravas was born to Budha
<div n="lb"/>by Ilā. (Bhāgavata).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Transformation again;%} Ilā expressed to Vasiṣṭha, her
<div n="lb"/>grief at having been turned into a woman, the sage
<div n="lb"/>requested Śrī Parameśvara to restore her to her former
<div n="lb"/>form as a man. Śiva said that Ilā would be a man and
<div n="lb"/>a woman every alternate month, throughout life. Dur-
<div n="lb"/>ing the month when she was a man he would engage
<div n="lb"/>himself in matters of Government, and the next month,
<div n="lb"/>when a woman, she would stay in the inner apartments
<div n="lb"/>in the palace. Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 32 says
<div n="lb"/>that Ikṣvāku, brother of Purūravas ruled the state till
<div n="lb"/>the latter became a major. As soon as Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>attained majority Sudyumna handed over to him the
<div n="lb"/>reins of Government and retired to the forest for tapas,
<div n="lb"/>and during this period he was taught the Navākṣara
<div n="lb"/>mantra by sage Nārada. Sudyumna adored Devī with
<div n="lb"/>this Mantra. She appeared to him and blessed him with
<div n="lb"/>the state of salvation. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Purūravas married Urvaśī, and ruled the country.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha; Devī Bhāgavata, First Skan-
<div n="lb"/>dha; M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 75 and Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 147, Verse 26).
