LAṄKĀLAKṢMĪ¦. A Devī who was relieved of her curse
<div n="lb"/>by a hard stroke of his hand by Hanūmān.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%How she came to Laṅkā.%} Laṅkālakṣmī was Vijaya-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī in her previous birth. She was the watch-girl of
<div n="lb"/>the treasury of Brahmā and one day finding her negli-
<div n="lb"/>gent of her duties Brahmā cursed her “Go to the earth
<div n="lb"/>and be the watch-girl of the palace-gate tower of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa”. She begged for relief and Brahmā said, “Dur-
<div n="lb"/>ing the incarnation of Viṣṇu as Rāma his wife Sītā will
<div n="lb"/>be carried away by Rāvaṇa and Hanūmān will come in
<div n="lb"/>search of her to Laṅkā. You will then block the way of
<div n="lb"/>that mightly monkey and he will then strike you down
<div n="lb"/>by a fierce blow of his hand. You will be then released
<div n="lb"/>from the curse and come back to me.”
[Page451-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Vijayalakṣmī accordingly was born in Laṅkā and
<div n="lb"/>became the watch-girl of Rāvaṇa's palace.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Release from the curse.%} Hanūmān coming to Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>in search of Sītā tried to find an opening through
<div n="lb"/>which to enter Laṅkā. Then he saw a huge tower-gate
<div n="lb"/>on the northern side of the mountain Suvelagiri.
<div n="lb"/>When he reached the gate he found it closed. The
<div n="lb"/>mighty monkey beat hard on the door and the strong
<div n="lb"/>door burst into two and fell on to the floor. Instantly a
<div n="lb"/>ferocious woman of enormous size rushed to the gate
<div n="lb"/>with a piercing roar and blocked it. Hanūmān found
<div n="lb"/>the situation dangerous and so gave her a powerful
<div n="lb"/>blow and felled her. She then very politely asked
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān who he was and Hanūmān revealed his
<div n="lb"/>identity and told her the purpose of his visit. Lankā-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī then took leave of Hanūmān and leaving
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā went to Śrī Rāma and worshipped him. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>blessed her and she returned to Satyaloka and started
<div n="lb"/>doing her duties as before. (Sundara Kāṇḍa, Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
