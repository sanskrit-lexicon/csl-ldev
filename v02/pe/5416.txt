PRIYAVRATA¦. The eldest son of Svāyambhuva Manu.
<div n="lb"/>He had another son named Uttānapāda and three
<div n="lb"/>daughters named Ākūti, Devahūti and Prasūti. The
<div n="lb"/>daughters were married to Ruci, Kardama and Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>respectively. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Priyavrata married Barhiṣmatī daughter of Kardama-
<div n="lb"/>prajāpati. He got of her two daughters named Samrāṭ
<div n="lb"/>and Kukṣi and ten sons named Agnīdhra, Agnibāhu,
<div n="lb"/>Vapuṣmān, Dyutimān, Medhas, Medhātithi, Bhavya,
<div n="lb"/>Savana, Putra and Jyotiṣmān. Of these Jyotiṣmān was
<div n="lb"/>really possessing jyotis (brilliance). All the sons,
<div n="lb"/>Medhas, Agnibāhū and Putra, were interested in the
<div n="lb"/>practice of yoga and were aware of their previous births.
<div n="lb"/>Priyavrata distributed seven islands to seven of his sons
<div n="lb"/>as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Jambūdvīpa to Agnīdhra; Plakṣadvīpa to Medhātithi;
<div n="lb"/>Śālmalīdvīpa to Vapuṣmān; Kuśadvīpa to Jyotiṣmān;
<div n="lb"/>Krauñcadvīpa to Dyutimān; Śākadvīpa to Bhavya;
<div n="lb"/>and Puṣkaradvīpa to Savana.
<div n="NI"/>Agnīdhra had nine sons named Nābhi, Kimpuruṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Harivarṣa, Ilāvṛta, Ramya, Hiraṇvān, Kuru, Bhadrāśva
<div n="lb"/>and Ketumāla. (Chapter 1, Aṃśa 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Priyavrata once circled round Meru in his chariot. As
<div n="lb"/>if competing with the Sun Priyavrata started his circling
<div n="lb"/>along with sunrise and ended it at sunset. He did so
<div n="lb"/>seven days making nights look like day and the sun
<div n="lb"/>appear dim and faded. The Sun was dejected and it
<div n="lb"/>was at the request of the Trimūrtis that Priyavrata
<div n="lb"/>stopped his circumambulation. It was the path of Priya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata's circling for seven days that later became the seven
<div n="lb"/>oceans of Purāṇic fame. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
