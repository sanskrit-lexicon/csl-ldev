DĀŚRĀJÑA¦. A great war which took place in India in
ancient times. It was a terrible clash between the Āryans
who lived in Pañcanada and the primitive inhabitants
of India, before the Ṛgveda period. Sudās, the king
was the adversary of the Āryans. Among the relatives of
Sudās were Āryans and non-Āryans. It was the people
under Sudās who got victory in this war. Anyway,
with this war, (Dāśarājña), a new mixed race of people
came into being in North India, which was composed
of the Āryans and the primitive inhabitants of the country.
The Hindus are the descendants of this mixed race.
(Ṛgveda).
