CYAVANA¦. A celebrated sage of the Bhārgava dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu—Cyavana.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Bhṛgu is the son of Brahmā born of Agni at the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmayajña conducted by Varuṇa. The beautiful and
<div n="lb"/>virtuous lady Pulomā was the wife of Bhṛgu. Even be-
<div n="lb"/>fore Bhṛgu married her she was being loved by the demon
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā and her marriage with Bhṛgu embittered him
<div n="lb"/>and he waited for an opportunity to kidnap Pulomā.
<div n="NI"/>One day when Bhṛgu went to the river for his bath
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā entered the āśrama and there he found his love
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā being watched over by Agni. Pulomā compelled
<div n="lb"/>Agni to tell him the truth whether Bhṛgu had married
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā according to the rites enjoined by the scriptures.
<div n="lb"/>Agni confessed that it was not so and then Pulomā
<div n="lb"/>taking the shape of a hog carried away Pulomā who was
<div n="lb"/>then in a stage of advanced pregnancy. On the way the
<div n="lb"/>wife of the sage delivered and the babe dropped to the
<div n="lb"/>ground. Because the babe was born with a fall (Cyavana)
<div n="lb"/>from the womb the boy was named Cyavana. The
<div n="lb"/>radiance of the boy burnt the demon into ashes. Pulomā
<div n="lb"/>weeping profusely with tears rolling down her cheeks
<div n="lb"/>returned to the āśrama. Her tears ran into a river and the
<div n="lb"/>river got the name Vadhūsarā Bhṛgu on knowing how all
<div n="lb"/>happened cursed Agni saying that Agni would thereafter
<div n="lb"/>be an all-round eater. (eating anything and everything).
<div n="lb"/>(Chapters 5 and 6, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Penance and marriage.%} Even when he was very
<div n="lb"/>young Cyavana commenced practising austerities.
<div n="lb"/>He went to the forests and sat in meditation without food
<div n="lb"/>or sleep, oblivious to what happened outside. Years went
<div n="lb"/>by and Cyavana did not stir from his place. Gradually
<div n="lb"/>earth began to cover him and soon he was completely
<div n="lb"/>enveloped by earth. Creepers grew on it and birds made
<div n="lb"/>rests; Cyavana did not know anything about it.
[Page190-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>One day Śaryāti with his wives and children came to
<div n="lb"/>that forest for a picnic. Sukanyā, daughter of King
<div n="lb"/>Śaryāti, along with her companions separated from the
<div n="lb"/>King and roamed about in the forest making merry.
<div n="lb"/>They soon came to the place where Cyavana sat doing
<div n="lb"/>penance. There was an unusual radiance around the
<div n="lb"/>heap of earth they saw there and Sukanyā out of curiosity
<div n="lb"/>started striking down the earth. Then from inside came
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana's voice advising her not to crumble down the
<div n="lb"/>earth as she was doing. Sukanyā ignored the advice and
<div n="lb"/>searched for the source of the voice. She then saw two
<div n="lb"/>points of glow and taking a thorn gave two pricks at
<div n="lb"/>those points and left the place with her companions.
<div n="NI"/>Those glow-points were the eyes of Cyavana and Cya-
<div n="lb"/>vana felt insufferable pain when his eyes were thus pierced
<div n="lb"/>through. But he neither became angry nor cursed the
<div n="lb"/>girl who did this havoc. Cyavana went on with his
<div n="lb"/>penance. But soon the country of Śaryāti began to expe-
<div n="lb"/>rience the bad effects of this evil-deed. People one by one
<div n="lb"/>in the beginning and then the whole lot were disabled
<div n="lb"/>from passing either urine or faeces. From men and
<div n="lb"/>women the disease spread to the animals also. The country
<div n="lb"/>was in a chaos and the subjects flocked to the palace to
<div n="lb"/>complain to the King. Śaryāti knew that somebody must
<div n="lb"/>have in a some way tormented Cyavana and enquired
<div n="lb"/>of each and everyone of his subjects. Whether anybody
<div n="lb"/>had knowingly or unknowingly given pain to Cyavana.
<div n="lb"/>Nobody had done so and the King was worried. Then
<div n="lb"/>Sukanyā ran to her father and confessed what she had
<div n="lb"/>done. The King ran immediately to the place where
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana was doing penance and striking down the earth
<div n="lb"/>prostrated before the sage who was sitting there sad and
<div n="lb"/>miserable. The King apologised to Cyavana and reques-
<div n="lb"/>ted him to pardon his daughter.
<div n="NI"/>Cyavana then told the King that it was enough if he
<div n="lb"/>gave his daughter in marriage to him in expiation of the
<div n="lb"/>harm done. The King was shocked to hear this for
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana was not only ugly but now blind also. The
<div n="lb"/>King returned to the palace sad and worried and there
<div n="lb"/>was gloom over the whole palace. But Sukanyā approa-
<div n="lb"/>ched her father and agreed to be the wife of Cyavana.
<div n="lb"/>The problem was solved and the King with great reluc-
<div n="lb"/>tance took his daughter to the forests and gave her in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to Cyavana.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Cyavana attains eternal youth.%} It was the time when
<div n="lb"/>Indra had banned Somapāna (drinking of the yāga wine)
<div n="lb"/>to the Aśvinīdevas. Discontented at this they roamed
<div n="lb"/>about in the forests and soon came to the neighbourhood
<div n="lb"/>of the āśrama of Cyavana.
<div n="NI"/>Sukanyā after becoming the wife of Cyavana did all she
<div n="lb"/>could to make her husband comfortable and happy.
<div n="lb"/>She would collect very sweet and tasty fruit from the
<div n="lb"/>forests and give him. She would bathe him in hot water.
<div n="lb"/>After arranging all the materials needed for the morning
<div n="lb"/>rites like yava, sesame, darbha and water, she would
<div n="lb"/>take her husband to the place of the pūjā leading him
<div n="lb"/>by hand. When the morning pūjā was over she would
<div n="lb"/>seat him in a suitable place and give him rice and fruits.
<div n="lb"/>After the meals she would give him pan to chew. Only
<div n="lb"/>after doing all these would she go to do her daily rites
<div n="lb"/>and that too only after obtaining her husband's permis-
<div n="lb"/>sion. She would finish her routine in no time to come
<div n="lb"/>back to her husband to see whether he was in need of
<div n="lb"/>anything. Then she would make arrangements for the
<div n="lb"/>evening pūjā and after the pūjā was over she would give
[Page190-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>him his dinner. She would eat only what was left by
<div n="lb"/>her husband. At night she would spread a soft bedding
<div n="lb"/>and lull him to sleep. Then she would take a nap lying
<div n="lb"/>at the foot of her husband. During summer she would
<div n="lb"/>fan him and during winter she would make fire to give
<div n="lb"/>him heat. Early morning she would take him to a dis-
<div n="lb"/>tant place for his excretion and after washing him would
<div n="lb"/>seat him in a suitable place for cleaning his teeth and
<div n="lb"/>face. Then the routine would start with great devotion
<div n="lb"/>again.
<div n="NI"/>One day Sukanyā was returning from the river after her
<div n="lb"/>bath and on the way she came across the Aśvinīdevas.
<div n="lb"/>They were astounded to see such a beautiful damsel in
<div n="lb"/>the forest and they accosted her and requested her to
<div n="lb"/>select one of them as her husband. Knowing her identity
<div n="lb"/>they advised her to forsake her old and blind husband and
<div n="lb"/>come and live with one of them. She flew into a fury
<div n="lb"/>when she heard her husband spoken of so slightingly
<div n="lb"/>and by logical argument convinced them the error of
<div n="lb"/>their request. Then they told her thus: “You are aware
<div n="lb"/>we are the physicians of the devas. We can give back
<div n="lb"/>eyesight to your husband and make him as beautiful
<div n="lb"/>as one of us. We will then appear before you as three
<div n="lb"/>lovely young men identical in appearance and then you
<div n="lb"/>must select one among the three as your husband.”
<div n="NI"/>Sukanyā was immensely pleased as well as surprised to
<div n="lb"/>hear the offer and was eager to see her husband young
<div n="lb"/>and beautiful. But the last condition frightened her.
<div n="lb"/>Anyhow she promised to give a reply after consulting her
<div n="lb"/>husband and ran to the āśrama to tell her husband the
<div n="lb"/>news. Cyavana advised her to accept the offer of the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīdevas and Sukanyā ran back to the Aśvinīdevas
<div n="lb"/>and brought them to her husband accepting their terms.
<div n="lb"/>The Aśvinīdevas took the aged and blind Cyavana along
<div n="lb"/>with them to the river nearby and the three plunged into
<div n="lb"/>the river. When they rose up after a dip the three emer-
<div n="lb"/>ged as young, lovely and charming triplets difficult to be
<div n="lb"/>distinguished from one another. When Sukanyā stood
<div n="lb"/>before the three to select her real husband she prayed to
<div n="lb"/>her goddess and the Devī gave her the power to identify
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana and so she correctly chose him from the three.
<div n="lb"/>(Saptama Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Cyavana defeated Indra.%} Immensely pleased at re-
<div n="lb"/>gaining his eyesight and youth Cyavana asked the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas what they wanted. The Aśvinīdevas replied that
<div n="lb"/>Indra had banned wine to them and they would like to
<div n="lb"/>have the ban lifted. Cyavana Maharṣi immediately
<div n="lb"/>commenced a Somayāga to which were invited all the
<div n="lb"/>devas and the Aśvinīdevas also. When Indra saw the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīdevas standing to partake of the Soma wine he was
<div n="lb"/>furious and objected to the wine being given to them.
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana dissented and a fight ensued between Indra and
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana. Indra raised his weapon ‘Vajrāyudha’ to
<div n="lb"/>strike at Cyavana and then Cyavana made all his limbs
<div n="lb"/>go stiff. He then raised from the sacrificial fire a fiendish
<div n="lb"/>demon called Mada to kill the devas. All those present
<div n="lb"/>were frightened by this demon and they ran away. But
<div n="lb"/>Indra could not run for his limbs were stiff. Standing
<div n="lb"/>there he prayed to his preceptor Bṛhaspati for help and
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati advised Indra to surrender to Cyavana. Indra
<div n="lb"/>bowed his head before Cyavana and prayed to be ex-
<div n="lb"/>cused. Cyavana was pleased and withdrawing the demon
<div n="lb"/>tore him into four pieces and threw one each into Dice,
<div n="lb"/>Hunting, Wine and Women. The devas and Aśvinīdevas
<div n="lb"/>then went back to heaven. (Saptama Skandha, Devī
[Page191-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata. Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 17, Sūkta
<div n="lb"/>116; Chapter 123, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Paraśurāma once came and stayed at the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana. At that time Bhṛgu and Cyavana were in the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama. They blessed him and advised him to go to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa and do penance there to propitiate Śiva. It was
<div n="lb"/>thus that Paraśurāma happened to go to Kailāsa to do
<div n="lb"/>penance there. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 62).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Cyavana got a son named Pramati. This Pramati
<div n="lb"/>was the father of Ruru and the grandfather of Śunaka.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 5, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Cyavana married Āruṣi daughter of Manu. Aurva
<div n="lb"/>was the son born to Āruṣi from her thigh. In descending
<div n="lb"/>order from Aurva were born Ṛcīka—Jamadagni—
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma. (Chapter 66, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Āstīka learnt Sāṅga Vedas from the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>of Cyavana. (Chapter 48, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Cyavana was the guru of Bhīṣma. (Śloka 11,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 37, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) King Yuvanāśva once went to the āśrama of Cyavana
<div n="lb"/>greatly worried over the lack of a descendant. Cyavana
<div n="lb"/>prepared some sacred water made potent with the recital
<div n="lb"/>of mantras to induce gestation and kept it there. Acci-
<div n="lb"/>dentally the King drank that water and got pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>The pregnancy developed without miscarriage and in due
<div n="lb"/>time the King gave birth to a child, the left side of his
<div n="lb"/>stomach bursting forth to push out the child. It was this
<div n="lb"/>child who became Māndhātā. (Chapter 126, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Cyavana was a brilliant member of the court of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. (Śloka 11, Chapter 22, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Cyavana went to Pātāla (nether-world). (See under
<div n="lb"/>Kekaralohita).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Once the august Vedaśarmā of Kauśīkagotra went
<div n="lb"/>to the āśrama of Cyavana lost in thought. Cyavana recei-
<div n="lb"/>ved him with due respect and enquired about the reason
<div n="lb"/>for his sorrow. Vedaśarmā then told him that the lack of a
<div n="lb"/>son worried him much. Cyavana then blessed him and
<div n="lb"/>assured him of a child soon. (Chapter 14, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(10) Cyavana had a daughter named Sumanas and she
<div n="lb"/>was married to a sage called Somaśarmā. (Chapter 14,
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa).
