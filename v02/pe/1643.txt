CYAVANA¦. A celebrated sage of the Bhārgava dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Brahmā—
Bhṛgu—Cyavana.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Bhṛgu is the son of Brahmā born of Agni at the
Brahmayajña conducted by Varuṇa. The beautiful and
virtuous lady Pulomā was the wife of Bhṛgu. Even be-
fore Bhṛgu married her she was being loved by the demon
Pulomā and her marriage with Bhṛgu embittered him
and he waited for an opportunity to kidnap Pulomā.
<div n="NI"/>One day when Bhṛgu went to the river for his bath
Pulomā entered the āśrama and there he found his love
Pulomā being watched over by Agni. Pulomā compelled
Agni to tell him the truth whether Bhṛgu had married
Pulomā according to the rites enjoined by the scriptures.
Agni confessed that it was not so and then Pulomā
taking the shape of a hog carried away Pulomā who was
then in a stage of advanced pregnancy. On the way the
wife of the sage delivered and the babe dropped to the
ground. Because the babe was born with a fall (Cyavana)
from the womb the boy was named Cyavana. The
radiance of the boy burnt the demon into ashes. Pulomā
weeping profusely with tears rolling down her cheeks
returned to the āśrama. Her tears ran into a river and the
river got the name Vadhūsarā Bhṛgu on knowing how all
happened cursed Agni saying that Agni would thereafter
be an all-round eater. (eating anything and everything).
(Chapters 5 and 6, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Penance and marriage.%} Even when he was very
young Cyavana commenced practising austerities.
He went to the forests and sat in meditation without food
or sleep, oblivious to what happened outside. Years went
by and Cyavana did not stir from his place. Gradually
earth began to cover him and soon he was completely
enveloped by earth. Creepers grew on it and birds made
rests; Cyavana did not know anything about it.
[Page190-a+ 65]
One day Śaryāti with his wives and children came to
that forest for a picnic. Sukanyā, daughter of King
Śaryāti, along with her companions separated from the
King and roamed about in the forest making merry.
They soon came to the place where Cyavana sat doing
penance. There was an unusual radiance around the
heap of earth they saw there and Sukanyā out of curiosity
started striking down the earth. Then from inside came
Cyavana's voice advising her not to crumble down the
earth as she was doing. Sukanyā ignored the advice and
searched for the source of the voice. She then saw two
points of glow and taking a thorn gave two pricks at
those points and left the place with her companions.
<div n="NI"/>Those glow-points were the eyes of Cyavana and Cya-
vana felt insufferable pain when his eyes were thus pierced
through. But he neither became angry nor cursed the
girl who did this havoc. Cyavana went on with his
penance. But soon the country of Śaryāti began to expe-
rience the bad effects of this evil-deed. People one by one
in the beginning and then the whole lot were disabled
from passing either urine or faeces. From men and
women the disease spread to the animals also. The country
was in a chaos and the subjects flocked to the palace to
complain to the King. Śaryāti knew that somebody must
have in a some way tormented Cyavana and enquired
of each and everyone of his subjects. Whether anybody
had knowingly or unknowingly given pain to Cyavana.
Nobody had done so and the King was worried. Then
Sukanyā ran to her father and confessed what she had
done. The King ran immediately to the place where
Cyavana was doing penance and striking down the earth
prostrated before the sage who was sitting there sad and
miserable. The King apologised to Cyavana and reques-
ted him to pardon his daughter.
<div n="NI"/>Cyavana then told the King that it was enough if he
gave his daughter in marriage to him in expiation of the
harm done. The King was shocked to hear this for
Cyavana was not only ugly but now blind also. The
King returned to the palace sad and worried and there
was gloom over the whole palace. But Sukanyā approa-
ched her father and agreed to be the wife of Cyavana.
The problem was solved and the King with great reluc-
tance took his daughter to the forests and gave her in
marriage to Cyavana.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Cyavana attains eternal youth.%} It was the time when
Indra had banned Somapāna (drinking of the yāga wine)
to the Aśvinīdevas. Discontented at this they roamed
about in the forests and soon came to the neighbourhood
of the āśrama of Cyavana.
<div n="NI"/>Sukanyā after becoming the wife of Cyavana did all she
could to make her husband comfortable and happy.
She would collect very sweet and tasty fruit from the
forests and give him. She would bathe him in hot water.
After arranging all the materials needed for the morning
rites like yava, sesame, darbha and water, she would
take her husband to the place of the pūjā leading him
by hand. When the morning pūjā was over she would
seat him in a suitable place and give him rice and fruits.
After the meals she would give him pan to chew. Only
after doing all these would she go to do her daily rites
and that too only after obtaining her husband's permis-
sion. She would finish her routine in no time to come
back to her husband to see whether he was in need of
anything. Then she would make arrangements for the
evening pūjā and after the pūjā was over she would give
[Page190-b+ 65]
him his dinner. She would eat only what was left by
her husband. At night she would spread a soft bedding
and lull him to sleep. Then she would take a nap lying
at the foot of her husband. During summer she would
fan him and during winter she would make fire to give
him heat. Early morning she would take him to a dis-
tant place for his excretion and after washing him would
seat him in a suitable place for cleaning his teeth and
face. Then the routine would start with great devotion
again.
<div n="NI"/>One day Sukanyā was returning from the river after her
bath and on the way she came across the Aśvinīdevas.
They were astounded to see such a beautiful damsel in
the forest and they accosted her and requested her to
select one of them as her husband. Knowing her identity
they advised her to forsake her old and blind husband and
come and live with one of them. She flew into a fury
when she heard her husband spoken of so slightingly
and by logical argument convinced them the error of
their request. Then they told her thus: “You are aware
we are the physicians of the devas. We can give back
eyesight to your husband and make him as beautiful
as one of us. We will then appear before you as three
lovely young men identical in appearance and then you
must select one among the three as your husband.”
<div n="NI"/>Sukanyā was immensely pleased as well as surprised to
hear the offer and was eager to see her husband young
and beautiful. But the last condition frightened her.
Anyhow she promised to give a reply after consulting her
husband and ran to the āśrama to tell her husband the
news. Cyavana advised her to accept the offer of the
Aśvinīdevas and Sukanyā ran back to the Aśvinīdevas
and brought them to her husband accepting their terms.
The Aśvinīdevas took the aged and blind Cyavana along
with them to the river nearby and the three plunged into
the river. When they rose up after a dip the three emer-
ged as young, lovely and charming triplets difficult to be
distinguished from one another. When Sukanyā stood
before the three to select her real husband she prayed to
her goddess and the Devī gave her the power to identify
Cyavana and so she correctly chose him from the three.
(Saptama Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Cyavana defeated Indra.%} Immensely pleased at re-
gaining his eyesight and youth Cyavana asked the Aśvinī-
devas what they wanted. The Aśvinīdevas replied that
Indra had banned wine to them and they would like to
have the ban lifted. Cyavana Maharṣi immediately
commenced a Somayāga to which were invited all the
devas and the Aśvinīdevas also. When Indra saw the
Aśvinīdevas standing to partake of the Soma wine he was
furious and objected to the wine being given to them.
Cyavana dissented and a fight ensued between Indra and
Cyavana. Indra raised his weapon ‘Vajrāyudha’ to
strike at Cyavana and then Cyavana made all his limbs
go stiff. He then raised from the sacrificial fire a fiendish
demon called Mada to kill the devas. All those present
were frightened by this demon and they ran away. But
Indra could not run for his limbs were stiff. Standing
there he prayed to his preceptor Bṛhaspati for help and
Bṛhaspati advised Indra to surrender to Cyavana. Indra
bowed his head before Cyavana and prayed to be ex-
cused. Cyavana was pleased and withdrawing the demon
tore him into four pieces and threw one each into Dice,
Hunting, Wine and Women. The devas and Aśvinīdevas
then went back to heaven. (Saptama Skandha, Devī
[Page191-a+ 64]
Bhāgavata. Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 17, Sūkta
116; Chapter 123, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Paraśurāma once came and stayed at the āśrama of
Cyavana. At that time Bhṛgu and Cyavana were in the
āśrama. They blessed him and advised him to go to
Kailāsa and do penance there to propitiate Śiva. It was
thus that Paraśurāma happened to go to Kailāsa to do
penance there. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 62).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Cyavana got a son named Pramati. This Pramati
was the father of Ruru and the grandfather of Śunaka.
(Chapter 5, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Cyavana married Āruṣi daughter of Manu. Aurva
was the son born to Āruṣi from her thigh. In descending
order from Aurva were born Ṛcīka—Jamadagni—
Paraśurāma. (Chapter 66, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Āstīka learnt Sāṅga Vedas from the āśrama
of Cyavana. (Chapter 48, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Cyavana was the guru of Bhīṣma. (Śloka 11,
Chapter 37, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) King Yuvanāśva once went to the āśrama of Cyavana
greatly worried over the lack of a descendant. Cyavana
prepared some sacred water made potent with the recital
of mantras to induce gestation and kept it there. Acci-
dentally the King drank that water and got pregnant.
The pregnancy developed without miscarriage and in due
time the King gave birth to a child, the left side of his
stomach bursting forth to push out the child. It was this
child who became Māndhātā. (Chapter 126, Vana
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Cyavana was a brilliant member of the court of
Brahmā. (Śloka 11, Chapter 22, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Cyavana went to Pātāla (nether-world). (See under
Kekaralohita).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Once the august Vedaśarmā of Kauśīkagotra went
to the āśrama of Cyavana lost in thought. Cyavana recei-
ved him with due respect and enquired about the reason
for his sorrow. Vedaśarmā then told him that the lack of a
son worried him much. Cyavana then blessed him and
assured him of a child soon. (Chapter 14, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(10) Cyavana had a daughter named Sumanas and she
was married to a sage called Somaśarmā. (Chapter 14,
Padma Purāṇa).
