AṄGA¦(M). The kingdom ruled by King Aṅga. Other
<div n="lb"/>details:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The Dynasty.%} The first King of the Aṅga dynasty
<div n="lb"/>was Aṅga the son of Bali. Anagābhu, Draviratha,
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaratha, Romapāda (Lomapāda), Caturaṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthulākṣa, Bṛhadratha, Bṛhanmanas, Jayadratha,
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya, Dṛḍhavrata, Satyakarmā, Atiratha, Karṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣasena and others were kings of this dynasty. Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>was the adopted son of Atiratha. During the period of
<div n="lb"/>the Mahābhārata, Kings of the Atiratha family were
<div n="lb"/>under the sway of the Candra vaṃśa (Lunar dynasty)
<div n="lb"/>kings such as Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. (For further in-
<div n="lb"/>formations see the word Atiratha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Karṇa became the king of Aṅga.%} A contest in
<div n="lb"/>archery and the wielding of other weapons was going
<div n="lb"/>on in Hastināpura, the competitors being the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>and the Pāṇḍavas. The status of Karṇa, who appeared
<div n="lb"/>on the side of the Kauravas, was questioned by the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas on the occasion and Duryodhana, who always
<div n="lb"/>stood on his dignity, anointed Karṇa as the King of
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga, on the spot. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 136).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Drought in the kingdom of Aṅga.%} Lomapāda (Roma-
<div n="lb"/>pāda) the king of Aṅga once deceived a hermit Brahmin.
<div n="lb"/>So all the Brahmins quitted the country and thereafter
<div n="lb"/>there was no rainfall in the country for several years.
<div n="lb"/>The sages of the country began to think on the means
<div n="lb"/>of bringing about rain. One day they approached the
<div n="lb"/>King and told him that the only way to get rain was
<div n="lb"/>to bring the great hermit Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to the country.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kaśyapa happened to see Urvaśī and he had
<div n="lb"/>seminal flow. The sperm fell in a river. A deer swal-
<div n="lb"/>lowed it along with the water it drank. It gave birth to a
<div n="lb"/>human child with horns on the head. This child was
<div n="lb"/>called Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. It was brought up by a hermit
<div n="lb"/>called Vibhāṇḍaka in his hut. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga had never
<div n="lb"/>seen women and by virtue of this, there occurred rain-
<div n="lb"/>fall wherever he went. The King Lomapāda sent some
<div n="lb"/>courtesans to the forest to attract Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, who
<div n="lb"/>following them arrived at the court of Lomapāda the
<div n="lb"/>King of Aṅga and the King gave Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, as a gift,
<div n="lb"/>his daughter Śāntā. Thus the country got rain. This
<div n="lb"/>Lomapāda was a friend of Daśaratha. (Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Parva, Chapters 110 to 113).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How the Kingdom got the name Aṅga.%} One opinion is
<div n="lb"/>that the Kingdom got its name from the King Aṅga
<div n="lb"/>who ruled over it. Another opinion is that the king got
<div n="lb"/>his name from the country he ruled. However there is
<div n="lb"/>a story revealing how the country came to be called
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga.
<div n="NI"/>In the realm of God, preliminary steps were being taken
<div n="lb"/>for making Śrī Parameśvara wed Pārvatī. According to
<div n="lb"/>the instructions of Devendra, Kāmadeva (the Lord of
<div n="lb"/>Love—Cupid) was trying to break the meditation of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and when Śiva opened his third eye, fire emitted from
<div n="lb"/>it and Anaṅga (Kāmadeva) was burned to ashes. It
<div n="lb"/>was in the country of Aṅga that the ashes of the ‘aṅga’
<div n="lb"/>(Body) of Kāmadeva fell and from that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>the country came to be called Aṅga and Kāmadeva,
<div n="lb"/>‘Anaṅga’ (without body). (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla-
<div n="lb"/>kāṇḍa, Sarga 26).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other informations.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) It is mentioned in the Hindi Dictionary, ‘Śabda
<div n="lb"/>Sāgara’ that the kingdom of Aṅga embracing Bhagatpur
[Page038-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and Muṃger in Bihar had its capital at Campāpurī and
<div n="lb"/>that the country had often stretched from Vaidya-
<div n="lb"/>nāthanāma to Bhuvaneśvar.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Arjuna had visited the Kingdom of Aṅga also during
<div n="lb"/>his pilgrimage. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 219, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>9).
<div n="NI"/>(3) The King of Aṅga was present at the sacrifice of
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya (Royal consecration) celebrated by Dharma-

<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 52, Stanza 16).
<div n="NI"/>(4) On one occasion Śrī Kṛṣṇa defeated the Aṅgas in a
<div n="lb"/>battle. (M.B., Droṇa Parva, Chapter 11, Stanza 15).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Paraśurāma had defeated the Aṅgas once. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva, Chapter 7, Stanza 12).
<div n="NI"/>(6) In the battle of Kurukṣetra between the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kauravas, on the sixteenth day of the battle,
<div n="lb"/>the heroes of Aṅga made an onslaught on Arjuna. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa Parva, Chapter 17, Stanza 12).
<div n="NI"/>(7) The Aṅgas attacked the armies of Dhṛṣṭadyumna
<div n="lb"/>and the King of Pāñcāla. (M.B., Karṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>22, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(8) A low caste man from Aṅga attacked Bhīma, who
<div n="lb"/>killed the man and his elephant. (Mahābhārata, Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 26, Stanzas 14 to 17).
