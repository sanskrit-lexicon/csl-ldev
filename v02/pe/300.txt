AṄGA¦(M). The kingdom ruled by King Aṅga. Other
details:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The Dynasty.%} The first King of the Aṅga dynasty
was Aṅga the son of Bali. Anagābhu, Draviratha,
Dharmaratha, Romapāda (Lomapāda), Caturaṅga,
Pṛthulākṣa, Bṛhadratha, Bṛhanmanas, Jayadratha,
Vijaya, Dṛḍhavrata, Satyakarmā, Atiratha, Karṇa,
Vṛṣasena and others were kings of this dynasty. Karṇa
was the adopted son of Atiratha. During the period of
the Mahābhārata, Kings of the Atiratha family were
under the sway of the Candra vaṃśa (Lunar dynasty)
kings such as Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. (For further in-
formations see the word Atiratha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Karṇa became the king of Aṅga.%} A contest in
archery and the wielding of other weapons was going
on in Hastināpura, the competitors being the Kauravas
and the Pāṇḍavas. The status of Karṇa, who appeared
on the side of the Kauravas, was questioned by the
Pāṇḍavas on the occasion and Duryodhana, who always
stood on his dignity, anointed Karṇa as the King of
Aṅga, on the spot. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 136).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Drought in the kingdom of Aṅga.%} Lomapāda (Roma-
pāda) the king of Aṅga once deceived a hermit Brahmin.
So all the Brahmins quitted the country and thereafter
there was no rainfall in the country for several years.
The sages of the country began to think on the means
of bringing about rain. One day they approached the
King and told him that the only way to get rain was
to bring the great hermit Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to the country.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kaśyapa happened to see Urvaśī and he had
seminal flow. The sperm fell in a river. A deer swal-
lowed it along with the water it drank. It gave birth to a
human child with horns on the head. This child was
called Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. It was brought up by a hermit
called Vibhāṇḍaka in his hut. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga had never
seen women and by virtue of this, there occurred rain-
fall wherever he went. The King Lomapāda sent some
courtesans to the forest to attract Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, who
following them arrived at the court of Lomapāda the
King of Aṅga and the King gave Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, as a gift,
his daughter Śāntā. Thus the country got rain. This
Lomapāda was a friend of Daśaratha. (Mahābhārata,
Araṇya Parva, Chapters 110 to 113).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How the Kingdom got the name Aṅga.%} One opinion is
that the Kingdom got its name from the King Aṅga
who ruled over it. Another opinion is that the king got
his name from the country he ruled. However there is
a story revealing how the country came to be called
Aṅga.
<div n="NI"/>In the realm of God, preliminary steps were being taken
for making Śrī Parameśvara wed Pārvatī. According to
the instructions of Devendra, Kāmadeva (the Lord of
Love—Cupid) was trying to break the meditation of Śiva
and when Śiva opened his third eye, fire emitted from
it and Anaṅga (Kāmadeva) was burned to ashes. It
was in the country of Aṅga that the ashes of the ‘aṅga’
(Body) of Kāmadeva fell and from that day onwards
the country came to be called Aṅga and Kāmadeva,
‘Anaṅga’ (without body). (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla-
kāṇḍa, Sarga 26).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other informations.%}
