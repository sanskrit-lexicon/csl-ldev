DATTĀTREYA¦. (DATTA). A hermit famous in the
<div n="lb"/>purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Anasūyā, the wife of hermit Atri gave birth
<div n="lb"/>to Dattātreya. But Dattātreya was the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa how Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu came to incarnate as Dattātreya.
<div n="NI"/>Once there was a hermit called Aṇimāṇḍavya (Māṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vya). While the hermit was engaged in silent medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation, some robbers passed by that way. The King's
<div n="lb"/>men who were chasing the robbers, came to the hermit
<div n="lb"/>and asked him about the robbers. The hermit did not
<div n="lb"/>break the silence. The King's men, thinking the hermit
<div n="lb"/>to be the thief bound his hands and legs and took him to
<div n="lb"/>the palace. The King ordered Māṇḍavya to be killed by
<div n="lb"/>piercing his body with a trident. Accordingly a trident
<div n="lb"/>was posted on a hill far away and Māṇḍavya was seated
[Page206-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>on the tip of it. Māṇḍavya lay there in agony.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that Śīlavatī, famous for her conjugal
<div n="lb"/>fidelity, went to the house of a harlot, carrying her
<div n="lb"/>husband Ugraśravas on her shoulder. When they passed
<div n="lb"/>by that way Ugraśravas scolded Aṇimāṇḍavya; getting
<div n="lb"/>angry at this Aṇimāṇḍavya cursed Ugraśravas that he
<div n="lb"/>would get his head broken and die before the sun-rise.
<div n="lb"/>Sīlavatī became very sorry when she heard the curse
<div n="lb"/>and she also cursed. “Let the sun not rise tomorrow”.
<div n="lb"/>The sun did not rise next day. Everything in the world
<div n="lb"/>was in chaos. The devas were flurried. They went to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Brahmā took them to Śiva. They could not
<div n="lb"/>find a solution. So all of them approached Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>The Trimūrtis (three gods) told the devas that the
<div n="lb"/>problem would be solved, and the devas returned.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara went to Śīlavatī. Before
<div n="lb"/>seeing Śīlavatī, they went to Anasūyā the wife of Atri
<div n="lb"/>and sought her help to persuade Śīlavatī to recall her
<div n="lb"/>curse. Thus Anasūyā and the Trimūrtis approached
<div n="lb"/>Śīlavatī and spoke compassionate and consolatory words.
<div n="lb"/>At last Śīlavatī recalled the curse. The Trimūrtis con-
<div n="lb"/>vinced Śīlavatī, that Ugraśravas would not die. The
<div n="lb"/>pleased Trimūrtis asked Anasūyā to ask for any boon. She
<div n="lb"/>replied that she did not want any boon except that the
<div n="lb"/>Trimūrtis should take birth as her sons. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu took birth as Dattātreya, Śiva as Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>and Brahmā as Candra, in the womb of Anasūyā. This
<div n="lb"/>is how Dattātreya was born.
<F>1. Dattātreya is known by the name ‘Datta’ also in the Purāṇas.</F> Dattātreya did penance
<div n="lb"/>from his childhood and became a hermit. (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapters 39 to 44).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kārtavīryārjuna and Dattātreya.%} When Kārtavīryār-
<div n="lb"/>juna became King Dattātreya had become very famous.
<div n="lb"/>Kārtavīryārjuna wanted to obtain supernatural powers.
<div n="lb"/>So he called the hermit Garga and asked for his advice.
<div n="lb"/>Garga advised him that Dattātreya was the incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu and that he would grant his wishes. So Kārta-
<div n="lb"/>vīryārjuna and his wife came to the river Narmadā,
<div n="lb"/>and taking bath in the river, began to worship Dattā-
<div n="lb"/>treya, who was doing penance closeby. Dattātreya
<div n="lb"/>was pleased and went to Kārtavīryārjuna and asked him
<div n="lb"/>what his desire was. He requested for thousand hands
<div n="lb"/>and to be a youth for ever, and such other things.
<div n="lb"/>Dattātreya granted his wishes. After that Kārtavīryār-
<div n="lb"/>juna would very often go to the hermit Dattātreya for
<div n="lb"/>his advice. (Brahma Purāṇa, Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Cursing Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa went to the hermit-
<div n="lb"/>age of Dattātreya. The hermit had placed a waterpot
<div n="lb"/>purified by reciting spells and incantations. Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>stole that waterpot. When the hermit knew this, he
<div n="lb"/>cursed Rāvaṇa saying, “Since the water, which was
<div n="lb"/>evoked by spells and incantations, has fallen on your
<div n="lb"/>head, Monkeys will pollute your head by treading on
<div n="lb"/>it.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Exhortation to the Sādhyas.%} Mention is made in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 36, Stanza 4, that the
<div n="lb"/>hermit Dattātreya gave exhortations to the Sādhyas (the
<div n="lb"/>sons of Dharmadeva by his wife Sādhyā).
<div n="NI"/>5) A boon for the birth of Nahuṣa. See Nahuṣa.
