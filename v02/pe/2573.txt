HANŪMĀN¦. A monkey born of the elements and
aspects of Devas. In the epics of no other country could
be found a character that belongs to the animal
kingdom who is as powerful, erudite and philosophic
as Hanūmān.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Many and different are the stories about
the birth of Hanūmān told in Purāṇic literature, and
they are briefly noted below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) The semen discharged by Śiva, whose erotic
feelings were excited by the sight of Viṣṇu disguised
as Mohinī was received by the Saptarṣis and deposited
in the womb of Añjanā, and Hanūmān was born out of
it. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudrasaṃhitā).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Daśaratha divided among his wives the divine
pāyasa (pudding) got from the putrakāmeṣṭi yajña
which was performed so that he might be blessed with
children. Somehow or other a kite snatched some
pudding and flew off with it. On its way the pudding
fell down from the beaks of the kite on the fingers of
Añjanā doing tapas in the forest. She ate that pudding
and Hanūmān was born as the son of Añjanā due
to the extraordinary powers of the pudding. (Ānan-
da Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Śiva, once in his fierce and effulgent form (aspect)
entered Kesarī, the husband of Añjanā and had coitus
[Page307-b+ 63]
with her. After that Vāyu (Wind-god) also had coitus
with her. Thus as a result of the sexual act by both
the Devas Añjanā got pregnant. Later, Añjanā was
about to throw into the valley of the mountain her
new-born child as it was an ugly one when Vāyu
(Wind god) intervened and saved the child. Hanūmān
was the child thus born of Śiva and Vāyu. (Bhaviṣya
Purāṇa, Pratisarga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Hanūṃān's actual father was Śiva. Gaṇapati
was born to Śiva and Pārvatī as they played in the
forest disguised as elephants. After that Śiva and
Pārvatī played about in the forest disguised as monkeys
as a result of which Pārvatī got pregnant. Since
Pārvatī did not like the idea of being the mother of a
monkey, Śiva, by his yogic power entrusted the child,
(in embryo) that was in the womb of Pārvatī to
Vāyu (Wind god), who carried it with him hither and
thither till it became mature, when it was deposited in
Añjanā, the monkey woman. The monkey called Kesarī
was her husband. Thus Hanūmān was born as the son
of Añjanā.
<div n="NI"/>Añjanā also has a story of her own. Once upon a time
she was the maid-servant called Puñjikasthalā of
Bṛhaspati. One day she went out to gather flowers
when the love-makings of other young women attracted
her so much that, without gathering flowers, and her
erotic sentiments being aroused much, she returned
home and covered Bṛhaspati with kisses. Bṛhaspati got
really angry with the misbehaviour of his maid-servant
and cursed her into a female monkey. She was told
that, after she had lived for sometime with a monkey-
husband she would get a child from the vitality of
Śiva, after which she would return to him as maid
servant as of old. And, accordingly, Puñjikasthalā
became a female monkey under the name Añjanā and
lived at Añjanā forest with a handsome monkey called
Kesarī as her husband.
<div n="NI"/>It was while Añjanā was doing tapas so that she might
become pregnant by Śiva that Śiva and Pārvatī played
in that forest disguised as monkeys, and Pārvatī
conceived and the child ultimately came out as the son
of Añjanā.
<div n="NI"/>Even while Añjanā was pregnant the child in her womb
had much to suffer at the hands of Bāli. Hearing from
Nārada that Śiva's son had been born in Añjanā's
womb Bāli feared that the actual birth of such a son
would jeopardise his lordship over the monkeys. To
ward off the threatened contingency, Bāli, as advised
by Nārada, let in the five metals (gold, copper, iron,
tin and zinc) in watery form into the stomach of
Añjanā. (This is a means of causing abortion). But,
the attempt misfired. Instead of the five metals killing
the child in Añjanā's womb, they became ear-orna-
ments for it, and Hanūmān was thus born with orna-
ments in his ears. (Kaṃba Rāmāyaṇa Pūrvakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Naming and boons.%} As soon as Hanūmān was born
Añjanā was released from the curse, and she wanted to
return to heaven. The monkey child asked its mother
what its future would be and how it was to earn its
living. She assured him that he would never be
destroyed and that fruits as ripe as the rising sun (she
pointed the sun out to him) would form his food. And,
Añjanā returned to heaven.
[Page308-a+ 65]
Thinking that the glowing and glittering Sun was food
for him to be eaten, the monkey child made just one
jump at it (Sun) and quite neared it. But seeing Rāhu,
bigger than the Sun he jumped at it. Then it was that
it saw Airāvata and it tried to eat it. And, seeing this
attempt of the monkey-child, Indra used his vajrāyudha
(Thunderbolt) against it. The weapon hit its chin and
wounded it, and in precarious condition it fell down
on earth. Vāyu (Wind god) who saw his child falling
down wounded carried it off to Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>When Vāyu (air) quitted the earth everything thereon
came to a dead-stop. Living things were on the verge
of death due to suffocation. And, then Brahmā and
others went to Pātāla, comforted Vāyu and congratu-
lated the monkey child. On the basis of Indra's vajra
having made a scar on its hanu (jaw-bone or chin) the
monkey child was named Hanūmān by the Devas, who,
one by one blessed him as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Brahmadeva; May you live long, so long as Brahmā
exists.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu: May you live all your life as the greatest
devotee of God.
<div n="NI"/>Indra: No weapon of any kind will wound or hit your
body.
<div n="NI"/>Agni: Fire will never affect you.
<div n="NI"/>Kāla: May not death ever court you.
<div n="NI"/>All the Devas: None will ever equal you in strength
and speed. Brahmā blessed Hanūmān again giving him
more physical power than Garuḍa and Vāyu blessed
him to have more speed than himself. (air). (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 15; Uttararāmāyaṇa;
Kambarāmāyaṇa, Pūrvakāṇḍa; Adbhutarāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Education.%} Being born of Śiva and on account of
the Śivaśakti in him, Hanūmān reached boyhood
immediately. To learn the four Vedas and the six
śāstras he chose Sūrya mentally as his preceptor, and
approached him with the request to be taught the
Vedas etc. Sūrya agreed to have Hanūmān as his dis-
ciple subject to the condition that the latter would not
be permitted to sit with the Bālakhilyas in his (Sūrya's)
chariot and study. Hanūmān agreed to the condition
to learn from Sūrya walking in front of him. With
book opened in his hand and concentrating all his atten-
tion on the face of Sūrya Hanūmān traversed the sky
and within a short period of sixty hours he mastered all
the Vedas and the śāstras thoroughly well. Though
Sūrya said that he would consider the great interest
Hanūmān took in his studies as dakṣiṇā (tuition fee)
Hanūmān wanted Sūrya to accept something more by
way of dakṣiṇā, and Sūrya said as follows:—“If you
are so very particular about offering me something
more as dakṣiṇā I shall tell you. My son Sugrīva is
living on earth with Bāli and he is not as strong and
powerful as Bāli. You be of help to Sugrīva as his
minister and constant companion.”
<div n="NI"/>Happy at Sūrya's words Hanūmān returned to the
forest and lived as Sugrīva's minister for the rest of his
life.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śrī Rāma's servant.%} From the day he met Śrī Rāma
after the abduction of Sītā by Rāvaṇa till Rāma's death
his story is inextricably connected with that of Rāma.
(See under Rāma).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%His music.%} Once in a musical competition Hanū-
mān defeated Nārada. (Adbhutarāmāyaṇa; also see
Para 8 under Nārada).
[Page308-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Śivaliṅga at Rāmeśvaram.%} There is a story in the
Yuddhakāṇḍa of Rāmāyaṇa connecting Hanūmān with
the Śivaliṅga installed in the temple at Rāmeśvaram.
(See under Rāmeśvaram).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Lost his divine power.%} Once due to a curse of sage
Tṛṇabindu Hanūmān lost his great strength and vita-
lity. But, he would regain the lost power when one
reminded him of it. During the search for Sītā Hanu-
mān felt it difficult to jump across the southern sea to
Laṅkā due to the above curse. But, when Jāmbavān
described to him about his noble origin and powers
Hanūmān regained his lost power and vitality, and
successfully jumped across the sea to Laṅkā. (See
Tṛṇabindu II, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%A fort made of tail.%} He made a fort of his tail and
saved Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa within it. (See Pātāla-
rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Hanūmān and Sahasramukha Rāvaṇa.%} (See Sahasra-
mukha Rāvaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Hanūmān and Śatrughna.%} Śatrughna, who conducted
the horse in connection with the Aśvamedha performed
by Śrī Rāma after his return from exile in the forest,
fell down unconscious in his fight with King Vīramaṇi,
and then Hanūmān brought a herbal medicine called
‘Droṇa’ from the Himālayas and with its aid brought
back Śatrughna to consciousness. (Padma Purāṇa,
Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Taken captive by Kuśa and Lava.%} The Yajñāśva
(sacrificial horse) of the Aśvamedha yajña of Śrī Rāma
led by a contingent of Rāma's army was resting in a
tent put up near the hermitage of Gautama when Kuśa
and Lava together captured the horse. Hanūmān, who
rushed over to the spot on receiving intimation of the
news was bound hand and foot with creepers by Kuśa
and Lava and dragged to the hermitage. Sītā, was then
in the hermitage brooding over the past, and the re-
petition of the word ‘Rāma’ by the humiliated Hanūmān
awoke her from her reverie. She was taken aback to
see Hanūmān there in that plight and got him released
from captivity by her sons. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
Uttarakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Old age.%} Having witnessed Rāmāvatāra (incar-
nation of Rāma) to its very end, Hanūmān, who had
by now become quite old, spent his days guarding the
Kadalī forest. Bhīma, who happened to go there to
collect Saugandhika flowers got defeated in fight by
Hanūmān. (See Bhīma, Para 7).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Arjuna's flag-Symbol%} (See under Arjuna 17B).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Idols of Hanūmān.%} When an idol of Hanūmān is
installed in a temple, he must be represented as holding
Vajra in one hand and his feet must seem to tear the
ground under them. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 51).
