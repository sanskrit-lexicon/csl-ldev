HANŪMĀN¦. A monkey born of the elements and
<div n="lb"/>aspects of Devas. In the epics of no other country could
<div n="lb"/>be found a character that belongs to the animal
<div n="lb"/>kingdom who is as powerful, erudite and philosophic
<div n="lb"/>as Hanūmān.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Many and different are the stories about
<div n="lb"/>the birth of Hanūmān told in Purāṇic literature, and
<div n="lb"/>they are briefly noted below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) The semen discharged by Śiva, whose erotic
<div n="lb"/>feelings were excited by the sight of Viṣṇu disguised
<div n="lb"/>as Mohinī was received by the Saptarṣis and deposited
<div n="lb"/>in the womb of Añjanā, and Hanūmān was born out of
<div n="lb"/>it. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudrasaṃhitā).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Daśaratha divided among his wives the divine
<div n="lb"/>pāyasa (pudding) got from the putrakāmeṣṭi yajña
<div n="lb"/>which was performed so that he might be blessed with
<div n="lb"/>children. Somehow or other a kite snatched some
<div n="lb"/>pudding and flew off with it. On its way the pudding
<div n="lb"/>fell down from the beaks of the kite on the fingers of
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā doing tapas in the forest. She ate that pudding
<div n="lb"/>and Hanūmān was born as the son of Añjanā due
<div n="lb"/>to the extraordinary powers of the pudding. (Ānan-
<div n="lb"/>da Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Śiva, once in his fierce and effulgent form (aspect)
<div n="lb"/>entered Kesarī, the husband of Añjanā and had coitus
[Page307-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>with her. After that Vāyu (Wind-god) also had coitus
<div n="lb"/>with her. Thus as a result of the sexual act by both
<div n="lb"/>the Devas Añjanā got pregnant. Later, Añjanā was
<div n="lb"/>about to throw into the valley of the mountain her
<div n="lb"/>new-born child as it was an ugly one when Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>(Wind god) intervened and saved the child. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>was the child thus born of Śiva and Vāyu. (Bhaviṣya
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Pratisarga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Hanūṃān's actual father was Śiva. Gaṇapati
<div n="lb"/>was born to Śiva and Pārvatī as they played in the
<div n="lb"/>forest disguised as elephants. After that Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī played about in the forest disguised as monkeys
<div n="lb"/>as a result of which Pārvatī got pregnant. Since
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī did not like the idea of being the mother of a
<div n="lb"/>monkey, Śiva, by his yogic power entrusted the child,
<div n="lb"/>(in embryo) that was in the womb of Pārvatī to
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu (Wind god), who carried it with him hither and
<div n="lb"/>thither till it became mature, when it was deposited in
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā, the monkey woman. The monkey called Kesarī
<div n="lb"/>was her husband. Thus Hanūmān was born as the son
<div n="lb"/>of Añjanā.
<div n="NI"/>Añjanā also has a story of her own. Once upon a time
<div n="lb"/>she was the maid-servant called Puñjikasthalā of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati. One day she went out to gather flowers
<div n="lb"/>when the love-makings of other young women attracted
<div n="lb"/>her so much that, without gathering flowers, and her
<div n="lb"/>erotic sentiments being aroused much, she returned
<div n="lb"/>home and covered Bṛhaspati with kisses. Bṛhaspati got
<div n="lb"/>really angry with the misbehaviour of his maid-servant
<div n="lb"/>and cursed her into a female monkey. She was told
<div n="lb"/>that, after she had lived for sometime with a monkey-
<div n="lb"/>husband she would get a child from the vitality of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, after which she would return to him as maid
<div n="lb"/>servant as of old. And, accordingly, Puñjikasthalā
<div n="lb"/>became a female monkey under the name Añjanā and
<div n="lb"/>lived at Añjanā forest with a handsome monkey called
<div n="lb"/>Kesarī as her husband.
<div n="NI"/>It was while Añjanā was doing tapas so that she might
<div n="lb"/>become pregnant by Śiva that Śiva and Pārvatī played
<div n="lb"/>in that forest disguised as monkeys, and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>conceived and the child ultimately came out as the son
<div n="lb"/>of Añjanā.
<div n="NI"/>Even while Añjanā was pregnant the child in her womb
<div n="lb"/>had much to suffer at the hands of Bāli. Hearing from
<div n="lb"/>Nārada that Śiva's son had been born in Añjanā's
<div n="lb"/>womb Bāli feared that the actual birth of such a son
<div n="lb"/>would jeopardise his lordship over the monkeys. To
<div n="lb"/>ward off the threatened contingency, Bāli, as advised
<div n="lb"/>by Nārada, let in the five metals (gold, copper, iron,
<div n="lb"/>tin and zinc) in watery form into the stomach of
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā. (This is a means of causing abortion). But,
<div n="lb"/>the attempt misfired. Instead of the five metals killing
<div n="lb"/>the child in Añjanā's womb, they became ear-orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments for it, and Hanūmān was thus born with orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments in his ears. (Kaṃba Rāmāyaṇa Pūrvakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Naming and boons.%} As soon as Hanūmān was born
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā was released from the curse, and she wanted to
<div n="lb"/>return to heaven. The monkey child asked its mother
<div n="lb"/>what its future would be and how it was to earn its
<div n="lb"/>living. She assured him that he would never be
<div n="lb"/>destroyed and that fruits as ripe as the rising sun (she
<div n="lb"/>pointed the sun out to him) would form his food. And,
<div n="lb"/>Añjanā returned to heaven.
[Page308-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Thinking that the glowing and glittering Sun was food
<div n="lb"/>for him to be eaten, the monkey child made just one
<div n="lb"/>jump at it (Sun) and quite neared it. But seeing Rāhu,
<div n="lb"/>bigger than the Sun he jumped at it. Then it was that
<div n="lb"/>it saw Airāvata and it tried to eat it. And, seeing this
<div n="lb"/>attempt of the monkey-child, Indra used his vajrāyudha
<div n="lb"/>(Thunderbolt) against it. The weapon hit its chin and
<div n="lb"/>wounded it, and in precarious condition it fell down
<div n="lb"/>on earth. Vāyu (Wind god) who saw his child falling
<div n="lb"/>down wounded carried it off to Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>When Vāyu (air) quitted the earth everything thereon
<div n="lb"/>came to a dead-stop. Living things were on the verge
<div n="lb"/>of death due to suffocation. And, then Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>others went to Pātāla, comforted Vāyu and congratu-
<div n="lb"/>lated the monkey child. On the basis of Indra's vajra
<div n="lb"/>having made a scar on its hanu (jaw-bone or chin) the
<div n="lb"/>monkey child was named Hanūmān by the Devas, who,
<div n="lb"/>one by one blessed him as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Brahmadeva; May you live long, so long as Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>exists.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu: May you live all your life as the greatest
<div n="lb"/>devotee of God.
<div n="NI"/>Indra: No weapon of any kind will wound or hit your
<div n="lb"/>body.
<div n="NI"/>Agni: Fire will never affect you.
<div n="NI"/>Kāla: May not death ever court you.
<div n="NI"/>All the Devas: None will ever equal you in strength
<div n="lb"/>and speed. Brahmā blessed Hanūmān again giving him
<div n="lb"/>more physical power than Garuḍa and Vāyu blessed
<div n="lb"/>him to have more speed than himself. (air). (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 15; Uttararāmāyaṇa;
<div n="lb"/>Kambarāmāyaṇa, Pūrvakāṇḍa; Adbhutarāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Education.%} Being born of Śiva and on account of
<div n="lb"/>the Śivaśakti in him, Hanūmān reached boyhood
<div n="lb"/>immediately. To learn the four Vedas and the six
<div n="lb"/>śāstras he chose Sūrya mentally as his preceptor, and
<div n="lb"/>approached him with the request to be taught the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas etc. Sūrya agreed to have Hanūmān as his dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciple subject to the condition that the latter would not
<div n="lb"/>be permitted to sit with the Bālakhilyas in his (Sūrya's)
<div n="lb"/>chariot and study. Hanūmān agreed to the condition
<div n="lb"/>to learn from Sūrya walking in front of him. With
<div n="lb"/>book opened in his hand and concentrating all his atten-
<div n="lb"/>tion on the face of Sūrya Hanūmān traversed the sky
<div n="lb"/>and within a short period of sixty hours he mastered all
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and the śāstras thoroughly well. Though
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya said that he would consider the great interest
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān took in his studies as dakṣiṇā (tuition fee)
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān wanted Sūrya to accept something more by
<div n="lb"/>way of dakṣiṇā, and Sūrya said as follows:—“If you
<div n="lb"/>are so very particular about offering me something
<div n="lb"/>more as dakṣiṇā I shall tell you. My son Sugrīva is
<div n="lb"/>living on earth with Bāli and he is not as strong and
<div n="lb"/>powerful as Bāli. You be of help to Sugrīva as his
<div n="lb"/>minister and constant companion.”
<div n="NI"/>Happy at Sūrya's words Hanūmān returned to the
<div n="lb"/>forest and lived as Sugrīva's minister for the rest of his
<div n="lb"/>life.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śrī Rāma's servant.%} From the day he met Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>after the abduction of Sītā by Rāvaṇa till Rāma's death
<div n="lb"/>his story is inextricably connected with that of Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Rāma).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%His music.%} Once in a musical competition Hanū-
<div n="lb"/>mān defeated Nārada. (Adbhutarāmāyaṇa; also see
<div n="lb"/>Para 8 under Nārada).
[Page308-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Śivaliṅga at Rāmeśvaram.%} There is a story in the
<div n="lb"/>Yuddhakāṇḍa of Rāmāyaṇa connecting Hanūmān with
<div n="lb"/>the Śivaliṅga installed in the temple at Rāmeśvaram.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Rāmeśvaram).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Lost his divine power.%} Once due to a curse of sage
<div n="lb"/>Tṛṇabindu Hanūmān lost his great strength and vita-
<div n="lb"/>lity. But, he would regain the lost power when one
<div n="lb"/>reminded him of it. During the search for Sītā Hanu-
<div n="lb"/>mān felt it difficult to jump across the southern sea to
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā due to the above curse. But, when Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>described to him about his noble origin and powers
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān regained his lost power and vitality, and
<div n="lb"/>successfully jumped across the sea to Laṅkā. (See
<div n="lb"/>Tṛṇabindu II, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%A fort made of tail.%} He made a fort of his tail and
<div n="lb"/>saved Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa within it. (See Pātāla-
<div n="lb"/>rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Hanūmān and Sahasramukha Rāvaṇa.%} (See Sahasra-
<div n="lb"/>mukha Rāvaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Hanūmān and Śatrughna.%} Śatrughna, who conducted
<div n="lb"/>the horse in connection with the Aśvamedha performed
<div n="lb"/>by Śrī Rāma after his return from exile in the forest,
<div n="lb"/>fell down unconscious in his fight with King Vīramaṇi,
<div n="lb"/>and then Hanūmān brought a herbal medicine called
<div n="lb"/>‘Droṇa’ from the Himālayas and with its aid brought
<div n="lb"/>back Śatrughna to consciousness. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Taken captive by Kuśa and Lava.%} The Yajñāśva
<div n="lb"/>(sacrificial horse) of the Aśvamedha yajña of Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>led by a contingent of Rāma's army was resting in a
<div n="lb"/>tent put up near the hermitage of Gautama when Kuśa
<div n="lb"/>and Lava together captured the horse. Hanūmān, who
<div n="lb"/>rushed over to the spot on receiving intimation of the
<div n="lb"/>news was bound hand and foot with creepers by Kuśa
<div n="lb"/>and Lava and dragged to the hermitage. Sītā, was then
<div n="lb"/>in the hermitage brooding over the past, and the re-
<div n="lb"/>petition of the word ‘Rāma’ by the humiliated Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>awoke her from her reverie. She was taken aback to
<div n="lb"/>see Hanūmān there in that plight and got him released
<div n="lb"/>from captivity by her sons. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Uttarakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Old age.%} Having witnessed Rāmāvatāra (incar-
<div n="lb"/>nation of Rāma) to its very end, Hanūmān, who had
<div n="lb"/>by now become quite old, spent his days guarding the
<div n="lb"/>Kadalī forest. Bhīma, who happened to go there to
<div n="lb"/>collect Saugandhika flowers got defeated in fight by
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān. (See Bhīma, Para 7).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Arjuna's flag-Symbol%} (See under Arjuna 17B).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Idols of Hanūmān.%} When an idol of Hanūmān is
<div n="lb"/>installed in a temple, he must be represented as holding
<div n="lb"/>Vajra in one hand and his feet must seem to tear the
<div n="lb"/>ground under them. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 51).
