DEVADYUTI¦. A Ṛṣi who dwelt in his āśrama on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of river Śarasvatī. Owing to the blessing of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>a son called Sumitra was born to him. As a result of his
<div n="lb"/>doing rigorous tapas for 1000 years he shone with a
<div n="lb"/>rare effulgence. Though Viṣṇu appeared to him one
<div n="lb"/>day in the month of Vaiśākha and asked him to choose
<div n="lb"/>any boon he wanted, he, who was so much detached in
<div n="lb"/>life prayed only for devotion to God. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 212).
