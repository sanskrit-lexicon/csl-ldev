DEVADYUTI¦. A Ṛṣi who dwelt in his āśrama on the
banks of river Śarasvatī. Owing to the blessing of Viṣṇu
a son called Sumitra was born to him. As a result of his
doing rigorous tapas for 1000 years he shone with a
rare effulgence. Though Viṣṇu appeared to him one
day in the month of Vaiśākha and asked him to choose
any boon he wanted, he, who was so much detached in
life prayed only for devotion to God. (Padma Purāṇa,
Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 212).
