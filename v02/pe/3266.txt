KAPĀLĪ II¦. Śiva. The Mahābhārata gives the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing story regarding the reason for Śiva's getting the
<div n="lb"/>name of Kapālī.
<div n="NI"/>Once a great controversy arose regarding the supreme
<div n="lb"/>sovereignty of the three worlds between Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. Then there came to their midst an effulgence
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva and a voice from heaven said “He who finds
<div n="lb"/>the source of this brilliance is the real sovereign of the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds”. Brahmā went up to find the upper end
<div n="lb"/>and Viṣṇu went down to find the lower end. They
<div n="lb"/>travelled for a very long time without finding the end
<div n="lb"/>when Brahmā saw a Ketakī flower coming down. On
<div n="lb"/>enquiry the flower said it was coming from the origin
<div n="lb"/>of the brilliance and that three Brahmā deluges had
<div n="lb"/>elapsed since its starting from there. Brahmā took that
<div n="lb"/>flower and went to Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu asked Brahmā whether
<div n="lb"/>he had seen the end of the effulgence and Brahmā said
<div n="lb"/>‘yes’. Immediately the flower in the hand of Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>turned into the figure of Śiva and cut off one of the
<div n="lb"/>heads of Brahmā making five-headed Brahmā into four-
<div n="lb"/>headed. The angered Brahmā cursed Śiva “May you
<div n="lb"/>go begging with a Kapāla (human skull) in your hand.”
<div n="lb"/>Thus Śiva became a Kapālī. Śiva cursed Brahmā back
<div n="lb"/>saying “You will not be worshipped by anyone” (See
<div n="lb"/>under Śiva, Brahmā).
