NACIKETAS¦. A famous hermit. Kaṭhopaniṣad is the
<div n="lb"/>exhortation given by Yamadeva (God of death) to this
<div n="lb"/>hermit. There is a story to substantiate this statement.
<div n="lb"/>The father of Naciketas was the hermit Vājaśravas.
<div n="lb"/>This hermit gave as alms, cows which had grown lean
<div n="lb"/>by old age and lack of food, at the time of sacrifices.
<div n="lb"/>Naciketas felt grieved at this action of his father. He
<div n="lb"/>went to his father and sadly asked him “Father, to whom
<div n="lb"/>are you going to give me?” The father got angry at the
[Page513-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>question of the son, and replied; “You are to be given
<div n="lb"/>to Yama.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing these cruel words of his father, the boy went
<div n="lb"/>to the palace of Yama who had been away. For three
<div n="lb"/>days and nights the boy waited there without food and
<div n="lb"/>drink. When Yama returned the boy was happy and
<div n="lb"/>cheerful and Yama was pleased with him. Yama pro-
<div n="lb"/>mised the boy three boons and asked him what boon he
<div n="lb"/>wanted. The first boon he asked for was, “Give me the
<div n="lb"/>boon that father will be pleased with me and not angry
<div n="lb"/>with me.” The second was, “Advise me how to attain
<div n="lb"/>heaven.” The third was, “Tell me the solution of the
<div n="lb"/>mystery, whether the soul remains after death.” Yama
<div n="lb"/>granted the first two boons and said to him, “Boy, this
<div n="lb"/>is a difficult question. So ask for another boon such as
<div n="lb"/>long life, power over the world, all the pleasures of the
<div n="lb"/>world and so on.”
<div n="NI"/>The boy replied: “The things you have promised to
<div n="lb"/>give me are useless things because after a while the
<div n="lb"/>organs of sense will become fragile. The life also will
<div n="lb"/>end. So, please tell me. I want the answer to my
<div n="lb"/>question.” Being greatly pleased at the reply of the boy
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadeva expounded to him about the immortality
<div n="lb"/>of the soul and the essence of things regarding God
<div n="lb"/>Almighty. (Kaṭhopaniṣad).
