NACIKETAS¦. A famous hermit. Kaṭhopaniṣad is the
exhortation given by Yamadeva (God of death) to this
hermit. There is a story to substantiate this statement.
The father of Naciketas was the hermit Vājaśravas.
This hermit gave as alms, cows which had grown lean
by old age and lack of food, at the time of sacrifices.
Naciketas felt grieved at this action of his father. He
went to his father and sadly asked him “Father, to whom
are you going to give me?” The father got angry at the
[Page513-a+ 65]
question of the son, and replied; “You are to be given
to Yama.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing these cruel words of his father, the boy went
to the palace of Yama who had been away. For three
days and nights the boy waited there without food and
drink. When Yama returned the boy was happy and
cheerful and Yama was pleased with him. Yama pro-
mised the boy three boons and asked him what boon he
wanted. The first boon he asked for was, “Give me the
boon that father will be pleased with me and not angry
with me.” The second was, “Advise me how to attain
heaven.” The third was, “Tell me the solution of the
mystery, whether the soul remains after death.” Yama
granted the first two boons and said to him, “Boy, this
is a difficult question. So ask for another boon such as
long life, power over the world, all the pleasures of the
world and so on.”
<div n="NI"/>The boy replied: “The things you have promised to
give me are useless things because after a while the
organs of sense will become fragile. The life also will
end. So, please tell me. I want the answer to my
question.” Being greatly pleased at the reply of the boy
Dharmadeva expounded to him about the immortality
of the soul and the essence of things regarding God
Almighty. (Kaṭhopaniṣad).
