ALARKA II¦. A king of the states of Kāśī and Karūṣa.
<div n="lb"/>He was a very honest man. Forsaking all riches and his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom he accepted Dharmamārga. (Śloka 64, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 115, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.). He was a member of
[Page027-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the council of yama. He attained salvation by yoga and
<div n="lb"/>meditation. (18th Śloka, Chapter 8, Sabhā Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Once Alarka decided to overcome the five senses. To
<div n="lb"/>control them he sent arrows at the mind, nose, tongue,
<div n="lb"/>ear, eye, skin and intelligence. But the senses never
<div n="lb"/>surrendered to them. Then Alarka by sheer dhyāna
<div n="lb"/>and yoga brought them under control. (M.B., Anu-
<div n="lb"/>śāsana Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>Alarka once told a blind brahmin boy to ask for any boon
<div n="lb"/>from him. The boy demanded the eyes of Alarka. To
<div n="lb"/>keep his promise Alarka scooped out his eyes and gave
<div n="lb"/>them to the blind boy. (Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 12, Śloka 43).
