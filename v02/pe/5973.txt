ŚAKTIBHADRA¦. A dramatist in Sanskrit, who lived
in the seventh century A.D. He belonged to Cheng-
annur in the Kerala State. He was a disciple of
Śaṅkarācārya. The Dramatic composition ‘Āścarya-
cūḍāmaṇi’ is his work.
<div n="NI"/>Śaktibhadra, after writing his drama, once read it out
to Śaṅkarācārya. As the ācārya was observing silence
that day, he made no comments about the drama.
Disappointed at this silence of his Guru, the drama-
tist burnt his work to ashes in fire. When his observ-
ance of silence was over, the Guru asked his disciple
for the drama. When told about the burning of the
drama the ācārya repeated from memory the whole
drama. The above legend is widely prevalent in
Kerala.
