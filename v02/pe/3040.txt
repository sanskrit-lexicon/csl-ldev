KACA¦. The first son of Bṛhaspati. That extremely
beautiful boy was a great favourite of the devas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
Brahmā—Aṅgiras—Bṛhaspati—Kaca.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he studied the secret of Mṛtasañjīvanī.%} The
Devas and Asuras always quarrelled with each other.
Devas accepted Bṛhaspati as their guru and the asuras
made Śukrācārya their guru. Śukrācārya knew an art
which Bṛhaspati did not know, the secret of Mṛtasañ-
jīvanī. When the devas cut the Asuras to pieces,
Śukrācārya used to bring them back to life by his
knowledge of Mṛtasañjīvanī. Mṛtasañjīvanī is the art of
reviving the dead.
<div n="NI"/>Devas were at a loss to know what to do. They wanted
to learn the secret of Mṛtasañjīvanī from Śukrācārya
somehow. It was imperative that they should learn it.
Then they found out a way. They sent Kaca, son of
Bṛhaspati, to Śukrācārya.
<div n="NI"/>Kaca went to Śukrācārya and told him that he was
the son of Bṛhaspati and had come to him to be his
disciple for a period of a thousand years doing service
to him. The modesty of the boy appealed to Śukrācārya
and he accepted Kaca as his disciple.
<div n="NI"/>Devayānī, daughter of Śukrācārya, fell in love with
Kaca. They were always together as an inseparable
couple. Asuras did not like the advent of Kaca to the
Āśrama of Śukrācārya. They knew that he had come
to study the secrets of the Asuras. Once Kaca went
alone to look after the cows and the Asuras followed
him stealthily. When Kaca entered deep into the
forest the Asuras killed him and gave him to the
wolves.
<div n="NI"/>It became dusk. The cows returned to the Āśrama
without the cowherd. Devayānī waited for a long
time for Kaca to come. Not seeing him Devayānī went
weeping to her father and said, “Oh, father, the sun
has set. You have performed your nightly fire sacrifice.
The cattle have come back by themselves and still
Kaca has not returned home. I fear he is dead or has
been killed. I cannot live without him.”
<div n="NI"/>The affectionate Śukrācārya could not bear the sight
of his dear daughter weeping and so he went to the
forest with Devayānī and employing the art of
Sañjīvanī he invoked the dead youth to appear. At
[Page362-b+ 65]
once Kaca came back to life and stood before them.
All the three then returned to the āśrama happily.
<div n="NI"/>The anger of the Asuras against Kaca knew no bounds.
On another occasion the Asuras seized him and after
killing him pounded his body into a paste and mixed
it up in sea-water. This time also, at the request of
Devayānī, Śukrācārya brought him back to life.
<div n="NI"/>The third time the Asuras burnt the body of Kaca and
mixed the ashes in wine and served it to Śukrācārya to
drink. The disciple thus went inside the belly of the
guru. Dusk came, the cattle came and still Kaca did
not return and Devayānī reported the matter to her
father. Śukrācārya sat for some time in meditation and
then he knew that Kaca was in his own stomach. If he
got Kaca out, he would burst his stomach and Śukra
would die and if he did not get him out his daughter
would burst her heart and die. Śukrācārya was in a fix.
He asked Kaca how he got in and he replied that it
was through the wine. Śukra imparted to Kaca the
art of Mṛtasañjīvanī and Kaca lying within the stomach
repeated it. Then Śukrācārya called Kaca by name
and Kaca came out bursting the stomach of his guru.
The preceptor lay dead and by employing the art of
Mṛtasañjīvanī he had learnt, Kaca brought his guru
to life. Śukrācārya eschewed wine from that day
onwards and declared it as a forbidden drink to
brahmins. Śukrācārya said that because Kaca was
reborn from his stomach he must be deemed his son.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaca was cursed.%} Kaca remained for some more
time under the tutelage of Śukrācārya and when his
education became complete he took leave of his
preceptor and also Devayānī. Devayānī followed him
for a long distance from the hermitage and requested
him to marry her. Kaca replied he could not do so
because he had become a brother to Devayānī.
Devayānī got angry and cursed him saying that he
would not be able to use the art of Mṛtasañjīvanī he
had learnt from her father. Kaca cursed her back
saying that none of the sons of sages would marry her.
Kaca however felt relieved that though he would not
be able to practise the art, his disciples would be able
to do so. He went back to Devaloka and was heartily
welcomed by all the Devas. He then imparted the art
of Mṛtasañjīvanī to the devas. (Chapters 76 and 77,
Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kaca visits Bhīṣma.%} Kaca was also one among the
several people who visited Bhīṣma while the latter was
lying on a bed of arrows awaiting death. (Śloka 9,
Chapter 47, Śānti Parva, M.B.).
