KACA¦. The first son of Bṛhaspati. That extremely
<div n="lb"/>beautiful boy was a great favourite of the devas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Aṅgiras—Bṛhaspati—Kaca.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he studied the secret of Mṛtasañjīvanī.%} The
<div n="lb"/>Devas and Asuras always quarrelled with each other.
<div n="lb"/>Devas accepted Bṛhaspati as their guru and the asuras
<div n="lb"/>made Śukrācārya their guru. Śukrācārya knew an art
<div n="lb"/>which Bṛhaspati did not know, the secret of Mṛtasañ-
<div n="lb"/>jīvanī. When the devas cut the Asuras to pieces,
<div n="lb"/>Śukrācārya used to bring them back to life by his
<div n="lb"/>knowledge of Mṛtasañjīvanī. Mṛtasañjīvanī is the art of
<div n="lb"/>reviving the dead.
<div n="NI"/>Devas were at a loss to know what to do. They wanted
<div n="lb"/>to learn the secret of Mṛtasañjīvanī from Śukrācārya
<div n="lb"/>somehow. It was imperative that they should learn it.
<div n="lb"/>Then they found out a way. They sent Kaca, son of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati, to Śukrācārya.
<div n="NI"/>Kaca went to Śukrācārya and told him that he was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Bṛhaspati and had come to him to be his
<div n="lb"/>disciple for a period of a thousand years doing service
<div n="lb"/>to him. The modesty of the boy appealed to Śukrācārya
<div n="lb"/>and he accepted Kaca as his disciple.
<div n="NI"/>Devayānī, daughter of Śukrācārya, fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>Kaca. They were always together as an inseparable
<div n="lb"/>couple. Asuras did not like the advent of Kaca to the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama of Śukrācārya. They knew that he had come
<div n="lb"/>to study the secrets of the Asuras. Once Kaca went
<div n="lb"/>alone to look after the cows and the Asuras followed
<div n="lb"/>him stealthily. When Kaca entered deep into the
<div n="lb"/>forest the Asuras killed him and gave him to the
<div n="lb"/>wolves.
<div n="NI"/>It became dusk. The cows returned to the Āśrama
<div n="lb"/>without the cowherd. Devayānī waited for a long
<div n="lb"/>time for Kaca to come. Not seeing him Devayānī went
<div n="lb"/>weeping to her father and said, “Oh, father, the sun
<div n="lb"/>has set. You have performed your nightly fire sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>The cattle have come back by themselves and still
<div n="lb"/>Kaca has not returned home. I fear he is dead or has
<div n="lb"/>been killed. I cannot live without him.”
<div n="NI"/>The affectionate Śukrācārya could not bear the sight
<div n="lb"/>of his dear daughter weeping and so he went to the
<div n="lb"/>forest with Devayānī and employing the art of
<div n="lb"/>Sañjīvanī he invoked the dead youth to appear. At
[Page362-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>once Kaca came back to life and stood before them.
<div n="lb"/>All the three then returned to the āśrama happily.
<div n="NI"/>The anger of the Asuras against Kaca knew no bounds.
<div n="lb"/>On another occasion the Asuras seized him and after
<div n="lb"/>killing him pounded his body into a paste and mixed
<div n="lb"/>it up in sea-water. This time also, at the request of
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī, Śukrācārya brought him back to life.
<div n="NI"/>The third time the Asuras burnt the body of Kaca and
<div n="lb"/>mixed the ashes in wine and served it to Śukrācārya to
<div n="lb"/>drink. The disciple thus went inside the belly of the
<div n="lb"/>guru. Dusk came, the cattle came and still Kaca did
<div n="lb"/>not return and Devayānī reported the matter to her
<div n="lb"/>father. Śukrācārya sat for some time in meditation and
<div n="lb"/>then he knew that Kaca was in his own stomach. If he
<div n="lb"/>got Kaca out, he would burst his stomach and Śukra
<div n="lb"/>would die and if he did not get him out his daughter
<div n="lb"/>would burst her heart and die. Śukrācārya was in a fix.
<div n="lb"/>He asked Kaca how he got in and he replied that it
<div n="lb"/>was through the wine. Śukra imparted to Kaca the
<div n="lb"/>art of Mṛtasañjīvanī and Kaca lying within the stomach
<div n="lb"/>repeated it. Then Śukrācārya called Kaca by name
<div n="lb"/>and Kaca came out bursting the stomach of his guru.
<div n="lb"/>The preceptor lay dead and by employing the art of
<div n="lb"/>Mṛtasañjīvanī he had learnt, Kaca brought his guru
<div n="lb"/>to life. Śukrācārya eschewed wine from that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards and declared it as a forbidden drink to
<div n="lb"/>brahmins. Śukrācārya said that because Kaca was
<div n="lb"/>reborn from his stomach he must be deemed his son.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaca was cursed.%} Kaca remained for some more
<div n="lb"/>time under the tutelage of Śukrācārya and when his
<div n="lb"/>education became complete he took leave of his
<div n="lb"/>preceptor and also Devayānī. Devayānī followed him
<div n="lb"/>for a long distance from the hermitage and requested
<div n="lb"/>him to marry her. Kaca replied he could not do so
<div n="lb"/>because he had become a brother to Devayānī.
<div n="lb"/>Devayānī got angry and cursed him saying that he
<div n="lb"/>would not be able to use the art of Mṛtasañjīvanī he
<div n="lb"/>had learnt from her father. Kaca cursed her back
<div n="lb"/>saying that none of the sons of sages would marry her.
<div n="lb"/>Kaca however felt relieved that though he would not
<div n="lb"/>be able to practise the art, his disciples would be able
<div n="lb"/>to do so. He went back to Devaloka and was heartily
<div n="lb"/>welcomed by all the Devas. He then imparted the art
<div n="lb"/>of Mṛtasañjīvanī to the devas. (Chapters 76 and 77,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kaca visits Bhīṣma.%} Kaca was also one among the
<div n="lb"/>several people who visited Bhīṣma while the latter was
<div n="lb"/>lying on a bed of arrows awaiting death. (Śloka 9,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 47, Śānti Parva, M.B.).
