AKṢAYAPĀTRA¦. This is a copper vessel given to
Dharmaputra by Sūrya (Sun). To destroy the Pāṇḍavas,
Duryodhana kept them in a palace made of lac. They
escaped from there and passing through dense forests
crossed the river Ganges and reached the Kingdom of
Pāñcāla where they married the King's daughter,
Kṛṣṇā (Pāñcālī). On their way they killed two demons
called Hidimba and Baka. When they were living hap-
pily at Indraprastha the jealous Duryodhana defeated
them in a game of dice by foul play and sent them for a
period of twelve years to the forests. The Pāṇḍavas
found it impossible to feed the innumerable subjects who
[Page023-b+ 65]
faithfully followed them to the forest. Dharmaputra
then prayed to the God, Sūrya and he appeared before
him and gave him this Akṣaya Pātra (Akṣaya=never
getting empty, Pātra=pot). Everyday this pot never
got empty till the meals of Pāñcālī were over. (Chapter
3, Vana Parva, M.B.). See also under Duryodhana,
Para 12.
