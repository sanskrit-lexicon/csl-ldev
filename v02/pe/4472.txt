MĀYĀ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A consort of Mahāviṣṇu, Māyā
<div n="lb"/>has got a very prominent place in Hindu Purāṇas. The
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas state that this whole universe is unreal, illusory
<div n="lb"/>and if we feel it real it is because of the working of this
<div n="lb"/>Māyā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} How was Māyā born? Agni Purāṇa in its
<div n="lb"/>twentieth chapter gives a genealogy of Māyā. Hiṃsā
<div n="lb"/>(injury) is the wife of Adharma (evil). They got two
<div n="lb"/>children named Anṛta (falsehood) and Nikṛti (wicked-
<div n="lb"/>ness). From them were born Bhaya (fear), Naraka (hell)
<div n="lb"/>Māyā (illusion) and Vedanā (pain). Māyā in turn gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to Death, the destroyer of all pain produced from
<div n="lb"/>Hate or Misery. Mṛtyu (death) produced Vyādhi
<div n="lb"/>(disease), Jarā (rugosity), Śoka (sorrow), Tṛṣṇā (desire)
<div n="lb"/>and Krodha (anger).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Exhibition of Māyā.%} Mahāviṣṇu once told Nārada thus:
<div n="lb"/>“There is nothing like living beings on earth. All is an
<div n="lb"/>illusion due to Māyā.” Nārada requested Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>to show him that and Viṣṇu took Nārada to the banks
<div n="lb"/>of a river and exhibited the wonderful working of
<div n="lb"/>Māyā. (For details see under Tāladhvaja I).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Gāthi, a brahmin, saw Māyā.%} In the country
<div n="lb"/>of Kosala there was once a brahmin named Gāthi.
<div n="lb"/>He went to the forests and standing there in water in
<div n="lb"/>a pond, immersed up to his neck, started doing penance.
<div n="lb"/>For eight months he did penance thus and then Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu appeared before him and asked him what boon
[Page496-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>he wanted. The brahmin said he wanted to see Māyā-
<div n="lb"/>devī. Viṣṇu granted the boon and disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>Several years passed after that and nothing happened.
<div n="lb"/>One day the brahmin as usual went to bathe in a pond.
<div n="lb"/>When he took a dip in the waters he forgot all his
<div n="lb"/>prayers and mantras. There was a change of mind. He
<div n="lb"/>felt he was lying dead in his house. Relatives were
<div n="lb"/>sitting around weeping. His wife was in tears and was
<div n="lb"/>holding his legs. In an atmosphere of mourning, his own
<div n="lb"/>people weeping bitterly carried his body to a frightening
<div n="lb"/>burial ground and put it on a funeral pyre. It was burnt
<div n="lb"/>to ashes. He then felt himself in the womb af a Caṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>woman living in a village near Hūṇamaṇḍala. The
<div n="lb"/>foetus developed and a black boy was born. The boy
<div n="lb"/>grew passing the stages of infancy, childhood and boy-
<div n="lb"/>hood and became a man, black and stout. He started
<div n="lb"/>enjoying sexual life with a beautiful caṇḍāla girl. The
<div n="lb"/>amorous plays were done on leaf-beds, in creeper-huts,
<div n="lb"/>bushes and in caves and soon many evil-natured sons
<div n="lb"/>were born to him. Gradually his health faded and he
<div n="lb"/>constructed a hermitage and lived there as a hermit.
<div n="lb"/>His children grew up and he became old and then all
<div n="lb"/>on a sudden all his children and wife and other
<div n="lb"/>members of his family died and he was left alone. He
<div n="lb"/>then left the place and travelling much reached the
<div n="lb"/>capital city of Kīramaṇḍala. The city gates were deco-
<div n="lb"/>rated and inside people stood in groups. The road to
<div n="lb"/>the palace from the gate had been beautified and as he
<div n="lb"/>reached the palace gates he saw an elephant as big and
<div n="lb"/>black as mountain standing there well caparisoned. It
<div n="lb"/>was customary in those days to post an elephant well
<div n="lb"/>bedecked before the palace gates when a King died.
<div n="lb"/>The elephant he saw was one who had been let loose
<div n="lb"/>to select a new King in the place of the one who had
<div n="lb"/>just died. The elephant on seeing him took him by its
<div n="lb"/>trunk and placed him on its back. The people when
<div n="lb"/>they saw it shouted “The King”, “The King”. Drums
<div n="lb"/>were beaten and people shouted with joy. He was
<div n="lb"/>taken to the palace where he was received by young
<div n="lb"/>and beautiful girls. He was dressed in royal robes and
<div n="lb"/>he took over the administration of the state. Gradually
<div n="lb"/>he accepted as his wives the wives of the former King
<div n="lb"/>and lived there accepting the name of Gālava. He
<div n="lb"/>ruled the state to the satisfaction of all for eight
<div n="lb"/>years. One day the King went out for a stroll dressed
<div n="lb"/>as an ordinary man. Just outside the gate of the palace
<div n="lb"/>a set of Caṇḍālas were sitting singing songs to the
<div n="lb"/>accompaniment of a violin. As soon as they saw Gālava
<div n="lb"/>one of the Caṇḍālas, a red-eyed old man, got up from
<div n="lb"/>the group and addressing the King as “Hi, Kalañju”
<div n="lb"/>shouted loudly, “Friend, where had you been all this
<div n="lb"/>time? It is a long time since we saw you. It is our luck
<div n="lb"/>we saw you at least now”. The King of Kīra did not
<div n="lb"/>like the words of the Caṇḍāla and he rebuked the old
<div n="lb"/>man. The queens and others standing on the terrace of
<div n="lb"/>the palace could see this scene. They were shocked. They
<div n="lb"/>regretted they had all along been serving a Caṇḍāla.
<div n="lb"/>The news spread like wild fire in the state. The King
<div n="lb"/>had to live in the palace without the help and co-oper-
<div n="lb"/>ation of anybody inside or outside the palace.
<div n="NI"/>People wanted to atone for the crime they had commit-
<div n="lb"/>ted in installing a Caṇḍāla as their King. They made
<div n="lb"/>small firepits throughout the country and started
<div n="lb"/>committing suicide by jumping into it. The King
[Page496-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>lamented that such a mass suicide was due to him and
<div n="lb"/>he also made a fire-pit and jumped into it.
<div n="NI"/>The heat of the fire-pit woke him from his day-dream
<div n="lb"/>and Gāthi found himself in the pond where he had
<div n="lb"/>come to bathe. “What! Who am I? What all roles did
<div n="lb"/>I take just now?” These puzzling thoughts filled him
<div n="lb"/>and he went back to the āśrama and started life as
<div n="lb"/>usual. One day an old friend of his came to the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>and after the daily routine they lay down to sleep.
<div n="lb"/>During their conversation Gāthī asked his friend why
<div n="lb"/>he had become fleshless and so lean. Then his friend
<div n="lb"/>narrated a story exactly similar to the experiences
<div n="lb"/>which Gāthi had in the country of Kīra. He added
<div n="lb"/>that to atone for the sin of his association with the
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍālas he was conducting Prayāgasnāna (bath in
<div n="lb"/>Prayāga), Japa and Cāndrāyaṇamahāvrata. All those
<div n="lb"/>things he explained, made him lean.
<div n="NI"/>Gāthi knew that the story of the guest related to him
<div n="lb"/>and he was eager to visit the country of Kīra. When he
<div n="lb"/>went to Kīra he saw everything there in the same way
<div n="lb"/>as in his dream. Then he realised that it was an ex-
<div n="lb"/>hibition by Viṣṇu of the working of Māyā. Gāthi then
<div n="lb"/>renounced everything and went into a cave and started
<div n="lb"/>doing penance there. After some years Mahā Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and blessed him. (Jñānavāsiṣṭha).
