MĀYĀ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A consort of Mahāviṣṇu, Māyā
has got a very prominent place in Hindu Purāṇas. The
Purāṇas state that this whole universe is unreal, illusory
and if we feel it real it is because of the working of this
Māyā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} How was Māyā born? Agni Purāṇa in its
twentieth chapter gives a genealogy of Māyā. Hiṃsā
(injury) is the wife of Adharma (evil). They got two
children named Anṛta (falsehood) and Nikṛti (wicked-
ness). From them were born Bhaya (fear), Naraka (hell)
Māyā (illusion) and Vedanā (pain). Māyā in turn gave
birth to Death, the destroyer of all pain produced from
Hate or Misery. Mṛtyu (death) produced Vyādhi
(disease), Jarā (rugosity), Śoka (sorrow), Tṛṣṇā (desire)
and Krodha (anger).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Exhibition of Māyā.%} Mahāviṣṇu once told Nārada thus:
“There is nothing like living beings on earth. All is an
illusion due to Māyā.” Nārada requested Mahāviṣṇu
to show him that and Viṣṇu took Nārada to the banks
of a river and exhibited the wonderful working of
Māyā. (For details see under Tāladhvaja I).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Gāthi, a brahmin, saw Māyā.%} In the country
of Kosala there was once a brahmin named Gāthi.
He went to the forests and standing there in water in
a pond, immersed up to his neck, started doing penance.
For eight months he did penance thus and then Mahā-
viṣṇu appeared before him and asked him what boon
[Page496-a+ 64]
he wanted. The brahmin said he wanted to see Māyā-
devī. Viṣṇu granted the boon and disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>Several years passed after that and nothing happened.
One day the brahmin as usual went to bathe in a pond.
When he took a dip in the waters he forgot all his
prayers and mantras. There was a change of mind. He
felt he was lying dead in his house. Relatives were
sitting around weeping. His wife was in tears and was
holding his legs. In an atmosphere of mourning, his own
people weeping bitterly carried his body to a frightening
burial ground and put it on a funeral pyre. It was burnt
to ashes. He then felt himself in the womb af a Caṇḍāla
woman living in a village near Hūṇamaṇḍala. The
foetus developed and a black boy was born. The boy
grew passing the stages of infancy, childhood and boy-
hood and became a man, black and stout. He started
enjoying sexual life with a beautiful caṇḍāla girl. The
amorous plays were done on leaf-beds, in creeper-huts,
bushes and in caves and soon many evil-natured sons
were born to him. Gradually his health faded and he
constructed a hermitage and lived there as a hermit.
His children grew up and he became old and then all
on a sudden all his children and wife and other
members of his family died and he was left alone. He
then left the place and travelling much reached the
capital city of Kīramaṇḍala. The city gates were deco-
rated and inside people stood in groups. The road to
the palace from the gate had been beautified and as he
reached the palace gates he saw an elephant as big and
black as mountain standing there well caparisoned. It
was customary in those days to post an elephant well
bedecked before the palace gates when a King died.
The elephant he saw was one who had been let loose
to select a new King in the place of the one who had
just died. The elephant on seeing him took him by its
trunk and placed him on its back. The people when
they saw it shouted “The King”, “The King”. Drums
were beaten and people shouted with joy. He was
taken to the palace where he was received by young
and beautiful girls. He was dressed in royal robes and
he took over the administration of the state. Gradually
he accepted as his wives the wives of the former King
and lived there accepting the name of Gālava. He
ruled the state to the satisfaction of all for eight
years. One day the King went out for a stroll dressed
as an ordinary man. Just outside the gate of the palace
a set of Caṇḍālas were sitting singing songs to the
accompaniment of a violin. As soon as they saw Gālava
one of the Caṇḍālas, a red-eyed old man, got up from
the group and addressing the King as “Hi, Kalañju”
shouted loudly, “Friend, where had you been all this
time? It is a long time since we saw you. It is our luck
we saw you at least now”. The King of Kīra did not
like the words of the Caṇḍāla and he rebuked the old
man. The queens and others standing on the terrace of
the palace could see this scene. They were shocked. They
regretted they had all along been serving a Caṇḍāla.
The news spread like wild fire in the state. The King
had to live in the palace without the help and co-oper-
ation of anybody inside or outside the palace.
<div n="NI"/>People wanted to atone for the crime they had commit-
ted in installing a Caṇḍāla as their King. They made
small firepits throughout the country and started
committing suicide by jumping into it. The King
[Page496-b+ 65]
lamented that such a mass suicide was due to him and
he also made a fire-pit and jumped into it.
<div n="NI"/>The heat of the fire-pit woke him from his day-dream
and Gāthi found himself in the pond where he had
come to bathe. “What! Who am I? What all roles did
I take just now?” These puzzling thoughts filled him
and he went back to the āśrama and started life as
usual. One day an old friend of his came to the āśrama
and after the daily routine they lay down to sleep.
During their conversation Gāthī asked his friend why
he had become fleshless and so lean. Then his friend
narrated a story exactly similar to the experiences
which Gāthi had in the country of Kīra. He added
that to atone for the sin of his association with the
Caṇḍālas he was conducting Prayāgasnāna (bath in
Prayāga), Japa and Cāndrāyaṇamahāvrata. All those
things he explained, made him lean.
<div n="NI"/>Gāthi knew that the story of the guest related to him
and he was eager to visit the country of Kīra. When he
went to Kīra he saw everything there in the same way
as in his dream. Then he realised that it was an ex-
hibition by Viṣṇu of the working of Māyā. Gāthi then
renounced everything and went into a cave and started
doing penance there. After some years Mahā Viṣṇu
appeared before him and blessed him. (Jñānavāsiṣṭha).
