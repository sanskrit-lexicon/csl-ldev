VIJAYA¦ XII. A bow of Indra. This is as bright as
<div n="lb"/>Gāṇḍīva and as strong as the bow Śārṅgadhanus of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The bows of the Devas, considered to be
<div n="lb"/>most divine, are Vijaya, Gāṇḍīva and Śārṅga. Vijaya
<div n="lb"/>belongs to Indra, Gāṇḍīva to Varuṇa and Śārṅga to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. Once Druma, a Kimpuruṣa (demi god) who lived
<div n="lb"/>in the mountain Gandhamādana got Vijaya from Indra.
<div n="lb"/>After that Rukmī, his disciple got this bow from Druma.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 158, Stanza 3).
