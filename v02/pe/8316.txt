VIJAYA¦ XII. A bow of Indra. This is as bright as
Gāṇḍīva and as strong as the bow Śārṅgadhanus of
Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The bows of the Devas, considered to be
most divine, are Vijaya, Gāṇḍīva and Śārṅga. Vijaya
belongs to Indra, Gāṇḍīva to Varuṇa and Śārṅga to
Viṣṇu. Once Druma, a Kimpuruṣa (demi god) who lived
in the mountain Gandhamādana got Vijaya from Indra.
After that Rukmī, his disciple got this bow from Druma.
(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 158, Stanza 3).
