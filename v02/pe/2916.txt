JĀTISMARAKĪṬA¦. A worm which got emancipation
through the advice of Vyāsa. Once while Vyāsa was
roaming about in the country, by chance he saw this
worm. It was running through the road, seeing a cart
coming very fast. Vyāsa stopped it and asked, “What
are you running from?” The worm replied that he
was running in fear that the wheel of the cart coming
from behind might crush him. In the previous birth
this worm was a Śūdra. Jealousy, resentment, arrogance,
selfishness etc. were the traits of his character in his
previous life. Only twice in his life had he done good
[Page352-a+ 65]
deeds. Once he honoured his mother and on another
occasion he respected a Brāhmaṇa. Because of these
two good deeds, in his present life as worm he had
the remembrance of his previous life. Vyāsa gave the
worm necessary advice. Instantly the worm was crushed
under the wheel of the cart.
<div n="NI"/>In the next rebirth this Jātismarakīṭa was born as a
Kṣatriya King. As he was leading the life of a powerful
King he met with Vyāsa. He received advice from the
hermit. In his next life he became a Brāhmaṇa and
finally he attained bliss. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, 3
Chapters from 117).
