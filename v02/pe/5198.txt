PIPPALĀDA¦. An ancient sage belonging to the tradi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of preceptors. (See under Guruparamparā). It is
<div n="lb"/>said that this sage got that name because he was in the
<div n="lb"/>habit of eating Pippalī in large quantities daily.
<div n="lb"/>Praśnopaniṣad tells a story of how the sages Sukeśa,
<div n="lb"/>Śaibya, Satyakāma (Kaśyapa), Kauśalya, Bhārgava and
<div n="lb"/>Kabandhī went to Pippalāda seeking Ātmajñāna
<div n="lb"/>(spiritual knowledge) and how he gave them instruct-
<div n="lb"/>ions on the same.
<div n="NI"/>Padma Purāṇa gives the following information regard-
<div n="lb"/>ing Pippalāda:—“Once Kuṇḍala, a brahmin residing
<div n="lb"/>in Kurukṣetra, got a son named Sukarmā. Sukarmā's
<div n="lb"/>parents were old and Sukarmā spent most of his time
<div n="lb"/>looking after his sickly aged parents. Kuṇḍala taught
<div n="lb"/>his son all the Vedas and Śāstras. At that time in the
<div n="lb"/>gotra of Kaśyapa was born a brahmin named Pippa-
<div n="lb"/>lāda. Controlling his senses and abandoning all
<div n="lb"/>passions he did severe penance in a forest called
<div n="lb"/>Daśāraṇya. The greatness of his penance made the
<div n="lb"/>animals of the forest leave their mutual enmity and live
<div n="lb"/>in perfect peace. Even the devas were astonished at
<div n="lb"/>the power of his penance.
<div n="NI"/>Pippalāda did penance sitting as majestic and motion-
<div n="lb"/>less as a mountain for a thousand years. Ants made a
<div n="lb"/>sand-heap over him like a mole-hill. The sage sat
<div n="lb"/>inside without any motion; poisonous black cobras
<div n="lb"/>circled round him and yet the sage made no movement.
<div n="lb"/>Three thousand years went by like that and then the
<div n="lb"/>devas showered flowers on him. Brahmā appeared and
<div n="lb"/>gave him the boon ‘Sarvakāmasiddhi’ (getting all that
<div n="lb"/>is desired) and by the blessing of Brahmā he became a
<div n="lb"/>very learned person also.
<div n="NI"/>Pippalāda became arrogant with the boon of ‘Sarva-
<div n="lb"/>kāmasiddhi’ in his possession. One day while he was
<div n="lb"/>sitting on a river-bank a swan appeared before him
<div n="lb"/>and in clear tones said:—“Pippalāda, why are you so
<div n="lb"/>proud of your greatness? I do not believe you have that
[Page590-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>power of universal attraction. This art is arvācīna
<div n="lb"/>(modern); you do not know Prācīna because
<div n="lb"/>you are illiterate. You take pride unnecessarily
<div n="lb"/>for having done penance for three thousand years. Do
<div n="lb"/>you know Sukarmā, the wise son of Kuṇḍala? He is
<div n="lb"/>the man who has acquired this power of attraction.
<div n="lb"/>There is no mahājñanī (one possessing spiritual know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge) like him anywhere else in this world. Sukarmā
<div n="lb"/>has given no gifts, he has not practised meditation, he
<div n="lb"/>has not performed yāgas or yajñas nor has he ever done
<div n="lb"/>a pilgrimage. He has not done any of these virtuous
<div n="lb"/>deeds and yet he is well-versed in all the śāstras and
<div n="lb"/>Vedas. Even though he is a child you do not possess
<div n="lb"/>enough knowledge to equal his. Why? Because he is
<div n="lb"/>always engaged in the care and welfare of his parents.
<div n="lb"/>You take pride in your achievements without reason.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that Pippalāda went and met Sukarmā. Pip-
<div n="lb"/>palāda knew that the bird was none other than Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>himself. They talked to each other for a long time and
<div n="lb"/>then Pippalāda admitted that Sukarmā was a greater
<div n="lb"/>man than himself. (Chapters 60-62, Padma Purāṇa).
