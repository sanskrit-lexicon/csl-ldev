GṚHASTHA¦. In ancient India the life of a male person
<div n="lb"/>was divided into four stages, namely, Brahmacarya
<div n="lb"/>Gārhasthya, Vānaprastha and Sannyāsa. He who is in
<div n="lb"/>the second stage of life is called a Gṛhastha.
<div n="NI"/>When a person marries, he becomes a Gṛhastha. The
<div n="lb"/>bride should have certain qualities to be an ideal wife.
<div n="lb"/>The girl should be only a third of the age of the male.
<div n="lb"/>She should not have hair either too much or too little.
<div n="lb"/>She should not be black or of a piṅgala hue. She
<div n="lb"/>should not have any of her organs extra at the time of
<div n="lb"/>birth. The following types of girls are to be avoided
<div n="lb"/>for marriage. (1) Girls bred up by low-caste people
<div n="lb"/>(2) girls with hair over the body (3) not born of a
<div n="lb"/>good family (4) sick ones (5) ill-natured ones (6) girls
<div n="lb"/>who use abusive language (7) with hereditary diseases
<div n="lb"/>(8) with śmaśru (hair on the face) (9) girls with mascu-
<div n="lb"/>line features (10) with the sound of males (11) lean
<div n="lb"/>ones (12) with the voice of a crow (13) with thick eye-
<div n="lb"/>lashes (14) round eyes. Again avoid girls having hair
<div n="lb"/>on their legs, raised heels and those with small depre-
<div n="lb"/>ssions on their cheeks when they laugh. Girls whose
<div n="lb"/>bodies are too bright, with white nails, red eyes and
<div n="lb"/>fat hands and legs are not good for marriage. Girls too
<div n="lb"/>tall or too short, with eyelashes touching each other,
<div n="lb"/>with broad and raised teeth are to be avoided. A true
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhastha is one who marries a girl who is separated
<div n="lb"/>from him by five generations on the maternal side and
<div n="lb"/>seven generations on the paternal side.
<div n="NI"/>A true Gṛhastha should daily worship devas, cows,
<div n="lb"/>brahmins, scholars, old men and preceptors. He should
<div n="lb"/>worship sandhyā (dawn and dusk) daily and also fire.
<div n="lb"/>He should wear on his body leaves of Viṣṇukrānti,
<div n="lb"/>Karuka (couch grass), Tulasī (holy basil plant). He
<div n="lb"/>should appear neat and smart wearing good dress, with
<div n="lb"/>white flowers on his well combed head. He should
<div n="lb"/>never steal, speak unpleasant words to anybody nor
<div n="lb"/>speak an untruth even if it be pleasant. He should not
<div n="lb"/>openly speak about the sins of others. He should not
<div n="lb"/>covet another man's wife. He should not travel in a
<div n="lb"/>damaged vehicle nor should he sit under the shade of
<div n="lb"/>a tree on the banks of a river. A Gṛhastha should not
<div n="lb"/>mingle with such persons as (1) men hated by the
<div n="lb"/>people (2) outcastes from society (3) insane men (4)
<div n="lb"/>those having a great number of enemies (5) those who
<div n="lb"/>torment others (6) prostitutes (7) husbands of prosti-
<div n="lb"/>tutes (8) those who use abusive language (9) those
<div n="lb"/>who tell lies (10) spendthrifts (11) scandalmongers and
<div n="lb"/>(12) rogues. Never travel alone. He should not bathe
<div n="lb"/>against the flow in a river. Never enter a house on fire
<div n="lb"/>nor climb to the extreme top of trees. He should not
<div n="lb"/>grind his teeth, squeeze out his nose, yawn without
<div n="lb"/>covering the mouth. breathe or spit, with the face
<div n="lb"/>covered, laugh noisily, breathe out with a sound, bite
[Page301-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>the teeth, pinch grasses or write or draw on the ground
<div n="lb"/>(Aṃśa 3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
