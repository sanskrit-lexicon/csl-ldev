DHARMA¦. A deva who is the abode of all luxuries in
<div n="lb"/>life.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This deva broke the right nipple of Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>came out in the form of a human being. Three sons
<div n="lb"/>were born to him: Śama, Kāma and Harṣa. Kāma
<div n="lb"/>married Rati, Śama, Prāpti and Harṣa, Nandā.

<div n="lb"/>Niḥsṛṭo bhagavān dharmaḥ sarvalokasukhāvahaḥ //
<div n="lb"/>Trayastasyavarāḥ putrāḥ sarvabhūtamanoharāḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Śamaḥ Kāmaśca Harṣaśca tejasā lokadhāriṇaḥ //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 65).</F>
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage and family life.%} The Bhāgavata states that
<div n="lb"/>Dharma married the thirteen daughters of Daksaprajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati named Śraddhā, Maitrī, Dayā, Śānti, Puṣṭi, Tuṣṭi,
<div n="lb"/>Kriyā, Unnati, Buddhi, Medhā, Titikṣā, Hṛī and Mūrti.
<div n="lb"/>Besides them he married ten other girls named Bhānu,
<div n="lb"/>Lambā, Kukubh, Jāmi, Viśvā, Sādhyā, Marutvatī,
<div n="lb"/>Vasu, Muhūrtā and Saṅkalpā and also a woman named
<div n="lb"/>Sunṛtā. According to Mahābhārata Dharma married
<div n="lb"/>the following daughters of Dakṣa: Kīrti, Lakṣmī, Dhṛti,
<div n="lb"/>Medhā, Puṣṭi, Śraddhā, Kriyā, Buddhi and Lajjā.
<div n="NI"/>From each of his wives there originated a family. The
<div n="lb"/>son born to each is given below Śraddhā—Śubha;
<div n="lb"/>Maitrī—Prasāda; Dayā—Abhaya; Śānti—Sukha; Tuṣṭi—
<div n="lb"/>Moda; Unnati—Darpa; Buddhi—Artha; Medhā—
<div n="lb"/>Sukṛti; Titikṣā—Śama; Hrī—Praśraya. Mūrti gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to the virtuous Naranārāyaṇas. Sunṛtā became the
<div n="lb"/>mother of the devas, Satyavrata and Satyasena.
<div n="lb"/>Satyasena became famous by slaying many cruel and
<div n="lb"/>evil-natured Yakṣas, demons and spirits. Lambā gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to Ṛṣabha and Vidyotana. Ṛṣabha got a son,
<div n="lb"/>Indrasena. Vidyotana became the father of stanayitnu.
<div n="lb"/>Kukubh delivered Saṅkaṭa and Saṅkaṭa became the
<div n="lb"/>father of Kīkaṭa and Durgadeva. Jāmi got a son Svarga
<div n="lb"/>and of him was born Nandī. Viśvā gave birth to Viśva-
[Page224-b+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>devas and Sādhyā to Sādhyas. These Sādhyas are different
<div n="lb"/>from those born of Brahmā. Sādhyas became the father of
<div n="lb"/>Arthasiddhi. Marutvatī gave birth to Marutvat and
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta. Vasu gave birth to eight sons and they were
<div n="lb"/>known as Aṣṭavasus. Droṇa, the first of the Aṣṭavasus,
<div n="lb"/>married Abhimati. Abhimati is known as Dharā also.
<div n="lb"/>It was Droṇa and Dharā who were born as Nandagopa
<div n="lb"/>and Yaśodā later. Prāṇa, second of the Aṣṭavasus,
<div n="lb"/>married Ūrjasvatī, daughter of Priyavrata. (Navama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Prominent sons.%} Four sons of Dharma, Hari, Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Nara and Nārāyaṇa became prominent. Hari and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa were great yogis while Nara and Nārāyaṇa were
<div n="lb"/>great ascetics. (See under Naranārāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The daughter named Dharmavratā.%} Dharmadeva got a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Dharmavratā of his wife Dharmavatī.
<div n="lb"/>Dharmavratā was an ascetic and she was married to
<div n="lb"/>Marīci, son of Brahmā. One day Marīci came back
<div n="lb"/>from the forest after getting darbha and flowers extre-
<div n="lb"/>mely tired and so after food lay down to rest. His wife
<div n="lb"/>sitting by his side massaged his legs. The sage fell as-
<div n="lb"/>leep. Then Brahmā came there and Dharmavratā
<div n="lb"/>attended on him and worshipped him. Marīci, when he
<div n="lb"/>woke up, finding Dharmavratā attending on another
<div n="lb"/>man cursed her and made her into stone. Dharmavratā
<div n="lb"/>pleaded not guilty and standing inside a fire-pit did pen-
<div n="lb"/>ance for ten thousand years. Brahmā and other devas
<div n="lb"/>appeared before her and consoled her by assuring that
<div n="lb"/>though she would be a stone devas would take their
<div n="lb"/>abode in it and that she would be worshipped by all.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards that stone was known as Devaśilā
<div n="lb"/>and even now it is believed that Brahmā and other
<div n="lb"/>devas live therein. (Chapter 114, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Dharma was cursed and made Vidura by Aṇimāṇḍavya.%} (See
<div n="lb"/>Aṇimāṇḍavyā).
<div n="NI"/>{%Other details.%} (1) A portion of Dharma took life as Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira in Kuntī. (See Dharmaputra).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dharma did penance in Dharmatīrtha for a very
<div n="lb"/>long time. (Śloka 1, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) The abode of Dharma was Dharmaprastha. (Śloka 1,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Dharma did penance on the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Vaitaraṇī for a long time. (Śloka 4, Chapter 114, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) While the Pānḍavas were in exile in the forest
<div n="lb"/>Dharma in the form of a deer came to the hut of a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin and carried away by its horns the Araṇi stick
<div n="lb"/>which the Brahmin owned for making fire by attrition.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 311, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Dharma appeared in the form of a Yakṣa and made
<div n="lb"/>all the Pāṇḍavas swoon except Yudhiṣṭhira, on the
<div n="lb"/>shores of a pond in the forest and later got them back
<div n="lb"/>to normal. (See under Dharmaputra).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Dharmadeva went to Viśvāmitra in the guise of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha to test him. (See para 3 of Gālava).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Following a directive from Brahmā, Dharmadeva
<div n="lb"/>once brought before Varuṇa all the daityadānavas bound
<div n="lb"/>by ropes. (Chapter 128, Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Mahāviṣṇu was born as a son of Dharmadeva. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Naranārāyaṇa).
[Page225-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(10) Dharma worshipped a brahmin named Satya tak-
<div n="lb"/>ing the form of a deer. (Śloka 17, Chapter 272, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Dharma tested Sudarśana taking the form of a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin. (Śloka 79, Chapter 2, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Dharma saved a sage named Vatsanābha from a
<div n="lb"/>great downpour taking the shape of a buffalo. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>12, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(13) Dharma disguised as a brahmin, went and impart-
<div n="lb"/>ed advice to Janaka, father of Sītā. (Chapter 32, Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(14) To test Jamadagni, Dharma went to his āśrama
<div n="lb"/>taking the form of Anger. Jamadagni had just milked
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenu and kept the milk in a pot. Dharma as
<div n="lb"/>Anger crept into the milk. Jamadagni drank it and yet
<div n="lb"/>remained calm. Seeing this Dharma appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him in the form of a Brahmin and blessed him assuring
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni that in future he would be obedient to
<div n="lb"/>Dharma (Chapter 91, Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(15) When at the fag end of their life the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>started on their Mahāprasthāna, Dharma as a dog
<div n="lb"/>accompanied them up to the gates of heaven. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>22, Chapter 5, Svargārohaṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Dharma and Kāla.%} There is a misunderstanding found
<div n="lb"/>even in some Purāṇas that Kāla, the chief of Kālapurī,
<div n="lb"/>and Dharma are one and the same person. But if the
<div n="lb"/>stories around each are examined it is easy to deduce
<div n="lb"/>that they are two different devas. The father and
<div n="lb"/>mother of Dharmadeva is Brahmā. The father of Kāla
<div n="lb"/>is Sūrya and mother Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśvakarmā.
<div n="lb"/>This itself is a sufficient evidence to show that the two
<div n="lb"/>are different persons. Further, Kāla or Yama is the
<div n="lb"/>sixth descendant of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>But scholars are misled to think that the two are iden-
<div n="lb"/>tical. There is a reason for it.
<Poem>Dharmarājaḥ Pitṛpatiḥ
<div n="lb"/>Samavarttī Paretarāṭ /
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtānto Yamunābhrātā
<div n="lb"/>Śamano Yamarāḍ Yamaḥ //
<div n="lb"/>Kālo Daṇḍadharaḥ Srāddha-
<div n="lb"/>Devo Vaivasvatontakaḥ. / (Amara).</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>The above are the synonyms of Kāla. Vyāsa has used as
<div n="lb"/>synonyms for Dharmadeva in the Mahābhārata the
<div n="lb"/>words Dharmarāja, Vṛṣa and Yama. Now among the
<div n="lb"/>synonyms for the two there are two words in common—
<div n="lb"/>Dharmarāja and Yama. This has led to this misunder-
<div n="lb"/>standing. Because Kāla weighs the evil and good in
<div n="lb"/>man he got the name Dharmarāja. Dharmadeva got
<div n="lb"/>that name because he is the incarnation of Dharma.
<div n="lb"/>The real name of Kāla is Yama. Dharmadeva got the
<div n="lb"/>name Yama because he possesses ‘Yama’ (control of
<div n="lb"/>the self for moral conduct). Kāla has no sons; Vidura
<div n="lb"/>and Yudhiṣṭhira are the sons of Dharmadeva.
