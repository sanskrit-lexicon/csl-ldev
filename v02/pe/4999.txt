PĀṆḌYA¦. I. A King of Vidarbha who was a great devotee
of Śiva. One day while he was performing Śivapūjā at
dusk he heard a loud noise outside the city and before
completing the worship he went out and faced the
enemies who were attempting to enter the city and
killed its leader. He returned after the fight and
without completing the worship took his meals. It was
a sin to do so and the King was therefore born in his
next birth as Satyaratha, a King, and was killed by
his enemies. (Śatarudrasaṃhitā, Śiva Purāṇa).
