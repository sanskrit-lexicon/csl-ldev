PĀṆḌYA¦. I. A King of Vidarbha who was a great devotee
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva. One day while he was performing Śivapūjā at
<div n="lb"/>dusk he heard a loud noise outside the city and before
<div n="lb"/>completing the worship he went out and faced the
<div n="lb"/>enemies who were attempting to enter the city and
<div n="lb"/>killed its leader. He returned after the fight and
<div n="lb"/>without completing the worship took his meals. It was
<div n="lb"/>a sin to do so and the King was therefore born in his
<div n="lb"/>next birth as Satyaratha, a King, and was killed by
<div n="lb"/>his enemies. (Śatarudrasaṃhitā, Śiva Purāṇa).
