KUŚASTHALĪ¦. The ancient name of Dvārakāpurī;
<div n="lb"/>an island. It was emperor Revata, son of Ānarta, the
<div n="lb"/>grandson of Vaivasvata Manu, who first built a city in
<div n="lb"/>Kuśasthalī and ruled the country. Their genealogy;
<div n="lb"/>Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>—Vivasvān—Vaivasvata Manu—Śaryāti (Śayyāti)—
<div n="lb"/>Ānarta—Revata. Certain Purāṇas state that it was
<div n="lb"/>Ānarta, who first built forts at Kuśasthalī. It would not
<div n="lb"/>be incorrect to say that Ānarta built forts in this city
<div n="lb"/>first founded by his son Revata. The city was sunk in
<div n="lb"/>the sea after a few years. Afterwards the region re-
<div n="lb"/>mained as a forest for long years. It was later on that
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa built Dvārakā there. Following Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>death the Yādava dynasty got annihilated and the
<div n="lb"/>region was again swallowed by the ocean. Dvārakā is
<div n="lb"/>believed to have been an island situated in the sea to
<div n="lb"/>the west of Gujarat. Even today there is a place called
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā on the coast of India to the west of Gujarat.
