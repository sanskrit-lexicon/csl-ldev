AKṢAYAVAṬA¦. A sacred lake. When the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>during their exile went to Pulastyāśrama sage Pulastya
<div n="lb"/>gave a description of all the sacred lakes in India. He
<div n="lb"/>says, “After reaching Mārkaṇḍeya lake you should visit
<div n="lb"/>the meeting place of the rivers Gaṅgā and Gomatī.
<div n="lb"/>Then when you reach Gayā you will find there a lake
<div n="lb"/>called Akṣayavaṭa. If you bathe in that lake you will
<div n="lb"/>get salvation”. In the Navama Skandha of Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata you find the following about Akṣayavaṭa: “Puṣpa-
<div n="lb"/>bhadrā is one of the famous sacred rivers in India. This
<div n="lb"/>river starts from the Himālayas with the name Śarāvatī
<div n="lb"/>and flowing for 500 yojanas (One yojanam is equal
<div n="lb"/>to about 8 miles) on the left side of river Gomatī reaches
<div n="lb"/>the western ocean. There is an āśrama called Akṣaya-
<div n="lb"/>vaṭa on the shores of this beautiful river which always
<div n="lb"/>carries crystal clear water. The āśrama got that name
<div n="lb"/>because of a big banyan tree standing near it. Kapila,
<div n="lb"/>the great sage, did penance sitting here for a long time.
<div n="lb"/>Lord Śiva, Bhadrakālī and Skanda used to come and
<div n="lb"/>sit underneath this banyan tree.
