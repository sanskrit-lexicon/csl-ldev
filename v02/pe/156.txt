AKṢAYAVAṬA¦. A sacred lake. When the Pāṇḍavas
during their exile went to Pulastyāśrama sage Pulastya
gave a description of all the sacred lakes in India. He
says, “After reaching Mārkaṇḍeya lake you should visit
the meeting place of the rivers Gaṅgā and Gomatī.
Then when you reach Gayā you will find there a lake
called Akṣayavaṭa. If you bathe in that lake you will
get salvation”. In the Navama Skandha of Devī Bhāga-
vata you find the following about Akṣayavaṭa: “Puṣpa-
bhadrā is one of the famous sacred rivers in India. This
river starts from the Himālayas with the name Śarāvatī
and flowing for 500 yojanas (One yojanam is equal
to about 8 miles) on the left side of river Gomatī reaches
the western ocean. There is an āśrama called Akṣaya-
vaṭa on the shores of this beautiful river which always
carries crystal clear water. The āśrama got that name
because of a big banyan tree standing near it. Kapila,
the great sage, did penance sitting here for a long time.
Lord Śiva, Bhadrakālī and Skanda used to come and
sit underneath this banyan tree.
