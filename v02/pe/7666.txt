UDDHAVA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A Yādava. He was a friend and
<div n="lb"/>minister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 186, Stanza 18, mention is made that Uddhava
<div n="lb"/>was present on the occasion of the Svayaṃvara (marriage)
<div n="lb"/>of Draupadī. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 218, Stanza 11, that at a famous cele-
<div n="lb"/>bration held in the mountain of Raivata, Uddhava was
<div n="lb"/>present. (See under Subhadrā).
<div n="NI"/>Uddhava was a disciple of Bṛhaspati, and a man of
<div n="lb"/>great intelligence. It was this Uddhava who brought the
<div n="lb"/>dowry of Subhadrā to Indraprastha, when Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>married her. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 220, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>30).
<div n="NI"/>Once a king named Śālva besieged the city of Dvār-
<div n="lb"/>akā. At that time Uddhava saved Dvārakā. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 15, Stanza 9).
<div n="NI"/>2). {%The message carried by Uddhava.%} Kaṃsa sent Akrūra
<div n="lb"/>to Ambāḍi, and brought Śrī Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa and made Ugrasena king, and
<div n="lb"/>stayed in the city of Mathurā for a time. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa sent Uddhava to Ambāḍi to know about the
<div n="lb"/>well-being of the people there. The moment Uddhava
<div n="lb"/>entered Ambāḍi, the Gopas and gopa women, (cow-
<div n="lb"/>herds) Yaśodā and Nandagopa, all surrounded him to
<div n="lb"/>hear about Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They felt much pleased at
<div n="lb"/>knowing that Śrī Kṛṣṇa was getting on well. They sent
<div n="lb"/>through him many presents to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He got
<div n="lb"/>all those presents into his chariot and took them to
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Mathurā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%The end.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa informed Uddhava before-
<div n="lb"/>hand the fact that the Yādava dynasty was going
[Page804-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>to end. Uddhava felt grief and requested Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>to take him also to Vaikuṇṭha (the abode of Mahāviṣṇu).
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa taught Uddhava the doctrine that the body
<div n="lb"/>of man and such other things seen in the whole universe
<div n="lb"/>were nothing but mere delusion. At that time Uddhava
<div n="lb"/>asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa twentyone questions about Bandha
<div n="lb"/>and Mokṣa (Bondage and deliverance).
<div n="NI"/>To all these questions Srī Kṛṣṇa gave him satisfactory
<div n="lb"/>answers. (Bhāgavata Skandha 11).
<div n="NI"/>Before the destruction of Dvārakā, the Yadus left the
<div n="lb"/>city. They went to Prabhāsatīrtha, a place on the sea
<div n="lb"/>coast and lived there. Uddhava who knew that the
<div n="lb"/>destruction was imminent, bade farewell to them and
<div n="lb"/>walked away alone. He was filled with a brightness.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa did not stop him. (M.B. Mausala Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>It is stated in Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, Chapter 29,
<div n="lb"/>that Uddhava went to the hermitage of Badarikā and
<div n="lb"/>engaged himself in penance.
