ṬHIṆṬHĀKARĀLA¦. A prodigal person who lived in
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayinī. He used to defeat all in the game of dice.
<div n="lb"/>With the money so received from defeated persons he
<div n="lb"/>would buy wheat and go to the burial ground and after
<div n="lb"/>making bread with it would eat it dipped in ghee sitting
<div n="lb"/>before an oil light placed before an idol of Mahākāla
<div n="lb"/>(lord of the burial ground). He would then lie there
<div n="lb"/>itself and sleep.
<div n="NI"/>One night he saw the idols in the Mahākāla temple twin-
<div n="lb"/>kling. He jumped up and challenged the idols for a
<div n="lb"/>game of dice. The idols stood mute and Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla
<div n="lb"/>taking their silence to be consent according to the rules
<div n="lb"/>of gambling fixed a wager and played. He won and
<div n="lb"/>then he said addressing the idols “I have defeated you.
<div n="lb"/>Give me the money due to me.” The idols stood silent
<div n="lb"/>and he, therefore, wrestled with them. Still the idols
<div n="lb"/>stood dumb. Then Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla took his sword.
<div n="lb"/>Instantly the devas gave him the money due to him.
<div n="lb"/>Early morning he went away from there and spent the
<div n="lb"/>money lavishly. At night he came back again and
<div n="lb"/>challenged the idols for gambling as before. This be-
<div n="lb"/>came a daily routine and the devas felt themselves
<div n="lb"/>harassed. They, therefore, approached the goddess
<div n="lb"/>Cāmuṇḍī and she advised them to refrain from playing
<div n="lb"/>as there was no loss of honour if one refused to take a
<div n="lb"/>challenge to gamble.
<div n="NI"/>That night also as usual Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla came and chal-
<div n="lb"/>lenged the idols for a game of dice. Then the idols said
<div n="lb"/>“We are not prepared to play.” Then he challenged
<div n="lb"/>Mahākāla himself to play. Mahākāla also refused to
<div n="lb"/>play. Then suddenly the mind of Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla
<div n="lb"/>changed and he did penance to please Mahākāla. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>kāla was pleased with him, appeared before him and
<div n="lb"/>blessed him.
<div n="NI"/>Once a few nymphs came to bathe in the Mahākālī
<div n="lb"/>pond and as per the instructions of Mahākāla, Ṭhiṇṭhā-
[Page788-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>karāla took away their robes while they were bathing.
<div n="lb"/>He demanded a nymph named Kalāvatī in return for
<div n="lb"/>their robes and finding no other way they gave him
<div n="lb"/>Kalāvatī.
<div n="NI"/>Kalāvatī thus became the wife of a Man due to a curse
<div n="lb"/>of Indra. Once she praised sexual enjoyment with men
<div n="lb"/>on earth and decried the same with Devas. Indra heard
<div n="lb"/>it and he cursed her “Then let her become the wife of a
<div n="lb"/>man on earth and enjoy the pleasures there.” All this
<div n="lb"/>story Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla learned from Kalāvatī. She added
<div n="lb"/>she wanted to go to Devaloka the next day for a dance
<div n="lb"/>with Rambhā. Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla consented and he also went
<div n="lb"/>to Devaloka and saw the dance, sitting along with the
<div n="lb"/>Devas.
<div n="NI"/>When Rambhā's dance was over, there was the dance
<div n="lb"/>of a goat. Seeing that Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla said to himself:
<div n="lb"/>“Why, this is a goat I used to see daily in Ujjayinī. How
<div n="lb"/>did it come here to dance?” When the dances were over
<div n="lb"/>and the people dispersed, Kalāvatī took Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla
<div n="lb"/>to the Mahākālī temple. Next day he met the same
<div n="lb"/>goat in Ujjayinī and then he enquired “Hi, do that
<div n="lb"/>dance which you did yesterday before Indra in devaloka.
<div n="lb"/>Let me see” The goat stood dumb thinking of how
<div n="lb"/>this man on earth came to know of the dances in Deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka. Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla once again compelled the goat to
<div n="lb"/>show its dance but when the goat still refused to dance,
<div n="lb"/>he thrashed it with a stick on its head and the goat
<div n="lb"/>immediately went to Devaloka and informed Indra
<div n="lb"/>about the incident. Indra felt sad when he saw blood
<div n="lb"/>oozing from the wound on its head. Indra by his divine
<div n="lb"/>powers then understood that Kalāvatī was at the bottom
<div n="lb"/>of all this trouble and cursed her to remain as a doll
<div n="lb"/>on a pillar in the temple belonging to King Narasiṃha
<div n="lb"/>of Nāgapura. Alambuṣā, mother of Kalāvatī, who heard
<div n="lb"/>the curse begged for relief and Indra said she would get
<div n="lb"/>freed from the curse when the king himself demolished
<div n="lb"/>the temple and razed the place to the ground.
<div n="NI"/>True to the curse, Kalāvatī after giving all her orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments to Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla bid him good bye and went
<div n="lb"/>and remained as a doll on the temple-pillar at Nāga-
<div n="lb"/>pura. Deeply distressed at this mishap of his wife,
<div n="lb"/>Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla dressed himself as an ascetic and went to
<div n="lb"/>Nāgapura. There he purchased five earthen pots and
<div n="lb"/>filled them with the ornaments of Kalāvatī. He buried
<div n="lb"/>four of the pots in the forests and the fifth in the bazaar
<div n="lb"/>near the temple. Then he built a hermitage on the
<div n="lb"/>shores of a near-by river and started living there. News
<div n="lb"/>soon spread that a great yogī had come to the city and
<div n="lb"/>the King went to see him. They talked for a while on
<div n="lb"/>religious and spiritual matters and the King was about
<div n="lb"/>to leave when they heard the howl of a jackal. The
<div n="lb"/>yogī smiled and the King asked him why he smiled.
<div n="lb"/>He refused to answer but the King insisted and then
<div n="lb"/>the yogī said “Oh King, the jackal says that in a forest
<div n="lb"/>to the east of the city under a silver plant is a treasure.”
<div n="lb"/>The King immediately ordered his men to go and dig
<div n="lb"/>at the place and when they did they got the treasure.
<div n="lb"/>The King offered the treasure to the yogī but he
<div n="lb"/>refused to accept it. Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla then on three
<div n="lb"/>different occasions pointed out to the King the three
<div n="lb"/>other pots in the forests and the King got great confi-
<div n="lb"/>dence in the powers of the yogī. One day he went to
<div n="lb"/>the temple with the King and while they were walking
<div n="lb"/>around a crow crow and the yogī smiled. The King
<div n="lb"/>again asked him the reason and the yogī said that
[Page789-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>there was a treasure pot in the bazaar near-by. When
<div n="lb"/>they searched at the spot directed by the yogī the
<div n="lb"/>treasure was found.
<div n="NI"/>On another day the King and the yogī went to the
<div n="lb"/>temple and as they walked about they saw the doll on
<div n="lb"/>one of the pillars crying. The King asked the yogī the
<div n="lb"/>reason for the doll crying thus. The yogī replied
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, King this temple is not located in a proper place.
<div n="lb"/>Further the deity here was not installed at an auspi-
<div n="lb"/>cious time. If this continues the King will come to
<div n="lb"/>ruin. That was why the doll cried.” On hearing this
<div n="lb"/>the King ordered the temple to be completely demo-
<div n="lb"/>lished and the place made a plain ground. The order
<div n="lb"/>was carried out and Kalāvatī got release from the
<div n="lb"/>curse. She went to heaven and told Indra all that had
<div n="lb"/>happened. Indra immediately sent Kalāvatī to fetch
<div n="lb"/>Ṭhiṇṭhākarāla to heaven and then both of them lived
<div n="lb"/>happily in heaven. (Taraṅga 2, Viṣamaśīlalambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara).
