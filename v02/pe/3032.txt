JYOTIṢA¦(M). (Astronomy and astrology). Jyotiṣa is
<div n="lb"/>the science about the stars and heavenly bodies. The
<div n="lb"/>heavenly bodies are the sun, the moon, the other
<div n="lb"/>planets and the stars etc. From the very ancient days
<div n="lb"/>men believed that these planets and stars in the sky
<div n="lb"/>played an important part in controlling the growth
<div n="lb"/>and activities of all the living and non-living things
<div n="lb"/>in the world.
<div n="NI"/>Astrology has been a recognized science in Egypt, China
<div n="lb"/>and India from very ancient days. History tells us that
<div n="lb"/>3000 years before Christ there were astronomers in
<div n="lb"/>Babylon. But even before that time astronomy had fully
<div n="lb"/>expanded and grown in Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>The Vedas are supposed to have six Aṅgas (ancillaries)
<div n="lb"/>They are Śikṣā (Phonetics), Kalpa (ritual), Vyākaraṇa
<div n="lb"/>(Grammar), Jyotiṣa (astronomy) Chandas (metrics),
<div n="lb"/>and Nirukta (etymology). From this it can be said that
<div n="lb"/>the Indians had acknowledged Astronomy as an anci-
<div n="lb"/>llary of the Vedas. The expounders of the Vedas say
<div n="lb"/>that Astronomy is the eye of the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>Astronomy has two sides, the doctrinal side (Pramāṇa-
<div n="lb"/>bhāga) and the result-side (Phalabhāga). The Calendar
<div n="lb"/>is reckoned in accordance with the Pramāṇa-bhāga.
<div n="lb"/>Prediction and casting horoscopes of living beings is the
<div n="lb"/>Phala-bhāga.

<div n="NI"/>The astronomers have divided the sky that surrounds
<div n="lb"/>the earth into twelve parts called rāś is (zodiacs). All
<div n="lb"/>the stars of the first zodiac appear in the shape of a goat
<div n="lb"/>(Meṣa) so that zodiac was called Meṣa. Thus the
<div n="lb"/>zodiac in which the stars took the shape of an ox was
<div n="lb"/>called Ṛṣabha (ox). In the zodiac Mithuna the stars
<div n="lb"/>took the shape of a young couple. Karkaṭaka means
<div n="lb"/>crab. In that zodiac the stars appear in the shape of
<div n="lb"/>a crab. In the same way Siṃha means lion and Kanyā
<div n="lb"/>means a damsel. Tulā means balance and Vṛścika
<div n="lb"/>means scorpion; Dhanus means bow and Makara means
<div n="lb"/>Makara matsya (horned shark). Kumbha is a water
<div n="lb"/>pot and Mīna means fish. The name of the zodiac is
<div n="lb"/>according to the sign of the zodiac. That is, in what
<div n="lb"/>shape the stars in that particular zodiac appear to the
<div n="lb"/>people of the earth. The figure of the twelve zodiacs
<div n="lb"/>with the earth as centre is given below:—
<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>Mīna <C n="2"/>Meṣa <C n="3"/>Ṛṣabha <C n="4"/>Mithuna
<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>Kumbha <C n="2"/>Karkaṭaka
<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>Makara <C n="2"/>Siṃha
<div n="lb"/><C n="1"/>Dhanus <C n="2"/>Vṛścika <C n="3"/>Tulā <C n="4"/>Kanyā
<div n="NI"/>In Kerala and some other places the zodiacs are marked
<div n="lb"/>to the right in order beginning with Meṣa, whereas it is
<div n="lb"/>marked to the left in the same order in some of the
<div n="lb"/>other parts of India.
<div n="NI"/>The earth completes one rotation in 60 Nāḍikās (24
<div n="lb"/>minutes) i.e. 24 hours. In each rotation these twelve
<div n="lb"/>zodiacs face the earth. For a man standing at a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular point on the earth it will take 60% 12 i.e. 5
<div n="lb"/>nāḍikās (two hours) on an average, for a zodiac to pass
<div n="lb"/>him. But it may vary in different places according to
<div n="lb"/>the difference of the shape of the earth. A month is the
<div n="lb"/>time the sun remains in a zodiac. The planet Jupiter
<div n="lb"/>takes a year and Saturn two years and a half on an
<div n="lb"/>average to pass a zodiac. The calendar shows which
<div n="lb"/>are the planets standing in each zodiac and how far
<div n="lb"/>they have travelled at a particular time in that parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular zodiac. When a particular zodiac is in a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular region of the earth, a man born in that region is
<div n="lb"/>said to be born in that zodiac. When a particular
<div n="lb"/>place faces the zodiac of Meṣa the child which takes
<div n="lb"/>birth in that place is said to be born in the zodiac of
<div n="lb"/>Meṣa. The zodiac of birth is given the name Lagna by
<div n="lb"/>astronomers. Those who are well-versed in the result-
<div n="lb"/>side of astronomy are of opinion that the life,
<div n="lb"/>fortune etc. of living beings depend upon the position
<div n="lb"/>of the planets in relation to their lagnas.
