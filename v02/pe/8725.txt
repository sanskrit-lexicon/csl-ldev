YAMUNĀ¦. Another name for the river Kālindī. (See
<div n="lb"/>also under Kālindī).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How the water in Kālindī turned Black:%}-The water in
<div n="lb"/>the river Kālindi is black in colour. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>behind the changing of the colour of this river-water
<div n="lb"/>into black. Originally it was clear.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of Satī, Dakṣa's daughter, Śiva broke
<div n="lb"/>up Dakṣa yāga and went about rambling round the
<div n="lb"/>world. Kāmadeva who saw Śiva who had lost his wife
<div n="lb"/>(Satī) shot him with “Unmādāstra” (an arrow causing
<div n="lb"/>madness and excitement). Śiva, in his excitement,
<div n="lb"/>always thinking about Satī, wandered about, finding
<div n="lb"/>peace and rest nowhere. In his excited and restless
<div n="lb"/>state he plunged himself into Kālindī river. Just then,
<div n="lb"/>the clear water of the river turned black. (Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The greatness of Kālindī (Yamunā).%} The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>declare that by bathing in the holy Kālindī one attains
<div n="lb"/>heaven. There is a story illustrating this in Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 30, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Long ago, in Kṛtayuga, there lived in the country of
[Page894-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Niṣadha, a very wealthy Vaiśya, by name Hemakuṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍala. By doing various kinds of business, he had earned
<div n="lb"/>eight crores of golden coins. By that time he was advanc-
<div n="lb"/>ing in age. At this stage he began to think of the transi-
<div n="lb"/>toriness of worldly pleasures and set apart one-sixth of
<div n="lb"/>his entire wealth for charitable purposes. He built two
<div n="lb"/>temples—one for Viṣṇu and the other for Śiva. He
<div n="lb"/>offered daily worship to the gods and spent money in
<div n="lb"/>generous hospitality. His two sons, Śrīkuṇḍala and
<div n="lb"/>Vikuṇḍala were growing up. He entrusted the burden
<div n="lb"/>of domestic affairs to them and went to the forest to
<div n="lb"/>perform austere tapas, after which he attained Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>loka.
<div n="NI"/>His sons, who were intoxicated with their affluent and
<div n="lb"/>luxurious life, deviated from the path of virtue and
<div n="lb"/>began to indulge in all kinds of sensual pleasures. It
<div n="lb"/>did not take long for them to be reduced to utter
<div n="lb"/>poverty. Their relatives and dependants left them to
<div n="lb"/>their fate and at last, they began to resort to stealing.
<div n="lb"/>For fear of the King, the public and the law, they
<div n="lb"/>changed their residence to the woods. One of them
<div n="lb"/>went to a mountain and the other to a forest. One day,
<div n="lb"/>the elder brother was caught by a tiger and the younger
<div n="lb"/>was bit by a snake. Both of them died on the same day.
<div n="lb"/>Yama's agents took both to Yamaloka. Dharmarāja
<div n="lb"/>(Yama) ordered the elder brother to be sent to Naraka
<div n="lb"/>(Hell) and the younger one (Vikuṇḍala) to be sent to
<div n="lb"/>Heaven.
<div n="NI"/>Vikuṇḍala who knew that he did not deserve Heaven
<div n="lb"/>by any standards, asked Yama's agent how this had
<div n="lb"/>happened. The agent gave him this answer:—“There
<div n="lb"/>was a Brāhmaṇa well-versed in Vedic lore, who was the
<div n="lb"/>son of Harimitra. His āśrama was on the southern bank
<div n="lb"/>of Yamunā. While you were living in the forest, you were
<div n="lb"/>associated with him. As a result of that contact, it so
<div n="lb"/>happened that you bathed for two months in the holy
<div n="lb"/>river Kālindī, the waters of which have the power of
<div n="lb"/>absolving sinners. By your bath in the first month
<div n="lb"/>you were liberated from all sins. By the second you
<div n="lb"/>have become eligible for Heaven. You have qualified
<div n="lb"/>yourself for the eternal bliss of Heaven, by that holy
<div n="lb"/>act.”
<div n="NI"/>Yamunā is being worshipped as a goddess. Devotees of
<div n="lb"/>this goddess imagine her as riding on a tortoise, carry-
<div n="lb"/>ing a water pot in her hand and is of black complexion.
<div n="lb"/>(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 50).
