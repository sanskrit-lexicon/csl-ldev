PUṢKARADHĀRIṆĪ¦. The wife of a sage. There was
<div n="lb"/>once a sage named Satya in the country of Vidarbha.
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkaradhāriṇī was the wife of Satya. Satya who be-
<div n="lb"/>lieved in Ahiṃsā performed a Yāga with fruits and
<div n="lb"/>roots. It is believed that no yāga is perfect if performed
<div n="lb"/>without a sacrificial goat. But even his wife for fear of
<div n="lb"/>a curse did not object to a Yāga of the kind.
<div n="NI"/>There was another sage living in that forest in the form
<div n="lb"/>of a deer due to a curse and he was a great friend of
<div n="lb"/>Satya. The deer came to the place of the Yajña and
<div n="lb"/>requested Satya to kill him as the sacrificial animal to
<div n="lb"/>make the Yāga a success. Satya did not agree to that
<div n="lb"/>but then Sāvitrīdevī appeared in person and compelled
<div n="lb"/>him to kill the deer and conduct the Yāga. With great
<div n="lb"/>reluctance Satya killed the deer and conducted the
<div n="lb"/>Yāga; but the power of penance of Satya faded away
<div n="lb"/>by that deed of his. Then Puṣkaradhāriṇī performed
<div n="lb"/>penance to regain the power of her husband and
<div n="lb"/>Dharma appeared in person and blessed Satya.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 272, Śānti Parva).
