PUṢKARADHĀRIṆĪ¦. The wife of a sage. There was
once a sage named Satya in the country of Vidarbha.
Puṣkaradhāriṇī was the wife of Satya. Satya who be-
lieved in Ahiṃsā performed a Yāga with fruits and
roots. It is believed that no yāga is perfect if performed
without a sacrificial goat. But even his wife for fear of
a curse did not object to a Yāga of the kind.
<div n="NI"/>There was another sage living in that forest in the form
of a deer due to a curse and he was a great friend of
Satya. The deer came to the place of the Yajña and
requested Satya to kill him as the sacrificial animal to
make the Yāga a success. Satya did not agree to that
but then Sāvitrīdevī appeared in person and compelled
him to kill the deer and conduct the Yāga. With great
reluctance Satya killed the deer and conducted the
Yāga; but the power of penance of Satya faded away
by that deed of his. Then Puṣkaradhāriṇī performed
penance to regain the power of her husband and
Dharma appeared in person and blessed Satya.
(Chapter 272, Śānti Parva).
