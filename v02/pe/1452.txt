CANDRAŚEKHARA¦. A King (son of Pauṣya). The
following story about his birth is told in the Padma
Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Though married for a long time Pauṣya did not have an
issue. He began worshipping Śiva to be blessed with a
son. Śiva was pleased at this and he gave him a fruit
which he divided equally among his three wives. In
due course the three wives delivered. But, to get the
full and complete form of a child the three children had to
be joined together, and so the parts were unified. This
boy was Candraśekhara. Thus Candraśekhara acquired
the name Tryaṃbaka.
<div n="NI"/>Candraśekhara married Tārāvatī, daughter of Kaku-
tstha, a King of the solar dynasty. On account of the
curse of Kapotamuni two sons, Bhṛṅgi and Mahākāla
were born to Tārāvatī in Vetāla yoni and Bhairava
yoni respectively. Dama, Uparicara and Alarka were
sons born to Candraśekhara himself. (Aurasaputras).
