KĀPILEYA¦. Son of Viśvāmitra. After saving Śunaś-
<div n="lb"/>śepha from death, Viśvāmitra was fondling the child
<div n="lb"/>on his lap. At that time, the child's father Ajīgarta
<div n="lb"/>came to him and wanted Viśvāmitra to return the
<div n="lb"/>child to him. Viśvāmitra then told him “Like
<div n="lb"/>Kāpileya and Bābhravya, this is also my son.”
<div n="lb"/>From this we may infer that Kāpileya must have
<div n="lb"/>been Viśvāmitra's son. (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa).
