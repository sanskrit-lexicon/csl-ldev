KĀPILEYA¦. Son of Viśvāmitra. After saving Śunaś-
śepha from death, Viśvāmitra was fondling the child
on his lap. At that time, the child's father Ajīgarta
came to him and wanted Viśvāmitra to return the
child to him. Viśvāmitra then told him “Like
Kāpileya and Bābhravya, this is also my son.”
From this we may infer that Kāpileya must have
been Viśvāmitra's son. (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa).
