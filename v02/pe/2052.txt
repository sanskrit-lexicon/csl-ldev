DHYĀNA¦. (Meditation). Even from ancient times the
people of Bhārata believed that heaven could be attain-
ed by meditation. There are scientific methods of
meditating upon God. They are described below:
<div n="NI"/>The root “dhyai”, means “to think”. Dhyāna (medi-
tation) means thinking of God with concentration.
God is invisible and figureless. We can meditate only
upon some material that contains the attributes of God.
So dhyāna (meditation) is to fix the mind on the
object of meditation, and to imagine that particular
object in a particular place and to concentrate the
mind upon it. One who casts off his body, while engag-
ed in meditation attains ‘Sāyujya’ (oneness with God).

<div n="NI"/>He who can meditate upon God, with concentration
of mind even for a moment or two can attain heaven.
The fruits he attains are far greater than the fruits
attained by performing great sacrifices and offerings.
For meditation, there are four factors: Dhyātā (the
meditator), Dhyāna (the act of meditation) Dhyeya
(the object meditated upon) and Dhyānaprayojana
(the attainment by meditation). He who indulges in
meditation is the meditator. The act done by him is
meditation. That which is meditated upon is the object
of meditation. What the meditator obtains as a result
of his meditation is the attainment. A meditator should
be wise and virtuous, should have attention and patie-
nce, devoted to Viṣṇu and always energetic.
<div n="NI"/>We can meditate upon God, walking, standing, sleeping
and awake. God should be consecrated in the centre of
the lotus chair of the heart and be worshipped with de-
votional meditation. It is to give practice in fixing the
mind firmly on a particular object, that the sages say
that some visible material object should be given to
meditate upon, in the early stage of meditation. When
concentration of mind is obtained by meditating upon
a visible object, it will be possible for us to meditate
upon an object which is not amenable to our senses.
When engaged in meditation we should be thinking
“Ahaṃ Brahmā jyotirātmā vāsudevo vimukta Oṃ”. (I
am Brahmā, the light, the Spirit, Vāsudeva, and Vimukta
(having no connection with anything), OM). (Agni
Purāṇa, Chapter 374).
