KĀMA I¦. God of beauty in Indian mythology.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Prajāpati named Dharma was born
from the right breast of Brahmā. Dharma was very
handsome. Three sons, Śama, Kāma and Harṣa who
were exceedingly handsome, were born to him. Of
them, Kāma became the god of beauty. His wife was
Rati. Śama became the husband of Prāpti. Harṣa had
Nandā for his wife. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 66,
Verses 31-33).
<div n="NI"/>In Kālikā Purāṇa we see another story about Kāma's
birth. Brahmā created ten Prajāpatis. After that, the
woman Sandhyā was created. At the very moment of
her birth, Brahmā and the Prajāpatis were irresistibly
fascinated by her charm and they sprang up from
their seats. All their thoughts converged on the same
object. At this time a handsome youth emerged from
Brahmā's mind with a floral bow in his hands.
Immediately after his birth, he asked Brahmā “Kaṃ
darpayāmi” (Whom should I make proud?) Brahmā
replied—Let the minds of living beings be the aim of
your arrows”. He suggested Rati the daughter of
Dakṣa, to be Kāma's wife. Since he stirred the mind
of Brahmā, he got the name “MANMATHA”, and
since he was extremely attractive in appearance he
came to be called “KĀMA”. (For further details, see
under “RATI.”)
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Kāmadeva got the name “KANDARPA”.%} As soon
as Kāma was born, he went to Brahmā and asked him
“Kaṃ darpayāmi?” (Whom should I make proud?).
Therefore he got the name “KANDARPA”. (Kathā-
saritsāgara).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brahmā cursed Kāma.%} Once Brahmā was meditating
upon Para Brahman for the purpose of creation. He
felt carnal thoughts rising in his mind. At once a girl
was born from his mind. She appeared before him and
did obeisance to him. This girl was Sarasvatī. Brahmā
fell in love with her. He declared that she should stay
in the tongues of all living beings, and particularly at
the tip of the tongues of all scholars. After that he
made Sarasvatī his wife. Soon he felt repentant for his
weakness of mind. His anger blazed at Kāma who was
the cause of all this. He cursed that Kāma would be
burnt to ashes in the fire from Śiva's third eye. After
that Brahmā gave his carnal desire to the great sage
Atri who transferred it to his wife Anasūyā. It hardened
itself within her and took the form of Candra, who
was thus born to her. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter
43).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kāma was burnt up in fire.%} Long ago an Asura
named Tāraka, who was proud of his invincible might,
was causing much havoc and terror in the whole world.
Even the gods were afraid of him because he had received
a boon that Śiva's son alone was capable of killing him.
It was the time when Pārvatī, the daughter of Himavān,
was performing a penance praying that Parameśvara
should become her husband. Taking advantage of this
opportunity, Indra sent Kāma to rouse the passion of
love in Śiva's mind. Kāma reached Śiva's seat and
tried to stir up his passions. Śiva who was enraged at
this, opened his third eye blazing with fire. Kāma was.
[Page379-a+ 63]
burnt to ashes in that fire. The place where Kāma's
body (Aṅga) fell, came to be called “Aṅgarājya”. Since
he lost his body, Kāmadeva got another name
“Anaṅga”. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. Bāla Kāṇḍa, Chap-
ter 23).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kāma's Next Birth.%} When Śiva burnt up Kāma,
the latter's wife Rati prayed to Śiva to restore her hus-
band to life. Śiva was pleased and said that Rati would
be born in the world and Kāma would take birth as
her son.” (Kathāsaritsāgara).
<div n="NI"/>According to Śiva's blessing Rati was born in the world
under the name of Māyāvatī. She became the kitchen-
maid of an Asura named Śambara. At that time Śrī
Kṛṣṇa approached Śiva with a request that he should
be blessed with a son. Śiva blessed him saying that
Kāma who was burnt up in the fire of his eye would be
born as the son of Rukmiṇī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's wife. Accord-
ingly, Rukmiṇī, conceived and a handsome child was
born to her.
<div n="NI"/>Śambara, who employed Māyāvatī as his kitchen-maid
had received a boon from Śiva. A condition laid down
in it was that Śambara would die not long after
Kāmadeva's birth in the world. So Śambara was mak-
ing careful enquiries to ascertain whether Kāma was
born anywhere in the world. It was during this period
that Śambara received the news that Kāma had been
reborn as Śrī Kṛṣṇa's son. At once he went secretly to
Rukmiṇī's house and stole the little baby and threw it
into the sea. A sea-fish swallowed the child and a
fisherman who caught it presented it to Śambara. When
Śambara cut it open, he saw a lovely baby inside the
fish. He entrusted the child to Māyāvatī to be brought
up.
<div n="NI"/>At this stage, the sage Nārada happened to come there
and he explained to Māyāvatī in secret, that the baby
was Kāmadeva and she was Rati. From that time, she
brought up the child with great affection and tenderness.
As years passed and Kāma grew up into a youth,
Māyāvatī began to make amorous advances towards
him. Looking upon her with regard due to a mother,
Kāma was displeased with these advances. Then she told
him what Nārada had disclosed to her about their rela-
tions in the past life. She advised him to kill Śambara
and to leave the place for Dvārakā as soon as possible.
<div n="NI"/>As advised by her, Kāma killed Śambara and both he
and Māyāvatī went to Dvārakā in a Vimāna and paid
their respects to their parents there. In the presence of a
large number of sages, Kāma was christened “Prad-
yumna”. Aniruddha, the husband of Uṣā, was the son of
Pradyumna. Besides Aniruddha, Pradyumna had a
daughter Tṛṣā.
<F>1.) From Kathāsaritsāgara we find that Udayana and Vāsavadattā were the rebirths of Kāma and Rati.</F>
