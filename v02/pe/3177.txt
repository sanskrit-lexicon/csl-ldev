KĀMA I¦. God of beauty in Indian mythology.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Prajāpati named Dharma was born
<div n="lb"/>from the right breast of Brahmā. Dharma was very
<div n="lb"/>handsome. Three sons, Śama, Kāma and Harṣa who
<div n="lb"/>were exceedingly handsome, were born to him. Of
<div n="lb"/>them, Kāma became the god of beauty. His wife was
<div n="lb"/>Rati. Śama became the husband of Prāpti. Harṣa had
<div n="lb"/>Nandā for his wife. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 66,
<div n="lb"/>Verses 31-33).
<div n="NI"/>In Kālikā Purāṇa we see another story about Kāma's
<div n="lb"/>birth. Brahmā created ten Prajāpatis. After that, the
<div n="lb"/>woman Sandhyā was created. At the very moment of
<div n="lb"/>her birth, Brahmā and the Prajāpatis were irresistibly
<div n="lb"/>fascinated by her charm and they sprang up from
<div n="lb"/>their seats. All their thoughts converged on the same
<div n="lb"/>object. At this time a handsome youth emerged from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's mind with a floral bow in his hands.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately after his birth, he asked Brahmā “Kaṃ
<div n="lb"/>darpayāmi” (Whom should I make proud?) Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>replied—Let the minds of living beings be the aim of
<div n="lb"/>your arrows”. He suggested Rati the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa, to be Kāma's wife. Since he stirred the mind
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā, he got the name “MANMATHA”, and
<div n="lb"/>since he was extremely attractive in appearance he
<div n="lb"/>came to be called “KĀMA”. (For further details, see
<div n="lb"/>under “RATI.”)
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Kāmadeva got the name “KANDARPA”.%} As soon
<div n="lb"/>as Kāma was born, he went to Brahmā and asked him
<div n="lb"/>“Kaṃ darpayāmi?” (Whom should I make proud?).
<div n="lb"/>Therefore he got the name “KANDARPA”. (Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brahmā cursed Kāma.%} Once Brahmā was meditating
<div n="lb"/>upon Para Brahman for the purpose of creation. He
<div n="lb"/>felt carnal thoughts rising in his mind. At once a girl
<div n="lb"/>was born from his mind. She appeared before him and
<div n="lb"/>did obeisance to him. This girl was Sarasvatī. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with her. He declared that she should stay
<div n="lb"/>in the tongues of all living beings, and particularly at
<div n="lb"/>the tip of the tongues of all scholars. After that he
<div n="lb"/>made Sarasvatī his wife. Soon he felt repentant for his
<div n="lb"/>weakness of mind. His anger blazed at Kāma who was
<div n="lb"/>the cause of all this. He cursed that Kāma would be
<div n="lb"/>burnt to ashes in the fire from Śiva's third eye. After
<div n="lb"/>that Brahmā gave his carnal desire to the great sage
<div n="lb"/>Atri who transferred it to his wife Anasūyā. It hardened
<div n="lb"/>itself within her and took the form of Candra, who
<div n="lb"/>was thus born to her. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>43).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kāma was burnt up in fire.%} Long ago an Asura
<div n="lb"/>named Tāraka, who was proud of his invincible might,
<div n="lb"/>was causing much havoc and terror in the whole world.
<div n="lb"/>Even the gods were afraid of him because he had received
<div n="lb"/>a boon that Śiva's son alone was capable of killing him.
<div n="lb"/>It was the time when Pārvatī, the daughter of Himavān,
<div n="lb"/>was performing a penance praying that Parameśvara
<div n="lb"/>should become her husband. Taking advantage of this
<div n="lb"/>opportunity, Indra sent Kāma to rouse the passion of
<div n="lb"/>love in Śiva's mind. Kāma reached Śiva's seat and
<div n="lb"/>tried to stir up his passions. Śiva who was enraged at
<div n="lb"/>this, opened his third eye blazing with fire. Kāma was.
[Page379-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>burnt to ashes in that fire. The place where Kāma's
<div n="lb"/>body (Aṅga) fell, came to be called “Aṅgarājya”. Since
<div n="lb"/>he lost his body, Kāmadeva got another name
<div n="lb"/>“Anaṅga”. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. Bāla Kāṇḍa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 23).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kāma's Next Birth.%} When Śiva burnt up Kāma,
<div n="lb"/>the latter's wife Rati prayed to Śiva to restore her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band to life. Śiva was pleased and said that Rati would
<div n="lb"/>be born in the world and Kāma would take birth as
<div n="lb"/>her son.” (Kathāsaritsāgara).
<div n="NI"/>According to Śiva's blessing Rati was born in the world
<div n="lb"/>under the name of Māyāvatī. She became the kitchen-
<div n="lb"/>maid of an Asura named Śambara. At that time Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa approached Śiva with a request that he should
<div n="lb"/>be blessed with a son. Śiva blessed him saying that
<div n="lb"/>Kāma who was burnt up in the fire of his eye would be
<div n="lb"/>born as the son of Rukmiṇī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's wife. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly, Rukmiṇī, conceived and a handsome child was
<div n="lb"/>born to her.
<div n="NI"/>Śambara, who employed Māyāvatī as his kitchen-maid
<div n="lb"/>had received a boon from Śiva. A condition laid down
<div n="lb"/>in it was that Śambara would die not long after
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva's birth in the world. So Śambara was mak-
<div n="lb"/>ing careful enquiries to ascertain whether Kāma was
<div n="lb"/>born anywhere in the world. It was during this period
<div n="lb"/>that Śambara received the news that Kāma had been
<div n="lb"/>reborn as Śrī Kṛṣṇa's son. At once he went secretly to
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī's house and stole the little baby and threw it
<div n="lb"/>into the sea. A sea-fish swallowed the child and a
<div n="lb"/>fisherman who caught it presented it to Śambara. When
<div n="lb"/>Śambara cut it open, he saw a lovely baby inside the
<div n="lb"/>fish. He entrusted the child to Māyāvatī to be brought
<div n="lb"/>up.
<div n="NI"/>At this stage, the sage Nārada happened to come there
<div n="lb"/>and he explained to Māyāvatī in secret, that the baby
<div n="lb"/>was Kāmadeva and she was Rati. From that time, she
<div n="lb"/>brought up the child with great affection and tenderness.
<div n="lb"/>As years passed and Kāma grew up into a youth,
<div n="lb"/>Māyāvatī began to make amorous advances towards
<div n="lb"/>him. Looking upon her with regard due to a mother,
<div n="lb"/>Kāma was displeased with these advances. Then she told
<div n="lb"/>him what Nārada had disclosed to her about their rela-
<div n="lb"/>tions in the past life. She advised him to kill Śambara
<div n="lb"/>and to leave the place for Dvārakā as soon as possible.
<div n="NI"/>As advised by her, Kāma killed Śambara and both he
<div n="lb"/>and Māyāvatī went to Dvārakā in a Vimāna and paid
<div n="lb"/>their respects to their parents there. In the presence of a
<div n="lb"/>large number of sages, Kāma was christened “Prad-
<div n="lb"/>yumna”. Aniruddha, the husband of Uṣā, was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna. Besides Aniruddha, Pradyumna had a
<div n="lb"/>daughter Tṛṣā.
<F>1.) From Kathāsaritsāgara we find that Udayana and Vāsavadattā were the rebirths of Kāma and Rati.</F>
