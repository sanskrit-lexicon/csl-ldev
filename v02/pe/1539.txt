CIRAKĀRĪ¦. A son of Gautama Maharṣi. He used to
<div n="lb"/>think deeply before doing any deed and so he earned the
<div n="lb"/>name Cirakārī.
<div n="NI"/>Once the sage Gautama found out proof against the
<div n="lb"/>chastity of his own wife and enraged at this commanded
<div n="lb"/>his son Cirakārī to chop off the head of the latter's
<div n="lb"/>mother. Giving this command Gautama went into the
<div n="lb"/>forest and Cirakārī in obedience to his father's order
<div n="lb"/>came before his mother, weapon in hand. He did not
<div n="lb"/>kill her immediately but pondered over the consequences
<div n="lb"/>of the deed. Matricide is a great sin, he mused. Then
<div n="lb"/>again who would be there to look after father if mother
<div n="lb"/>died. Perhaps his father, when he cools down, might
<div n="lb"/>regret his command and come back repentant. Thus
<div n="lb"/>he was sitting undecided when Gautama returned full
<div n="lb"/>of remorse for his hasty order. On seeing his wife
[Page183-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>alive he was greatly relieved and immensely happy and
<div n="lb"/>he blessed Cirakārī. (Chapter 266, Śānti Parva).
