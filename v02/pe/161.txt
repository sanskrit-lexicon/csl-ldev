ALAKANANDĀ¦. River Gaṅgā of devaloka. The river
<div n="lb"/>gaṅgā of the earth when it flows through devaloka is
<div n="lb"/>called Alakanandā and is called Vaitaraṇī when it flows
<div n="lb"/>through Pitṛloka (nether world). Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana
<div n="lb"/>(Vyāsa) declares that Deva Gaṅgā with crystal pure
<div n="lb"/>water flowing in devaloka under the name Alakanandā
<div n="lb"/>and Vaitaraṇī of the nether world, a terror to sinners,
<div n="lb"/>are the same as the Gaṅgā of the earth. (Ślokas 21 and
<div n="lb"/>22, Chapter 170, Bhāṣā Bhārata, A.P.).
<div n="NI"/>Starting from Viṣṇupāda Alakanandā flows through
<div n="lb"/>Devayāna which blazes with the splendour of a crore of
<div n="lb"/>beautiful many-storeyed buildings. Flowing from there
<div n="lb"/>to Candramaṇḍala (moon) and flooding it completely
<div n="lb"/>flows down to Brahmaloka. From there it divides into
<div n="lb"/>four rivulets and flows to the four different sides with
<div n="lb"/>the names Sītā, Cakṣus, Alakanandā and Bhadrā. Of
<div n="lb"/>these Sītā falls on the thickly wooded mountain tops of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru and flowing from there through Gandha-
<div n="lb"/>mādana by the side of Bhadrāśvavarṣa falls down in the
<div n="lb"/>eastern ocean. Cakṣus falls on the top of Mālyavān
<div n="lb"/>mountain and flowing through Ketumāla falls down in
<div n="lb"/>the western ocean. The most sacred of the group,
<div n="lb"/>Alakanandā, falls on the mountain of Hemakūṭa and
<div n="lb"/>from there flows through Bhāratavarṣa and falls down
<div n="lb"/>in the southern ocean. The fourth, Bhadrā, falling on
<div n="lb"/>the top of the Mountain, Sṛṅgavān flows to the northern
<div n="lb"/>ocean. Of these the most sacred is Alakanandā which
<div n="lb"/>flows through Bhāratavarṣa and it is believed that even
<div n="lb"/>those who think of taking a bath in that will acquire the
<div n="lb"/>benefit of performing yāgas like Aśvamedha and Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>sūya. (Eighth Skandha of Śrī Mahādevībhāgavata).
