PĀŚIVĀṬA¦. A place of habitation in ancient India.
(M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 64).
<div n="NI"/>PAŚUBHŪMI. The country of Nepal. The place got
the name of Paśubhūmi because it is located near the
birth place of Paśupati (Śiva). (Chapter 30, Śloka 9,
Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>PAŚUDĀ. A female follower of Subrahmaṇya. (Śloka
28, Chapter 46, Śalya Parva).
<div n="NI"/>PĀŚUPATA I. An aged brahmin. (See under Virūpākṣa).
<div n="NI"/>PĀŚUPATA. II. The missile of Śiva. Arjuna during
his exile in the forests performed penance to propitiate
Śiva and got this missile from him.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva has a bow named Pināka. Pāśupata is the arrow
that is used on that bow. Pināka is a serpent with the
colours of a rainbow. It has seven heads and has fierce
canine teeth. Poison flows from them always. The string
of the bow is wound round the neck of Śiva. The
arrow, bright like the sun and equal to the fire of
death, is the Pāśupata. It will burn all that it touches.
Neither Nārāyaṇāstra, Brahmāstra, Āgneyāstra nor
Vāruṇāstra can stand against this. In times of old Śiva
burnt the Tripuras (three cities of the notorious three
demons) by this arrow. Even Brahmā and Viṣṇu could
be killed by Pāśupata. (Chapter 14, Anuśāsana Parva).
Devotees worship Pāśupata as a deity. If the Pāśupata
mantra is recited once it will remove all obstacles from
the way and if recited a hundred times it will end all
your calamities and bring success in any war for you.
<div n="NI"/>PĀŚUPATA(S). The bhūtagaṇas (Spirits and devils
attending on him) of Śiva as a class are called Pāśu-
patas. (Chapter 67, Vāmana Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>PAŚUSAKHA. Husband of Gaṇḍā, servant-maid of
the saptarṣis. (See under Saptarṣis).
<div n="NI"/>PAṬACCARA. A place of habitation in ancient Bhā-
rata. During Purāṇic times the people of this place mig-
rated to south India because they were afraid of Jarā-
sandha. (Chapter 14, Sabhā Parva). Sahadeva, one of
the Pāṇḍavas during his victory tour of the south, sub-
dued the people of this place. The paṭaccaras fought
against the Kauravas on the side of the Pāṇḍavas.
(Chapter 31, Sabhā Parva). It was the paṭaccaras who
stood at the back of the Krauñca Vyūha constructed
by the Pāṇḍavas. (Chapter 50, Bhīṣma Parva).
