ŚUNAKA IV¦. A Maharṣi. In the Purāṇas it is said
<div n="lb"/>that Sūta read Purāṇas in an assembly at which
<div n="lb"/>Śaunaka and others had been present in Naimiṣāraṇya.
<div n="lb"/>There are two inferences about this Śaunaka. In
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha we find that the sage Gṛtsa-
<div n="lb"/>mada who belonged to Bhṛguvaṃśa had a son named
<div n="lb"/>Śunaka and this Śunaka's son was named Śaunaka. A
<div n="lb"/>son named Śunaka was born to King Ruru by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Pramadvarā. Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 5
<div n="lb"/>mentions that this Śunaka was an exceptionally brilliant
<div n="lb"/>scholar in Vedas and Śāstras and was the grandfather
<div n="lb"/>of Śaunaka. Ruru's son, Śunaka was a member of
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>4, Verse 10).
