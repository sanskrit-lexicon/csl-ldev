ŚUNAKA IV¦. A Maharṣi. In the Purāṇas it is said
that Sūta read Purāṇas in an assembly at which
Śaunaka and others had been present in Naimiṣāraṇya.
There are two inferences about this Śaunaka. In
Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha we find that the sage Gṛtsa-
mada who belonged to Bhṛguvaṃśa had a son named
Śunaka and this Śunaka's son was named Śaunaka. A
son named Śunaka was born to King Ruru by his wife
Pramadvarā. Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 5
mentions that this Śunaka was an exceptionally brilliant
scholar in Vedas and Śāstras and was the grandfather
of Śaunaka. Ruru's son, Śunaka was a member of
Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter
4, Verse 10).
