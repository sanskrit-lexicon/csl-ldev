ANUVINDA I¦. One of the 100 sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
There is a story in the Mahābhārata about his being
imprisoned along with Duryodhana. Knowing that the
Pāṇḍavas were living in the forest in all comfort and
happiness Duryodhana and others went in procession to
them. Anuvinda also was in the procession. While
Duryodhana and party were staying in a tent in the
forest, a Gandharva named Citrasena appeared on the
scene and imprisoned them. Anuvinda too was im-
prisoned. (See Citrasena). (M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter
242, Verse 8). He was killed in war by Bhīmasena.
