PĀṆḌAVAS¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Śantanu, a celebrated King of Candravaṃśa
<div n="lb"/>(lunar dynasty) had two wives, Gaṅgā and Satyavatī.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma was the son of Gaṅgā. After the birth of Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā his mother went to heaven. After that Śantanu
<div n="lb"/>married Satyavatī, mother of Vyāsa. Satyavatī got two
<div n="lb"/>sons, Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya. Even while a
<div n="lb"/>bachelor, Citrāṅgada was killed by a Gandharva of
<div n="lb"/>the same name. So Vicitravīrya became King on
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu's death. Bhīṣma forcibly brought the three
<div n="lb"/>daughters of the King of Kāśī named Ambā, Ambikā
<div n="lb"/>and Ambālikā for Vicitravīrya to marry. But knowing
<div n="lb"/>that Ambā was in love with the King of Sālva, Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>let her off on the way. Ambikā and Ambālikā became
<div n="lb"/>the wives of Vicitravīrya. But for a long time they had
<div n="lb"/>no sons.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Satyavatī, mother of Vicitravīrya, sent
<div n="lb"/>for Vyāsa her eldest son and asked him to beget sons
<div n="lb"/>of Ambikā and Ambālikā. Ambikā got Dhṛtarāṣṭra of
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa and Ambālikā, Pāṇḍu, father of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra was born blind and he married Gāndhārī.
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu was born pale-white in colour and he married
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī mother of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>Kuntī was the sister of Vasudeva, father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The real name of Kuntī was Pṛthā. Śūrasena, King of
<div n="lb"/>the Yādavas, was the father of Kuntī and Vasudeva.
<div n="lb"/>Because Kuntibhoja son of Sūrasena's sister, had no
<div n="lb"/>issues Kuntī was sent to the palace of Kuntibhoja and
<div n="lb"/>she grew up there. Pṛthā got the name of Kuntī be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of that. Besides Kuntī, Pāṇḍu had another wife
<div n="lb"/>named Mādrī.
[Page562-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>While she was living in the palace of Kuntibhoja the
<div n="lb"/>sage Durvāsas came and stayed in the palace as the
<div n="lb"/>king's guest. Kuntī was a little girl then and yet she
<div n="lb"/>served the sage with such care, patience and devo-
<div n="lb"/>tion that the sage was greatly pleased with her and gave
<div n="lb"/>her a divine mantra. He said: “If you call upon any
<div n="lb"/>god repeating this mantra he will manifest himself to
<div n="lb"/>you and bless you with a son equal to him in glory and
<div n="lb"/>valour. You can use this only five times.” The impa-
<div n="lb"/>tient curiosity of youth made Kuntī give a test to the
<div n="lb"/>power of the mantra and though unmarried she invoked
<div n="lb"/>the Sun. The Sun immediately presented himself be-
<div n="lb"/>fore her and by his grace she conceived and got a son
<div n="lb"/>whom she secretly set afloat in a river. A childless
<div n="lb"/>charioteer named Adhiratha happened to see the child
<div n="lb"/>and he took it home and brought it up. When he grew
<div n="lb"/>up he was sent to Hastināpura and the sons of Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra took him in their service. He was Karṇa, the
<div n="lb"/>celebrated warrior of the Kauravas. Kuntī married
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu after the birth of Karṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra got of Gāndhārī a hundred sons and a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Duśśalā. The children of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>were known as Kauravas or Dhārtarāṣṭras. Pāṇḍu had
<div n="lb"/>a curse that he would die the moment he entered
<div n="lb"/>into sexual sport with his wives. (See under Kindama).
<div n="lb"/>So under instructions from her husband Kuntī invoked
<div n="lb"/>Dharma, Vāyu and Indra and got the sons Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīmasena and Arjuna. She gave the remaining one
<div n="lb"/>chance to Mādrī and Mādrī invoked the two Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas, Nāsatya and Dasra and got two sons named
<div n="lb"/>Nakula and Sahadeva. All these five were accepted as
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Pāṇḍu and so they got the name of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. (Upto Chapter 123, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Life in Hastināpura and the lac-palace incident.%} After the
<div n="lb"/>birth of the Pāṇḍavas, Pāṇḍu with his wife and child-
<div n="lb"/>ren spent a very long time in the forest of Śataśṛṅga.
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, the royal priest of Vasudeva, performed the
<div n="lb"/>Upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread) and
<div n="lb"/>such other religious ceremonies ordained for boyhood.
<div n="lb"/>They were educated under the sage Śuka. One day in
<div n="lb"/>the Spring season Pāṇḍu's resolution broke down
<div n="lb"/>under the exhilarating influence of the season and he
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of Mādrī and embraced her despite ear-
<div n="lb"/>nest and repeated protests from Mādrī. At once
<div n="lb"/>the curse of the sage took effect and Pāṇḍu fell
<div n="lb"/>dead. It was the custom then that the wife should end
<div n="lb"/>her life in the funeral pyre of her husband and so
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī and Mādrī came forward to do so. But Mādrī
<div n="lb"/>said that one of them should live to take care of the
<div n="lb"/>children and so entrusting her children also to the care
<div n="lb"/>of Kuntī, Mādrī jumped into the funeral pyre and
<div n="lb"/>ended her life. The sages of the Śataśṛṅga forest took
<div n="lb"/>the children and Kuntī to Hastināpura and handing
<div n="lb"/>them over to the charge of Dhṛtarāṣṭra came back.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas grew up in Hastināpura along with the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas. But there was no real affection or intimacy
<div n="lb"/>between them. The naturally strong Bhīma found it a
<div n="lb"/>sport to tease and torment the Kauravas whenever he
<div n="lb"/>got an opportunity. Gradually as the teasings of Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>became unbearable a wicked thought of somehow put-
<div n="lb"/>ting an end to Bhīma's life found place in the minds
<div n="lb"/>of the Kauravas. They once poisoned Bhīma and bind-
<div n="lb"/>ing him tight with ropes threw him into the ocean. But
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma went to the world of the Nāgas and came back
[Page563-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>unscathed with added siddhis (acquired power). This
<div n="lb"/>annoyed the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that Droṇa a renowned preceptor
<div n="lb"/>in archery, came to Hastināpura. Bhīṣma enrolled the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas as disciples of Droṇa. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>became an extraordinarily brilliant bow-man. This came
<div n="lb"/>off as another reason for the Kauravas to drift away
<div n="lb"/>from the Pāṇḍavas. After the end of their course of
<div n="lb"/>education a contest was held in which Arjuna ranked
<div n="lb"/>first. The time came for Gurudakṣiṇ (fees paid in
<div n="lb"/>bulk at the end of the studies to a preceptor). Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>asked his disciples to bring king Drupada bound hand
<div n="lb"/>and foot before him. The Kauravas failed in that
<div n="lb"/>mission and the Pāṇḍavas under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna fulfilled the demand of their Guru.
<div n="NI"/>When the training and Gurudakṣiṇā were over, Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra crowned Yudhiṣṭhira as the heir-apparent and
<div n="lb"/>this increased the power and status of the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>in Hastināpura. The jealousy of Duryodhana knew no
<div n="lb"/>bounds when he found the Pāṇḍavas in the pinnacle of
<div n="lb"/>power and popularity. He decided to kill them. He
<div n="lb"/>therefore, built a new palace in a place called Vāraṇā-
<div n="lb"/>vata and with the permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra made
<div n="lb"/>them change their residence to the new building.
<div n="lb"/>The new building was cunningly built of lac and
<div n="lb"/>other combustible material. The wise and intelligent
<div n="lb"/>Vidura knew this deceit beforehand and so he had
<div n="lb"/>warned the Pāṇḍavas of the danger through a messen-
<div n="lb"/>ger named Khanaka. The Pāṇḍavas had, therefore,
<div n="lb"/>made ready a secret passage by underground to es-
<div n="lb"/>cape from the building when an emergency arose. The
<div n="lb"/>passage was to lead them from the palace to the forest
<div n="lb"/>nearby. One night Purocana, a minister of Duryodhana,
<div n="lb"/>came stealthily and set fire to the palace. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>with their mother Kuntī escaped from the palace to the
<div n="lb"/>forest nearby. That night a huntress and her five sons
<div n="lb"/>were sleeping in a part of the building and they were
<div n="lb"/>burnt to death. They were all sleeping fully drunk and
<div n="lb"/>so could not escape from the building. Purocana also
<div n="lb"/>was burnt to death. Thus the Pāṇḍavas had to go
<div n="lb"/>away from Hastināpura for a brief period.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Exile and its end.%} The Kauravas thought that
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas died in the fire and in that belief conducted
<div n="lb"/>the funeral rites of their brothers. The Pāṇḍavas after
<div n="lb"/>their escape from the fire walked a long distance
<div n="lb"/>through the forests and came to the banks of the river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā. On their way a demon named Hiḍimba attack-
<div n="lb"/>ed them and Bhīma killed him but at the request of
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra married his sister Hiḍimbī. After that
<div n="lb"/>while they were continuing their journey crossing the
<div n="lb"/>river a Gandharva of name Citraratha attacked them.
<div n="lb"/>Citraratha was defeated in a battle and he later became
<div n="lb"/>friendly with the Pāṇḍavas. He gave them many valuable
<div n="lb"/>presents and also narrated to them the story of Tapatī-
<div n="lb"/>saṃvaraṇa. Then they went and stayed in the house of
<div n="lb"/>a brahmin in the village of Ekacakrā. It was at that
<div n="lb"/>time that the Svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī was held. The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas went for the Svayaṃvara and married
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī. The news then spread that Pāṇḍavas were not
<div n="lb"/>dead but still alive. Dhṛtarāṣṭra then sent for them and
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas returned to their palace in Hastināpura.
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira was crowned as King of half of the country
<div n="lb"/>and he built his palace in a place known as Khāṇḍava-
<div n="lb"/>prastha. The palace was designed and built by a demon
<div n="lb"/>named Maya with beautiful Crystals and costly diamonds.
[Page563-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>When the Pāṇḍavas were living there Nārada
<div n="lb"/>went to them once. He suggested that Pāñcālī should
<div n="lb"/>remain as wife to the Pāṇḍavas in turn, one year each
<div n="lb"/>to one of them. They accepted the suggestion and
<div n="lb"/>started living like that. Yudhiṣṭhira married Devikā,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of King Śibi, also. (Śloka 70, Chapter 95, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva). Bhīmasena and Arjuna with the help of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa slew Jarāsandha. After that they conducted a
<div n="lb"/>victory march over the country and established their
<div n="lb"/>overlordship by conducting successfully a Rājasūya yajña.
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana and his brothers once visited Indraprastha,
<div n="lb"/>the palace of the Pāṇḍavas. They were fooled at the
<div n="lb"/>palace and this enraged them. Duryodhana invited
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra for a game of dice and the latter lost
<div n="lb"/>everything. Yet Dhṛtarāṣṭra gave them back everything
<div n="lb"/>and sent them to Indraprastha again. Before Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra reached the palace Duryodhana once again
<div n="lb"/>challenged him for a game of dice. Despite protests
<div n="lb"/>from all sides Dharmaputra went and played and lost
<div n="lb"/>again everything. To fulfil the conditions of the game
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira went to the forests with his brothers and
<div n="lb"/>wife to spend twelve years in exile and a year incog-
<div n="lb"/>nito. At that time Kuntī lived with Vidura.
<div n="NI"/>It was during this period of exile that the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>got the Akṣayapātra (never-empty pot) from the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>They dwelt first in Dvaitavana and then in Kāmya-
<div n="lb"/>kavana. Then they went to the mountain of Gandha-
<div n="lb"/>mādana and from there to Badarikāśrama. From
<div n="lb"/>there they came back again to Kāmyakavana and
<div n="lb"/>while they were living there Duryodhana and his men
<div n="lb"/>went to that forest to see the sufferings of the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and gloat on their sad plight. But Citrasena, a Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharva, captured Duryodhana and Arjuna got him
<div n="lb"/>released. Duryodhana sent Durvāsas to tease Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra but the sage was sent back after being received
<div n="lb"/>duly and well-attended to earn his blessings. During
<div n="lb"/>their stay in that forest Jayadratha kidnapped Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>but the Pāṇḍavas rescued her immediately. They went
<div n="lb"/>from there again to Dvaitavana. Dharmadeva tested
<div n="lb"/>them once while they were there. The twelve years of
<div n="lb"/>exile came to an end and as per directions from Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>deva they spent their incognito period of one year in
<div n="lb"/>the court of the King of Virāṭa. After the end of their
<div n="lb"/>incognito life the King of Virāṭa gave in marriage his
<div n="lb"/>daughter Uttarā to Abhimanyu son of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>Even after the return of the Pāṇḍavas from the
<div n="lb"/>forests after successfully fulfilling the conditions of the
<div n="lb"/>game, Duryodhana showed obstinate reluctance to part
<div n="lb"/>with even five pin-points of land in favour of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. A peace mission of Śrī Kṛṣṇa from the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas to avoid a war and settle matters amicably to
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra failed and the stage was set for a great
<div n="lb"/>battle between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ascension to Heaven.%} A great and grim battle was
<div n="lb"/>fought at Kurukṣetra between the Pāṇḍavas and the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas lasting for eighteen days. Śrī Kṛṣṇa neither
<div n="lb"/>fought nor took arms even once against the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>but acted as the charioteer of Arjuna. When the war
<div n="lb"/>came to an end the Kauravas were completely annihil-
<div n="lb"/>ated.
<div n="NI"/>Yudhiṣṭhira became King. He performed an Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha Yāga. After a few years of reign the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>crowned Parīkṣit, son of Abhimanyu, as the King and
<div n="lb"/>started for their Mahāprasthāna (departing this life).
<div n="lb"/>They walked in a line in the order of their age,
[Page564-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra leading and Pāñcālī following last. At
<div n="lb"/>first Pāñcālī fell dead, but nobody turned back. Then
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva fell and nobody worried. This continued
<div n="lb"/>thus till Dharmaputra was left alone. A dog which
<div n="lb"/>followed them from their very start also remained
<div n="lb"/>alive with Dharmaputra. The dog was none other than
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadeva, father of Dharmaputra. When Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra reached the top of the Himālayas Indra was there
<div n="lb"/>ready with the divine car to take him to heaven. But Dhar-
<div n="lb"/>maputra said that he would not come to heaven leaving
<div n="lb"/>his brothers and wife elsewhere. Then Indra informed
<div n="lb"/>him that they were already in heaven and so Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra went to heaven with Indra. (Only a general and
<div n="lb"/>succinct history of the Pāṇḍavas is given under this
<div n="lb"/>head. For details see under the heads of each of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas as well as Pāñcālī, Kuntī, Bhīṣma and
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa).
