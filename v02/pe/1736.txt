DANTADHVAJA¦. The son of Manu Tāmasa. Once
Daṇḍadhvaja gave as oblation his flesh and blood
in fire, to get children. But it was of no use. So he
put his hair of the body, of the head, his sinews, the
marrow of the bones, and liver and sperm in the fire.
When the sperm was put in the fire there was a voice
‘Don't’ and with that the king fell dead. And instantly
seven luminous children came out from the fire. They
began to cry aloud. Hearing their cry Brahmā came
there and anointed them as the Maruts (wind gods).
They were the maruts of Tāmasamanvantara. (Vāmana
Purāṇa, Chapter 72).
