DANTADHVAJA¦. The son of Manu Tāmasa. Once
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍadhvaja gave as oblation his flesh and blood
<div n="lb"/>in fire, to get children. But it was of no use. So he
<div n="lb"/>put his hair of the body, of the head, his sinews, the
<div n="lb"/>marrow of the bones, and liver and sperm in the fire.
<div n="lb"/>When the sperm was put in the fire there was a voice
<div n="lb"/>‘Don't’ and with that the king fell dead. And instantly
<div n="lb"/>seven luminous children came out from the fire. They
<div n="lb"/>began to cry aloud. Hearing their cry Brahmā came
<div n="lb"/>there and anointed them as the Maruts (wind gods).
<div n="lb"/>They were the maruts of Tāmasamanvantara. (Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 72).
