AYODHYĀ¦. A city in North India which enjoyed great
<div n="lb"/>importance and reputation for many years as the capi-
<div n="lb"/>tal of the Kings of the solar dynasty. (See Ikṣvāku
<div n="lb"/>dynasty). All the Kings of this dynasty ruled the coun-
<div n="lb"/>try from this city as their capital. Vasiṣṭha, the great
<div n="lb"/>preceptor of the Ikṣvāku Rājas, came to Ayodhyā dur-
<div n="lb"/>ing the period of the reign of Kalmāṣapāda, who was
<div n="lb"/>the thirty-fifth ruler in succession to Ikṣvāku. A quarrel
<div n="lb"/>broke out between Kalmāṣapāda and Vasiṣṭha during
<div n="lb"/>a hunting expedition, and Vasiṣṭha cursed the King
<div n="lb"/>and as the result the latter became a Rākṣasa. After
<div n="lb"/>regaining his former form as King, he apologised to
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and they became friends again. At the requ-
<div n="lb"/>est of the King in the interests of his dynasty Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>came to Ayodhyā, and the people were greatly elated.
<div n="lb"/>A son was born to Vasiṣṭha by Kalmāṣapāda's wife and
<div n="lb"/>that son was Aśmaka. After that Vasiṣṭha used to go to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā frequently and was installed as family precep-
<div n="lb"/>tor of the Ikṣvākus. Till the time of Śrī Rāma the city
<div n="lb"/>of Ayodhyā maintained its pomp and glory, and after
<div n="lb"/>that gradually its decay and fall set in. Laudatory refe-
<div n="lb"/>rences to the city are found in most of the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>like the Mahābhārata, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa etc. (See
<div n="lb"/>Kosala).
