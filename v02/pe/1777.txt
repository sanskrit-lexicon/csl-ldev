<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} This country had been divided
<div n="lb"/>into two, Eastern Daśārṇa and Western Daśārṇa. The
<div n="lb"/>modern Patna and the surrounding places comprised
<div n="lb"/>Eastern Daśārṇa and the places of Malva, the Western
<div n="lb"/>Daśārṇa. Some are of opinion that Daśārṇa comprises
<div n="lb"/>the South-East part of the Vindhya mountain. It is men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in ‘Meghadūta’ that Vidiśā was the capital of
<div n="lb"/>Daśārṇa. The modern name of Vidiśā is Bhilsā.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Other information regarding Daśārṇa.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,

<div n="NI"/>(4) King Sudāmā ruled over the country of Daśārṇa.

<div n="lb"/>of Hiraṇyavarmā. The king of Daśārṇa who had been
