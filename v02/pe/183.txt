AMARAKAṆṬAKA¦. A mountain. It was on this
<div n="lb"/>mountain that some parts of Tripura, which was burnt
<div n="lb"/>by Śiva fell. From that time it became a holy place. In
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa, Ādi Khaṇḍa, Chapter 15, we see the
<div n="lb"/>following passage about the benefits obtained by visit-
<div n="lb"/>ing this holy place. “One who goes to Amarakaṇṭaka
<div n="lb"/>mountain will enjoy the fourteen worlds for thirtyseven
<div n="lb"/>thousand crores of years. Afterwards he will be born on
<div n="lb"/>earth as King and reign as supreme emperor. A visit to
<div n="lb"/>Amarakaṇṭaka has ten times the value of an Aśvamedha.
<div n="lb"/>If one has Śiva's darśana there, one will attain Svarga.
<div n="lb"/>At the time of eclipse, all kinds of holy things converge
<div n="lb"/>towards Amarakaṇṭaka. Those who take their bath in
<div n="lb"/>Jvāleśvara in Amarakaṇṭaka will enter Svarga. The
<div n="lb"/>dead will have no rebirth. Those who renounce their
<div n="lb"/>lives at Jvāleśvara will live in Rudraloka till the time of
<div n="lb"/>great Deluge. In the valley of Amarakaṇṭaka and in the
<div n="lb"/>Tirtha live Devas known as Amaras and numerous Ṛṣis.
<div n="lb"/>Amarakaṇṭaka Kṣetra has a circumference of one yojana.
<div n="lb"/>(about eight miles).
