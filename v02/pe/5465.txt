PUNARJANMA¦. It is the theory that the soul of a man
is born again after his death. The Purāṇas and Vedas
contain many statements regarding this of which the
following are a few:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%What is Death?%} When the Jīvātmā (soul) of an
individual leaves his body with all its upādhis (attri-
butes and adjuncts) it is called Death. By upādhis are
meant the following four things. (i) Mind and the senses.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The five Prāṇas namely Prāṇa, Apāna, Udāna, Vyāna
and Samāna. (iii) The Sūkṣmaśarīra, that is, the Prāṇa-
manovijñānakośasaṅghāta (the subtle body that is invi-
sible with the grosser elements). (iv) Karman (action).
All these four things follow the soul even after his death.
Only when the soul attains mokṣa (salvation) do the
upādhis leave it. It is the life breath Udāna that guides
the soul out of the body. It is the Sūkṣmaśarīra that
gives heat to the body while there is life and that is
why when the soul leaves the body with the upādhis the
body becomes cold.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%After death.%} When the soul leaves the body with the
upādhis it becomes active again and its activities and
movements depend upon the actions of the soul while
living. The spiritual actions of the individual are
classified into three.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Aparabrahmopāsana.%} He who has done all his deeds
according to scriptural injunctions is said to be one who
has done upāsana of aparabrahma. When such an
individual dies his soul with all the upādhis attains
Candra. He goes to Candra through dhūma (smoke),
rātri (night), Kṛṣṇapakṣa (the dark fortnight), dakṣiṇā-
yanakāla (the sun's passage south of the equator),
pitṛloka (world of the manes) and Ākāśa (ether). He
enjoys the rewards of the deeds done on earth there
and reserving some to be enjoyed or suffered in his
next birth the soul with the upādhis comes back to
earth to enter another body. The soul comes back to
earth through ether, vāyu, dhūma, megha, varṣa, vrīhi,
yava, auṣadhi, vṛkṣa, Tila, Puruṣabīja and strīgarbha.
When the Jīvātmā goes to Candra its padārthatva
(attribute) diminishes gradually and when it comes back
to earth it increases gradually. Thus the jīvātmā takes
[Page614-a+ 64]
thousands of births going to and from the moon. The
jīvātmā coming back from the moon evolves from a
plant to man. Plants are the food of man and the soul
entering the plant enters the puruṣabīja (semen virile)
through food. The souls coming out as rebirths do
accept wombs according to a definite principle. In
the order of the merit of their good deeds on earth
they are born in Brahmin, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya or Śūdra
wombs. The souls with great sins are born as worms and
insects. This passage of the soul from earth to Candra
and vice versa is called Pitṛyāna.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Aparavidyopāsana.%} There are some people who do
not consider performance of religious rites as important
but worship Brahman. They do not treat Brahman and
jīvātmā as one but view them as separate entities.
Such devotees are called Aparavidyopāsakas. Their souls
as soon as they leave the body move towards apara-
brahman. The path to aparabrahma is through Agni,
Jyotis, daytime, Śuklapakṣa (the white fortnight),
Uttarāyaṇa (the passage of the sun to the north), samvat-
sara (year), Sūrya (sun), Candra (moon) and Vidyut
(lightning). The dhanyas (blessed ones) who attain
Vidyut go to Varuṇaloka, Indraloka and Prajāpatiloka
and then merge with parabrahma (the supreme being).
This path is called Devayāna. Since for both Pitṛyāna
and Devayāna the jīvātmā has to depend upon Candra
it is to be surmised that there is some special connection
between jīvātmā and Candra. Those who attain Apara-
brahma by the path of devayāna do not come back to
earth. They have no rebirths. Those who have merged
with aparabrahma attain Brahman by the end of a life-
time of Brahmā. Thus those who attain Brahman and
do not believe that jīvātmā and Brahman are one
and view them separately attain Parabrahma through
the merger with aparabrahma. This is called Krama-
mukti. Some sages are of opinion that those who attain
aparabrahma enjoy prosperity by mind. Those who
live attached to worldly pleasures but not do things
prohibited by the Vedas attain Pitṛloka by the path of
Dakṣiṇāyana. After enjoying all the accrued ‘puṇya’
there, they come back again to earth to be born
again.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Pāpopāsana.%} The jīvātmā of one who does not
follow the injunctions of śāstras correctly does not
attain Candraloka. It is born again as pests and insects
attaining a place called Tṛtīya. There is no evidence
in the Purāṇas of their attaining mokṣa. How
a soul subjected to rebirths attains mokṣa is described
under ‘Mokṣa’. (Chāndogya Upaniṣad, Gītā, Bhāga-
vata, Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad).
