PUNARJANMA¦. It is the theory that the soul of a man
<div n="lb"/>is born again after his death. The Purāṇas and Vedas
<div n="lb"/>contain many statements regarding this of which the
<div n="lb"/>following are a few:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%What is Death?%} When the Jīvātmā (soul) of an
<div n="lb"/>individual leaves his body with all its upādhis (attri-
<div n="lb"/>butes and adjuncts) it is called Death. By upādhis are
<div n="lb"/>meant the following four things. (i) Mind and the senses.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The five Prāṇas namely Prāṇa, Apāna, Udāna, Vyāna
<div n="lb"/>and Samāna. (iii) The Sūkṣmaśarīra, that is, the Prāṇa-
<div n="lb"/>manovijñānakośasaṅghāta (the subtle body that is invi-
<div n="lb"/>sible with the grosser elements). (iv) Karman (action).
<div n="lb"/>All these four things follow the soul even after his death.
<div n="lb"/>Only when the soul attains mokṣa (salvation) do the
<div n="lb"/>upādhis leave it. It is the life breath Udāna that guides
<div n="lb"/>the soul out of the body. It is the Sūkṣmaśarīra that
<div n="lb"/>gives heat to the body while there is life and that is
<div n="lb"/>why when the soul leaves the body with the upādhis the
<div n="lb"/>body becomes cold.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%After death.%} When the soul leaves the body with the
<div n="lb"/>upādhis it becomes active again and its activities and
<div n="lb"/>movements depend upon the actions of the soul while
<div n="lb"/>living. The spiritual actions of the individual are
<div n="lb"/>classified into three.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Aparabrahmopāsana.%} He who has done all his deeds
<div n="lb"/>according to scriptural injunctions is said to be one who
<div n="lb"/>has done upāsana of aparabrahma. When such an
<div n="lb"/>individual dies his soul with all the upādhis attains
<div n="lb"/>Candra. He goes to Candra through dhūma (smoke),
<div n="lb"/>rātri (night), Kṛṣṇapakṣa (the dark fortnight), dakṣiṇā-
<div n="lb"/>yanakāla (the sun's passage south of the equator),
<div n="lb"/>pitṛloka (world of the manes) and Ākāśa (ether). He
<div n="lb"/>enjoys the rewards of the deeds done on earth there
<div n="lb"/>and reserving some to be enjoyed or suffered in his
<div n="lb"/>next birth the soul with the upādhis comes back to
<div n="lb"/>earth to enter another body. The soul comes back to
<div n="lb"/>earth through ether, vāyu, dhūma, megha, varṣa, vrīhi,
<div n="lb"/>yava, auṣadhi, vṛkṣa, Tila, Puruṣabīja and strīgarbha.
<div n="lb"/>When the Jīvātmā goes to Candra its padārthatva
<div n="lb"/>(attribute) diminishes gradually and when it comes back
<div n="lb"/>to earth it increases gradually. Thus the jīvātmā takes
[Page614-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>thousands of births going to and from the moon. The
<div n="lb"/>jīvātmā coming back from the moon evolves from a
<div n="lb"/>plant to man. Plants are the food of man and the soul
<div n="lb"/>entering the plant enters the puruṣabīja (semen virile)
<div n="lb"/>through food. The souls coming out as rebirths do
<div n="lb"/>accept wombs according to a definite principle. In
<div n="lb"/>the order of the merit of their good deeds on earth
<div n="lb"/>they are born in Brahmin, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya or Śūdra
<div n="lb"/>wombs. The souls with great sins are born as worms and
<div n="lb"/>insects. This passage of the soul from earth to Candra
<div n="lb"/>and vice versa is called Pitṛyāna.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Aparavidyopāsana.%} There are some people who do
<div n="lb"/>not consider performance of religious rites as important
<div n="lb"/>but worship Brahman. They do not treat Brahman and
<div n="lb"/>jīvātmā as one but view them as separate entities.
<div n="lb"/>Such devotees are called Aparavidyopāsakas. Their souls
<div n="lb"/>as soon as they leave the body move towards apara-
<div n="lb"/>brahman. The path to aparabrahma is through Agni,
<div n="lb"/>Jyotis, daytime, Śuklapakṣa (the white fortnight),
<div n="lb"/>Uttarāyaṇa (the passage of the sun to the north), samvat-
<div n="lb"/>sara (year), Sūrya (sun), Candra (moon) and Vidyut
<div n="lb"/>(lightning). The dhanyas (blessed ones) who attain
<div n="lb"/>Vidyut go to Varuṇaloka, Indraloka and Prajāpatiloka
<div n="lb"/>and then merge with parabrahma (the supreme being).
<div n="lb"/>This path is called Devayāna. Since for both Pitṛyāna
<div n="lb"/>and Devayāna the jīvātmā has to depend upon Candra
<div n="lb"/>it is to be surmised that there is some special connection
<div n="lb"/>between jīvātmā and Candra. Those who attain Apara-
<div n="lb"/>brahma by the path of devayāna do not come back to
<div n="lb"/>earth. They have no rebirths. Those who have merged
<div n="lb"/>with aparabrahma attain Brahman by the end of a life-
<div n="lb"/>time of Brahmā. Thus those who attain Brahman and
<div n="lb"/>do not believe that jīvātmā and Brahman are one
<div n="lb"/>and view them separately attain Parabrahma through
<div n="lb"/>the merger with aparabrahma. This is called Krama-
<div n="lb"/>mukti. Some sages are of opinion that those who attain
<div n="lb"/>aparabrahma enjoy prosperity by mind. Those who
<div n="lb"/>live attached to worldly pleasures but not do things
<div n="lb"/>prohibited by the Vedas attain Pitṛloka by the path of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣiṇāyana. After enjoying all the accrued ‘puṇya’
<div n="lb"/>there, they come back again to earth to be born
<div n="lb"/>again.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Pāpopāsana.%} The jīvātmā of one who does not
<div n="lb"/>follow the injunctions of śāstras correctly does not
<div n="lb"/>attain Candraloka. It is born again as pests and insects
<div n="lb"/>attaining a place called Tṛtīya. There is no evidence
<div n="lb"/>in the Purāṇas of their attaining mokṣa. How
<div n="lb"/>a soul subjected to rebirths attains mokṣa is described
<div n="lb"/>under ‘Mokṣa’. (Chāndogya Upaniṣad, Gītā, Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad).
