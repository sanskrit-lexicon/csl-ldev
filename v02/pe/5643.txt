RAKTAJA¦. A form assumed by Arjuna in his previous
<div n="lb"/>birth. The following story is told in Padma Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 14) about Arjuna being reborn as such at the
<div n="lb"/>meeting of Kali and Dvāpara yugas and Svedaja being
<div n="lb"/>born as Karṇa during the same period.
<div n="NI"/>Once during a quarrel between Śiva and Brahmā the
<div n="lb"/>former nipped off Brahmā's head. (For details see under
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā). Some drops of sweat appeared on the fore-
<div n="lb"/>head of the angry Brahmā, and from the sweat which
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā wiped with his hand arose a person wearing a
<div n="lb"/>thousand shields, bow and quiver. That person was
<div n="lb"/>Svedaja. He asked Brahmā what he should do and
<div n="lb"/>the former granted him permission to destroy Śiva. He
<div n="lb"/>then approached Śiva with bow drawn and the frighten-
<div n="lb"/>ed Śiva ran to Viṣṇu and sought refuge. Svedaja
<div n="lb"/>followed Śiva and when Viṣṇu, seeing him, raised a
<div n="lb"/>loud noise ‘Hum’. Śiva prostrated at Viṣṇu's feet. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>extended the skull in his hand towards Viṣṇu request-
<div n="lb"/>ing something to be given to him. Mahāviṣṇu, who had
<div n="lb"/>nothing else to give Śiva, put his right hand into the
<div n="lb"/>skull as alms, Śiva wounded the hand with his Śūla
<div n="lb"/>(three-pronged weapon) and pure red blood began
<div n="lb"/>flowing from the hand into the skull. The blood con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued flowing for a thousand years in a length of fifty
<div n="lb"/>yojanas and thickness of ten yojanas. At the end of
<div n="lb"/>the period Viṣṇu asked whether the skull was not filled
<div n="lb"/>yet, and looking into the skull with his three eyes Śiva
<div n="lb"/>answered that it was full. Then Viṣṇu stopped the
<div n="lb"/>flow of blood, and Śiva, in the presence of Viṣṇu, looked
<div n="lb"/>into the blood for a thousand years and stirred it with his
<div n="lb"/>hand. The blood gradually turned into a bubble, and
<div n="lb"/>a person possessing thousand hands and as glowing as
<div n="lb"/>fire appeared in the skull. He had a crown on his head
<div n="lb"/>and he held in his hands a bow and quiver. He wore
<div n="lb"/>gloves on his hands. And, that was Raktaja, an in-
<div n="lb"/>carnation of Nararṣi.
<div n="NI"/>Looking at Raktaja, Śiva told Viṣṇu thus: “This master
<div n="lb"/>in archery is Nara. You spoke Nara, and let his name,
<div n="lb"/>therefore be Nara. Oh Nārāyaṇa, you both will be
<div n="lb"/>called Naranārāyaṇas. This Nara will be of help to
<div n="lb"/>you on behalf of the Devas and also in the sustenance
<div n="lb"/>and protection of the world. He will further help you
<div n="lb"/>to kill the asuras. Nara, the great intellectual that he
<div n="lb"/>is, will become a muni, of surpassing wisdom. Brahmā's
<div n="lb"/>divine fifth head possesses so much of effulgence. Nara
<div n="lb"/>is created from that effulgence and also from the blood
<div n="lb"/>from your hands and my look at it. He will annihilate
<div n="lb"/>all enemies in war. He will be a terror to those persons
<div n="lb"/>who cannot be conquered by you, Indra and the other
<div n="lb"/>Devas.
<div n="NI"/>While Viṣṇu stood there amazed Raktaja praised him
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva with folded hands and asked from the skull
[Page630-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>what he should do. Then Śiva ordered him thus:
<div n="lb"/>You kill this asura (Svedaja) created by Brahmā with
<div n="lb"/>his own effulgence.” And Śiva led Raktaja out of the
<div n="lb"/>skull by his hands and told him again:—“Look, here
<div n="lb"/>lies the terrible person I spoke about made unconscious
<div n="lb"/>by the cry of ‘Hum’ by Viṣṇu. Awake him immedia-
<div n="lb"/>tely.” After having said this Śiva disappeared. Nara,
<div n="lb"/>in the presence of Nārāyaṇa, kicked the unconscious
<div n="lb"/>Svedaja with his left foot, and he came out of his un-
<div n="lb"/>conscious state.
<div n="NI"/>The fierce fight that ensued between Raktaja and
<div n="lb"/>Svedaja continued for two years. By then Svedaja had
<div n="lb"/>lost everything but one of his shields and Raktaja had
<div n="lb"/>only his two arms to fight with. At this stage Vāsudeva
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu) in great alarm went and asked Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>whether Raktaja might not kill Svedaja. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>answered, ‘In the next birth Nara may defeat Svedaja’.
<div n="lb"/>Saying ‘Right, let that be so’, Viṣṇu returned to the
<div n="lb"/>battlefield and withdrew them from fighting with the
<div n="lb"/>assurance that they would be given an opportunity to
<div n="lb"/>fight again during the period of the Kali and the
<div n="lb"/>Dvāpara yugas.
<div n="NI"/>Afterwards Viṣṇu directed Āditya (Sun) and Ākhaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍala (Indra) to look after Raktaja and Svedaja. He
<div n="lb"/>told Āditya further:—“At the end of the Dvāpara
<div n="lb"/>yuga you should see that Svedaja is reborn, in the
<div n="lb"/>interests of the Devas, as your son. In the Yadu
<div n="lb"/>dynasty will be born a very powerful fellow called
<div n="lb"/>Śūra and he will have a very beautiful daughter named
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthā. Durvāsas will advise her some mantras as a
<div n="lb"/>boon and she will have some sons from the Devas
<div n="lb"/>whom she will invoke with the mantras. With that
<div n="lb"/>object in view, while in her periods, she would, at the
<div n="lb"/>time of dawn gaze at you with love. Then he (Svedaja)
<div n="lb"/>will be born as the son called Vasuṣeṇa of Kuntī, the
<div n="lb"/>virgin.”
<div n="NI"/>The Sun-God agreed to obey the above instructions of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and told him further:—“I shall procreate in the
<div n="lb"/>virgin a very powerful and valiant son, who will become
<div n="lb"/>well-known in the world as Karṇa. He will gift away
<div n="lb"/>all wealth to brahmins.” After saying this Sūrya dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared.
<div n="NI"/>After this Viṣṇu told Indra as follows:—“You
<div n="lb"/>should, at the end of the Dvāpara yuga see that this
<div n="lb"/>Nara, born from blood, is reborn as an aspect of
<div n="lb"/>yours on earth. King Pāṇḍu will one day go into the
<div n="lb"/>forest with his wives, Kuntī and Mādrī, and he will
<div n="lb"/>then become the object of an animal's curse. He will
<div n="lb"/>therefore, in a spirit of renunciation, go to mount
<div n="lb"/>Śataśṛṅga where he would ask Kuntī to become a
<div n="lb"/>mother by another man. Unwilling to do so Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>will desire to have sons by Devas, and when she prays
<div n="lb"/>to you, you should favour her with this Nara as son.
<div n="NI"/>Devendra raised a legal objection to the above injunc-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Viṣṇu as follows:—“You, who incarnated your-
<div n="lb"/>self as Rāma in the twenty-seventh yuga of the last
<div n="lb"/>Manvantara for the purpose of killing Rāvaṇa, killed
<div n="lb"/>my son Bāli. Therefore I do not wish to procreate
<div n="lb"/>Nara as my son.” To this objection of Indra Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>assured him that as a penalty for the mistake of killing
<div n="lb"/>Bāli, he would be a companion of Nara (Arjuna) who
<div n="lb"/>would be born as Indra's son.
<div n="NI"/>According to the above terms and conditions fighting
<div n="lb"/>between Raktaja and Svedaja ended. In the next
<div n="lb"/>birth Raktaja was born as Arjuna and Svedaja as
[Page631-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated himself as Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The meeting of the three in the battle-field is well-
<div n="lb"/>known.
