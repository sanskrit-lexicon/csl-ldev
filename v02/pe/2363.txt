GARUḌAPURĀṆA¦. One of the eighteen Mahāpurāṇas.
<div n="lb"/>This is believed to be a narration to Garuḍa by
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. There are eight thousand ślokas in it.
<div n="lb"/>There is an opinion that only the Tārkṣyakalpa is of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. The theme of the Purāṇa is the birth of Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmāṇḍa. If this Purāṇa is given as a gift it
<div n="lb"/>should be given along with the image of a swan in
<div n="lb"/>gold. (Chapter 272, Agni Purāṇa).
