DAṆḌĪ II¦. A god. This god is worshipped as a waiter
of the Sun. The sun is consecrated in a chariot of one
wheel, yoked with seven horses, and wearing two lotus
flowers. On the right side of the Sun his waiter Daṇḍī
will be standing as door-keeper with ink and pen in his
hand, and on the left his waiter Piṅgala will be stand-
ing with a stick in his hand. These two gate-keepers
are the two gaṇas of the Sun. (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
ter 51).
