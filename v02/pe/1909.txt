DHANAÑJAYA VI¦. A brahmin devotee of Mahāviṣṇu
who lived in the Tretā yuga. Once, in winter, when
for want of proper clothing he could bear the biting
cold no longer, he broke some twigs of the Aśvattha
tree (poplar leafed fig tree) and made fire to warm
him. When Dhanañjaya broke the twigs it gave reflec-
tive pain on the body of Mahāviṣṇu. But Mahāviṣṇu
who was aware of the unflinching devotion of Dhanañ-
jaya to himself was not displeased but appeared before
Dhanañjaya with wounds all over the body. The
Brahmin enquired how Viṣṇu got the wounds and on
knowing that it was the consequence of his breaking the
twigs of Aśvattha Dhanañjaya in utter grief started to
cut his own head off. Greatly pleased Viṣṇu stopped
him from his attempt and asked him to name a boon.
Very modestly he replied that he would be satisfied if
he was given the strength to continue as a devotee of
Viṣṇu. (Padma Purāṇa, Kriyā Kāṇḍa).
