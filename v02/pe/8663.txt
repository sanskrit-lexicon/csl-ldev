VṚTRA¦ (VṚTRĀSURA). A mighty and fierce asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Reason for his birth.%} Vṛtra was the rebirth of emperor
Citraketu. Citraketu and his wife Kṛtadyuti prayed to
Aṅgiras, as a result of which a son was born to them.
That son died in his infancy. But Aṅgiras brought him
to life again. Brahmā and Nārada taught Citraketu
theosophy. Citraketu sat in contemplation for eight
days and changing himself to a Gandharva he flew
through the sky. As he was flying, he saw Pārvatī sitting
on the thigh of Śiva and laughed aloud. Knowing this
Pārvatī cursed him to become an asura. Vṛtrāsura was
the rebirth of the emperor according to this curse.
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 6).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Two stories are mentioned about the birth of
Vṛtrāsura. One story is that Kaśyapa created him from
fire. The other story is that Vṛtra was the son of Tvaṣṭā.
Both are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Hiraṇyakaśipu was born to Prajāpati Kaśyapa, by
his wife Danu. Mahāviṣṇu killed him on being request-
ed by the Devas. Danu was grieved at the death of her
son. So Kaśyapa gave her another son. He was Vala or
Bala. Indra killed him with his weapon, the thunder-
bolt. Kaśyapa got angry and plucking a hair from his
matted hair, made a burnt offering of it, saying “Let a
son who would be the killer of Indra be born.” Imme-
diately a huge giant, as black as antimony with yellow
eyes was born from the fire. That asura, clad in the
hide of antelope with sword in hand, opening his mouth,
from which two huge tusks protruded, very wide, and
shining with radiance cried out in a voice of thunder,
“Oh! Sage! Order me, what am I to do?”
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa ordered him to kill Indra. He named the
monster Vṛtra. (Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmi Khaṇḍa, Chap-
ter 23).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) It was Prajāpati Tvaṣṭā who created Vṛtra to kill
Indra. He had sufficient reasons for it. From the very
beginning Indra and Tvaṣṭā were enemies. Tvaṣṭā be-
got a son named Triśiras otherwise called Viśvarūpa,
for the purpose of killing Indra. This Viśvarūpa had
three heads. One was meant for drinking Surā (a
liquor), the second for drinking Soma (liquor) and the
third for eating food. Viśvarūpa was a Brāhmaṇa. Still,
as his mother was an asura, he loved the asuras and
mingled with them. Indra knew about the behaviour
of Viśvarūpa. He concluded that it was blasphemy and
wickedness. Indra who was afraid of Viśvarūpa, got
angry and cut off his heads. Of the heads of Viśvarūpa,
that which drank Soma became a bird called Kapiñ-
jala, that which drank Surā became a bird called
Kalapiṅga, and that which ate food became the
bird Tittiri (partridge). Brahmahatyā (the sin of kill-
ing Brahmin) took shape and went against Indra.
Though Indra could have destroyed it, he joined his
[Page884-a+ 65]
hands and received it. At the end of the year he cut it
into four pieces and divided them among earth, water,
tree and woman. The earth received it with the boon
that depressions will be filled. That sin is now seen as
salt beds. Water got it with the boon, “Will be swollen
when joined”. That sin is foam and bubbles. The tree
got it with the boon, “Will not die even if cut into
pieces”. That sin is the sap of the tree. Women got it with
the boon, “Amour will last without break”. That sin is
the menstruation of women.
<div n="NI"/>When Tvaṣṭā heard that his righteous son was killed
by Indra unreasonably, he became angry and began to
make burnt offerings with spells and incantations of
Atharvaveda. This offering continued for eight days.
On the eighth day at night, an extremely bright male
person arose from the fire pit. He rose higher and higher
as the flame of fire. Then that figure of power asked
Tvaṣṭā. “Father! what is my name? What have I to
do for you? What is the reason for your grief?” He
said that he was prepared to drink up the ocean dry or
smash the mountains, or prevent the sun and the moon
from moving or any such thing for the sake of his father.
The father ordered him to kill Indra. From that day
onwards Vṛtra got ready to kill Indra. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 6).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The slaughter of Vṛtrāsura.%} Hearing about the pro-
wess, strength, and the martial radiance of Vṛtrāsura,
Indra grew afraid of him and began to think about
means and ways to kill him. Indra called the Saptarṣis
(seven hermits) and sent them to Vṛtra. His intention
was to make a treaty. The seven hermits approached
Vṛtra and requested him to make a treaty with Indra,
and told him that Indra was prepared to give half of
the position of Indra.
<div n="NI"/>Vṛtra:—Look hermits! If Indra honestly desires to be
in peace with me, I have no objection. But what is the
surety that Indra will not deceive me?
<div n="NI"/>Hermits:—If Indra proves to be false and deliberately
deceives you, he has agreed to bear the sin of Brahma-
hatyā incurred, by himself.
<div n="NI"/>Vṛtra agreed to make a treaty on this condition. The
hermits took Vṛtra to the palace of Indra. Seeing Vṛtrā-
sura who was coming to be friends with him Indra rose
from his royal chair and offered half of it to Vṛtra.
Both embraced each other and vowed that they would
be brothers born from the same womb.
<div n="NI"/>Thus having engaged Vṛtra in a treaty deceitfully,
Indra waited for an opportunity to kill Vṛtra. Once
Indra sent Rambhā to infatuate Vṛtra. “Look, beauti-
ful girl! Make Vṛtra senseless somehow so that I may
kill him.” Hearing this, with a beautiful laugh, Rambhā
went with her maids to the Park Nandana and waited
for Vṛtrāsura. At this time Vṛtra, with some Dānava
friends, came to the park Nandana for entertainment.
Indra walked beside watching for the opportunity to
kill him. Without fearing any danger from Indra, Vṛtra
walked through the park, seeing the celestial maids
singing and dancing and playing various games in the
garden, and they reached a corner where Rambhā had
been singing sweet songs and swinging with her maids.
This sight made Vṛtra amorous. He approached
Rambhā and prayed to her to become his wife. Under
that sandalwood tree Rambhā asked him. “Oh hand-
some youth! I am Rambhā. I came here with my
maids to play. Who are you, my Lord?”
[Page884-b+ 64]
Vṛtra: “Beautiful maid! I am the son of Kaśyapa
and the friend of Indra. I enjoy half the position of
Indra. I, Vṛtra, have brought the three worlds under
my control. I shall be complete in all aspects, if I
could marry you.”
<div n="NI"/>Rambhā agreed to the marriage on condition that
Vṛtra would not gainsay her in anything. They engaged
in amorous plays and Rambhā made the Brahmin
drink liquor in large quantities and he became uncons-
cious. Indra took this opportunity and sent his thunder-
bolt which took away the life of Vṛtra. Instantly Indra
became affected with sins such as Brahmahatyā etc.
(Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapters 23 and 24).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Indra washed away the sin of Brahmahatyā incur-
red by killing Vṛtra, at the place called Karūṣa. (See
under Aṅgamalada).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) It was at the time of the killing of Vṛtra by Indra,
that Jaṭāyu and Sampāti made bets and flew up to the
region of the Sun. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
Kāṇḍa, Sarga 58, Stanza 4).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Mention about the conflict between Indra and
Vṛtrāsura occurs in various places in the Ṛgveda.
Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 16, Sūkta 80 refers to
the battle between Indra and Vṛtra. In many other
Sūktas songs about Indra and Vṛtra occur.

swallowed by Vṛtra. But Indra contracted the members
of his body and became smaller and smaller and came
out of Vṛtra's belly. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 9,
Stanza 52).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) Once the teacher-priest Śukra asked Vṛtra certain
questions to all of which Vṛtra gave proper answers.
(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 279, Stanza 13).

Chapter 101, Stanza 15; Udyoga Parva, Chapter 10,
Stanza 30; Śānti Parva, Chapter 232, Stanza 9; Śānti
