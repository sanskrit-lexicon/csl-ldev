VṚTRA¦ (VṚTRĀSURA). A mighty and fierce asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Reason for his birth.%} Vṛtra was the rebirth of emperor
<div n="lb"/>Citraketu. Citraketu and his wife Kṛtadyuti prayed to
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras, as a result of which a son was born to them.
<div n="lb"/>That son died in his infancy. But Aṅgiras brought him
<div n="lb"/>to life again. Brahmā and Nārada taught Citraketu
<div n="lb"/>theosophy. Citraketu sat in contemplation for eight
<div n="lb"/>days and changing himself to a Gandharva he flew
<div n="lb"/>through the sky. As he was flying, he saw Pārvatī sitting
<div n="lb"/>on the thigh of Śiva and laughed aloud. Knowing this
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī cursed him to become an asura. Vṛtrāsura was
<div n="lb"/>the rebirth of the emperor according to this curse.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 6).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Two stories are mentioned about the birth of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtrāsura. One story is that Kaśyapa created him from
<div n="lb"/>fire. The other story is that Vṛtra was the son of Tvaṣṭā.
<div n="lb"/>Both are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Hiraṇyakaśipu was born to Prajāpati Kaśyapa, by
<div n="lb"/>his wife Danu. Mahāviṣṇu killed him on being request-
<div n="lb"/>ed by the Devas. Danu was grieved at the death of her
<div n="lb"/>son. So Kaśyapa gave her another son. He was Vala or
<div n="lb"/>Bala. Indra killed him with his weapon, the thunder-
<div n="lb"/>bolt. Kaśyapa got angry and plucking a hair from his
<div n="lb"/>matted hair, made a burnt offering of it, saying “Let a
<div n="lb"/>son who would be the killer of Indra be born.” Imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately a huge giant, as black as antimony with yellow
<div n="lb"/>eyes was born from the fire. That asura, clad in the
<div n="lb"/>hide of antelope with sword in hand, opening his mouth,
<div n="lb"/>from which two huge tusks protruded, very wide, and
<div n="lb"/>shining with radiance cried out in a voice of thunder,
<div n="lb"/>“Oh! Sage! Order me, what am I to do?”
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa ordered him to kill Indra. He named the
<div n="lb"/>monster Vṛtra. (Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmi Khaṇḍa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 23).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) It was Prajāpati Tvaṣṭā who created Vṛtra to kill
<div n="lb"/>Indra. He had sufficient reasons for it. From the very
<div n="lb"/>beginning Indra and Tvaṣṭā were enemies. Tvaṣṭā be-
<div n="lb"/>got a son named Triśiras otherwise called Viśvarūpa,
<div n="lb"/>for the purpose of killing Indra. This Viśvarūpa had
<div n="lb"/>three heads. One was meant for drinking Surā (a
<div n="lb"/>liquor), the second for drinking Soma (liquor) and the
<div n="lb"/>third for eating food. Viśvarūpa was a Brāhmaṇa. Still,
<div n="lb"/>as his mother was an asura, he loved the asuras and
<div n="lb"/>mingled with them. Indra knew about the behaviour
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvarūpa. He concluded that it was blasphemy and
<div n="lb"/>wickedness. Indra who was afraid of Viśvarūpa, got
<div n="lb"/>angry and cut off his heads. Of the heads of Viśvarūpa,
<div n="lb"/>that which drank Soma became a bird called Kapiñ-
<div n="lb"/>jala, that which drank Surā became a bird called
<div n="lb"/>Kalapiṅga, and that which ate food became the
<div n="lb"/>bird Tittiri (partridge). Brahmahatyā (the sin of kill-
<div n="lb"/>ing Brahmin) took shape and went against Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Though Indra could have destroyed it, he joined his
[Page884-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>hands and received it. At the end of the year he cut it
<div n="lb"/>into four pieces and divided them among earth, water,
<div n="lb"/>tree and woman. The earth received it with the boon
<div n="lb"/>that depressions will be filled. That sin is now seen as
<div n="lb"/>salt beds. Water got it with the boon, “Will be swollen
<div n="lb"/>when joined”. That sin is foam and bubbles. The tree
<div n="lb"/>got it with the boon, “Will not die even if cut into
<div n="lb"/>pieces”. That sin is the sap of the tree. Women got it with
<div n="lb"/>the boon, “Amour will last without break”. That sin is
<div n="lb"/>the menstruation of women.
<div n="NI"/>When Tvaṣṭā heard that his righteous son was killed
<div n="lb"/>by Indra unreasonably, he became angry and began to
<div n="lb"/>make burnt offerings with spells and incantations of
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda. This offering continued for eight days.
<div n="lb"/>On the eighth day at night, an extremely bright male
<div n="lb"/>person arose from the fire pit. He rose higher and higher
<div n="lb"/>as the flame of fire. Then that figure of power asked
<div n="lb"/>Tvaṣṭā. “Father! what is my name? What have I to
<div n="lb"/>do for you? What is the reason for your grief?” He
<div n="lb"/>said that he was prepared to drink up the ocean dry or
<div n="lb"/>smash the mountains, or prevent the sun and the moon
<div n="lb"/>from moving or any such thing for the sake of his father.
<div n="lb"/>The father ordered him to kill Indra. From that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards Vṛtra got ready to kill Indra. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 6).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The slaughter of Vṛtrāsura.%} Hearing about the pro-
<div n="lb"/>wess, strength, and the martial radiance of Vṛtrāsura,
<div n="lb"/>Indra grew afraid of him and began to think about
<div n="lb"/>means and ways to kill him. Indra called the Saptarṣis
<div n="lb"/>(seven hermits) and sent them to Vṛtra. His intention
<div n="lb"/>was to make a treaty. The seven hermits approached
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra and requested him to make a treaty with Indra,
<div n="lb"/>and told him that Indra was prepared to give half of
<div n="lb"/>the position of Indra.
<div n="NI"/>Vṛtra:—Look hermits! If Indra honestly desires to be
<div n="lb"/>in peace with me, I have no objection. But what is the
<div n="lb"/>surety that Indra will not deceive me?
<div n="NI"/>Hermits:—If Indra proves to be false and deliberately
<div n="lb"/>deceives you, he has agreed to bear the sin of Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>hatyā incurred, by himself.
<div n="NI"/>Vṛtra agreed to make a treaty on this condition. The
<div n="lb"/>hermits took Vṛtra to the palace of Indra. Seeing Vṛtrā-
<div n="lb"/>sura who was coming to be friends with him Indra rose
<div n="lb"/>from his royal chair and offered half of it to Vṛtra.
<div n="lb"/>Both embraced each other and vowed that they would
<div n="lb"/>be brothers born from the same womb.
<div n="NI"/>Thus having engaged Vṛtra in a treaty deceitfully,
<div n="lb"/>Indra waited for an opportunity to kill Vṛtra. Once
<div n="lb"/>Indra sent Rambhā to infatuate Vṛtra. “Look, beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful girl! Make Vṛtra senseless somehow so that I may
<div n="lb"/>kill him.” Hearing this, with a beautiful laugh, Rambhā
<div n="lb"/>went with her maids to the Park Nandana and waited
<div n="lb"/>for Vṛtrāsura. At this time Vṛtra, with some Dānava
<div n="lb"/>friends, came to the park Nandana for entertainment.
<div n="lb"/>Indra walked beside watching for the opportunity to
<div n="lb"/>kill him. Without fearing any danger from Indra, Vṛtra
<div n="lb"/>walked through the park, seeing the celestial maids
<div n="lb"/>singing and dancing and playing various games in the
<div n="lb"/>garden, and they reached a corner where Rambhā had
<div n="lb"/>been singing sweet songs and swinging with her maids.
<div n="lb"/>This sight made Vṛtra amorous. He approached
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā and prayed to her to become his wife. Under
<div n="lb"/>that sandalwood tree Rambhā asked him. “Oh hand-
<div n="lb"/>some youth! I am Rambhā. I came here with my
<div n="lb"/>maids to play. Who are you, my Lord?”
[Page884-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra: “Beautiful maid! I am the son of Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>and the friend of Indra. I enjoy half the position of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. I, Vṛtra, have brought the three worlds under
<div n="lb"/>my control. I shall be complete in all aspects, if I
<div n="lb"/>could marry you.”
<div n="NI"/>Rambhā agreed to the marriage on condition that
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra would not gainsay her in anything. They engaged
<div n="lb"/>in amorous plays and Rambhā made the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>drink liquor in large quantities and he became uncons-
<div n="lb"/>cious. Indra took this opportunity and sent his thunder-
<div n="lb"/>bolt which took away the life of Vṛtra. Instantly Indra
<div n="lb"/>became affected with sins such as Brahmahatyā etc.
<div n="lb"/>(Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapters 23 and 24).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Indra washed away the sin of Brahmahatyā incur-
<div n="lb"/>red by killing Vṛtra, at the place called Karūṣa. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Aṅgamalada).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) It was at the time of the killing of Vṛtra by Indra,
<div n="lb"/>that Jaṭāyu and Sampāti made bets and flew up to the
<div n="lb"/>region of the Sun. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Sarga 58, Stanza 4).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Mention about the conflict between Indra and
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtrāsura occurs in various places in the Ṛgveda.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 16, Sūkta 80 refers to
<div n="lb"/>the battle between Indra and Vṛtra. In many other
<div n="lb"/>Sūktas songs about Indra and Vṛtra occur.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 65, Stanza 33, that Vṛtra was the son born to
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Danu.
<div n="NI"/>(v) It was Vṛtrāsura who took rebirth later as King
<div n="lb"/>Maṇimān. (M.B. Ādi Parva. Chapter 67, Stanza 44).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) The thunderbolt of Indra hit on the head of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtrāsura and was broken into ten big pieces and
<div n="lb"/>hundred small pieces. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 169,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 50).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 9, Stanza 48, that Vṛtrāsura was born from
<div n="lb"/>the fire of Sorcery and witchcraft of Tvaṣṭā.
<div n="NI"/>(viii) In the fight between Indra and Vṛtra, Indra was
<div n="lb"/>swallowed by Vṛtra. But Indra contracted the members
<div n="lb"/>of his body and became smaller and smaller and came
<div n="lb"/>out of Vṛtra's belly. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 9,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 52).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) Once the teacher-priest Śukra asked Vṛtra certain
<div n="lb"/>questions to all of which Vṛtra gave proper answers.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 279, Stanza 13).
<div n="NI"/>(x) Vṛtra entered heaven after his death. (Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 180, Stanza 57).
<div n="NI"/>(xi) Everybody was terrified because the fight of
<div n="lb"/>Indra with Vṛtra prolonged without any termination.
<div n="lb"/>At last Vṛtra gaped and taking this opportunity, Indra
<div n="lb"/>sent his weapon the thunderbolt into the mouth of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra. Thus Vṛtra met with death. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 101, Stanza 15; Udyoga Parva, Chapter 10,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 30; Śānti Parva, Chapter 232, Stanza 9; Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 283, Stanza 59).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) In Mahābhārata, the words, Asura, Asuraśreṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>Asurendra, Daitya, Daityapati, Daityendra, Dānava,
<div n="lb"/>Dānavendra, Ditija, Surāri, Tvāṣṭar, Viśvātmā etc. are
<div n="lb"/>used as synonyms of Vṛtra.
