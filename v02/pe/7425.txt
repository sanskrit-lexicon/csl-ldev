ŚVETA V¦. Son of the elder brother of King Sudeva.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story of how Śveta, who was a sinner,
<div n="lb"/>attained mokṣa (salvation) by a vision of sage Agastya.
<div n="lb"/>Towards the end of his life, Śveta attained Mokṣa by
<div n="lb"/>performing austere tapas. But since he failed to earn
<div n="lb"/>God's grace by giving food to the hungry, even in
<div n="lb"/>Heaven, he was tormented by hunger and thirst. His
<div n="lb"/>hunger was so severe that he began eating his own flesh.
<div n="lb"/>At last as suggested by Brahmā he was born again on
<div n="lb"/>earth and after a visit to Agastya re-entered Heaven.
