LOHA I¦. An Asura. When the Pāṇḍavas were living inco-
gnito they kept their weapons in a secret place. Availing
of this opportunity Loha made an attack on the Pāṇḍa-
vas. At once the devas made him blind and thus
helped the Pāṇḍavas. That place later became famous
as Lohaṇapura. (Skanda Purāṇa 1, 2, 65)
