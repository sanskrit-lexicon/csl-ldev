LOHA I¦. An Asura. When the Pāṇḍavas were living inco-
<div n="lb"/>gnito they kept their weapons in a secret place. Availing
<div n="lb"/>of this opportunity Loha made an attack on the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas. At once the devas made him blind and thus
<div n="lb"/>helped the Pāṇḍavas. That place later became famous
<div n="lb"/>as Lohaṇapura. (Skanda Purāṇa 1, 2, 65)
