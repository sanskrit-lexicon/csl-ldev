SŪKṢMAPRAKṚTI¦. The cause which is indestructible,
not clear and having always goodness as its form is
Sūkṣmaprakṛti. That unspeakable nature has no base.
Sūkṣmaprakṛti is immovable and indestructible. There
is no sound or form or touch in it. This nature which
has no beginning or end, which has only three attributes
is the root cause of the universe. This entire universe
was pervaded by this power from the beginning of the
great deluge to the beginning of creation. Then there
was no night or day, no earth or Sky, no light or
darkness. Then there was only Brahman the union of
Prakṛti and Puruṣa which could not be perceived by
sense organs or intelligence. (See under Prakṛti).
