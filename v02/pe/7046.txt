SŪKṢMAPRAKṚTI¦. The cause which is indestructible,
<div n="lb"/>not clear and having always goodness as its form is
<div n="lb"/>Sūkṣmaprakṛti. That unspeakable nature has no base.
<div n="lb"/>Sūkṣmaprakṛti is immovable and indestructible. There
<div n="lb"/>is no sound or form or touch in it. This nature which
<div n="lb"/>has no beginning or end, which has only three attributes
<div n="lb"/>is the root cause of the universe. This entire universe
<div n="lb"/>was pervaded by this power from the beginning of the
<div n="lb"/>great deluge to the beginning of creation. Then there
<div n="lb"/>was no night or day, no earth or Sky, no light or
<div n="lb"/>darkness. Then there was only Brahman the union of
<div n="lb"/>Prakṛti and Puruṣa which could not be perceived by
<div n="lb"/>sense organs or intelligence. (See under Prakṛti).
