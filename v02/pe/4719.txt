NANDABHADRA¦. A righteous Vaiśya. Having been
childless for a long time this Vaiśya, who was an ardent
devotee of God Kapileśvara, got a son in his old age.
But he died after his marriage. With this calamity
Nandabhadra became a man of abstinence and began
to try to acquire spiritual knowledge. After a while a
seven-year-old boy appeared before the Vaiśya and
quenched his thirst for spiritual knowledge. Later with
meditation on Śiva and the Sun, Nandabhadra attained
heaven. (Skanda Purāṇa, Chapters 1, 2 and 46).
