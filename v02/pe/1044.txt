BHĀNUMATĪ I¦. The daughter of Bhānu, a leader of
<div n="lb"/>the Yādavas. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa went with his retinue of
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas to visit the holy palace called Piṇḍāraka the
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas conducted a wine festival. During that festi-
<div n="lb"/>val a demon of the name Nikumbha carried away
<div n="lb"/>Bhānumatī. This was because of a curse to Bhānumatī
<div n="lb"/>from Durvāsas whom Bhānumatī did not respect once
<div n="lb"/>when they met at the garden of Raivata. Durvāsas had
<div n="lb"/>after the curse consoled her by assuring her that she
<div n="lb"/>would be saved and married by Sahadeva, one of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. True to this, Bhānumatī was married to Saha-
<div n="lb"/>deva in the presence of Nārada and Kṛṣṇa. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 90).
