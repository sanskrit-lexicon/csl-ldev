KAHOḌA¦ (KAHOḌAKA—KHAGODAKA). A sage
the disciple and son-in-law of Uddālaka. He was
the father of the sage Aṣṭāvakra.
<div n="NI"/>Uddālaka had another name “Śvetaketu”. He was a
sage who had personally seen and talked to the goddess
Sarasvatī. It was at that time that Kahoḍaka became
his disciple. Kahoḍaka who was of a gentle nature
served his preceptor for a long time and won his favour.
He was immensely pleased and after teaching the
necessary things gave his daughter Sujātā in marriage
to Kahoḍaka. In due course, Sujātā became pregnant.
One day, the child in the womb cried out that there
was a mistake in his father's recitation of the Vedas.
Kahoḍaka was displeased at this. He cursed the child
that he would be born with a body having eight bends
(curves). So the boy was named “Aṣṭāvakra” (one
who has eight bends). Sujātā who was poor, once sent
Kahoḍaka to King Janaka for some money. Kahoḍaka
who was defeated in a disputation was immersed in
water. Aṣṭāvakra rescued his father. (See under Aṣṭā-
vakra).
