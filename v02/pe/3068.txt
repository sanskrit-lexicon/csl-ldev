KĀKA¦ (CROW).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Kaśyapa was the son of Marīci, who was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Brahmā. Kaśyapa's wife Tāmrā had many
<div n="lb"/>daughters like Kākī, Śyenī, Bhāsī, Gṛdhṛkā, Śukī and
<div n="lb"/>Grīvā. From Kākī were born the crows in the world.
<div n="lb"/>(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 19).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Crows—the symbol of sin.%} There is a reference in
<div n="lb"/>Śiva Purāṇa to this. Long ago the King of Kāśī had a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Kalāvatī. Even in her youth, she
<div n="lb"/>received the “Śaiva pañcākṣara mantra.” After that,
<div n="lb"/>she was married by Dāśārha, King of Mathurā, who
<div n="lb"/>was a sinner. When he touched Kalāvatī who was a
<div n="lb"/>holy woman, he experienced unbearable heat. Kalāvatī
<div n="lb"/>said that it was because of the King's sin. So she took
<div n="lb"/>Dāśārha to the sage Garga, who purified Dāśārha with
<div n="lb"/>his mantras (incantations) and made him stand in
<div n="lb"/>water. At once the King's sins came out of his body
<div n="lb"/>in the shape of crows. Some of them flew away. Many
<div n="lb"/>of them fell down with their wings burnt. Seeing this,
<div n="lb"/>the sage Garga said that all those crows were the
<div n="lb"/>volume of sins accumulated in the course of the innu-
<div n="lb"/>merable births through which he had passed. (Śiva
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Pañcākṣara Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Crow and Rice-offerings.%} In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>there is a story about the crow's right to eat the
<div n="lb"/>offering of rice to Pitṛs. Once a King named Marutta
<div n="lb"/>performed a Maheśvara sattra. Indra and other gods
<div n="lb"/>attended the sattra. Hearing about this, Rāvaṇa came
<div n="lb"/>that way. The frightened gods fled away assuming the
<div n="lb"/>forms of different birds. Yama escaped in the form of
<div n="lb"/>a crow. From that time, Yama was pleased with crows.
<div n="lb"/>He gave a blessing that in future, when human beings
<div n="lb"/>worship the piṭrs by offering rice to them, the crows
<div n="lb"/>will have the right to eat that rice. Thus the right of
<div n="lb"/>the crows to eat offerings of rice, originated from that
<div n="lb"/>time. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
