DEVA¦(S). Gods or deities.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} From time immemorial belief in
Devas has existed in every country and all religions have
lauded their superior nature and power. It was the
Hindus and the Buddhists who first applied the term ‘Deva’
to certain very subtle beings recognised in all religions.
The Pārsi religion (Zaratuṣṭra) has spoken about seven
Devarājans and their attendants. ‘Ameṣ pentas’ is the
actual term used for the Devarāja. The Christian reli-
gion refers to nine sects of Devas like Srāfi, Kherubi,
Dominion, Angel etc. Īslam refers to four chief Devas
viz. Gabriel, the presiding Deva over revelations, Mik-
hayel of protection, Asriyal of death and Israfin of resur-
ruction. An important section of the Ṛgveda is Sūktas
about Devās like Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni etc. In
Yajñas etc. Devas occupy a very important place. The
Kenopaniṣad states that the conceited and haughty Devas
were taught a lesson by God. The subject matter of the
Kaṭhopaniṣad is the advice given by Yama to Naciketas.
The Muṇḍakopaniṣad says that the Devas, man and
birds originated from God.
<F>1. Tasmācca devāḥ bahudhā samprasūtāḥ sādhyāḥ manuṣyāḥ paśavo vayāṃsaḥ.</F> There are references about
Deva worship in the Smṛtis. The Purāṇas and Upapu-
[Page207-b+ 62]
rāṇas contain scientific discussions, about the origin,
work or functions, classes, etc. of Devas. The Mantra-
śāstra and Tantraśāstra deal also about the various sects
and class of Devas, their nature, and the worship to be
offered to them etc.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Christian Devas, Satan and devils.%} Christian religious
books commonly use the term Mālākhas for Devas.
Greek mythology contains a story about the Mālākhas,
who did not obey the orders of Jehovah and how He
cursed them, turned them into devils and flung them into
hell. And, in hell they organised a revolutionary party
to fight Jehovah. Many leaders talked on the subject of
how to take vengeance on Jehovah. It was nearabout
this period that Jehovah created with the dust on earth
Adam as his beloved son and settled him in the garden of
Aden. God created from the ribs of Adam the woman
called Eve, and they lived in Eden quite happily.
<div n="NI"/>Satan and other leaders in hell decided that the greatest
revenge that could be taken upon Jehovah was to create
troubles for his dear son, Adam in Eden. Accordingly
Satan went to Eden and made Adam and Eve eat the
forbidden fruit with the result that Jehovah cursed and
turned them into human beings and turned them out of
Eden. Milton in his reputed poem Paradise Lost has told
the above story in inimitable language.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indian Devas.%} Most of the Indian Devas are the sons
of Kaśyapa Prajāpati by Aditi, daughter of Dakṣa Prajā-
pati. The total number of Devas is 33 crores. The Devas
are divided into many classes or sections like Ādityas,
Viśvadevatas, Vasus, Tuṣitas, Ābhāsvaras, Anilas, Mahā-
rājikas, Sādhyas, Rudras, Vidyādharas, Pitṛdevas etc.
There are further divisions like Apsaras, Virūpākṣas,
Bhadras, Gandharvas, Kuṃbhāṇḍas, Rākṣasas, Nāgas,
Aśvinīs, Kinnaras, Kiṃpuruṣas, Piśācas, Guhyakas,
Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Matṛs, Kūśmāṇḍas, Bhūtas, Vetālas,
etc. Yet another division is into Lokapālas, Lipikas etc.
The Devas are classified with special reference to
bhūtagaṇas like Pṛthvī etc. and are, therefore, referred
to as Bhūdevatās, Agnidevatās, Vāyudevatās, etc. The
presiding spirit of Bhūdevatās is Kubera, that of the
Jaladevatās is Varuṇa, that of the Agnidevatās, Vāyu-
bhagavān and that of the Ākāśadevatas, Indra. And,
under them there are various sets of Devas in charge of
different departments. Sādhyas, Vasus, Ādityas, Apsaras
etc. are Ākāśadevas, Maruttas and Gandharvas,
Vāyudevas. Yakṣas and Yakṣīs are servants of
Kubera. Virūpākṣa, Bhadra etc. are Bhūdevas.
Virūpākṣa supports the earth according to the Vālmīki
Purāṇa. Those who protect nidhis (treasures) may also
be considered Bhūmidevas.
<div n="NI"/>There are 33 bosses or presiding spirits for the 33 crores
of Devas. Dvādaśādityas (12) Ekādaśarudras (11)
Aṣṭavasus (8) and Aśvinīdevas (2) are the 33 chiefs of
Devas. Indra is the chief of all of them.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The term Deva.%} The word Deva means light and
also play. Devas shine forth, they are also playful.
Thus the name is quite apt for them. (See Grāma-
devatā).
