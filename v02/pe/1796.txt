DEVA¦(S). Gods or deities.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} From time immemorial belief in
<div n="lb"/>Devas has existed in every country and all religions have
<div n="lb"/>lauded their superior nature and power. It was the
<div n="lb"/>Hindus and the Buddhists who first applied the term ‘Deva’
<div n="lb"/>to certain very subtle beings recognised in all religions.
<div n="lb"/>The Pārsi religion (Zaratuṣṭra) has spoken about seven
<div n="lb"/>Devarājans and their attendants. ‘Ameṣ pentas’ is the
<div n="lb"/>actual term used for the Devarāja. The Christian reli-
<div n="lb"/>gion refers to nine sects of Devas like Srāfi, Kherubi,
<div n="lb"/>Dominion, Angel etc. Īslam refers to four chief Devas
<div n="lb"/>viz. Gabriel, the presiding Deva over revelations, Mik-
<div n="lb"/>hayel of protection, Asriyal of death and Israfin of resur-
<div n="lb"/>ruction. An important section of the Ṛgveda is Sūktas
<div n="lb"/>about Devās like Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni etc. In
<div n="lb"/>Yajñas etc. Devas occupy a very important place. The
<div n="lb"/>Kenopaniṣad states that the conceited and haughty Devas
<div n="lb"/>were taught a lesson by God. The subject matter of the
<div n="lb"/>Kaṭhopaniṣad is the advice given by Yama to Naciketas.
<div n="lb"/>The Muṇḍakopaniṣad says that the Devas, man and
<div n="lb"/>birds originated from God.
<F>1. Tasmācca devāḥ bahudhā samprasūtāḥ sādhyāḥ manuṣyāḥ paśavo vayāṃsaḥ.</F> There are references about
<div n="lb"/>Deva worship in the Smṛtis. The Purāṇas and Upapu-
[Page207-b+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>rāṇas contain scientific discussions, about the origin,
<div n="lb"/>work or functions, classes, etc. of Devas. The Mantra-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra and Tantraśāstra deal also about the various sects
<div n="lb"/>and class of Devas, their nature, and the worship to be
<div n="lb"/>offered to them etc.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Christian Devas, Satan and devils.%} Christian religious
<div n="lb"/>books commonly use the term Mālākhas for Devas.
<div n="lb"/>Greek mythology contains a story about the Mālākhas,
<div n="lb"/>who did not obey the orders of Jehovah and how He
<div n="lb"/>cursed them, turned them into devils and flung them into
<div n="lb"/>hell. And, in hell they organised a revolutionary party
<div n="lb"/>to fight Jehovah. Many leaders talked on the subject of
<div n="lb"/>how to take vengeance on Jehovah. It was nearabout
<div n="lb"/>this period that Jehovah created with the dust on earth
<div n="lb"/>Adam as his beloved son and settled him in the garden of
<div n="lb"/>Aden. God created from the ribs of Adam the woman
<div n="lb"/>called Eve, and they lived in Eden quite happily.
<div n="NI"/>Satan and other leaders in hell decided that the greatest
<div n="lb"/>revenge that could be taken upon Jehovah was to create
<div n="lb"/>troubles for his dear son, Adam in Eden. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Satan went to Eden and made Adam and Eve eat the
<div n="lb"/>forbidden fruit with the result that Jehovah cursed and
<div n="lb"/>turned them into human beings and turned them out of
<div n="lb"/>Eden. Milton in his reputed poem Paradise Lost has told
<div n="lb"/>the above story in inimitable language.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indian Devas.%} Most of the Indian Devas are the sons
<div n="lb"/>of Kaśyapa Prajāpati by Aditi, daughter of Dakṣa Prajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati. The total number of Devas is 33 crores. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>are divided into many classes or sections like Ādityas,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvadevatas, Vasus, Tuṣitas, Ābhāsvaras, Anilas, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>rājikas, Sādhyas, Rudras, Vidyādharas, Pitṛdevas etc.
<div n="lb"/>There are further divisions like Apsaras, Virūpākṣas,
<div n="lb"/>Bhadras, Gandharvas, Kuṃbhāṇḍas, Rākṣasas, Nāgas,
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīs, Kinnaras, Kiṃpuruṣas, Piśācas, Guhyakas,
<div n="lb"/>Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Matṛs, Kūśmāṇḍas, Bhūtas, Vetālas,
<div n="lb"/>etc. Yet another division is into Lokapālas, Lipikas etc.
<div n="lb"/>The Devas are classified with special reference to
<div n="lb"/>bhūtagaṇas like Pṛthvī etc. and are, therefore, referred
<div n="lb"/>to as Bhūdevatās, Agnidevatās, Vāyudevatās, etc. The
<div n="lb"/>presiding spirit of Bhūdevatās is Kubera, that of the
<div n="lb"/>Jaladevatās is Varuṇa, that of the Agnidevatās, Vāyu-
<div n="lb"/>bhagavān and that of the Ākāśadevatas, Indra. And,
<div n="lb"/>under them there are various sets of Devas in charge of
<div n="lb"/>different departments. Sādhyas, Vasus, Ādityas, Apsaras
<div n="lb"/>etc. are Ākāśadevas, Maruttas and Gandharvas,
<div n="lb"/>Vāyudevas. Yakṣas and Yakṣīs are servants of
<div n="lb"/>Kubera. Virūpākṣa, Bhadra etc. are Bhūdevas.
<div n="lb"/>Virūpākṣa supports the earth according to the Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa. Those who protect nidhis (treasures) may also
<div n="lb"/>be considered Bhūmidevas.
<div n="NI"/>There are 33 bosses or presiding spirits for the 33 crores
<div n="lb"/>of Devas. Dvādaśādityas (12) Ekādaśarudras (11)
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭavasus (8) and Aśvinīdevas (2) are the 33 chiefs of
<div n="lb"/>Devas. Indra is the chief of all of them.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The term Deva.%} The word Deva means light and
<div n="lb"/>also play. Devas shine forth, they are also playful.
<div n="lb"/>Thus the name is quite apt for them. (See Grāma-
<div n="lb"/>devatā).
