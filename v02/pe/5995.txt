SĀLAGRĀMA¦. A stone emblem of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin of the name.%} Sālagrāma is the kind of
<div n="lb"/>ammonite, used for making the image of Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu is known by the name Sālagrāma also.
<div n="lb"/>This name originated from the name Sālagrāma,
<div n="lb"/>which is the name of the place from where the river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍakī, which flows through Nepal, starts. This
<div n="lb"/>Sālagrāma is considered to be a holy place. Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and other gods always dwell in this place. Sālagrāma
<div n="lb"/>is the name of Viṣṇu who dwells in Sālagrāma. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Stanzas 123 to 125).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The importance of Sālagrāma.%} The place Sālagrāma
<div n="lb"/>is at the origin of river Gaṇḍakī. There are various
<div n="lb"/>kinds of stone figures which are called Sālagrāmas.
<div n="lb"/>These Sālagrāmas themselves have originated from
<div n="lb"/>portions of Viṣṇu. That is why those stones are used
<div n="lb"/>for making images of Viṣṇu. There is a story in the
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, stating that the derivation
<div n="lb"/>of these stones is from a portion of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>During the early days, Sarasvatī, Lakṣmī and Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>were wives of Mahāviṣṇu. One day there arose a family
<div n="lb"/>quarrel among them. (See under Tulasī). As a result
<div n="lb"/>of this quarrel, the Devīs cursed each other. Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>cursed Lakṣmī and changed her to holy basil plant
<div n="lb"/>(Tulasī) on the earth. When Lakṣmī was about to
<div n="lb"/>depart as Tulasī, Mahāviṣṇu blessed her thus. “Look!
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī! you will live in the world as a holy basil and
<div n="lb"/>when the curse has been completed you will come back
<div n="lb"/>to me. On that day, a river named Gaṇḍakī, will start
<div n="lb"/>from your body which will be in the shape of the holy
<div n="lb"/>basil plant. (It is also said that the river Gaṇḍakī
<div n="lb"/>has taken birth from the sweat of Śiva and Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Refer to the word Gaṇḍakī). On the bank of that
<div n="lb"/>river, I will remain as a stone image. There will be so
<div n="lb"/>many worms with strong tusks and teeth, which will pierce
<div n="lb"/>the stone into the shape of Sudarśana cakra (the weapon
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu) and will create numberless Sālagrāmas. The
<div n="lb"/>Sālagrāmas thus made, will be of various sizes and
<div n="lb"/>shapes.”
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Different classes of Sālagrāmas.%} Mention is made in
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas about nineteen classes of Sālagrāmas. They
<div n="lb"/>are given below:
[Page673-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Lakṣmīnārāyaṇa.%} With one hole, four cakras
<div n="lb"/>(wheels) and Vanamālā (a line like the garland) and
<div n="lb"/>of the colour of clouds.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Lakṣmījanārdana.%} This is the same as Lakṣmīnārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, with the difference that there will be no
<div n="lb"/>Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Raghunātha.%} With two holes and four wheels and
<div n="lb"/>mark of the hoof of a calf. This also will have no
<div n="lb"/>Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Vāmana.%} With two very small wheels and
<div n="lb"/>the colour of the cloud. This too will have no
<div n="lb"/>Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Śrīdhara.%} This is the same as Vāmana with the
<div n="lb"/>exception that it will be having Vanamālā. The house
<div n="lb"/>in which this is placed will have a prosperity and well
<div n="lb"/>being of its own.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Dāmodara.%} Will be large and round with two
<div n="lb"/>cakras (wheels) and with no Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Raṇarāma.%} Neither too large nor too small, but of
<div n="lb"/>medium size and round, with two wheels and the
<div n="lb"/>marks of child's kick, bow and quiver.
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Rājarājeśvara.%} Of the size of Raṇarāma with
<div n="lb"/>seven cakras, (wheels), ornamented with the mark of
<div n="lb"/>umbrella. This will earn for the possessor kingly
<div n="lb"/>wealth.
<div n="NI"/>(ix) {%Ananta.%} Somewhat thick with fourteen wheels,
<div n="lb"/>and as black as a cloud. This Sālagrāma will give men
<div n="lb"/>the four Puruṣārthas (objects of life) ‘Dharmārtha-
<div n="lb"/>kārnamokṣa’ (Duty, wealth, desire and salvation).
<div n="NI"/>(x) {%Madhusūdana.%} A sālagrāma in the shape of a wheel
<div n="lb"/>with two wheels, and impression of cow's hoof,
<div n="lb"/>having the shade of cloud, of ordinary size. This will
<div n="lb"/>be very bright.
<div n="NI"/>(xi) {%Sudarśana.%} Sudarśana will have only one cakra
<div n="lb"/>(wheel).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) {%Gadādhara.%} This also will be having only one
<div n="lb"/>wheel which will not be bright.
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) {%Hayagrīva.%} This will have two wheels and the face
<div n="lb"/>of a horse.
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) {%Nārasiṃha.%} With a very wide mouth, two wheels,
<div n="lb"/>and awful shape. This Sālagrāma will cause instant
<div n="lb"/>self-renunciation.
<div n="NI"/>(xv) {%Lakṣmīnarasiṃha.%} This also will be having a wide
<div n="lb"/>mouth and two wheels. Besides these, there will be the
<div n="lb"/>Vanamālā also. This will make house-holders cosy
<div n="lb"/>and comfortable.
<div n="NI"/>(xvi) {%Vāsudeva.%} The Sālagrāma with two wheels at
<div n="lb"/>the region of the hole and with round shape having
<div n="lb"/>vividness and brightness, is Vāsudeva. This will grant
<div n="lb"/>all desires.
<div n="NI"/>(xvii) {%Pradyumna.%} This will have only a minute wheel.
<div n="lb"/>The colour will be that of clouds. But on the outer
<div n="lb"/>side, there will be a hole in the inside of which there
<div n="lb"/>will be a number of cuts or dents. This will give house-
<div n="lb"/>holders comfort always.
<div n="NI"/>(xviii) {%Saṅkarṣaṇa.%} In the Saṅkarṣaṇa two wheels
<div n="lb"/>will be joined face to face. The fore-part will be thin-
<div n="lb"/>ner than the hind-part. This also will do good to
<div n="lb"/>house-holders.
<div n="NI"/>(xix) {%Aniruddha.%} The colour of this is yellow. This
<div n="lb"/>will be quite round and bright. This also will give
<div n="lb"/>comfort to the house-holder. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 9; Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 46).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%The greatness of Sālagrāma.%} Of these, the stones
<div n="lb"/>with cakras (the weapon Discus), are Bhagavān Viṣṇu
[Page673-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>in reality. Those who worship this stone with mark of
<div n="lb"/>cakra, need not have to take another birth. He who
<div n="lb"/>habitually worships Sālagrāma, should avoid arro-
<div n="lb"/>gance and should be charitable. He who worships
<div n="lb"/>Sālagrāma with the mark of wheel should not covet
<div n="lb"/>others' wealth and women. The cakra from Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>and the stone from Gaṇḍakī will bring atonement in
<div n="lb"/>a moment for sins incurred in a hundred births. Even
<div n="lb"/>if one has incurred thousands of sins, one will get remis-
<div n="lb"/>sion for all of them by drinking the water of Sālagrāma.
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra will attain
<div n="lb"/>heaven if they become house-holders according to
<div n="lb"/>Vedic convention and worship Sālagrāma. On no
<div n="lb"/>account should women worship Sālagrāma. If by
<div n="lb"/>ignorance, a woman, whether she is good-natured or of
<div n="lb"/>a higher status, happens to touch Sālagrāma, all her
<div n="lb"/>merits earned by good deeds will be lost and she will
<div n="lb"/>go to hell. Brahmin sages say that women throwing
<div n="lb"/>flowers as oblation on Sālagrāma, commit the greatest
<div n="lb"/>sin. If a woman touches a Sālagrāma, the offering of
<div n="lb"/>Sandal-wood will be like poisoned rice, flowers like
<div n="lb"/>diamond, and meals presented to god before being
<div n="lb"/>eaten by the servants in the temple, will be like Kāla-
<div n="lb"/>kūṭa (the poison of Vāsuki), to Bhagavān Viṣṇu. If
<div n="lb"/>a woman touches Sālagrāma, she will have to remain
<div n="lb"/>in hell for the duration of fourteen Indras. Even the
<div n="lb"/>sin of Brahmahatyā (killing a brahmin) will be remit-
<div n="lb"/>ted by drinking the water of Sālagrāma and he will
<div n="lb"/>attain heaven. Basil (tulasī) sandalwood, water, conch
<div n="lb"/>tinkling bell, wheel, stone, copper pot, and name of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu comprise ‘Padāmṛta’ (the celestial nectar of
<div n="lb"/>words) which is said to have the power of remit-
<div n="lb"/>ting sins. The merits obtained by bathing in all
<div n="lb"/>the tīrthas and the performing of all the yāgas (sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fices) dwell in each drop of water of Sālagrāma.
<div n="lb"/>(Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 20).
