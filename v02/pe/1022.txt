BHĀMAHA¦. A critic who lived in the sixth century A.D.
<div n="lb"/>He was one of the top critics in the Sanskrit language.
<div n="lb"/>His important work is ‘Kāvyālaṃkāra’. This is also
<div n="lb"/>called Bhāmahālaṃkāra by a few. There are six chapters
<div n="lb"/>in this. The first chapter deals with Kāvyaśarīra, the
<div n="lb"/>second and third with Alaṃkāra, the fourth with Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>doṣa the fifth with Nyāya and the sixth with Śabdaśud-
<div n="lb"/>dhi. As against Daṇḍī Bhāmaha separates ‘Kathā’ from
<div n="lb"/>‘Ākhyāyikā’. According to him the requisites of a good
<div n="lb"/>Kāvya are sweetness, pleasantness and liveliness. Daṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>prescribes ten attributes for a good Kāvya. Bhāmaha is
<div n="lb"/>of opinion that Vakrokti is no alaṃkāra at all. In
<div n="lb"/>a wider sense it is ‘atiśayokti’ (exaggeration). But
<div n="lb"/>Bhāmaha admits it has a place in Kāvya.
