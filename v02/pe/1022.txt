BHĀMAHA¦. A critic who lived in the sixth century A.D.
He was one of the top critics in the Sanskrit language.
His important work is ‘Kāvyālaṃkāra’. This is also
called Bhāmahālaṃkāra by a few. There are six chapters
in this. The first chapter deals with Kāvyaśarīra, the
second and third with Alaṃkāra, the fourth with Kāvya-
doṣa the fifth with Nyāya and the sixth with Śabdaśud-
dhi. As against Daṇḍī Bhāmaha separates ‘Kathā’ from
‘Ākhyāyikā’. According to him the requisites of a good
Kāvya are sweetness, pleasantness and liveliness. Daṇḍī
prescribes ten attributes for a good Kāvya. Bhāmaha is
of opinion that Vakrokti is no alaṃkāra at all. In
a wider sense it is ‘atiśayokti’ (exaggeration). But
Bhāmaha admits it has a place in Kāvya.
