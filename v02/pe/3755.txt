KUBJĀ¦. An ugly woman about whom the following
story is told in Chapter 126, of Uttarakhaṇḍa in Padma
Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Kubjā became a widow in her very childhood, and she
spent eight years in observing auspicious ceremonies.
As she took the ‘Māgha bath’ every year she attained
salvation. This was the period when Sunda and
Upasunda were harassing the world, and to destroy
them Kubjā incarnated as Tilottamā and hooked them
by her excellent beauty. They fought each other for her

hand and got killed. Brahmā was pleased at this and
granted Kubjā a place in Sūryaloka.
