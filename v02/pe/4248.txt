MALAYAPRABHA¦. A King celebrated in Purāṇas. He
ruled over Kurukṣetra. Once when there was a famine
in the land, King Malayaprabha exempted his subjects
from all taxes. The greedy ministers did not like it and
[Page472-a+ 65]
they advised him against it. The King yielded to the
advice of his ministers. On one occasion Malayaprabha's
son Induprabha pleaded with his father and told him
that he should not oppress his subjects at the instigation
of his evil ministers. He added that the King was their
“Kalpavṛkṣa” and the subjects were his “Kāmadhenus.”
But the King did not heed the advice of his son. He
jokingly said that Induprabha was also their “Kalpa-
vṛkṣa”. Stung by this taunt, Induprabha took a solemn
oath that he would either become a “Kalpavṛkṣa” or
lay down his life in the attempt. He left the palace at
once and began an austere tapas. Indra was pleased and
appeared before him. Receiving his blessing, Induprabha
returned to his capital and stood there as a “Kalpa-
vṛkṣa”. He fulfilled the desires of the people. A few days
later, Indra came to the tree to test Induprabha. He
told Induprabha: “Your mission of service is over; now
you may come to Heaven”. But he insisted that his
subjects also should be taken with him to Heaven. Indra
was pleased at the devotion and love of Induprabha for
his subjects and agreed to take all his subjects also with
him. Induprabha gave up the form of the tree and
resuming his own shape, accepted “Bodhisattvācārya”.
