PĀṆḌU I¦. Father of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Refer to the genealogy of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śantanu, a King of Candravaṃśa, had two
wives, Gaṅgā and Satyavatī. Even while Satyavatī was
a maiden she got of the sage Parāśara a son named
Vyāsa. But because of the blessing of the sage Satya-
vatī did not lose her maidenhood. She got of Śantanu
two sons, Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya. Citrāṅgada
died young. Vicitravīrya married the two daughters,
Ambikā and Ambālikā, of the King of Kāśī. Vicitra-
vīrya died before any progeny was born to him. To
save the dynasty from extinction Satyavatī asked her
first son Vyāsa to beget children of Ambikā and
Ambālikā. Accordingly Dhṛtarāṣṭra was born to
Ambikā of Vyāsa and Pāṇḍu to Ambālikā. (Chapters
63 and 105, Ādi Parva)
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Pāṇḍu got his name.%} Vyāsa came to Hastinā-
pura by the command of his mother to beget sons of
Ambikā and Ambālikā. Vyāsa was an ugly sage with
matted hair and he was dressed in garments of
deerskin. Satyavatī that night called Ambikā to her
side and in secret commanded her to go and lie with
Vyāsa. She was reluctant to have a sexual union with
that old and ugly sage. Yet obeying the orders of her
mother-in-law she did so shutting her eyes during the
whole period. The result was she got a child born
blind who became known later as Dhṛtarāṣṭra. The
next day Satyavatī ordered Ambālikā to go and lie
with Vyāsa. Ambālikā on entering the bed chamber
went pale on seeing the ugly Vyāsa and the result was
she got a child that was pale white in colour. That
child became known as Pāṇḍu. The third day Satya-
vatī asked her servant-maid to go and lie with Vyāsa.
She did it with pleasure and she remained happy and
cheerful during the whole period. The result was she got
a beautiful child who became an intelligent scholar of
great wisdom. He was known later as Vidura. (Chap-
ters 1, 63, and 105, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boyhood and kingship.%} Bhīṣma took care of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura as his own sons. Bhīṣma
taught them all the Vedas including Dhanurveda, and
[Page564-b+ 65]
all warfare like mace-fight. They were trained in the
use of elephants also. Bhīṣma taught them law and
acquainted them with all the Itihāsas and Purāṇas.
Pāṇḍu became second to none in archery. The people
were all happy. When the boyhood was over Pāṇḍu
was crowned as Yuvarāja. Pāṇḍu was the most eligible
of the three to become King, for Dhṛtarāṣṭra was a
born blind man and Vidura was the son of a servant-
maid. (Chapter 109, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Married life.%} Obeying the behest of Bhīṣma, Pāṇḍu
married Pṛthā, daughter of the Yādava King Śūrasena.
She was the sister of Vasudeva, father of Kṛṣṇa. She
got the name Kuntī because she grew up in the palace
of King Kuntibhoja. While Kuntī was staying in the
palace of Kuntibhoja Durvāsas came and stayed in the
the palace as a guest of the King. Kuntī then served
the sage with such devotion and patience that Durvā-
sas at the time of his departure gave Kuntī a divine
mantra for begetting children. The mantra was to be
used only five times. If she called upon any god
repeating that mantra, that god would manifest himself
before her and bless her with a son equal to him in
glory. Out of impatient curiosity of youth Kuntī tried
it before getting married. One morning, seeing the
beautiful and brilliant sun in the sky she invoked him
by the mantra and instantly the Sun stood in all
bewitching brilliance before her and she got of him a
son who was known as Karṇa later. Unmarried as she
was, Kuntī sent the child afloat in the river nearby.
<div n="NI"/>Even after a child-birth Kuntī remained a virgin by
the blessing of the Sun and so got married as a virgin.
Many Kings were present for the Svayaṃvara of
Kuntī and she put the wedding garland round the neck
of Pāṇḍu.
<div n="NI"/>Once Bhīṣma went to the country of Madra. The King
of Madra received Bhīṣma with respect and Bhīṣma
took Mādrī daughter of Madra as a bride for Pāṇḍu.
He brought her to Hastināpura and married her to
Pāṇḍu. Pāṇḍu lived with his two wives happily and
ruled the country well. Once Pāṇḍu attacked Daśārṇa
with a huge army and defeated him. Later he defeated
Dīrgha, King of Magadha. Then he conducted a
victory march capturing many kingdoms like Kāśī,
Mithilā, Suhma and Puṇḍra. Thus many of the Kings
of Uttara Bhārata became feudatory princes of Pāṇḍu.
In consultation with his brother Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu
gave all the wealth he got by his might to Satyavatī
and Bhīṣma. He gave enough riches to Vidura also.
Then Pāṇḍu went and stayed with his wives in a
forest to the south of the Himālayas. (Chapters 110 to
114, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Curse of a sage.%} While Pāṇḍu was once walking
with his wives in the forest he saw a couple of deer
playfully running about and the hunting nature in
him made him send an arrow against one of them. The
deer was none other than the sage Kindama who in
the guise of a deer was having sport with his mate.
While falling dead Kindama cursed Pāṇḍu thus “Oh
wretched King, you will fall dead the moment you
touch your wife in amorous sport.” From that day
onwards Pāṇḍu could not touch his wives. (For details
see under Kindama).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Sannyāsa and death.%} With the death of the innocent
sage Kindama there occurred a great change in the
life of Pāṇḍu. At first he thought of committing suicide.
[Page565-a+ 64]
But he changed that decision and started for the
Himālayas to perform penance there. Kuntī and
Mādrī accompanied him. They gave away all their
jewels and ornaments as gifts to brahmins. People
followed them to the border of the forests and returned
to the country weeping. Pāṇḍu and his wives visited
such holy places as Nāgaśatādri, Caitraratha, Kālakūṭa,
Himālayas, Gandhamādana and the lake Indradyumna.
Then they went to Śataśṛṅga and started performing
penance. Once Pāṇḍu and wives along with a few
sages went to Brahmaloka to attend a Yāga there. The
long travel toiled them much and on the way Pāṇḍu
wept thinking of his pitiable state of having no issue.
Then Pāṇḍu told them of his helplessness in the matter
because of the curse of the sage Kindama hanging over
him. Then Kuntī confided in him the secret of the
divine mantras in her possession. Pāṇḍu was extremely
pleased and with his permission Kuntī got three sons,
Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīmasena and Arjuna. She gave one
chance to Mādrī and she got two sons out of it named
Nakula and Sahadeva.
<div n="NI"/>Pāṇḍu was living happily with his children in Śataśṛṅga
when spring time arrived in the forest with all its
blossoming brilliance and fragrance conducive to
amorous thoughts in all living beings. Pāṇḍu one day
walked alone with Mādrī enjoying the sight of the
flowering plants and trees. Bees and Beetles hummed
around the flowers and on the branches sat the Cuckoos
singing. There was a seductive fragrance all around and
Pāṇḍu was excited beyond controllable limits. Pāṇḍu's
resolution broke down under the exhilarating influence
of the season and despite repeated protests from Mādrī,
Pāṇḍu caught hold of her and embraced her. The
curse of the sage took effect instantaneously and
Pāṇḍu fell down dead.
<div n="NI"/>The inhabitants of Śataśṛṇga assembled there weeping.
In the presence of a huge crowd including the relatives
who had come down from Hastināpura the dead body
of Pāṇḍu was cremated according to religious rites.
Both the wives came forward to end their lives in the
funeral pyre of Pāṇḍu. But Kuntī was asked to remain
to take care of the children and Mādrī leaving her
children to the care of Kuntī jumped into the funeral
pyre and ended her life. It was the sage Kaśyapa who
performed the funeral rites of Pānḍḍu. (Chapters 115 to
126, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%After the demise.%} Pāṇḍu's soul is shining in the
court of Yama. (Śloka 25, Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva).
Pāṇḍu sent a message to Yudhiṣṭhira from Devaloka
that Yudhiṣṭhira should conduct a Rājasūya Yajña.
The message was carried by Nārada. (Śloka 24,
Chapter 12, Sabhā Parva). He lives in Indraloka with
Mādrī and Kuntī. (Śloka 15, Chapter 5, Svargārohaṇa
Parva).
