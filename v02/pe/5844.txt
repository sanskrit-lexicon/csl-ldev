RUMAṆVĀN II¦. The eldest of the five sons born to
Jamadagni by his wife Reṇukā. The sons of Jamadagni
were, Rumaṇvān, Suṣeṇa, Vasu, Viśvāvasu and
Paraśurāma. It was Rumaṇvān that Jamadagni ordered
to kill Reṇukā who was late in fetching water from the
river. But Rumaṇvān did not obey his father. The
angry hermit cursed Rumaṇvān. According to the curse
Rumaṇvān became dull-witted like birds and beasts.
