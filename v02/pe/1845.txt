DEVAPRATIṢṬHĀ¦. The sacred rite of installation of
<div n="lb"/>Devas (idols) in temples for which definite rules have
<div n="lb"/>been laid down by great ācāryas. According to the
<div n="lb"/>rules Vāsudevamūrti is to be installed in the centre of
<div n="lb"/>the pañcāyatanas. (the Śrī kovil—the sanctum sancto-
<div n="lb"/>rium and the four paths used for the procession of the
<div n="lb"/>deity, around it). The mūrtis Vāmana, Narasiṃha,
<div n="lb"/>Hayagrīva and Varāha are to be installed in the zones
[Page211-b+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>(corners) dominated by Agni, Nirṛti, Vāyu and Īśāna
<div n="lb"/>respectively. Nārāyaṇamūrti should be installed at the
<div n="lb"/>centre of the prāsāda. Ambikā should be installed in
<div n="lb"/>Agni's corner, Āditya in Nirṛti's corner, Brahmā in Vāyu's
<div n="lb"/>corner and Śivaliṅga in the Īśāna corner. Liṅga in the
<div n="lb"/>form of Rudra should also be installed in the Īśāna
<div n="lb"/>corner; or it may be installed in all the nine corners or
<div n="lb"/>zones. In that case Vāsudevamūrti should be installed at
<div n="lb"/>the centre. All the Devas bearing the name Rāma
<div n="lb"/>must be installed to the east of the Prāsāda. Lokapāla-
<div n="lb"/>kas like Indra should be installed at the eight places
<div n="lb"/>starting with the east. In Pañcāyatana pratiṣṭhā Puru-
<div n="lb"/>ṣottama should be installed at the centre. Mahālakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>and Vaiśravaṇa are to be installed to the east of the
<div n="lb"/>Prāsāda, and the Mātṛs in the south. Subrahmaṇya,
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati, Īśāna and the planets (grahaṣ) like Sun
<div n="lb"/>should be installed in the west. Daśāvatāramūrtis (ten
<div n="lb"/>incarnations of Viṣṇu) should be installed in the North.
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍikā should be installed in Agni's zone, Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>in Vāyu's zone, Ambīkā in Nirṛti's zone and Śrī Bhaga-
<div n="lb"/>vatī in Īśāna zone. In temples with thirteen Ālayas
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu should be installed at the centre. Mūrtis like
<div n="lb"/>Keśava should be in the east.
<div n="NI"/>Devapratimās (idols) are of seven varieties like those
<div n="lb"/>made of earth, of wood, of metals, of gems, of sandal
<div n="lb"/>wood, of stone and of flowers. Of the above, idols made
<div n="lb"/>of earth, sandalwood and of flowers are meant only for
<div n="lb"/>temporary use, but they also grant all the desires of the
<div n="lb"/>devotees.
<div n="NI"/>Stone for idols should be got from mountains. Pāṇḍura
<div n="lb"/>(white), Aruṇa (red), Pīta (yellow) and Kṛṣṇa (black)-
<div n="lb"/>rocks having any one of these four colours may be
<div n="lb"/>selected. If no such stone is available any other stone
<div n="lb"/>may be used, but by doing homa and reciting Narasiṃha
<div n="lb"/>mantra the attributes of any of the specified varṇas
<div n="lb"/>should be transferred to it. It is best to have white
<div n="lb"/>markings on the stone selected for the idol. There are
<div n="lb"/>the three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter with
<div n="lb"/>reference to stones. Stone which produces the sound of
<div n="lb"/>bell metal on being hit and gives out sparks of fire on
<div n="lb"/>being cut is of the masculine gender. Stone which
<div n="lb"/>possesses these attributes to a lesser degree is of the
<div n="lb"/>feminine gender. Stone with no shape is of neuter gen-
<div n="lb"/>der. Beside these three varieties there are the sagarbha
<div n="lb"/>(pregnant) stones also, viz. stones with round markings
<div n="lb"/>on them, and they should not be used for making idols.
<div n="lb"/>Once it is decided to make an idol, Vanayajña should
<div n="lb"/>be performed first. To worship the forest from which
<div n="lb"/>the stone for the idol was to be obtained is vanayajña.
<div n="lb"/>A specified place in the forest should be dug up, the
<div n="lb"/>pit treated with cow-dung and a small platform raised
<div n="lb"/>and Viṣṇu worshipped thereon. After sacrificial offerings
<div n="lb"/>etc. instruments for the construction of the idol like
<div n="lb"/>ṭaṅka (chisel) should be worshipped. To sprinkle on
<div n="lb"/>the stone śālitoya (water in which paddy grains are
<div n="lb"/>put) purified with the chanting of astramantra is the
<div n="lb"/>next step. After that bhūtabali (offerings to the spirits
<div n="lb"/>of the stone) should be performed upon which the
<div n="lb"/>bhūtas residing inside the stone will quit. Then the
<div n="lb"/>ācārya should go to sleep repeating the svapna mantra.

<Poem>Oṃ namaḥ sakalalokāya Viṣṇave prabhaviṣṇave /
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāya viśvarūpāya svapnādhipataye namaḥ //
<div n="lb"/>Ācakṣva devadeveśa prasuptosmi tavāntikam /
<div n="lb"/>Svapne sarvāni kāryāṇi hṛdistāni tu yāni me //
<div n="lb"/>Om Om hum phaṭ viṣṇave svāhā.</Poem></F>

<div n="lb"/>If he dreams good dreams everything is quite right;
<div n="lb"/>if bad dreams are dreamt, the next morning narasiṃha-
<div n="lb"/>homa should be performed, the stone given offerings
<div n="lb"/>with chanting of astramantra. The edge of the instru-
<div n="lb"/>ments used for sculpturing the idol should be firstly
<div n="lb"/>smeared with ghee, honey etc. The architect should be
<div n="lb"/>one who has gained mastery over the senses. He should
<div n="lb"/>first cut the stone into a square, and then it should be
<div n="lb"/>placed on a chariot, covered with cloth and taken to
<div n="lb"/>his house. Then after performing a pūjā the work on
<div n="lb"/>the idol should be started. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 43).
