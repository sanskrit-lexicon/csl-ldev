PṚTHU II¦. A virtuous brahmin of good conduct.
Once when Pṛthu was travelling he met five ugly
devils. They became devils for their sins of not doing
any charity and behaving rudely with beggars. Pṛthu
gave them advice on āhāra (food), ācāra (conduct)
and vrata (vow) so that they might get salvation from
their devil-lives. (Chapter 27, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, Padma
Purāṇa).
