ŚĀṆḌILYA III¦. A King, a great devotee of Śiva. As a
<div n="lb"/>youth he became a philanderer with the result that
<div n="lb"/>the honour of women was in jeopardy. The King being
<div n="lb"/>a devotee of Śiva even Yama could not punish him. At
<div n="lb"/>last, when Śiva came to know of the immorality of his
<div n="lb"/>devotee he cursed the King to be turned into a
<div n="lb"/>tortoise for thousand years.
