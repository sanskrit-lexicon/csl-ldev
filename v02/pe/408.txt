ARAKKILLAM¦. (Palace of wax). Both the Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>and the Pāṇḍava princes lived in Hastināpura. The
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas became experts in archery, and their exemplary
<div n="lb"/>character and conduct made them, so to say, the apple
<div n="lb"/>of their eyes to the people. This evoked great jealousy
<div n="lb"/>in Duryodhana who made up his mind to completely
<div n="lb"/>ruin the Pāṇḍavas somehow or other. Duryodhana, with
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra's consent, built a new palace at Vāraṇā-
<div n="lb"/>vata. Though many others did not know that the
<div n="lb"/>palace was made of wax the Pāṇḍavas, from secret
<div n="lb"/>information knew the fact. But, they only pretended
<div n="lb"/>ignorance. Duryodhana and his minister Purocana,
<div n="lb"/>saw to it that the Pāṇḍavas shifted their residence to
<div n="lb"/>the waxen palace. Duryodhana had planned to set fire
<div n="lb"/>to the palace and burn to death the Pāṇḍavas. But, the
<div n="lb"/>shrewd Vidura through his messenger Kanaka gave
<div n="lb"/>notice of the conspiracy to the Pāṇḍavas just in time.
<div n="lb"/>One night Purocana set fire to the waxen palace, but
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas escaped by a secret passage, which the
<div n="lb"/>architect of the palace had made while constructing
<div n="lb"/>it, and about which the Pāṇḍavas had previous know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge. The same night a huntsman, with his five children,
<div n="lb"/>was also staying in the palace. As they were uncon-
<div n="lb"/>scious with heavy dosage of liquor they could not es-
<div n="lb"/>cape the fire. Those six people, and accidentally
<div n="lb"/>Purocana too were burnt to death. People, who gather-
<div n="lb"/>ed at the spot, thus saw seven corpses, and the news
<div n="lb"/>was broadcast that the Pāṇḍavas, including their wife
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī and their mother had been burnt to death.
<div n="lb"/>This incident took place one year after the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>had shifted their residence to the waxen palace. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapters 141-151).
