MŪṢIKA¦. An ancient merchant. In the Kathāpīṭha-
<div n="lb"/>lambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara a story is told to demon-
<div n="lb"/>strate that even without any capital an ingenious and
<div n="lb"/>industrious man can earn money.
<div n="NI"/>A merchant got this name by means of his industry.
<div n="lb"/>Once a poor man of no resources went to the house of
<div n="lb"/>a great merchant named Viśākhila. He was then ad-
<div n="lb"/>monishing a young man of his own caste. The merchant
<div n="lb"/>was saying, “See, here is a dead rat on the ground. A
<div n="lb"/>clever man would earn money by using this as a capital.
<div n="lb"/>To you I have given money for business on several
<div n="lb"/>occasions. Not only that you have not increased it but
<div n="lb"/>also you have lost it.”
<div n="NI"/>The poor man who went to him requested the merchant
<div n="lb"/>to give him the dead rat. Viśākhila greatly amused at
<div n="lb"/>the request gave him the rat. A rich man bought it for
<div n="lb"/>his cat to eat and gave him instead two measures of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal gram. He roasted it and made it palatable and
<div n="lb"/>then with a pot of water went outside the city gates and
<div n="lb"/>sat under a tree on the road-side. Wood-cutters were
<div n="lb"/>passing that way carrying loads and he sold the
<div n="lb"/>roasted gram and water to them who purchased it with
<div n="lb"/>eagerness to ease their weariness. They gave him in
<div n="lb"/>exchange firewood and in the evening he took it to
<div n="lb"/>the market and sold it. With the money he purchased
<div n="lb"/>more Bengal gram and continued the trade as before and
<div n="lb"/>after a few days he purchased from them a great stock
[Page512-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>of firewood. Suddenly there were heavy rains and there
<div n="lb"/>was a scarcity of firewood in the market and he sold
<div n="lb"/>his stock for good price. With the money thus received
<div n="lb"/>he purchased some goods and started a grocery shop.
<div n="lb"/>Gradually his business increased and he became a big
<div n="lb"/>merchant. Because he started the business from a Mūṣika
<div n="lb"/>(rat) he got the nick-name Mūṣika.
