<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descended from Mahāviṣṇu in
<div n="lb"/>the following order: Brahmā-Marīci-Kaśyapa-Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu-Pṛahlāda-Virocana-Mahābali-Bāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Getting a boon.%} Bāṇa began his reign with the city
<div n="lb"/>of Śoṇitapura as his capital. Then he went to the
<div n="lb"/>vicinity of the Himālayas and began to do penance
<div n="lb"/>thinking of Śiva. Śiva made his appearance and asked
<div n="lb"/>him what he wanted. He requested that he should be
<div n="lb"/>considered as the son of Pārvatī and that he should be
<div n="lb"/>given thousand hands so as to destroy all his enemies.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva granted him the boon. From that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī considered him as the younger brother of
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya. He returned to his Kingdom and began
<div n="lb"/>to reign.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Battle with Śrī Kṛṣṇa and his fall.%} (See the word
<div n="lb"/>Aniruddha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%} (1) In the Purāṇas Bāṇāsura is
<div n="lb"/>often called by the name Mahākāla, which is the name
<div n="lb"/>of an attendant of Śiva. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>65, Stanza 20).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Śukrācārya (the teacher of the Asuras) always
<div n="lb"/>worked for the uplift of Bāṇa. (M.B., Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 38, Stanza 29).
<div n="NI"/>(3) In the Battle with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Bāṇa was helped by
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, Subrahmaṇya, and the Gods like Agni (fire) and
<div n="lb"/>others. (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Śrī Kṛṣṇa cut down the thousand hands of Bāṇa
<div n="lb"/>with his Cakrāyudha (the wheel weapon). (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Bāṇa often stood under the cover of the mountain
<div n="lb"/>of Krauñca and attacked the devas (gods). So once
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya had to cut the mountain Krauñca with
<div n="lb"/>his arrows. (M.B., Śalya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>82).
