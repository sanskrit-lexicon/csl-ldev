PUṢKARAMĀLINĪ¦. A very virtuous woman. She was
the wife of a sage named Satya who lived on alms in
the country of Vidarbha. Because she was very strict and
perfect in the observance of vratas she became lean
but pure. She was very obedient to her husband and
she made her own dress out of peacock feathers gather-
ed from forests. Puṣkaramālinī was against sacrificing
cows in yajñas. (Chapter 246, Śānti Parva).
