VIJAYALAKṢMĪ¦. One of the eight Lakṣmīs. The duty
<div n="lb"/>of Vijayalakṣmī was keeping the treasury of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Once she showed carelessness in her duty. So Brahmā
[Page854-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>cursed her to go and guard the gate tower of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Vijayalakṣmī guarded the gate of Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>under the name Laṅkālakṣmī. When she was hit by
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān she obtained her original form and returned
<div n="lb"/>to the world of Devas. (See under Laṅkālakṣmī).
