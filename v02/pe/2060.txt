ḌIṂḌIKA¦. A rat who played a part in Biḍālopākhyāna.
<div n="lb"/>The story runs as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Once a cat performed tapas, holding his hands up, on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the Ganges, when the found no way to get
<div n="lb"/>food. Seeing the devotion of that cat all living beings
<div n="lb"/>birds and animals began to worship him. Once the cat
<div n="lb"/>called all rats and told them: “One cannot do spiritual
<div n="lb"/>and physical deeds at the same time. So I will look after
<div n="lb"/>your spiritual affairs. You should attend to my
<div n="lb"/>physical needs. That is, bring me food, bathe me in
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges, all these are your duties.”
<div n="NI"/>The rats agreed to do so. They took him to the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges, bathed him and gave him food. But, the cat,
<div n="lb"/>whenever he got a chance caught a rat and ate it up
<div n="lb"/>The cat's health improved day-by-day and the number
<div n="lb"/>of rat's began to decrease. Among them, there was a
<div n="lb"/>clever rat named Ḍimḍika. He called all the other rats
[Page242-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and organized a secret conference. The subject of
<div n="lb"/>discussion was the cruel deeds done by the cat to the
<div n="lb"/>rats.
<div n="NI"/>The next day Ḍiṃḍika went secretly to examine the
<div n="lb"/>ways of living of the cat. The cat ate Ḍiṃḍika. After
<div n="lb"/>40 days the rats came to know that Ḍiṃḍika was
<div n="lb"/>missing. They assembled secretly. They elected a rat
<div n="lb"/>named Kokila as their leader. Under his leadership
<div n="lb"/>the rats declared independence and left the place. The
<div n="lb"/>cat also went his own way finding no means to get food.
