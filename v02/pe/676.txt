head once. This act is called Ācamana.

<div n="NI"/>Devī Bhāgavata in its eleventh Skandha says about
Ācamana like this: “Drinking water by your right hand
is called ācamana. Curve your palm into the shape of

not less nor more. If it falls short or exceeds the mea-
sure it is considered to be like drinking alcohol. While

shaping your palm neither your little finger nor your
thumb should touch the other fingers. At the time of
ācamana you should support your right hand by your
left hand. Otherwise the water will turn impure.”
