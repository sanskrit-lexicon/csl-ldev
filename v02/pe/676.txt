ĀCAMANA¦. First drink water three times accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by incantations and then with water wipe your face
<div n="lb"/>twice and your eyes, ears, nose, shoulders, breast and
<div n="lb"/>head once. This act is called Ācamana.
<Poem>“Trirācamedapaḥ pūrvaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Dviḥ pramṛjyāttato mukhaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Khāni caiva spṛśedabhir
<div n="lb"/>Ātmānaṃ śira eva ca”</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Manusmṛti, Śloka 60, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>Devī Bhāgavata in its eleventh Skandha says about
<div n="lb"/>Ācamana like this: “Drinking water by your right hand
<div n="lb"/>is called ācamana. Curve your palm into the shape of
<div n="lb"/>a spoon, hold water in it and drink. There must be
<div n="lb"/>enough water in the palm to cover a green-gram seed,
<div n="lb"/>not less nor more. If it falls short or exceeds the mea-
<div n="lb"/>sure it is considered to be like drinking alcohol. While
[Page086-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>shaping your palm neither your little finger nor your
<div n="lb"/>thumb should touch the other fingers. At the time of
<div n="lb"/>ācamana you should support your right hand by your
<div n="lb"/>left hand. Otherwise the water will turn impure.”
