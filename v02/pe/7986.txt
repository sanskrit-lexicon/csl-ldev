place in the Purāṇas. Considering them as born in the
family of Hanūmān, an ardent devotee of Śrī Rāma,

leaders of the monkeys were Bāli, Sugrīva, Aṅgada,
Mainda, Gavaya, Dvivida, Gavākṣa, Gaja, Śarabha,
Sūryākṣa, Hanūmān, Vidyunmālī, Vīrabāhu, Subāhu,
Nala, Kumuda, Jāmbavān, Tāra, Supāṭala, Sunetra,

in the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga
33. “Mahendra mountain, the Himālayas, the Vindhya
mountain, the peaks of Kailāsa and Śveta mountain,
Mandara mountain etc. are the places mostly inhabit-
ed by monkeys. On the mountains shining like the
rising sun, on the east of the western ocean also monkeys
live. The Monkeys which inhabit black soil are blue
in colour. Monkeys which live in red arsenic caves
are yellow in colour. Those which live in Mahā Meru
and Dhūmra (smoky) mountain have the colour of the
rising sun and are drunkards.”
