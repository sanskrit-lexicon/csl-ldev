CATURIKĀ¦. A harlot about whom the following story
is told in Kathāsaritsāgara.
<div n="NI"/>Once a poor Brahmin got a piece of gold as Pratigraha
(fee or dakṣiṇā for performing a religious rite). While
he was perplexed not knowing what to do with the gold,
a Viṭa advised him to go on tour with the money got by
[Page179-a+ 65]
selling the gold. The poor Brahmin did not even know
how to go on tour. Then the Viṭa advised him to visit a
harlot called Caturikā, who lived close by and who,
the Vita said, would teach him how to go on tour.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmin:—What shall I do first after going to the
harlot's house?
<div n="NI"/>Viṭa:—Caturikā will become friendly if you would
give her the gold. Then you should use sweet and charm-
ing words, and that is all.
<div n="NI"/>The Brahmin went immediately to Caturikā's house and
he was received honourably by her. Then giving the
gold to her he requested her to instruct him about going
on tour. This request of his evoked laughter from people
around him. Then the Brahmin who was versed in the
Śrutis began reciting the Sāman with his palm formed
in the shape of the ears of the cow. All those who were
present there wildly laughed at him, and somehow or
other he escaped from the none too pleasant scene, and
reported his experience at the harlot's to the Viṭa.
He very easily understood that the reason for the Brah-
min being ridiculed was that misreading his advice to
use ‘sāma’ (sweet words) the Brahmin recited the sāma-
veda. He took the brahmin back to Caturikā and asked
her to return the ‘grass’ (gold given her by the brah-
min) to ‘the cow’, the Brahmin who was as simple as
the cow. Laughingly Caturikā returned the gold to
him. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭha Laṃbakam, Ta-
raṅga 6).
