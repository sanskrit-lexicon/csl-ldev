CATURIKĀ¦. A harlot about whom the following story
<div n="lb"/>is told in Kathāsaritsāgara.
<div n="NI"/>Once a poor Brahmin got a piece of gold as Pratigraha
<div n="lb"/>(fee or dakṣiṇā for performing a religious rite). While
<div n="lb"/>he was perplexed not knowing what to do with the gold,
<div n="lb"/>a Viṭa advised him to go on tour with the money got by
[Page179-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>selling the gold. The poor Brahmin did not even know
<div n="lb"/>how to go on tour. Then the Viṭa advised him to visit a
<div n="lb"/>harlot called Caturikā, who lived close by and who,
<div n="lb"/>the Vita said, would teach him how to go on tour.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmin:—What shall I do first after going to the
<div n="lb"/>harlot's house?
<div n="NI"/>Viṭa:—Caturikā will become friendly if you would
<div n="lb"/>give her the gold. Then you should use sweet and charm-
<div n="lb"/>ing words, and that is all.
<div n="NI"/>The Brahmin went immediately to Caturikā's house and
<div n="lb"/>he was received honourably by her. Then giving the
<div n="lb"/>gold to her he requested her to instruct him about going
<div n="lb"/>on tour. This request of his evoked laughter from people
<div n="lb"/>around him. Then the Brahmin who was versed in the
<div n="lb"/>Śrutis began reciting the Sāman with his palm formed
<div n="lb"/>in the shape of the ears of the cow. All those who were
<div n="lb"/>present there wildly laughed at him, and somehow or
<div n="lb"/>other he escaped from the none too pleasant scene, and
<div n="lb"/>reported his experience at the harlot's to the Viṭa.
<div n="lb"/>He very easily understood that the reason for the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min being ridiculed was that misreading his advice to
<div n="lb"/>use ‘sāma’ (sweet words) the Brahmin recited the sāma-
<div n="lb"/>veda. He took the brahmin back to Caturikā and asked
<div n="lb"/>her to return the ‘grass’ (gold given her by the brah-
<div n="lb"/>min) to ‘the cow’, the Brahmin who was as simple as
<div n="lb"/>the cow. Laughingly Caturikā returned the gold to
<div n="lb"/>him. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭha Laṃbakam, Ta-
<div n="lb"/>raṅga 6).
