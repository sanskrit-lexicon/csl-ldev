NARAKA I¦. (NARAKĀSURA). A valiant Asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Once the Asura Hiraṇyākṣa was amusing
himself by wading through the ocean and beating at
the waves with his club. Varuṇa, the god of water, was
alarmed at this and ran to Mahāviṣṇu and told him
every thing. Hearing this Mahāviṣṇu got up to kill
Hiraṇyākṣa. Hiraṇyākṣa who had assumed the form of
a Boar carried the earth on his tusks and ran to Pātāla.
As the goddess earth had come into contact with the
tusks of Hiraṇyākṣa she became pregnant and gave birth
to an asura infant of immense might and power. That
infant was Narakāsura.
<div n="NI"/>Taking the infant born from impurity the sad goddess
Earth went to Mahāviṣṇu and requested him to save
the child somehow. Mahāviṣṇu pitied him and gave
him Nārāyaṇāstra (Nārāyaṇa's weapon) and said:
“Naraka! So long as this weapon is with you, nobody
but me could kill you.” Saying this he disappeared.
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Administration.%} Narakāsura made Prāgjyotiṣa his
capital and ruled over the asuras as their emperor for
a long time, all the while terrifying the Devas. Once
this asura raped Kaśerū the daughter of Tvaṣṭā. He
brought sixteen thousand and one hundred maidens
from the women of the earth and the world of gods. He
made them captives at Audaka on the top of the
mountain Maṇiparvata. He appointed four mighty and
fearful asuras: Hayagrīva, Nisunda, Pañcanada and
Mura as gate-keepers of Prāgjyotiṣa. As they stood
blocking the way up to Devayāna, nobody dared to
enter Prāgjyotiṣa. The ten sons of Narakāsura guarded
the harem. At the boundary of the country Murāsura
had tied six thousand ropes with a sword at the end of
each. So enemies dared not come near the boundary.
When Sugrīva gave instructions to the monkeys who
were sent in search of Sītā, about the route they were
to follow, he had mentioned about the city of Prāg-
jyotiṣa. Mention is made in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 42 that Sugrīva had given
them special instructions to search for Sītā in Prāg-
jyotiṣa. (M.B. Viṣṇu Parva, Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Previous birth of Naraka.%} Long ago a king who was
the father of Sixteen thousand daughters, ruled over a
country. While the father and daughters were sitting in
the palace Mahāviṣṇu came there as a hermit. The
sixteen thousand damsels gathered round the hermit.
Their father got angry and cursed them. The daughters
shed tears and entreated their father for liberation from
the curse. He gave them remission and said that in the
next birth they would become wives of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>Another version of this story says that the damsels had
requested Brahmā for liberation from the curse
according to the advice of the hermit Nārada, and
that Brahmā had given them liberation from the curse.
In some versions it is stated that Nārada himself gave
them liberation from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>It was this King, who was the father of the sixteen
thousand damsels, who took birth again as Narakāsura.
Those sixteen thousand damsels who had been born as
princesses in different places were taken captives by
Narakāsura and were kept in Audaka. (Bhāgavata,
[Page531-b+ 65]
Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} Narakāsura who had been causing devast-
ation and terror in the three worlds entered the world
of the gods once. The gods were not able to withstand
the fury of Naraka, who carried away the ear-rings of
Aditi, the mother of Indra, and the large white royal
umbrella of Indra to Prāgjyotiṣa. Indra went to Dvārakā
and told Śrī Kṛṣṇa of the molestations he had received
at the hands of Narakāsura. Śrī Kṛṣṇa rode on his
Garuḍa with his wife Satyabhāmā to Prāgjyotiṣa. They
flew over the city round and understood the lay-out of
the city, and the precautions taken by Narakāsura. The
battle began after this reconnaissance. Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
Satyabhāmā and Garuḍa fought with the asuras. The
might asuras such as Mura, Tāmra, Antarīkṣa, Śravaṇa,
Vasu, Vibhāvasu, Nabhasvān, Aruṇa and others were
killed. At last Narakāsura himself entered the battle-
field. A fierce battle ensued in which Naraka was killed.
The divine weapon Nārāyaṇāstra of Naraka was given
to his son Bhagadatta. After the battle Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
Satyabhāmā went to the world of the gods and returned
the ear-rings to Aditi and the umbrella to Indra.
