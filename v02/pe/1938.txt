DHARMADATTA II¦. A Brahmin who lived in the city
of Karavīra. One day while Dharmadatta was going to
the temple with material for pūjā he came across a
demoness named Kalahā on the way. The brahmin
threw the pūjā materials in his hand on to the face of
the demoness. When a tulasī leaf touched the demoness
she got back the memory of her previous birth.
<div n="NI"/>Kalahā then abandoned her cruel nature and begged
Dharmadatta to advise her as to how she should get a
release from her demonaic life. Taking pity on her
Dharmadatta gave her all the ‘puṇya’ he had obtained
by observing Kārttikavrata. (Chapters 106, 107, Uttara
Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa and Chapters 2, 4, 24, 25
Skanda Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Dharmadatta and Kalahā were born as Daśaratha and
Kaikeyī in their next births as a result of the accumulat-
ed Puṇya obtained by observing Kārttikavrata. (Sāra
khaṇḍa, Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa).
