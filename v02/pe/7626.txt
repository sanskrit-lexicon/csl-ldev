TULASĪ¦. (Holy Basil plant.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Tulasī is a plant held most
<div n="lb"/>sacred by the Hindus. There is a Purāṇic background for
<div n="lb"/>Tulasī attaining this spiritualistic importance. In fact
<div n="lb"/>it is Mahālakṣmī, wife of Viṣṇu, who had herself taken
<div n="lb"/>the form of Tulasī. There is a story about it in Devi
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The curse of Sarasvatī.%} Sarasvatī, Gaṅgā and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī were all, in the beginning, wives of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>The Lord loved all the three equally. One day all the
<div n="lb"/>four were sitting together when Gaṅgā sent lustful
<div n="lb"/>glances at Viṣṇu which was immediately noticed by
<div n="lb"/>both Sarasvatī and Lakṣmī. Sarasvatī got angry and
<div n="lb"/>rising up caught hold of the hair of Gaṅgā and dragged
<div n="lb"/>her to the ground. Lakṣmī then caught hold of Saras-
<div n="lb"/>vatī to prevent further assault but Sarasvatī then
<div n="lb"/>poured all her rage on Lakṣmī and cursed her to be
<div n="lb"/>born as a plant on earth. Gaṅgādevī could not bear
<div n="lb"/>this and she cursed Sarasvatī to be born as a river on
<div n="lb"/>earth. Sarasvatī retorted with a curse that Gaṅgā also
<div n="lb"/>would be born as a river. When the whole tumult was
<div n="lb"/>over Viṣṇu called Lakṣmī to his side and said—“Oh
<div n="lb"/>Devī, do not worry. Things have happened as predes-
<div n="lb"/>tined. You go and be born as the daughter of Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja and grow up there. From there by divine grace
<div n="lb"/>you will be transformed into a plant sacred enough to
<div n="lb"/>make all the three worlds pure. That plant will be
<div n="lb"/>named Tulasī. When you will be thus living as Tulasī,
<div n="lb"/>a demon named Śaṅkhacūḍa with part of my virile
<div n="lb"/>strength will be born and he will marry you. Then you
<div n="lb"/>can come back to me. The holy river Padmāvatī will
<div n="lb"/>also be another form of your spirit.”
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The story of Dharmadhvaja.%} Who was this Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja to whom was born Mahālakṣmī as a daughter?
<div n="lb"/>In times of old there was a Manu called Dakṣasāvarṇi
<div n="lb"/>who was extremely virtuous and a part of Viṣṇu. Des-
<div n="lb"/>cending from Dakṣasāvarṇi were Brahmasāvarṇi-
<div n="lb"/>Dharmasāvarṇi-Rudrasāvarṇi-Devasāvarṇi-Indrasāvarṇi
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣadhvaja. This last named was a great devotee of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and because of his great affection for this devotee
<div n="lb"/>Śiva lived a whole period of a devayuga in the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>of Vṛṣadhvaja. King Vṛṣadhvaja by an edict prohibited
<div n="lb"/>the worship of any other deity than Śiva in his country.
<div n="lb"/>Even the worship of Mahālakṣmī ordained by the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>during the month of Bhādra (September) became ex-
<div n="lb"/>tinct. All Yāgas and worship of Viṣṇu came to a stop.
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya (Sun-god) got angry at this belittling of other
<div n="lb"/>gods than Śiva and cursed the King Vṛṣadhvaja that he
<div n="lb"/>would cease to be prosperous. Śiva did not like it and
<div n="lb"/>he went to punish Sūrya holding his trident in his
<div n="lb"/>hand. Sūrya was frightened and he approached his
<div n="lb"/>father Kaśyapa. Kaśyapa and Sūrya went to Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and acquainted him with all details. Brahmā also was
<div n="lb"/>helpless in the matter and so all the three of them went
<div n="lb"/>to Mahāviṣṇu. They prostrated before Viṣṇu and told
<div n="lb"/>him all. At that time Śiva also came there. Addressing
<div n="lb"/>all of them Viṣṇu said “Oh, Devas, within this half an
<div n="lb"/>hour twentyone yugas have passed by on the earth. He
<div n="lb"/>about whom you have come to speak to me is dead and
<div n="lb"/>gone. Even his son Rathadhvaja is dead. The latter
<div n="lb"/>has two sons named Dharmadhvaja and Kuśadhvaja.
<div n="lb"/>They are dull and splendourless now because of the curse
<div n="lb"/>of Sūrya and are now worshipping Lakṣmī.” Saying
<div n="lb"/>thus Viṣṇu disappeared.
[Page798-a+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Tulasī.%} Dharmadhvaja and Kuśadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>did penance to propitiate Mahālakṣmī. Kuśadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>had a wife named Mālāvatī. She bore a daughter named
<div n="lb"/>Vedavatī. Sītā, wife of Śrī Rāma, was a rebirth of this
<div n="lb"/>Vedavatī.
<div n="NI"/>King Dharmadhvaja had a wife named Mādhavī. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī entered her womb as an embryo and after a hund-
<div n="lb"/>red years Mādhavī gave birth to a daughter. Even at the
<div n="lb"/>time of birth the child looked like a matured girl and was
<div n="lb"/>extremely pretty. She was therefore, called Tulasī, meaning
<div n="lb"/>matchless. (Tula=match). This Tulasī abandoning all
<div n="lb"/>worldly pleasures went to Badarikāśrama and started doing
<div n="lb"/>penance there with the prayer that Mahāviṣṇu should
<div n="lb"/>become her husband. She did penance for twentyfour
<div n="lb"/>thousand years sitting amidst fire in the hot season and
<div n="lb"/>sitting in water in the cold season and taking only
<div n="lb"/>fruits and water as food. Then she did penance for ano-
<div n="lb"/>ther thirtythousand years eating leaves only, another forty
<div n="lb"/>thousand years taking air only as food and another ten
<div n="lb"/>thousand years without any food. At this stage Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>appeared and asked her the object of her Penance. She
<div n="lb"/>replied she wanted Mahāviṣṇu to be her husband.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this Brahmā said thus—“Devi, you know the
<div n="lb"/>cowboy Sudāmā born of a part of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. That
<div n="lb"/>brilliant cowboy has now been born on earth, due to a
<div n="lb"/>curse of Rādhā, as a demon named Śaṅkhacūḍa. He is
<div n="lb"/>matchlessly eminent and has once fallen in love with
<div n="lb"/>you seeing you at Goloka. You will become his wife and
<div n="lb"/>later you can become the wife of Nārāyaṇa. At that
<div n="lb"/>time a part of your divine body will remain on earth as
<div n="lb"/>a plant named Tulasī. Tulasī will become the most
<div n="lb"/>sacred of all plants, dear to Viṣṇu, and all worship
<div n="lb"/>without using Tulasī leaves would be ineffective.”
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Marriage of Tulasī.%} Due to a curse of Rādhā,
<div n="lb"/>Sudāmā, the cowboy, was born on earth as a demon
<div n="lb"/>named Śaṅkhacūḍa. He did penance sitting at Badarik-
<div n="lb"/>āśrama and obtained Viṣṇukavaca. Another object of
<div n="lb"/>his was to marry Tulasī. He obtained a boon from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā that his death would occur only when the
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Kavaca was removed from his body and the
<div n="lb"/>chastity of his wife was lost. At that time Śaṅkhacūḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Tulasī met each other in the forests and were
<div n="lb"/>married. Śaṅkhacūḍa, brilliant and majestic, went
<div n="lb"/>about with Tulasī in amorous sports creating jealousy
<div n="lb"/>even among the devas. His arrogance gave innumer-
<div n="lb"/>able troubles to the devas and they along with Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva approached Mahāviṣṇu for a remedy.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu then sent Śiva with his spike to kill Śaṅkhacūḍa
<div n="lb"/>and he himself started to molest the chastity of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Tulasī. Śaṅkhacūda took leave of Tulasī to go
<div n="lb"/>and fight with Śiva. When Tulasī was thus left alone,
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu in the form of Śaṅkhacūḍa approached
<div n="lb"/>Tulasī and after some preliminary talks entered into
<div n="lb"/>sexual acts. Tulasī found some difference in the usual
<div n="lb"/>sexual methods and suspecting foul play jumped up to
<div n="lb"/>curse the impostor. At once Mahāviṣṇu appeared in
<div n="lb"/>his true form and said “You have been doing penance
<div n="lb"/>for a long time to get me as your husband. Your
<div n="lb"/>husband Śaṅkhacūḍa was the chief of my Pārṣadas,
<div n="lb"/>Sudāmā. It is time for him to go back to Goloka get-
<div n="lb"/>ting himself released from the curse. By this time Śiva
<div n="lb"/>would have killed him and he would have gone to
<div n="lb"/>Goloka as Sudāmā. You can now abandon your body
[Page798-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and come with me to Vaikuṇṭha to enjoy life as my
<div n="lb"/>wife.
<div n="NI"/>Your body will decay and become a holy river named
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍakī; your hair will become Tulasī plant the
<div n="lb"/>leaves of which will be held sacred in all the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds.”
<div n="NI"/>Tulasī then changed herself into the form of Lakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>and went to Vaikuṇṭha with Mahāviṣṇu. (9th Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The greatness of Tulasī.%} Everything of the Tulasī
<div n="lb"/>plant, leaves, flowers, fruits, roots, twigs, skin and even
<div n="lb"/>the soil around is holy. The soul of a dead one whose
<div n="lb"/>dead body is cremated using Tulasī twigs for firewood
<div n="lb"/>would attain a permanent place in Viṣṇuloka. Even
<div n="lb"/>great sinners would be absolved of their sins if their
<div n="lb"/>dead bodies are cremated with Tulasī twigs. If at the
<div n="lb"/>time of death one thinks of God and mutters His name
<div n="lb"/>and if his dead body is later cremated with Tulasī
<div n="lb"/>twigs, he would have no rebirths. Even he who has
<div n="lb"/>done a crore of sins would attain mokṣa if at the time
<div n="lb"/>of cremating his dead body a piece of Tulasī twig is
<div n="lb"/>placed at the bottom of the funeral pyre. Just as all
<div n="lb"/>waters become pure by the union with Gaṅgā water,
<div n="lb"/>all firewood is made pure by the addition of a small
<div n="lb"/>piece of Tulasī twig. If the dead body of one is cre-
<div n="lb"/>mated using Tulasī twigs alone, one's sins for a crore
<div n="lb"/>of Kalpa years would be washed away. Yamadūtas
<div n="lb"/>would keep away from one whose dead body is cre-
<div n="lb"/>mated with Tulasī twigs and servants of Viṣṇu would
<div n="lb"/>come near. If a light is burnt for Viṣṇu with a Tulasī
<div n="lb"/>stick it would be equal to burning several lakhs of
<div n="lb"/>lights for Viṣṇu. If one makes the Tulasī leaves into a
<div n="lb"/>paste and smears it on one's body and then worships
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu for one day, one would be getting the benefit of
<div n="lb"/>a hundred ordinary worships and also the benefit of
<div n="lb"/>doing a hundred godānas. (gifts of cows). (Chapter 24,
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa).
