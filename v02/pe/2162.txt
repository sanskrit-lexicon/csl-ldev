DURDAMA¦. Son of a Gandharva called Viśvāvasu.
The following story about him is told in the Skanda
Purāṇa. Chapters 1, 3 and 4).
<div n="NI"/>While maharṣis like Vasiṣṭha and Atri were once
engaged in the worship of Lord Śiva at Mount Kailāsa,
Durdama, with his thousands of wives came there. In
the Hālāsyatīrtha near-by they got engaged in water
sports with their bodies stark naked. On seeing their
naked sports Vasiṣṭha cursed Durdama to be turned
into a Rākṣasa. When his wives begged of Vasiṣṭha for
redemption from the curse he told them that seven-
teen years thence Durdama would regain his old form.
Durdama thus turned Rākṣasa tried once to devour
sage Gālava when the Sudarśana Cakra of Viṣṇu killed
him. He regained his old form and returned to
Gandharvaloka.
