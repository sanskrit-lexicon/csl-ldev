ŚAMBŪKA¦. A Śūdra muni. During the reign of Śrī
Rāma a great number of children died in the country
and many parents wept before the king about the loss of
their offsprings. According to Vasiṣṭha's advice Rāma
enquired whether anybody indulged in actions not
proper to his station in life. Śrī Rāma surveyed the
country from the air in a Vimāna, and during the
survey he found Śambūka, the śūdra muni hanging with
his head down and inhaling smoke from a fire lit under
him. Thus, having found out that the tapas by that
śūdra was the reason for the children's death, Rāma
[Page679-a+ 64]
killed Śambūka immediately. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
Uttarakāṇḍa).
