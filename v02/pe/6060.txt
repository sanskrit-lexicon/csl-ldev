ŚAMBŪKA¦. A Śūdra muni. During the reign of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma a great number of children died in the country
<div n="lb"/>and many parents wept before the king about the loss of
<div n="lb"/>their offsprings. According to Vasiṣṭha's advice Rāma
<div n="lb"/>enquired whether anybody indulged in actions not
<div n="lb"/>proper to his station in life. Śrī Rāma surveyed the
<div n="lb"/>country from the air in a Vimāna, and during the
<div n="lb"/>survey he found Śambūka, the śūdra muni hanging with
<div n="lb"/>his head down and inhaling smoke from a fire lit under
<div n="lb"/>him. Thus, having found out that the tapas by that
<div n="lb"/>śūdra was the reason for the children's death, Rāma
[Page679-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>killed Śambūka immediately. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Uttarakāṇḍa).
