BALI¦ (MAHĀBALI) I. An emperor of the Asuras. He
was the son of Virocana and the grandson of Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} The Asuras or the Daityas are
the sons born, of his wife Diti, to Kaśyapa Prajāpati, son
of Marīci and grandson of Brahmā. There were so
many Asuras born as the sons of Diti. But among them
Hiraṇyākṣa, Hiraṇyakaśipu, Śūrapadmā, Siṃhavaktra,
Tārakāsura and Gomukha were notorious. Of their
sisters Siṃhikā and Ajamukhī were famous.
<div n="NI"/>Four sons called Prahlāda, Saṃhrāda, Hrāda and
Anuhrāda were born to Hiraṇyakaśipu. Virocana was
the son of Prahlāda and Mahābali was the son of Viro-
cana. Bāṇa was born from Mahābali and four crores of
Asuras called Nivātakavacas were born from Bāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The churning of the ocean.%} Once Mahābali had stolen
the wealth of Devendra. While he was carrying it to
his house, it all fell in the ocean. Mahāviṣṇu ordered
the devas (gods) to recover the lost wealth from the
[Page103-b+ 65]
ocean. It was impossible to churn the ocean without
the help of Mahābali. So the devas went to Mahābali
and sought his help. Mahābali agreed to help them.
<div n="NI"/>The real aim of the devas was not to regain the lost
wealth but to obtain the celestial nectar known as Nectar
of Immortality (Amṛta) and to defeat the Asuras in
battle. On the side of the Asuras there was the know-
ledge of the Mṛtasañjīvanī (life-restoring remedy). So
the dead were being brought to life. But it was not
possible for devas to do so. It was to make up this
deficiency, by obtaining Ambrosia from the sea, that
the devas tried to churn the sea, under the pretence of
recovering the lost wealth. Mention is made in the
Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 9 and Matsya Purāṇa,
Chapters 250 and 251 that these events took place
during the regime of the Indra named Mantradruma in
the Cākṣuṣamanvantara (the period of the manu named
Cākṣuṣa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%War with Indra.%} The great teacher Śukra again
anointed Bali, who was brought to life again, as Indra.
After that he performed the sacrifice of Viśvajit (con-
queror of the world) on behalf of Bali. Assuming the
responsibilities of government, Bali performed one
hundred Aśvamedha yāgas (Horse sacrifices) (Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>After the Viśvajit sacrifice, Yajñadeva (god of sacrifice)
who was greatly pleased at the sacrifice, presented Bali
with a divine chariot, equal in all aspects to that of
Indra, a golden bow, two quivers, which would never
become empty and a divine armour, and his grand-
father gave him a garland that would never fade, and
the teacher Śukra gave him a divine conch, and Brahmā
presented a garland. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapter 216).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Attainment of the Position of Indra.%} Mahāviṣṇu had
not been on good terms with the devas, for a time.
Taking this opportunity, Śukrācārya the teacher of the
Asuras, persuaded Bali to engage the devas in a battle.
Bali defeated the devas completely in a pitched battle.
Thus the realm of the gods came under the sway of
Mahābali. Once, during that period Bali invited his
grandfather Prahlāda to heaven and requested him to
accept the most honourable seat there. Prahlāda
accepted his invitation and anointed Bali as Indra. Bali
enquired of Prahlāda as to the method of carrying on
the government of heaven. Prahlāda said thus in reply:
“Only virtue will always win. Rule the kingdom without
deviating from virtue.” (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 74).
Because Bali had ruled his kingdom according to the
advice of Prahlāda, he became famous in the three
worlds. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 75).
<div n="NI"/>According to the version of Bhāgavata, Prahlāda when
he grew old, left his kingdom in the hands of his son
Virocana and went to the forest for penance. Virocana
was not as famous as Prahlāda. After the period of
Virocana, Mahābali came to the throne. He was a
mighty king. Within a short time he became the emperor
of the Asuras. It was during this period that the churn-
ing of the Milk Sea took place. The Asuras and the
Devas (gods) sat on either side and using the mount
Mandara as churn-drill, churned the Milk Sea and
obtained Amṛta (the celestial nectar of immortality).
A battle took place between the Asuras and the Devas
for the possession of Amṛtakalaśa (the Ambrosia and
the container) and the emperor Mahābali was killed in
the battle. The Asuras carried the dead body of Mahā.
[Page104-a+ 65]
bali to his capital, where Śukrācārya (their teacher-pri-
est Śukra) brought him to life again by the help of sacred
herbs. Mahābali instantly waged another war, fiercer
than the previous ones, with the devas, and having
defeated them, he drove them out of their realm and
brought it under control. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The curse of Prahlāda.%} As the whole of heaven came
under the sway of Bali, the devas began to leave the
country one by one. Everybody was happy and comfort-
able under the rule of Bali. But the devas and Brāh-
maṇas were denied the privileges they deserved. They
approached Viṣṇu and represented their grievances.
Viṣṇu told them thus: “Bali is devoted to me. Still, to
redress your grievances I shall take the incarnation of
Vāmana shortly.”
<div n="NI"/>In course of time the Asuras and their countries began
to be weakened. Seeing the approach of destruction
emperor Bali became thoughtful. He approached
Prahlāda to learn the reason. Prahlāda told Bali thus:
“Lord Viṣṇu is now staying in the womb of Aditi for his
incarnation as Vāmana. That is why the country and
the Asuras are subjected to destruction. Hearing this
Mahābali said: “Our Rākṣasas are more powerful
than that Viṣṇu.” Hearing these haughty words of
Bali, Prahlāda got angry and cursed Bali “Let your
country be destroyed.” Bali requested Prahlāda to
pardon him. Prahlāda advised Bali “You will get sal-
vation only by relying on Viṣṇu”. (Vāmana Purāṇa 77).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Defeated by Vāmana.%} The defeated devas had taken
refuge in forests. Aditi the mother of the devas was
very sorry at this. She shed tears before her husband
Kaśyapa Prajāpati, who advised his wife to take a fast
of twelve days, and taught her the rules and rituals of
the fast. Accordingly she took the fast, Viṣṇu appeared
before her and asked her what boon she wanted. She
requested Viṣṇu to take birth as her son, to drive away
Bali and to restore her sons, the devas (gods), to their
kingdom of heaven. Mahāviṣṇu agreed.
<div n="NI"/>Aditi became pregnant and gave birth to the son
Vāmana. He was an incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu. [The
5th incarnation (avatāra) of Viṣṇu].
<div n="NI"/>At this time Mahābali was performing a sacrifice on the
bank of the river Narmadā. Vāmana came to the place of
sacrifice in the dress of a hermit boy and told Mahābali
that he was a helpless hermit boy and requested that
he might be given three steps of ground. Mahābali
was pleased with the boy and told him that he was
willing to give the boy even the country called Bhṛṅgā-
raka and that he was prepared to forego the kingly
pleasures for the boy. The hermit boy did not show any
desire for them. So many gathered round them to
witness this sight. The teacher Śukrācārya called Mahā-
bali and said that the boy was a cheat and that his
request should not be granted. But Mahābali decided
to grant the wish of the boy and as a token of his gift
he began to offer the boy water from a waterpot. Then
the teacher got into the mouth of the pot in the shape
of a mote and water would not flow freely out of the
mouth of the pot. Knowing this Vāmana took a grass
of Darbha and pushed it at the mouth of the pot. The
grass pierced one eye of Śukrācārya. From that time
onwards Śukrācārya had only one eye. Water flowed
freely into the hands of Vāmana. Śukra got angry and
cursed Bali. Vāmana began to measure the ground
and simultaneously began to grow. The asuras who were
[Page104-b+ 65]
horrified at this, began to attack Vāmana with anything
they could lay hands on. Still Vāmana was growing.
Finally he became an immensely large being. With
one step he measured the whole of earth and with the
second step he took the whole of heaven. Then he
asked Bali, where to place the third step. Mahābali
said that he had only his body left, as his own, and
that Vāmana might take it and complete three steps.
Vāmana placed his foot on the head of Bali and pushed
him down to Pātāla (the Netherworld). Thencefor-
ward the asuras became the inhabitants of Pātāla.
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Bali and Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa visited Bali who
was under custody in Pātāla, and said to him, “I have
come to save you from here. So get yourself free from
the custody of Mahāviṣṇu, with my help.” Hearing
this, Bali asked Rāvaṇa to fetch the two earrings of
Hiraṇyakaśipu, which were shining like blazing fire
a little away from them. Rāvaṇa moved forward to
take them. But he fell unconscious. Bali caused him to
recover and said: “These earrings were worn by my
great grandfather Hiraṇyakaśipu. How could you,
who are not even capable of taking his earrings, save
me from his slayer, Viṣṇu? Viṣṇu is Almighty and
All-powerful and Supreme Lord of everything.” Hear-
ing this, Rāvaṇa was filled with shame and he returned.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa, Prakṣipta Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bali born as a Gardabha (Ass).%} Bali, who was fallen
from power took birth in the womb of an ass and
roamed about. Brahmā instructed Indra to find out
Bali. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapters 216-218).
