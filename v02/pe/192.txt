AMBĀLIKĀ¦. (1) The youngest of the three daughters
<div n="lb"/>of the King of Kāśī—Ambā, Ambikā and Ambālikā.
<div n="lb"/>Vicitravīrya, son of Śantanu married Ambikā and
<div n="lb"/>Ambālikā. The mother of this princess was Kausalyā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pāṇḍu's Mother.%} Vicitravīrya died before children
<div n="lb"/>were born to his wives. To avoid the extinction of the
<div n="lb"/>family, Satyavatī, mother of Vicitravīrya summoned
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa, her other son and asked him to beget a son for
<div n="lb"/>Ambikā. Vyāsa obeyed his mother half-heartedly.
<div n="lb"/>Ambikā did not like the dark-complexioned, crudely
<div n="lb"/>attired Vyāsa. Still owing to the Mother's pressure, she
<div n="lb"/>passively submitted to the act. As a result of their union
<div n="lb"/>was born Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who was blind from his birth. The
<div n="lb"/>grief-stricken mother called Vyāsa again and asked him
<div n="lb"/>to have union with Ambālikā this time. As Ambālikā's
<div n="lb"/>face was pale at the time of their union, a child with
<div n="lb"/>pale complexion was born to her. He was named Pāṇḍu.
<div n="lb"/>Having thus failed in both attempts, Satyavatī asked
<div n="lb"/>Ambikā to go to Vyāsa again. At night Ambikā secretly
<div n="lb"/>disguised her waiting-maid and sent her in her own
<div n="lb"/>place, to Vyāsa. The waiting-maid experienced exquisite
<div n="lb"/>pleasure in Vyāsa's company and as a result a most
<div n="lb"/>intelligent son was born to her. It was he who became
<div n="lb"/>the renowned Vidura. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 106).
