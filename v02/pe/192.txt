AMBĀLIKĀ¦. (1) The youngest of the three daughters
of the King of Kāśī—Ambā, Ambikā and Ambālikā.
Vicitravīrya, son of Śantanu married Ambikā and
Ambālikā. The mother of this princess was Kausalyā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pāṇḍu's Mother.%} Vicitravīrya died before children
were born to his wives. To avoid the extinction of the
family, Satyavatī, mother of Vicitravīrya summoned
Vyāsa, her other son and asked him to beget a son for
Ambikā. Vyāsa obeyed his mother half-heartedly.
Ambikā did not like the dark-complexioned, crudely
attired Vyāsa. Still owing to the Mother's pressure, she
passively submitted to the act. As a result of their union
was born Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who was blind from his birth. The
grief-stricken mother called Vyāsa again and asked him
to have union with Ambālikā this time. As Ambālikā's
face was pale at the time of their union, a child with
pale complexion was born to her. He was named Pāṇḍu.
Having thus failed in both attempts, Satyavatī asked
Ambikā to go to Vyāsa again. At night Ambikā secretly
disguised her waiting-maid and sent her in her own
place, to Vyāsa. The waiting-maid experienced exquisite
pleasure in Vyāsa's company and as a result a most
intelligent son was born to her. It was he who became
the renowned Vidura. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 106).
