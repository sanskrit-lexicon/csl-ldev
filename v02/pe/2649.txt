HAYAGRĪVA I¦. An Asura, the son of Kaśyapaprajāpati
by his wife Danu. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa,
Canto 14).
<div n="NI"/>As a child the Asura began tapas on the banks of river
Sarasvatī, and after a thousand years Devī appeared
and asked him to choose any boon he wanted, and he
wanted to become invincible by Devas and Asuras, and
also deathless. When Devī told him that such a boon
was out of question, he wanted the boon that he
(Hayagrīva) should not be killed by anyone but by a
Hayagrīva (one with the horse's neck). Devī granted him
the boon.
<div n="NI"/>Hayagrīva, who became haughty and overconfident on
receiving such a boon, went about the three worlds
troubling good people, and at last he clashed with the
Devas. As he could be killed only by one with the head
of a horse the combined attack of Mahāviṣṇu and the
Devas did not succeed in defeating him and Mahā-
viṣṇu decided to rest for some time to recoup himself
from weariness. During his rest his head was hit by
the end of his own bow and the head was severed from
the trunk. Mahāviṣṇu replaced the head thus lost with
that of a horse and killed Hayagrīva in fight. (For
details see Cital).
