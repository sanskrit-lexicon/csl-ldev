HAYAGRĪVA I¦. An Asura, the son of Kaśyapaprajāpati
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Danu. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Canto 14).
<div n="NI"/>As a child the Asura began tapas on the banks of river
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī, and after a thousand years Devī appeared
<div n="lb"/>and asked him to choose any boon he wanted, and he
<div n="lb"/>wanted to become invincible by Devas and Asuras, and
<div n="lb"/>also deathless. When Devī told him that such a boon
<div n="lb"/>was out of question, he wanted the boon that he
<div n="lb"/>(Hayagrīva) should not be killed by anyone but by a
<div n="lb"/>Hayagrīva (one with the horse's neck). Devī granted him
<div n="lb"/>the boon.
<div n="NI"/>Hayagrīva, who became haughty and overconfident on
<div n="lb"/>receiving such a boon, went about the three worlds
<div n="lb"/>troubling good people, and at last he clashed with the
<div n="lb"/>Devas. As he could be killed only by one with the head
<div n="lb"/>of a horse the combined attack of Mahāviṣṇu and the
<div n="lb"/>Devas did not succeed in defeating him and Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu decided to rest for some time to recoup himself
<div n="lb"/>from weariness. During his rest his head was hit by
<div n="lb"/>the end of his own bow and the head was severed from
<div n="lb"/>the trunk. Mahāviṣṇu replaced the head thus lost with
<div n="lb"/>that of a horse and killed Hayagrīva in fight. (For
<div n="lb"/>details see Cital).
