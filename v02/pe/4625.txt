MUÑJAVAṬA II¦. A holy place of pilgrimage devoted
to Śiva on the banks of the river Gaṅgā. If a man
goes to this place and does circumambulation of the
idol there singing songs in praise of Śiva he would get
the position of Gaṇapati and if he bathes in the Gaṅgā
river also, he would be absolved of all sins. (Śloka 67,
Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
