ĀSTĪKA¦. The son of the Maharṣi Jaratkāru and his wife,
<div n="lb"/>also named Jaratkāru. He stopped King Janamejaya's
<div n="lb"/>Sarpasatra and saved the nāgas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} There is a story about Āstīka's birth in the
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata. Long ago the people of the world were
<div n="lb"/>so much troubled by the serpents, that they sought pro-
<div n="lb"/>tection from Kaśyapa Prajāpati. To find a remedy for
<div n="lb"/>this, Kaśyapa discussed the matter with Brahmā. To
<div n="lb"/>put an end to the troubles from the serpents, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>suggested that a number of mantras and a deity as the
<div n="lb"/>basis of those mantras should be created. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa created many mantras and Manasā Devī as the
<div n="lb"/>basic deity of those mantras. She is named “Manasā-
<div n="lb"/>devī” because Kaśyapa created her by his mental
<div n="lb"/>power. Manasādevī has eleven other names also, name-
<div n="lb"/>ly Jaratkāru, Jagatgaurī, Siddhayoginī, Vaiṣṇavī, Nāga-
<div n="lb"/>bhaginī, Śaivī, Nāgeśvarī, Jaratkārupriyā, Āstīkamātā,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣaharā and Mahājñānayutā.
<div n="NI"/>Manasādevī (Jaratkāru) when quite young, went to
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa for doing tapas (penance). There she did tapas
<div n="lb"/>to Śiva for a thousand years. At last Śiva appeared and
<div n="lb"/>blessed her with divine wisdom. She returned with
<div n="lb"/>great learning and devotion. (Devī Bhāgavata, Navama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>At that time, a Muni (sage) named Jaratkāru, when
<div n="lb"/>travelling through the forest happened to see his pitṛs
<div n="lb"/>(souls of forefathers) hanging over a precipice at
<div n="lb"/>the end of a blade of grass. They were hanging preca-
<div n="lb"/>riously at the end of a reed grass, head downwards,
<div n="lb"/>about to fall into the abyss. Jaratkāru enquired why
<div n="lb"/>they were lying in that condition. They explained that
<div n="lb"/>they were in that plight because their descendant
<div n="lb"/>Jaratkāru had no children. As he is a bachelor there
<div n="lb"/>is no hope either, of his having any issue. Since he
<div n="lb"/>has no children, we will not get to heaven, they added.
<div n="lb"/>To save the Pitṛs from their predicament, Jaratkāru
<div n="lb"/>decided to marry. But he wished to marry a woman
<div n="lb"/>who had the same name as his. Once Vāsuki met
<div n="lb"/>Jaratkāru and told him that he had a sister named
<div n="lb"/>Jaratkāru and that he would be very happy if Jaratkāru
<div n="lb"/>married her. Jaratkāru accepted the offer readily and
<div n="lb"/>married Jaratkāru.
<div n="NI"/>After their marriage, while they were living together
<div n="lb"/>in a place called Puṣkara tīrtha, an unexpected event
<div n="lb"/>happened which interrupted the happy course of their
<div n="lb"/>life. One evening, the husband was sleeping with his
<div n="lb"/>head in the wife's lap, under a tree. The sun was about
<div n="lb"/>to set. As the Maharṣi did not wake up before sunset, the
<div n="lb"/>wife became anxious. It is believed that he who does not
<div n="lb"/>wake up before sunrise and he who does not offer pray-
<div n="lb"/>ers at dusk will be guilty of the sin of Brahmahatyā (kill-
<div n="lb"/>ing a Brahmin). Nor was it proper to wake him up from
<div n="lb"/>a sound sleep. But in the end, she did wake him up.
<div n="lb"/>The husband sprang up in great fury. He renounced
<div n="lb"/>the wife then and there. Weeping bitterly, she begged
<div n="lb"/>for his forgiveness. At last Jaratkāru relented and
<div n="lb"/>told her: “You will have a very noble, brilliant, re-
<div n="lb"/>nowned, virtuous, scholarly and devout son who will be
<div n="lb"/>a devotee of Viṣṇu and a preserver of the family”.
<div n="lb"/>After this Manasādevī set out to Kailāsa. When she
<div n="lb"/>reached there Parama-Śiva and Pārvatī comforted her.
<div n="NI"/>Manasādevī was pregnant. The precepts and spiritual
<div n="lb"/>advice given by Jaratkāru, Parama-Śiva and Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>were heard by the child in the womb and so even before
<div n="lb"/>his birth he became a Jñānī and a yogī. In due course
[Page094-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Manasādevī gave birth to a son who was a part of
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu). Since he was the son of Manasā-
<div n="lb"/>devī who had deep devotion to the Guru and to the
<div n="lb"/>Gods, the boy was named Āstīka.
<div n="NI"/>The Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, gives another reason for
<div n="lb"/>giving this name to the boy. When the sage Jaratkāru
<div n="lb"/>abandoned his wife, he had blessed her saying that the
<div n="lb"/>child in her womb would be a brilliant and devoted
<div n="lb"/>son. That is why this boy came to be called Āstīka.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Boyhood%} Āstīka was taught Veda, Vedāṃgas etc.
<div n="lb"/>by Parama-Śiva himself. After receiving the blessings
<div n="lb"/>of Parama-Śiva, Āstīka went to Puṣkara tīrtha and did
<div n="lb"/>tapas to Viṣṇu for many years. Having received Viṣṇu's
<div n="lb"/>blessings also, he returned to Kailāsa. After living there
<div n="lb"/>happily with his mother for some time, one day they
<div n="lb"/>started to the Āśrama of Kaśyapa Prajāpati, the
<div n="lb"/>father of Manasādevī. Kaśyapa was very much pleased
<div n="lb"/>to see his noble-hearted daughter and her brilliant
<div n="lb"/>son. To enhance the fame and accomplishments of
<div n="lb"/>the boy Kaśyapa gave a sumptuous feast to ten crores
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmins. (Devī Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Vāsuki was Manasādevī's brother. Āstīka grew up
<div n="lb"/>there under the care of Vāsuki. It was Cyavana Muni
<div n="lb"/>who taught Sāṃgavedas to Āstīka, at this time. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Āstīka at the Sarpasatra.%} Once King Parīkṣit, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Abhimanyu was travelling through the forest for
<div n="lb"/>hunting animals. He picked up a dead snake with the
<div n="lb"/>tip of his bow and put it on the shoulder of a sage
<div n="lb"/>named “Śamīka”. Śamīka's son, Śṛṃgī came to know
<div n="lb"/>of this. In his anger, Śṛṃgī pronounced a curse that
<div n="lb"/>King Parīkṣit should die within seven days by the bite
<div n="lb"/>of Takṣaka. When Parīkṣit heard of this, he had a
<div n="lb"/>palace built on a single pillar in the middle of the
<div n="lb"/>ocean, quite inaccessible to Takṣaka and took shelter
<div n="lb"/>there. The most famous physicians and wizards were
<div n="lb"/>engaged to ward off the approach of Takṣaka to that
<div n="lb"/>place. Six days passed like this. On the seventh day,
<div n="lb"/>determined to make a final attempt, Takṣaka disguised
<div n="lb"/>himself as an old Brāhmaṇa and set out to the King's
<div n="lb"/>place of shelter. On his way he met Dhanvantari who
<div n="lb"/>was proceeding to Parīkṣit to protect him. They be-
<div n="lb"/>came friends and as a result of it, Dhanvantari returned
<div n="lb"/>after receiving a large number of rare precious stones
<div n="lb"/>given to him by Takṣaka. Assuming the form of a small
<div n="lb"/>worm, Takṣaka secretly entered into a fruit which was
<div n="lb"/>to be presented to the King. As soon as the King took
<div n="lb"/>that fruit in his hand, Takṣaka took his own shape
<div n="lb"/>and size and bit the King who died immediately.
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya was the son of this King Parīkṣit.
<div n="NI"/>Janamejaya performed all the obsequies of his father.
<div n="lb"/>After that, in a spirit of revenge, with the object of
<div n="lb"/>annihilating the whole race of serpents, he summoned
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas to conduct a sarpa satra (snake sacrifice).
<div n="NI"/>In the sacrificial fire specially prepared at that yāga,
<div n="lb"/>many serpents were being burnt up. It seemed that the
<div n="lb"/>whole race of serpents would shortly be wiped out.
<div n="lb"/>But Takṣaka alone was not to be seen. The officiating
<div n="lb"/>priests were beginning to get angry. Impatient cries
<div n="lb"/>of Where is Takṣaka rent the air. The frightened
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka fled for life to the palace of his friend Indra
<div n="lb"/>and there lay down, curling round Indra's cot. When
<div n="lb"/>the priests understood this they decided to use their
<div n="lb"/>charms and mantras which would bring Indra, his bed,
<div n="lb"/>cot and all, along with Takṣaka to the sacrificial fire.
[Page095-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>At this stage, all the gods rushed to Manasādevī and
<div n="lb"/>fell at her feet and begged her to save the situation.
<div n="lb"/>The kindhearted Devī called her son Āstīka and advis-
<div n="lb"/>ed him to persuade Janamejaya to stop the sarpa-
<div n="lb"/>satra. Āstīka went to Janamejaya and requested him
<div n="lb"/>to give him the lives of Takṣaka and Indra as a gift.
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya, after consulting the munis and priests
<div n="lb"/>and at their advice, agreed to do so. In this way, the
<div n="lb"/>Sarpasatra was stopped and the remaining serpents
<div n="lb"/>escaped with their lives. (Devī Bhāgavata, Navama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, M.B., Ādi Parva).
