ŚATABALA¦. A peepal tree on the peak of mount
Kumuda. From the branches of the tree milk, butter-milk,
ghee, juice of Sugar-cane etc. descend carrying with
them divine rice, clothes, ornaments etc. to the Kumuda
mountain and flow in rivers towards the north. The
people in those places get their rice, clothes orna-
ments etc. from the river. Mīnākṣīdevī praised by
Devas has her abode here. Those who drink milk etc.
flowing in the river will not be affected by hunger,
thirst and signs of old age. Nor will any danger over-
take them. They will live long. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th
Skandha).
