BUDDHAGHOṢA¦. An ancient Sanskrit poet. It is be-
lieved that he lived in the 4th century A.D. The
most important work of this poet who was a Buddhist,
is ‘Padyacūḍāmaṇi’. The life of Buddha is described
in this Book in ten Kāṇḍas (sections). A similarity to
the poems of Kālidāsa and Aśvaghoṣa is seen in this
poem. Buddhaghoṣa is said to have reached Ceylon
in 357 A.D. and translated some Buddhist literature.
