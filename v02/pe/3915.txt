KUŚAPLAVA¦ (KUŚAPLAVANAM). A holy place. He
who bathes and spends three nights there will derive
[Page447-b+ 64]
the benefits of an aśvamedha yajña. (Bhīṣma Parva,
Chapter 12, Verse 21). It was here that Ditidevī, wife
of Kaśyapa did tapas for a son who would be equal to
Indra. Again it was here that Indra entered into the
womb of Diti and cut into pieces the child in the
womb. Kuśaplava became famous because of the above
happenings. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto
46).
