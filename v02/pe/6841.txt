SUBANDHU¦. An ācārya, who was the high priest of
King Asamāti. Once the King removed the priest
from his job and appointed two priests, Kirāta and
Ākuli in his stead, and after some time, the new pri-
ests, at the instance of the King, killed Subandhu.
But, three brothers of his joined together and brought
Subandhu back to life again by chanting hymns from
the Vedas. (Ṛgveda 10, 57. 60; Bṛhaddevatā. 7. 33).
