MALAYA V¦. In Mahābhārata there is a description
of another Malaya Mountain besides the Malaya moun-
tain of South India. When the sage Śuka ascended
Heaven, he saw a Malaya mountain on the way. The
celestial women, Urvaśī and Vipracitti used to dance
there daily. This Malaya is somewhere above Kailāsa.
(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 332, Verse 21).
