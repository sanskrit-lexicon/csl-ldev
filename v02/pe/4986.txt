PAÑCAVAṬĪ¦. The sacred place where Śrī Rāma built
<div n="lb"/>an āśrama and lived for some time with Sītā and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa during their exile in the forests. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story about Pañcavaṭī in the Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Pañcavaṭī is on the southern bank of the Godāvarī.
<div n="lb"/>Five Vaṭavṛkṣas (banyan trees) stand here in a circle
<div n="lb"/>and therefore, the place got the name Pañcavaṭī. There
<div n="lb"/>is a legend about these banyan trees. Once five Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharva youths encircled the sage Agastya in the forest
<div n="lb"/>as a sport and prevented him from moving towards any
<div n="lb"/>direction. The enraged sage cursed them to stand in
<div n="lb"/>the same position as banyan trees. Thus by obstructing
<div n="lb"/>the movements of a divine man they were forced to
<div n="lb"/>remain without movement as trees. Before they took
<div n="lb"/>the form of trees they begged the sage for deliverance
<div n="lb"/>from the curse. Agastya said, “One day Śri Rāma with
<div n="lb"/>his wife and brother will come and stay in an āśrama
<div n="lb"/>built in your midst. Their holy presence will give
<div n="lb"/>you salvation from my curse.”
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they came to that
<div n="lb"/>forest decided to build an āśrama in the centre of the
<div n="lb"/>circle formed by the five banyan trees. Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>started to build the hermitage. At first he cut down one
<div n="lb"/>of the trees standing tall and straight and to the
<div n="lb"/>surprise and astonishment of all the fallen trunk of the
<div n="lb"/>tree disappeared and there in its place lay the dead
[Page562-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>body of a demon youth. It was the body of Śambhu-
<div n="lb"/>kumāra, son of Śūrpaṇakhā. He was doing penance
<div n="lb"/>there when Śrī Rāma came there with Sītā and becom-
<div n="lb"/>ing lustful at the sight of Sītā he stood there as a tree.
<div n="lb"/>It was he who was cut down by Lakṣmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma understood the thing that happened. He
<div n="lb"/>then explained to Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa many things
<div n="lb"/>about the frauds and deceits of the demons. After that
<div n="lb"/>they built their hermitage there and dwelt there for a
<div n="lb"/>long time. (Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
