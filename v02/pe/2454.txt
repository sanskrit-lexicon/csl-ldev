GODILA II¦. A servant of Vaiśravaṇa. Once when
Godila was travelling by air he saw Padmāvatī, wife
[Page293-a+ 65]
of Ugrasena, King of Vidarbha, bathing in a pond
along with her companions. The very sight of the
enchanting Padmāvatī roused carnal passions in him
and the Yakṣa took the form of Ugrasena and started
singing from the top of a hillock nearby. Padmāvatī
went to him because she mistook him for her husband.
Embracing her passionately the Yakṣa outraged her
modesty. Subtle differences in the act created doubts
in Padmāvatī and, on being questioned, the Yakṣa told
the truth and left the place. (Chapter 49, Padma
Purāṇa).
