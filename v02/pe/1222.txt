BHŪTAS¦. (A set of beings created by Rudra).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Mānava class or sect in ancient India.
In the Purāṇas, this Mānava sect is classified into four
subdivisions. (1) Dharmapraja (2) Īśvarapraja (3)
Kāśyapīyapraja (4) Pulahapraja.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} In the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa there is the follow-
ing story about the birth and shape of Bhūtas:—
<div n="NI"/>Bhūtas are one of the subdivisions of Pulaha's creations.
Long ago, Brahmā asked the Rudra, Nīlalohita, to
perform the function of creation. Accordingly he begot
thousands of Bhūtas in the womb of his wife Satī. All
the issues were the exact replica of his own figure.
Lean limbs, long ears, thick hanging lips, red eyes, bushy
eyebrows, long, pointed and protruding teeth, long nails,
matted dirty hair etc. were the grotesque features of
these Bhūtas. These music-haters used serpents as their
Yajñopavītas (sacred threads). These spirits who loitered
in Śiva's assembly were, as a rule, naked and carried
skulls on their heads. But at times they wore fantastic
dress with elephant skin. Their chief weapons were,
trident, bow, sword, etc.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhūta Chief.%} In the Purāṇas, Rudra is acknowledged
as the Bhūta chief. That is why Rudra is known by such
names as “Bhūtanāyaka”, “Gaṇanāyaka”, “Rudrānu-
cara”, “Bhavapariṣada” etc. But since the common
name Rudra is used for the ruler (king) of all the
Bhūtas, Vāmana Purāṇa declares that Rudra is not an
individual. Both Vāmanapurāṇa and Matsyapurāṇa
represent Vīrabhadra and Nandikeśvara as two Rudras
who are the masters of Bhūtas. (Matsyapurāṇa 181,
2; Vāmanapurāṇa 4, 17).
<div n="NI"/>In Vāmana Purāṇa, the number of Bhūtas is given as
11 crores. Śkanda, Sākha, Bhairava are the chief among
them. Under them are innumerable Bhūtas. Ashes
[Page145-b+ 65]
and Khatvāṃga etc. are their weapons. The emblem
on the banner is a cow or a bird. That is how the
Gaṇanāyakas have got the titles like “Mayūradhvaja”,
“Mayūravāhana”. (Vāmana Purāṇa 67, 1-23).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%War with Asuras.%} In the war between Śiva and
Andhakāsura, the Bhūtas fought on the side of Śiva.
It was Vināyaka, the master of the Bhūta hordes who
first came into conflict with the Asura. In that battle
Andhaka defeated Vināyaka. After that, Nandi, an-
other leader of the Bhūtas, attacked Andhaka jointly
with Vināyaka and defeated him. At last, Andhaka
approached Śiva himself for protection, and Śiva received
him and appointed him as commander of one of his
hordes of Bhūtas. It is this Andhakāsura who later
became famous under the name of Bhṛṅgi.
<div n="NI"/>In this way, the Bhūtas had fought many battles with
the Asuras, joining the party of the Devas. But at the
time of Dakṣa's yajña, they joined the party of the Asuras
and opposed the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>Although the Bhūtas won all the battles they fought both
on the side of the Devas and on the side of the Asuras,
in the end they had to leave north India and to come and
settle down in south India. By the time of Vaivasvata
manvantara they had already become South Indians.
