BHŪTAS¦. (A set of beings created by Rudra).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A Mānava class or sect in ancient India.
<div n="lb"/>In the Purāṇas, this Mānava sect is classified into four
<div n="lb"/>subdivisions. (1) Dharmapraja (2) Īśvarapraja (3)
<div n="lb"/>Kāśyapīyapraja (4) Pulahapraja.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} In the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa there is the follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing story about the birth and shape of Bhūtas:—
<div n="NI"/>Bhūtas are one of the subdivisions of Pulaha's creations.
<div n="lb"/>Long ago, Brahmā asked the Rudra, Nīlalohita, to
<div n="lb"/>perform the function of creation. Accordingly he begot
<div n="lb"/>thousands of Bhūtas in the womb of his wife Satī. All
<div n="lb"/>the issues were the exact replica of his own figure.
<div n="lb"/>Lean limbs, long ears, thick hanging lips, red eyes, bushy
<div n="lb"/>eyebrows, long, pointed and protruding teeth, long nails,
<div n="lb"/>matted dirty hair etc. were the grotesque features of
<div n="lb"/>these Bhūtas. These music-haters used serpents as their
<div n="lb"/>Yajñopavītas (sacred threads). These spirits who loitered
<div n="lb"/>in Śiva's assembly were, as a rule, naked and carried
<div n="lb"/>skulls on their heads. But at times they wore fantastic
<div n="lb"/>dress with elephant skin. Their chief weapons were,
<div n="lb"/>trident, bow, sword, etc.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhūta Chief.%} In the Purāṇas, Rudra is acknowledged
<div n="lb"/>as the Bhūta chief. That is why Rudra is known by such
<div n="lb"/>names as “Bhūtanāyaka”, “Gaṇanāyaka”, “Rudrānu-
<div n="lb"/>cara”, “Bhavapariṣada” etc. But since the common
<div n="lb"/>name Rudra is used for the ruler (king) of all the
<div n="lb"/>Bhūtas, Vāmana Purāṇa declares that Rudra is not an
<div n="lb"/>individual. Both Vāmanapurāṇa and Matsyapurāṇa
<div n="lb"/>represent Vīrabhadra and Nandikeśvara as two Rudras
<div n="lb"/>who are the masters of Bhūtas. (Matsyapurāṇa 181,
<div n="lb"/>2; Vāmanapurāṇa 4, 17).
<div n="NI"/>In Vāmana Purāṇa, the number of Bhūtas is given as
<div n="lb"/>11 crores. Śkanda, Sākha, Bhairava are the chief among
<div n="lb"/>them. Under them are innumerable Bhūtas. Ashes
[Page145-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and Khatvāṃga etc. are their weapons. The emblem
<div n="lb"/>on the banner is a cow or a bird. That is how the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇanāyakas have got the titles like “Mayūradhvaja”,
<div n="lb"/>“Mayūravāhana”. (Vāmana Purāṇa 67, 1-23).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%War with Asuras.%} In the war between Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Andhakāsura, the Bhūtas fought on the side of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>It was Vināyaka, the master of the Bhūta hordes who
<div n="lb"/>first came into conflict with the Asura. In that battle
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka defeated Vināyaka. After that, Nandi, an-
<div n="lb"/>other leader of the Bhūtas, attacked Andhaka jointly
<div n="lb"/>with Vināyaka and defeated him. At last, Andhaka
<div n="lb"/>approached Śiva himself for protection, and Śiva received
<div n="lb"/>him and appointed him as commander of one of his
<div n="lb"/>hordes of Bhūtas. It is this Andhakāsura who later
<div n="lb"/>became famous under the name of Bhṛṅgi.
<div n="NI"/>In this way, the Bhūtas had fought many battles with
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras, joining the party of the Devas. But at the
<div n="lb"/>time of Dakṣa's yajña, they joined the party of the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>and opposed the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>Although the Bhūtas won all the battles they fought both
<div n="lb"/>on the side of the Devas and on the side of the Asuras,
<div n="lb"/>in the end they had to leave north India and to come and
<div n="lb"/>settle down in south India. By the time of Vaivasvata
<div n="lb"/>manvantara they had already become South Indians.
