MAHĪRATHA¦. A King who earned great merit by
<div n="lb"/>observing Vrata in the month of Vaiśākha (May).
<div n="lb"/>This King gave to those in hell his one day's puṇya
<div n="lb"/>and all of them were released from hell.
[Page465-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Mahīratha was a King who became prosperous by
<div n="lb"/>accrued puṇya. Kaśyapa was his guru. The King
<div n="lb"/>entrusted the affairs of the state to his ministers and
<div n="lb"/>led a very immoral life. The country began to decay
<div n="lb"/>day by day and one day Kaśyapa gave Dharmopadeśa
<div n="lb"/>to Mahīratha. The Guru said: “Oh King, your body
<div n="lb"/>which was in a state of sinning has attained a state of
<div n="lb"/>virtue by your association with me. Those well-versed
<div n="lb"/>in the Vedas say that the body is of three different
<div n="lb"/>kinds. Firstly there is the one which is evil-natured
<div n="lb"/>without either virtue or knowledge. Secondly, there is
<div n="lb"/>the virtuous one with good conduct. Thirdly, there is
<div n="lb"/>the agonising body which hides both virtue and evil.
<div n="lb"/>The body without virtue and salvation is always a
<div n="lb"/>body of sins. Your body has now become virtuous
<div n="lb"/>by becoming devotional to your guru and attending to
<div n="lb"/>my words. You are now fit to do virtuous deeds and I
<div n="lb"/>shall now make you enjoy the benefits of Vaiśākhasnāna
<div n="lb"/>(a bath with religious rites in the month of Vaiśākha
<div n="lb"/>(May).
<div n="NI"/>After that Kaśyapa made him take the bath and worship
<div n="lb"/>with proper Vedic rites in the month of Vaiśākha. The
<div n="lb"/>King became old and died. At once the servants of
<div n="lb"/>Kāla (King of Death) came to fetch the soul of
<div n="lb"/>Mahīratha. But angels from Mahāviṣṇu came and
<div n="lb"/>thrusting aside the agents of Kāla took charge of the
<div n="lb"/>soul of Mahīratha. Nymphs from above sang in praise
<div n="lb"/>of the King whose sin had waned because of Vaiśā-
<div n="lb"/>khaprātassnāna (early morning bath in the month of
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśākha). The angels from Viṣṇu carrying the soul
<div n="lb"/>of the King to Svarga took him through hell. The King
<div n="lb"/>heard the agonising cries of those suffering from
<div n="lb"/>different kinds of torture in hell. The King made
<div n="lb"/>enquiries and feeling compassionate requested those in
<div n="lb"/>charge of the hell to release those there in hell then
<div n="lb"/>by accepting a portion of the puṇya acquired by him.
<div n="lb"/>The angels agreed to that and the King gave away the
<div n="lb"/>Puṇya he had acquired during one day by observing
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśākhavrata. At once all those in hell were
<div n="lb"/>released from the agony and were sent to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(Vaiśākhamāhātmyaprakaraṇa, Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla-
<div n="lb"/>khaṇḍa).
