ŚRUTAŚRAVAS III¦. A Maharṣi. He had a son named
<div n="lb"/>Somaśravas. There is the following story in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, about the way in which
<div n="lb"/>these two sages came to be associated with King
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya.
<div n="NI"/>Janamejaya, son of Parīkṣit, along with his brothers per-
<div n="lb"/>formed an elaborate Yāga at Kurukṣetra. His three
<div n="lb"/>brothers were Śrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena.
<div n="lb"/>While they were performing the Yāga, a dog which was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Saramā came there. Janamejaya's brothers
<div n="lb"/>attacked the dog without any provocation. Saramā be-
<div n="lb"/>came angry and she cursed Janamejaya. The curse
<div n="lb"/>frightened him. After the Yāga he reached Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>and went out in search of a priest who would be able
<div n="lb"/>to liberate him from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>Once, as he was returning from a hunt, he happened to
<div n="lb"/>come across an āśrama within his country. A sage
<div n="lb"/>named Śrutaśravas lived there. He had a son named
<div n="lb"/>Somaśravas. Janamejaya invited Somaśravas to be his
<div n="lb"/>priest. At that time Śrutaśravas said to him:- “This my
<div n="lb"/>son was born to a serpent-woman and he is endowed
<div n="lb"/>with the power of my austerity. He is capable of releas-
<div n="lb"/>ing you from all sins except “Mahādevakṛtyā”. If a
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa prays to him for anything, the prayer would
<div n="lb"/>be fulfilled. If you can set it right, you may take him
<div n="lb"/>with you.”
<div n="NI"/>Janamejaya agreed and took Śomaśravas with him to
<div n="lb"/>the palace. He made him priest and completed the
<div n="lb"/>Yāga. Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 58 states that
<div n="lb"/>Śrutaśravas was also a member of Janamejaya's Yāga.
[Page742-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>He was among the sages who attained Siddhi (super-
<div n="lb"/>human powers) by performing tapas. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 292, Verse 16).
