ŚRUTAŚRAVAS III¦. A Maharṣi. He had a son named
Somaśravas. There is the following story in Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, about the way in which
these two sages came to be associated with King
Janamejaya.
<div n="NI"/>Janamejaya, son of Parīkṣit, along with his brothers per-
formed an elaborate Yāga at Kurukṣetra. His three
brothers were Śrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena.
While they were performing the Yāga, a dog which was
the son of Saramā came there. Janamejaya's brothers
attacked the dog without any provocation. Saramā be-
came angry and she cursed Janamejaya. The curse
frightened him. After the Yāga he reached Hastināpura
and went out in search of a priest who would be able
to liberate him from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>Once, as he was returning from a hunt, he happened to
come across an āśrama within his country. A sage
named Śrutaśravas lived there. He had a son named
Somaśravas. Janamejaya invited Somaśravas to be his
priest. At that time Śrutaśravas said to him:- “This my
son was born to a serpent-woman and he is endowed
with the power of my austerity. He is capable of releas-
ing you from all sins except “Mahādevakṛtyā”. If a
Brāhmaṇa prays to him for anything, the prayer would
be fulfilled. If you can set it right, you may take him
with you.”
<div n="NI"/>Janamejaya agreed and took Śomaśravas with him to
the palace. He made him priest and completed the
Yāga. Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 58 states that
Śrutaśravas was also a member of Janamejaya's Yāga.

He was among the sages who attained Siddhi (super-
human powers) by performing tapas. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 292, Verse 16).
