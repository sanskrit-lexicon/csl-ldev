BHADRAŚĀLA¦(M). A forest on the top of the Moun-
tain Bhadrāśvavarṣa which lies to the east of
Mahāmeru. There is a tree called Kālāmra in this
forest. This is a very sacred tree standing miles
high above other trees and is being worshipped by
the Vṛddhacāraṇas. By worshipping this tree the
men have become white and majestic and by drink-
ing a juice prepared from its leaves the women keep
themselves eternally young. Chapter seven of Bhīṣma
Parva says like this about this tree: “Kālāmra stands
towering miles high bearing flowers and fruits at all
times of the year. The Vṛddhacāraṇas worshipping it
are white, strong and majestic. The women drinking
its juice are lotus-complexioned, beautiful, Moonfaced,
[Page110-b+ 65]
well versed in music and dance and having a life-span of
over a thousand years, remaining young all the time.”
