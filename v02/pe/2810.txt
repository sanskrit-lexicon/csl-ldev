JAGANNĀTHA¦ PAṆḌITA. A very powerful and ruthless
<div n="lb"/>literary critic in Sanskrit. He lived between 1590 and
<div n="lb"/>1665. He is also known as Paṇḍitarāja (King of scho-
<div n="lb"/>lars). His most important and well-known work is
<div n="lb"/>Rasagaṅgādhara. To this day it remains as an invalu-
<div n="lb"/>able treasure in rhetorics. (Alaṅkāra Śāstra).
<div n="NI"/>His poetic theory is “Ramaṇīyārthapratipādakaḥ Śabdaḥ
<div n="lb"/>Kāvyam”. (Words which convey beautiful meanings
<div n="lb"/>constitute poetry). He vehemently opposed the dhvani
<div n="lb"/>vāda (suggestive words and phrases conveying more
<div n="lb"/>meanings produce more rasa than they literally
<div n="lb"/>and apparently appear to carry). Citramīmāṃsā-
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍana is another work of the Paṇḍitarāja. In
<div n="lb"/>this work another rhetorician named Appayadīkṣita is
<div n="lb"/>strongly criticised. The allegoric poem, “Bhāminīvilā-
<div n="lb"/>sam”, is supposed to have been written by this great
<div n="lb"/>rhetorician based on the untimely death of his wife,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāminī. He has also written five other works, the five
<div n="lb"/>Laharīs [Gaṅgālaharī etc].
