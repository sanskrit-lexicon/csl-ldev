ALAṄKĀRAVATĪ¦. Wife of King Naravāhanadatta. It
<div n="lb"/>is seen in the Kathāsaritsāgara where a Vidyādhara
<div n="lb"/>woman tells the story of Alaṅkāravatī to the King.
<div n="NI"/>Once a vidyādhara named Alaṅkāraśīla ruled over a
<div n="lb"/>city called Śrī Sundarapura in the Himālayas. His wife
<div n="lb"/>was called Kāñcanaprabhā. A son was born to them.
<div n="lb"/>They named him Dharmaśīla because Devī Kātyāyanī
<div n="lb"/>told them in a dream that the son would become Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>para (who performs duties well). To the prince, know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge in every branch of studies was imparted and then
<div n="lb"/>he was anointed heir to the throne. He executed regal
<div n="lb"/>functions to perfection and ruled his subjects better than
<div n="lb"/>his father. Kāñcanaprabhā, wife of Alaṅkāraśīla, gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a daughter. At the time of her birth a heavenly
<div n="lb"/>voice said that she would become the wife of Naravā-
<div n="lb"/>hanadatta the emperor of the Vidyādharas. They named
<div n="lb"/>her Alaṅkāravatī. She grew into a very beautiful maiden.
<div n="lb"/>She learned arts and sciences from her father. She went
<div n="lb"/>on a pilgrimage to the Śiva temples far and wide. One
<div n="lb"/>day she heard a celestial voice: “Go to the Svayambhu
<div n="lb"/>temple in Kaśmīra and worship there and you will get
<div n="lb"/>as your husband Naravāhanadatta.” Finally Nara-
<div n="lb"/>vāhanadatta the emperor of Vidyādharas married her.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara, Lambaka 9, Taraṅga 1).
