ALAṄKĀRAVATĪ¦. Wife of King Naravāhanadatta. It
is seen in the Kathāsaritsāgara where a Vidyādhara
woman tells the story of Alaṅkāravatī to the King.
<div n="NI"/>Once a vidyādhara named Alaṅkāraśīla ruled over a
city called Śrī Sundarapura in the Himālayas. His wife
was called Kāñcanaprabhā. A son was born to them.
They named him Dharmaśīla because Devī Kātyāyanī
told them in a dream that the son would become Dharma-
para (who performs duties well). To the prince, know-
ledge in every branch of studies was imparted and then
he was anointed heir to the throne. He executed regal
functions to perfection and ruled his subjects better than
his father. Kāñcanaprabhā, wife of Alaṅkāraśīla, gave
birth to a daughter. At the time of her birth a heavenly
voice said that she would become the wife of Naravā-
hanadatta the emperor of the Vidyādharas. They named
her Alaṅkāravatī. She grew into a very beautiful maiden.
She learned arts and sciences from her father. She went
on a pilgrimage to the Śiva temples far and wide. One
day she heard a celestial voice: “Go to the Svayambhu
temple in Kaśmīra and worship there and you will get
as your husband Naravāhanadatta.” Finally Nara-
vāhanadatta the emperor of Vidyādharas married her.
