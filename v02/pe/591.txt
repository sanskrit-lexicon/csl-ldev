AŚVINĪKUMĀRA¦(S) (AŚVINĪDEVAS). Satya and
<div n="lb"/>Dasra, the two sons of Sūrya (The Sun) are called
<div n="lb"/>Aśvianīkumāras. (Ślokas 17 and 18, Chapter 150, Anu-
<div n="lb"/>śāsana Parva, M.B.). They are also known as Aśvins,
[Page069-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and Aśvinīdevas. These two are the physicians
<div n="lb"/>of the devas. (Śloka 12, Chapter 123, Araṇya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending from Viṣṇu in order are:
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Marīci, Kaśyapa, Vivasvān (the Sun),
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīkumāras.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} The Viṣṇu Purāṇa describes the birth thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśvakarmā, was the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya. She got three children: Manu, Yama and Yamī.
<div n="lb"/>Once finding the effulgence of Sūrya unbearable she
<div n="lb"/>engaged Chāyā to look after Sūrya and left for the
<div n="lb"/>forests to do penance there. Sūrya took Chāyā to be
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā and got three children of her: Śanaiścara,
<div n="lb"/>(another) Manu and Tapatī. Once Chāyā got angry
<div n="lb"/>and cursed Yama. It was then that Sūrya and Yama
<div n="lb"/>came to know that she was not Saṃjñā, getting more
<div n="lb"/>details from Chāyā, Sūrya found out by his Jñānadṛṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>(a power of sight developed by Yoga by which one
<div n="lb"/>could see things far beyond the limits of his vision)
<div n="lb"/>that Saṃjñā was practising austerities taking the form of
<div n="lb"/>a mare. Then Sūrya went to her disguised as a horse
<div n="lb"/>and with her co-operation produced three children of
<div n="lb"/>which the first two became known as Aśvinīkumāras. The
<div n="lb"/>third son was called Revanta. Then Sūrya took Saṃjñā
<div n="lb"/>to his place (Chapter 2, Aṃśa 3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="lb"/>Śloka 35 of Chapter 66 of Ādi Parva states that Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>kumāras were born from the nose of Saṃjñā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Aśvinīkumāras tested Sukanyā.%} The Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata contains a story of how the Aśvinīkumāras tested
<div n="lb"/>the fidelity of Sukanyā, daughter of Śaryāti and made
<div n="lb"/>her old and senile husband into a young and virile one.
<div n="lb"/>Śaryāti, son of Vaivasvata manu, had four thousand
<div n="lb"/>beautiful princesses as wives. But none had any child-
<div n="lb"/>ren. When they were lamenting over this misfortune
<div n="lb"/>one of the wives gave birth to a girl and she was called
<div n="lb"/>Sukanyā. The father and all his wives together brought
<div n="lb"/>up this daughter with great affection.
<div n="NI"/>In the neighbourhood of the palace of Śaryāti there was
<div n="lb"/>a tapovana as good and grand as Nandanavana and it
<div n="lb"/>contained a lake similar to the Mānasa lake. In one
<div n="lb"/>corner of this tapovana a sage named Cyavana was
<div n="lb"/>doing penance. He had been sitting there for so long a
<div n="lb"/>period without food meditating on a goddess that he was
<div n="lb"/>covered with plants and shrubs had grown over him. He
<div n="lb"/>was unaware of the growth around him. Once at this
<div n="lb"/>time Śaryāti with his wives and child and followed by a
<div n="lb"/>large retinue entered the tapovana for recreation. The
<div n="lb"/>King and his wives entered the lake and Sukanyā with
<div n="lb"/>her friends moved about in the garden plucking flowers
<div n="lb"/>and playing. Moving about thus aimlessly Sukanyā and
<div n="lb"/>party reached the place where Cyavana was doing
<div n="lb"/>penance. She saw the huge shrubby growth and while
<div n="lb"/>looking at it saw two gleaming points inside the shrubby
<div n="lb"/>heap. She was about to break open the thing when from
<div n="lb"/>inside she heard somebody addressing her thus: “Oh,
<div n="lb"/>innocent girl, why do you think of doing this mischief.
<div n="lb"/>Please do go your way. I am an ascetic. What wrong
<div n="lb"/>have I done to you for you to disturb me like this?” But
<div n="lb"/>Sukanyā brought up as she was, as a very pet girl did
<div n="lb"/>not like anybody advising her like this and so taking a
<div n="lb"/>pointed stick gave two pricks at the site of the gleam-
<div n="lb"/>points and left the place arrogantly.
<div n="NI"/>The gleam-points were the eyes of Cyavana and so he
<div n="lb"/>lost his eyes and suffered much from the pain. Though
<div n="lb"/>he felt angry he did not curse anybody. But slowly the
[Page070-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>country began to witness the evil effects of this cruel
<div n="lb"/>deed. People stopped passing urine or faeces. Even
<div n="lb"/>animals were affected. The King and his ministers were
<div n="lb"/>worried. People came on deputation to the King to
<div n="lb"/>describe the disaster that had gripped the state. The
<div n="lb"/>King began to doubt that somebody must have done some
<div n="lb"/>great injury to the sage, Cyavana. He started enquiries
<div n="lb"/>asking his subjects one by one about this. But everybody
<div n="lb"/>replied in the negative. He bribed, he threatened. The
<div n="lb"/>result was the same. Then one day while the King and
<div n="lb"/>his courtiers were sitting despondent Sukanyā approach-
<div n="lb"/>ed her father and confessed what she had done. She
<div n="lb"/>said: “While I was playing with my friends in the
<div n="lb"/>tapovana I saw this huge shrub-heap and two points
<div n="lb"/>gleaming from inside. I took a pin-stick and pricked
<div n="lb"/>them both and on drawing it out I found it wet also.
<div n="lb"/>But I left the matter there and never made any
<div n="lb"/>enquiries thereafter”. Śaryāti now knew the cause of this
<div n="lb"/>national disaster and so immediately rushed to the sage
<div n="lb"/>for forgiveness. Prostrating before the ṛṣi the King pleaded
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, best of ṛṣis, forgive us for this injury done unknow-
<div n="lb"/>ingly. My daughter who is only an innocent child did
<div n="lb"/>this playfully while she was playing in this garden with
<div n="lb"/>her friends. She never knew what she pricked for a fun
<div n="lb"/>were your eyes. Oh, the best of sage, thou art rich in
<div n="lb"/>forgiveness and so please do condone this mischief and
<div n="lb"/>bless us.” Cyavana replied that he would forgive if he
<div n="lb"/>gave Sukanyā in marriage to him. Śaryāti was depressed.
<div n="lb"/>How could he give his only and beautiful daughter to
<div n="lb"/>this aged senile ugly and blind ṛṣi? While the King was
<div n="lb"/>thus pondering over this, Sukanyā herself came to him
<div n="lb"/>and said, “Oh, dear father, please do not worry on
<div n="lb"/>my account. I shall go as his wife. If he is satisfied
<div n="lb"/>the nation would be saved from a calamity and I am
<div n="lb"/>prepared to sacrifice my happiness for the sake of the
<div n="lb"/>country. I will be only too glad to do so.” With suppress-
<div n="lb"/>ed unwillingness the King gave his daughter in marri-
<div n="lb"/>age to Cyavana.
<div n="NI"/>Sukanyā after her marriage engaged herself fully in the
<div n="lb"/>service of looking after the welfare of her husband. She
<div n="lb"/>gave her husband healthy and tasty fruits and vegeta-
<div n="lb"/>bles, bathed him daily in hot water, placed before him
<div n="lb"/>all the materials for his pūjā and when the time came
<div n="lb"/>for his meals gave him his food sitting by his side. After
<div n="lb"/>the meals she gave him tāmbūla and only after putting
<div n="lb"/>him on a bed would she go to attend to her own affairs.
<div n="lb"/>After finishing her meals she would come again to her
<div n="lb"/>husband and sit by his side massaging him. In the even-
<div n="lb"/>ing she would make ready all the things required for the
<div n="lb"/>pūjā and after the pūjā feed him with nourishing food.
<div n="lb"/>Whatever remained after his feed would be taken by her.
<div n="lb"/>At night she would be at the foot of her husband and
<div n="lb"/>take a nap. In the morning she would attend to all the
<div n="lb"/>details of the ablutions of her husband. Thus Sukanyā
<div n="lb"/>lived true to her husband always anxious to please him.
<div n="lb"/>Then one day the Aśvinīkumāras saw her going to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama after her bath. They were very much attracted
<div n="lb"/>by the stunning beauty of the maiden that they approach-
<div n="lb"/>ed her and asked: “Oh, beautiful maiden, who are you?
<div n="lb"/>We are Aśvinīkumāras. You seem to be alone. How did
<div n="lb"/>you happen to come to this place? You are one who
<div n="lb"/>should always move about with friends and courtiers
<div n="lb"/>and what is the reason for your living like this?”
<div n="lb"/>Sukanyā replied, “Revered Devas, I am the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Śaryāti and wife of Cyavana. Forced by certain circum-
[Page070-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>stances my father gave me in marriage to this sage who
<div n="lb"/>is very old and blind. He is living in the āśrama nearby.
<div n="lb"/>I am living with him looking after his comfort. If you
<div n="lb"/>think it convenient you can come and accept our
<div n="lb"/>hospitality.” Hearing this the Aśvinīkumāras told her
<div n="lb"/>thus: “Sweet girl, you are fit to be the wife of one who
<div n="lb"/>is better than this blind old ascetic. So please do accept
<div n="lb"/>one of us as your husband”. Sukanyā did not relish
<div n="lb"/>this talk and threatening them that if they did not with-
<div n="lb"/>draw stopping such blabbering she would curse them
<div n="lb"/>to ashes. The Aśvinīdevas were a bit surprised and also
<div n="lb"/>frightened at the attitude of Sukanyā. “Oh, Princess,
<div n="lb"/>we are immensely pleased at your sense of righteousness
<div n="lb"/>and chastity and you can ask of us a boon. We are
<div n="lb"/>physicians of the devas and can give your husband his
<div n="lb"/>sight and can also make him young and virile. But there
<div n="lb"/>is a condition for this. As soon as your husband be-
<div n="lb"/>comes young and handsome we will also become like
<div n="lb"/>him and then you can select one among us. Are you
<div n="lb"/>willing? If so we will make your husband charming and
<div n="lb"/>handsome at this instant.
<div n="NI"/>Sukanyā was well pleased with this offer but the condi-
<div n="lb"/>tion placed did not satisfy her. So she ran to the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>and told her husband thus: “Lord, I met the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas on my way from the river after my bath and
<div n="lb"/>enamoured of my beauty they have made this offer. We
<div n="lb"/>will make your husband young and beautiful giving him
<div n="lb"/>back his eyesight and then we will change ourselves to
<div n="lb"/>resemble him. You have then to select one of us as your
<div n="lb"/>husband. I am not able to understand their cunning and
<div n="lb"/>so I have come to you to get from you the answer for
<div n="lb"/>their question. I am anxious to see you young and hand-
<div n="lb"/>some with your eyesight regained. I shall do as you
<div n="lb"/>direct.”
<div n="NI"/>Cyavana said: “There is nothing in this for great think-
<div n="lb"/>ing. You go and tell them that you would do as they
<div n="lb"/>wish and bring them down here. On hearing this Sukanyā
<div n="lb"/>went to the Aśvinīkumāras and took them to the āśrama.
<div n="lb"/>They asked Cyavana to take a dip in the lake nearby
<div n="lb"/>and as he entered the lake the Aśvinīdevas also entered
<div n="lb"/>it and took a dip in its waters along with Cyavana. Lo!
<div n="lb"/>As they rose from the waters all the three became young
<div n="lb"/>and handsome looking alike. The Aśvinīdevas then
<div n="lb"/>requested Sukanyā to select one among them. Sukanyā
<div n="lb"/>was in a fix and she prayed to her goddess to give her
<div n="lb"/>power to identify her husband. She was blessed with
<div n="lb"/>that power and she selected Cyavana from the lot at
<div n="lb"/>which the Aśvinīdevas were also pleased. (Seventh
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Cyavana's gratitude.%} Cyavana who got back his eye-
<div n="lb"/>sight and youth asked the Aśvinīkumāras what boon
<div n="lb"/>they wanted. They then told him thus: “We are the
<div n="lb"/>physicians of the devas. Devendra has unnecessarily put
<div n="lb"/>a ban on our drinking Soma (juice extracted from the
<div n="lb"/>creeper Soma). When Brahmā performed a yāga at
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru this leader of the devas did not allow us to
<div n="lb"/>take a soma drink. If you are capable of doing it you
<div n="lb"/>should get us the right to take this celestial drink.”
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana promised to do that.
<div n="NI"/>Before long, King Śaryāti and his wife came to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama to enquire about the welfare of their daughter.
<div n="lb"/>To their great amazement they found a young and hand-
<div n="lb"/>some ascetic at the āśrama and were a bit suspicious of
<div n="lb"/>the character of their daughter. But soon all doubts were
<div n="lb"/>cleared and they were immensely pleased. Cyavana then
[Page071-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>told the King the request of the Aśvinīdevas and Śaryāti
<div n="lb"/>also promised his help on this matter.
<div n="NI"/>On their return to their palace Śaryāti decided to per-
<div n="lb"/>form a big yāga to which all the devas were also invited.
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana officiated as priest. The Aśvinīdevas were also
<div n="lb"/>present quite to the dislike of Indra. The time came for
<div n="lb"/>distributing soma, and when Cyavana called the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>kumāras to take their share Indra objected saying that
<div n="lb"/>since they were physicians of the devas they could not
<div n="lb"/>be given that drink. Cyavana argued against that and
<div n="lb"/>after a great verbal combat Cyavana succeeded in
<div n="lb"/>making the Aśvinīkumāras take the drink. For more
<div n="lb"/>details look under ‘Cyavana’. (Seventh Skandha, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other information regarding Aśvinīkumāras.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) How they tested Upamanyu. This story is given
<div n="lb"/>under the word Āpodadhaumya.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Birth of Nakula and Sahadeva. Kuntī, wife of Pāṇḍu,
<div n="lb"/>had obtained from Sage Durvāsas five sacred mantras,
<div n="lb"/>the chanting of each of which would give her a child.
<div n="NI"/>Even before her marriage Kuntī tested the power of the
<div n="lb"/>mantras by chanting one of them. Sūrya appeared and
<div n="lb"/>she had to take a son from him who became the famous
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa later. By chanting the second, third and fourth
<div n="lb"/>meditating on Yama, Vāyu and Indra, Kuntī got
<div n="lb"/>respectively the sons Dharmaputra, Bhīma and Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>The fifth mantra she gave to Mādrī and she meditated
<div n="lb"/>on the Aśvinīdevas and got Nakula and Sahadeva.
<div n="NI"/>(3) The Aśvinīdevas were present for the marriage of
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī. (Śloka 6, Chapter 186, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="lb"/>During the burning of the forest Khāṇḍava the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas stood on the side of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>(4) King Yuvanāśva became pregnant and bore a child.
<div n="lb"/>It was the Aśvinīdevas who took the child out by surgery.
<div n="lb"/>The boy became known as Māndhātā later. (Śloka 3,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 62, Droṇa Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(5) During the Mahābhārata battle the Aśvinīdevas
<div n="lb"/>handed over some Pārṣadas to the god, Skanda. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>38, Chapter 43, Śalya Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(6) The Aśvinīdevas like very much oblations of Ghee.
<div n="lb"/>The others who like it are Bṛhaspati, Pūṣan, Bhaga and
<div n="lb"/>Pāvaka. (Śloka 7, Chapter 65, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(7) The month of Āśvina (October-November) is the
<div n="lb"/>month of Aśvinīkumāras and if a man gives ghee to the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins freely in that month he will acquire more
<div n="lb"/>physical beauty. (Śloka 10, Chapter 65, Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(8) One who offers Ghee as oblation to the fire for
<div n="lb"/>twelve months in succession will reach the country of
<div n="lb"/>the Aśvinīkumāras. (Śloka 95, Chapter 107, Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(9) The great poet of Kerala, Vallathol, in his com-
<div n="lb"/>mentary on the 93rd Sūkta of the Ṛgveda states that
<div n="lb"/>there is a belief that the Aśvins and Candrasūryas (the
<div n="lb"/>Sun and Moon) are one and the same.
<div n="NI"/>(10) Dīrghaśravas son of Dīrghatamas once prayed to
<div n="lb"/>the Aśvinīdevas to get rains and it is said that they gave
<div n="lb"/>a downpour of sweet water. (Ṛgveda, Sūkta 112, Ṛk 11).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Once a sage named Gotama was lost in a desert
<div n="lb"/>and craved bitterly for drinking water. He prayed to the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīdevas for water and they dug a well itself in the
<div n="lb"/>desert and quenched the thirst of the sage. (Ṛk 9, Sūkta
<div n="lb"/>16, Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>(12) The sage Dadhyañc taught the Aśvinīdevas the
<div n="lb"/>technique, Madhuvidyā. There is an interesting story
[Page071-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>about it. It was Indra who taught this to Dadhyañc
<div n="lb"/>and while teaching him he had threatened that if he
<div n="lb"/>gave away that secret to anybody else his head would
<div n="lb"/>be cut off. Aśvinīdevas found a way to tide over this
<div n="lb"/>difficulty. They at first cut off his head and fixed the
<div n="lb"/>head of a horse on him. It was with the head of a
<div n="lb"/>horse that Dadhyañc taught them Madhuvidyā and
<div n="lb"/>as soon as the teaching was over his horse-head was
<div n="lb"/>cut off and the real head placed in its place. (Ṛk 22,
<div n="lb"/>Sūkta 116, Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>(13) The vehicle of the Aśvinīdevas is a donkey.
<div n="lb"/>Once this donkey in the disguise of a wolf went and
<div n="lb"/>stayed with Ṛjrāśva, son of the Rājaṛṣi Vṛṣāgīr. Ṛjrā-
<div n="lb"/>śva gave the wolf to eat hundred goats belonging to
<div n="lb"/>the people of the place. Vṛṣāgīr got angry at this act
<div n="lb"/>of his son and cursed him. The son became blind and
<div n="lb"/>he got back his eyesight by pleasing the Aśvinīdevas
<div n="lb"/>by prayer and offerings. (Ṛk 16, Sūkta 115, Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Once Suryā decided to give his daughter in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to the owner of the horse which would win a
<div n="lb"/>horse-race which Suryā would conduct. In the race the
<div n="lb"/>horse of the Aśvinīdevas won and they thus married
<div n="lb"/>Sūryā's daughter. (Ṛk 17, Sūkta 117, Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>(15) The Aśvinīkumāras killed an asura of name
<div n="lb"/>Viṣvak and destroyed his dynasty also. (Ṛk 16, Sūkta
<div n="lb"/>117, Ṛgveda).
