RĀMĀYAṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Rāmāyaṇa is considered to be the first
poetic composition in the world or at least in India,
and hence it is called the Ādi Kāvya (First Epic). It
is an epic as it contains descriptions and references to
ancient themes. Vālmīki is its author, and hence
Vālmīki is known as the ‘Ādi kavi” also. Vālmīki and
Śrī Rāma were contemporaries. During his life in exile
in the forest Rāma visited Vālmīkī's āśrama. It was
in this āśrama that Sītā lived after being abandoned
by Rāma. The connection in many ways of the life of
Vālmīki with the ‘Rāma story’ was an incentive for
him to write the Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Composing of Rāmāyaṇa.%} Once while returning from
the river Tamasā Vālmīki witnessed a hunter shooting
down one of a Krauñca (a kind of bird) couple. The
intense emotion created by the incident burst out as
follows in verse form.
<Poem>Mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhāṃ tvamagamaḥ
śāśvatīḥ samāḥ /
Yat krauñcamithunādekamavadhīḥ
kāmamohitam. //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Immediately Brahmā appeared on the scene and
advised Vālmīki to write the story of Rāma in the
same pattern as that verse. Brahmā taught him about
the past and the future of the history of Rāma. As
Sītā, Kuśa, and Lava were living in his āśrama Vālmīki
was well in the know about the present. In the above
[Page641-a+ 64]
background Vālmīki completed writing the Rāmāyaṇa
Story in 24,000 verses. The epic is divided into seven
kāṇḍas (sections) of five hundred chapters. The seven
sections are the Bālakāṇḍa, the Ayodhyākāṇḍa, the
Araṇya kāṇḍa, the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, the Sundara
Kāṇḍa, the Yuddha Kāṇḍa and the Uttarakāṇḍa.
<div n="NI"/>Vālmīki taught the poem to Lava and Kuśa and when
they went with Vālmīki to Ayodhyā during the
aśvamedhayajña of Śrī Rāma, they sang the poem in
the open assembly there.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Different views about the author.%} Tradition ascribes
the authorship of the Rāmāyaṇa to Vālmīki. But,
western scholars hold the view that a part of Bālakāṇḍa
and the whole of Uttarakāṇḍa are interpolations of a
future date. The following are the reasons for this view.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Two different texts are found for cantos one and
three of Bālakāṇḍa. In one of them many of the stories
mentioned in the other are missing. It may, therefore,
be surmised that the two texts were composed during
different periods.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) In the early texts of Rāmāyaṇa stories like Gaṅgā-
vataraṇam are not to be found. So they must be inter-
polations of a later period.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Only in Kāṇḍas one and seven is Śrī Rāma treated
as an incarnation. In the other Kāṇḍas he is considered
in the capacity of a hero only.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Uttarakāṇḍa is not to be found among the early
translations of Rāmāyaṇa into other languages.
<div n="NI"/>(v) In the Bālakāṇḍa it is stated that Vālmīki com-
posed the Rāmāyaṇa, taught it to Kuśa and Lava, and
that they recited the whole poem before Śrī Rāma at
Ayodhyā. Many of the things mentioned in this Kāṇḍa
are repeated in Uttarakāṇḍa, which, therefore, must
have been written by someone else.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The period of Rāmāyaṇa.%} According to Indian belief
Śrī Rāma lived at the end of Tretāyuga, which came to
its close in 8,67,100 B.C. As per Rāmāyaṇa Śrī Rāma
ruled the country for 11,000 years. He was forty years
old when he ascended the throne. Vālmīki began
writing the Rāmāyaṇa after Lavakuśas were born.
In the light of the above facts. certain scholars opine
that the Rāmāyaṇa was written near about 878000
B.C. But, western critics and some eastern critics do
not accept this view. Professor Jacobi holds the view
that the original of Mahābhārata is anterior to
Rāmāyaṇa. Most scholars do not agree with this view.
A great majority of critics are of opinion that Rāmāyaṇa
is anterior to Mahābhārata. They argue as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) The traditional belief in India is that Rāmāyaṇa
was written much earlier than Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Rāmāyaṇa makes no reference to any of the
characters of Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The Śrī Rāma story is referred to in many a
Jātaka story of the Buddhists.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Vālmīki has made no mention about the city of
Pāṭalīputra established near about 380 B.C. It is an
irrefutable fact that Śrī Rāma had passed by the city.
<div n="NI"/>(v) During the reign of emperor Aśoka the Prākṛta lan-
guage was spoken in the areas where the incidents men-
tioned in Rāmāyaṇa took place. But, Rāmāyaṇa was
written much anterior to the emergence of Prākṛta
language.
<div n="NI"/>According to Professor Keith Rāmāyaṇa was written in
300 B.C.
[Page641-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Different readings of Rāmāyaṇa.%} In various parts of
India three original texts or readings are found of the
original Rāmāyaṇa. In each of the three texts nearly
(1/3) of the portions differ from one another. The Bombay
text is popular in northern and southern India. The
second is the Bengal text. The third, the Kashmir text,
is popular in the north-western parts of India. The in-
ference to be made from the existence of these three
different texts is that the original epic was composed in
a Prākṛta language, which was most popular at the time
and that it was later translated into Sanskrit by differ-
ent persons at different times. This theory will
explain the existence of the different texts. For many
years it continued to be handed down from mouth to
month till it assumed written form in Sanskrit.
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Other Rāmāyaṇas.%} The Rāmāyaṇa story in other
forms and garbs, is also prevalent in India. One of
them is Vāsiṣṭharāmāyaṇa or Jñānavāsiṣṭha. The
authorship of it also is ascribed to Vālmīki. Most of
the Rāmāyaṇas like Vāsiṣṭhottararāmāyaṇa, Sītāvijaya,
Adbhutarāmāyaṇa, Adbhutottararāmāyaṇa etc. found
in different parts of India are believed to have been
written by Vālmīki. Adbhutarāmāyaṇa is composed of
twenty-seven cantos. According to this Rāmāyaṇa, it
was Sītā, who killed Rāvaṇa of ten heads. There is an-
other Rāmāyaṇa in Sanskrit called Adhyātma-Rāmāyaṇa.
It is a poem separated from Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa. It is
written in the form of a conversation between Umā
(Pārvatī) and Śiva. Ānanda-Rāmāyaṇa and Mūla-
Rāmāyaṇa extol the greatness of Hanūmān.
