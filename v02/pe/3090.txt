KĀLABRĀHMAṆA¦. A brahmin, who defeated Kāla.
<div n="lb"/>A great effulgence that emanated from his head two
<div n="lb"/>hundred years after his continuous Japa (Chanting of
<div n="lb"/>mantras) blocked the passage of sky-walkers (Devas)
<div n="lb"/>and spread to the three worlds. When Brahmā and
[Page371-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>others asked him to choose any boon, he said that he
<div n="lb"/>wanted nothing but chanting the Lord's name and
<div n="lb"/>mantras. Again, Brahmā insisted on the brahmin's
<div n="lb"/>choosing some boon or other, and then he removed
<div n="lb"/>himself to the northern planes of the Himālayas, where
<div n="lb"/>also he continued chanting mantras. There too his efful-
<div n="lb"/>gence became so powerful that Indra deputed celestial
<div n="lb"/>women to obstruct his Japa, but they could do nothing
<div n="lb"/>in the matter. Then Indra deputed Kāla to end the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin's life, but he failed in the attempt. Ultimately
<div n="lb"/>King Ikṣvāku came to the brahmin and asked for half
<div n="lb"/>the power he had earned by his tapas, which the
<div n="lb"/>brahmin readily granted. And, Ikṣvāku became thus
<div n="lb"/>famous all over the worlds. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Sūrya-
<div n="lb"/>prabhālambaka).
