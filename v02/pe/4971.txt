PĀÑCĀLIKA¦ (PĀÑCĀLIKEŚA). A Yakṣa who was
a son of Kubera. In some parts of Bhārata this Yakṣa
is worshipped as a deity. It is believed that Śiva had
given Pāñcālīka a boon that he who worships him
whether he be man or woman, young or old, would
become intoxicated with vigour. There is a story
behind Pāñcālika obtaining this boon:—
<div n="NI"/>When Satī who was insulted at the Dakṣayāga was
consumed by fire a bereaved Śiva sat inactive and
moody at a lonely place. When this continued for a
long time Kāmadeva (god of love) at the request of
the other devas sent arrows against him and made him
lustful. Śiva then started running passionately calling
the name of his wife and finding her nowhere jumped
into the river Kālindī to commit suicide. (The
waters of Kālindī became black from that time on-
wards). Kālindī was unable to bear the burden of
the soul of Śiva and so he had to get out to the shore
and run again. At this time Kāmadeva sent another
arrow, unmādāstra (arrow of intoxication) also against
Śiva. Śiva could not bear the impact of the two
arrows together and he laboured under great strain.
Just then he saw Pāñcālika son of Kubera coming that
way. Śiva then made him understand his difficulties
and requested him to take charge of the force of the
arrows from him. Pāñcālika did so and saved Śiva
from his toil. Pleased at this Śiva blessed him. He
said that Pāñcālika will be worshipped by people in
[Page552-b+ 65]
the month of Caitra and all those who do so will be
invigorated. He added that henceforth he would be
known as Pāñcālikeśa also.
