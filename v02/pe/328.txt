<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kidnapped by Uṣā.%} One of the stories about this
<div n="lb"/>handsome prince refers to his being kidnapped by Uṣā
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Bāṇāsura. Bāṇāsura, chief among the 100
<div n="lb"/>sons of emperor Mahābali had 1000 hands. Śiva pleased
<div n="lb"/>by the sacrificial devotion of Bāṇāsura granted, as
<div n="lb"/>requested by him, the boon that he himself (Śiva) and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī would guard the fort of the Asura, of course
<div n="lb"/>with some reluctance. Now, none had the prowess to
<div n="lb"/>attack this valiant Asura. Overflowing with conceit at
<div n="lb"/>this he challenged Śiva to a fight. Śiva foretold that
<div n="lb"/>the flagstaff of Bāṇa would one day be broken and
<div n="lb"/>then a powerful antagonist would defeat him. Bāṇa
<div n="lb"/>impatiently awaited the threatened day.
<div n="NI"/>One day Uṣā happened to witness the scene of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and Pārvatī engaged in love-making. Excited by the
<div n="lb"/>sight Uṣā too desired to enact such a scene with a lover,
<div n="lb"/>and she intimated her desire to Pārvatī. Pārvatī told
<div n="lb"/>her that Uṣā would, within three days, see in a dream
<div n="lb"/>a handsome prince with whom she might make love.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly, dressed herself in all glory with choicest
<div n="lb"/>ornaments Uṣā awaited the happy day. On the third
<div n="lb"/>day a handsome prince appeared before her in her
<div n="lb"/>dream. Waking up, she began crying. Seeing Uṣā crying
<div n="lb"/>Citralekhā, her companion, and daughter of her father's
<div n="lb"/>minister, assured her (Uṣā) that whoever might be the
<div n="lb"/>prince who appeared in her dream shall be brought
<div n="lb"/>down with the power of Mantra. Citralekhā drew the
<div n="lb"/>pictures of all princes known to her and showed them to
<div n="lb"/>Uṣā. The pictures represented all handsome men from
<div n="lb"/>Devas to men. ‘No, this is not my prince charming’ was
<div n="lb"/>Uṣā's reply. Then Citralekhā drew the picture of Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>of Pradyumna, and then of Aniruddha. When Uṣā saw
<div n="lb"/>Aniruddha's picture she stretched her hands to embrace
<div n="lb"/>that. It was this prince who had appeared before her
<div n="lb"/>in the dream.
<div n="NI"/>Next night Citralekhā, by the power of her Mantra,
<div n="lb"/>brought into Uṣā's room from Dvārakā Aniruddha, who
<div n="lb"/>was then in his sleep. While Uṣā and Aniruddha were
<div n="lb"/>thus together in the room her father, Bāṇa, got scent
<div n="lb"/>of it and took Aniruddha into custody.
<div n="NI"/>The disappearance of Aniruddha led to much commotion
<div n="lb"/>in Dvārakā. Then Nārada reached Dvārakā and gave
<div n="lb"/>details about the Aniruddha incident. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna, in all rage, hurried to Bāṇa's palace and
<div n="lb"/>encircled his palace with a strong army. Then did Bāṇa's
<div n="lb"/>flagstaff break into two and fell down. The fierce fight
<div n="lb"/>that ensued ended in the defeat of Bāṇa. Aniruddha
<div n="lb"/>married Uṣā and the elated couple started for Dvārakā.
<div n="lb"/>Vajra was the son of Aniruddha. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Chapters 61, 62 and 63).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%More information.%} (1) It was at the feet of Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>that Aniruddha mastered the Dhanurveda (Science
[Page043-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of warfare). (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse
