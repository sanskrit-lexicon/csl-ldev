<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kidnapped by Uṣā.%} One of the stories about this
handsome prince refers to his being kidnapped by Uṣā
daughter of Bāṇāsura. Bāṇāsura, chief among the 100
sons of emperor Mahābali had 1000 hands. Śiva pleased
by the sacrificial devotion of Bāṇāsura granted, as
requested by him, the boon that he himself (Śiva) and
Pārvatī would guard the fort of the Asura, of course
with some reluctance. Now, none had the prowess to
attack this valiant Asura. Overflowing with conceit at
this he challenged Śiva to a fight. Śiva foretold that
the flagstaff of Bāṇa would one day be broken and
then a powerful antagonist would defeat him. Bāṇa
impatiently awaited the threatened day.
<div n="NI"/>One day Uṣā happened to witness the scene of Śiva
and Pārvatī engaged in love-making. Excited by the
sight Uṣā too desired to enact such a scene with a lover,
and she intimated her desire to Pārvatī. Pārvatī told
her that Uṣā would, within three days, see in a dream
a handsome prince with whom she might make love.
Accordingly, dressed herself in all glory with choicest
ornaments Uṣā awaited the happy day. On the third
day a handsome prince appeared before her in her
dream. Waking up, she began crying. Seeing Uṣā crying
Citralekhā, her companion, and daughter of her father's
minister, assured her (Uṣā) that whoever might be the
prince who appeared in her dream shall be brought
down with the power of Mantra. Citralekhā drew the
pictures of all princes known to her and showed them to
Uṣā. The pictures represented all handsome men from
Devas to men. ‘No, this is not my prince charming’ was
Uṣā's reply. Then Citralekhā drew the picture of Śrī Kṛṣṇa
of Pradyumna, and then of Aniruddha. When Uṣā saw
Aniruddha's picture she stretched her hands to embrace
that. It was this prince who had appeared before her
in the dream.
<div n="NI"/>Next night Citralekhā, by the power of her Mantra,
brought into Uṣā's room from Dvārakā Aniruddha, who
was then in his sleep. While Uṣā and Aniruddha were
thus together in the room her father, Bāṇa, got scent
of it and took Aniruddha into custody.
<div n="NI"/>The disappearance of Aniruddha led to much commotion
in Dvārakā. Then Nārada reached Dvārakā and gave
details about the Aniruddha incident. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
Pradyumna, in all rage, hurried to Bāṇa's palace and
encircled his palace with a strong army. Then did Bāṇa's
flagstaff break into two and fell down. The fierce fight
that ensued ended in the defeat of Bāṇa. Aniruddha
married Uṣā and the elated couple started for Dvārakā.
Vajra was the son of Aniruddha. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
Skandha, Chapters 61, 62 and 63).
