PAÑCAŚIKHA¦. A sage of ancient times. The Purāṇas
give the following details about him.
<div n="NI"/>He was a disciple of Āsuri. He was brought up breast-
fed by Kapilā, wife of Āsuri and so he was known as
Kāpila also. He dwelt in Pañcasrotas and performed a
Yāga for a thousand years and got his name Pañcaśikha.
He went to the assembly of the learned king Janaka and
entered into a polemic contest with him and defeated
him. The defeated King gave Pañcaśikha great respect
and he lived in the court of Janaka as his Guru for a
number of years. (Chapter 218, Śānti Parva).
