<div n="NI"/>2). {%What the names of the months indicate.%}
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Malayālam months.%} The months are named based
on certain beliefs. It takes twelve months for the earth
to go round the Sun once. When the earth passes through
the twelve divisions, it faces a separate set of constella-
taions in the universe in each of these divisions. In the
month of Ciṅṅam the earth faces a cluster of constella-
tions in the shape of a lion and so the month is called
Siṃha (lion) or Ciṅṅam. In the next division the
earth faces the constellations in the shape of a Kanyakā
and so the month was called Kanni. The earth faces
next the constellations in the shape of a balance and so
the month was called Tulām (Tulā=balance). In the
next division the earth faces the constellations in the
shape of a scorpion and so the month was called Vṛś-
cikam (scorpion). The set of constellations which faces
the earth in the next division is shaped like a bow
(dhanus) and so the month got the name Dhanu. In the
next division the earth faces a set of constellations in
the shape of a Makaramatsya (makara-fish) and so
the month was called Makaram. Kumbha means a jar
and Mīnam means a fish and Meḍam (Meṣa) means
a goat and Iḍavam (Ṛṣabha) means an ox. The shapes
of the constellations in those divisions are like the things
mentioned and the months were so named after them.
In the next two divisions the constellations appear as
twins and a crab respectively and the months were so
called Mithunam (twins) and Karkaṭakam (crab).
<div n="NI"/>2). {%English months.%}
<div n="NI"/>i) January has come from the word Janus, the name of
a Roman devatā. Janus is twin-faced, one facing the front
and the other back.
<div n="NI"/>ii) February means ‘to purify’ and the festival of purifi-
cation of the Romans is conducted in that month.
<div n="NI"/>iii) March is Mars, a devatā of War. Rome was built
by the brave warrior Romulus. In his time there were
only ten months in a year and the number of days
in a month varied considerably. There were months
with twenty days and thirtyfive days. It was in the
year 700 B.C. that the then King of Rome, Numa,
divided the year into twelve months and added January
and February to it. Till then March was the first month
of the year.
<div n="NI"/>iv) April—Aperio means ‘blossoming’ and since the
trees and plants blossom in that month it got the name
of April.
<div n="NI"/>v) May is named after Maia daughter of the demigod
(devatā) Atlas. There is an opinion that it is named
after Maius, another name of Jupiter.
<div n="NI"/>vi) June gets its name after the devatā Juno though there
is a version that it is named after a Roman tribe called
Junius.
<div n="NI"/>vii) July was formerly known as Quintilis meaning the
fifth counting from March which was the first month of
the year till the time of Numa. It was to commemorate
the name of Julius Caesar that the name was changed
to July.
<div n="NI"/>viii) August. This month was formerly known as Sex-
tilis meaning the sixth month. But it was renamed Aug-
ust in honour of Augustus Caesar. But it still lacked
the importance of July as it contained thirtyone days and
August only thirty days. So Augustus took one day
from February and made the number of days in August
thirtyone.
<div n="NI"/>ix) September means the seventh month from March.
[Page492-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>x) October means the eighth month.
<div n="NI"/>xi) November means the ninth month.
<div n="NI"/>xii) December means the tenth month.
