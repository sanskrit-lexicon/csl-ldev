<div n="NI"/>2). {%What the names of the months indicate.%}
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Malayālam months.%} The months are named based
<div n="lb"/>on certain beliefs. It takes twelve months for the earth
<div n="lb"/>to go round the Sun once. When the earth passes through
<div n="lb"/>the twelve divisions, it faces a separate set of constella-
<div n="lb"/>taions in the universe in each of these divisions. In the
<div n="lb"/>month of Ciṅṅam the earth faces a cluster of constella-
<div n="lb"/>tions in the shape of a lion and so the month is called
<div n="lb"/>Siṃha (lion) or Ciṅṅam. In the next division the
<div n="lb"/>earth faces the constellations in the shape of a Kanyakā
<div n="lb"/>and so the month was called Kanni. The earth faces
<div n="lb"/>next the constellations in the shape of a balance and so
<div n="lb"/>the month was called Tulām (Tulā=balance). In the
<div n="lb"/>next division the earth faces the constellations in the
<div n="lb"/>shape of a scorpion and so the month was called Vṛś-
<div n="lb"/>cikam (scorpion). The set of constellations which faces
<div n="lb"/>the earth in the next division is shaped like a bow
<div n="lb"/>(dhanus) and so the month got the name Dhanu. In the
<div n="lb"/>next division the earth faces a set of constellations in
<div n="lb"/>the shape of a Makaramatsya (makara-fish) and so
<div n="lb"/>the month was called Makaram. Kumbha means a jar
<div n="lb"/>and Mīnam means a fish and Meḍam (Meṣa) means
<div n="lb"/>a goat and Iḍavam (Ṛṣabha) means an ox. The shapes
<div n="lb"/>of the constellations in those divisions are like the things
<div n="lb"/>mentioned and the months were so named after them.
<div n="lb"/>In the next two divisions the constellations appear as
<div n="lb"/>twins and a crab respectively and the months were so
<div n="lb"/>called Mithunam (twins) and Karkaṭakam (crab).
<div n="NI"/>2). {%English months.%}
<div n="NI"/>i) January has come from the word Janus, the name of
<div n="lb"/>a Roman devatā. Janus is twin-faced, one facing the front
<div n="lb"/>and the other back.
<div n="NI"/>ii) February means ‘to purify’ and the festival of purifi-
<div n="lb"/>cation of the Romans is conducted in that month.
<div n="NI"/>iii) March is Mars, a devatā of War. Rome was built
<div n="lb"/>by the brave warrior Romulus. In his time there were
<div n="lb"/>only ten months in a year and the number of days
<div n="lb"/>in a month varied considerably. There were months
<div n="lb"/>with twenty days and thirtyfive days. It was in the
<div n="lb"/>year 700 B.C. that the then King of Rome, Numa,
<div n="lb"/>divided the year into twelve months and added January
<div n="lb"/>and February to it. Till then March was the first month
<div n="lb"/>of the year.
<div n="NI"/>iv) April—Aperio means ‘blossoming’ and since the
<div n="lb"/>trees and plants blossom in that month it got the name
<div n="lb"/>of April.
<div n="NI"/>v) May is named after Maia daughter of the demigod
<div n="lb"/>(devatā) Atlas. There is an opinion that it is named
<div n="lb"/>after Maius, another name of Jupiter.
<div n="NI"/>vi) June gets its name after the devatā Juno though there
<div n="lb"/>is a version that it is named after a Roman tribe called
<div n="lb"/>Junius.
<div n="NI"/>vii) July was formerly known as Quintilis meaning the
<div n="lb"/>fifth counting from March which was the first month of
<div n="lb"/>the year till the time of Numa. It was to commemorate
<div n="lb"/>the name of Julius Caesar that the name was changed
<div n="lb"/>to July.
<div n="NI"/>viii) August. This month was formerly known as Sex-
<div n="lb"/>tilis meaning the sixth month. But it was renamed Aug-
<div n="lb"/>ust in honour of Augustus Caesar. But it still lacked
<div n="lb"/>the importance of July as it contained thirtyone days and
<div n="lb"/>August only thirty days. So Augustus took one day
<div n="lb"/>from February and made the number of days in August
<div n="lb"/>thirtyone.
<div n="NI"/>ix) September means the seventh month from March.
[Page492-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>x) October means the eighth month.
<div n="NI"/>xi) November means the ninth month.
<div n="NI"/>xii) December means the tenth month.
