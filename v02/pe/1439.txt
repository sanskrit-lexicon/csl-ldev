CANDRAHĀSA¦ (M). Rāvaṇa's sword. Rāvaṇa, in the
<div n="lb"/>course of his triumphal tour after receiving the boons
<div n="lb"/>from Brahman, subjugated kings, and marching north-
<div n="lb"/>ward reached the valleys of Mount Kailāsa. But, Nandi-
<div n="lb"/>keśvara stopped him there, and Rāvaṇa, threatening to
<div n="lb"/>throw away Śiva, master of Nandikeśvara along with
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa, put his twenty hands under it to pull it out,
<div n="lb"/>and the great mountain shook violently. Pārvatī got
<div n="lb"/>frightened and running upto Śiva embraced him.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, who divined the reason for all these with his eye of
<div n="lb"/>supreme knowledge grounded the mountain firmly on
<div n="lb"/>earth, crushing Rāvaṇa's hands under it. Unable to
<div n="lb"/>take away his arms from under the mountain, Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>remained there for about thousand years singing the
<div n="lb"/>praises of the Lord. At last Śiva appeared to Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and presented him with a sword called Candrahāsa.
<div n="lb"/>It was this sword which won victories for Rāvaṇa in
<div n="lb"/>future wars. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
