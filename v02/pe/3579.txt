KOLASAVRŪPA¦ (KOLATTUNĀḌU). After the decline
<div n="lb"/>of the second Cera empire in Kerala, several royal
<div n="lb"/>families such as Perumpaṭappu, Neḍuvirippu, Kolasva-
<div n="lb"/>rūpa, Veṇāṭu etc. came into power. Some details regard-
<div n="lb"/>ing the family of Kolasvarūpa are given below.
<div n="NI"/>In ‘Kerala Māhātmya’, it is given that Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>had made a Soma-Kṣatriya, as King of Cirakkal or
<div n="lb"/>Kolattunāḍu. According to ‘Keralotpatti’ it was Cera-
<div n="lb"/>mān Perumāl who did this. Logan says that Kolasva-
<div n="lb"/>rūpa came into being from the children born to the
<div n="lb"/>last Perumāl of the Veṇāṭu family. In the edicts Vīra-
<div n="lb"/>rāghavapaṭṭaya or Jūtaśāsana no mention is made
<div n="lb"/>about Kolattunāḍu. Both the families of Veṇāṭu and
<div n="lb"/>Kolattunāḍu, from very early times had observed
<div n="lb"/>the customary rites of taint, pollution, defilement etc.
<div n="lb"/>It is said in ‘Keralamāhātmya’ that Paraśurāma had
<div n="lb"/>enthroned the sons of two sisters in both the kingdoms.

<div n="lb"/>But no documents are available to prove that there
<div n="lb"/>was any connection between the two families till the 5th
<div n="lb"/>century M.E. (Malayālam Era). i.e. 14th century A.D.
<div n="lb"/>See under Kollavarṣa.
