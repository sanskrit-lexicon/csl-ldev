MANUSMṚTI¦. A code of conduct written by Manu
alias Mānavācārya who was the father of man-kind for
the harmonious existence of a social life. The book
contains twelve chapters. The first chapter deals with
the origin of the Smṛti and the origin of the world.

that this chapter must have been added to it later.
