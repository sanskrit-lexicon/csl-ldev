VĀGBHAṬA¦. A Sanskrit scholar who lived in the 12th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. He is the author of the two medical
<div n="lb"/>books ‘Aṣṭāṅga-saṅgraha’ and ‘Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya’. Another
<div n="lb"/>work called ‘Neminirvāṇa’ is also written by Vāgbhaṭa.
<div n="lb"/>This work deals with the story of Neminātha, a Jain
<div n="lb"/>hermit.
<div n="NI"/>Not much is known about Vāgbhaṭa. He was a scholar
<div n="lb"/>in rhetorical science. There are certain stories about
<div n="lb"/>his writing the medical books. It was a period when the
<div n="lb"/>Muslims had beaten down the Brahmins. They had
<div n="lb"/>taken away the medical science also from them. The
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins considered this to be a disgrace to them. They
<div n="lb"/>decided to select an intelligent boy and send him to a
<div n="lb"/>Muslim physician. They selected Vāgbhaṭa. The Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mins disguised Vāgbhaṭa as a Muslim boy and sent him
<div n="lb"/>to the Muslim Physician on the other side of the river.
<div n="lb"/>The boy went to the physician and told him that he
<div n="lb"/>was coming from far away with the intention of learning
<div n="lb"/>medical science. The teacher put certain questions
<div n="lb"/>and understood that the boy possessed extraordinary
<div n="lb"/>intelligence. He began to teach the boy the science
<div n="lb"/>of medicine. Seeing the interest of the boy the teacher
<div n="lb"/>asked the boy to eat food from his house and to learn
<div n="lb"/>day and night. The Brahmin boy did not like to eat
<div n="lb"/>the food of Muslims. The boy said that he had a relative
<div n="lb"/>on the other side of the river and that he would go
<div n="lb"/>there and have his supper and return for the night study.
<div n="lb"/>The teacher agreed and thenceforward Vāgbhaṭa
<div n="lb"/>began to learn day and night. Within a short time he
<div n="lb"/>completed learning.
<div n="NI"/>One day the teacher was sleeping on the seventh storey
<div n="lb"/>of the building and his disciple Vāgbhaṭa was massag-
<div n="lb"/>ing his legs. The boy soliloquised that fate had destined
<div n="lb"/>him to massage the legs of a Musalman. Instantly he
<div n="lb"/>cried bitterly, and the teacher awoke and understood
<div n="lb"/>that the boy was not a Muslim, and tried to cut his
<div n="lb"/>head. The boy thought: “The four Vedas and the six
<div n="lb"/>Śāstras say that there is a god. If it is true no harm
<div n="lb"/>will come to me.” Then he jumped out of the window.
<div n="lb"/>In consequence of this jump, he became a little lame
<div n="lb"/>and no other harm befell him. He swam across the
<div n="lb"/>river and reached the other side and told the Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>everything. The Brahmins asked him what he imagined
<div n="lb"/>when he jumped from the seventh storey. He replied
<div n="lb"/>“I jumped with this imagination. The four Vedas and
<div n="lb"/>the six Śāstras say that there is a god. If it is true no
<div n="lb"/>harm will come to me.” As soon as the boy had finish-
<div n="lb"/>ed the Brahmins became angry and they all got up.
<div n="lb"/>They said “You went wrong in using the doubtful ‘if’,
<div n="lb"/>instead of the affirmative ‘As.’ The Brahmins joined
<div n="lb"/>together and expelled him from the society. The boy
<div n="lb"/>thought of going away somewhere. “But there won't be
<div n="lb"/>another chance for somebody else to go and learn
<div n="lb"/>medical science from the Muslim physicians. So before
<div n="lb"/>going away from here I must make the fruits of my
<div n="lb"/>efforts available to these people.” Thinking so he lived
<div n="lb"/>there for a little longer. He lived there without ming-
<div n="lb"/>ling with the Brahmins, cooking his food. It is believed
<div n="lb"/>that Vāgbhaṭa wrote ‘Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha’ and ‘Aṣṭāṅga-
<div n="lb"/>hṛdaya,’ during this period.
