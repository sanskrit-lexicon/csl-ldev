NĀṬOṬIPPĀṬṬU¦. (FOLK-SONGS). Every literature
<div n="lb"/>has a section known as nāṭoṭippāṭṭus (folk songs). In
<div n="lb"/>Kerala (Malayālam) literature the period of folk songs
<div n="lb"/>was a golden era. Worship of devatās, honouring heroes,
<div n="lb"/>entertainments, philosophy, science, caste-professions,
<div n="lb"/>morals, ethics etc., generally formed the themes for
<div n="lb"/>folk songs. There are a number of folk-songs in Malayā-
<div n="lb"/>lam called Saṅghakkali, Tīyāṭṭu, Olappāvakkūttu,
<div n="lb"/>Ezhāmatu Kali, Kāṇippāṭṭu, Nāṭṭuppāṭṭu, Vaṭṭippāṭṭn,
<div n="lb"/>Pūrakkalippāṭṭu, Aṭaccuturappāṭṭu, (Pulluvarpāṭṭu,
<div n="lb"/>Nizhalkūttuppāṭṭu, Bhadrakālippāṭṭu, Tirayāṭṭu etc. All
<div n="lb"/>these songs are reflective of the spiritual thoughts and
<div n="lb"/>ideas of the masses. Also, there is a special series of
<div n="lb"/>folk-songs called Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus (songs of the north).
<div n="NI"/>All the Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus are heroic songs. They are
<div n="lb"/>folk-songs eulogising the heroic deeds and achievements
<div n="lb"/>of certain heroes and heroines of exceptional courage
<div n="lb"/>and prowess who flourished in olden days in north
<div n="lb"/>Malabar. Though there are more than four hundred
<div n="lb"/>such songs, only thirtyfive of them have been printed
<div n="lb"/>and published yet. These songs, which call for no
<div n="lb"/>special training or gifts for their singing or require any
<div n="lb"/>special knowledge in music for their appreciation, take
<div n="lb"/>their roots in the hearts of the common people. Almost
<div n="lb"/>all these songs are connected with Kalaris (schools
<div n="lb"/>where gymnastics are taught), Aṭavu (strategic feats of
<div n="lb"/>the duel fight), Payattu (physical training) and Aṅkam
<div n="lb"/>(fight). Descriptions of the challenges by heroes,
<div n="lb"/>clashing of arms and the way how youngsters get out of
<div n="lb"/>danger by their intelligence and prowess are really
<div n="lb"/>exciting and exhilarating to read.
<div n="NI"/>Most of the heroes in the Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus lived either
<div n="lb"/>in Kaṭattanāḍu or its suburbs. A good majority of the
<div n="lb"/>songs sings the praises of two powerful families Puttūram
<div n="lb"/>house and Taccolimāṇikkattu, the former a Tīya and
<div n="lb"/>the latter a Nāyar family. Taccolimāṇikkattu house
[Page534-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was at Meppa in Putuppaṇam village near Vaṭakara in
<div n="lb"/>Kaṭattanāḍu, and most of the songs relate to the great
<div n="lb"/>hero Otenakkuruppu of this house. Otenakkuruppu
<div n="lb"/>was born in 1584 A.D. and lived for thirtytwo years.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, the Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus may generally be placed
<div n="lb"/>in the 16th and 17th centuries A.D. Āromalcekavar,
<div n="lb"/>Āromaluṇṇi, Āṭṭummaṇamel Uṇṇiyārcca, Taccoli
<div n="lb"/>Otenan, Taccoli Candu, Pālāṭṭu Komappan, Bambāyi
<div n="lb"/>Ālikutty, Putunāṭan Kelu and Kalpparampil Kaṇṇan
<div n="lb"/>are the chief characters in the paṭṭus. Especially the
<div n="lb"/>song about Uṇṇiyārcca is thrilling. Brief notes about
<div n="lb"/>the heroes and their families in the pāṭṭus are given
<div n="lb"/>below.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Puttūram Vīṭu. (Puttūram House).%} Āromal Cekavar,
<div n="lb"/>Āṭṭuṃmaṇamel Uṇṇiyārcca and Āromaluṇṇi were the
<div n="lb"/>star heroes of the house. Uṇṇiyārcca was the sister of
<div n="lb"/>Āromalcekavar and mother of Āromaluṇṇi whose father
<div n="lb"/>was Kaṇṇappan. It may be understood from the song
<div n="lb"/>‘puttiriyaṅkam’ that Āromalcekavar was born to
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇṇappan when he was fortytwo years old. One or
<div n="lb"/>two songs about Āromalcekavar are extant, one about
<div n="lb"/>his playing a game of dice and the other about his
<div n="lb"/>fighting the ‘puttiriyaṅkam’.
<div n="NI"/>As for the game of dice, Āromalcekavar went to his
<div n="lb"/>uncle at Mikavil Mikaccerivīṭṭil—an expert in the game
<div n="lb"/>of dice—to study the art. There he spent a night with
<div n="lb"/>his uncle's daughter Tumpolārcca, who became preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant by him. Though people ridiculed her at this
<div n="lb"/>development Āromal Cekavar took her as his wife when
<div n="lb"/>she had delivered his child. Āromal Cekavar had also
<div n="lb"/>another wife called Kuñcuṇṇūli of Ālattūr house.
<div n="NI"/>With regard to the puttiriyaṅkam, Aromar as the Cekavar
<div n="lb"/>(Sevakan, one who served) of Uṇṇikkonār, once went to
<div n="lb"/>fight with Ariṅṅoṭar. Candu, his father's nephew,
<div n="lb"/>accompanied him as his assistant. Candu hated Āromar
<div n="lb"/>from the day the latter stood in his way of marrying
<div n="lb"/>Uṇṇiyārca.
<div n="NI"/>Ariṅṅoṭar brought over to his side Candu, assistant of
<div n="lb"/>Āromar. Āromar killed Ariṅṅoṭar in combat and on his
<div n="lb"/>way home he slept lying on the lap of Candu weary
<div n="lb"/>after the combat when the treacherous Candu thrust
<div n="lb"/>heated handle of the lamp into a wound in the stomach
<div n="lb"/>of Āromar, who managed to reach home only to die
<div n="lb"/>there.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Āṭṭummaṇamel Uṇṇiyārcca.%} Uṇṇiyārcca, overruling the
<div n="lb"/>opposition of her father-in-law and mother-in-law, one
<div n="lb"/>day went with her husband Kuñjurāman to witness
<div n="lb"/>Kūttu in the Allimalar temple. When they came to
<div n="lb"/>Eṭavaṭṭam market after passing Tānūr market certain
<div n="lb"/>ruffians confronted them. The coward that he was,
<div n="lb"/>Kuñjurāman trembled before the ruffians, but Uṇṇiyā-
<div n="lb"/>rcca routed them with her skill in combat.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Āromaluṇṇi.%} Āromaluṇṇi, who as a youth heard from
<div n="lb"/>his mother Uṇṇiyārcca the story about the treacherous
<div n="lb"/>killing of his uncle, Āromal Cekavar, by Candu rushed
<div n="lb"/>to Kolattunāḍu and killed the latter in combat.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Taccoli Otenan.%} Otenan was a powerful Nāyar
<div n="lb"/>(Kuruppu) born in Taccoli māṇikkattu house. His
<div n="lb"/>father was a nāyar chief well-known both as Putup-
<div n="lb"/>paṇattuvāzunnor and Cīnaṃvīṭṭil Taṅṅal. His mother
<div n="lb"/>was Uppāṭṭi, daughter of a woman called Teyi. He had
<div n="lb"/>an elder brother called Komappan and a younger sister
<div n="lb"/>called Uṇicciruta (Uṇiccira). Otenan's father begot a
<div n="lb"/>son (Kaṇṭācceri Cāppan) of Mākkaṃ, the maid-servant
<div n="lb"/>of Uppāṭṭi. Cāppan grew up to be a constant com-
[Page535-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>panion of Otenan. Komappan (Komakkuruppu)
<div n="lb"/>brother of Otenan was a peace-loving, sedate person.
<div n="lb"/>Otenan mastered all the tricks of Kalarippayattu at the
<div n="lb"/>gymnasium of Matiloor Gurukkal. Otenan had also
<div n="lb"/>mastered the use of the Urumi (a thin sword). He was
<div n="lb"/>such a master in the use of the Urumi that he could, by
<div n="lb"/>one sweep of it, graze the throat of a man without cut-
<div n="lb"/>ting and shedding a drop of blood. He was an expert
<div n="lb"/>in necromancy also. What could not be managed by
<div n="lb"/>the physical strength of Otenan, Cāppan used to manage
<div n="lb"/>with his intellectual powers.
<div n="NI"/>Otenan was born on the slope of a hill at Meppa one mile
<div n="lb"/>east of the present Vaṭakara railway station. Relics and
<div n="lb"/>remnants of Māṇikkattu family are there yet to be seen.
<div n="lb"/>Many songs have been composed about Otenan. One
<div n="lb"/>of them is his going to receive presents of cloth on Onam
<div n="lb"/>day from a stingy chief who, after the death of Otenan's
<div n="lb"/>father, had become ‘Putuppaṇattu Vāzhunnavar’.
<div n="lb"/>Another song relates to his collecting taxes from Kotu-
<div n="lb"/>mala Kuññikkaṇṇan on behalf of Rājā of Koṭṭayam. Yet
<div n="lb"/>another song is about his putting down the conceit and
<div n="lb"/>pride of Kuṅki amma of Kekki house. And, another song
<div n="lb"/>is about his killing Kaiteki Otenan Nambiyār. His fight
<div n="lb"/>with the māppilas on behalf of the Rājā of Cirakkal
<div n="lb"/>forms the theme of yet another song. Another interest-
<div n="lb"/>ing song is about his making Koṭṭakkal Kuññāli Marak-
<div n="lb"/>kār, who was a bosom friend of his, though a philanderer
<div n="lb"/>put on the attires of a female and thus teaching him a
<div n="lb"/>good lesson in life. Another song describes the escape
<div n="lb"/>of Otenan, who went to see the construction of the
<div n="lb"/>Karimala fort, with the help of Cāppan. There are also
<div n="lb"/>many other songs about Otenan.
<div n="NI"/>The very marriage of Otenan is an interesting story.
<div n="lb"/>Māteviamma of Kāvilum cāttottu had a daughter named
<div n="lb"/>Cīru. Māteviamma went to Māṇikkattu house and
<div n="lb"/>requested Otenan to marry her daughter Cīru. Otenan
<div n="lb"/>refused to oblige her. But, Cīru grew up to be very
<div n="lb"/>beautiful girl, and Otenan, who saw her in that state
<div n="lb"/>felt a great passion for her. He sent Cāppan to her for
<div n="lb"/>a pan (betel leaves for chewing) which she also refused.
<div n="lb"/>At last Cāppan took Otenan disguised as a blind person
<div n="lb"/>to Cīru's house. Cīru and Otenan got married without
<div n="lb"/>the knowledge of Cīru's mother, who cursed them when
<div n="lb"/>she knew about the marriage.
<div n="NI"/>There is another story about Otenan and Karuttaniṭam
<div n="lb"/>(Kaṭattanāṭu) Kuññikkanni, the only daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>Rājā of Kaṭattanāṭu. A rowdy called Kelappan of
<div n="lb"/>Ponnāpuram for forcibly carried her off. The Rājā,
<div n="lb"/>who tried to bring back his daughter had to return
<div n="lb"/>wounded. Otenan came to know that Ponnāpuram fort
<div n="lb"/>had once been given as dowry to his family and Kelap-
<div n="lb"/>pan was in illegal and forcible occupation of it. Otenan
<div n="lb"/>along with Cāppan went and captured the fort. He
<div n="lb"/>released Kuññikkanni from captivity and took Kelappan
<div n="lb"/>captive. The Rājā of Kaṭattanāṭu was very much
<div n="lb"/>pleased with this exploit of Otenan and married Kuññik-
<div n="lb"/>kanni to him.
<div n="NI"/>There is also a story about Otenan fighting with the
<div n="lb"/>māppilas of Cirakkal. The māppilas did not honour the
<div n="lb"/>Rājā of Cirakkal during one of his tours, and the Rājā
<div n="lb"/>asked Otenan to put down the haughtiness of the
<div n="lb"/>māppilas, and he did so. Kotamala Kuṅkiamma, the
<div n="lb"/>Rājā Pulināḍu, Matilūr Gurukkal and others are referred
<div n="lb"/>to in this story.
[Page535-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Katirūr Gurukkal was a very powerful enemy of Otenan.
<div n="lb"/>The Gurukkal one day kept his new gun leaning against
<div n="lb"/>a jack fruit tree, and Otenan, in derision, commented
<div n="lb"/>about it thus: “Who is it that has kept the spear made
<div n="lb"/>of earth leaning against the tree on which usually spear
<div n="lb"/>made of gold is kept so?” The Gurukkal, angry at the
<div n="lb"/>insult challenged Otenan for a combat within three
<div n="lb"/>months from Wednesday, the ninth of Kumbham. On the
<div n="lb"/>appointed day Otenan went to Gurukkal's combat field
<div n="lb"/>and killed him, Parintukūl Emmenpaniykar and others.
<div n="lb"/>On his way home after the victory, Otenan remembered
<div n="lb"/>that he had forgotten his dagger on the platform of the
<div n="lb"/>peepal tree, and paying no heed to the advice of his
<div n="lb"/>friends he returned to the combat field and got killed
<div n="lb"/>there.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Taccoli Candu.%} Candu was Otenan's nephew and was
<div n="lb"/>reputed for his great prowess. Mālu of Tāzhattu-
<div n="lb"/>maṭham was his wife. One day she went for worship
<div n="lb"/>in the Omallur temple where Kaṇḍar Menon of Tulu-
<div n="lb"/>nāṭan fort abducted her into his court. Candu was at
<div n="lb"/>the time, twentytwo years old. On hearing about his
<div n="lb"/>wife's mishap Candu, disguised as a Sannyāsin, entered
<div n="lb"/>the fort and fought singlehanded against Menon and
<div n="lb"/>his army of 400 soldiers.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Pālaṭṭu Koman.%} Koman Nāyar, another nephew of
<div n="lb"/>Otenan, the son of Kuṅkiamma of Kappullipalāṭṭu,
<div n="lb"/>became famous under the name Komappan. The family
<div n="lb"/>feud between the Kuruppus of Toṇṇūrāmvītu and the
<div n="lb"/>Nāyars of Pālāṭu was a long-standing affair. There
<div n="lb"/>were seven Kuruppus during the days of Koman, and
<div n="lb"/>they had two sisters named Uṇṇicciruta and Uṇṇiamma.
<div n="lb"/>Koman felt a great passion towards Uṇṇiamma, who
<div n="lb"/>was bathing in the tank, and her brothers rushed to kill
<div n="lb"/>Koman. But Koman outlived all obstacles created by
<div n="lb"/>the seven brothers of Uṇṇiamma and the tale-bearing
<div n="lb"/>Uṇicciruta because of the cleverness of the very intelli-
<div n="lb"/>gent Uṇṇiamma. Koman also got settled by Otenan
<div n="lb"/>the fortytwo items of family quarrels and married
<div n="lb"/>Uṇṇiamma.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Bambāyi Ālikkuṭṭi.%} In the song about Ādirāja it is
<div n="lb"/>said Ālikkuṭṭi, an expert in the science relating to ele-
<div n="lb"/>phants, was invited for help when the seventh elephant
<div n="lb"/>of the Rājā escaped back into the forest. Ālikkuṭṭi
<div n="lb"/>hailed from Bombay. According to the song under refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence Ālikkuṭṭi brought back the elephant from the
<div n="lb"/>forest to the Rājā, who, greatly pleased with him, gave
<div n="lb"/>his daughter, Kuññikkaṇṇi, in marriage to him.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Putunāṭan Kelu.%} Putunāṭan Candu and Kelu were
<div n="lb"/>brothers. Candu married a woman named Mātu.
<div n="lb"/>One Vaṭṭoli Menon became Mātu's paramour by brib-
<div n="lb"/>ing her with a golden chain worth three thousand
<div n="lb"/>paṇams, and she got her husband killed by this param-
<div n="lb"/>our. Candu had two dogs called Malli and Cokkan,
<div n="lb"/>and one of them kept guard over Candu's dead body
<div n="lb"/>while the other went and informed Kelu about Candu's
<div n="lb"/>death. Kelu in great rage, rushed to the place, saw the
<div n="lb"/>golden chain presented to Mātu by Menon and blinded
<div n="lb"/>one of her eyes.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Kurumparampil Kaṇṇan.%} This tīya youth had a very
<div n="lb"/>chaste wife called Āryā. One day when Kaṇṇan was
<div n="lb"/>away from home for tapping coconut palms for toddy
<div n="lb"/>Putukolottu rājā saw Āryā, and having felt a great pass-
<div n="lb"/>ion for her he presented her one night four pieces of
<div n="lb"/>silk and a gold ring. The next day Āryā dressed her
<div n="lb"/>husband as a brahmin with the sacred thread on, and
[Page536-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>deputed him to return to the Rājā's wife the presents
<div n="lb"/>made by her husband to her (Āryā). Kaṇṇan succeeded
<div n="lb"/>in his mission, but the revengeful Rājā ordered him to
<div n="lb"/>be executed. Āryā went to the Rājā and after vari-
<div n="lb"/>ous discussions with him returned home.
