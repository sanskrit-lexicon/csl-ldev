NĀṬOṬIPPĀṬṬU¦. (FOLK-SONGS). Every literature
has a section known as nāṭoṭippāṭṭus (folk songs). In
Kerala (Malayālam) literature the period of folk songs
was a golden era. Worship of devatās, honouring heroes,
entertainments, philosophy, science, caste-professions,
morals, ethics etc., generally formed the themes for
folk songs. There are a number of folk-songs in Malayā-
lam called Saṅghakkali, Tīyāṭṭu, Olappāvakkūttu,
Ezhāmatu Kali, Kāṇippāṭṭu, Nāṭṭuppāṭṭu, Vaṭṭippāṭṭn,
Pūrakkalippāṭṭu, Aṭaccuturappāṭṭu, (Pulluvarpāṭṭu,
Nizhalkūttuppāṭṭu, Bhadrakālippāṭṭu, Tirayāṭṭu etc. All
these songs are reflective of the spiritual thoughts and
ideas of the masses. Also, there is a special series of
folk-songs called Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus (songs of the north).
<div n="NI"/>All the Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus are heroic songs. They are
folk-songs eulogising the heroic deeds and achievements
of certain heroes and heroines of exceptional courage
and prowess who flourished in olden days in north
Malabar. Though there are more than four hundred
such songs, only thirtyfive of them have been printed
and published yet. These songs, which call for no
special training or gifts for their singing or require any
special knowledge in music for their appreciation, take
their roots in the hearts of the common people. Almost
all these songs are connected with Kalaris (schools
where gymnastics are taught), Aṭavu (strategic feats of
the duel fight), Payattu (physical training) and Aṅkam
(fight). Descriptions of the challenges by heroes,
clashing of arms and the way how youngsters get out of
danger by their intelligence and prowess are really
exciting and exhilarating to read.
<div n="NI"/>Most of the heroes in the Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus lived either
in Kaṭattanāḍu or its suburbs. A good majority of the
songs sings the praises of two powerful families Puttūram
house and Taccolimāṇikkattu, the former a Tīya and
the latter a Nāyar family. Taccolimāṇikkattu house
[Page534-b+ 65]
was at Meppa in Putuppaṇam village near Vaṭakara in
Kaṭattanāḍu, and most of the songs relate to the great
hero Otenakkuruppu of this house. Otenakkuruppu
was born in 1584 A.D. and lived for thirtytwo years.
Therefore, the Vaṭakkanpāṭṭus may generally be placed
in the 16th and 17th centuries A.D. Āromalcekavar,
Āromaluṇṇi, Āṭṭummaṇamel Uṇṇiyārcca, Taccoli
Otenan, Taccoli Candu, Pālāṭṭu Komappan, Bambāyi
Ālikutty, Putunāṭan Kelu and Kalpparampil Kaṇṇan
are the chief characters in the paṭṭus. Especially the
song about Uṇṇiyārcca is thrilling. Brief notes about
the heroes and their families in the pāṭṭus are given
below.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Puttūram Vīṭu. (Puttūram House).%} Āromal Cekavar,
Āṭṭuṃmaṇamel Uṇṇiyārcca and Āromaluṇṇi were the
star heroes of the house. Uṇṇiyārcca was the sister of
Āromalcekavar and mother of Āromaluṇṇi whose father
was Kaṇṇappan. It may be understood from the song
‘puttiriyaṅkam’ that Āromalcekavar was born to
Kaṇṇappan when he was fortytwo years old. One or
two songs about Āromalcekavar are extant, one about
his playing a game of dice and the other about his
fighting the ‘puttiriyaṅkam’.
<div n="NI"/>As for the game of dice, Āromalcekavar went to his
uncle at Mikavil Mikaccerivīṭṭil—an expert in the game
of dice—to study the art. There he spent a night with
his uncle's daughter Tumpolārcca, who became preg-
nant by him. Though people ridiculed her at this
development Āromal Cekavar took her as his wife when
she had delivered his child. Āromal Cekavar had also
another wife called Kuñcuṇṇūli of Ālattūr house.
<div n="NI"/>With regard to the puttiriyaṅkam, Aromar as the Cekavar
(Sevakan, one who served) of Uṇṇikkonār, once went to
fight with Ariṅṅoṭar. Candu, his father's nephew,
accompanied him as his assistant. Candu hated Āromar
from the day the latter stood in his way of marrying
Uṇṇiyārca.
<div n="NI"/>Ariṅṅoṭar brought over to his side Candu, assistant of
Āromar. Āromar killed Ariṅṅoṭar in combat and on his
way home he slept lying on the lap of Candu weary
after the combat when the treacherous Candu thrust
heated handle of the lamp into a wound in the stomach
of Āromar, who managed to reach home only to die
there.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Āṭṭummaṇamel Uṇṇiyārcca.%} Uṇṇiyārcca, overruling the
opposition of her father-in-law and mother-in-law, one
day went with her husband Kuñjurāman to witness
Kūttu in the Allimalar temple. When they came to
Eṭavaṭṭam market after passing Tānūr market certain
ruffians confronted them. The coward that he was,
Kuñjurāman trembled before the ruffians, but Uṇṇiyā-
rcca routed them with her skill in combat.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Āromaluṇṇi.%} Āromaluṇṇi, who as a youth heard from
his mother Uṇṇiyārcca the story about the treacherous
killing of his uncle, Āromal Cekavar, by Candu rushed
to Kolattunāḍu and killed the latter in combat.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Taccoli Otenan.%} Otenan was a powerful Nāyar
(Kuruppu) born in Taccoli māṇikkattu house. His
father was a nāyar chief well-known both as Putup-
paṇattuvāzunnor and Cīnaṃvīṭṭil Taṅṅal. His mother
was Uppāṭṭi, daughter of a woman called Teyi. He had
an elder brother called Komappan and a younger sister
called Uṇicciruta (Uṇiccira). Otenan's father begot a
son (Kaṇṭācceri Cāppan) of Mākkaṃ, the maid-servant
of Uppāṭṭi. Cāppan grew up to be a constant com-
[Page535-a+ 64]
panion of Otenan. Komappan (Komakkuruppu)
brother of Otenan was a peace-loving, sedate person.
Otenan mastered all the tricks of Kalarippayattu at the
gymnasium of Matiloor Gurukkal. Otenan had also
mastered the use of the Urumi (a thin sword). He was
such a master in the use of the Urumi that he could, by
one sweep of it, graze the throat of a man without cut-
ting and shedding a drop of blood. He was an expert
in necromancy also. What could not be managed by
the physical strength of Otenan, Cāppan used to manage
with his intellectual powers.
<div n="NI"/>Otenan was born on the slope of a hill at Meppa one mile
east of the present Vaṭakara railway station. Relics and
remnants of Māṇikkattu family are there yet to be seen.
Many songs have been composed about Otenan. One
of them is his going to receive presents of cloth on Onam
day from a stingy chief who, after the death of Otenan's
father, had become ‘Putuppaṇattu Vāzhunnavar’.
Another song relates to his collecting taxes from Kotu-
mala Kuññikkaṇṇan on behalf of Rājā of Koṭṭayam. Yet
another song is about his putting down the conceit and
pride of Kuṅki amma of Kekki house. And, another song
is about his killing Kaiteki Otenan Nambiyār. His fight
with the māppilas on behalf of the Rājā of Cirakkal
forms the theme of yet another song. Another interest-
ing song is about his making Koṭṭakkal Kuññāli Marak-
kār, who was a bosom friend of his, though a philanderer
put on the attires of a female and thus teaching him a
good lesson in life. Another song describes the escape
of Otenan, who went to see the construction of the
Karimala fort, with the help of Cāppan. There are also
many other songs about Otenan.
<div n="NI"/>The very marriage of Otenan is an interesting story.
Māteviamma of Kāvilum cāttottu had a daughter named
Cīru. Māteviamma went to Māṇikkattu house and
requested Otenan to marry her daughter Cīru. Otenan
refused to oblige her. But, Cīru grew up to be very
beautiful girl, and Otenan, who saw her in that state
felt a great passion for her. He sent Cāppan to her for
a pan (betel leaves for chewing) which she also refused.
At last Cāppan took Otenan disguised as a blind person
to Cīru's house. Cīru and Otenan got married without
the knowledge of Cīru's mother, who cursed them when
she knew about the marriage.
<div n="NI"/>There is another story about Otenan and Karuttaniṭam
(Kaṭattanāṭu) Kuññikkanni, the only daughter of the
Rājā of Kaṭattanāṭu. A rowdy called Kelappan of
Ponnāpuram for forcibly carried her off. The Rājā,
who tried to bring back his daughter had to return
wounded. Otenan came to know that Ponnāpuram fort
had once been given as dowry to his family and Kelap-
pan was in illegal and forcible occupation of it. Otenan
along with Cāppan went and captured the fort. He
released Kuññikkanni from captivity and took Kelappan
captive. The Rājā of Kaṭattanāṭu was very much
pleased with this exploit of Otenan and married Kuññik-
kanni to him.
<div n="NI"/>There is also a story about Otenan fighting with the
māppilas of Cirakkal. The māppilas did not honour the
Rājā of Cirakkal during one of his tours, and the Rājā
asked Otenan to put down the haughtiness of the
māppilas, and he did so. Kotamala Kuṅkiamma, the
Rājā Pulināḍu, Matilūr Gurukkal and others are referred
to in this story.
[Page535-b+ 65]
Katirūr Gurukkal was a very powerful enemy of Otenan.
The Gurukkal one day kept his new gun leaning against
a jack fruit tree, and Otenan, in derision, commented
about it thus: “Who is it that has kept the spear made
of earth leaning against the tree on which usually spear
made of gold is kept so?” The Gurukkal, angry at the
insult challenged Otenan for a combat within three
months from Wednesday, the ninth of Kumbham. On the
appointed day Otenan went to Gurukkal's combat field
and killed him, Parintukūl Emmenpaniykar and others.
On his way home after the victory, Otenan remembered
that he had forgotten his dagger on the platform of the
peepal tree, and paying no heed to the advice of his
friends he returned to the combat field and got killed
there.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Taccoli Candu.%} Candu was Otenan's nephew and was
reputed for his great prowess. Mālu of Tāzhattu-
maṭham was his wife. One day she went for worship
in the Omallur temple where Kaṇḍar Menon of Tulu-
nāṭan fort abducted her into his court. Candu was at
the time, twentytwo years old. On hearing about his
wife's mishap Candu, disguised as a Sannyāsin, entered
the fort and fought singlehanded against Menon and
his army of 400 soldiers.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Pālaṭṭu Koman.%} Koman Nāyar, another nephew of
Otenan, the son of Kuṅkiamma of Kappullipalāṭṭu,
became famous under the name Komappan. The family
feud between the Kuruppus of Toṇṇūrāmvītu and the
Nāyars of Pālāṭu was a long-standing affair. There
were seven Kuruppus during the days of Koman, and
they had two sisters named Uṇṇicciruta and Uṇṇiamma.
Koman felt a great passion towards Uṇṇiamma, who
was bathing in the tank, and her brothers rushed to kill
Koman. But Koman outlived all obstacles created by
the seven brothers of Uṇṇiamma and the tale-bearing
Uṇicciruta because of the cleverness of the very intelli-
gent Uṇṇiamma. Koman also got settled by Otenan
the fortytwo items of family quarrels and married
Uṇṇiamma.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Bambāyi Ālikkuṭṭi.%} In the song about Ādirāja it is
said Ālikkuṭṭi, an expert in the science relating to ele-
phants, was invited for help when the seventh elephant
of the Rājā escaped back into the forest. Ālikkuṭṭi
hailed from Bombay. According to the song under refer-
ence Ālikkuṭṭi brought back the elephant from the
forest to the Rājā, who, greatly pleased with him, gave
his daughter, Kuññikkaṇṇi, in marriage to him.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Putunāṭan Kelu.%} Putunāṭan Candu and Kelu were
brothers. Candu married a woman named Mātu.
One Vaṭṭoli Menon became Mātu's paramour by brib-
ing her with a golden chain worth three thousand
paṇams, and she got her husband killed by this param-
our. Candu had two dogs called Malli and Cokkan,
and one of them kept guard over Candu's dead body
while the other went and informed Kelu about Candu's
death. Kelu in great rage, rushed to the place, saw the
golden chain presented to Mātu by Menon and blinded
one of her eyes.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Kurumparampil Kaṇṇan.%} This tīya youth had a very
chaste wife called Āryā. One day when Kaṇṇan was
away from home for tapping coconut palms for toddy
Putukolottu rājā saw Āryā, and having felt a great pass-
ion for her he presented her one night four pieces of
silk and a gold ring. The next day Āryā dressed her
husband as a brahmin with the sacred thread on, and
[Page536-a+ 64]
deputed him to return to the Rājā's wife the presents
made by her husband to her (Āryā). Kaṇṇan succeeded
in his mission, but the revengeful Rājā ordered him to
be executed. Āryā went to the Rājā and after vari-
ous discussions with him returned home.
