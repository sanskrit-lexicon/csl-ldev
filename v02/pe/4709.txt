NAMUCI III¦. Another valiant captain of Hiraṇyākṣa.
<div n="lb"/>He sent five arrows against Indra in a fierce battle. But
<div n="lb"/>Indra cut all the five arrows in the midway. Then by
<div n="lb"/>his magic and sorcery Namuci spread darkness every-
<div n="lb"/>where. Indra defeated that strategy also. Then Namuci
<div n="lb"/>dashed forward and taking hold of the tusks of Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>shook Indra down. Indra stood up and cut off the head
<div n="lb"/>of Namuci with his sword. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi
