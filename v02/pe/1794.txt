[Page207-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>the system by which the wealth of parents is received by
<div n="lb"/>the heirs. The system of inheritance as described by Manu
<div n="lb"/>is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>1) After the death of the parents, all the children should
<div n="lb"/>divide their wealth among themselves. When either the
<div n="lb"/>father or the mother is alive, the sons should not take
<div n="lb"/>their wealth.
<div n="NI"/>2) If the wealth is not divided, the eldest brother should
<div n="lb"/>keep the whole of it in his custody and maintain his
<div n="lb"/>brothers and sisters like a father.
<div n="NI"/>3) Of the entire wealth, the eldest brother may take one-
<div n="lb"/>twentieth part, the second brother, one-fortieth part
<div n="lb"/>and the third brother, one-eghtieth part and the balance
<div n="lb"/>is to be divided equally among all of them.
<div n="NI"/>4) If there are more than three sons, the eldest and the
<div n="lb"/>youngest may take one-twentieth and one-eightieth (of
<div n="lb"/>the entire wealth) respectively, and each of the other
<div n="lb"/>brothers may take one-fortieth. The rest of the pro-
<div n="lb"/>perty must be divided equally among all of them.
<div n="NI"/>5) After dividing like this, if there are unmarried sisters,
<div n="lb"/>each of the brothers should give one-fourth of his share
<div n="lb"/>for their marriage.
<div n="NI"/>6) The ornaments which the mother had received by
<div n="lb"/>way of her dowry etc. may be taken after her death by
<div n="lb"/>her unmarried daughters.
<div n="NI"/>7) If, after his marriage, one of the brothers dies, the
<div n="lb"/>brother who keeps his movable and immovable proper-
<div n="lb"/>ties, must beget children by the brother's wife and hand
<div n="lb"/>over the above properties to her issue. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Manusmṛti).
