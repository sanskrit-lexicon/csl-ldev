KṚŚA¦. I. A friend of sage Śṛṅgī. Since Kṛśa underwent
a lot of sacrifices for the protection of dharma (righte-
ousness) his body became very Kṛśa (lean). Hence he
was called Kṛśa. It was Kṛśa, who told Śṛṅgī about
King Parīkṣit who had once thrown a dead snake round
his (Śṛṅgī's) father's neck. (Ādi Parva, Chapters 41
and 42).
