KṚŚA¦. I. A friend of sage Śṛṅgī. Since Kṛśa underwent
<div n="lb"/>a lot of sacrifices for the protection of dharma (righte-
<div n="lb"/>ousness) his body became very Kṛśa (lean). Hence he
<div n="lb"/>was called Kṛśa. It was Kṛśa, who told Śṛṅgī about
<div n="lb"/>King Parīkṣit who had once thrown a dead snake round
<div n="lb"/>his (Śṛṅgī's) father's neck. (Ādi Parva, Chapters 41
<div n="lb"/>and 42).
