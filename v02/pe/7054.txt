SUKUMĀRA IV¦. A Sanskrit poet. There is a story
<div n="lb"/>about the devotion of Sukumāra to his teacher. Though
<div n="lb"/>Sukumāra was a dutiful student his teacher used to
<div n="lb"/>scold him always. Consequently Sukumāra harboured
<div n="lb"/>malice in his heart against his teacher. One night
<div n="lb"/>Sukumāra got on the upper attic of the house of the
<div n="lb"/>teacher with a big stone. His aim was to drop the
<div n="lb"/>stone on the head of the teacher. But that night the
<div n="lb"/>conversation of the teacher and his wife was about
<div n="lb"/>Sukumāra. The wife asked the teacher why he was
<div n="lb"/>scolding his disciple so often, when he was so dutiful
<div n="lb"/>and righteous. The teacher said that he loved him
<div n="lb"/>most and that the chastisement was meant to make him
<div n="lb"/>better and better. When Sukumāra heard this his heart
<div n="lb"/>was broken. With tears in his eyes, he got down with
<div n="lb"/>the stone and disappeared in darkness.
<div n="NI"/>Next morning Sukumāra had no peace of mind. He
<div n="lb"/>approached the teacher. He asked the teacher “What
<div n="lb"/>is the punishment destined for him who had tried to
<div n="lb"/>kill his teacher?” The teacher replied that he should
<div n="lb"/>die a slow death in the fire made by the husk of paddy.
<div n="lb"/>Instantly Sukumāra made a pit and stood in it and
<div n="lb"/>filled the pit with husk up to his neck and set fire to
<div n="lb"/>the pile. When the teacher knew that the culprit was
<div n="lb"/>Sukumāra, he was filled with grief. He tried his best to
<div n="lb"/>dissuade his beloved disciple from his attempt. But it
<div n="lb"/>was in vain. While he was slowly burning in the fire
<div n="lb"/>he composed and sang the great poem ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa
[Page762-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Vilāsa’. The poet was not able to complete the twelfth
<div n="lb"/>Sarga of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Vilāsa.
<div n="NI"/>The sixty-sixth stanza was the last one he sang. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa was showing Satyabhāmā, the various countries
<div n="lb"/>and describing the prominence of each, when they had
<div n="lb"/>reached the earth after obtaining the Pārijāta flowers
<div n="lb"/>from the world of the gods. After having described the
<div n="lb"/>kingdoms of Pāṇḍya and Cola, the poet was beginning
<div n="lb"/>to describe the natural beauty of ‘Saptakoṅkaṇas’ (the
<div n="lb"/>seven Koṅkaṇa countries). The story says that when
<div n="lb"/>he had sung the last line of that stanza his tongue was
<div n="lb"/>burnt and he could not proceed with the rest of the
<div n="lb"/>poem.
