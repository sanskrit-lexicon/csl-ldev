SUKUMĀRA IV¦. A Sanskrit poet. There is a story
about the devotion of Sukumāra to his teacher. Though
Sukumāra was a dutiful student his teacher used to
scold him always. Consequently Sukumāra harboured
malice in his heart against his teacher. One night
Sukumāra got on the upper attic of the house of the
teacher with a big stone. His aim was to drop the
stone on the head of the teacher. But that night the
conversation of the teacher and his wife was about
Sukumāra. The wife asked the teacher why he was
scolding his disciple so often, when he was so dutiful
and righteous. The teacher said that he loved him
most and that the chastisement was meant to make him
better and better. When Sukumāra heard this his heart
was broken. With tears in his eyes, he got down with
the stone and disappeared in darkness.
<div n="NI"/>Next morning Sukumāra had no peace of mind. He
approached the teacher. He asked the teacher “What
is the punishment destined for him who had tried to
kill his teacher?” The teacher replied that he should
die a slow death in the fire made by the husk of paddy.
Instantly Sukumāra made a pit and stood in it and
filled the pit with husk up to his neck and set fire to
the pile. When the teacher knew that the culprit was
Sukumāra, he was filled with grief. He tried his best to
dissuade his beloved disciple from his attempt. But it
was in vain. While he was slowly burning in the fire
he composed and sang the great poem ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa
[Page762-b+ 64]
Vilāsa’. The poet was not able to complete the twelfth
Sarga of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Vilāsa.
<div n="NI"/>The sixty-sixth stanza was the last one he sang. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa was showing Satyabhāmā, the various countries
and describing the prominence of each, when they had
reached the earth after obtaining the Pārijāta flowers
from the world of the gods. After having described the
kingdoms of Pāṇḍya and Cola, the poet was beginning
to describe the natural beauty of ‘Saptakoṅkaṇas’ (the
seven Koṅkaṇa countries). The story says that when
he had sung the last line of that stanza his tongue was
burnt and he could not proceed with the rest of the
poem.
