PATĀLARĀVAṆA¦. A leader among the demons. Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>the lord of Laṅkā, and Pātālarāvaṇa are different.
<div n="lb"/>Pātālarāvaṇa was the son of the sister of Mālyavān. Heti,
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā, begot of his wife Bhayā a son named
<div n="lb"/>Vidyutkeśa. Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā and got of
<div n="lb"/>her Sukeśa. Sukeśa married Devavatī and got of her
<div n="lb"/>three sons, Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī. Of these
<div n="lb"/>Sumālī got Prahasta and others who were the ministers
<div n="lb"/>of Rāvaṇa. Pātāla-Rāvaṇa was the son of Mālyavān's
<div n="lb"/>sister.
<div n="NI"/>A set of demons afraid of Mahāviṣṇu, the destroyer of
<div n="lb"/>demons, fled to Pātāla. Their leader was Pātālarāvaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>On reaching Pātāla he became their leader and emperor
<div n="lb"/>and he got the name of Pātālarāvaṇa from then
<div n="lb"/>onwards.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa performed severe austerities to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and got from him three extraordinary boons:—
<div n="lb"/>(1) To travel freely in all the worlds without the use of
<div n="lb"/>any vehicle (2) To be well-versed in all magical arts
<div n="lb"/>(3) To be alive till the beetle-shaped blue diamond in
<div n="lb"/>his possession is broken into two.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa used all these boons for the welfare and
<div n="lb"/>emancipation of his own people. He was interested in
<div n="lb"/>teasing his enemies by the power of his boons. Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>king of Laṅkā, had an alliance with Pātālarāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa had a cruel and huge brother named
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhodara who was an adept in magic. This
<div n="lb"/>brother always helped Pātāla-Rāvaṇa in all his activi-
<div n="lb"/>ties.
<div n="NI"/>The Rāma-Rāvaṇa Yuddha was going on and Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>began to suffer defeat after defeat in quick succession.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa then sent for Pātālarāvaṇa and his brother
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhodara. Pātālarāvaṇa felt sorry at the pitiable
<div n="lb"/>plight of Laṅkā and both the Rāvaṇas sat together to
<div n="lb"/>discuss future plans. Though they had lost a major
<div n="lb"/>portion of their army, Rāvaṇa suggested they should
<div n="lb"/>fight with the rest of the army and kill Rāma. Pātāla-
<div n="lb"/>rāvaṇa was to kill Rāma and Laṅkā-Rāvaṇa was to
<div n="lb"/>marry Sītā. Pātālarāvaṇa said that it was unwise to
<div n="lb"/>continue the fight with a small army but promised he
<div n="lb"/>would make a trial by using his magic powers.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa and Kumbhodara on leaving Laṇkā made
<div n="lb"/>themselves invisible and travelled above the camp of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma to investigate the strength and manoeuvres of
<div n="lb"/>the Rāma-army. It was night and the whole place was
<div n="lb"/>lit by moonlight. The monkey soldiers were taking rest
<div n="lb"/>in different places. Vibhīṣaṇa and Sugrīva were talking
[Page582-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>in secret about grave matters. Śrī Rāma was lying
<div n="lb"/>resting his head on the lap of Lakṣmaṇa and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was mildly massaging the divine body of his brother.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān was sitting on a big dais created by his tail
<div n="lb"/>and keeping watch over the whole camp.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa knew from what he saw that any attempt
<div n="lb"/>to carry away Rāma from the surface of the ground was
<div n="lb"/>impossible and so he returned to Pātāla. From there
<div n="lb"/>they made a tunnel up to the base of the seat of Hanū-
<div n="lb"/>mān and from there to where Rāma lay. Then
<div n="lb"/>they carried Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Pātāla before any-
<div n="lb"/>body could find it out by making them smell a sammoh-
<div n="lb"/>anadivyauṣadha (divine medicine causing unconscious
<div n="lb"/>ness). They brought them to a temple of Mahākālī
<div n="lb"/>with the intention of offering them in a sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>to the deity the next day morning. They made
<div n="lb"/>all preparations for the same. Hanūmān used to inspect
<div n="lb"/>the camp often and yet when after midnight he looked
<div n="lb"/>at the place where Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were sleeping
<div n="lb"/>he could not find them. He immediately woke up all
<div n="lb"/>and made a search and they then found the big hole of
<div n="lb"/>a tunnel near the place where Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>were sleeping. All the leaders including Sugrīva and
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa assembled there and then Vibhīṣaṇa told
<div n="lb"/>them what had happened. He then took Sugrīva,
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān, Jāmbavān and Aṅgada and a big army to
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla and went straight to the Mahākālī temple.
<div n="lb"/>There Pātālarāvaṇa had already started the ceremonies
<div n="lb"/>for the sacrifice.
<div n="NI"/>Vibhīṣaṇa then asked Hanūmān to go and get the
<div n="lb"/>beetle-shaped diamond of Pātālarāvaṇa from a secret
<div n="lb"/>place in his bed chamber. Hanūmān took it and kept
<div n="lb"/>it in his mouth and attacked Pātālarāvaṇa who came
<div n="lb"/>running to slay him. Pātāla-Rāvaṇa faced Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>in a very indifferent manner and a fight ensued. After
<div n="lb"/>sometime Hanūmān lost patience and cracked the
<div n="lb"/>diamond within his mouth and the moment it cracked
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla-Rāvaṇa fell down dead. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
