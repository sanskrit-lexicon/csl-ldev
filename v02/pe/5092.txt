PATĀLARĀVAṆA¦. A leader among the demons. Rāvaṇa,
the lord of Laṅkā, and Pātālarāvaṇa are different.
Pātālarāvaṇa was the son of the sister of Mālyavān. Heti,
son of Brahmā, begot of his wife Bhayā a son named
Vidyutkeśa. Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā and got of
her Sukeśa. Sukeśa married Devavatī and got of her
three sons, Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī. Of these
Sumālī got Prahasta and others who were the ministers
of Rāvaṇa. Pātāla-Rāvaṇa was the son of Mālyavān's
sister.
<div n="NI"/>A set of demons afraid of Mahāviṣṇu, the destroyer of
demons, fled to Pātāla. Their leader was Pātālarāvaṇa.
On reaching Pātāla he became their leader and emperor
and he got the name of Pātālarāvaṇa from then
onwards.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa performed severe austerities to propitiate
Brahmā and got from him three extraordinary boons:—
(1) To travel freely in all the worlds without the use of
any vehicle (2) To be well-versed in all magical arts
(3) To be alive till the beetle-shaped blue diamond in
his possession is broken into two.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa used all these boons for the welfare and
emancipation of his own people. He was interested in
teasing his enemies by the power of his boons. Rāvaṇa,
king of Laṅkā, had an alliance with Pātālarāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa had a cruel and huge brother named
Kumbhodara who was an adept in magic. This
brother always helped Pātāla-Rāvaṇa in all his activi-
ties.
<div n="NI"/>The Rāma-Rāvaṇa Yuddha was going on and Rāvaṇa
began to suffer defeat after defeat in quick succession.
Rāvaṇa then sent for Pātālarāvaṇa and his brother
Kumbhodara. Pātālarāvaṇa felt sorry at the pitiable
plight of Laṅkā and both the Rāvaṇas sat together to
discuss future plans. Though they had lost a major
portion of their army, Rāvaṇa suggested they should
fight with the rest of the army and kill Rāma. Pātāla-
rāvaṇa was to kill Rāma and Laṅkā-Rāvaṇa was to
marry Sītā. Pātālarāvaṇa said that it was unwise to
continue the fight with a small army but promised he
would make a trial by using his magic powers.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa and Kumbhodara on leaving Laṇkā made
themselves invisible and travelled above the camp of
Śrī Rāma to investigate the strength and manoeuvres of
the Rāma-army. It was night and the whole place was
lit by moonlight. The monkey soldiers were taking rest
in different places. Vibhīṣaṇa and Sugrīva were talking
[Page582-b+ 65]
in secret about grave matters. Śrī Rāma was lying
resting his head on the lap of Lakṣmaṇa and Lakṣmaṇa
was mildly massaging the divine body of his brother.
Hanūmān was sitting on a big dais created by his tail
and keeping watch over the whole camp.
<div n="NI"/>Pātālarāvaṇa knew from what he saw that any attempt
to carry away Rāma from the surface of the ground was
impossible and so he returned to Pātāla. From there
they made a tunnel up to the base of the seat of Hanū-
mān and from there to where Rāma lay. Then
they carried Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Pātāla before any-
body could find it out by making them smell a sammoh-
anadivyauṣadha (divine medicine causing unconscious
ness). They brought them to a temple of Mahākālī
with the intention of offering them in a sacrifice
to the deity the next day morning. They made
all preparations for the same. Hanūmān used to inspect
the camp often and yet when after midnight he looked
at the place where Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were sleeping
he could not find them. He immediately woke up all
and made a search and they then found the big hole of
a tunnel near the place where Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
were sleeping. All the leaders including Sugrīva and
Vibhīṣaṇa assembled there and then Vibhīṣaṇa told
them what had happened. He then took Sugrīva,
Hanūmān, Jāmbavān and Aṅgada and a big army to
Pātāla and went straight to the Mahākālī temple.
There Pātālarāvaṇa had already started the ceremonies
for the sacrifice.
<div n="NI"/>Vibhīṣaṇa then asked Hanūmān to go and get the
beetle-shaped diamond of Pātālarāvaṇa from a secret
place in his bed chamber. Hanūmān took it and kept
it in his mouth and attacked Pātālarāvaṇa who came
running to slay him. Pātāla-Rāvaṇa faced Hanūmān
in a very indifferent manner and a fight ensued. After
sometime Hanūmān lost patience and cracked the
diamond within his mouth and the moment it cracked
Pātāla-Rāvaṇa fell down dead. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa).
