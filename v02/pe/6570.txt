ŚIBI V¦. An ancient Rājarṣi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—
Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-Nahuṣa-
Yayāti-Anudruhyu-Sabhānara-Kālanara-Sṛñjaya-
Uśīnara-Śibi.
<div n="NI"/>Śibi was born to Uśīnara of Mādhavī, daughter of
Yayāti.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Suhotra made to give way.%} King Suhotra of Kuru
dynasty once on his return from a visit of maharṣis saw
King Śibi coming in the opposite direction in his
chariot, and both the Kings saluted each other as their
age ordained. But, they did not give passage to each
other as they thought themselves to be equal in merit.
At that time Nārada came there and asked the kings
why they stood there thus blocking the path. They
answered Nārada thus: “He who is more noble or
clever on account of former actions etc. is usually
given way to by the other person. Both of us are
comrades and are equals.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada then spoke as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Oh! King of the Kuru dynasty! You are cruel to the
gentle and gentle to the cruel. To the evil you are
good; then why not be good to the good. Devas have
ordered that he who does good will get it hundred-
fold by return. King Uśīnara is more noble and gentle
than you are. The miser is won over by liberality,
the liar by truth, the cruel by patience and the evil
person by good. But, both of you Kings are noble
persons. Therefore, one of you should give way to the
other.”
<div n="NI"/>Listening to Nārada's advice, Suhotra gave way to
Śibi and proceeded on his way. (Vana Parva, Chapter
194).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śibi tested.%} Śibi's fame spread in the three worlds,
and an idea was mooted among the Devas that it should
be tested how much of the reputation of the King was
genuine. Accordingly, Agni in the form of a dove
and Indra in that of a kite hunting after the dove,
rushed to King Śibi. The dove took refuge in the lap
of the King sitting in ‘divya’ posture, and the priest
told the King that it was the latter's duty to protect
the dove, which took refuge with him for its life. The
dove also told the King thus; “I am really a muni,
who has entered the body of the dove. I take refuge
in you for my life.”
<div n="NI"/>By that time the kite too had flown up to the King. It
asked the King to return the dove, which it had been
chasing. The King was surprised to hear the kite talk
and told the bird that it was not proper for him to give
up the dove who had sought refuge under him, but
that he would give the kite any other flesh in lieu of the
[Page716-a+ 64]
dove. The kite replied as follows: “You must give me
flesh cut from your right thigh equal in weight to that
of the dove. If you do so, the dove will be saved and
you will be praised by people.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly, the King cut a piece of flesh from his
right thigh and weighed it in the balance against the
dove. But, the dove weighed more. The King cut more
flesh from his thigh and weighed, but the dove still
weighed more. Thus, by instalments the King cut his
whole body and weighed the flesh against the dove,
yet it weighed more. Then the King himself sat in the
balance, seeing which the kite flew away. Then the
dove assumed its original form and told the King that
it was Agni and the kite, Indra. The Devas were
greatly pleased with the firm sense of sacrifice of the
King; they blessed him and told him that a son called
Kapotaromā will be born to him. (Vana Parva, Chap-
ter 197).
