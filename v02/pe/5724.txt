ṚCĪKA¦ I (AJĪGARTA). A famous sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu were descended in the follow-
ing order-Brahmā-Bhṛgu-Cyavana-Ūrva-Ṛcīka. Ṛcīka
was the father of Jamadagni and grandfather of Paraśu-
rāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ṛcīka's marriage.%} Gādhi, a king of the Lunar dynasty
had a daughter, Satyavatī. Ṛcīka wished to marry this
beautiful princess. Gādhi agreed to give his daughter
in marriage to the sage if he gave 1,000 horses with
black ears. Ṛcīka offered worship to Varuṇa to help him
in the matter. Varuṇa was pleased and a thousand
horses rose up from the river Gaṅgā. Ṛcīka married
Satyavatī after giving the horses. Afterwards both of
them went and settled down in the forest.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth of Jamadagni.%} One day Satyavatī made a request
to Ṛcīka that she should have a son. Besides, she request-
ed him that her mother should be blessed with a son,
so that she might have a brother. Ṛcīka performed a
“homa” and after that he made two balls of rice and
gave them to Satyavatī. He advised her to eat one of
them and to give the other to her mother. Ṛcīka had put
“Brahmatejas” (brilliance of Brahmins) in the first rice-
ball and “Kṣātratejas” (brilliance of Kṣatriyas) in the
other. When Satyavatī and her mother ate the rice-
balls, it so happened that the rice-ball intended for her
mother was eaten by Satyavatī and the one intended for
Satyavatī was eaten by the mother. Later Ṛcīka came to
know of this mistake. In due course, Satyavatī and her
mother gave birth to sons, Satyavatī's son was named
Viśvāmitra. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 57).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other sons of Ṛcīka.%} After this three more sons were born
to Ṛcīka. The eldest of them was named Śunaḥpuccha,
the second was named Śunaśśepha and the third,
Śunolāṅgūla.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The sale of Śunaśśepha.%} Once king Ambarīṣa started a
yāga. Indra who was jealous of him, stole the sacrificial
cow. Since it was an evil omen, the priest advised Am-
barīṣa that either the lost cow or a human being in its place
must be obtained to complete the yāga. In spite of sear-
ches made in many places, the cow could not be traced.
At last Ambarīṣa's men met Ṛcīka who was doing tapas
on Bhṛgutuṅga. Ṛcīka sold his second son, Śunaśśepha
to Aṃbarīṣa in exchange for the price of 100,000 cows.
[Page648-a+ 63]
The king took Śunaśśepha with him and came to Puṣkara-
tīrtha. There they happened to meet Viśvāmitra.
Śunaśśepha complained to Viśvāmitra and lamented
over his ill-fate. Viśvāmitra wished to save him and to
send one of his own sons in his place with Ambarīṣa.
But none of his sons was willing to oblige. Viśvāmitra
cursed them and turned them into eaters of human
flesh. Then he turned to Śunaśśepha and said:
<div n="NI"/>“When you stand ready to be sacrificed near the altar,
offer your prayers to Agni. If you do so, you will attain
siddhi.” (salvation or mokṣa). He also taught him two
songs of praise to Agni.
<div n="NI"/>While standing at the altar ready to be sacrificed
Sunaśśepha recited the two songs of praise. Indra and
the other gods appeared and after saving Śunaśśepha
rewarded Ambarīṣa for his yāga. (Vālmīki Ramāyaṇa,
Bālakāṇḍa, 62nd Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Ṛcīka and the Vaiṣṇava bow.%} Once Viśvakarmā made two
mighty bows. One of them was taken by Śiva to burn
the Tripuras. That bow is known as “Śaivacāpa”. The
other bow was given to Viṣṇu. It is called “Vaiṣṇava-
cāpa”. The Devas wished to see a trial of strength bet-
ween Śiva and Viṣṇu. They prompted Brahmā to bring
about such a conflict. Brahmā succeeded in causing a
quarrel between Śiva and Viṣṇu. A fight began between
Śiva and Viṣṇu. Both the Śaivacāpa and Vaiṣṇavacāpa
went into action. But Śiva was defeated. After that, Siva
gave his bow to Devarāta, king of Videha. By inheritance
it came into the hands of king Janaka, the father of Śītā.
It was this bow which was broken by Śrī Rāma at the
time of Sītā's Svayaṃvara.
<div n="NI"/>After the battle with Śiva, Viṣṇu gave his bow to
Ṛcīka who, in turn gave it to Jamadagni. Jamadagni
presented it to his son Paraśurāma. It was with this
Vaiṣṇavacāpa that Paraśurāma confronted Śrī Rāma
who was returning after Sītā's Svayaṃvara. (Rāmāyaṇa,
Bālakāṇḍa, 75th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Ṛcīka was given 1,000 white horses with black ears
which could run fast, by Gādhi as dowry. Varuṇa
presented these horses on the bank of the river Gaṅgā.
The place in Gaṅgā where the horses rose up, came to
be called “Aśvatīrtha”. Gādhi gave Satyavatī to
Ṛcīka at the place called ‘Kanyākubja’. (M.B. Araṇya
Parva, Chapter 115).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahābhārata, Aśvamedhika Parva, Chapter 29,
Verse 23 says that Ṛcīka once tried to stop Paraśurāma
from killing Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once Dyutimān, King of Sālva, presented a tract
of land to Ṛcīka. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 137,
Verse 28).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Ṛcīka attained Vaikuṇṭha and his wife Satyavatī
accompanied him in her earthly body. It is said that
after it, Satyavatī transformed herself into a river under
the name “Kauśikī” and began to flow in north India.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, 34th Sarga).
