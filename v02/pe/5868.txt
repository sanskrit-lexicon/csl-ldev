ŚABARĪ¦. A woman of the tribe of forest-dwellers. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, during his life in the forest, gave her salvation.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Former life.%} Śabarī, in her former life, was the only
<div n="lb"/>daughter Mālinī of the Gandharva King, Citrakavaca.
<div n="lb"/>An erudite scholar, Vītihotra, married her. As he was
<div n="lb"/>ever immersed in contemplation of Brahman his wife
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī, (later Śabarī) kept one hunter, Kalmāṣa, as
<div n="lb"/>her paramour, and her husband cursed her thus: “As
<div n="lb"/>you have become a lover of the hunter, you turn out
<div n="lb"/>to be a hunter-woman.”
<div n="NI"/>2) {%At the Suburbs of Mataṅga's hermitage.%}
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī in tears sought redemption from the curse from
<div n="lb"/>her husband, and he told her that she would get ab-
<div n="lb"/>solution from her infamy and the curse from Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately she was transformed into a hunter-woman
<div n="lb"/>and she came to the suburbs of Mataṅgāśrama. She took
<div n="lb"/>a special liking for the place, the reason being that the
<div n="lb"/>flowers in the āśrama possessed a special fragrance.
<div n="lb"/>Once while the disciples were carrying a load of
<div n="lb"/>flowers for the muni (Mataṅga) a few drops of sweat
<div n="lb"/>from their bodies fell on the ground, and the muni
<div n="lb"/>blessed that the trees and creepers, which grew up
<div n="lb"/>from the sweat and their flowers would never fade.
<div n="lb"/>This is described as follows in Canto 73, Araṇyakāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>“Oh! Rāma! nobody plucks and wears those flowers.
<div n="lb"/>They neither fade nor fall down. While the disciples of
<div n="lb"/>Mataṅga were carrying a load of flowers for him, they
<div n="lb"/>sweated on account of exhaustion and some drops of
<div n="lb"/>sweat fell on earth which developed themselves into
<div n="lb"/>flowers due to the prowess of the guru's tapas. Even
<div n="lb"/>today may be seen there Śabarī, who has taken to
<div n="lb"/>sannyāsa and who tends the flowers. She will attain
<div n="lb"/>heaven only after seeing you.”
<div n="NI"/>Śabarī lived for long there serving Mataṅga's disciples,
<div n="lb"/>performing tapas and learning knowledge about
<div n="lb"/>Brahman. At the time of the munis giving up their
<div n="lb"/>physical bodies they blessed Śabarī that without further
<div n="lb"/>delay she would meet Rāma and get redemption from
<div n="lb"/>the curse. They also blessed that she would possess
<div n="lb"/>divine eyes to see hidden things and also the past and
<div n="lb"/>the future. After that she was spending her days await-
<div n="lb"/>ing the arrival of Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>It was the period of the life in the forest of Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa. After visiting various āśramas Rāma at
<div n="lb"/>last came to Mataṅgāśrama. Hearing about Rāma's
[Page659-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>visit Śabarī had gathered a lot of fruits. Now, Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa came and Śabarī received them most
<div n="lb"/>respectfully. After herself biting each fruit to test its
<div n="lb"/>taste she gave the fruits for them to eat. The left-overs
<div n="lb"/>of Śabarī appeared as nectar to Rāma. Then Śabarī
<div n="lb"/>told Rāma thus: “When you go a short distance south-
<div n="lb"/>wards there is the beautiful stream called Pampā. You
<div n="lb"/>cross Pampā and advance a little further and you will
<div n="lb"/>reach mount Ṛṣyamūka. On the top of that mountain
<div n="lb"/>lives Sugrīva, son of Sun, and if you enter into alliance
<div n="lb"/>with him you will succeed in finding out and getting
<div n="lb"/>back Sītā after annihilating the enemies. Oh! Lord!
<div n="lb"/>my salutations.”
<div n="NI"/>After speaking thus, Śabarī the great anchorite and
<div n="lb"/>chaste woman closed her eyes. Immediately she was
<div n="lb"/>transformed into Mālinī, the Gandharva damsel, and
<div n="lb"/>all at once a handsome Gandharva prince appeared there
<div n="lb"/>in a divine plane. It was Vītihotra, the husband of
<div n="lb"/>Mālinī. After saluting Śrī Rāma he took away his wife
<div n="lb"/>in a chariot to the Gandharva city. (Kamba Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa).
