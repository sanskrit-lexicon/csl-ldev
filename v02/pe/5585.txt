RĀDHĀ I¦. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's dearest consort. Rādhā is consi-
<div n="lb"/>dered to be one of the two forms of Lakṣmīdevī. When
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa lived in Gokula as a man with two hands
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā was his dearest consort. But when he lives in
<div n="lb"/>Vaikuṇṭha as four-handed Viṣṇu, Lakṣmī is his dearest
[Page625-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>consort. (Devī Bhāgavata 9, 1; Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>2, 49 and 56-57 and Ādi Parva Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>Different versions about the birth of Rādhā are given
<div n="lb"/>in the Purāṇas, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) She was born in Gokula as daughter of Vṛṣabhānu
<div n="lb"/>and Kalāvatī. (Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa, 2, 49; 35-42;
<div n="lb"/>Nārada Purāṇa, 2. 81).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) She was got as Bhūmi-kanyā (earth-girl) when
<div n="lb"/>King Vṛṣabhānu was preparing the ground to conduct
<div n="lb"/>a Yajña. (Padma Purāṇa; Brahma Purāṇa 7).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) She was born from the left side of Kṛṣṇa. (Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>vaivarta Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) At the time of Kṛṣṇa's birth Viṣṇu asked his
<div n="lb"/>attendants to be born on earth. Accordingly Rādhā,
<div n="lb"/>dear consort of Kṛṣṇa, took her birth in Gokula
<div n="lb"/>under the star Jyeṣṭhā in the morning of Śuklāṣṭamī
<div n="lb"/>day in Bhādrapada month. (Ādi Parva 11),
<div n="NI"/>(v) Kṛṣṇa once went with Virajā, the Gopī woman, to
<div n="lb"/>the hall of enjoyment (rāsamaṇḍalam). Knowing about
<div n="lb"/>it Rādhā followed them to the hall, but both of them
<div n="lb"/>were not to be seen. On another occasion when Rādhā
<div n="lb"/>found Virajā in the company of Kṛṣṇa and Sudāmā
<div n="lb"/>she, in great anger, insulted Kṛṣṇa whereupon Sudāmā
<div n="lb"/>cursed her to be born in human womb and experience the
<div n="lb"/>pangs of separation from Kṛṣṇa. (Nārada Purāṇa 2. 8;
<div n="lb"/>Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa. 2. 49) and Rādhā cursed him
<div n="lb"/>in turn to be born in the dānava dynasty. It was on
<div n="lb"/>account of this curse of Rādhā that Sudāmā was born
<div n="lb"/>as the asura called Śaṅkhacūḍa. (Brahma Vaivarta
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, 2. 4. 9. 34).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Rādhā is considered to be one of the five forces
<div n="lb"/>which help Viṣṇu in the process of creation. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata 9. 1; Nārada Purāṇa 2. 81).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Rādhā is the mental power of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (For
<div n="lb"/>details see under Pañcaprāṇas).
