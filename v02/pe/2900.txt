JĀTAKARMĀDISAṂSKĀRA¦(S). In the ancient days
<div n="lb"/>the people of Bhārata observed certain social and
<div n="lb"/>customary rites immediately after the birth of a child.
<div n="lb"/>They were known as Jātakarmans. Each caste had its
<div n="lb"/>own jātakarmans. They are given below:
<div n="NI"/>If it is a male child jātakarman should be done before
<div n="lb"/>cutting the umbilical cord. At that time gold is to be
<div n="lb"/>rubbed in ghee and honey and the tongue of the child
<div n="lb"/>should be touched with it, uttering mantras (spells)
<div n="lb"/>(Colloquial name of this rite is giving gold and honey).
<div n="lb"/>The child should be named on the tenth or twelfth day
<div n="lb"/>after birth, selecting suitable lunar day, good star and
<div n="lb"/>auspicious moment. The name should imply prosperity
<div n="lb"/>to Brāhmans, might to Kṣatriyas, wealth to Vaiśyas
<div n="lb"/>and humility to Śūdras. That is, the word ‘Śarman’
<div n="lb"/>in the case of Brāhmaṇa, ‘Varman’ for Kṣatriyas,
<div n="lb"/>‘Gupta’ for Vaiśyas and ‘Dāsa’ for Śūdras, should be
<div n="lb"/>added to the name. The names given to girls should
<div n="lb"/>be of easy utterance, having clear meaning but not
<div n="lb"/>cruel, very beautiful, charming, and propitious
<div n="lb"/>avoiding long letters as far as possible. Four months
<div n="lb"/>after delivery, the child should be taken out of the
<div n="lb"/>room of confinement to see the Sun. On the sixth
<div n="lb"/>month the rite of ‘Annaprāśa’ (feeding with rice)
<div n="lb"/>should be performed. In accordance with hereditary
<div n="lb"/>customs the two rites mentioned above may be per-
<div n="lb"/>formed at any time after the third month. For
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas the ceremony of ‘Caula’
<div n="lb"/>(tonsure) may be performed at the time of birth or at
<div n="lb"/>the age of three. The ceremony of Upanayana (Investi-
<div n="lb"/>ture with the Brāhma string) should be conducted at
<div n="lb"/>the age of eight from pregnancy for Brāhmaṇas, at the
<div n="lb"/>age of eleven from pregnancy for Kṣatriyas and at the
<div n="lb"/>age of twelve for Vaiśyas. But Upanayana could be
<div n="lb"/>performed at the age of five for Brāhmaṇas who desire
<div n="lb"/>Brāhma-radiance, at the age of six for Kṣatriyas who
<div n="lb"/>desire might and at the age of eight for Vaiśyas who
<div n="lb"/>desire wealth. There is another opinion that Upana-
<div n="lb"/>yana could be performed up to the age of sixteen for
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas and twentytwo for Kṣatriyas. Even after
<div n="lb"/>the attainment of this age, if this ceremony is not
<div n="lb"/>performed, that boy will be considered an out-cast from
<div n="lb"/>the mantra (spell) of Gāyatrī, and will have no
<div n="lb"/>admittance to the rituals and ceremonies performed by
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas and will be known by the name Vrātya
<div n="lb"/>(an outcast, uninvested Brāhmaṇa). These Vrātyas
<div n="lb"/>could not be taught Vedas or be given women as
<div n="lb"/>wives.
<div n="NI"/>Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and Vaiśya brahmacāris (celibates)
<div n="lb"/>could use the hides of black antelope, spotted deer or
<div n="lb"/>goat as upper garment and clothes made of silk thread,
<div n="lb"/>flax or wool of sheep or red leopard. To tie round the
<div n="lb"/>waist, Brāhmaṇas have to make belts out of Muñja
<div n="lb"/>(grass), Kṣatriyas, out of Mūrva (grass) and Vaiśyas
<div n="lb"/>out of flax. When these are not available, Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>may use Kuśa grass, Kṣatriyas ñānal grass and Vaiśyas
<div n="lb"/>Darbha grass called balbaja to make belts of customary
<div n="lb"/>three darns or five darns with a knot. A celibate should
<div n="lb"/>have a stick. For Brāhmaṇas the stick should be made
<div n="lb"/>of Bilva (Aegle marmelos) or “palāśa” (Butea frondosa)
<div n="lb"/>and for Kṣatriyas, of banyan or blackwood. (Mimosa
<div n="lb"/>catechu) and for Vaiśyas, of Dillenia speciosa (Uka
<div n="lb"/>tree) or fig tree. For Brāhmaṇas the stick should
[Page351-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>reach up to the top of the head, for Kṣatriyas up to the
<div n="lb"/>forehead and for Vaiśyas up to the nose. Before going
<div n="lb"/>for alms, the celibate should take his stick, bow before
<div n="lb"/>the sun, go round the fire and only then set out. The
<div n="lb"/>alms received should be offered to the teacher as
<div n="lb"/>oblation, then he should turn to the east and wash hands
<div n="lb"/>and mouth and eat it. Brāhmaṇas should wear
<div n="lb"/>the upper garment or their sacred thread (Yajña-
<div n="lb"/>sūtra) on the left shoulder and under the right arm and
<div n="lb"/>then it is called ‘Upavīta’; if it is on the right shoulder
<div n="lb"/>and under the left arm it is called “Prācīnāvīta” and
<div n="lb"/>if it is round the neck it is called “Nivīta”.
<div n="NI"/>These Jātakarmans may be done for the female child
<div n="lb"/>also at the stipulated times by tantras, without reciting
<div n="lb"/>mantras, for the purification of the body. The rituals
<div n="lb"/>performed without reciting Vedamantras (spells) are
<div n="lb"/>called tantras. For women marriage is to be considered
<div n="lb"/>as Upanayana, looking after the needs of husband to be
<div n="lb"/>considered as learning at the house of the teacher, and
<div n="lb"/>housekeeping as samidādhāna (gathering fuel of Butea
<div n="lb"/>frondosa). (Manusmṛti, Chapter 2).
