ANANTA I¦. (ĀDIŚEṢA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Mahāviṣṇu begot Brahmā and he the
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpatis and Ananta (Ādiśeṣa) is one of the Prajā-
<div n="lb"/>patis. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 14,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 7). Ananta is also referred to as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, one of the Prajāpatis born of Kadrū. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 105, Verse 41). Also Balabhadra-
<div n="lb"/>rāma, elder brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was a partial incarna-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Ananta.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Differences with mother.%} Vinatā and Kadrū were
<div n="lb"/>two wives of Kaśyapa prajāpati. Garuḍa was born as
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā's son and numerous serpents like Ananta, Vāsuki,
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka, Kārkkoṭaka were sons of Kadrū. Once a
<div n="lb"/>controversy developed between Vinatā and Kadrū, the
<div n="lb"/>latter saying that there were a few black hairs on the
<div n="lb"/>tail of Airāvata and the former denying it. It was
<div n="lb"/>agreed that she who proved wrong in the argument
<div n="lb"/>would become the slave of the other. To prove herself
<div n="lb"/>to be right Kadrū, the same night, asked her sons to
<div n="lb"/>go and stay suspended in the hairs of Airāvata's tail.
<div n="lb"/>Some of the sons agreed to do so, while her other
<div n="lb"/>(prominent) sons like Ananta expressed their disincli-
<div n="lb"/>nation to do such an unethical act. Kadrū cursed these
<div n="lb"/>disobedient children of hers to die at the serpent yajña
<div n="lb"/>of Janamejaya, whereupon Ananta and his supporters
<div n="lb"/>departed in sorrow. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ananta's new engagement.%} Departing thus from his
<div n="lb"/>mother Ananta visited sacred centres like Gandha-
<div n="lb"/>mādana, Badarī and practised austerities. And, Brahma
<div n="lb"/>appeared before Ananta and asked him not to worry,
<div n="lb"/>but to go to the nether world and support the world
<div n="lb"/>on his hoods. Brahmā also told him that Garuḍa would
<div n="lb"/>render him all help in the new task. Blessed thus by
[Page035-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Ananta gladly took up the new job. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 24).
<div n="NI"/>4) Ananta has another abode in the palace of Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>in the west. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 110, Verse
<div n="lb"/>18).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ananta's prowess.%} About Ananta's prowess Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa has the following to say: At the bottom of
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla there is a base (Tāmasic) form of Viṣṇu called
<div n="lb"/>Ādiśeṣa. Even the Dānavas and the Daityas are not
<div n="lb"/>able to describe the attributes of that form. The
<div n="lb"/>Siddhas call this Ādiśeṣa Ananta who is worshipped
<div n="lb"/>by Devas and ṛṣis. Ananta has 1000 heads and the
<div n="lb"/>Svastika mark which is clearly visible is his ornament.
<div n="lb"/>The 1000 gems in his head illuminate all regions, and
<div n="lb"/>he renders the Asuras powerless for the good of all the
<div n="lb"/>worlds. Ādiśeṣa whose eyes ever rotate due to the
<div n="lb"/>overflow of his prowess, and who wears blue apparel
<div n="lb"/>and garlands of white gems shines forth like another
<div n="lb"/>Mount Kailāsa beautified with garlands of clouds and
<div n="lb"/>by the flow of the Gaṅgā. Śrī Devī and Vāruṇī Devī serve
<div n="lb"/>Ananta who holds in one hand a lāṃgala and in the
<div n="lb"/>other a mace (mūsala). As the deluge (end of a yuga
<div n="lb"/>Kalpānta) approaches Rudra emanates from the faces
<div n="lb"/>of Ananta and consumes the three worlds. Ādiśeṣa
<div n="lb"/>dwells in the nether world wearing the whole earth as
<div n="lb"/>a crown. Even the Devas cannot gauge his nature, shape,
<div n="lb"/>prowess etc. When he yawns the earth and waters shake
<div n="lb"/>and shiver. The Gandharvas, Nāgas, Cāraṇas etc. fail
<div n="lb"/>to understand the real extent of his attributes, and that
<div n="lb"/>is why this strange being is called Ananta (endless). It
<div n="lb"/>was by worshipping Ananta and by his grace that sage
<div n="lb"/>Garga was able to master the sciences of astronomy
<div n="lb"/>and causation (nimitta). (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 2,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The land of Ananta.%} Pātāla is Ananta's world, and
<div n="lb"/>at its bottom there is a spot called Ananta. That spot
<div n="lb"/>is 30000 yojanas in extent, and here lives Ananta. He is
<div n="lb"/>known as Saṅkarṣaṇa also. He bears the whole nether
<div n="lb"/>world as though it were a mustard seed. And, when
<div n="lb"/>he thinks of destroying the entire world the Rudra
<div n="lb"/>called Saṅkarṣaṇa will appear with other Rudras and
<div n="lb"/>weapons like tridents (Triśūla). Other serpents bow at
<div n="lb"/>the feet of Ananta, who is supremely beautiful with
<div n="lb"/>divine lustre. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
