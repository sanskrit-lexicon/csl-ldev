ANANTA I¦. (ĀDIŚEṢA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Mahāviṣṇu begot Brahmā and he the
Prajāpatis and Ananta (Ādiśeṣa) is one of the Prajā-
patis. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 14,
Verse 7). Ananta is also referred to as the son of
Kaśyapa, one of the Prajāpatis born of Kadrū. (M.B.,
Ādi Parva, Chapter 105, Verse 41). Also Balabhadra-
rāma, elder brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was a partial incarna-
tion of Ananta.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Differences with mother.%} Vinatā and Kadrū were
two wives of Kaśyapa prajāpati. Garuḍa was born as
Vinatā's son and numerous serpents like Ananta, Vāsuki,
Takṣaka, Kārkkoṭaka were sons of Kadrū. Once a
controversy developed between Vinatā and Kadrū, the
latter saying that there were a few black hairs on the
tail of Airāvata and the former denying it. It was
agreed that she who proved wrong in the argument
would become the slave of the other. To prove herself
to be right Kadrū, the same night, asked her sons to
go and stay suspended in the hairs of Airāvata's tail.
Some of the sons agreed to do so, while her other
(prominent) sons like Ananta expressed their disincli-
nation to do such an unethical act. Kadrū cursed these
disobedient children of hers to die at the serpent yajña
of Janamejaya, whereupon Ananta and his supporters
departed in sorrow. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ananta's new engagement.%} Departing thus from his
mother Ananta visited sacred centres like Gandha-
mādana, Badarī and practised austerities. And, Brahma
appeared before Ananta and asked him not to worry,
but to go to the nether world and support the world
on his hoods. Brahmā also told him that Garuḍa would
render him all help in the new task. Blessed thus by
[Page035-a+ 64]
Brahmā, Ananta gladly took up the new job. (M.B.,
Ādi Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 24).
<div n="NI"/>4) Ananta has another abode in the palace of Varuṇa
in the west. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 110, Verse
18).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ananta's prowess.%} About Ananta's prowess Viṣṇu
Purāṇa has the following to say: At the bottom of
Pātāla there is a base (Tāmasic) form of Viṣṇu called
Ādiśeṣa. Even the Dānavas and the Daityas are not
able to describe the attributes of that form. The
Siddhas call this Ādiśeṣa Ananta who is worshipped
by Devas and ṛṣis. Ananta has 1000 heads and the
Svastika mark which is clearly visible is his ornament.
The 1000 gems in his head illuminate all regions, and
he renders the Asuras powerless for the good of all the
worlds. Ādiśeṣa whose eyes ever rotate due to the
overflow of his prowess, and who wears blue apparel
and garlands of white gems shines forth like another
Mount Kailāsa beautified with garlands of clouds and
by the flow of the Gaṅgā. Śrī Devī and Vāruṇī Devī serve
Ananta who holds in one hand a lāṃgala and in the
other a mace (mūsala). As the deluge (end of a yuga
Kalpānta) approaches Rudra emanates from the faces
of Ananta and consumes the three worlds. Ādiśeṣa
dwells in the nether world wearing the whole earth as
a crown. Even the Devas cannot gauge his nature, shape,
prowess etc. When he yawns the earth and waters shake
and shiver. The Gandharvas, Nāgas, Cāraṇas etc. fail
to understand the real extent of his attributes, and that
is why this strange being is called Ananta (endless). It
was by worshipping Ananta and by his grace that sage
Garga was able to master the sciences of astronomy
and causation (nimitta). (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 2,
Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The land of Ananta.%} Pātāla is Ananta's world, and
at its bottom there is a spot called Ananta. That spot
is 30000 yojanas in extent, and here lives Ananta. He is
known as Saṅkarṣaṇa also. He bears the whole nether
world as though it were a mustard seed. And, when
he thinks of destroying the entire world the Rudra
called Saṅkarṣaṇa will appear with other Rudras and
weapons like tridents (Triśūla). Other serpents bow at
the feet of Ananta, who is supremely beautiful with
divine lustre. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
