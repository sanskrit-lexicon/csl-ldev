NIKUMBHA VI¦. Another form of Gaṇapati. The
<div n="lb"/>following story about him in the Nikumbha state is
<div n="lb"/>told in Vāyu Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Suyaśā, wife of Divodāsa used to worship in the
<div n="lb"/>Nikumbha temple of Vārāṇasī for the sake of a child. As
<div n="lb"/>the worship did not yield the desired effect, Divodāsa
<div n="lb"/>smashed the idol in the temple into pieces. Then
<div n="lb"/>Nikumbha cursed that Vārāṇasī should decline. As a
<div n="lb"/>result of the curse the Hehayas like Tālajaṅgha and others
<div n="lb"/>destroyed Vārāṇasī and drove Divodāsa away from
<div n="lb"/>there. At last the Nikumbha temple was rebuilt and
<div n="lb"/>Vārāṇasī became prosperous again.
