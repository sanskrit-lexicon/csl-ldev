SVADHĀDEVĪ¦. Wife of the Manes. There is a story,
as given below, in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, about
the birth of this goddess.
<div n="NI"/>At the beginning of creation Brahmā created seven
groups of Manes of whom four were embodied and
three were lustrous ones. The deities called the Manes
are the Agniṣvāttas, the Barhiṣadas, the Somapās,
Yama, Anala, Soma and Aryaman. The Śrāddhas
(oblations offered to the manes) were stipulated as
the food of these manes. It was ordered that the
Brahmin who does not make offerings to the manes,
will be as mean and despicable as the Brahmin, who
has not learned the Vedas, who has not eaten meals
presented to an idol in temples, and who has not
worshipped Devī (goddess), and that he would not be
eligible to perform any religious ceremonies. Thus
Brahmā meant Śrāddha as food for the manes. But the
portion of the rice balls offered by the Brahmins stipulat-
ed as the food of the manes, seldom reached them. At
last the manes complained to Brahmā. Then Brahmā
created a woman of beauty, youth, knowledge and
power to grant boons, and of good character, from a
portion of pure nature. She was named Svadhā, and
was given to the manes as wife. Then Brahmins were
ordered to give offerings to the manes only with the
spell (Mantra) of Svadhā. When the Brahmins began to
do as they were ordered, the manes also began to get
food, and they became contented.
<div n="NI"/>Two daughters named Menā and Dhāriṇī were born to
the manes by Svadhādevī. It is mentioned in Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 10, that both of the daughters
were expounders of Vedas, full of knowledge and the
seat of all good qualities.
