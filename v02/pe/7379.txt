SVADHĀDEVĪ¦. Wife of the Manes. There is a story,
<div n="lb"/>as given below, in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, about
<div n="lb"/>the birth of this goddess.
<div n="NI"/>At the beginning of creation Brahmā created seven
<div n="lb"/>groups of Manes of whom four were embodied and
<div n="lb"/>three were lustrous ones. The deities called the Manes
<div n="lb"/>are the Agniṣvāttas, the Barhiṣadas, the Somapās,
<div n="lb"/>Yama, Anala, Soma and Aryaman. The Śrāddhas
<div n="lb"/>(oblations offered to the manes) were stipulated as
<div n="lb"/>the food of these manes. It was ordered that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin who does not make offerings to the manes,
<div n="lb"/>will be as mean and despicable as the Brahmin, who
<div n="lb"/>has not learned the Vedas, who has not eaten meals
<div n="lb"/>presented to an idol in temples, and who has not
<div n="lb"/>worshipped Devī (goddess), and that he would not be
<div n="lb"/>eligible to perform any religious ceremonies. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā meant Śrāddha as food for the manes. But the
<div n="lb"/>portion of the rice balls offered by the Brahmins stipulat-
<div n="lb"/>ed as the food of the manes, seldom reached them. At
<div n="lb"/>last the manes complained to Brahmā. Then Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>created a woman of beauty, youth, knowledge and
<div n="lb"/>power to grant boons, and of good character, from a
<div n="lb"/>portion of pure nature. She was named Svadhā, and
<div n="lb"/>was given to the manes as wife. Then Brahmins were
<div n="lb"/>ordered to give offerings to the manes only with the
<div n="lb"/>spell (Mantra) of Svadhā. When the Brahmins began to
<div n="lb"/>do as they were ordered, the manes also began to get
<div n="lb"/>food, and they became contented.
<div n="NI"/>Two daughters named Menā and Dhāriṇī were born to
<div n="lb"/>the manes by Svadhādevī. It is mentioned in Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 10, that both of the daughters
<div n="lb"/>were expounders of Vedas, full of knowledge and the
<div n="lb"/>seat of all good qualities.
