AVINDHYA¦. A giant in whom Rāvaṇa had confidence.
But he held the opinion that Sītā should be returned
to Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>“The aged giant and noble leader Avindhya, who had
earned the confidence of Rāvaṇa, brave, learned and of
good qualities, pleaded with Rāvaṇa and said that
Rāma would exterminate the entire race of the giants
[Page084-a+ 65]
but the wicked Rāvaṇa would not pay heed to his
words.”
<div n="NI"/>(Śrī Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 37,
Stanzas 12 and 13). This aged giant had sent Trijatā
to the Aśoka park to console Sītā. Hear what she says:
“The famous giant leader, the noble aged well-wisher
of Rāma, Avindhya, had told me about you.”
<div n="NI"/>“(M.B., Araṇya Parva, Stanza 56). There is a situa-
tion in Vana Parva when this noble giant prevented
Rāvaṇa from his attempt to kill Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>“When he saw the decision of Rāvaṇa to kill Sītā,
Avandhya pacified Rāvaṇa” and said, “you, a great King
of a great kingdom should not deteriorate to the level
of killing a woman. A woman who is in prison and at
your disposal is as good as dead. But in my opinion, even
if you cut her body into pieces she would not die and
if she must die you will have to kill her husband.”
(M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chapter 289, Stanzas 28 to 30).
<div n="NI"/>From this statement the wonderful intelligence of
Avindhya could be understood. It is seen in stanzas 6
and 7 of Chapter 291 of M.B., Vana Parva that it was
Avindhya who had taken Sītā before Śrī Rāma when
he had captured Laṅkā.
