RĀKṢASAYAJÑA¦ (RĀKṢASASATRA). Parāśara
Muni once conducted a yajña to annihilate the Rākṣasas
altogether. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 180). The provocation
for Parāśara to conduct the yajña was that a Rākṣasa
called Kalmāṣapāda ate Śakti, the father of the muni
and the son of Vasiṣṭha. When the yajña had reached
its climax Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu went to Parāśara
and held conciliatory talks with him, and Parāśara,
ended the yajña. The Agni that he had made to devour
the Rākṣasas was discarded on the slopes of the Himā-
layas. According to the Purāṇas that fire, even to this
day, continues consuming the Rākṣasas, trees and rocks.
(For details see under Kalmāṣapāda and Parāśara).
