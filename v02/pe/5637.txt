RĀKṢASAYAJÑA¦ (RĀKṢASASATRA). Parāśara
<div n="lb"/>Muni once conducted a yajña to annihilate the Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>altogether. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 180). The provocation
<div n="lb"/>for Parāśara to conduct the yajña was that a Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>called Kalmāṣapāda ate Śakti, the father of the muni
<div n="lb"/>and the son of Vasiṣṭha. When the yajña had reached
<div n="lb"/>its climax Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu went to Parāśara
<div n="lb"/>and held conciliatory talks with him, and Parāśara,
<div n="lb"/>ended the yajña. The Agni that he had made to devour
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasas was discarded on the slopes of the Himā-
<div n="lb"/>layas. According to the Purāṇas that fire, even to this
<div n="lb"/>day, continues consuming the Rākṣasas, trees and rocks.
<div n="lb"/>(For details see under Kalmāṣapāda and Parāśara).
