GHAṆṬĀKARṆA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Ghaṇṭa and Karṇa were two Rākṣasa bro-
thers who attained salvation by worshipping Viṣṇu.
(Bhāgavata, daśama Skandha). But the elder brother,
Ghaṇṭa alone is sometimes called by the name Ghaṇṭā-
karṇa in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} There is a reference in Dārukavadha (killing
of Dārukāsura) about the birth of Ghaṇṭākaṛṇa.
Dāruka, after having secured a boon from Brahmā, used
to harass the world too much and when his depre-
dation became unbearable Śiva created Bhadrakālī
from his third eye and she killed the asura. Mandodarī
wife of Dāruka and daughter of Maya was sunk in
grief at the death of her husband. She began to do
tapas. Śiva appeared and gave her a few drops of sweat
from his body saying that the person on whom she
sprinkled the sweat drops would suffer from small-pox
and that such patients would worship her (Mandodarī)
and supply her necessary food. From that day onwards
Mandodarī became the presiding deity over small-pox.
On her way back to the earth with the sweat-drops
Mandodarī met Bhadrakālī at whom she threw the sweat-
drops to take revenge for her husband's death. Immedi-
ately Bhadrakālī fell down with an attack of small-pox.
Hearing about the mishap Śiva created a terrible
Rākṣasa called Ghaṇṭākarṇa. According to Śiva's
directions Ghaṇṭākarṇa licked off the small-pox from
Bhadrakālī's body. But, when he tried to lick it off from
her face she prevented him saying that she and Ghaṇṭā-
karṇa were sister and brother and that it was improper
for the brother to lick the face of the sister. And, even
to this day the small-pox on Bhadrakālī's face remains
as an ornament to her.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The name Ghaṇṭākarṇa.%} This Rākṣasa, at first, was
an enemy of Viṣṇu, and did not tolerate even the men-
tion of Viṣṇu's name. Therefore, he went about always
wearing a bell so that the tinkling of it warded off the
name of Viṣṇu from entering his ears. Because he wore
a ghaṇṭā (bell) in his Karṇas (ears) he came to be
known as Ghaṇṭākarṇa. (M.B. Bhaviṣya Parva, Chap-
ter 80).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Turned out to be a devotee of Viṣṇu.%} Ghaṇṭākarṇa
became a servant of Kubera. Once he did tapas for
salvation. Śiva appeared and asked him to do tapas to
please Viṣṇu as Viṣṇu was greater than himself (Śiva).
From that day onwards he removed the bells from his
ears and became a devotee of Viṣṇu. (Bhaviṣya Parva,
Chapter 80).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Attained salvation.%} Handing over charge of govern-
ment to Sātyaki Śrī Kṛṣṇa once went to Kailāsa moun-
ted on Garuḍa to see Śiva. On his way he dismounted
at the Badaryāśrama, and while sitting deep in medi-
tation there he heard the thundering voice of Piśācas
(souls of dead people roaming about without attaining
salvation). He also heard the barking of dogs, and thus
he understood that Piśācas were hunting animals. The
hunters came to Kṛṣṇa's presence. They were led by
Ghaṇṭākarṇa who was reciting the name of Viṣṇu. Śrī
[Page289-b+ 64]
Kṛṣṇa felt pity for him. Ghaṇṭākarṇa told Kṛṣṇa that
his aim and ambition were to see Viṣṇu and that Śiva
had blessed that he would realise his ambition at
Badaryāśrama. Pleased at all this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa revealed
his Viśvarūpa (representing in his person the whole
universe), and at once Ghaṇṭākarṇa brought half of the
corpse of a brahmin and submitted it as a present
before the Lord. He explained to Kṛṣṇa that according
to the custom of the Rākṣasas that was the best present
which could be made. Without accepting the present
Kṛṣṇa patted Ghaṇṭākarṇa on his back with the result
that he cast off his body and rose up to Vaikuṇṭha.
(Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Chapters 80-82 and also Bhāgavata,
Daśama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Ghaṇṭākarṇa Pratiṣṭhā.%} (Installation of his idol in
temples). Though Ghaṇṭākarṇa was a Rākṣasa, as he
attained Vaikuṇṭha due to the blessings of God Al-
mighty his idol is still installed in temples and wor-
shipped. The installation ceremony is described in
Chapter 59 of the Agni Purāṇa thus: “Ghaṇṭākarṇa
should have 18 hands. He cures diseases born as a result
of sins. He holds in his right hand Vajra, sword,
Cakra, arrow etc. And in his left hand broom, sword, cord
bell, pickaxe etc. He also holds the triśūla (trident).
<div n="NI"/>Ghaṇṭākarṇa who turned out to be a Deva is believed
to cure small-pox.
