AMĀVASU II¦. One of the Pitṛs. Once Acchodā was
fascinated by the physical charm of this Amāvasu and
made advances of love to him. Amāvasu repelled her
advances. On account of this impropriety of Acchodā,
who was a spiritual daughter of the Pitṛs, she was de-
graded and in her next birth was born as Kālī or
Satyavatī. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa).
