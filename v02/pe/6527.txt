SAVANA¦. I.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Son of Priyavrata who was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva Manu, by his wife, Surūpā. Surūpā had
<div n="lb"/>ten sons including Savana. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha
<div n="lb"/>8).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of son.%} Savana married Suvedā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Sunābha; but he expired before children were born to
<div n="lb"/>him. According to the Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 72,
<div n="lb"/>seven children were born from the dead Savana. The
<div n="lb"/>story about it is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Suvedā, heart-broken at the death of Savana, did not
<div n="lb"/>permit the dead body to be burnt, herself holding it in
<div n="lb"/>embrace. Then a celestial voice said to her: “Cry
<div n="lb"/>not. If you are really chaste and true, enter the
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre along with your husband.” To this Suvedā
<div n="lb"/>answered thus: “I cry because of grief that he died
<div n="lb"/>before making me the mother of a son.” The celestial
<div n="lb"/>voice said to her again: “You enter the pyre without
<div n="lb"/>weeping. Your husband will have seven sons.”
<div n="NI"/>Sudevā now permitted her dead husband to be cremat-
<div n="lb"/>ed and meditating upon her chastity she jumped into
<div n="lb"/>the funeral pyre. But within minutes Savana came
<div n="lb"/>alive out of the fire with his wife and rose to the sky
<div n="lb"/>with her. He stayed in the sky for another five days
<div n="lb"/>and on the sixth day had the sexual act again with
<div n="lb"/>her. His semen dropped on earth from the sky. The
<div n="lb"/>King then with his wife went to Brahmaloka.
<div n="NI"/>Samādā, Nalinī, Puṣyati, Citrā, Viśālā, Haritā and
<div n="lb"/>Alinīlā, all of them wives of munis saw the semen in
<div n="lb"/>the sky and when it fell into the water they thought it
<div n="lb"/>was amṛta, which conferred eternal youth, and with
<div n="lb"/>the permission of their husbands swallowed it. As soon
<div n="lb"/>as they swallowed it their divine effulgence was dimi-
<div n="lb"/>nished and their husbands, therefore, abandoned them.
<div n="lb"/>Those women delivered seven children, who cried
<div n="lb"/>fiercely and that sound filled the entire universe. Then
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā appeared and asked the children not to cry and
<div n="lb"/>also told them that they would come to be called
<div n="lb"/>Maruts. Brahmā himself called them Maruts. They
<div n="lb"/>were the Maruts of the first Svāyambhuva Manuvantara.
