SUBHADRĀ I¦. Sister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Subhadrā was the daughter of Vasudeva by
his wife Devakī. She had two brothers, Kṛṣṇa and
Sāraṇa and she was her father's pet child. (Ādi Parva,
Chapter 217, Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Married to Arjuna.%} During his one year's pilgrimage
Arjuna, after visiting various holy places, came at last
to Prabhāsa tīrtha in the plains of the western moun-
tain. He met Gada there who described to him the
unique beauty of Subhadrā. The description evoked
in him the desire to marry her for which purpose he
assumed the form of a Sannyāsin and sitting under a
tree thought about Śrī Kṛṣṇa who understood the fact
while lying on the bed with Satyabhāmā and immedia-
tely he began laughing. Asked for the reason for his
laughing thus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa told her about Arjuna think-
ing about him etc. Kṛṣṇa then went to Arjuna and
questioned him about the reason for his pilgrimage and
the latter explained the circumstances of it. They then
went to the Raivata mountain where Arjuna revealed
to Kṛṣṇa his desire to marry Subhadrā. Kṛṣṇa agreed
and, after leaving Arjuna at the mountain, returned to
Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>Within a few days the Yādavas celebrated a festival at
Raivata attended by prominent leaders like Balabhadra,
Ugrasena, Pradyumna, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and others. The sight
of Subhadrā among them evoked uncontrollable love in
Arjuna who asked Kṛṣṇa secretly about the means for him
to marry Subhadrā. Kṛṣṇa answered him thus: “Svayaṃ-
vara (marriage by self choice by a woman) is ordained
for Kṣatriyas. But, how would we know whom Subhadrā
loves. Abduction also is ordained for Kṣatriyas. So
you abduct Subhadrā.”
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna immediately sent word about the matter through
emissaries to Indraprastha. After the festival at Raivata
was over, Subhadrā returned to Dvārakā. As for Arjuna,
he sat on a rock in the forest thinking about Subhadrā
when Yādava heroes like Bala, Sāmba, Sāraṇa, Pradyu-
mna and Gada came that way by chance. They saluted
the Sannyāsin (Arjuna) and after blessing them he made
them sit on the rock around him and related to them
various stories. Then Yādavas felt great respect for the
Sannyāsin and invited him and took him to Dvārakā.
Kṛṣṇa and others arranged for the stay of the Sannyāsin,
who pretended to spend Cāturmāsya there. He was to
be fed from Subhadrā's house and the Sannyāsin was
overwhelmed with joy.
<div n="NI"/>As days passed on thus, Arjuna grew more and more
sick with love. Subhadrā felt unbounded affection for
him. She heard from him many stories about the valiant
Pāṇḍava, Arjuna. When he was convinced that Subhadrā
cherished strong love for him, Arjuna revealed the truth
about him. When he told her that he, the fake Sannyāsin,
was really Arjuna who was living there without the
knowledge of his mother and brothers, Subhadrā bent
down her head in shyness.
<div n="NI"/>Subhadrā's wedding was decided to be held on the
twelfth day from that date. Balabhadra and Uddhava
both of them short-tempered, were not informed about
the decision. Śrī Kṛṣṇa took the lead in making prepar-
ations for the wedding and he saw Subhadrā and gave
her all good wishes.
[Page746-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Many of the Yādava chiefs wanted Subhadrā to be
wedded to Duryodhana, a disciple of Balabhadra and
against this desire of theirs Subhadrā and Arjuna to-
gether drove themselves away in a chariot through lines
of people and this created a stir among the Yādavas.
But, Kṛṣṇa pacified them all. (Ādi Parva, Chapters
213-228; Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
