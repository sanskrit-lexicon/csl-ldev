ĀŚRAMA¦. Asramites (Inmates of an Āśrama) have to pass
<div n="lb"/>through four stages. The four stages of Brahmacarya,
<div n="lb"/>Gārhasthya, Vānaprastha and Sannyāsa are known as
<div n="lb"/>the four Āśramas. Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 9
<div n="lb"/>describes each of the Āśramas as follows:
<div n="NI"/>1. {%Brahmacarya.%} “After Upanayana a boy should
<div n="lb"/>maintain a Brahmacārī's vrata, engage himself in the
<div n="lb"/>study of the Vedas, suppress his indriyas (the five
<div n="lb"/>senses) and live in the house of the preceptor. Living
<div n="lb"/>there with proper observance of śauca, customs and
<div n="lb"/>vratas he should serve and attend on the Guru. The
<div n="lb"/>study of Vedas should be with proper observance of
<div n="lb"/>Vratas and steady attention. A Brahmacārī should
<div n="lb"/>worship with concentration, the Sun and Agni at the
<div n="lb"/>time of the two sandhyās (dawn and dusk) and after
<div n="lb"/>that he should do obeisance to the Guru. When the Guru
<div n="lb"/>stands, he should also be standing. When the guru walks,
<div n="lb"/>he should walk behind him and when he sits, he should
<div n="lb"/>sit in a lower position. The Śiṣya (disciple-pupil) should
<div n="lb"/>not do anything against the guru. When the guru him-
<div n="lb"/>self asks, the Śiṣya should sit in front of him and recite
<div n="lb"/>Vedas without attending to anything else. After that,
<div n="lb"/>with his permission he may eat food which has been
<div n="lb"/>got by begging. The Śiṣya may take his bath in the
<div n="lb"/>water only after the Ācārya (guru) has taken his bath
<div n="lb"/>in it. Everyday the Camata, darbha, water and flowers
<div n="lb"/>which the guru needs, must be brought and supplied
<div n="lb"/>(by the Śiṣya).
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Gārhasthya.%} After the study of the Vedas the intelli-
<div n="lb"/>gent śiṣya gives Gurudakṣiṇā (Payment to the precep-
<div n="lb"/>tor) and with the consent of the Guru, enters into
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhasthāśrama. Then he is to marry and by earning
<div n="lb"/>money from a suitable occupation, should fulfil all
<div n="lb"/>obligations of a Gṛhastha according to his capacity.
<div n="lb"/>The Gṛhastha who worships the Pitṛs with Piṇḍadāna
<div n="lb"/>(offerings of rice balls), Devas with Yāgas (sacrifices),
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣis with Svādhyāya (self discipline), Prajāpatis with
<div n="lb"/>begetting of children, spirits with bali (offering of food
<div n="lb"/>etc.) and the whole world with love, attains the holy
<div n="lb"/>world by his own virtuous deeds. Gṛhasthāśrama is the
<div n="lb"/>only source of support for sannyāsīs and brahmacārīs
<div n="lb"/>who beg their food. Therefore feeding them is an act
<div n="lb"/>of nobility. Brāhmaṇas travel from country to country
[Page093-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to study Vedas, for pilgrimage and for seeing the places.
<div n="lb"/>The Gṛhastha is the only refuge and support of those
<div n="lb"/>who are homeless, who do not carry their food with
<div n="lb"/>them and those who spend the night wherever they
<div n="lb"/>reach. If such people come to his house, the Gṛhastha
<div n="lb"/>should welcome them with kind and loving words, and
<div n="lb"/>give them bed, seat and food. The guest who leaves a
<div n="lb"/>house disappointed, is really departing after transfer-
<div n="lb"/>ring his own sins to that householder and taking away
<div n="lb"/>all the virtuous deeds of the householder. It is not
<div n="lb"/>proper for the Gṛhastha to treat a guest with disrespect,
<div n="lb"/>to behave rudely or treacherously towards him, to regret
<div n="lb"/>what has been given to the guest, or to obstruct or
<div n="lb"/>rebuke him. The Gṛhastha who performs the supreme
<div n="lb"/>duty of Gṛhasthāśrama in this way properly, is liberated
<div n="lb"/>from all secular bonds and reaches the noblest worlds.
<div n="NI"/>3. {%Vānaprastha.%} After having finished all his duties in
<div n="lb"/>this way, to his satisfaction, the Gṛhastha, with the
<div n="lb"/>commencement of old age, should go to the forest, either
<div n="lb"/>after entrusting his wife to his sons or taking her also
<div n="lb"/>with him. There, he should use leaves, roots and fruits
<div n="lb"/>for his food, grow hair and beard, sleep on the bare
<div n="lb"/>ground, lead the life of a tāpasa and receive and honour
<div n="lb"/>all classes of guests. His clothes, sheets and blankets
<div n="lb"/>should be of deer-skin and darbha grass. The rule is
<div n="lb"/>that he should bathe three times a day. Worship of gods,
<div n="lb"/>performing homas, hospitality to all guests, mendicancy
<div n="lb"/>-all these are the laudable features of Vānaprastha.
<div n="lb"/>Any oil that is available in the forest is to be used for
<div n="lb"/>his oil bath. Enduring heat and cold, performing tapas,
<div n="lb"/>are also his duties. The Muni who observes this rule in
<div n="lb"/>Vānaprastha with due austerity, burns up all his evils as
<div n="lb"/>with fire and attains the eternal worlds.
<div n="NI"/>4. {%Sannyāsa.%} The fourth Āśrama is that of the Sannyāsī.
<div n="lb"/>Before entering upon the fourth Āśrama one has to
<div n="lb"/>renounce the love of travel, wealth and wife and also
<div n="lb"/>give up all spirit of rivalry. One who embraces sann-
<div n="lb"/>yāsa should abandon completely the efforts for the
<div n="lb"/>three Puruṣārthas of Dharma, Artha and Kāma, treat
<div n="lb"/>friends and foes alike and continue to love all living
<div n="lb"/>beings. Not even a single creature should be offended
<div n="lb"/>by thought, word or deed. Conquering all passions,
<div n="lb"/>the Sannyāsī should renounce all bonds and attach-
<div n="lb"/>ments. He should not stay in a village more than one
<div n="lb"/>night and in a town more than five nights. Even that
<div n="lb"/>should be in such a way that no one feels any love or
<div n="lb"/>hatred towards him. For sustaining life, he should go
<div n="lb"/>about begging food from the houses of the people of
<div n="lb"/>the three castes—Brahmins, Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas. It
<div n="lb"/>should be after all people have taken their food and
<div n="lb"/>put out the cooking fire. The Sannyāsī should cast
<div n="lb"/>away all vices like Kāma, Krodha, Garva, Lobha, and
<div n="lb"/>Moha and should not have any thought of self in any-
<div n="lb"/>thing. The Muni who goes about giving shelter to all
<div n="lb"/>creatures will not have to fear any creature. The
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa who follows the Sannyāsāśrama as described
<div n="lb"/>above with a pure heart and without difficulty will
<div n="lb"/>shine like fire without fuel and attain Brahmaloka in
<div n="lb"/>peace.
