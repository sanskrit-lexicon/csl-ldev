JANAKA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Janaka was descended from Viṣṇu in the
<div n="lb"/>following order:—Brahmā,—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivas-
<div n="lb"/>vān—Vaivasvata—Ikṣvāku—Nimi—Mithi—Udāvasu—
<div n="lb"/>Nandivardhana—Suketu—Devarāta—Bṛhadratha—
<div n="lb"/>Mahāvīra—Sudhṛti—Dhṛṣṭaketu—Haryaśva—Maru—
<div n="lb"/>Pratvantaka—Kīrtiratha—Devamīḍha—Vibudha—
<div n="lb"/>Mahīdhraka—Kīrtirāta—Mahāroman—Svarṇaroman—
<div n="lb"/>Hrasvaroman—Sīradhvaja (Janaka).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Janaka dynasty.%} Daṇḍa, Vikukṣi and Nimi were the
<div n="lb"/>three prominent sons of Ikṣvāku. The dynasty of Viku-
<div n="lb"/>kṣi earned reputation as the cradle of such powerful
<div n="lb"/>Kings as Vikukṣi, Kratha, Māndhatā. Triśaṅku. Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra, Sagara and Bhagīratha. Śrī Rāma also was
<div n="lb"/>born in Vikukṣi's dynasty. It was Nimi, the younger
<div n="lb"/>brother of Vikukṣi who founded the Videha dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>There is a story about that dynasty getting the name,
<div n="lb"/>Videha. Nimi decided to conduct a yajña and requested
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha to act as high priest at the yajña. Vaṣiṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>who then was busy with the affairs of another yajña
<div n="lb"/>asked Nimi to postpone his proposed yajña to a later
<div n="lb"/>date. To this Nimi made no answer, and Vasiṣṭha went
<div n="lb"/>away under the impression that his suggestion had been
<div n="lb"/>accepted by Nimi. Accordingly, as soon as he got free
<div n="lb"/>from other preoccupations Vasiṣṭha went to Nimi to
<div n="lb"/>conduct his yajña. But, Nimi had already performed
<div n="lb"/>the Yajña with Gautama as high priest. Enraged at this
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha cursed Nimi that he should lose his body and
<div n="lb"/>become Videha (without body). As the result of the
<div n="lb"/>curse Nimi fell down dead. As Nimi had no sons living
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛṣis churned out of his body a child. As the child
<div n="lb"/>was got by mathana (churning) he was named Mithi
<div n="lb"/>Janaka. After that all kings born in Mithi's dynasty
<div n="lb"/>began using the common name Janaka.
<div n="NI"/>The actual name of Janaka, father of Sītā, was Śīra-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja. Mithilā or Mithilāpurī was the city founded by
<div n="lb"/>Mithi. From the time of the curse pronounced on Nimi
<div n="lb"/>the Kings of that dynasty also came to be known as
<div n="lb"/>Videhas, and the country they ruled Videha. (See
<div n="lb"/>Nimi). (Devī Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brother of Sīradhvaja.%} Sīradhvaja, the father of Sītā
<div n="lb"/>had a brother called Kuśadhvaja. While Śīradhvaja
<div n="lb"/>was the King of Mithilā the King of Sāṃkāśya called
<div n="lb"/>Sudhanvan attacked Mithilā. Sīradhvaja killed Sudhan-
[Page344-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>van in the war and crowned his brother Kuśadhvaja as
<div n="lb"/>the King of Sāṃkāśya. Lakṣmaṇa's wife Ūrmilā was
<div n="lb"/>Kuśadhvaja's daughter. Kuśadhvaja had three daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ters called Māṇḍavī, Ūrmilā and Śrutakīrti. Bharata
<div n="lb"/>married Māṇḍavī and Śatrughna married Śrutakīrti.
<div n="lb"/>(Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Bālakānda, Canto 71).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Sītā%} At a time when Sīradhvaja had no
<div n="lb"/>issues a girl emerged from the furrows of the ploughed
<div n="lb"/>earth, and Sīradhvaja felt the desire to bring up the
<div n="lb"/>child as his own daughter. And, a celestial voice, “Oh!
<div n="lb"/>Sīradhvaja! it is your own daughter” clinched the issue
<div n="lb"/>for the King. That daughter was Sītā. Sīradhvaja—
<div n="lb"/>Janaka—accordingly brought up Sītā as his own dau-
<div n="lb"/>ghter. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Cantol 18).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Janaka got Śaivacāpa. See%} under Jamadagni
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Janaka and Kahoṭaka. See%} under Aṣṭāvakra.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Janaka and Aṣṭāvakra. See%} under Aṣṭāvakra.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Janaka in Yamaloka.%} King Janaka once, by his yogic
<div n="lb"/>powers cast off his physical body. A vimāna (aerial
<div n="lb"/>chariot) from Devaloka arrived to carry Janaka's soul
<div n="lb"/>there. On his way to Devaloka Janaka approached
<div n="lb"/>Kālapurī where innumerable sinners were being tortur-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the various hells. When they breathed the air
<div n="lb"/>which had come in contact with Janaka's body, they
<div n="lb"/>got much relief from their tortures and the fire of hell
<div n="lb"/>now became cool and pleasing to them. When Janaka
<div n="lb"/>was about to go away the inmates of hell begged him not
<div n="lb"/>to leave them in that condition. He thought to himself
<div n="lb"/>thus: “If these beings get some comfort or happiness
<div n="lb"/>from my presence I shall surely stay here in Kālapurī,
<div n="lb"/>which will be my svarga (heaven).” Thinking thus,
<div n="lb"/>Janaka the most righteous of souls stopped there.
<div n="NI"/>And then Kāla arrived there to determine suitable
<div n="lb"/>punishments to the various kinds of sinners, and seeing
<div n="lb"/>Janaka there, asked why he, the most virtuous and the
<div n="lb"/>purest of souls, waited there, Janaka explained his reason
<div n="lb"/>for standing there and added that he would quit the
<div n="lb"/>place only if Kāla released all those people from hell.
<div n="lb"/>On hearing Janaka's answer Kāla pointed out to him one
<div n="lb"/>by one the sinners who were being tortured in hell
<div n="lb"/>and explained things as follows:—“Look here, that
<div n="lb"/>fellow there had seduced the wife of his most intimate
<div n="lb"/>friend, and that is why he is tied to a red hot iron bar
<div n="lb"/>for 10,000 years. After those 10,000 years he would be
<div n="lb"/>born in a pig's womb, and when he is born among
<div n="lb"/>human beings it would be as a eunuch. The other fellow
<div n="lb"/>there forcibly kissed another man's wife, and so he has
<div n="lb"/>to be roasted in Raurava hell for hundred years. That
<div n="lb"/>other fellow is put into this vessel filled with blood and
<div n="lb"/>pus with both his hands cut off as he had stolen other
<div n="lb"/>people's property. This fellow did not speak even a
<div n="lb"/>word of welcome to a tired and hungry man who sought
<div n="lb"/>his hospitality at night. That is why he has been thrown
<div n="lb"/>into thick darkness, and there, for a hundred years, he
<div n="lb"/>must undergo the additional suffering of wasp-bite. As
<div n="lb"/>for this man he had in a loud voice found fault with
<div n="lb"/>another man, and this other fellow is his friend who
<div n="lb"/>listened to those vilifications attentively. And, that is
<div n="lb"/>the reason why both of them have been pushed into
<div n="lb"/>this unused well. So, all these people have to suffer for
<div n="lb"/>their sins. You, King Janaka, who did only righteous
<div n="lb"/>acts will please go away from this accursed place.”
<div n="NI"/>Janaka asked Kāla how those sinners could be released
<div n="lb"/>from hell, and Kāla answered that if any good act of
[Page345-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the King was transferred to them they could be set
<div n="lb"/>free. One early morning Janaka had, with a pure
<div n="lb"/>heart, chanted “Rāma, Rāma” and that good act was
<div n="lb"/>exchanged for the freedom of the sinners.
<div n="NI"/>After their release had been effected, Janaka asked
<div n="lb"/>Kāla: “You say that only sinners come here. What sin
<div n="lb"/>have I committed that I should come here?” Kāla's
<div n="lb"/>reply to the question was as follows:—“Oh! King,
<div n="lb"/>no one else in the whole world has so much puṇya as
<div n="lb"/>you have got. But, a small sin you have committed.
<div n="lb"/>Once you prevented a cow from eating grass, and,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, you had to come up to the gates of hell. Now,
<div n="lb"/>that sin has been atoned for. So you may go to svarga.”
<div n="lb"/>Janaka saluted Kāla and in the divine vimāna went to
<div n="lb"/>Heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapters 30 and 31).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Artificial Janaka.%} While Sītā was a captive in Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, to bring her round, deputed a very clever
<div n="lb"/>magician called Marutta to her, disguised as Janaka,
<div n="lb"/>her father. And Marutta, in the capacity of her father
<div n="lb"/>consoled her and advised her to yield to the wishes of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. But Sītā did not yield, and the artificial Janaka
<div n="lb"/>assumed his original form of Marutta and went away.
<div n="lb"/>(Kaṃba Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Other information about Janaka.%} (1) Bhīmasena

<div n="lb"/>pieces of advice to Janaka. (See under Aśmakopākhyāna).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Once in a war between Janaka and a king called
<div n="lb"/>Pratardana, the army of Janaka, in the presence of the
<div n="lb"/>army of Pratardana stood aghast, and Janaka incited
<div n="lb"/>them to fight by showing heaven and hell to them.
<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 99, Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Once in a war with a King called Kṣemadarśī
<div n="lb"/>when victory for Janaka was found to be an impossibi-
<div n="lb"/>lity he, as advised by Sage Kālakavṛkṣaka gave his
<div n="lb"/>daughter to Kṣemadarśī in marriage. (Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 106, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Once Māṇḍavya a great sage put many questions
<div n="lb"/>about Tṛṣṇā (desire) to Janaka and he, the great
<div n="lb"/>philosopher answered the questions quite satisfactorily
<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 276).
<div n="NI"/>(8) On another occasion Janaka had a talk with Sage
<div n="lb"/>Parāśara about the attainment of prosperity and wel-
<div n="lb"/>fare. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 296).

<div n="lb"/>wanted to test the King. By her yogic powers she
<div n="lb"/>assumed the form of a very beautiful woman and visited
<div n="lb"/>Janaka's palace. She was offered a seat by the King,
<div n="lb"/>and seated on the stool she took her soul into the
<div n="lb"/>body of Janaka, and the soul entered into a discussion
<div n="lb"/>on philosophic subjects with Janaka. Sulabhā was thus
<div n="lb"/>convinced about the unique scholarship of the King
<div n="lb"/>and left the palace ashamed about her attempt to
<div n="lb"/>test the King. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 320).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Śuka, the son of Vyāsa not being fully satisfied by
<div n="lb"/>the study of Bhāgavata once visited Janaka at the
<div n="lb"/>instance of his (Śuka's) father, and Janaka did so
