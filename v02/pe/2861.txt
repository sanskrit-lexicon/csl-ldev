<div n="NI"/>2) {%Janaka dynasty.%} Daṇḍa, Vikukṣi and Nimi were the
three prominent sons of Ikṣvāku. The dynasty of Viku-
kṣi earned reputation as the cradle of such powerful
Kings as Vikukṣi, Kratha, Māndhatā. Triśaṅku. Hariś-
candra, Sagara and Bhagīratha. Śrī Rāma also was
born in Vikukṣi's dynasty. It was Nimi, the younger
brother of Vikukṣi who founded the Videha dynasty.
There is a story about that dynasty getting the name,
Videha. Nimi decided to conduct a yajña and requested
Vasiṣṭha to act as high priest at the yajña. Vaṣiṣṭha,
who then was busy with the affairs of another yajña
asked Nimi to postpone his proposed yajña to a later
date. To this Nimi made no answer, and Vasiṣṭha went
away under the impression that his suggestion had been
accepted by Nimi. Accordingly, as soon as he got free
from other preoccupations Vasiṣṭha went to Nimi to
conduct his yajña. But, Nimi had already performed
the Yajña with Gautama as high priest. Enraged at this
Vasiṣṭha cursed Nimi that he should lose his body and
become Videha (without body). As the result of the
curse Nimi fell down dead. As Nimi had no sons living
the Ṛṣis churned out of his body a child. As the child
was got by mathana (churning) he was named Mithi
Janaka. After that all kings born in Mithi's dynasty
began using the common name Janaka.
<div n="NI"/>The actual name of Janaka, father of Sītā, was Śīra-
dhvaja. Mithilā or Mithilāpurī was the city founded by
Mithi. From the time of the curse pronounced on Nimi
the Kings of that dynasty also came to be known as
Videhas, and the country they ruled Videha. (See
Nimi). (Devī Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brother of Sīradhvaja.%} Sīradhvaja, the father of Sītā
had a brother called Kuśadhvaja. While Śīradhvaja
was the King of Mithilā the King of Sāṃkāśya called
Sudhanvan attacked Mithilā. Sīradhvaja killed Sudhan-
[Page344-b+ 65]
van in the war and crowned his brother Kuśadhvaja as
the King of Sāṃkāśya. Lakṣmaṇa's wife Ūrmilā was
Kuśadhvaja's daughter. Kuśadhvaja had three daugh-
ters called Māṇḍavī, Ūrmilā and Śrutakīrti. Bharata
married Māṇḍavī and Śatrughna married Śrutakīrti.
(Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
Bālakānda, Canto 71).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Sītā%} At a time when Sīradhvaja had no
issues a girl emerged from the furrows of the ploughed
earth, and Sīradhvaja felt the desire to bring up the
child as his own daughter. And, a celestial voice, “Oh!
Sīradhvaja! it is your own daughter” clinched the issue
for the King. That daughter was Sītā. Sīradhvaja—
Janaka—accordingly brought up Sītā as his own dau-
ghter. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Cantol 18).

<div n="NI"/>7) {%Janaka and Aṣṭāvakra. See%} under Aṣṭāvakra.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Janaka in Yamaloka.%} King Janaka once, by his yogic
powers cast off his physical body. A vimāna (aerial
chariot) from Devaloka arrived to carry Janaka's soul
there. On his way to Devaloka Janaka approached
Kālapurī where innumerable sinners were being tortur-
ed in the various hells. When they breathed the air
which had come in contact with Janaka's body, they
got much relief from their tortures and the fire of hell
now became cool and pleasing to them. When Janaka
was about to go away the inmates of hell begged him not
to leave them in that condition. He thought to himself
thus: “If these beings get some comfort or happiness
from my presence I shall surely stay here in Kālapurī,
which will be my svarga (heaven).” Thinking thus,
Janaka the most righteous of souls stopped there.
<div n="NI"/>And then Kāla arrived there to determine suitable
punishments to the various kinds of sinners, and seeing
Janaka there, asked why he, the most virtuous and the
purest of souls, waited there, Janaka explained his reason
for standing there and added that he would quit the
place only if Kāla released all those people from hell.
On hearing Janaka's answer Kāla pointed out to him one
by one the sinners who were being tortured in hell
and explained things as follows:—“Look here, that
fellow there had seduced the wife of his most intimate
friend, and that is why he is tied to a red hot iron bar
for 10,000 years. After those 10,000 years he would be
born in a pig's womb, and when he is born among
human beings it would be as a eunuch. The other fellow
there forcibly kissed another man's wife, and so he has
to be roasted in Raurava hell for hundred years. That
other fellow is put into this vessel filled with blood and
pus with both his hands cut off as he had stolen other
people's property. This fellow did not speak even a
word of welcome to a tired and hungry man who sought
his hospitality at night. That is why he has been thrown
into thick darkness, and there, for a hundred years, he
must undergo the additional suffering of wasp-bite. As
for this man he had in a loud voice found fault with
another man, and this other fellow is his friend who
listened to those vilifications attentively. And, that is
the reason why both of them have been pushed into
this unused well. So, all these people have to suffer for
their sins. You, King Janaka, who did only righteous
acts will please go away from this accursed place.”
<div n="NI"/>Janaka asked Kāla how those sinners could be released
from hell, and Kāla answered that if any good act of
[Page345-a+ 64]
the King was transferred to them they could be set
free. One early morning Janaka had, with a pure
heart, chanted “Rāma, Rāma” and that good act was
exchanged for the freedom of the sinners.
<div n="NI"/>After their release had been effected, Janaka asked
Kāla: “You say that only sinners come here. What sin
have I committed that I should come here?” Kāla's
reply to the question was as follows:—“Oh! King,
no one else in the whole world has so much puṇya as
you have got. But, a small sin you have committed.
Once you prevented a cow from eating grass, and,
therefore, you had to come up to the gates of hell. Now,
that sin has been atoned for. So you may go to svarga.”
Janaka saluted Kāla and in the divine vimāna went to
Heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapters 30 and 31).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Artificial Janaka.%} While Sītā was a captive in Laṅkā
Rāvaṇa, to bring her round, deputed a very clever
magician called Marutta to her, disguised as Janaka,
her father. And Marutta, in the capacity of her father
consoled her and advised her to yield to the wishes of
Rāvaṇa. But Sītā did not yield, and the artificial Janaka
assumed his original form of Marutta and went away.
(Kaṃba Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa).
