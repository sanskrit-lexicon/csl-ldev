JAIGĪṢAVYA¦. A hermit who attained salvation by the
strength of his penance.
<div n="NI"/>It is stated in Harivaṃśa Chapter 18, that three
daughters, Aparṇā, Ekaparṇā and Ekapāṭalā were
born to Himālaya by Menā and the hermit Devala
married Ekaparṇā and the hermit Jaigīṣavya married
Ekapāṭalā. In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter
229, mention is made that this hermit gave much
advice to the hermit Devala, son of Asita, about the
need for equanimity. On another occasion this hermit
talked to Yudhiṣṭhira about the glory of Śiva. (M.B.
Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 18, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about how this hermit Jaigīṣavya
attained the world of Brahmā. Once he reached the
hermitage of Devala, who showed the necessary
hospitalities. After a few days this hermit disappeared.
After that he used to be seen only at the time of meals.
Once Devala took his waterpot and went by air to the
sea, to fetch water. When he reached the sea he saw
Jaigīṣavya bathing there. Devala had gone when
Jaigīṣavya was in the hermitage. How did he reach
the sea before Devala? Devala filled the pot and
returned thoughtful. When he reached the hermitage
Jaigīṣavya was there. After this Devala travelled
through the world of the inspired sages. Wherever he
went, he saw Jaigīṣavya. He asked the inspired
sages how it was possible. They praised the attain-
ments, Jaigīṣavya had obtained, by his ‘tapas’
(penance). Finally in the sight of everybody, Jaigīṣavya
flew to the world of Brahmā. (M.B. Śalya Parva,
Chapter 50).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
11, Stanza 24, that this hermit Jaigīṣavya sits in the
palace of Brahmā and carries on meditation and con-
templation on Brahmā.
