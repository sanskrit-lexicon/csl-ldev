BHĀRYĀ¦. Wife. Bhīṣma points out the sanctified impor-
<div n="lb"/>tance of Bhāryā (wife) as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Without her even the palace will prove itself to be just a
<div n="lb"/>forest. She will be a great support (to the husband) in
<div n="lb"/>the matter of dharma (duty) artha (wealth) and Kāma
<div n="lb"/>(enjoyment of material comforts). (These three precede
<div n="lb"/>the ultimate state of Mokṣa (salvation) and the wife will
<div n="lb"/>be a great support in fulfilling the conditions during the
<div n="lb"/>first three stages.) While on tour in foreign places she
<div n="lb"/>will remain faithful to him and instil confidence in him.
<div n="lb"/>Bhāryā is great wealth to man.
<div n="NI"/>In his forlorn life on earth the wife is of great help to
<div n="lb"/>man. To him, who is suffering from diseases and is
<div n="lb"/>otherwise in distress there is no remedy (medicine) like
<div n="lb"/>a good wife. There is no relative like a wife. In the
<div n="lb"/>matter of practising dharma there is no other support to
<div n="lb"/>match the wife. If one has no good wife to take care of
<div n="lb"/>domestic affairs one will be driven to the forest; the
<div n="lb"/>home will be like a forest. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 144).
