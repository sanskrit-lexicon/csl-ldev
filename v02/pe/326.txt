AṆIMĀṆḌAVYA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General. How he got the name Aṇimāṇḍavya.%} Once
<div n="lb"/>there was a famous Brahmin named Māṇḍavya. He did
<div n="lb"/>Tapas (penance) for many years standing silent in
<div n="lb"/>front of his Āśrama, under a tree, raising his hands in
<div n="lb"/>prayer. At that time some thieves happened to pass by
<div n="lb"/>that place, with stolen property belonging to the King.
<div n="lb"/>Finding that the King's men were pursuing them, the
<div n="lb"/>thieves fled away after leaving their stolen property in
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍavya's Āśrama. The King's men seized Māṇḍavya
<div n="lb"/>with the king's property. Even prolonged and repeated
<div n="lb"/>questionings did not bring out a single word from
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍavya. At last the thieves were caught. Mistaking
<div n="lb"/>him as one of the thieves, the King's men produced
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍavya also along with the thieves before the King.
<div n="lb"/>The thieves were all condemned to death. The royal
<div n="lb"/>executioners took all of them to the place of execution
<div n="lb"/>and stuck them up at the tip of a trident (Śūla). The
<div n="lb"/>thieves died, but even after a long time Māṇḍavya did
[Page042-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>not die. In Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Verses 46-
<div n="lb"/>51, it is said that at this stage Śiva appeared and blessed
<div n="lb"/>him with longevity and then vanished. Several Munis in
<div n="lb"/>the shape of birds came near Māṇḍavya who was lying
<div n="lb"/>on the trident and made enquiries about him. The King
<div n="lb"/>came to know of all these stories. Full of repentance, he
<div n="lb"/>went and begged pardon of Māṇḍavya. The attempt
<div n="lb"/>to pull out the trident from Māṇḍavya's body failed. At
<div n="lb"/>last it was removed by cutting it off. Since the tip (Aṇi)
<div n="lb"/>of the trident was left behind in his body he was there-
<div n="lb"/>after known as “Aṇi Māṇḍavya”. (M.B., Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 107).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse on Dharma.%} After going about in the world
<div n="lb"/>for many years with the tip of the trident in his body,
<div n="lb"/>Aṇi Māṇḍavya once asked Dharma: “Oh! Lord, why
<div n="lb"/>is it that an innocent man like me is afflicted with the
<div n="lb"/>trident?”. Dharma answered: “In your boyhood
<div n="lb"/>you once caught small birds and pierced them with
<div n="lb"/>a grass reed. It is a result of that sin that you have been
<div n="lb"/>pierced with the trident.” Māṇḍavya replied: “The
<div n="lb"/>Śāstras ordain that there shall be no punishment for
<div n="lb"/>sins committed till the age of twelve. Therefore the
<div n="lb"/>punishment inflicted on me is wrong. As the murder
<div n="lb"/>of a Brahmin is a greater sin than any other murder,
<div n="lb"/>may you be born as a man in the ‘Śūdra Caste’.”
<div n="NI"/>By the above curse of Māṇḍavya, Dharma was born a
<div n="lb"/>son of a Śūdra woman. It was this child who later on
<div n="lb"/>became the renowned Vidura of the Mahābhārata.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 107).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The story of how the Sun did not rise.%} When Aṇi
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍavya lay on the tip of the trident another event
<div n="lb"/>happened. Atri Muni's son Ugraśravas was the husband
<div n="lb"/>of Śīlavatī. No other woman had so far surpassed
<div n="lb"/>Śīlavatī in her fidelity to her husband. Once Ugraśravas
<div n="lb"/>happened to fall ill. He expressed his desire to visit a
<div n="lb"/>prostitute's house. As he was too weak he could not walk.
<div n="lb"/>The devoted wife Śīlavatī carried him on her own
<div n="lb"/>shoulders and took him to the prostitute's house. They
<div n="lb"/>were passing near the place where Aṇi Māṇḍavya was
<div n="lb"/>lying on the trident. Coming to know of the matter,
<div n="lb"/>Māṇḍavya pronounced a curse that Ugraśravas should
<div n="lb"/>die before sunrise. Śīlavatī shuddered on hearing this.
<div n="lb"/>Fearing that she would be widowed by the death of
<div n="lb"/>Ugraśravas, she, in her turn, pronounced a curse that
<div n="lb"/>the Sun should not rise again.
<div n="NI"/>Next day the sun did not rise. All activities came to a
<div n="lb"/>standstill. At last the gods approached Atri Muni. They
<div n="lb"/>induced Anasūyā, Atri's wife to persuade Śīlavatī to
<div n="lb"/>withdraw her curse. Then the sun rose again and
<div n="lb"/>Ugraśravas died. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 42).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%} When the Pāṇḍavas were living in
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura, Śrī Kṛṣṇa once paid a visit to them. On
<div n="lb"/>his way he met with certain munis. Among them was
<div n="lb"/>Aṇi Māṇḍavya also. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 83).
<div n="NI"/>5) Once the King of Videha told Māṇḍavya that the
<div n="lb"/>world is transient and advised him to strive for spiritual
<div n="lb"/>peace. Aṇi Māṇḍavya who was pleased with the
<div n="lb"/>King's advice attained mokṣa (salvation) at once. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 276, Verses 3-14).
