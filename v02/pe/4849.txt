NIŚĀKARA I¦. A maharṣi. Honoured even by the Devas
he lived in his āśrama on the heights of Mount Vindhya.
One of those days Jaṭāyu and his elder brother Sampāti,
under a bet, flew up to the Sun's sphere. In his attempt
to shield Jaṭāyu, who flew with great speed and neared
the Sun's sphere, from the scorching heat of the Sun,
Sampāti's wings got burned and he fell down on the
heights of Vindhya where he lay unconscious for six
days.
<div n="NI"/>Niśākara maharṣi heard Sampāti crying and he saved
the bird, which lived there for many years as the
maharṣi's slave. The maharṣi, who could foresee things
told Sampāti about Śrī Rāma's incarnation which was
to happen in the future. He entered Samādhi after
finally telling Sampāti that monkeys would go there
then in search of Sītā, that Sampāti would point out
to them where Sītā was and that on that day his wings
would automatically reappear and his legs would become
strong. Afterwards for eight thousand years Sampāti led
a solitary life in the āśrama. It was during this period
that monkeys, in the course of their search for Sītā got
information about her from Sampāti. (Kamba Rāmā-
yaṇa; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Canto
60).
