KṚTAYUGA¦. There are four Yugas (Eras) called Kṛta,
Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali yugas. (For the set up etc.
of the Yugas see under Manvantara).
<div n="NI"/>In the first Yuga, i.e. Kṛta yuga, people will be quite
righteous. As the Yugas change righteousness will fade
out in increasing measure till the world will be filled
with unrighteousness and evil by the time it is Kaliyuga.
When Kaliyuga is completed Mahāviṣṇu will incarnate
himself as Kalki and wipe out unrighteousness and estab-
lish Kṛtayuga once again.
