JAYA¦ XIII. The original name of the Mahābhārata writ-
<div n="lb"/>ten by Vyāsa, Many of the scholars are of opinion that
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa was not the author of the whole of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata that we see in its present form now. They say
<div n="lb"/>that the Bhārata written by Vyāsa consisted only of
<div n="lb"/>eight thousand and eight hundred stanzas. That work was
<div n="lb"/>named Jaya. To those eight thousand and eight hund-
<div n="lb"/>red stanzas Vaiśampāyana added fifteen thousand, two
<div n="lb"/>hundred stanzas and this great book was given the
<div n="lb"/>name Bhārata or Bhārata saṃhitā (Bhārata collection).
<div n="lb"/>When Sūta recited this book to other hermits in Naimi-
<div n="lb"/>śāraṇya the book had a lakh of stanzas. Henceforward
<div n="lb"/>the book was called Mahābhārata, (History of classical
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit Literature; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>62, Stanza 20).
