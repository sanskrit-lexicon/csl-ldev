DEVADĀSA¦. A rich Vaiśya extolled much in the Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara. He lived in Pātalipuṭra and had married the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of a very rich Vaiśya of Pauṇḍravardhana. After
<div n="lb"/>his father's death Devadāsa lost all his wealth in gamb-
<div n="lb"/>ling, and his wife forsook her impecunious husband and
<div n="lb"/>returned home.
<div n="NI"/>After roaming about for some time the helpless Devadāsa
<div n="lb"/>decided to go to his wife's house, and one mid-night
<div n="lb"/>he went there. While hiding himself there in the darkness
<div n="lb"/>he heard his wife telling her paramour the following:
<div n="lb"/>“In the four corners of Devadāsa's house are hidden
<div n="lb"/>four treasures. But he does not know about the treasures
<div n="lb"/>hidden thus by one of his fore-fathers. I got the informa-
<div n="lb"/>tion from his mother. You should purchase the pro-
<div n="lb"/>perty for a small price.”
<div n="NI"/>No sooner did Devadāsa hear the above than he
<div n="lb"/>hurried back to his house and dug up the treasure
<div n="lb"/>and thus became wealthy again. The paramour of his
<div n="lb"/>wife went to him a few days later and purchased the
<div n="lb"/>property at a heavy price. But, when he dug up the
<div n="lb"/>place no treasure was found. Then he wanted to sell
<div n="lb"/>back the property to Devadāsa himself, but he refused
<div n="lb"/>to purchase it. The case was taken before the King when
<div n="lb"/>Devadāsa detailed the whole story. And, as ordered by
<div n="lb"/>the King, Devadāsa disfigured his wife and wedded
<div n="lb"/>another wife. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃbakam,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 5).
