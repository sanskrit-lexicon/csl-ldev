DEVADĀSA¦. A rich Vaiśya extolled much in the Kathā-
saritsāgara. He lived in Pātalipuṭra and had married the
daughter of a very rich Vaiśya of Pauṇḍravardhana. After
his father's death Devadāsa lost all his wealth in gamb-
ling, and his wife forsook her impecunious husband and
returned home.
<div n="NI"/>After roaming about for some time the helpless Devadāsa
decided to go to his wife's house, and one mid-night
he went there. While hiding himself there in the darkness
he heard his wife telling her paramour the following:
“In the four corners of Devadāsa's house are hidden
four treasures. But he does not know about the treasures
hidden thus by one of his fore-fathers. I got the informa-
tion from his mother. You should purchase the pro-
perty for a small price.”
<div n="NI"/>No sooner did Devadāsa hear the above than he
hurried back to his house and dug up the treasure
and thus became wealthy again. The paramour of his
wife went to him a few days later and purchased the
property at a heavy price. But, when he dug up the
place no treasure was found. Then he wanted to sell
back the property to Devadāsa himself, but he refused
to purchase it. The case was taken before the King when
Devadāsa detailed the whole story. And, as ordered by
the King, Devadāsa disfigured his wife and wedded
another wife. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃbakam,
Taraṅga 5).
