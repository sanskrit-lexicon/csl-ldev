CATURĀSYA¦. A heroic asura. Once he fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with Rambhā, and on his request Svayamprabhā,
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā's attendant, won over her mistress to the asura.
<div n="lb"/>The asura, Rambhā and Svayamprabhā then shifted
<div n="lb"/>their residence to a beautiful palace built in south India
<div n="lb"/>by Maya for Caturāsya. But, Indra who felt Rambhā's
<div n="lb"/>absence badly came down to earth, killed Caturāsya
<div n="lb"/>and took Rambhā back with him. Indra cursed Svayam-
<div n="lb"/>prabhā to remain on earth. And, he told her that she
<div n="lb"/>should welcome and treat well the monkeys who would
<div n="lb"/>be arriving there in their quest of Sītā, and then she
<div n="lb"/>would get redemption from the curse. The above facts
<div n="lb"/>were revealed by Svayamprabhā herself while welcom-
<div n="lb"/>ing the monkeys. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa).
