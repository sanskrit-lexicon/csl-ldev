CATURĀSYA¦. A heroic asura. Once he fell in love
with Rambhā, and on his request Svayamprabhā,
Rambhā's attendant, won over her mistress to the asura.
The asura, Rambhā and Svayamprabhā then shifted
their residence to a beautiful palace built in south India
by Maya for Caturāsya. But, Indra who felt Rambhā's
absence badly came down to earth, killed Caturāsya
and took Rambhā back with him. Indra cursed Svayam-
prabhā to remain on earth. And, he told her that she
should welcome and treat well the monkeys who would
be arriving there in their quest of Sītā, and then she
would get redemption from the curse. The above facts
were revealed by Svayamprabhā herself while welcom-
ing the monkeys. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa).
