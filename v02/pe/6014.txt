SĀLVA IV¦. In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa a Sālva, who was a
<div n="lb"/>contemporary of Kuśadhvaja, is mentioned. Kuśadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>once approached this king Sālva and requested for some
<div n="lb"/>financial help. But the covetous Sālva did not give any
<div n="lb"/>help. So Kuśadhvaja performed a sacrifice to obtain
<div n="lb"/>wealth and prosperity. Sītā was born from that sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficial fire. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
