ṚṢYAŚṚṄGA¦. Son of the sage Vibhāṇḍaka.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Vibhāṇḍaka, son of Kaśyapa was the father
of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. There is a strange story about him in
the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>Once sage Vibhāṇḍaka happened to see Urvaśī at
Mahāhrada. At the very sight of her, the sage had an
involuntary emission of semen. The semen fell in the
water and just then a female deer came there to drink
water. It swallowed the semen with water and in due
course became pregnant and gave birth to a human
child. But the child had the horns of a deer. Conse-
quently Vibhāṇḍaka named the boy “Ṛṣyaśṛṅga”.
Vibhāṇḍaka and Ṛṣyaśṛṅga lived together in the
āśrama. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga grew up into a youth, but he had
never seen anyone except his father Vibhāṇḍaka.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Rainfall in the kingdom of Aṅga.%} At that time, the
kingdom of Aṅga was ruled by Lomapāda, a friend of
Daśaratha. Once he cheated a Brāhmaṇa. Consequently
all the Brāhmaṇas in that country left the place and
emigrated to other lands. From that time there was no
rain in the land of Aṅga. A severe drought and famine
followed. Lomapāda invited devout Brāhmaṇas and
consulted them how they could bring rain to the land.
They told him that if he could get a Muni (sage) who
had never seen women to perform a yāga, there would
be rainfall in the land. The King sent his men far and
wide to find a Muni who had never set eyes on a wo-
man At last he got news that Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, son of
Vibhāṇḍaka was the sage who had never seen women.
He then began to plan how Ṛṣyaśṛṅga could be brought
over to Aṅga.
<div n="NI"/>Lomapāda called together some prostitutes and asked
them whether they could bring Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to his
country. All except one of them said it was quite
[Page652-b+ 64]
impossible. One of them, however, agreed to try. As
desired by her, the King sent her with several other
damsels.
<div n="NI"/>The young women went to the forest and made a
floating āśrama in a boat in which they sailed in the
river by the side of Vibhāṇḍāka's āśrama. They stopped
the boat close to the āśrama and one of the girls enter-
ed the āśrama when Vibhāṇḍaka was not there. She
had a talk with Ṛṣyaśṛṅga in the course of which she
used all the amorous enchantments of her sex to captivate
the young Muni. She told him that she was the
daughter of a Muni, living in an āśrama, three yojanas
away. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga felt a peculiar fascination for her and
tried to please her by offering fruits etc. When she left
him, he felt deeply distressed and unhappy. He was in
that depressed and gloomy state of mind when Vibhāṇḍaka
returned to the āśrama. Finding him unusually restless
and dejected, the father asked him whether anyone
had come there. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga who was an entire stranger
to the feminine world told his father that a handsome
youth of irresistible charm had visited him during
Vibhāṇḍaka's absence. But from Ṛṣyaśṛṅga's description
of the “youth” Vibhāṇḍaka understood that the visitor
must have been a woman. But he could not guess who
it was.
<div n="NI"/>On another occasion, the same woman came again to
the āśrama in the absence of Vibhāṇḍaka. At her sight
Ṛṣyaśṛṅga was enraptured and before his father's
return, they left the āśrama. They entered the floating
āśrama in the boat and the woman set the boat sailing
in the river. It glided slowly down the river and at
last reached near the palace of Lomapāda. They landed
there and the King married his daughter Sāntā to
Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.
<div n="NI"/>To appease Vidhāṇḍaka, Lomapāda sent him rich
presents and much wealth. When Vibhāṇḍaka returned
to his āśrama he was met by the King's servants who
had brought the presents and wealth. Ignoring them
and their rich presents, the furious Maharṣi set out to
the city of Campā, the capital of the Aṅga Kingdom.
At the royal command, Vibhāṇḍaka was welcomed by
the people with honour. When the sage found that
the whole kingdom belonged to his son, his anger was
allayed. After ordering his son to return to his āśrama
after the birth of a son, Vibhāṇḍaka left the palace.
As a result of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga's yāga there was rainfall in
Aṅga and famine ended. After the birth of his child he
returned to the forest as ordered by his father. (M.B.
Araṇya Parva, Chapters 110-112).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga in Ayodhyā.%} King Daśaratha of Ayodhyā
had no children for a long time. His Minister
Sumantra advised him to invite Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to perform
a yāga for the purpose. Lomapāda sent Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to
Ayodhyā at the invitation of Daśaratha. He arrived at
Ayodhyā and performed a yāga called Putrakāmeṣṭi.
From the sacrificial fire there arose a dark monstrous
figure, with a pot of pudding in his hand. Daśaratha
received it from him and gave one half of it to Kau-
salyā and the other half to Kaikeyī. Both of them gave
half of their shares to Sumitrā. Thus Sumitrā got two
shares while the other two wives of Daśaratha got only
one share each. As a result Kausalyā and Kaikeyī gave
birth to a son each, while Sumitrā had two sons.
Kausalyā's son was named Rāma, Kaikeyī's son was
[Page653-a+ 65]
Bharata and Sumitrā's sons were Lakṣmaṇa and
Śatrughna. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Chapters
14-16).
