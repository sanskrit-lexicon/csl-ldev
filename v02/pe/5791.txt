ṚṢYAŚṚṄGA¦. Son of the sage Vibhāṇḍaka.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Vibhāṇḍaka, son of Kaśyapa was the father
<div n="lb"/>of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. There is a strange story about him in
<div n="lb"/>the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>Once sage Vibhāṇḍaka happened to see Urvaśī at
<div n="lb"/>Mahāhrada. At the very sight of her, the sage had an
<div n="lb"/>involuntary emission of semen. The semen fell in the
<div n="lb"/>water and just then a female deer came there to drink
<div n="lb"/>water. It swallowed the semen with water and in due
<div n="lb"/>course became pregnant and gave birth to a human
<div n="lb"/>child. But the child had the horns of a deer. Conse-
<div n="lb"/>quently Vibhāṇḍaka named the boy “Ṛṣyaśṛṅga”.
<div n="lb"/>Vibhāṇḍaka and Ṛṣyaśṛṅga lived together in the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga grew up into a youth, but he had
<div n="lb"/>never seen anyone except his father Vibhāṇḍaka.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Rainfall in the kingdom of Aṅga.%} At that time, the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom of Aṅga was ruled by Lomapāda, a friend of
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha. Once he cheated a Brāhmaṇa. Consequently
<div n="lb"/>all the Brāhmaṇas in that country left the place and
<div n="lb"/>emigrated to other lands. From that time there was no
<div n="lb"/>rain in the land of Aṅga. A severe drought and famine
<div n="lb"/>followed. Lomapāda invited devout Brāhmaṇas and
<div n="lb"/>consulted them how they could bring rain to the land.
<div n="lb"/>They told him that if he could get a Muni (sage) who
<div n="lb"/>had never seen women to perform a yāga, there would
<div n="lb"/>be rainfall in the land. The King sent his men far and
<div n="lb"/>wide to find a Muni who had never set eyes on a wo-
<div n="lb"/>man At last he got news that Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, son of
<div n="lb"/>Vibhāṇḍaka was the sage who had never seen women.
<div n="lb"/>He then began to plan how Ṛṣyaśṛṅga could be brought
<div n="lb"/>over to Aṅga.
<div n="NI"/>Lomapāda called together some prostitutes and asked
<div n="lb"/>them whether they could bring Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to his
<div n="lb"/>country. All except one of them said it was quite
[Page652-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>impossible. One of them, however, agreed to try. As
<div n="lb"/>desired by her, the King sent her with several other
<div n="lb"/>damsels.
<div n="NI"/>The young women went to the forest and made a
<div n="lb"/>floating āśrama in a boat in which they sailed in the
<div n="lb"/>river by the side of Vibhāṇḍāka's āśrama. They stopped
<div n="lb"/>the boat close to the āśrama and one of the girls enter-
<div n="lb"/>ed the āśrama when Vibhāṇḍaka was not there. She
<div n="lb"/>had a talk with Ṛṣyaśṛṅga in the course of which she
<div n="lb"/>used all the amorous enchantments of her sex to captivate
<div n="lb"/>the young Muni. She told him that she was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of a Muni, living in an āśrama, three yojanas
<div n="lb"/>away. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga felt a peculiar fascination for her and
<div n="lb"/>tried to please her by offering fruits etc. When she left
<div n="lb"/>him, he felt deeply distressed and unhappy. He was in
<div n="lb"/>that depressed and gloomy state of mind when Vibhāṇḍaka
<div n="lb"/>returned to the āśrama. Finding him unusually restless
<div n="lb"/>and dejected, the father asked him whether anyone
<div n="lb"/>had come there. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga who was an entire stranger
<div n="lb"/>to the feminine world told his father that a handsome
<div n="lb"/>youth of irresistible charm had visited him during
<div n="lb"/>Vibhāṇḍaka's absence. But from Ṛṣyaśṛṅga's description
<div n="lb"/>of the “youth” Vibhāṇḍaka understood that the visitor
<div n="lb"/>must have been a woman. But he could not guess who
<div n="lb"/>it was.
<div n="NI"/>On another occasion, the same woman came again to
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama in the absence of Vibhāṇḍaka. At her sight
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga was enraptured and before his father's
<div n="lb"/>return, they left the āśrama. They entered the floating
<div n="lb"/>āśrama in the boat and the woman set the boat sailing
<div n="lb"/>in the river. It glided slowly down the river and at
<div n="lb"/>last reached near the palace of Lomapāda. They landed
<div n="lb"/>there and the King married his daughter Sāntā to
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.
<div n="NI"/>To appease Vidhāṇḍaka, Lomapāda sent him rich
<div n="lb"/>presents and much wealth. When Vibhāṇḍaka returned
<div n="lb"/>to his āśrama he was met by the King's servants who
<div n="lb"/>had brought the presents and wealth. Ignoring them
<div n="lb"/>and their rich presents, the furious Maharṣi set out to
<div n="lb"/>the city of Campā, the capital of the Aṅga Kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>At the royal command, Vibhāṇḍaka was welcomed by
<div n="lb"/>the people with honour. When the sage found that
<div n="lb"/>the whole kingdom belonged to his son, his anger was
<div n="lb"/>allayed. After ordering his son to return to his āśrama
<div n="lb"/>after the birth of a son, Vibhāṇḍaka left the palace.
<div n="lb"/>As a result of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga's yāga there was rainfall in
<div n="lb"/>Aṅga and famine ended. After the birth of his child he
<div n="lb"/>returned to the forest as ordered by his father. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Parva, Chapters 110-112).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga in Ayodhyā.%} King Daśaratha of Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>had no children for a long time. His Minister
<div n="lb"/>Sumantra advised him to invite Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to perform
<div n="lb"/>a yāga for the purpose. Lomapāda sent Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā at the invitation of Daśaratha. He arrived at
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā and performed a yāga called Putrakāmeṣṭi.
<div n="lb"/>From the sacrificial fire there arose a dark monstrous
<div n="lb"/>figure, with a pot of pudding in his hand. Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>received it from him and gave one half of it to Kau-
<div n="lb"/>salyā and the other half to Kaikeyī. Both of them gave
<div n="lb"/>half of their shares to Sumitrā. Thus Sumitrā got two
<div n="lb"/>shares while the other two wives of Daśaratha got only
<div n="lb"/>one share each. As a result Kausalyā and Kaikeyī gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to a son each, while Sumitrā had two sons.
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā's son was named Rāma, Kaikeyī's son was
[Page653-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Bharata and Sumitrā's sons were Lakṣmaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Chapters
<div n="lb"/>14-16).
