PRASENAJIT IV¦. A King who lived in the city of
Śrāvastī. Once a very virtuous brahmin came to this
city. Finding him to be a man of great virtues a Vaiśya
took him to his house and kept him there worshipping
him. Many rich men coming to know of the brahmin
came and worshipped him with offerings of costly
clothes and ornaments. Within a short time the poor
brahmin got a huge heap of gold and silver. He collect-
ed his lot and at night without letting anybody know
went and buried it in a secret place in the forest.
After some days he went and looked for it and found
his buried wealth missing. When the brahmin returned
weeping, the host, the Vaiśya, gathered from him all
that had happened. The house-holder consoled him
but the miserly and greedy brahmin was not to be
pacified thus and he started to commit suicide. He
went to a pond nearby and was about to jump into it
when Prasenajit who heard about this came to the
spot and told him thus:—“Do not grieve over your
loss. I shall make enquiries about it and if the stolen
wealth is not recovered I shall give you compensation
from my treasury.”
<div n="NI"/>After consoling the brahmin thus the King went to
his palace. He pretended to be ill and called the
physicians of the city to his side. He asked them about
their patients, their illness and the medicines prescribed
for them. One of the physicians during the enquiry
said thus: “Oh lord, Mātṛdattavaṇik is my patient.
Yesterday I prescribed to him the root of Ūraka
plant.” The King soon dispersed the physicians and
sent for Mātṛdattavaṇik and asked him who had
brought for him the root. When Mātṛdattavaṇik
replied that it was his servant the King sent for the
servant and on questioning the servant the latter
confessed having taken the hidden treasure. Thus
because of the intelligence and wisdom of the King
the brahmin got back his wealth. (Taraṅga 7, Madana-
mañcukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
