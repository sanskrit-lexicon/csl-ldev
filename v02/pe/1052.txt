BHARADVĀJA V¦. A maharṣi born of the line of Aṅgi-
ras. He was the father of Yavakrīta and a friend of
Raibhya, son of Viśvāmitra.
<div n="NI"/>Once Raibhya created a Kritya and that Kritya killed
Bharadvāja's son Yavakrīta. Unable to bear the loss of his
son Bharadvāja was preparing to give up his own life
by jumping into the fire when Arvāvasu brought to life
Yavakrīta and gave him to the sage. Immensely pleas-
ed at the regain of his son Bharadvāja ended his life
on earth and went to heaven. (M.B., Vana Parva,
165-168)
