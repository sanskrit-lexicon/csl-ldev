HARIMITRA¦. A brahmin, who had his āśrama on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Yamunā. Owing to his association with
<div n="lb"/>Harimitra a sinner called Vikuṇḍala took his bath
<div n="lb"/>in the sacred waters of the Kālindī during two Māgha
<div n="lb"/>months. The first bath released him from all his sins
<div n="lb"/>and the second bath made him eligible to go to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Thus Harimitra was responsible for the attainment of
<div n="lb"/>heaven by the sinner Vikuṇḍala. (Padma Purāṇa, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa, Chapter 31).
