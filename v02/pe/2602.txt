HARIMITRA¦. A brahmin, who had his āśrama on the
banks of the Yamunā. Owing to his association with
Harimitra a sinner called Vikuṇḍala took his bath
in the sacred waters of the Kālindī during two Māgha
months. The first bath released him from all his sins
and the second bath made him eligible to go to heaven.
Thus Harimitra was responsible for the attainment of
heaven by the sinner Vikuṇḍala. (Padma Purāṇa, Ādi
Khaṇḍa, Chapter 31).
