SUNDA¦. An asura. He had a brother named Upasunda,
<div n="lb"/>and their father was Niśumbha alias Jharjha. Sunda
<div n="lb"/>and Upasunda were very cruel asuras.
<div n="NI"/>The two brothers performed tapas on the Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>mountain with the object of conquering the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds. All attempts made by Devas to break up their
<div n="lb"/>penance failed and ultimately Brahmā appeared before
<div n="lb"/>them. They secured from Brahmā a boon to the effect
<div n="lb"/>that they would not be killed by anyone else but only
<div n="lb"/>mutually by them. Swollen-headed by the boon the
<div n="lb"/>brothers conquered the three worlds and none could
<div n="lb"/>kill them. Ultimately the Devas sent Tilottamā, the
<div n="lb"/>celestial damsel to them and she made them quarrel
<div n="lb"/>with each other. Both of them who fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>Tilottamā and wanted her as wife fought with each
<div n="lb"/>other and got killed. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 221, Verse
<div n="lb"/>19). For details see under Upasunda and Tāṭakā).
