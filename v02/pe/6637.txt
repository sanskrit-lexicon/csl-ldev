ŚIŚUNĀGA¦. The first King of the Śiśunāga dynasty.
He founded the dynasty after defeating Nandivardhana
of Pradyota family, King of Magadha. Though he
first belonged to Kāśī region, later on he settled down
in Magadha. Kākavarṇa was Śiśunāga's son.
<div n="NI"/>The following ten Kings of Śiśunāga dynasty ruled the
country for 360 years. (1) Kākavarṇa (2) Kṣema-
dharmā (3) Kṣemajit (4) Vindhyasena (5) Bhūmi-
mitra (6) Ajātaśatru (7) Vaṃśaka (8) Udāsī (9)

<div n="NI"/>ŚIŚUPĀLA. King of Cedi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Previous birth.%} Jaya and Vijaya, gate-keepers at
Vaikuṇṭha were born thrice in asura womb as a result
of the curse by munis like Sanaka. They were first
born as Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, next as
Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa and the third time as
Śiśupāla and Dantavaktra. (See under Jayavijayas).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śiśupāla was the son of King Damaghoṣa
of Cedi by his wife, Śrutaśravas (Bhāgavata, 9th
Skandha). He was born with three eyes and four
hands, and at the time of birth he brayed like an ass,
so the parents decided to abandon the ugly and awkward
child. Immediately a Jin (ghost) appeared and told
the father that the child would grow up to become very
strong and powerful, and that only one person would
be able to kill him and that person had already been
born on earth. Further questioned by Śiśupāla's
mother, the Jin said that as soon as the son saw the
person born to kill him, he would lose his third eye,
and that if he was seated on the lap of the person, two
[Page720-a+ 64]
out of his four hands would be lost. After having said
this the Jin disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>News about this peculiar child spread far and wide
and many kings visited him. Damaghoṣa placed the
child on the lap of each of them. But, no physical
change occurred to him. Then one day Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
Balabhadra came to see the child, whose mother
Śrutaśravas (she was also the sister of Kṛṣṇa's father)
placed him on Kṛṣṇa's lap. immediately two hands and
the third eye of the child vanished, and with tears in
her eyes the mother prayed Kṛṣṇa never to kill
Śiśupāla, and Kṛṣṇa promised that he would forgive
the crimes of Śiśupāla a hundred times. (Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 43).
