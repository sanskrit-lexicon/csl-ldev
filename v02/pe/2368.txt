GAURAMUKHA¦. A son of sage Śamīka. It was
Śamīka's son Śṛṅgī, who cursed Parīkṣit to death by
snake-bite. (See Parīkṣit). Śṛṅgī cursed that Parīkṣit,
who had thrown a dead snake on the neck of his father
while in meditation, would be bitten to death by snake
within seven days. Śṛṅgī sent word about the curse
through his disciple Gauramukha to Parīkṣit. (Ādi
Parva, Chapter 42, Verses 14-22).
