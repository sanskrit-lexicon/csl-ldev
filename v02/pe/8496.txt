VIṢṆUCITTA¦. A noble Vaiṣṇavite devotee, who lived
<div n="lb"/>in Tamil Nadu. He lived in Villiputtur. It is said that
<div n="lb"/>he was the incarnation of Garuḍa. Viṣṇucitta had ano-
<div n="lb"/>ther name Periyālvār. Āṇḍāl who was famous among
<div n="lb"/>the Ālvārs was the daughter of Viṣṇucitta.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇucitta sang holy hymns in praise of the beloved
<div n="lb"/>god. The hymns of praise he sang are called Pallāṇḍu.
<div n="lb"/>He got the name Periyālvār or the foremost of the devo-
<div n="lb"/>tees.
<div n="NI"/>Once at Villiputtur, while he was getting beds ready to
<div n="lb"/>plant holy basil, he was attracted by a divine infant. It
<div n="lb"/>seemed to Viṣṇucitta that the little girl was lying among
<div n="lb"/>the basil plants. He took the child home and named
<div n="lb"/>her Godā. It was this Godā who became the famous
<div n="lb"/>Āṇḍāl later. Legends say that the birth of Āṇḍāl was
<div n="lb"/>in 97 Kali Era. Scholars say that Godā was born in the
<div n="lb"/>middle of 7th century. There is another story which
<div n="lb"/>mentions that Āṇḍāl was born from a portion of
<div n="lb"/>Goddess Earth.
