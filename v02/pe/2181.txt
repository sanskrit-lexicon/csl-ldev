DURMADA II¦. A son of Haṃsa, the Gandharva King.
<div n="lb"/>Himself and Unmadā, the apsarā woman impersonated
<div n="lb"/>themselves and cheated Purūravas and Urvaśī (See
<div n="lb"/>Unmadā). Enraged at the deception Urvaśī cursed
<div n="lb"/>that Durmada be born as a Rākṣasa and Unmadā a
<div n="lb"/>princess. Also, Unmadā as princess would have to marry
<div n="lb"/>not the person she really loved but some one else.
<div n="lb"/>Both Durmada and Unmadā then begged Urvaśī for
[Page255-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>redemption from the curse and the latter said thus:
<div n="lb"/>“This Durmada will be born as son of Unmadā, and
<div n="lb"/>on seeing her son and husband die, she will end her
<div n="lb"/>life by burning herself, and her soul will attain Svarga”.
<div n="NI"/>As a result of the above curse Unmadā was born as
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of the King of Videha and Durmada as
<div n="lb"/>the son of the Rākṣasa called Dīrghajaṃgha. As Rākṣasa,
<div n="lb"/>Durmada was called Piṅgalākṣa. The King of Videha
<div n="lb"/>named Unmadā as Hariṇī.
<div n="NI"/>While Hariṇī was once walking in the garden with her
<div n="lb"/>companions Piṅgalākṣa abducted her and flew off in
<div n="lb"/>the sky, and put her in a great forest. A prince called
<div n="lb"/>Vasumanas, who happened to come that way on his
<div n="lb"/>fast-riding horse Jīmūta heard the lamentations of
<div n="lb"/>Hariṇī, and after killing Piṅgalākṣa he took her with
<div n="lb"/>him to her palace. The King of Videha and his sub-
<div n="lb"/>jects, who were in great anxiety and distress at the
<div n="lb"/>disappearance of Hariṇī felt really happy to have her
<div n="lb"/>back. And, all of them opined that Hariṇī should be
<div n="lb"/>married to Vasumanas. Accordingly the date for her
<div n="lb"/>Svayaṃvara was announced. But, on the day of the
<div n="lb"/>svayaṃvara Bhadraśreṇya, King of Hehaya who, along
<div n="lb"/>with other Kings was also present on the occasion,
<div n="lb"/>forcibly took Hariṇī and rode off with her. According
<div n="lb"/>to the condition laid down by Urvaśī for redemption
<div n="lb"/>from her curse Durmada was born as son of Hariṇī and
<div n="lb"/>he was named Durmada.
<div n="NI"/>Bhadraśreṇya, Hariṇī and Durmada lived very happily
<div n="lb"/>in the Hehaya palace. When Durmada came of age he
<div n="lb"/>married Citrāṅgī, his uncle's daughter on the advice
<div n="lb"/>of sage Garga. Soon war broke out between Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>śreṇya, and Divodāsa, King of Kāṣi in which Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>śreṇya was killed. Hariṇī courted death by fire,
<div n="lb"/>regained her former life and under the name Unmadā
<div n="lb"/>returned to the world of the Apsaras.
