VĀSUKI¦. One of the famous Nāgas (serpents).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The uragas and nāgas (serpents) were born
to Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Kadrū. Vāsuki, the
eldest son of Kadrū spent his childhood with his
parents.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Difference of opinion.%} Vinatā and Kadrū staked on
the colour of the tail of Uccaiśśravas (A horse obtained
at the churning of the sea of Milk. To win the stake,
Kadrū asked her sons to hang on the tail of Uccaiśś-
ravas as black hairs. But the truthful Vāsuki was not
prepared to do so. Kadrū cursed Vāsuki and the others
who sided with him. From that day onwards Vāsuki
and those who were cursed, separated from their mother
and formed into a serpent group. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapters 37 and 48)
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The length of Vāsuki.%} The Devas and the asuras
decided to get Amṛta (Ambrosia—the celestial honey of
immortality) by churning the sea of milk. The Devas
went to bring Mandara-mountain, to be used as the
churning rod. Their attempt was futile. The asuras
made a trial with the same result. The Bhūtagaṇas
(Guards) of Śiva also made a vain attempt. On the
instruction of Viṣṇu, Garuḍa went and brought the
mountain as easily as an eagle takes away a frog. Now
Vāsuki should be brought. The Devas and Gandharvas
failed in that attempt also. Garuḍa who was haughty
of his strength and speed, went to the city of the nāgas
(serpents) and requested Vāsuki to come to the sea of
Milk. Vāsuki replied that if the matter was so urgent
he had no objection for being carried to that place. He
took the middle part of Vāsuki in his beak and flew up
higher and higher and reached beyond the horizon.
Still the lower half of Vāsuki was lying on the ground.
So he took Vāsuki in his beak as folded in two. Still
the result was the same. Garuḍa became aware of the
impossibility of carrying Vāsuki and returned, ashamed
and disappointed. Viṣṇu rebuked him for his arrogance.
After this, Śiva stretched his hand to Pātāla. Vāsuki
became a small bangle on that hand. Thus Vāsuki was
brought to the shore of the sea of Milk. (Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
