<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ugrasena became king.%} Ugrasena became king of Mathu-
rāpurī. His Kingship was not a hereditary acquisition.
There is a story behind it. In olden days, in the plateau
of Kālindī there was a famous place called Madhuvana.
The place was called so because it was the abode of an
Asura named Madhu. Madhu had a son, Lavaṇa. Śatru-
ghna killed him as he was a very troublesome fellow
and a thorn on the side of the Devas. Śatrughna then
established a beautiful kingdom there and ruled it. He
named it Mathurā. After the death of Śatrughna his
two sons ruled Mathurā. Then, when the Solar dynasty
came to its end, Mathurā came under the Yādavas.
A Yādava king called Śūrasena ruled over the kingdom.
Vasudeva, father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of Śūrasena.
After the death of his father Vasudeva took up the pro-
fession of herding cows, and therefore Ugrasena,
another king of the Yādava dynasty had to become king
of Mathurā. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ugrasena and Kaṃsa.%} There is a common belief that
Kaṃsa was the son of Ugrasena. But, the Bhāgavata
relates the following to the effect that Kaṃsa was born
to a Gandharva called Dramila of Ugrasena's wife.
<div n="NI"/>When once Ugrasena's wife was in her monthly periods,
she walked in the forest with her companions. A Gan-
dharva called Dramila saw her then, felt attracted by her
and made her pregnant. Angered at this, she cursed
Dramila thus: “Since you have procreated a son in me,
while I am in my periods this son will be killed by a
boy born in my husband's family.” Kaṃsa was the son
born to her in the above manner. Kaṃsa ascended the
throne after putting Ugrasena in prison. According to the
curse of Ugrasena's wife, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was born in Ugra-
sena's family and he killed Kaṃsa. Nārada had informed
Kaṃsa of the Dramila interlude. Kaṃsa told this story
secretly to Akrūra when the latter was deputed by him
to invite Kṛṣṇa to the dhanur yajña. (Bhāgavata, 10th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>{%The name Āhuka.%} Genealogy states that Ugrasena was
the son of Āhuka. But, in certain contexts Ugrasena
is called Āhuka also. “Afterwards we made Āhuka-
Ugrasena King...” (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
128, Verse 39).

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ugrasena imprisoned.%} Vasudeva, father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa
was Ugrasena's minister. Kaṃsa, when he attained
majority imprisoned Ugrasena and became himself king.
(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 22).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Ugrasena regained kingdom.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa with
the permission of Ugrasena and made him king again.
During the reign of Ugrasena, Jarāsandha and Śālva
attacked Mathurāpurī. (See under Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Ugrasena and the iron rod.%} While Ugrasena was ruling
the Kingdom, the sages Viśvāmitra, Nārada and Kañja
once came to Dvārakā. To insult the sages, the Yādavas
brought before them, Sāmba dressed as a pregnant
woman. The Yādavas told the sages that she was Babhru's
wife, and wanted to be told whether the child she deli-
vered would be male or female. The sages understood
their evil mentality, and prophesied that Sāmba would
deliver an iron rod fierce enough to annihilate the
whole Yādava race. According to the prophecy the
next day Sāmba delivered an iron rod. The Yādavas
imparted the news to Ugrasena, who got the iron rod
reduced to powder and deposited the powder in the sea.
He also enforced prohibition of liquor in the country.
(To know how the powder of the rod ruined the Yādava
dynasty see under Kṛṣṇa). (M.B. Mausala Parva,
Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%After death.%} After his death, Ugrasena joined the
Viśvadevatās. Bhūriśravas, Śala, Bhūri, Kaṃsa-
Ugrasena, Vasudeva, Uttara with his brother Śaṅkha-
these kings (after death) joined the company of Viśva-
devatās. (M.B. Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5, Verses
16, 17).
