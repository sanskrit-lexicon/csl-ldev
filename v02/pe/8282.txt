VIDYUJJIHVA III¦. One of the important Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>followers of Rāvaṇa. This giant, by his sorcery and
<div n="lb"/>witch-craft, showed Sītā, the head cut off from the
<div n="lb"/>body of Śrī Rāma and his broken bow, to make her
<div n="lb"/>consent to become the wife of Rāvaṇa. He repeated
<div n="lb"/>this stratagem on several occasions. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 12).
