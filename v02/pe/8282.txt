VIDYUJJIHVA III¦. One of the important Rākṣasa
followers of Rāvaṇa. This giant, by his sorcery and
witch-craft, showed Sītā, the head cut off from the
body of Śrī Rāma and his broken bow, to make her
consent to become the wife of Rāvaṇa. He repeated
this stratagem on several occasions. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 12).
