SATYAVATĪ I¦. The mother of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%A short history.%} Satyavatī was the daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maid Adrikā. Because of a curse she lived as
<div n="lb"/>a fish in the river Ganges. Once the semen of King
<div n="lb"/>Uparicaravasu happened to fall in the Ganges and
<div n="lb"/>this fish swallowed it in consequence of which it became
<div n="lb"/>pregnant. A fisherman caught this fish and cut it. He
<div n="lb"/>got two human babies, male and female from the
<div n="lb"/>stomach of the fish. The fisherman gave the two
<div n="lb"/>infants to the King who took the male child. This
<div n="lb"/>child later became the Matsya King. The female child
<div n="lb"/>had the smell of fish. The King called her Matsya-
<div n="lb"/>Gandhī (She who has the smell of fish) and gave her
<div n="lb"/>back to the fisherman, who took the child to his hut
<div n="lb"/>and brought her up as his daughter. As the child was
<div n="lb"/>dark in complexion the fisherman called her Kālī. Thus
<div n="lb"/>the girl was known by two names Kālī and Matsya-
<div n="lb"/>gandhī. Later she got the name Satyavatī also.
<div n="NI"/>The fisherman was engaged in the work of ferrying
<div n="lb"/>people across the river. Matsyagandhī helped her
<div n="lb"/>father in this work. She became a full-bloomed young
<div n="lb"/>woman. One day the hermit Parāśara came by that
<div n="lb"/>way and when he saw Matsyagandhī, he fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with her. She ferried the hermit across the river. In
<div n="lb"/>the middle of the river Parāśara created an artificial fog
<div n="lb"/>inside which Parāśara took Matsyagandhī as his wife.
<div n="lb"/>From that moment Matsyagandhī became Kastūrī-
<div n="lb"/>gandhī (she who has the smell of Kastūrī (musk).
<div n="lb"/>Kālī became pregnant and delivered instantly. Parā-
<div n="lb"/>śara, left the place after having blessed her that she
<div n="lb"/>would not lose her virginity.
<div n="NI"/>The son born to Kālī, immediately grew up to be a
<div n="lb"/>youth. After promising his mother that he would
<div n="lb"/>come to her when she thought of him, the youth went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest for penance. The name of the son was
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. This Kṛṣṇa later became famous by the name
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa. Satyavatī again engaged herself in helping her
<div n="lb"/>father.
<div n="NI"/>One day Śantanu, a King of the lunar dynasty came to
<div n="lb"/>the forest for hunting. The fragrance of musk emanat-
<div n="lb"/>ing from the body of Kastūrīgandhī spread throughout
<div n="lb"/>the whole forest. The King walked on through the
<div n="lb"/>forest tracing the origin of the smell of musk and
<div n="lb"/>reached the fisherman's hut. The King fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī. The King had a son named Bhīṣma by his
<div n="lb"/>first wife Gaṅgā. Bhīṣma made it easy for the King to
[Page709-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>marry Satyavatī. Two sons Citrāṅgada and Vicitra-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya were born to Śantanu by his wife Satyavatī.
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada was killed in his boyhood. Vicitravīrya
<div n="lb"/>became a youth and married Ambikā and Ambālikā
<div n="lb"/>the daughters of the King of Kāśī. Vicitravīrya met
<div n="lb"/>with untimely death before a child was born to him.
<div n="lb"/>When Satyavatī saw that the family was about to
<div n="lb"/>become extinct, she thought of her son Vyāsa, who
<div n="lb"/>instantly arrived at the palace. From Vyāsa, Ambālikā
<div n="lb"/>got the son Pāṇḍu and Ambikā, the son Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="lb"/>Both the sons Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu got married.
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu died. The death of her son struck heavily at
<div n="lb"/>the heart of Satyavatī. She did not wish to live much
<div n="lb"/>longer after this. She mentioned about the fearful
<div n="lb"/>things yet to happen. Then taking her daughters-in-
<div n="lb"/>law Ambikā and Ambālikā with her, Satyavatī went to
<div n="lb"/>the forest to do penance and finally attained heaven.

<div n="lb"/>see under Adrikā, Vyāsa and Śantanu).
