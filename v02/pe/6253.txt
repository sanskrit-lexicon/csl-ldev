SAPTARṢIS¦. (The seven hermits). A group of hermits.
<div n="lb"/>There are seven hermits in this group. The Saptarṣis
<div n="lb"/>in each Manvantara (age of Manu) are different. As
<div n="lb"/>there are fourteen Manvantaras before a great deluge,
<div n="lb"/>by that time ninety-eight Saptarṣis will be born and
<div n="lb"/>dead. The father of the Saptarṣis in each Manu's age
<div n="lb"/>will be different. The Saptarṣis of the present Manu's
<div n="lb"/>age, Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha
<div n="lb"/>and Kratu are the mental sons of Brahmā. (For further
