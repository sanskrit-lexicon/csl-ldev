BRAHMACARYA¦. In ancient India an ideal life was
<div n="lb"/>considered to pass through four stages, and Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>carya is one of the stages of life. The four stages
<div n="lb"/>are Brahmacarya (Vedic student vowed to chastity),
<div n="lb"/>Gārhasthya (married householder), Vānaprastha (forest
<div n="lb"/>hermit) and Sannyāsa (an ascetic who has renounced
<div n="lb"/>the world). Brahmacarya, the first stage of the four
<div n="lb"/>is considered as the period of education. The rules and
<div n="lb"/>conduct of a Brahmacārī are given in Manusmṛti,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 2.
<div n="NI"/>The brahmacārī who lives with the teacher has to obey
<div n="lb"/>certain rules and principles. He should bathe in the
<div n="lb"/>river at sun-rise and offer oblations to gods and manes.
<div n="lb"/>A brahmacārī has to abstain from using honey, meat,
<div n="lb"/>fragrance, flowers, flower of chrysanthemum (Ind.)
<div n="lb"/>women, curd, milk, ghee, churned-curd, slaughter,
<div n="lb"/>bath applying oil, anointing the eyes with collyrium,
<div n="lb"/>sandals, umbrella, lust, anger, covetousness, dance,
<div n="lb"/>music, gambling, slander, ridicule, falsehood, and
<div n="lb"/>causing injury to others. A Brahmacārī should go to
<div n="lb"/>bed alone. Semen should not be made to discharge
<div n="lb"/>through lust. If seminal discharge occurs in dream he
<div n="lb"/>should take bath early in the morning and worship the
<div n="lb"/>Sun, pronouncing the mantra or spell ‘Punaḥ’ thrice.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmacārī should live on alms. It is the duty of
<div n="lb"/>the brahmacārī to bring water, flower for oblation,
<div n="lb"/>cowdung, soil and darbha (grass) for the teacher. He
<div n="lb"/>should receive alms only from the houses of those who
<div n="lb"/>believe in the Vedas and sacrifices. He should not go
<div n="lb"/>to the house of his teacher or his heirs and their families
<div n="lb"/>for alms. Provided there are no other houses he may
<div n="lb"/>receive alms from the houses of his teacher's relatives
<div n="lb"/>and in the absence of such houses he may approach
<div n="lb"/>the houses of heirs to his teacher and in the absence
<div n="lb"/>of such houses he may receive alms from the house of
<div n="lb"/>the teacher. He should fetch ‘Camata’ (fuel chiefly
<div n="lb"/>from butea frondosa) from a place of purity in the
[Page156-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>forest, as instructed in rules and dry it in the sun; in
<div n="lb"/>the absence of which it may be got dried in a sheltered
<div n="lb"/>place. This fuel should be put in the sacrificial fire in
<div n="lb"/>the mornings, at noons, and in the evenings. If a healthy
<div n="lb"/>Brahmacārī fails in doing his duties consecutively for
<div n="lb"/>seven days it will be considered that his vow of Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>carya is broken and then he will have to take the vow
<div n="lb"/>of ‘Avakīrṇi’ again. Without waiting for the order of
<div n="lb"/>the teacher, the Brahmacārī (student) should engage
<div n="lb"/>himself in devotion and meditation and in the service
<div n="lb"/>of the teacher daily. When the student is before the
<div n="lb"/>teacher he should stand with folded hands controlling
<div n="lb"/>his body, speech, brains, sensitive organs, and mind.
<div n="lb"/>Only when he is asked to sit, should he do so before
<div n="lb"/>the teacher, covering the portions of his body, which
<div n="lb"/>are to be covered, with clothes. He should rise up in
<div n="lb"/>the morning before his teacher wakes up, and go to
<div n="lb"/>bed only after the teacher has retired for sleep. When
<div n="lb"/>his teacher calls him, he should not give reply lying,
<div n="lb"/>sitting, walking, eating or looking in the opposite
<div n="lb"/>direction. He should not gainsay the teacher. The
<div n="lb"/>student should attend to the orders of the teacher and
<div n="lb"/>comply with them, sitting if the teacher is sitting,
<div n="lb"/>standing if the teacher is standing, standing back if the
<div n="lb"/>teacher is advancing towards him, running behind if
<div n="lb"/>he is walking, standing close by when he is facing the
<div n="lb"/>opposite direction, folding his limbs when the teacher
<div n="lb"/>is lying or sitting near. The student should have his
<div n="lb"/>seat and bed one step lower than those of his teacher.
<div n="lb"/>The student should not sit in a careless manner in
<div n="lb"/>places where the teacher's eyes could reach. He should
<div n="lb"/>not utter the name of his teacher. If anybody speaks ill
<div n="lb"/>of his teacher he should close his ears and run away
<div n="lb"/>from the spot. If a Brahmacārī scoffs his teacher, he
<div n="lb"/>will be born as a donkey, and as a dog if he scorns him,
<div n="lb"/>and as a worm if he steals the wealth of his teacher
<div n="lb"/>and as a beetle if he becomes jealous at the greatness
<div n="lb"/>of his teacher. When the teacher is angry the brahma-
<div n="lb"/>cārī should not go near him. The Brahmacārī should
<div n="lb"/>not speak unasked. A Brahmacārī could sit with his
<div n="lb"/>teacher only when they are in a vehicle, or on a camel
<div n="lb"/>or in a tower or on the steps or on rocks or in a boat. He
<div n="lb"/>should consider the teacher of his teacher as his teacher.
<div n="lb"/>He should not address his parents who visit the house
<div n="lb"/>of the teacher, without the permission of his teacher. He
<div n="lb"/>should respect learned men, holy men, sons of the
<div n="lb"/>teacher and those who are born of his family, as a
<div n="lb"/>teacher. If the wife of the teacher is of the caste of the
<div n="lb"/>teacher, the brahmacārī should consider her as his
<div n="lb"/>teacher. If the wife is not of the same caste the brahma-
<div n="lb"/>cārī needs only to stand up and make obeisance to her.
<div n="lb"/>A brahmacārī should not apply oil to the body of his
<div n="lb"/>teacher's wife, wash her, massage her body, and comb
<div n="lb"/>her hair. A brahmacārī may either shave his head or
<div n="lb"/>grow matted hair. He should never be asleep at sunrise
<div n="lb"/>or sunset. For learning Vedas etc. the student should not
<div n="lb"/>give the teacher cows, clothes etc. as free gifts before-
<div n="lb"/>hand. On completion of education, when the student
<div n="lb"/>asks the teacher for permission to get married, he should
<div n="lb"/>give the teacher what he demands. A brahmacārī who
<div n="lb"/>has fully complied with the rules mentioned above,
<div n="lb"/>will attain heaven after his death.
