<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got the name Uparicaravasu.%} Once Vasu built
a hermitage and began to perform penance in accord-
ance with the advice of Indra. When the penance
became too severe Indra appeared and gave him an
aerial chariot. Since then Vasu used to travel through
air in the chariot. So he got the name ‘Uparicaravasu’
(Vasu, who travels above). (Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Vasu and Indra festival.%} Indra gave Vasu a garland
(Vaijayantīmālā) which would never fade, and gave a
boon that, so long as he wore that garland, he would
not receive any wound. He was given a bamboo stick
(Veṇudaṇḍa) and was instructed to fix that rod on
the earth and celebrate the festival of Indra. Vasu
celebrated the festival of Indra and from that day on-
wards the festival of Indra came to be celebrated in the
world. (See under Indrotsava).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%The sons of Vasu.%} Five sons named Bṛhadratha,
Kuśāmba (Maṇivāhana), Mavella, Yadu and Rājanya
were born to him.
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Kicking and splitting Kolāhala.%} The river Śukti-
matī flowed through the capital city of Vasu. Once the
great hill Kolāhala grew amorous of Śuktimatī and
caught hold of her. Uparicaravasu got angry at this
and kicked the mountain which was split into two and
Śuktimatī flowed out of the gap. Still two children
were born to the great hill by Śuktimatī. The river
was pleased at the freedom accorded by the king and
placed the two children at the feet of the king. They
grew up. The son became general of the army and the
daughter Girikā became the wife of the king. (M.B.
Ādi Parva Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Vasu goes ahunting.%} One day the king decided to
go to hunt. On the same day his wife had her monthly
course. Still without changing his programme he started
for the forest. Even after entering the forest the thought
of his wife lingered in his mind. The forest was in full
bloom as it was Spring. Seeing this the king grew
amorous and sat under a tree. A mild breeze was blowing.
Instantly the king had seminal flow. He collected the
semen in the leaf of a tree and sent it to the queen
through an eagle. Thinking that to be some food, an-
other eagle got near and a quarrel arose. The semen
fell in the river Yamunā. A fish named Adrikā swall-
owed it. (See under Adrikā). A fisherman caught hat
fish. He got a male child and a female child from the
stomach of the fish. That girl is the famous Satyavatī
Matsyagandhā who became the queen of Śantanu. (See
under Satyavatī). The fisherman gave the boy he got
from the fish to king Uparicaravasu. (M.B. Ādi Parva
Chapter 62).
<div n="NI"/>7). {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 8, Stanza 20, that Uparicaravasu was famous
as a member of the council of Yama.
<div n="NI"/>He was a friend of Indra, a devotee of Viṣṇu and a
righteous and diligent man who loved and esteemed
his father. Because of the grace of Śrī Nārāyaṇa, he
[Page809-b+ 65]
secured an empire. He consecrated everything before
god. Once Indra gave him half of his seat. (M.B.
Śānti Parva, Chapter 355). Because of the grace of
Bhagavān (Lord), Garuḍa made him a traveller of the
sky. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 337, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>(iii). In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 337,
Stanza 38, it is mentioned that finally Uparicaravasu
entered the world of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv). Once a controversy arose between Indra and
the hermits, whether cow-slaughter during sacrifices,
was desirable. At this time Uparicaravasu happened
to come there. As he was a man of truth, he was asked
to make a decision. Uparicaravasu stood on the side
of Indra and gave his opinion in favour of slaughter.
The hermits who were against cow-slaughter got
angry and cursed Uparicaravasu to go down to the
world of Pātāla (netherworld). (Matsya Purāṇa,
Chapter 152).
<div n="NI"/>This story is seen with slight difference in Mahābhārata
Śānti Parva, Chapters 322-324.
