<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got the name Uparicaravasu.%} Once Vasu built
<div n="lb"/>a hermitage and began to perform penance in accord-
<div n="lb"/>ance with the advice of Indra. When the penance
<div n="lb"/>became too severe Indra appeared and gave him an
<div n="lb"/>aerial chariot. Since then Vasu used to travel through
<div n="lb"/>air in the chariot. So he got the name ‘Uparicaravasu’
<div n="lb"/>(Vasu, who travels above). (Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Vasu and Indra festival.%} Indra gave Vasu a garland
<div n="lb"/>(Vaijayantīmālā) which would never fade, and gave a
<div n="lb"/>boon that, so long as he wore that garland, he would
<div n="lb"/>not receive any wound. He was given a bamboo stick
<div n="lb"/>(Veṇudaṇḍa) and was instructed to fix that rod on
<div n="lb"/>the earth and celebrate the festival of Indra. Vasu
<div n="lb"/>celebrated the festival of Indra and from that day on-
<div n="lb"/>wards the festival of Indra came to be celebrated in the
<div n="lb"/>world. (See under Indrotsava).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%The sons of Vasu.%} Five sons named Bṛhadratha,
<div n="lb"/>Kuśāmba (Maṇivāhana), Mavella, Yadu and Rājanya
<div n="lb"/>were born to him.
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Kicking and splitting Kolāhala.%} The river Śukti-
<div n="lb"/>matī flowed through the capital city of Vasu. Once the
<div n="lb"/>great hill Kolāhala grew amorous of Śuktimatī and
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of her. Uparicaravasu got angry at this
<div n="lb"/>and kicked the mountain which was split into two and
<div n="lb"/>Śuktimatī flowed out of the gap. Still two children
<div n="lb"/>were born to the great hill by Śuktimatī. The river
<div n="lb"/>was pleased at the freedom accorded by the king and
<div n="lb"/>placed the two children at the feet of the king. They
<div n="lb"/>grew up. The son became general of the army and the
<div n="lb"/>daughter Girikā became the wife of the king. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva Chapter 63).
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Vasu goes ahunting.%} One day the king decided to
<div n="lb"/>go to hunt. On the same day his wife had her monthly
<div n="lb"/>course. Still without changing his programme he started
<div n="lb"/>for the forest. Even after entering the forest the thought
<div n="lb"/>of his wife lingered in his mind. The forest was in full
<div n="lb"/>bloom as it was Spring. Seeing this the king grew
<div n="lb"/>amorous and sat under a tree. A mild breeze was blowing.
<div n="lb"/>Instantly the king had seminal flow. He collected the
<div n="lb"/>semen in the leaf of a tree and sent it to the queen
<div n="lb"/>through an eagle. Thinking that to be some food, an-
<div n="lb"/>other eagle got near and a quarrel arose. The semen
<div n="lb"/>fell in the river Yamunā. A fish named Adrikā swall-
<div n="lb"/>owed it. (See under Adrikā). A fisherman caught hat
<div n="lb"/>fish. He got a male child and a female child from the
<div n="lb"/>stomach of the fish. That girl is the famous Satyavatī
<div n="lb"/>Matsyagandhā who became the queen of Śantanu. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Satyavatī). The fisherman gave the boy he got
<div n="lb"/>from the fish to king Uparicaravasu. (M.B. Ādi Parva
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 62).
<div n="NI"/>7). {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 8, Stanza 20, that Uparicaravasu was famous
<div n="lb"/>as a member of the council of Yama.
<div n="NI"/>He was a friend of Indra, a devotee of Viṣṇu and a
<div n="lb"/>righteous and diligent man who loved and esteemed
<div n="lb"/>his father. Because of the grace of Śrī Nārāyaṇa, he
[Page809-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>secured an empire. He consecrated everything before
<div n="lb"/>god. Once Indra gave him half of his seat. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 355). Because of the grace of
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān (Lord), Garuḍa made him a traveller of the
<div n="lb"/>sky. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 337, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>(iii). In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 337,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 38, it is mentioned that finally Uparicaravasu
<div n="lb"/>entered the world of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv). Once a controversy arose between Indra and
<div n="lb"/>the hermits, whether cow-slaughter during sacrifices,
<div n="lb"/>was desirable. At this time Uparicaravasu happened
<div n="lb"/>to come there. As he was a man of truth, he was asked
<div n="lb"/>to make a decision. Uparicaravasu stood on the side
<div n="lb"/>of Indra and gave his opinion in favour of slaughter.
<div n="lb"/>The hermits who were against cow-slaughter got
<div n="lb"/>angry and cursed Uparicaravasu to go down to the
<div n="lb"/>world of Pātāla (netherworld). (Matsya Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 152).
<div n="NI"/>This story is seen with slight difference in Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapters 322-324.
