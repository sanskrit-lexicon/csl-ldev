AURVA I¦. (Ūrva, Ūrūja). A fierce saint of the line
<div n="lb"/>of Bhṛgu Maharṣi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu, Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu, Cyavana, Aurva.
<div n="NI"/>Cyavana Maharṣi married Āruṣī, daughter of Manu.
<div n="lb"/>Aurva was her child who was the grandfather of Jamad-
<div n="lb"/>agni and the great grandfather of Paraśurāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} The Preceptors of the Bhṛgu dynasty were the
<div n="lb"/>hereditary gurus of the Kings of Hehaya. Kṛtavīrya a
<div n="lb"/>famous King of the Hehaya dynasty and father of Kār-
<div n="lb"/>tavīryārjuna had his education from a Bhṛgu ṛṣi living
<div n="lb"/>in his āśrama. On competing his education the king
<div n="lb"/>paid lavishly and the Bhṛgus became rich thereafter.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavīrya died and his sons did not very much like the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārgavas (Bhṛgus) becoming rich by the wealth of
<div n="lb"/>their ancestors. Knowing this the Bhṛgus started bury-
<div n="lb"/>ing their wealth under the earth. Once a Kṣatriya
[Page076-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>king forcibly dug out from the house of a Bhṛgu the
<div n="lb"/>wealth he had safely buried and from that day onwards
<div n="lb"/>the Kṣatriyas and the Bhārgavas became enemies. The
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgus were hunted down by the Kṣatriya kings and the
<div n="lb"/>Bhārgavas frightened by this move left their abode and
<div n="lb"/>went and hid in Caves in mountains far away. Among
<div n="lb"/>those who thus fled was Āruṣī, wife of Cyavana. Āruṣī
<div n="lb"/>was pregnant at that time and she hid her ‘Garbha’ in
<div n="lb"/>her thighs while fleeing. A brahmin woman who saw
<div n="lb"/>this went and informed the Kṣatriyas and they imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately went and caught hold of her. Then the thigh
<div n="lb"/>broke and a boy came out of it. Because he was born
<div n="lb"/>from the thighs the boy was named Aurva. (Ūrū=
<div n="lb"/>Thigh and so, born of a thigh). (Chapter 179, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The effulgence of Aurva.%} Aurva was born with fiery
<div n="lb"/>radiance and the sudden effulgence made the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>Kings blind. Frightened they craved for pardon and
<div n="lb"/>praised him. They got back their eyesight then.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Aurva and Baḍavāgni.%} Aurva bore a deep grudge
<div n="lb"/>against the Kṣatriyas who had massacred his fore-
<div n="lb"/>fathers. Aurva started doing rigorous penance and by
<div n="lb"/>the force of his austerities the world started to burn. At
<div n="lb"/>that stage the Pitṛs appeared before him and persuaded
<div n="lb"/>him to withdraw from his penance. Aurva then told
<div n="lb"/>them thus: “Pitṛs, while I was lying in the thigh-womb
<div n="lb"/>of my mother I heard hideous groans from outside and
<div n="lb"/>they were of our mothers when they saw the heads of
<div n="lb"/>our fathers being cut off by the swords of the Kṣatriyas.
<div n="lb"/>Even from the womb itself I nurtured a fierce hatred
<div n="lb"/>towards the Kṣatriyas. No helping hand was raised
<div n="lb"/>before the pitiable wails of our mothers”.
<div n="NI"/>The Pitṛs were astounded at the firmness of the vow of
<div n="lb"/>Aurva and horrified at the thought of what would
<div n="lb"/>happen if the penance was continued. They pleaded
<div n="lb"/>again to cease his austerities and then submitting to
<div n="lb"/>their request Aurva withdrew the fire of his penance
<div n="lb"/>and forced it down into the sea. It is now believed
<div n="lb"/>that this fire taking the shape of a horse-head is still
<div n="lb"/>living underneath the sea vomiting heat at all times.
<div n="lb"/>This fire is called Baḍavāgni. More about this can be
<div n="lb"/>had under the head Baḍavāgni. (Chapter 180, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Aurva and the birth of Sagara.%} Ayodhyā was once
<div n="lb"/>ruled by a celebrated King of Ikṣvāku dynasty named
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu. He had as his wife Yādavī a good natured and
<div n="lb"/>well behaved woman who was a gem among queens.
<div n="lb"/>One day Tālajaṃgha a King of the Hehaya line of
<div n="lb"/>rulers who was then the King of Māhiṣmatī defeated
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu in a battle. Yādavī was then pregnant. Jealous
<div n="lb"/>co-wives poisoned her; Yādavī did not die but the
<div n="lb"/>poison affected the child in the womb.
<div n="NI"/>After the defeat, Subāhu and Yādavī went and stayed
<div n="lb"/>with Aurva in his āśrama. For seven years they lived
<div n="lb"/>there and then Subāhu died. Grief-stricken Yādavī was
<div n="lb"/>about to jump into the funeral pyre and end her life
<div n="lb"/>when Aurva stopped her from the act pointing out that
<div n="lb"/>she was soon to deliver a child. After a few months she
<div n="lb"/>delivered a son and Aurva called him ‘Sagara’ meaning
<div n="lb"/>one with ‘gara’ (poison) in him. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 16, 17).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Aurva and the sister of Garuḍa.%} Garuḍa, son of
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā, had a sister named Sumati. Upamanyu, a sage,
<div n="lb"/>wanted to marry her but neither she nor her relatives
<div n="lb"/>liked it. Enraged at this the sage cursed Sumati saying
[Page077-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>that the brahmin who married her would have his head
<div n="lb"/>burst. The marriage of Sumati thus remained a prob-
<div n="lb"/>lem for her parents. There was a friend of Vinatā, a
<div n="lb"/>sannyāsinī, living in a forest and to find a way to escape
<div n="lb"/>from the curse Vinatā sent Garuḍa to her. The sannyā-
<div n="lb"/>sinī advised Garuḍa to approach Aurva to find a solution
<div n="lb"/>for the problem and Aurva was therefore approached
<div n="lb"/>for advice.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that the people of Ayodhyā came in
<div n="lb"/>search of Subāhu and Yādavī who had left them years
<div n="lb"/>before. When they knew of Subāhu's death they were
<div n="lb"/>plunged in sorrow but were glad to know a son of
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu, Sagara, had grown up to be a successor to
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu. When Garuḍa made Aurva acquainted with
<div n="lb"/>the pitiable tale of his sister Aurva decreed that Sumati
<div n="lb"/>should marry a Kṣatriya instead of a brahmin and thus
<div n="lb"/>tide over the curse. He then asked Sagara to marry
<div n="lb"/>Sumati and blessed them saying that Sagara would one
<div n="lb"/>day become an emperor and perform an Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>yāga. Aurva then sent Sagara along with the people
<div n="lb"/>to Ayodhyā where Sagara after defeating all his enemies
<div n="lb"/>became the emperor of Bhāratavarṣa. (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapters 18-21).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Sagara's sons and how Aurva helped in getting them.%}
<div n="lb"/>Sagara ruled the land for three thousand years. He had
<div n="lb"/>besides Sumati another wife, Keśinī. Both of them bore
<div n="lb"/>no sons for Sagara. Dejected he entrusted the adminis-
<div n="lb"/>tration of the state with his ministers and left for the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Aurva. Aurva blessed them and prophesied
<div n="lb"/>that Keśinī would deliver a son to continue the dynasty
<div n="lb"/>and that Sumati would deliver sixty thousand sons of
<div n="lb"/>no great use at all. Sagara and his wives, returned to
<div n="lb"/>the palace and very soon both his wives became preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant. In due time Keśinī delivered a son who was
<div n="lb"/>named Asamañjas. But Sumati gave birth to a lump of
<div n="lb"/>flesh. Greatly pained the King was about to throw it
<div n="lb"/>away when Aurva appeared there and stopped him from
<div n="lb"/>doing that. He directed him to cut the piece of flesh
<div n="lb"/>into sixty thousand pieces and put one piece each in a
<div n="lb"/>jar of ghee. Every year one prince would be born from
<div n="lb"/>one of them. Thus Sumati got sixty thousand sons.
<div n="lb"/>(Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 92).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Teaching of Aurva.%} In the evening of his life Sagara
<div n="lb"/>went and stayed in the āśrama of Aurva. Aurva gave
<div n="lb"/>him instructions on many a divine subject. He taught
<div n="lb"/>him about the importance of the four āśramas, the
<div n="lb"/>rituals to be practised by the different castes of Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra and many such
<div n="lb"/>other things. Finally Aurva gave Sagara Brahmajñāna.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 8, Aṃśam 3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Aurvāśrama.%} All the Bhārgava ṛṣis together once
<div n="lb"/>stayed in the āśrama of Aurva. Paraśurāma visited the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama one day during that time and paid respects to
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu, Khyāti, wife of Bhṛgu, Cyavana, son of Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>and Aurva, son of Cyavana. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chaptre 63).
