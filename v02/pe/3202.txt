KĀMBOJA I¦. Sudakṣiṇa, the King of the country,
Kāmboja. He was present at Draupadī's svayaṃvara.
In Mahābhārata, Karṇa Parva, Chapter 156 we read
that his younger brother was killed by Arjuna. The
Kings of Kāmboja were all known as Kāmbojas. Long
ago, this country was ruled by a King named Kāmboja.
In Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 166, Verse 77,
we see that this Kāmboja was given a sword by the
King Dhundhumāra. Perhaps it was from this King
Kāmboja that the country came to be called ‘Kāmboja’.
