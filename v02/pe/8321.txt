VIJAYADAŚAMĪ¦. A festival of Indians. As this festival
<div n="lb"/>is celebrated for nine nights from the 1st to the 9th in the
<div n="lb"/>bright lunar fortnight of the month of Kanni (Sep-
<div n="lb"/>tember-October) it is known as Navarātri (Nine nights)
<div n="lb"/>and as it continues up to Daśamī (the tenth night) it
<div n="lb"/>is called Dasra. The Hindus believe that the Vijaya-
<div n="lb"/>daśamī (the victorious tenth) was the day on which
<div n="lb"/>Devī Durgā killed Mahiṣāsura and got victory. So this
<div n="lb"/>day is considered to be a suitable moment to begin the
<div n="lb"/>learning of all the arts which would enable one to carry
<div n="lb"/>on a successful life. Sarasvatī is considered the trans-
<div n="lb"/>figuration of Durgā. As people became less superstiti-
<div n="lb"/>ous, they began to consider the story of killing Mahiṣā-
<div n="lb"/>sura as a metaphorical saying, to mean the killing of
<div n="lb"/>ignorance. So the day of victory of Devī Durgā (the same
<div n="lb"/>as Sarasvatī) is considered to be the auspicious moment
<div n="lb"/>for the beginning of learning. The warrior places his
<div n="lb"/>weapons, the man of literature his books and pen, the
<div n="lb"/>musician his musical instruments, at the feet of Devī and
<div n="lb"/>with devotion and worship receives them back from
<div n="lb"/>Devī on the Vijayadaśamī day at an auspicious
<div n="lb"/>moment.
<div n="NI"/>This is a festival celebrated everywhere in India. In
<div n="lb"/>several native states this festival used to be celebrated
<div n="lb"/>under the sponsorship of the royal family as a State
<div n="lb"/>festival. As it is believed that Mahiṣāsura had lived in
<div n="lb"/>Mysore the celebration of Dasra in that State generally
<div n="lb"/>is on a grand scale. In Kerala, from olden times this
<div n="lb"/>festival was celebrated under the patronage of the Vañci
<div n="lb"/>Royal family.
