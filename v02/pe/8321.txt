VIJAYADAŚAMĪ¦. A festival of Indians. As this festival
is celebrated for nine nights from the 1st to the 9th in the
bright lunar fortnight of the month of Kanni (Sep-
tember-October) it is known as Navarātri (Nine nights)
and as it continues up to Daśamī (the tenth night) it
is called Dasra. The Hindus believe that the Vijaya-
daśamī (the victorious tenth) was the day on which
Devī Durgā killed Mahiṣāsura and got victory. So this
day is considered to be a suitable moment to begin the
learning of all the arts which would enable one to carry
on a successful life. Sarasvatī is considered the trans-
figuration of Durgā. As people became less superstiti-
ous, they began to consider the story of killing Mahiṣā-
sura as a metaphorical saying, to mean the killing of
ignorance. So the day of victory of Devī Durgā (the same
as Sarasvatī) is considered to be the auspicious moment
for the beginning of learning. The warrior places his
weapons, the man of literature his books and pen, the
musician his musical instruments, at the feet of Devī and
with devotion and worship receives them back from
Devī on the Vijayadaśamī day at an auspicious
moment.
<div n="NI"/>This is a festival celebrated everywhere in India. In
several native states this festival used to be celebrated
under the sponsorship of the royal family as a State
festival. As it is believed that Mahiṣāsura had lived in
Mysore the celebration of Dasra in that State generally
is on a grand scale. In Kerala, from olden times this
festival was celebrated under the patronage of the Vañci
Royal family.
