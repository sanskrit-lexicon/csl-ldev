GOVINDADATTA¦. A brahmin of great fame who
<div n="lb"/>resided in Bahusuvarṇaka, a city on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā. His wife was a very pious woman. They
<div n="lb"/>had five children. Once when both the parents were
<div n="lb"/>away from the house a sage called Vaiśvānara came
<div n="lb"/>there but the children did not receive him and treat
