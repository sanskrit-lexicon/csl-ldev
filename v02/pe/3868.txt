KUNTĪ¦ (PṚTHĀ). Wife of King Pāṇḍu and the mother
of the Pāṇḍavas, Kuntī is a noble heroine in the Mahā-
bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Kuntī was the sister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's father
Vasudeva. Her real name was Pṛthā. Vasudeva and
Pṛthā were the children of King Śūrasena of the Yādava
dynasty. King Kuntibhoja was the son of Śūrasena's
sister. He had no issues. Śūrasena had promised to give
the daughter first born to him as the adopted daughter
of Kuntibhoja, and accordingly his first-born daughter
Pṛthā was given to Kuntibhoja, and Kuntī was brought
up in his palace. From that day onwards Pṛthā came to
be known as Kuntī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 111).
<div n="NI"/>Kuntī, Mādrī and Gāndhārī were born from aspects
respectively of the three celestial women Siddhi,
[Page442-b+ 65]
Kṛti and Mati. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 160).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kuntī and the mantra.%} To treat brahmins who came
to the court of Kuntibhoja with worshipful offerings
etc. was the duty of Kuntī. Once sage Durvāsas visited
Kuntibhoja, and as he knew that the sage was easily
annoyed Kuntī was specially deputed for his service,
and she served him to the utmost. One day, to test
Kuntī, he asked her to be ready with his food by the
time he took his bath, and he took practically no time
to return after bath and sit for meals. By that time
Kuntī had managed to cook his food, which she placed
before him in a plate. The food was too hot and steam-
ing, and the sage meaningfully looked at the back of
Kuntī. Realising the meaning of the look, Kuntī turned
her back to the sage for him to place the plate of food
thereon. The sage placed it accordingly on her back
and began eating. Though her back was really burning
she showed no sign of it. Pleased at her behaviour the
sage taught her a mantra and blessed her to the follow-
ing effect.
<div n="NI"/>“Repeating this mantra you invoke whichever Deva you
like and thanks to his favour you will get children.
(Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga 2 and
Bhārata (Malayālam) Chapter 111).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kuntī tested the mantra.%} After the departure of
Durvāsas from the palace, Kuntī developed an irresisti-
ble desire to test the efficacy of the mantra. and one
day she invoked Sun-god with the mantra. Thereupon
Sūrya approached her in the guise of a brahmin youth.
Kuntī got alarmed. Owing to disinclination to become
an unmarried mother Kuntī could not make up her mind
to welcome the brahmin youth. But, Sūrya deva argued
that his coming could not be in vain, and Kuntī had
to yield. She requested Sūrya for a son adorned with
helmet, ear-rings etc. (Vana Parva Chapter 207 Verse
17).
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya assured Kuntī that even though a child was born
to her from him, that will not affect her virginity and
departed. Kuntī delivered a son in due course of time
in secret. She locked up the child in a box and floated
it in the Yamunā. An old charioteer called Adhiratha
picked up the child from the river and brought it up as
though it were his own son. That boy grew up to
become the famous Karṇa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 112).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kuntī's wedding.%} In due course Kuntibhoja cele-
brated Kuntī's Svayaṃvara and she chose King Pāṇḍu
of the lunar dynasty as her husband, and Pāṇḍu took
her to Haṣtināpura in all pomp and glory. (Ādi Parva,
Chapter 112).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kuntī's wedded life.%} Pāṇḍu married another wife also
called Mādrī, and all the three of them led a very
happy life. During one of those days Pāṇḍu went
a hunting in the forest and arrowed to death sage Kin-
dama, who was making love with his wife in the forest,
both of them having assumed the forms of deer. The
sage cursed Pāṇḍu with death the moment he touched
his wives, and grief-stricken at the curse he told his
wives about it and decided to take to Sannyāsa. But,
the wives told him that they would commit suicide in
case he took to Sannyāsa. Ultimately Pāṇḍu went to
Śataśṛṅga with his wives, and there he began the per-
formance of penances.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Pāṇḍu asked his wives to become
mothers by some noble persons. But, Kuntī and Mādrī
did not agree to it. Then Kuntī told Pāṇḍu about the
[Page443-a+ 63]
boon she had got from Durvāsas, and with his per-
mission she bore three sons called Dharmaputra, Bhīma
and Arjuna respectively from the three Devas, Dharma,
Vāyu and Indra. As it had been ordained that the
fourth and fifth children would bring sorrows and pain
to the parents Kuntī satisfied herself with three child-
ren (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122, Verses 77, 78).
<div n="NI"/>But, as Pāṇḍu desired that Mādrī also should have
children by Kunti's mantra she used the remaining
mantra and two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva from the
Aśvinīdevas were born to her.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kuntī widowed.%} During a winter when the forest
was fragrant with flowers, Pāṇḍu forgot all about the
Sage's curse and indulged in sexual joys with Mādrī, and
immediately he expired. Kuntī and Mādrī competed
with each other to end their life in the funeral pyre of
their husband. But, as the sages and other relations
insisted that one of them should live to bring up the
children, Mādrī alone ended her life, and Kuntī returned
to Hastināpura with the five children. (Ādi Parva,
Chapter 125).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kuntī at Hastināpura.%} At Hastināpura differences
cropped up between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas.
Kuntī and the five Pāṇḍavas removed themselves to
the ‘Lac palace’ built at Vāraṇāvata. When the palace
was gutted by fire Kuntī and her sons escaped through
a secret tunnel to the forest, and Bhīma carried the
worn out Kuntī on his shoulders. In the forest the
Rākṣasa woman Hiḍimbī, requested Kuntī to permit
Bhīma to become her husband, and Kuntī advised
Bhīma to beget a child by Hiḍimbī, and thus was born
Ghaṭotkaca. At the city named Ekacakrā, Vyāsa consoled
Kuntī. There the brahmins complained to Kuntī about
the depredations of Bakāsura. Kuntī got Baka killed by
Bhīma and asked the brahmins to keep the matter secret.
On the advice of a brahmin who came there accidental-
ly Kuntī and others visited the Pāñcāla kingdom, and
there Arjuna, having defeated all the Kings present
at Pāñcālī's Svayaṃvara wedded her. The Pāṇḍavas
who returned with Pāñcālī at dusk time were asked by
Kuntī to enjoy that day's bhikṣā (Alms received) to-
gether among themselves. Accordingly Pāñcālī became
the wife of all the five Pāṇḍavas. Vidura, at the court
of the Pāñcāla King saluted Kuntī and presented to her
various varieties of gems. Kuntī and Vidura talked
about the painful incidents of the past, and Vidura
escorted the Pāṇḍavas back to Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna led a solitary life in the forest for one year, and
then returned to Hastināpura with Subhadrā whom he
had married meanwhile. Kuntī received Subhadrā
heartily. In the game of dice with Duryodhana, Dharma-
putra was defeated, and the Pāṇḍavas again started
for their life in the forest. During this period Kuntī
lived in Vidura's house. Meanwhile Śrī Kṛṣṇa one day
visited Kuntī, and she told Kṛṣṇa about the fate of her
sons with tears in her eyes. Duryodhana refused to give
half of the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas, who returned
after twelve years' life in exile in the forest and one
year's life incognito. Śrī Kṛṣṇa prompted the Pāṇḍavas
to war with the Kauravas, and both the parties began
preparations for war. (Ādi Parva, from Chapter 135 to
Sabhā and Vana Parvans and Udyoga Parva, upto
Chapter 137).
[Page443-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>8). {%Kuntī before Karṇa.%} War clouds grew thick and
fast, and Kuntī at Vidura's house got restless. Her
heart trembled at the disasters of war as described by
Vidura. She went alone to the banks of the Gaṅgā
where just then Karṇa was engaged in Japa with his
hands raised and face turned to the east. Kuntī waited
for some time after which they began to talk. With
tears in her eyes Kuntī told Karṇa that he was her
son and implored him to return to the Pāṇḍava side
to which Karṇa replied as follows: “Oh! noble lady,
that is quite impossible. I have vowed to kill Arjuna.
I will not kill the other four Pāṇḍavas. You shall
always have five sons alive. If Arjuna were to be no
more I would be there for you in his stead.”
<div n="NI"/>Kuntī shuddered at those terrible words of Karṇa,
and thus did both of them part with each other.
(Udyoga Parva, Chapters 145 and 146).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Last days of Kuntī.%} The great war ended. Thou-
sands of warriors on the Kaurava side like the mighty
Karṇa were no more. On the Pāṇḍava side also many
were killed. Though the Pāṇḍavas won the war their
hearts no more enjoyed peace or happiness. Kuntī
suffered as though caught in a wild fire. She asked
the Pāṇḍavas to perform the obsequies for Karṇa also.
When she let out the secret that Karṇa was her first-
born child Dharmaputra burst into tears. Kuntī
consoled Subhadrā and Uttarā who were lamenting
over the death of Abhimanyu. She requested Śrī
Kṛṣṇa to cremate the dead son of Uttarā.
<div n="NI"/>Then Kuntī went to Gāndhārī, who stood there bathed
in tears. Grief-stricken, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī
started for the forest. Holding Gāndhārī's hand in hers
Kuntī led the way. The Pāṇḍavas prevented their
mother from going, but she did not yield. She advised
Dharmaputra to have a special eye on Sahadeva, not
to forget Karṇa's name and not to show any dis-
pleasure towards Bhīma and Pāñcālī. But, the
Pāṇḍavas wanted to follow their beloved mother into
the forest. Pāñcālī and Subhadrā stationed themselves
behind Kuntī, who shed copious tears at the sight.
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī, who also felt deeply
pained at the sight tried their best to dissuade Kuntī
from following them to the forest. But, Kuntī consoled
her sons and daughters-in-law by means of sympathetic
words and followed Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī to the
banks of the Gaṅgā, where all of them lived together.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas felt acutely the absence of their mother
at home. They went to the forest and paid their res-
pects to Kuntī on the banks of the Gaṅgā. Kuntī
embraced Sahadeva with tears in her eyes. Though
Yudhiṣṭhira and Sahadeva wanted to stay with Kuntī
in her service she did not allow that. Kuntī, Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra and Gāndhārī performed penance in the forest
near the Gaṅgā, taking food only once in a month.
The three of them died there in a wild fire. (Āśrama-
vāsika Parva, Chapter 37, Verse 31). Their relations
immersed their bones in the Gaṅgā and performed the
necessary obsequies. (Strī, Śānti, Āśramavāsika and
Āśvamedhika Parvans).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Kuntī in Devaloka.%} Kuntī, Mādrī and Pāṇḍu
went to Devaloka. (Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5,
Verse 15).
