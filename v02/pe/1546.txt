CITAL¦. (Termites). Cital has got its own place in the
<div n="lb"/>purāṇas. Devī Bhāgavata has the following story about
<div n="lb"/>the origin of it.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu once looking at the face of Lakṣmī laughed
<div n="lb"/>without any apparent reason. Lakṣmī, thinking that
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu was laughing at her and that he had an eye on
<div n="lb"/>some other woman more beautiful than her lost her
<div n="lb"/>temper and cursed Viṣṇu that his head would be severed
<div n="lb"/>from his body.
<div n="NI"/>No sooner was the curse pronounced than the asuras came
<div n="lb"/>in batches fully armed and challenged Viṣṇu to war.
<div n="lb"/>Single-handed the Lord fought the asuras with one bow.
<div n="lb"/>The fight did not end though it continued for thousands
<div n="lb"/>of years. Viṣṇu felt tired and decided to rest awhile.
<div n="lb"/>He planted one end of the untied bow on the ground,
<div n="lb"/>rested his chin on the other and sat in Padmāsana.
<div n="lb"/>Being very tired the Lord remained asleep for a long
<div n="lb"/>time in this posture.
<div n="NI"/>About this time the devas made preparations to perform
<div n="lb"/>a yajña. All the devas except Mahāviṣṇu attended that
<div n="lb"/>yajña. Since he was the master of yajñas performed for
<div n="lb"/>purposes of the devas they could not begin it in his
<div n="lb"/>absence. So, Brahmā and others went in search
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu to Vaikuṇṭha. But he was not to be found there.
<div n="lb"/>Then Brahmā and others found out with their
<div n="lb"/>eyes of knowledge where Viṣṇu was and they went to
<div n="lb"/>the place where he was sleeping. They waited there
<div n="lb"/>for a long time, yet Viṣṇu did not awake from sleep.
<div n="lb"/>Then Brahmā hit at a plan to awaken Viṣṇu. It was
<div n="lb"/>to create citals (termites) to eat the end of the bow.
<div n="lb"/>When they had eaten away the end of the bow
<div n="lb"/>planted on the ground the cord binding the two ends
<div n="lb"/>of it would break, the bow would straighten up and the
<div n="lb"/>speedy movement of it would awaken Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>According to this plan Brahmā created citals, but his
<div n="lb"/>other plans were not acceptable to the citals. They
<div n="lb"/>argued that the advantage of awakening the Lord from
<div n="lb"/>sleep would go only to the devas, while its sin would
<div n="lb"/>fall upon them.
<div n="NI"/>They argued,
<Poem>Nidrābhaṅgaḥ kathāchedo
<div n="lb"/>Dampatyoḥ prītibhedanam /
<div n="lb"/>Śiśumātṛvibhedaśca
<div n="lb"/>Brahmahatyāsamaṃ smṛtam //</Poem>
<F>*) To disturb one in sleep, to interrupt a story, to separate husband and wife as also mother and child from each other—these things
<div n="lb"/>are tantamount to Brahmahatyā (killing of the brahmin).</F>
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā conceded the justness of this argument and
<div n="lb"/>agreed that, in future, a part of the result of yajñas
<div n="lb"/>shall go to citals. It was after this that havis (sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>offering) which, in the course of being submitted to the
<div n="lb"/>fire falls on the sides of the pit of fire became the share
<div n="lb"/>of citals (termites). This promise of Brahmā pleased the
<div n="lb"/>the citals, and they did as was bidden by Brahmā and
[Page184-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the bow of Viṣṇu straightened up with a terrific sound.
<div n="lb"/>The devas were terror-stricken, the whole universe
<div n="lb"/>shook, the earth experienced a convulsion and the oceans
<div n="lb"/>too were shaken. Moreover, the head of Viṣṇu was
<div n="lb"/>severed from the body, rose high up in the sky and fell
<div n="lb"/>into the sea. Brahmā, Śiva and others opened their eyes
<div n="lb"/>only to find the body of Viṣṇu lying thus without the
<div n="lb"/>head.
<div n="NI"/>This loss of Viṣṇu's head proved to be useful in another
<div n="lb"/>way. Now, Hayagrīva, after securing the boon from
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā that he would be killed only by one with horse's
<div n="lb"/>head, was running rough-shod over the whole earth.
<div n="lb"/>The devas cut off the head of a horse and attached it to
<div n="lb"/>the trunk of Viṣṇu. Thus Viṣṇu came to life again, and
<div n="lb"/>according to his orders the citals gnawed away the cord
<div n="lb"/>of Hayagrīva's bow as a result of which he was killed.
<div n="lb"/>(Devīmāhātmya, Prathma Skandha).
