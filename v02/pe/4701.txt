NALINĪ¦. A branch of the Ganges. When the heavenly
Gaṅgā came down to the earth as a result of the
penance of Bhagīratha, Śiva received it on his head. It
is seen in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 43,
that when the Gaṅgā fell drown from the head of Śiva
it split into seven river-arms called Hlādinī, Pāvanī,
Nalinī, Sucakṣus, Sītā, Sindhu and Gaṅgā. The Ganges
which flows through North India is one of these seven
river-arms.
