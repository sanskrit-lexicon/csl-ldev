JĪMŪTAVĀHANA¦. A Vidyādhara. (demi-god). He was
<div n="lb"/>the son of Jīmūtaketu, who was the ruler of a city
<div n="lb"/>named Kāñcanapura in a valley of the Himālayas. Be-
<div n="lb"/>ing childless he had been sad for a long time. At last
<div n="lb"/>he approached the divine tree Kalpaka (a heavenly tree
<div n="lb"/>that yields every wish) that stood in his garden and
<div n="lb"/>requested it to bless him with a child. Thus a son was
<div n="lb"/>born to him. The famous Jīmūtavāhana was that son.
<div n="lb"/>When Jīmūtavāhana came to know of the divine powers
<div n="lb"/>of the Kalpaka tree, from the ministers, with the per-
<div n="lb"/>mission of his father he went to the Kalpaka tree,
<div n="lb"/>bowed before it and said to it, “Oh noble tree! You have
[Page357-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>granted all the wishes of my forefathers. But I have one
<div n="lb"/>wish. No body should be miserable in the world. So I
<div n="lb"/>wish to give you to the world with that purpose in
<div n="lb"/>view”. Instantly an ethereal voice said from the tree.
<div n="lb"/>“If you are forsaking me I am going away. But I will
<div n="lb"/>fulfil your wish.” Thus according to the wish of Jīmū-
<div n="lb"/>tavāhana the Kalpaka tree shed gold everywhere in the
<div n="lb"/>world and then went to heaven and disappeared. The
<div n="lb"/>earth became wealthy and prosperous. The fame of
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtavāhana spread throughout the three worlds, and
<div n="lb"/>all the Vidyādharas grew jealous of him. As the heavenly
<div n="lb"/>tree Kalpaka, which yielded all the wishes, had return-
<div n="lb"/>ed to heaven, they thought it the most propitious time
<div n="lb"/>and arrayed their army against Jīmūtavāhana. His
<div n="lb"/>father Jīmūtaketu had completed all preparations to
<div n="lb"/>meet the enemy. But Jīmūtavāhana approached his
<div n="lb"/>father and said, “Father ! I am perfectly sure that no
<div n="lb"/>body could defeat you in battle. But see how mean
<div n="lb"/>it is to destroy so many lives and win the country mere-
<div n="lb"/>ly for the pleasures of this fragile body. So let us go
<div n="lb"/>away from here. Leave the kingdom to them.”
<div n="NI"/>Jīmūtaketu, who was pleased at this generous nature
<div n="lb"/>of his son, respected his wish and went with his family
<div n="lb"/>to the Malaya mountain and lived there. Mitrāvasu,
<div n="lb"/>the son of Viśvāvasu, the King of the Siddhas and
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtavāhana became close friends. One day Jīmūta-
<div n="lb"/>vāhana was wandering about in the forest when he saw
<div n="lb"/>in the middle of a garden a temple dedicated to Devī
<div n="lb"/>and a young woman of exquisite beauty, surrounded by
<div n="lb"/>her maids, singing hymns and worshipping Devī. Jīmū-
<div n="lb"/>tavāhana was attracted by her extra-ordinary beauty.
<div n="lb"/>Love budded in her heart also. On enquiry it was
<div n="lb"/>understood that she was Malayavatī, the sister of Mit-
<div n="lb"/>rāvasu. After that both of them engaged in a little talk
<div n="lb"/>of love-making. Hearing her mother calling, Malaya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī instantly went home. Being fallen head-long in
<div n="lb"/>love, Jīmūtavāhana spent the night somehow or other
<div n="lb"/>and at dawn reached the temple with a hermit boy.
<div n="lb"/>While the hermit boy was consoling Jīmūtavāhana
<div n="lb"/>Malayavatī also came there. Jīmūtavāhana and his
<div n="lb"/>friend hid behind a tree. She was alone, and since she
<div n="lb"/>could not bear separation from her lover she decided
<div n="lb"/>to commit suicide and standing at the steps, she said
<div n="lb"/>“Devi ! If it is impossible to get that Jīmūtavāhana as
<div n="lb"/>my husband in this birth, let it be so. But bless me that
<div n="lb"/>I may have my wish granted in the next birth at least”.
<div n="lb"/>Saying this she tied one end of her upper garment on
<div n="lb"/>the tree and tried to commit suicide. Instantly there
<div n="lb"/>was an ethereal voice which said, “Daughter, don't do
<div n="lb"/>such rash things. Jīmūtavāhana will become your hus-
<div n="lb"/>band. He will become the emperor of the Vidyādharas
<div n="lb"/>also.” Jīmūtavāhana-came and untied the knot of the
<div n="lb"/>upper garment with his own hands and saved her from
<div n="lb"/>death. Her maid appeared and said with delight.
<div n="lb"/>“Friend! you are very lucky. Today I heard what prince
<div n="lb"/>Mitrāvasu said to his father Viśvāvasu. Thus he said
<div n="lb"/>‘Father! Jīmūtavāhana who gave away his own Kal-
<div n="lb"/>paka tree for the welfare of others has come to this place.
<div n="lb"/>It will bring prosperity to us, if we show our hospitality
<div n="lb"/>to this noble guest by giving our Malayavatī to him. It
<div n="lb"/>is very difficult to get such a noble man for my sister
<div n="lb"/>anywhere else.” The father consented. The prince ins-
<div n="lb"/>tantly went to the abode of this gentleman. I think the
<div n="lb"/>marriage will take place today. So come, let us go
<div n="lb"/>home.”
[Page357-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>With his heart overflowing with joy, Jīmūtavāhana
<div n="lb"/>went to his house. Mitrāvasu was there. He revealed
<div n="lb"/>the purpose of his coming. Jīmūtavāhana, who had the
<div n="lb"/>remembrance of his previous births told Mitrāvasu that
<div n="lb"/>in the previous birth also they had been friends and
<div n="lb"/>that Malayavatī had been his wife. Thus their marriage
<div n="lb"/>took place. Delightful days of the married life passed
<div n="lb"/>one by one. One day Jīmūtavāhana and Mitrāvasu
<div n="lb"/>went for a walk. They reached a forest on the seashore.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing some bones there Jīmūtavāhana asked Mitrā-
<div n="lb"/>vasu about them. Mitrāvasu said: “In ancient days
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū, the mother of Nāgas (serpents) made Vinatā,
<div n="lb"/>the mother of Garuḍa, her slave by some trick. Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>liberated his mother from slavery. But the hatred
<div n="lb"/>increased day by day and Garuḍa began to eat serpents,
<div n="lb"/>the children of Kadrū. Seeing this, Vāsuki the King
<div n="lb"/>of Nāgas entered into a contract with Garuḍa, so as to
<div n="lb"/>prevent the nāgas from being destroyed altogether. The
<div n="lb"/>arrangement was that Vāsuki would send a serpent
<div n="lb"/>everyday to Garuḍa. Garuḍa ate all those serpents
<div n="lb"/>sent by Vāsuki in this place. These are the bones of
<div n="lb"/>those poor snakes.”
<div n="NI"/>When Jīmūtavāhana heard this story his heart was
<div n="lb"/>filled with pity. He decided to save the life of at least
<div n="lb"/>one serpent by giving his body instead. But the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Mitrāvasu was an obstacle to carry out
<div n="lb"/>his wish. At that particular moment a minister of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāvasu appeared there and took away Mitrāvasu
<div n="lb"/>saying that he was wanted by his father. Left alone,
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtavāhana stood there when he saw a young man
<div n="lb"/>coming with an old woman who was crying bitterly.
<div n="lb"/>On enquiry Jtmūtavāhana learned that in accordance
<div n="lb"/>with the agreement with Garuḍa, the old woman was
<div n="lb"/>bringing her only son Śaṅkhacūḍa to give him as food
<div n="lb"/>to Garuḍa. Jīmūtavāhana told them that he would
<div n="lb"/>take the place of Śaṅkhacūḍa that day. The mother
<div n="lb"/>and the son reluctantly agreed to his desire. The old
<div n="lb"/>woman went away crying and Śaṅkhacūḍa went to the
<div n="lb"/>temple.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the sound of Garuḍa's wings Jīmūtavāhana
<div n="lb"/>laid himself on a stone and Garuḍa taking him in his
<div n="lb"/>beaks flew to the top of the Malaya Mountain. On the
<div n="lb"/>way the jewel of Jīmūtavāhana known as ‘Cūḍāratna’,
<div n="lb"/>which was soaked in blood fell down, in front of
<div n="lb"/>Malayavatī. Knowing that it was the jewel of her
<div n="lb"/>husband, with a terrible cry she ran to her father.
<div n="lb"/>Because of his knowledge of arts and sciences,
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtaketu also knew everything and with his wife and
<div n="lb"/>daughter he went to the top of the Malaya mountain.
<div n="NI"/>In the meanwhile, Śaṅkhacūḍa, having done obeisance
<div n="lb"/>to ‘Gokarṇanātha’ (God), came back to the stone
<div n="lb"/>where he had left Jīmūtavāhana and seeing a pool of
<div n="lb"/>fresh blood, became sad and silent. Then determining
<div n="lb"/>that he would save Jīmūtavāhana at any cost, he
<div n="lb"/>went up the mountain following the track of the blood
<div n="lb"/>drops.
<div n="NI"/>Garuḍa took Jīmūtavāhana to the peak of the mountain
<div n="lb"/>and began to peck at him. Jīmūtavāhana grew more
<div n="lb"/>and more delightful as the pecking became harder.
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa looked at him with wonder and thought,
<div n="lb"/>“Surely, this is not a nāga. It must be a Gandharva or
<div n="lb"/>somebody else.” Not knowing what to do he sat looking
<div n="lb"/>at his prey, who invited him to finish off his meal. By
<div n="lb"/>this time Śaṅkhacūḍa had reached the spot. Soon
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtaketu with his wife and Malayavatī also arrived.
[Page358-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>They all cried aloud. Garuḍa was in great confusion.
<div n="lb"/>When he knew that he was about to eat the famous
<div n="lb"/>Jīmūtavāhana, who had given away even the Kalpaka
<div n="lb"/>tree for the good of others, Garuḍa was filled with
<div n="lb"/>remorse. Instantly Jīmūtavāhana died. The parents
<div n="lb"/>and Śaṅkhacūḍa cried beating their breasts. Malayavatī
<div n="lb"/>fell on the ground and cried. Then looking up she
<div n="lb"/>called out with tears. “Ha ! Devi ! Jagadambikā ! you
<div n="lb"/>have told me that my husband would become the
<div n="lb"/>emperor of the Vidyādharas. Has your boon become
<div n="lb"/>futile because of my misfortune?” Devī appeared and
<div n="lb"/>said “Daughter ! My words will not become futile.”
<div n="lb"/>Then Devī sprinkled Amṛta (ambrosia) on Jīmūta-
<div n="lb"/>vāhana and brought him to life. He sprang up more
<div n="lb"/>radiant than before, and was anointed as emperor
<div n="lb"/>of the Vidyādharas by Devī. When Devī disappeared
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa who was much pleased, told Jīmūtavāhana
<div n="lb"/>to ask for any boon.
<div n="NI"/>Jīmūtavāhana requested for the boon that Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>should stop eating the Nāgas and that all the serpents
<div n="lb"/>who had been reduced to bones should be brought to
<div n="lb"/>life again. Garuḍa granted him that boon. All the
<div n="lb"/>serpents which had been killed by Garuḍa came to
<div n="lb"/>life again. All the gods and hermits came there with
<div n="lb"/>joy. After all had gone, Jīmūtavāhana went with his
<div n="lb"/>relatives to the Himālayas as the emperor of Vidyā-
<div n="lb"/>dharas.
