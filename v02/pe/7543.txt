TIMIDHVAJA¦. A demon who was ruling in the state
<div n="lb"/>of Vaijayantapura. He was called Śambara also. This
<div n="lb"/>demon once attacked Devaloka. Indra was not able
<div n="lb"/>to kill him. So he sought the help of Dasaratha.
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha went and fought against the demons.
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha was made to faint in the battlefield by the
<div n="lb"/>magic of Timidhvaja and Kaikeyī who was there then,
<div n="lb"/>took him away and gave him all first aid. Pleased at
<div n="lb"/>this Daśaratha promised two boons for her and it was
<div n="lb"/>these boons that Kaikeyī demanded of Daśaratha on
<div n="lb"/>the advice of Mantharā at the time of the coronation
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Rāma. (Sarga 9, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
