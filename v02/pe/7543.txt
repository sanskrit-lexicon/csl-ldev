TIMIDHVAJA¦. A demon who was ruling in the state
of Vaijayantapura. He was called Śambara also. This
demon once attacked Devaloka. Indra was not able
to kill him. So he sought the help of Dasaratha.
Daśaratha went and fought against the demons.
Daśaratha was made to faint in the battlefield by the
magic of Timidhvaja and Kaikeyī who was there then,
took him away and gave him all first aid. Pleased at
this Daśaratha promised two boons for her and it was
these boons that Kaikeyī demanded of Daśaratha on
the advice of Mantharā at the time of the coronation
of Śrī Rāma. (Sarga 9, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa).
