UÑCHAVṚTTI¦. A brahmin. His story is told as follows
<div n="lb"/>in Jaimini Aśvamedha Parva.
<div n="NI"/>This poor brahmin who lived by begging got one day
<div n="lb"/>some food grain powder. After offering a portion of it
<div n="lb"/>to Agni and Brahmins, he divided the balance equally
<div n="lb"/>between the children. Then he sat down to take his own
<div n="lb"/>food when Dharmadeva, disguised as a brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>appeared and demanded food. Uñchavṛtti gave all his
<div n="lb"/>food to the guest. Since that did not satisfy the guest,
<div n="lb"/>the sons also gave their shares of the food to him. Great-
<div n="lb"/>ly pleased at the noble act of Uñchavṛtti, Dharmadeva
<div n="lb"/>took the brahmin family with him to Svargaloka. One
<div n="lb"/>day a few particles of the foodgrain powder which re-
<div n="lb"/>mained with the brahmin fell on the earth. A mongoose
<div n="lb"/>came and played on that ground. That part of his body
<div n="lb"/>which got smeared with the food-grain powder became
<div n="lb"/>golden in colour. Though the mongoose went to the
<div n="lb"/>yajña ground of Dharmadeva and repeated the above
<div n="lb"/>process there, the remaining portion of its body did not
<div n="lb"/>become golden.
