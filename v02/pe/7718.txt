UÑCHAVṚTTI¦. A brahmin. His story is told as follows
in Jaimini Aśvamedha Parva.
<div n="NI"/>This poor brahmin who lived by begging got one day
some food grain powder. After offering a portion of it
to Agni and Brahmins, he divided the balance equally
between the children. Then he sat down to take his own
food when Dharmadeva, disguised as a brahmin,
appeared and demanded food. Uñchavṛtti gave all his
food to the guest. Since that did not satisfy the guest,
the sons also gave their shares of the food to him. Great-
ly pleased at the noble act of Uñchavṛtti, Dharmadeva
took the brahmin family with him to Svargaloka. One
day a few particles of the foodgrain powder which re-
mained with the brahmin fell on the earth. A mongoose
came and played on that ground. That part of his body
which got smeared with the food-grain powder became
golden in colour. Though the mongoose went to the
yajña ground of Dharmadeva and repeated the above
process there, the remaining portion of its body did not
become golden.
