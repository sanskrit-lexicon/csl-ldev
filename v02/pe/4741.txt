NARA I¦. A hermit of divine power.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Brahmā created Dharmadeva from his
breast. Truthful and righteous Dharma married ten
daughters of Dakṣa. Several sons were born to Dharma
of his ten wives. But foremost among them were Hari,
Kṛṣṇa, Nara and Nārāyaṇa. Hari and Kṛṣṇa became
great yogins and Nara and Nārāyaṇa became great
hermits of penance. The Nara-Nārāyaṇas lived in the
holy Asylum of Badarikāśrama in the vicinity of the
Himālayas for a thousand years performing penance to
Brahmā. (Devī Bhāgavata. Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Giving birth to Urvaśī.%} See under Urva ī, Para 1.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Keeper of Amṛta (Ambrosia).%} The Devas (gods) and
the asuras (demons) together churned the sea of milk
and obtained Ambrosia (the celestial nectar of immortal-
ity). Mahāviṣṇu took the guise of a fascinating woman
and obtained the Amṛta by stealth from the asuras
and gave it to the devas. The asuras waged a terrible
war with the devas. At that time, at the request of
the devas, Nara and Nārāyaṇa took sides with the
devas, and fought against the asuras as a consequence
of which the asuras were defeated. In Mahābhārata,
Ādi Parva, Chapter 19, Stanza 31, it is stated that
from that day onwards Indra entrusted the keeping
of the celestial Nectar with the hermit named Nara.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Dambhodbhava brought under control.%} See under
Dambhodbhava).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Conflict with Śiva.%} Because he was not invited to the
sacrifice by Dakṣa, Śiva got angry and sent his trident
against Dakṣa's sacrifice. The trident completely des-
troyed the sacrifice and flew through the air here and
there. Then it reached Badaryāśrama and hit the breast
of Nārāyaṇa who was sitting engaged in penance. By
[Page525-b+ 65]
the force of the utterance of the sound ‘Hum’, made
by Nārāyaṇa, the trident was ejected from his breast.
Finding no accommodation there it flew back to Śiva,
who getting angry at this rebut approached Nara-
Nārāyaṇas with the intention of exterminating them.
Nara took a grass from the ground and discharged it at
Śiva. Instantly the grass became an axe. It flew round
Śiva to attack him. Śiva broke the axe. From that day
onwards Śiva got the name ‘Khaṇḍaparaśu’ (one who
broke the axe). In this story it is said that the trident
which had returned from the breast of Nārāyaṇa heated
the hair of Śiva to such an extent that they were
dried as dry grass. So Śiva came to be called ‘Muñja-
keśa’ (with hair having the colour of dry grass). (M.B.
Śānti Parva, Chapter 343).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Fight with Prahlāda.%} Once Cyavana the son of Bhṛgu
went to Nākuleśvara tīrtha (Bath) to take his bath in
the river Narmadā. As soon as he got into the water
the serpent called Kekaralohita caught hold of him.
Cyavana meditated on Viṣṇu. So the poison of the ser-
pent did not affect him. The huge serpent dragged
Cyavana to Pātāla (the Nether world). But as his
poison did not affect the hermit the serpent left the
prey and went away. The Nāga damsels welcomed
him and showed hospitality. Being greeted by the Nāga
damsels he travelled through Pātāla and reached the
great city of Dānavas. The asura chiefs greeted him with
respect. Prahlāda met Cyavana, and received him with
pleasure. The hermit said to Prahlāda. “I came to bathe
in the Mahātīrtha and worship Nākuleśvara. When I
got into the river a serpent caught hold of me and
brought me to Pātāla, and made it possible for me to
meet you.” Hearing these words of Cyavana the King
of the asuras said: “Oh good Lord! which are the holy
baths in the earth, the sky and the Pātāla? Would you
be pleased to tell us?” Cyavana replied: “Oh! power-
ful and mighty King! The holy baths are Naimiṣa on
the earth, Puṣkara on the sky and Cakra tīrtha in Pātāla;
these are the most important ones.”
<div n="NI"/>The King of the Daityas decided to go to Naimiṣa and
said:—“We must go and bathe in the Naimiṣa tīrtha.
We could visit and worship Viṣṇu with eyes as beautiful
as lotus.” Obeying the words of the King, preparations
were made instantly and the asuras started from Rasā-
tala for Naimiṣa.
<div n="NI"/>The mighty host of Daityas and Dānavas reached
Naimiṣa and bathed in the tīrtha. After that Prahlāda
went to the forest for hunting. As he was walking thus
he saw the river Sarasvatī. Near the river there was a
Pine tree with very big branches, all of which were
covered with arrows, the head of one at the tail of ano-
ther. Prahlāda saw near the tree two hermits, with
matted hair, clad in the hide of black antelope, perform-
ing penance. Near them were two perfectly made divine
bows named Śārṅga and Ajagava and two quivers which
would never become empty. Prahlāda questioned them
without knowing that they were Nara and Nārāyaṇa.
The questioning ended in a contest. The hermit Nara
stood up and taking the bow Ajagava began sending
showers of arrows at Prahlāda. Prahlāda checked every
one of them. The hermit made his fight more severe.
Prahlāda also withstood it. At last pushing Nara back
Nārāyaṇa came to the front. The fight between Prahlāda
and Nārāyaṇa was fierce. In the end Prahlāda fell down,
his breast being pierced by the arrow of Nārāyaṇa.
[Page526-a+ 64]
Prahlāda realized that the hermit Nārāyaṇa was none
but Viṣṇu. He praised Nārāyaṇa (Vāmana Purāṇa,
Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) On the occasion of the stripping of Pāñcālī of her
clothes at the palace of the Kauravas, Pāñcālī cried,
calling Nara and Nārāyaṇa. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 68, Stanza 46).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa were the rebirths of Nara
and Nārāyaṇa. (See under Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter
334, Stanza 9, that the hermit Nara was one of the
four incarnations taken by Mahāviṣṇu in the Manuṣya
yuga (age of man) of the Svāyambhuva Manvantara.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) It is mentioned in Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa,
Chapter 2, that, of the two viz. Nara and Nārāyaṇa,
Nara was of fair complexion and Nārāyaṇa of dark
complexion.
<div n="NI"/>(v) It was because of the curse of the hermit Bhṛgu
that Nara-Nārāyaṇas took birth as Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa
in the Dvāparayuga. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) The meaning of the word ‘Nara’ is he who is not
damaged. The universal soul named Nara has created
water and so water got the name ‘Nāram’. Because he
lives in that water which has the name Nāram, the uni-
versal soul got the name Nārāyaṇa. (Manusmṛti, Chapter
1 Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) For the other incarnations of Nara see under
Raktaja.
