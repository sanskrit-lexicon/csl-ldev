PRAHETI I¦. A demon. Once Brahmā, the creator,
<div n="lb"/>became hungry and in his anger he produced some
[Page595-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sounds which became Rākṣasas and Yakṣas. When
<div n="lb"/>one said “Rakṣāmahe” the rākṣasas (demons) came
<div n="lb"/>into being and when the other said ‘Yakṣāmahe’ the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas came into being. It was Praheti who became
<div n="lb"/>the father of the rākṣasas and Heti, the father of the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas. Both of them became mighty and powerful
<div n="lb"/>like Madhu and Kaiṭabha. Of these Praheti knew that
<div n="lb"/>only by virtuous life could one attain happiness in the
<div n="lb"/>next world and so remaining unmarried went to the
<div n="lb"/>valley of the Himālayas and doing penance there
<div n="lb"/>attained mokṣa. Heti when he came of age married
<div n="lb"/>Bhayā, sister of Kāla, and got a son named Vidyutkeśa.
<div n="lb"/>Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of Sandhyā.
<div n="lb"/>The rākṣasa race born of them lived in Pātāla and
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā. In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle all were killed.
