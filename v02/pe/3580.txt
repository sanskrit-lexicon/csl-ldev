KOLIKA¦ (KOKILA). This is the name of a rat. Kokila
<div n="lb"/>is a character in the story known as Biḍālopākhyāna,
<div n="lb"/>told by Nārada to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Once a cat began to
<div n="lb"/>perform penance holding up both of its hands, on the
<div n="lb"/>bank of the Gaṅgā. After a long time birds and rats
<div n="lb"/>began to come very close to it believing that it would
<div n="lb"/>not hurt them. They made the cat their leader. The
<div n="lb"/>wicked cat daily ate a rat secretly. Thus the body of
<div n="lb"/>the cat grew stronger day by day and there appeared a
<div n="lb"/>steady decrease in the number of the rats. Among them
<div n="lb"/>there was a wise rat called Kokila. He understood the
<div n="lb"/>deceit played by the cat. So proclaiming independence
<div n="lb"/>he and his fellows ran away and saved themselves.
