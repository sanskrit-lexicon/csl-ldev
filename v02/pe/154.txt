in the Verses 19 to 26 in the 2nd Chapter of Ādi Parva of
the Malayalam Mahābhārata. It says thus: One chariot,
one elephant, three horses and five soldiers constitute
what is termed a Patti. Three such pattis make one Senā-
mukha and three such senāmukhas make one Gulma.
Three gulmas make one Gaṇa and three such gaṇas
make one Vāhinī. Three such vāhinīs make one Pṛtanā.
