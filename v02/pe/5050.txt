PARĪKṢIT I¦. A brilliant King of Candravaṃśa. He
was the grandson of Arjuna and son of Abhimanyu.
(For genealogy see under Abhimanyu).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Parīkṣit was the son born to Abhimanyu of
Uttarā. This was a still-born child and it was Śrī
Kṛṣṇa who gave it life. There is a story in Mahā-
bhārata about this:
<div n="NI"/>Uttarā, wife of Abhimanyu, was pregnant when the
war between the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas started at
Kurukṣetra. Aśvatthāmā, son of Droṇa, entered the
camp of the Pāṇḍavas at night and slew Dhṛṣṭadyumna.
He then sent the most fierce Brahmaśirāstra (missile of
Brahmaśira) to exterminate the Pāṇḍavas. To face it
and oppose it Arjuna also sent an equally fierce
Brahmaśirāstra. The sight of two such powerful weapons
opposing each other made all the sages anxious and
they led by Vyāsa entered the field and requested them
to withdraw their missiles. It was in vain. The missile
of Aśvatthāmā went and struck the womb of Uttarā.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the Pāṇḍavas after their exile were
staying in the village of Upaplavya a brahmin had
predicted to Uttarā that at the fag end of the life of
the Pāṇḍavas Uttarā would bear a son who would be
tested even while in her womb and that the child
should be named Parīkṣit. (Parīkṣā = test).
<div n="NI"/>The child in the womb died when the missile struck it.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa was greatly agitated by this wicked act of
Aśvatthāmā and he said thus: “Oh Aśvatthāmā, the
child now dead in its womb would surely come to life
again. You will be called a sinner because of this in-
fanticide. Because of this you will roam about on earth
for three thousand years and during that time nobody
would mingle with you. You will not get a seat any-
where. All diseases will find an abode in your body.
But this infant would grow up into a king and rule the
country for sixty years. He would become celebrated
as the next Kururāja.” (Sauptika Parva, Mahābhārata)
When the Bhāratayuddha came to an end Dharmaputra
performed an aśvamedhayāga. Many prominent per-
sons including Śrī Kṛṣṇa assembled at Hastināpura for
this purpose. Vidura received them all. At that time
they were informed that Uttarā had delivered a still-
born child. Parīkṣit was born when the embryo was
only six months old (Śloka 82, Chapter 85, Ādi
Parva). Everybody assembled there was sad and dep-
ressed when he heard this news. Śrī Kṛṣṇa went in and
saw the dead infant. Uttarā wept bitterly and every-
body asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa to give life to the infant somehow.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa did so and the child was named Parīkṣit
remembering the prophetic words of the brāhmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Marriage.%} Parīkṣit married a princess named Mādra-
vatī and got of her four sons named Janamejaya, Śruta-
[Page573-a+ 65]
sena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena. Chapters 3, 4, 5, Ādi
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Curse of a sage.%} Parīkṣit was greatly interested in
hunting. Once he went to a big forest with his large
retinue to hunt. While hunting he followed a deer
which the king had struck with his arrow and he sepa-
rated from the rest and went a long way deep into the
forest. It was midday and the king was tired. Then he
saw a sage sitting there and the king went in and asked
him about the deer. The sage engrossed in his medita-
tion did not hear that. The king mistook his silence to
be arrogance and taking the dead body of a cobra lying
nearby with the tip of his bow threw it round the neck
of the sage and went his way. The sage did not know
even that. The king returned to the palace after the
hunting.
<div n="NI"/>The sage had a son named Gavijāta (In many places
the name Śṛṅgī is used for Gavijāta). He was playing
with the sons of other sages. One munikumāra (son of
a sage) said, “Oh Gavijāta, your father is equal to Śiva.
Both have a serpent round their necks. But there is only
one difference. The serpent round your father's neck
is a dead one.” Gavijāta was greatly disturbed by this
jeer and he immediately went to the āśrama to make
enquiries. When he knew that an unknown person had
done that foul deed he took water in his hand and said
“Whoever be the person who put this dead snake round
the neck of my father will die being bitten by the fierce
cobra Takṣaka within seven days.” Only after pronounc-
ing this horrible curse did he find out that the perpet-
rator of that crime was none other than the most noble
and charitable king, Parīkṣit. Gavijāta repented greatly
and immediately sent word to the king about his curse
through Gauramukha, a munikumāra. The king was a
bit frightened first but then he started thinking about
the way to escape from the curse. (Chapter 40, Ādi
Parva, and 2nd Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4.) {%Takṣaka gets ready.%} As soon as the messenger Gaura-
mukha departed from the palace Parīkṣit called the
ministers to his side and conferred with them to find a
way to escape from the cobra Takṣaka. They built a
building on a huge pillar and gave all protections to
the building. Brahmins well-versed in all the mantras
and Viṣavaidyas (physicians in the treatment of snake-
poisoning) of fame were asked to sit around the pillar
and the place was well-guarded. The King sat in a
room tightly closed. Six days went by. On the seventh
day the celebrated Viṣavaidya Ka yapamaharṣi was on
his way to the palace at the summons of the king.
Takṣaka was also on his way to the palace in the guise
of a brahmin. They met on the way and though
Kaśyapa did not know him first Takṣaka introduced
himself when he knew that Kaśyapa was going to the
palace to treat the king if anything happened. He said
“Oh Kaśyapa, I am Takṣaka and none of your wits
would be able to fight against the effects of my poison.
If you want to know it we shall make a trial.” Saying
so Takṣaka went and bit a big banyan tree standing
nearby, and lo! the whole tree was burnt to ashes by
the strength of the poison. Kaśyapa smilingly recited
the Viṣahāri mantra and sprinkled some water on the
ashes and lo! the tree stood in its place again with not
a single mutilation anywhere. Takṣaka was astounded.
He then bribed Kaśyapa. He said he would give him
more than what could be expected of the king and
[Page573-b+ 64]
requested him to return home. Kaśyapa returned and
Takṣaka went to the palace.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death of Parīkṣit.%} Takṣaka went and inspected the
palace of Parīkṣit. There was no way to step in and
Takṣaka was astonished at the perfect protection given
to the king. Takṣaka called all his relatives to his side
and asked them to go to the King in the guise of
brahmins carrying several kinds of fruits as presents.
Takṣaka crept inside a beautiful fruit in the shape of a
worm and was carried along with the fruits taken to
the king. The servants of the king took the fruits
brought by the brahmins to the king and the king struck
by the size and beauty of a fruit among them took it and
cut it open. He saw a worm inside red in colour with
two black spots as eyes. The king took it in his hand and
at that instant it changed into Takṣaka and bit the king.
After that it rose up into the air and disappeared. (Cha-
pters 42 to 49, Ādi Parva and 2nd Skandha, Devī
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Parīkṣit as a king.%} Many researches have been made
to fix the period of the reign of Parīkṣit.
“Saptarṣayo maghāyuktāḥ
Kale Pārikṣite sbhavan //
(Chapter 271, Matsya Purāṇa),
“Te tu Pārikṣite kāle
Maghāsvāsan dvijottamāḥ”
(Chapter 24, Aṃśa 4, Viṣṇu Purāṇa)
Following these statements in the Purāṇas, astrono-
mers and astrologers searched for the year or years in
which the Saptarṣi maṇḍala (the constellation of a
group of seven stars) and the month of māgha came into
the same zodiac. It came in B.C. 3077 and then in B.C. 477.
This would again occur in 2223 A.D. Parīkṣit, according
to other facts, also must have lived in B.C. 3077.
<div n="NI"/>Pāṇḍavas went for their mahāprasthāna after entrusting
the administration to the care of Parīkṣit. The Mahā-
bhārata battle was fought in the year 3138 B.C.
Dharmaputra ruled for 36 years and so Parīkṣit must
have taken charge of the administration in 3102 B.C.
Parīkṣit ruled for 60 years and his son Janamejaya be-
came king in 3042 B.C. It was this Janamejaya who
conducted the famous Sarpasatra.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Parīkṣit attained Svarga.%} Parīkṣit did not enter heaven
as soon as he died. So Janamejaya at the advice of Nārada
conducted a yāga called Ambāyāga for the salvation of
the spirit of his father. It was during the navarātri
period that this was done. Many eminent sages took
part in the ceremony. All were received well and given
gifts in plenty. He made pure brahmins read the
Devībhāgavata with devotion in the presence of the
deity to please Jagadambikā (mother goddess), queen
of all queens (Rājarāje varī). When it was over, a
divine brilliance like burning fire was visible in the sky
and Nārada appeared before Janamejaya and said “Oh
Janamejaya, King of Kings, your father was lying bound
by the shackles of his life on earth. But today he
acquired a divine form and wearing divine apparels and
ornaments went to the divine seat of Devī in a sacred
Vimāna from Indrapura while Indra, devas and the
celestial maidens stood praising him (Skandha 12, Devī
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Parīkṣit ruled the country for sixty years, with all
virtues and goodness. (Chapter 49, Ādi Parva).
[Page574-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) After the great battle, one day at the request of a
few, Vyāsa by his yogic powers arrayed all the dead
great ones of the Pāṇḍava-Kaurava company. Parīkṣit
was also called then to the Gaṅgā where it was arranged
and Janamejaya who was present to witness the show
then gave an Avabhṛtasnāna (ablution after a sacrifice)
to his father. Parīkṣit disappeared after that. (Chapter
35, Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The synonyms of Parīkṣit are (1) Abhimanyusuta
(2) Bhārataśreṣṭha (3) Kirīṭitanayātmaja (4) Kuru-
śreṣṭha (5) Kurunandana (6) Kururāja (7) Kuru-
vardhana (8) Pāṇḍaveya.
