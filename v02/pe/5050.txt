PARĪKṢIT I¦. A brilliant King of Candravaṃśa. He
<div n="lb"/>was the grandson of Arjuna and son of Abhimanyu.
<div n="lb"/>(For genealogy see under Abhimanyu).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Parīkṣit was the son born to Abhimanyu of
<div n="lb"/>Uttarā. This was a still-born child and it was Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa who gave it life. There is a story in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata about this:
<div n="NI"/>Uttarā, wife of Abhimanyu, was pregnant when the
<div n="lb"/>war between the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas started at
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra. Aśvatthāmā, son of Droṇa, entered the
<div n="lb"/>camp of the Pāṇḍavas at night and slew Dhṛṣṭadyumna.
<div n="lb"/>He then sent the most fierce Brahmaśirāstra (missile of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaśira) to exterminate the Pāṇḍavas. To face it
<div n="lb"/>and oppose it Arjuna also sent an equally fierce
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaśirāstra. The sight of two such powerful weapons
<div n="lb"/>opposing each other made all the sages anxious and
<div n="lb"/>they led by Vyāsa entered the field and requested them
<div n="lb"/>to withdraw their missiles. It was in vain. The missile
<div n="lb"/>of Aśvatthāmā went and struck the womb of Uttarā.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the Pāṇḍavas after their exile were
<div n="lb"/>staying in the village of Upaplavya a brahmin had
<div n="lb"/>predicted to Uttarā that at the fag end of the life of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas Uttarā would bear a son who would be
<div n="lb"/>tested even while in her womb and that the child
<div n="lb"/>should be named Parīkṣit. (Parīkṣā = test).
<div n="NI"/>The child in the womb died when the missile struck it.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa was greatly agitated by this wicked act of
<div n="lb"/>Aśvatthāmā and he said thus: “Oh Aśvatthāmā, the
<div n="lb"/>child now dead in its womb would surely come to life
<div n="lb"/>again. You will be called a sinner because of this in-
<div n="lb"/>fanticide. Because of this you will roam about on earth
<div n="lb"/>for three thousand years and during that time nobody
<div n="lb"/>would mingle with you. You will not get a seat any-
<div n="lb"/>where. All diseases will find an abode in your body.
<div n="lb"/>But this infant would grow up into a king and rule the
<div n="lb"/>country for sixty years. He would become celebrated
<div n="lb"/>as the next Kururāja.” (Sauptika Parva, Mahābhārata)
<div n="lb"/>When the Bhāratayuddha came to an end Dharmaputra
<div n="lb"/>performed an aśvamedhayāga. Many prominent per-
<div n="lb"/>sons including Śrī Kṛṣṇa assembled at Hastināpura for
<div n="lb"/>this purpose. Vidura received them all. At that time
<div n="lb"/>they were informed that Uttarā had delivered a still-
<div n="lb"/>born child. Parīkṣit was born when the embryo was
<div n="lb"/>only six months old (Śloka 82, Chapter 85, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva). Everybody assembled there was sad and dep-
<div n="lb"/>ressed when he heard this news. Śrī Kṛṣṇa went in and
<div n="lb"/>saw the dead infant. Uttarā wept bitterly and every-
<div n="lb"/>body asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa to give life to the infant somehow.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa did so and the child was named Parīkṣit
<div n="lb"/>remembering the prophetic words of the brāhmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Marriage.%} Parīkṣit married a princess named Mādra-
<div n="lb"/>vatī and got of her four sons named Janamejaya, Śruta-
[Page573-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena. Chapters 3, 4, 5, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Curse of a sage.%} Parīkṣit was greatly interested in
<div n="lb"/>hunting. Once he went to a big forest with his large
<div n="lb"/>retinue to hunt. While hunting he followed a deer
<div n="lb"/>which the king had struck with his arrow and he sepa-
<div n="lb"/>rated from the rest and went a long way deep into the
<div n="lb"/>forest. It was midday and the king was tired. Then he
<div n="lb"/>saw a sage sitting there and the king went in and asked
<div n="lb"/>him about the deer. The sage engrossed in his medita-
<div n="lb"/>tion did not hear that. The king mistook his silence to
<div n="lb"/>be arrogance and taking the dead body of a cobra lying
<div n="lb"/>nearby with the tip of his bow threw it round the neck
<div n="lb"/>of the sage and went his way. The sage did not know
<div n="lb"/>even that. The king returned to the palace after the
<div n="lb"/>hunting.
<div n="NI"/>The sage had a son named Gavijāta (In many places
<div n="lb"/>the name Śṛṅgī is used for Gavijāta). He was playing
<div n="lb"/>with the sons of other sages. One munikumāra (son of
<div n="lb"/>a sage) said, “Oh Gavijāta, your father is equal to Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Both have a serpent round their necks. But there is only
<div n="lb"/>one difference. The serpent round your father's neck
<div n="lb"/>is a dead one.” Gavijāta was greatly disturbed by this
<div n="lb"/>jeer and he immediately went to the āśrama to make
<div n="lb"/>enquiries. When he knew that an unknown person had
<div n="lb"/>done that foul deed he took water in his hand and said
<div n="lb"/>“Whoever be the person who put this dead snake round
<div n="lb"/>the neck of my father will die being bitten by the fierce
<div n="lb"/>cobra Takṣaka within seven days.” Only after pronounc-
<div n="lb"/>ing this horrible curse did he find out that the perpet-
<div n="lb"/>rator of that crime was none other than the most noble
<div n="lb"/>and charitable king, Parīkṣit. Gavijāta repented greatly
<div n="lb"/>and immediately sent word to the king about his curse
<div n="lb"/>through Gauramukha, a munikumāra. The king was a
<div n="lb"/>bit frightened first but then he started thinking about
<div n="lb"/>the way to escape from the curse. (Chapter 40, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, and 2nd Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4.) {%Takṣaka gets ready.%} As soon as the messenger Gaura-
<div n="lb"/>mukha departed from the palace Parīkṣit called the
<div n="lb"/>ministers to his side and conferred with them to find a
<div n="lb"/>way to escape from the cobra Takṣaka. They built a
<div n="lb"/>building on a huge pillar and gave all protections to
<div n="lb"/>the building. Brahmins well-versed in all the mantras
<div n="lb"/>and Viṣavaidyas (physicians in the treatment of snake-
<div n="lb"/>poisoning) of fame were asked to sit around the pillar
<div n="lb"/>and the place was well-guarded. The King sat in a
<div n="lb"/>room tightly closed. Six days went by. On the seventh
<div n="lb"/>day the celebrated Viṣavaidya Ka yapamaharṣi was on
<div n="lb"/>his way to the palace at the summons of the king.
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka was also on his way to the palace in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of a brahmin. They met on the way and though
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa did not know him first Takṣaka introduced
<div n="lb"/>himself when he knew that Kaśyapa was going to the
<div n="lb"/>palace to treat the king if anything happened. He said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh Kaśyapa, I am Takṣaka and none of your wits
<div n="lb"/>would be able to fight against the effects of my poison.
<div n="lb"/>If you want to know it we shall make a trial.” Saying
<div n="lb"/>so Takṣaka went and bit a big banyan tree standing
<div n="lb"/>nearby, and lo! the whole tree was burnt to ashes by
<div n="lb"/>the strength of the poison. Kaśyapa smilingly recited
<div n="lb"/>the Viṣahāri mantra and sprinkled some water on the
<div n="lb"/>ashes and lo! the tree stood in its place again with not
<div n="lb"/>a single mutilation anywhere. Takṣaka was astounded.
<div n="lb"/>He then bribed Kaśyapa. He said he would give him
<div n="lb"/>more than what could be expected of the king and
[Page573-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>requested him to return home. Kaśyapa returned and
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka went to the palace.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death of Parīkṣit.%} Takṣaka went and inspected the
<div n="lb"/>palace of Parīkṣit. There was no way to step in and
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka was astonished at the perfect protection given
<div n="lb"/>to the king. Takṣaka called all his relatives to his side
<div n="lb"/>and asked them to go to the King in the guise of
<div n="lb"/>brahmins carrying several kinds of fruits as presents.
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka crept inside a beautiful fruit in the shape of a
<div n="lb"/>worm and was carried along with the fruits taken to
<div n="lb"/>the king. The servants of the king took the fruits
<div n="lb"/>brought by the brahmins to the king and the king struck
<div n="lb"/>by the size and beauty of a fruit among them took it and
<div n="lb"/>cut it open. He saw a worm inside red in colour with
<div n="lb"/>two black spots as eyes. The king took it in his hand and
<div n="lb"/>at that instant it changed into Takṣaka and bit the king.
<div n="lb"/>After that it rose up into the air and disappeared. (Cha-
<div n="lb"/>pters 42 to 49, Ādi Parva and 2nd Skandha, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Parīkṣit as a king.%} Many researches have been made
<div n="lb"/>to fix the period of the reign of Parīkṣit.
<div n="lb"/>“Saptarṣayo maghāyuktāḥ
<div n="lb"/>Kale Pārikṣite sbhavan //
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 271, Matsya Purāṇa),
<div n="lb"/>“Te tu Pārikṣite kāle
<div n="lb"/>Maghāsvāsan dvijottamāḥ”
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 24, Aṃśa 4, Viṣṇu Purāṇa)
<div n="lb"/>Following these statements in the Purāṇas, astrono-
<div n="lb"/>mers and astrologers searched for the year or years in
<div n="lb"/>which the Saptarṣi maṇḍala (the constellation of a
<div n="lb"/>group of seven stars) and the month of māgha came into
<div n="lb"/>the same zodiac. It came in B.C. 3077 and then in B.C. 477.
<div n="lb"/>This would again occur in 2223 A.D. Parīkṣit, according
<div n="lb"/>to other facts, also must have lived in B.C. 3077.
<div n="NI"/>Pāṇḍavas went for their mahāprasthāna after entrusting
<div n="lb"/>the administration to the care of Parīkṣit. The Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata battle was fought in the year 3138 B.C.
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra ruled for 36 years and so Parīkṣit must
<div n="lb"/>have taken charge of the administration in 3102 B.C.
<div n="lb"/>Parīkṣit ruled for 60 years and his son Janamejaya be-
<div n="lb"/>came king in 3042 B.C. It was this Janamejaya who
<div n="lb"/>conducted the famous Sarpasatra.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Parīkṣit attained Svarga.%} Parīkṣit did not enter heaven
<div n="lb"/>as soon as he died. So Janamejaya at the advice of Nārada
<div n="lb"/>conducted a yāga called Ambāyāga for the salvation of
<div n="lb"/>the spirit of his father. It was during the navarātri
<div n="lb"/>period that this was done. Many eminent sages took
<div n="lb"/>part in the ceremony. All were received well and given
<div n="lb"/>gifts in plenty. He made pure brahmins read the
<div n="lb"/>Devībhāgavata with devotion in the presence of the
<div n="lb"/>deity to please Jagadambikā (mother goddess), queen
<div n="lb"/>of all queens (Rājarāje varī). When it was over, a
<div n="lb"/>divine brilliance like burning fire was visible in the sky
<div n="lb"/>and Nārada appeared before Janamejaya and said “Oh
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya, King of Kings, your father was lying bound
<div n="lb"/>by the shackles of his life on earth. But today he
<div n="lb"/>acquired a divine form and wearing divine apparels and
<div n="lb"/>ornaments went to the divine seat of Devī in a sacred
<div n="lb"/>Vimāna from Indrapura while Indra, devas and the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maidens stood praising him (Skandha 12, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Parīkṣit ruled the country for sixty years, with all
<div n="lb"/>virtues and goodness. (Chapter 49, Ādi Parva).
[Page574-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) After the great battle, one day at the request of a
<div n="lb"/>few, Vyāsa by his yogic powers arrayed all the dead
<div n="lb"/>great ones of the Pāṇḍava-Kaurava company. Parīkṣit
<div n="lb"/>was also called then to the Gaṅgā where it was arranged
<div n="lb"/>and Janamejaya who was present to witness the show
<div n="lb"/>then gave an Avabhṛtasnāna (ablution after a sacrifice)
<div n="lb"/>to his father. Parīkṣit disappeared after that. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>35, Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The synonyms of Parīkṣit are (1) Abhimanyusuta
<div n="lb"/>(2) Bhārataśreṣṭha (3) Kirīṭitanayātmaja (4) Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>śreṣṭha (5) Kurunandana (6) Kururāja (7) Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>vardhana (8) Pāṇḍaveya.
