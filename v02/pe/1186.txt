BHŪ¦(Ḥ). In the creation of the world, the Lord broke
<div n="lb"/>the beginningless “Aṇḍa” (the primal egg or seed)
<div n="lb"/>and from it the sound “Oṃ” emerged. The first sound
<div n="lb"/>of it was “BHŪḤ”; the second was “BHUVAḤ”;
<div n="lb"/>and the third was “SVAḤ”. So the combination “Bhūr
<div n="lb"/>Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ” was formed. Then came the most
<div n="lb"/>adorable and superlative effulgence of the creator
<div n="lb"/>(Savitā). That radiance dried up all water. A little of
<div n="lb"/>the water became a highly viscous substance. This
<div n="lb"/>viscous matter gradually solidified and became the earth.
<div n="lb"/>Where the aṇḍa originally was became the source of
<div n="lb"/>that supreme effulgence. As it was the first radiant
<div n="lb"/>light, it came to be called Āditya (ādi=first). The
<div n="lb"/>great procreator Brahmā seemed to emerge from the
<div n="lb"/>centre of the aṇḍa. The garbhajala (the water contai-
<div n="lb"/>ned in the aṇḍa) became the oceans and rivers of the
<div n="lb"/>world. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 43).
