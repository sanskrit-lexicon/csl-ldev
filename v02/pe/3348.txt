KARṆA I¦. The eldest son of Kuntī. Though he was the
brother of the Pāṇḍavas he joined sides with the Kaura-
vas and became the King of Aṅga. So the name of
Karṇa comes in the genealogy of the Aṅga royal family.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Karṇa.%} Pāṇḍu, a King of Candravaṃśa,
married Kuntī, daughter of King Śūrasena. This girl
was brought up even from childhood by a King called
Kuntibhoja. She grew up in the palace of the King. She
was once put in charge of attending to the welfare of
those engaged in religious duties. The sage Durvāsas
came there then and stayed for four months as the king's
guest. Kuntī served the sage during his stay there with
so much care, patience and devotion that the sage was
immensely pleased and gave her at the time of his de-
parture a divine mantra. If she called upon any god
repeating that mantra once, that god would manifest
himself to her and bless her with a son equal to him
[Page391-b+ 63]
in glory. The mantra was to be used only five times.
Kuntī was young and wanted to test the power of the
mantra. So she recited the mantra meditating on the
Sun. Instantly she felt she saw a divine person coming
to her from the sun. She was perplexed. But the
divine form embraced her and consoled her saying that
she would never lose her virginity even if she bore a
son from him. None excepting her step-mother knew
about this. In due course Kuntī delivered a male child
and with the help of her step-mother she put that child
in a box and floated it on the river Aśvā.
<div n="NI"/>That box leaving the river Aśvā entered the Yamunā
river and leaving Yamunā it entered the river Gaṅgā.
Drifting slowly the box reached Campāpurī, a country
of Sūtas. Adhiratha born of the Sūtavaṃśa and an ally
of the Kauravas, saw a box floating on the river while
he went for his bath and took it home. Rādhā, wife of
Adhiratha, who was childless was greatly pleased to see
a babe inside the box and they adopted it and brought
it up. The boy was named Vasuṣeṇa. It was this babe
that became the celebrated Karṇa afterwards. (Four
chapters from 305, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Education of Karṇa.%} Karṇa grew up in the house of
Adhiratha in the country of Aṅga bearing the names
Vasuṣeṇa and Vṛṣa. Kuntī knew this through spies.
When the time came for imparting education to Karṇa
Adhiratha sent him to Hastināpura to the presence of
Droṇa for teaching him archery. Karṇa studied under
Kṛpa and Paraśurāma also. After his education he
entered into a treaty with Duryodhana. (Chapter 309,
Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Karṇa is cursed.%} Karṇa was cursed by a brahmin and
Paraśurāma. The story is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Even while they were studying archery Arjuna and
Karṇa vied with each other. Karṇa once requested
Droṇa to teach him in private the secret of the Brahmā
missile to fight against Arjuna. But Droṇa did not
accede to his request.
<div n="NI"/>Karṇa then went to Mahendragiri and bowed before
Paraśurāma and represented himself as a member of the
Bhṛgu family. He said he had come to him to be his
disciple and learn the secret of the Brahmā missile from
him. Paraśurāma believed him and accepting him as
his disciple taught him many new techniques in archery.
Once Karṇa was wandering in the vicinity of the
āśrama when he saw a lonely cow grazing there and
Karṇa without knowing that it belonged to a brahmin
sent an arrow and killed it. The brahmin got furious
and cursed Karṇa thus “Oh, sinner, the wheel of your
chariot would go down in the mud when you face the
enemy to fight against whom you are now taking training.
Then, when you stand perplexed, your opponent would
cut off your head.” Karṇa requested for a removal of
the curse but the brahmin refused to show any mercy.
<div n="NI"/>Paraśurāma taught Karṇa the secret of the Brahmā
missile. One day tired after a day's fast and a walk
around the āśrama with his disciples Paraśurāma slept
resting his head on the lap of Karṇa. Then a
beetle named Alarka attacked Karṇa and started sucking
blood from his thigh. Blood was oozing from his thigh
and still Karṇa did not stir from his position lest it
should disturb his guru in his nap. Suddenly Paraśu-
rāma awoke and stared at the beetle and the beetle fell
[Page392-a+ 64]
dead. It then took the form of a demon and rising up
in the air said “Svāmin! I was once a demon called
Daṃśa. Once I carried away by force the wife of the
sage Bhṛgu and the angered sage cursed me and made
me a beetle. When I craved for pardon he said
that I would be given my original form by Paraśu-
rāma.”
<div n="NI"/>When the demon disappeared saying so much Paraśu-
rāma turned to Karṇa who stood with respect, his dress
all covered with blood. Paraśurāma said: “No brah-
min can bear so much pain with such patience. Surely,
you are not a brahmin. Let me know the truth.” Trem-
bling with fear Karṇa revealed his identity and then
Paraśurāma cursed him saying “You will forget the
secret of the Brahmā missile at the time when you want
to use it against your enemy.” (Chapters 2 and 3, Śānti
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%How Karṇa became the King of Aṅga.%} The Pāṇḍavas
and Kauravas were studying archery under Droṇācārya
together and Karṇa also was among them. When their
education was complete a day was fixed to exhibit the
skill of the students. The public also was invited to see
the skill of the princes. Everybody showed his best and
Arjuna displayed super-human skill so that the vast
assemblage was lost in wonder and admiration. Then
strode Karṇa to the scene and not only did he duplicate
with ease Arjuna's feats but he did show something
more. The assemblage was dumbfounded. Arjuna turnn-
ed pale. At this moment Kṛpa stood up and questioned
the right of Karṇa to compete with those with royal
blood in them. Then rose Duryodhana and said: “If
the combat is not in order simply because Karṇa is not
a prince it is easily remedied. I crown Karṇa as the
King of Aṅga”. Then there came to the scene the aged
Adhiratha, the foster-father of Karṇa, and as Karṇa
saw him coming he went and bowed before him and
Adhiratha embraced him with tears in his eyes. (Chap-
ters 134 to 136, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Karṇa's armour and ear-rings.%} Karṇa was born with an
armour on his body and rings in his ears. Chapter 99
of Adi Parva says thus: “To Kuntī was born of Sūrya
the mighty Karṇa. Even at his birth he was adorned
with an armour over his body and rings in his ears.”
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya had ordained that as long as Karṇa wore the
armour and ear-rings he would be unconquerable.
Indra knew this and wanted to get Karṇa rid of these
so that Arjuna, his son, might gain a victory over Karṇa.
Karṇa was reputed for his charity and Indra under the
garb of a brahmin went to Karṇa and begged of him
his ear-rings and armour. The Sun god had already
warned him in a dream that Indra would thus try to
deceive him. Still Karṇa could not bring himself to refuse
any gift that was asked of him and so he cut off the
ear-rings and armour with which he was born and gave
them to the Brāhmaṇa. The only request that the noble
Karṇa did make was that in separating the ornaments
from his body no wound should be made. Indra did it
with great skill neither hurting him nor making even a
scratch on this body. Indra bade Karṇa ask for any
boon he wanted. The Sun god had also advised him to
ask for a good weapon in return in case he gave away
his assets and so he requested Indra the best of the
weapons he possessed. Indra gave him his weapon, the
Śakti, called Vaijayantī also. Karṇa had to use that
[Page392-b+ 65]
weapon to kill the great Ghaṭotkaca in the Mahābhā-
rata battle.

the Pāṇḍavas and the Sun god approved of it. But
Karṇa refused to do so. He said he would never forsake
Duryodhana who had brought him up from his child-
