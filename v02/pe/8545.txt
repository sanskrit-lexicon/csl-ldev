VIŚVĀNARA¦. A King. For a time this King was
miserable as he was childless. But by the blessing of
Śiva, Viśvānara got a son named Gṛhapati by his wife
Śucismitā. Gṛhapati was destined to have life only up
to three years. But it is mentioned in Skanda Purāṇa that

Sāṅgaveda and obtained long life from Śiva.
