JĀTARŪPAŚILA¦. A mountain. This mountain stands
in a place having an area of thirteen yojanas, on the
opposite shore of the sea where the water-creatures fall
with tremendous cry at the mouth of the submarine fire
(Baḍavāgni). The monkeys sent by Sugrīva to search
for Sītā, made a search in this mountain also. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 40, Stanza 50).
