CŪṬU¦. (Dice). It is an imaginative paurāṇic assump-
<div n="lb"/>tion that there is a satanic force latent in dice, hunting,
<div n="lb"/>wine and women. There is a story to support the pre-
<div n="lb"/>sence of this evil power within the above four. Indra
<div n="lb"/>once turned the Aśvinīdevas out of his court labelling
<div n="lb"/>them as outcastes and banned wine to them. Discon-
<div n="lb"/>tented at this the Aśvinīdevas approached Cyavana and
<div n="lb"/>the latter performing a yāga invited the Aśvinīdevas and
<div n="lb"/>gave them the yāga wine, ‘Soma’. Infuriated at this
<div n="lb"/>Indra raised his celebrated Vajrāyudha (Weapon of
<div n="lb"/>thunder) to kill Cyavana. But the sage by his yogic
<div n="lb"/>powers paralysed the hands of Indra and instantly from
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial fire there arose Mada a genie to kill Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Frightened by this sight Indra fell at the feet of Cyavana
<div n="lb"/>and craved for pardon. The sage then tore the genie into
<div n="lb"/>four pieces and threw one each into dice, hunting, wine
<div n="lb"/>and women. That is why all the four are as alluring as
<div n="lb"/>destructive. (Saptama Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
