NĀRADA I¦. A very famous sage of the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Nārada was the son of Brahmā, born from
his lap. Brahmā mentally created the famous saptarṣis,
Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha and
Kratu. From Brahmā's anger was born Rudra, from his
lap Nārada, from his right thumb Dakṣa, from his mind
Sanaka and others and from his left thumb a daughter
called Vīraṇī. Dakṣa wedded Vīraṇī. (Devī Bhāgavata,
5th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Various births of Nārada.%} The Purāṇas refer to more
than seven prominent births of Nārada. He was first
born as the son of Brahmā, and after that, on account
of Brahmā's curse he was born as the Gandharva called
Upabarhaṇa. Following that he was born as the son of
emperor Drumila and was named Nārada. Again born as
the son of Brahmā under the name Nārada, he married
Mālatī and ended his life as a monkey. He was again
born as the son of Brahmā and was cursed by Dakṣa.
Afterwards he was born as the son of Dakṣa and also
as a worm. All these births did not occur in one and
[Page526-b+ 64]
the same Manvantara. Nārada may be noticed doing
something or other in connection with the various
characters in the Purāṇas. There is no other character
in the Purāṇas occupying so popular a place in them as
Nārada. The important five births of Nārada are des-
cribed below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%The Gandharva called Upabarhaṇa.%} Nārada born
from the lap of Brahmā desired to remain a celibate.
But, Brahmā suggested that he should assume responsi-
bility for procreation as his (Brahmā's) other sons like
Marīci and Sanaka had already become celibates.
Nārada did not accept this suggestion of Brahmā at
which the latter got angry and cursed Nārada to lose
his knowledge and to marry fifty beautiful women.
Brahmā continued:—“You will be born as a Gandharva
known as Upabarhaṇa and will become a great music-
ian. You will be unrivalled in the handling of the
Vīṇā. After your death as the Gandharva you will be
born as the son of a servant woman, and as such you
will be a great devotee of Viṣṇu. Afterwards you will
be born as my son when I will impart knowledge to
you.”
<div n="NI"/>There was a Gandharva called Citraketu, who performed
penance on the banks of the Puṣkara lake to propitiate
Śiva for a child. Śiva appeared and blessed Citraketu
to the effect that Nārada, the son of Brahmā, would be
born as his son. Accordingly the wife of Citraketu
delivered a son whom the family priest named Upa-
barhaṇa. The boy grew up as a devotee of Viṣṇu. Bṛhas-
pati taught him the worship of Hari (Viṣṇu). Upabar-
haṇa lived on the slopes of the Himālayas performing
penance. While Upabarhaṇa was one day engaged in Sa-
mādhi fifty daughters of the Gandharva called Citraratha
passed that way, and they fell in love with Upabarhaṇa,
who was in Samādhi. He awoke from Samādhi on hearing
the melodious songs of the fifty damsels who stood there
with palms joined in reverence. Upabarhaṇa too fell in
love with them, and he married all the fifty girls. He
returned with them to the palace and lived there for
thousands of years. Once the Gandharvas and the
Apsaras were invited to sing the story of Viṣṇu in
Brahmaloka. Upabarhaṇa accompanied them. He be-
came lustful towards Rambhā. The Prajāpatis, who
noticed it got angry, and Upabarhaṇa well-nigh dead
due to their curse returned home. He told his wives all
that had happened to him. He spread a darbha grass
on the ground and lay on it and died. Mālatī, the eldest
of his wives, got ready to curse Brahmā, Yama and
Mṛtyu. In great consternation they sought refuge under
Viṣṇu, who comforted and sent them back to Mālatī.
They saluted her. Then a brahmin, who went there
questioned Brahmā about the death of Upabarhaṇa.
The brahmin told him that, according to previous deci-
sion, life for another thousand years remained for Upa-
barhaṇa, but he died in the meantime on account of
the curse of Prajāpati. Immediately the brahmin assumed
the form of Viṣṇu. The brahmin blessed Upabarhaṇa
who woke up from death rubbing his eyes. He lived
happily at home with his wives. He was blessed with
children and grandchildren. Knowing that his end was
near Upabarhaṇa and Mālatī spent their time in
austerities on the banks of the Gaṅgā. At last Upabar-
haṇa expired, and Mālatī ended her life in his funeral
pyre. (Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
[Page527-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Son of Kalāvatī.%} There lived in Kānyakubja the
emperor called Drumila. He, along with his wife
Kalāvatī, performed penance on the banks of the Gaṅgā
for an offspring. Kalāvatī pleased Kaśyapa, by her
worship and with his blessing she became pregnant.
Drumila, who in the meantime had renounced every-
thing in life, decided to spend the rest of his life in the
forest itself. He gifted away all his wealth to brahmins
and died in the forest. Though Kalāvatī got ready to
follow him in the funeral pyre, a celestial voice stopped
her and she refrained from committing self-immolation.
She returned to the village and lived as a slave in a
brahmin's house. In due course of time she delivered a
son. On the birth of the child it rained in the land
which was suffering from failure of rains, and because
of that the brahmin master of Kalāvatī named the child
Nārada, meaning he who gives water. When the child
Nārada grew up he told his mother the story about his
former birth. He turned out to be a great devotee of
Viṣṇu. Meanwhile, Kalāvatī, who went to milk the
cow one night, was bitten to death by a snake, and
Nārada was orphaned. Śiva and three attendants of his
who went there in disguise were pleased at Nārada's
great devotion for Viṣṇu and his service-mentality. He
lived on the left-overs given by them. He repeated songs
sung by them about Viṣṇu. Gradually Nārada became
perfect devotee of Viṣṇu and a unique master of music.
Śiva and others imparted Bhāgavata to Nārada before
they left him. Nārada who thus attained divine know-
ledge performed penance for many years on the banks of
the Gaṅgā and died there. (Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Birth as Kapi (Monkey).%} Nārada, who expired on
the banks of the Gaṅgā was again born as the son of
Brahmā. Though the father wanted the son to get
married the latter preferred to spend his days in the medi-
tation on God. Brahmā then told his son as follows:—
“Why are you so much afraid of the house-holder's life?
Many people have attained salvation by following the
four āśramas (stages in life) like that of the celibate,
the house-holder, the anchorite and the sannyāsin. In
fact, only such people will be able to serve man and
God. A girl named Mālatī alias Damayantī is born to
maharṣi Sañjaya, and Śiva has granted her the
boon that in this birth you will become her husband.
You, therefore, go to Naranārāyaṇas engaged in penance
on the Himālayas. They will give Mālatī in marriage
to you.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Nārada went to Badarikāśrama where in the
presence of Naranārāyaṇas he married Mālatī.
<div n="NI"/>During those days Nārada and sage Parvata started on
a pilgrimage in the course of which they went to the
palace of emperor Sañjaya to observe Cāturmāsya. The
emperor left a well-furnished house at the disposal of the
pilgrims. He also deputed his daughter Damayantī to
serve them. The humble service of Damayantī pleased
them both. But, Damayantī's devotion towards Nārada
was more ardent and both of them noticed this fact.
One day Parvata asked Nārada whether Damayantī
did not take a special interest in him (Nārada) and to
this Nārada answered ‘Yes, I too think so’. Parvata
got angry at this answer of Nārada and told him thus:
“We had agreed at the time when we started on this
tour to divulge all secrets to each other Now you have
broken that contract. Why did you not tell me about
Damayantī's partiality for you? You become, therefore,
[Page527-b+ 65]
a monkey”. Nārada, in turn, cursed Parvata as follows:
“You will live in hell in Yamaloka for a hundred
years.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Nārada became a monkey and Parvata
lived in hell. At this juncture Sañjaya's ministers
advised him to marry his daughter to a prince, and the
news made her very sad. Sañjaya understood the reason
for his daughter's sadness from her nurse. The father
had ultimately to yield to her wishes and Damayantī
married Nārada, who had been turned into a monkey.
Hundred years rolled by, and Parvata, the period of
his curse being over, returned to the palace of Sañjaya.
Nārada treated Parvata duly well, and pleased at the
treatment, he gave redemption to Nārada from the
curse. Nārada lived very happily with Damayantī for a
long time at the palace, and after the demise of
Damayantī he attained Brahmaloka. (Bhāgavata, 7th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Born as Dakṣa's son.%} After the creation of the
Devas was over, Brahmā called Dakṣa to him and asked
him to marry Vīraṇī and procreate, and Dakṣa
accordingly begot five thousand sons of Vīraṇī. They
were called Haryaśvas Finding that the Haryaśvas also
were interested in the procreation of children Nārada,
the Devarṣi, approached and told them as follows:—
“Oh! Haryaśvas! You who are exceptionally vital
people seem to be trying to procreate children. But, you
have not enquired as to whether there is enough space
on earth for such large numbers of people. You are just
like children who know nothing about the world. How
will you procreate people? Since you could live absolute-
ly free in the sky, why do you not find out the limit of
the earth?”
<div n="NI"/>The Haryaśvas thereupon ran away in different places
to find out the limit of the earth, and they have not,
like the rivers which entered the ocean, returned yet.
<div n="NI"/>At the loss of the Haryaśvas in the above manner,
Dakṣa created the Śabalāśvas, whom also Nārada sent
away to various parts of the earth. Dakṣa again created
five thousand people whom also Nārada drove away in
the above manner. Angry and sad at this, Dakṣa cursed
Nārada thus:—“Well, Nārada! my children roam
about like this because of you. Therefore, you too in
future will be roaming about without a permanent
abode. Moreover, you will have rebirth as my son.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada became a world-trotter on account of the above
curse of Dakṣa. He was also reborn as the son of Dakṣa.
(Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha and Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part
1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Born as a worm.%} There is a story about Nārada
being born as a worm. On the approach of a chariot
the worm moved quickly away from its route lest its
wheel should crush it to death. The King seated in
the chariot burst out into laughter at the above sight
when the worm told him as follows:—“There is nothing
to be laughed at in my action. In every birth the body
is much dear to the ātman (soul). Just as you love
your body I also love and protect my body. (Mahā-
bhārata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Viṣṇu showed Nārada the function of Māyā.%} See under
Tāladhvaja I
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Nārada became a woman.%} While staying once with
Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā, Nārada and the former went out on
a tour in an aerial chariot. On the way they saw a
stream and Kṛṣṇa stopped the chariot there as Nārada
[Page528-a+ 65]
wanted to quench his thirst at the stream. Nārada drank
water from the stream disobeying Kṛṣṇa's injunction that
he should bathe before drinking water, and lo! the next
moment Nārada was turned into a woman and when ‘she’
looked around neither Kṛṣṇa nor the chariot was to be
seen. She wandered about in the forest and at last reached
an āśrama. When the Ṛṣi of the āśrama awoke from his
samādhi he saw standing before him a beautiful woman
who requested him to accept her as his disciple. He readi-
ly granted her request. The preceptor married the disci-
ple and in due course of time she became the mother of
sixty children. One day all the sixty children and their
father expired together. The grief-stricken widow felt too
weak to perform the obsequies of the dead. An extraordi-
nary hunger also held her in its grips. She raised her hand
to pluck a fruit from the mango tree that stood nearby
but could not reach the mango above. She placed
together the corpses one on the other, mounted upon
the heap of dead bodies and plucked the mango-fruit
Immediately a brahmin arrived on the spot and exhorted
the widow on the impropriety of taking food without
bathing after the death of husband and children. Then
the widow entered the stream and dived in its waters
holding above water the hand in which was held the
mango, and lo! it was Nārada who came out from the
water. Only the hand, which had been held above
water and did not therefore get wet, remained like that
of a woman with bangles thereon. The brahmin, who stood
there on the banks of the stream transformed himself into
Kṛṣṇa. As ordered by Kṛṣṇa Nārada again dived with the
whole of his body in the water when the hand also
turned into that of a man. The mango held in the hand
turned into an excellent Vīṇā. And Kṛṣṇa told Nārada:
“The Ṛṣi who lived with you as your husband and
who is no more is Kālapuruṣa, and the sixty children
are years Prabhava, Vibhava etc.
<div n="NI"/>Kṛṣṇa and Nārada then returned to Dvārakā. (Bhāga-
vata. 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Nārada met the woman called Bhakti.%} When Kalikāla
held the earth in its grips Nārada, on a particular
occasion, went round the world viewing the evils
of Kali, and he saw a young woman immersed in grief
sitting on the banks of the Yamunā, the sports field of
Kṛṣṇa. On both sides of her two old men were breath-
ing in an unconscious state, and the woman, weeping
was trying to restore them to consciousness. Many
other women were fanning the unconscious men and
trying to comfort the woman. Nārada approached the
young woman when she spoke to him as follows: ‘Oh!
great sage, please put an end to my grief, because your
words will remove all grief. I am called Bhakti and
these two old men are my sons, one of whom is known
as Jñāna (knowledge) and the other Vairāgya (renun-
ciation), and they have become old due to the impact
of time. The others found here are sacred rivers, who
have come to serve me. But, the service of nobody will
do me good.
<div n="NI"/>I was born in the Drāviḍa region, grew up in Karṇāṭaka,
lived here and there in Mahārāṣṭra and became old at
Gujarat whereat, atheists due to the evil of Kali inflict-
ed wounds on me for a long time so that I became
very weak. I did then go with my sons to the worship-
ful Vṛndāvana where I regained my old form and
became a young woman in the shape of a ghost. My
children suffer here in an unconscious state and I have
[Page528-b+ 65]
to leave this for another place. I am so very sad that
my sons have become old. Why did I become a young
woman when my sons were old people? We three were
touring together, and how then did this difference arise
with regard to us? Is it not the proper thing for the
mother to be older, and her children younger? You
will please explain the reason for all these.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada read out the Vedas and the Vedāṅgas to her,
to no purpose. Then Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumāra,
Sanatsujāta and others (all of them the mental off-
springs of Brahmā and gifted with eternal youth) asked
Nārada to read out Bhāgavata to the sons of Bhakti.
Nārada did so, and they became immediately young.
(Padma Purāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Tested Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Kṛṣṇa was living in Dvārakā with
his 16008 wives. Nārada once wanted to know how
Kṛṣṇa managed to maintain so many wives without
any difficulty or quarrels among them. To test it he
first went to the palace of Rukmiṇī where both Kṛṣṇa
and herself welcomed and treated him duly. Nārada
next visited Satyabhāmā's house where also Kṛṣṇa and
herself welcomed and treated him well. In the houses
of all the 16008 wives of Kṛṣṇa, Nārada had the same
experience as above. He was wonder-struck at the
divine powers of Kṛṣṇa and returned home praising
Kṛṣṇa (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Mahāviṣṇu put down Nārada's haughtiness.%} Nārada
had been very proud about his greatness as a musician.
Viṣṇu decided to put an end to this conceit of Nārada
for which purpose he took Nārada to a forest. There
they saw many women, whose limbs had been cut, crying
on account of insufferable pain. Mahāviṣṇu asked the
women who they were and why their limbs were cut.
They answered Viṣṇu that they were Rāgiṇīs, the
presiding deities over the various tunes and that they
were reduced to their present plight by the totally
erroneous singing of the tunes by Nārada.
<div n="NI"/>Nārada hung his head down in shame at the above
answer of the women and he was cured of his conceit.
(Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Hanūmān shamed Nārada.%} Nārada once met Hanū-
mān, who sang a song for him. Enjoying the music
Nārada placed his Vīṇā on a rock which had been
melted by the song of Hanūmān, and Nārada's
Vīṇā sank into the melted rock. When the singing by
Hanūmān was over, the rock, as of old, became hard
again and the Vīṇā got stuck up with it. Hanūmān
asked Nārada to melt the rock again with a song of his
and take away his Vīṇā. Nārada sang and sang, all to
no purpose. The rock did not melt again. Then Hanū-
mān sang a song and the rock melted. After praising
Hanūmān Nārada left the place ashamed. (Adbhuta
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa instructed Nārada about Māyā.%} Nārada once
requested Kṛṣṇa to teach him about Māyā (illusion)
and Kṛṣṇa told him that he would be taught sometime
later. Afterwards, one day while Nārada was walking
about, it began to rain and he took shelter from the rain
in a hut near at hand. There was a beautiful young woman
in the hut and Nārada fell in love with her. Nārada
lived with her for many years and a number of children
were born to them. But, a flood washed the mother and
children off into the sea, and Nārada was grief-stricken.
Then Kṛṣṇa appeared there and asked Nārada whether
he loved Māyā. Nārada confessed that he understood
[Page529-a+ 63]
Māyā very well and requested Kṛṣṇa to save him from
attachments on account of Māyā.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Nārada and Sanatkumāra.%} Once Nārada went to
Sanatkumāra and requested him to instruct him in spirit-
ual wisdom telling the latter that he had already learnt
the Vedas and all other scriptures and arts. Sanat-
kumāra accordingly taught him about the perfect
nature, without either beginning or end, of supreme
bliss. He taught Nārada thus: “Everything is God.
God exists in all animate and inanimate objects, and
God is superior to everything.” (Chāndogyopa-
niṣad).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Other information about Nārada.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once Brahmā advised him sixteen names which
would wash off all the evils of Kali, i.e. Hare Rāma
Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare
Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare. (Kalisantaraṇo-
paniṣad).
<div n="NI"/>(2) It was Nārada who gave the impetus to Vālmīki
for the composition of Rāmāyaṇa. Once Vālmīki asked
Nārada, who had returned after a tour of the three
worlds, who the greatest of men was. Nārada replied
‘Śrī Rāma’ and related to Vālmīki a brief history of
Rāma. Nārada departed from there and Vālmīki went
to the banks of the river Tamasā. It was there that
Vālmīki, at the sight of a hunter shooting down one
of the Krauñca birds, sang the famous verse ‘Māniṣāda’
etc. (See under Vālmīki).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Nārada once went to Veda Vyāsa, who was very un-
happy because he had no children. Questioned by Vyāsa
as to the means to have a son Nārada advised him to
worship Parāśakti (the supreme power). Accordingly
Vyāsa worshipped Parāśakti at Kailāsa and was gifted
with the son Śuka. (Devī Bhāgavata, 1st Skandha),
<div n="NI"/>(4) When once Nārada came to Vaikuṇṭha playing on
his Vīṇā Lakṣmīdevī went bashfully into the inner
apartment. In fact, she felt some love towards Nārada
who asked Viṣṇu for the reason thereof. Viṣṇu replied
that none existed who had absolutely conquered Māyā
(illusion) and that Lakṣmīdevī felt love towards Nārada
for a few moments because of the influence of Māyā.
(Devī Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Once Agastya kicked down mount Vindhya and
Nārada had also a small share in it. Vindhya had risen
above the path of the sun as Nārada told him queru-
lously that the Sun was circling Mahāmeru and was
ignoring Vindhya. (Devī Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Nārada once went to Pātālaloka and returned after
having been duly treated as guest by Prahlāda. (Brahma
Purāṇa, Chapter 23).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Nārada once cursed Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva
(sons of Kubera) and turned them into two trees. They
regained their former form on being touched by the
mortar drawn by Kṛṣṇa as a boy. (See under Nala-
kūbara).
<div n="NI"/>(8) It was Nārada who told Kaṃsa that Śrī Kṛṣṇa was
in Ambāḍi. He also told Kaṃsa about his previous his-
tory. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Vṛkāsura once asked Nārada who amongst the Tri-
mūrtis used to be pleased most easily and Nārada men-
tioned Śiva. It was therefore that the asura performed
penance to Śiva and pleased him. (Bhāgavata, 10th
Skandha).
[Page529-b+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>(10) The following story occurs in the Vāyu Purāṇa
as to how Nārada's Vīṇā became the musical instrument
of the world. Once Nārada was in Indra's court when
the latter asked Urvaśī to give a dance performance.
She did so and in the course of the dance saw Jayanta,
son of Indra seated before her. She was swept over by
a passion towards Jayanta as a result of which some
mistakes were made by her in dancing. Nārada, who
was playing his Vīṇā called Mahatī, also committed
some mistakes. Nārada did so to attract the attention
of the audience to Urvaśī's mistakes. Noticing the mis-
take Agastya, who too was present on the occasion,
cursed Urvaśī to become a bamboo. He cursed that
Nārada's Vīṇā should become the Vīṇā of the world
(Vāyu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Nārada's curse was also one of the causes for
Rāvaṇa's death. Rāvaṇa once requested Nārada to ex-
plain to him the meaning of ‘Om’, and when Nārada
refused to oblige him he threatened to cut Nārada's
tongue. Nārada in return cursed that the ten heads
of Rāvaṇa would be cut. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(12) During one Kalpa, Nārada was born as a Deva-
gandharva as the son of Kaśyapa by his wife Muni.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 1 and Svargārohaṇa Parva,
Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>(13) On one occasion Nārada recited Mahābhārata
which included three lakhs of ślokas. (Mahābhārata,
Ādi Parva, Chapter 1; Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Since he imparted Sāṅkhya wisdom to the sons
of Dakṣa they renounced the world and departed for
different places. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 75, Verse 7).
<div n="NI"/>(15) He was present at the birthday celebrations of
Arjuna. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 57).
<div n="NI"/>(16) He also was present in the company of Devas and
women, who attended Pāñcālī's Svayaṃvara. (Ādi
Parva, Chapter 186, Verse 7).
<div n="NI"/>(17) After Pāñcālī's Syayaṃvara he once went to the
Pāṇḍavas at Indraprastha and advised the five brothers
not to quarrel over Pāñcālī. It was he, who told them
the story of the Sundopasundas. He also arranged that
Pāñcālī should live by turns of one year each with each of
the five Pāṇḍava brothers. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 207,
Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(18) It was he who consoled and sent the apsaras called
Vargā, who was in the grip of a curse, to the south.
(See under Vargā).
<div n="NI"/>(19) In the form of a catechism he gave advice on
various topics to Dharmaputra. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
5).
<div n="NI"/>(20) When proposals for building a palace at Indra-
prastha for the Pāṇḍavas were under discussion Nārada
went there and gave descriptions of the courts of Indra,
Yama, Varuṇa, Kubera and Brahmā. (Sabhā Parva,
Chapters 5-11).
<div n="NI"/>(21) He related the story of Hariścandra to Dharma-
putra. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 23).
<div n="NI"/>(22) It was he who conveyed the information to
Dvārakā that Kṛṣṇa's grandson Aniruddha was imprison-
ed in the house of Bāṇa. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(23) He bathed Yudhiṣṭhira's head with holy waters at
the Rājasūya Yajña. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 55, Verse
10).
[Page530-a+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>(24) He prophesied that the Kauravas would get annihil-
ated. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 30, Verse 33).
<div n="NI"/>(25) When Pradyumna decided to kill Sālva it was
Nārada who saved him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 19,
Verse 22).
<div n="NI"/>(26) Nārada too was in the company of the Gandharvas
who had gone to receive Arjuna at Indraloka.) Vana
Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 14).
<div n="NI"/>(27) It was Nārada who informed Indra about the
Svayaṃvara of Damayantī. (Vana Parva, Chapter 54,
Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>(28) It was he who informed Sagara that his
60,000 children had been burnt to ashes in the fire
of Kapilamuni's anger. (Vana Parva, Chapter 107,
Verse 33).
<div n="NI"/>(29) On another occasion he prevented Arjuna from
using divine arrows. (Vana Parva, Chapter 183, Verse
18).
<div n="NI"/>(30) While the Pāṇḍavas were living in the Kāmyaka
forest Nārada went there and enjoyed hearing stories
related by Sage Mārkaṇḍeya. (Vana Parva, Chapter
183, Verse 47).
