NĀRADA I¦. A very famous sage of the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Nārada was the son of Brahmā, born from
<div n="lb"/>his lap. Brahmā mentally created the famous saptarṣis,
<div n="lb"/>Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha and
<div n="lb"/>Kratu. From Brahmā's anger was born Rudra, from his
<div n="lb"/>lap Nārada, from his right thumb Dakṣa, from his mind
<div n="lb"/>Sanaka and others and from his left thumb a daughter
<div n="lb"/>called Vīraṇī. Dakṣa wedded Vīraṇī. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>5th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Various births of Nārada.%} The Purāṇas refer to more
<div n="lb"/>than seven prominent births of Nārada. He was first
<div n="lb"/>born as the son of Brahmā, and after that, on account
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā's curse he was born as the Gandharva called
<div n="lb"/>Upabarhaṇa. Following that he was born as the son of
<div n="lb"/>emperor Drumila and was named Nārada. Again born as
<div n="lb"/>the son of Brahmā under the name Nārada, he married
<div n="lb"/>Mālatī and ended his life as a monkey. He was again
<div n="lb"/>born as the son of Brahmā and was cursed by Dakṣa.
<div n="lb"/>Afterwards he was born as the son of Dakṣa and also
<div n="lb"/>as a worm. All these births did not occur in one and
[Page526-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the same Manvantara. Nārada may be noticed doing
<div n="lb"/>something or other in connection with the various
<div n="lb"/>characters in the Purāṇas. There is no other character
<div n="lb"/>in the Purāṇas occupying so popular a place in them as
<div n="lb"/>Nārada. The important five births of Nārada are des-
<div n="lb"/>cribed below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%The Gandharva called Upabarhaṇa.%} Nārada born
<div n="lb"/>from the lap of Brahmā desired to remain a celibate.
<div n="lb"/>But, Brahmā suggested that he should assume responsi-
<div n="lb"/>bility for procreation as his (Brahmā's) other sons like
<div n="lb"/>Marīci and Sanaka had already become celibates.
<div n="lb"/>Nārada did not accept this suggestion of Brahmā at
<div n="lb"/>which the latter got angry and cursed Nārada to lose
<div n="lb"/>his knowledge and to marry fifty beautiful women.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā continued:—“You will be born as a Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>known as Upabarhaṇa and will become a great music-
<div n="lb"/>ian. You will be unrivalled in the handling of the
<div n="lb"/>Vīṇā. After your death as the Gandharva you will be
<div n="lb"/>born as the son of a servant woman, and as such you
<div n="lb"/>will be a great devotee of Viṣṇu. Afterwards you will
<div n="lb"/>be born as my son when I will impart knowledge to
<div n="lb"/>you.”
<div n="NI"/>There was a Gandharva called Citraketu, who performed
<div n="lb"/>penance on the banks of the Puṣkara lake to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Śiva for a child. Śiva appeared and blessed Citraketu
<div n="lb"/>to the effect that Nārada, the son of Brahmā, would be
<div n="lb"/>born as his son. Accordingly the wife of Citraketu
<div n="lb"/>delivered a son whom the family priest named Upa-
<div n="lb"/>barhaṇa. The boy grew up as a devotee of Viṣṇu. Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati taught him the worship of Hari (Viṣṇu). Upabar-
<div n="lb"/>haṇa lived on the slopes of the Himālayas performing
<div n="lb"/>penance. While Upabarhaṇa was one day engaged in Sa-
<div n="lb"/>mādhi fifty daughters of the Gandharva called Citraratha
<div n="lb"/>passed that way, and they fell in love with Upabarhaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>who was in Samādhi. He awoke from Samādhi on hearing
<div n="lb"/>the melodious songs of the fifty damsels who stood there
<div n="lb"/>with palms joined in reverence. Upabarhaṇa too fell in
<div n="lb"/>love with them, and he married all the fifty girls. He
<div n="lb"/>returned with them to the palace and lived there for
<div n="lb"/>thousands of years. Once the Gandharvas and the
<div n="lb"/>Apsaras were invited to sing the story of Viṣṇu in
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaloka. Upabarhaṇa accompanied them. He be-
<div n="lb"/>came lustful towards Rambhā. The Prajāpatis, who
<div n="lb"/>noticed it got angry, and Upabarhaṇa well-nigh dead
<div n="lb"/>due to their curse returned home. He told his wives all
<div n="lb"/>that had happened to him. He spread a darbha grass
<div n="lb"/>on the ground and lay on it and died. Mālatī, the eldest
<div n="lb"/>of his wives, got ready to curse Brahmā, Yama and
<div n="lb"/>Mṛtyu. In great consternation they sought refuge under
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, who comforted and sent them back to Mālatī.
<div n="lb"/>They saluted her. Then a brahmin, who went there
<div n="lb"/>questioned Brahmā about the death of Upabarhaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The brahmin told him that, according to previous deci-
<div n="lb"/>sion, life for another thousand years remained for Upa-
<div n="lb"/>barhaṇa, but he died in the meantime on account of
<div n="lb"/>the curse of Prajāpati. Immediately the brahmin assumed
<div n="lb"/>the form of Viṣṇu. The brahmin blessed Upabarhaṇa
<div n="lb"/>who woke up from death rubbing his eyes. He lived
<div n="lb"/>happily at home with his wives. He was blessed with
<div n="lb"/>children and grandchildren. Knowing that his end was
<div n="lb"/>near Upabarhaṇa and Mālatī spent their time in
<div n="lb"/>austerities on the banks of the Gaṅgā. At last Upabar-
<div n="lb"/>haṇa expired, and Mālatī ended her life in his funeral
<div n="lb"/>pyre. (Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
[Page527-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Son of Kalāvatī.%} There lived in Kānyakubja the
<div n="lb"/>emperor called Drumila. He, along with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Kalāvatī, performed penance on the banks of the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>for an offspring. Kalāvatī pleased Kaśyapa, by her
<div n="lb"/>worship and with his blessing she became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>Drumila, who in the meantime had renounced every-
<div n="lb"/>thing in life, decided to spend the rest of his life in the
<div n="lb"/>forest itself. He gifted away all his wealth to brahmins
<div n="lb"/>and died in the forest. Though Kalāvatī got ready to
<div n="lb"/>follow him in the funeral pyre, a celestial voice stopped
<div n="lb"/>her and she refrained from committing self-immolation.
<div n="lb"/>She returned to the village and lived as a slave in a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin's house. In due course of time she delivered a
<div n="lb"/>son. On the birth of the child it rained in the land
<div n="lb"/>which was suffering from failure of rains, and because
<div n="lb"/>of that the brahmin master of Kalāvatī named the child
<div n="lb"/>Nārada, meaning he who gives water. When the child
<div n="lb"/>Nārada grew up he told his mother the story about his
<div n="lb"/>former birth. He turned out to be a great devotee of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. Meanwhile, Kalāvatī, who went to milk the
<div n="lb"/>cow one night, was bitten to death by a snake, and
<div n="lb"/>Nārada was orphaned. Śiva and three attendants of his
<div n="lb"/>who went there in disguise were pleased at Nārada's
<div n="lb"/>great devotion for Viṣṇu and his service-mentality. He
<div n="lb"/>lived on the left-overs given by them. He repeated songs
<div n="lb"/>sung by them about Viṣṇu. Gradually Nārada became
<div n="lb"/>perfect devotee of Viṣṇu and a unique master of music.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and others imparted Bhāgavata to Nārada before
<div n="lb"/>they left him. Nārada who thus attained divine know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge performed penance for many years on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Gaṅgā and died there. (Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Birth as Kapi (Monkey).%} Nārada, who expired on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the Gaṅgā was again born as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Though the father wanted the son to get
<div n="lb"/>married the latter preferred to spend his days in the medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation on God. Brahmā then told his son as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>“Why are you so much afraid of the house-holder's life?
<div n="lb"/>Many people have attained salvation by following the
<div n="lb"/>four āśramas (stages in life) like that of the celibate,
<div n="lb"/>the house-holder, the anchorite and the sannyāsin. In
<div n="lb"/>fact, only such people will be able to serve man and
<div n="lb"/>God. A girl named Mālatī alias Damayantī is born to
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi Sañjaya, and Śiva has granted her the
<div n="lb"/>boon that in this birth you will become her husband.
<div n="lb"/>You, therefore, go to Naranārāyaṇas engaged in penance
<div n="lb"/>on the Himālayas. They will give Mālatī in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to you.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Nārada went to Badarikāśrama where in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Naranārāyaṇas he married Mālatī.
<div n="NI"/>During those days Nārada and sage Parvata started on
<div n="lb"/>a pilgrimage in the course of which they went to the
<div n="lb"/>palace of emperor Sañjaya to observe Cāturmāsya. The
<div n="lb"/>emperor left a well-furnished house at the disposal of the
<div n="lb"/>pilgrims. He also deputed his daughter Damayantī to
<div n="lb"/>serve them. The humble service of Damayantī pleased
<div n="lb"/>them both. But, Damayantī's devotion towards Nārada
<div n="lb"/>was more ardent and both of them noticed this fact.
<div n="lb"/>One day Parvata asked Nārada whether Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>did not take a special interest in him (Nārada) and to
<div n="lb"/>this Nārada answered ‘Yes, I too think so’. Parvata
<div n="lb"/>got angry at this answer of Nārada and told him thus:
<div n="lb"/>“We had agreed at the time when we started on this
<div n="lb"/>tour to divulge all secrets to each other Now you have
<div n="lb"/>broken that contract. Why did you not tell me about
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī's partiality for you? You become, therefore,
[Page527-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>a monkey”. Nārada, in turn, cursed Parvata as follows:
<div n="lb"/>“You will live in hell in Yamaloka for a hundred
<div n="lb"/>years.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Nārada became a monkey and Parvata
<div n="lb"/>lived in hell. At this juncture Sañjaya's ministers
<div n="lb"/>advised him to marry his daughter to a prince, and the
<div n="lb"/>news made her very sad. Sañjaya understood the reason
<div n="lb"/>for his daughter's sadness from her nurse. The father
<div n="lb"/>had ultimately to yield to her wishes and Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>married Nārada, who had been turned into a monkey.
<div n="lb"/>Hundred years rolled by, and Parvata, the period of
<div n="lb"/>his curse being over, returned to the palace of Sañjaya.
<div n="lb"/>Nārada treated Parvata duly well, and pleased at the
<div n="lb"/>treatment, he gave redemption to Nārada from the
<div n="lb"/>curse. Nārada lived very happily with Damayantī for a
<div n="lb"/>long time at the palace, and after the demise of
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī he attained Brahmaloka. (Bhāgavata, 7th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Born as Dakṣa's son.%} After the creation of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas was over, Brahmā called Dakṣa to him and asked
<div n="lb"/>him to marry Vīraṇī and procreate, and Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>accordingly begot five thousand sons of Vīraṇī. They
<div n="lb"/>were called Haryaśvas Finding that the Haryaśvas also
<div n="lb"/>were interested in the procreation of children Nārada,
<div n="lb"/>the Devarṣi, approached and told them as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>“Oh! Haryaśvas! You who are exceptionally vital
<div n="lb"/>people seem to be trying to procreate children. But, you
<div n="lb"/>have not enquired as to whether there is enough space
<div n="lb"/>on earth for such large numbers of people. You are just
<div n="lb"/>like children who know nothing about the world. How
<div n="lb"/>will you procreate people? Since you could live absolute-
<div n="lb"/>ly free in the sky, why do you not find out the limit of
<div n="lb"/>the earth?”
<div n="NI"/>The Haryaśvas thereupon ran away in different places
<div n="lb"/>to find out the limit of the earth, and they have not,
<div n="lb"/>like the rivers which entered the ocean, returned yet.
<div n="NI"/>At the loss of the Haryaśvas in the above manner,
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa created the Śabalāśvas, whom also Nārada sent
<div n="lb"/>away to various parts of the earth. Dakṣa again created
<div n="lb"/>five thousand people whom also Nārada drove away in
<div n="lb"/>the above manner. Angry and sad at this, Dakṣa cursed
<div n="lb"/>Nārada thus:—“Well, Nārada! my children roam
<div n="lb"/>about like this because of you. Therefore, you too in
<div n="lb"/>future will be roaming about without a permanent
<div n="lb"/>abode. Moreover, you will have rebirth as my son.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada became a world-trotter on account of the above
<div n="lb"/>curse of Dakṣa. He was also reborn as the son of Dakṣa.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha and Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part
<div n="lb"/>1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Born as a worm.%} There is a story about Nārada
<div n="lb"/>being born as a worm. On the approach of a chariot
<div n="lb"/>the worm moved quickly away from its route lest its
<div n="lb"/>wheel should crush it to death. The King seated in
<div n="lb"/>the chariot burst out into laughter at the above sight
<div n="lb"/>when the worm told him as follows:—“There is nothing
<div n="lb"/>to be laughed at in my action. In every birth the body
<div n="lb"/>is much dear to the ātman (soul). Just as you love
<div n="lb"/>your body I also love and protect my body. (Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Viṣṇu showed Nārada the function of Māyā.%} See under
<div n="lb"/>Tāladhvaja I
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Nārada became a woman.%} While staying once with
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā, Nārada and the former went out on
<div n="lb"/>a tour in an aerial chariot. On the way they saw a
<div n="lb"/>stream and Kṛṣṇa stopped the chariot there as Nārada
[Page528-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>wanted to quench his thirst at the stream. Nārada drank
<div n="lb"/>water from the stream disobeying Kṛṣṇa's injunction that
<div n="lb"/>he should bathe before drinking water, and lo! the next
<div n="lb"/>moment Nārada was turned into a woman and when ‘she’
<div n="lb"/>looked around neither Kṛṣṇa nor the chariot was to be
<div n="lb"/>seen. She wandered about in the forest and at last reached
<div n="lb"/>an āśrama. When the Ṛṣi of the āśrama awoke from his
<div n="lb"/>samādhi he saw standing before him a beautiful woman
<div n="lb"/>who requested him to accept her as his disciple. He readi-
<div n="lb"/>ly granted her request. The preceptor married the disci-
<div n="lb"/>ple and in due course of time she became the mother of
<div n="lb"/>sixty children. One day all the sixty children and their
<div n="lb"/>father expired together. The grief-stricken widow felt too
<div n="lb"/>weak to perform the obsequies of the dead. An extraordi-
<div n="lb"/>nary hunger also held her in its grips. She raised her hand
<div n="lb"/>to pluck a fruit from the mango tree that stood nearby
<div n="lb"/>but could not reach the mango above. She placed
<div n="lb"/>together the corpses one on the other, mounted upon
<div n="lb"/>the heap of dead bodies and plucked the mango-fruit
<div n="lb"/>Immediately a brahmin arrived on the spot and exhorted
<div n="lb"/>the widow on the impropriety of taking food without
<div n="lb"/>bathing after the death of husband and children. Then
<div n="lb"/>the widow entered the stream and dived in its waters
<div n="lb"/>holding above water the hand in which was held the
<div n="lb"/>mango, and lo! it was Nārada who came out from the
<div n="lb"/>water. Only the hand, which had been held above
<div n="lb"/>water and did not therefore get wet, remained like that
<div n="lb"/>of a woman with bangles thereon. The brahmin, who stood
<div n="lb"/>there on the banks of the stream transformed himself into
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. As ordered by Kṛṣṇa Nārada again dived with the
<div n="lb"/>whole of his body in the water when the hand also
<div n="lb"/>turned into that of a man. The mango held in the hand
<div n="lb"/>turned into an excellent Vīṇā. And Kṛṣṇa told Nārada:
<div n="lb"/>“The Ṛṣi who lived with you as your husband and
<div n="lb"/>who is no more is Kālapuruṣa, and the sixty children
<div n="lb"/>are years Prabhava, Vibhava etc.
<div n="NI"/>Kṛṣṇa and Nārada then returned to Dvārakā. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata. 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Nārada met the woman called Bhakti.%} When Kalikāla
<div n="lb"/>held the earth in its grips Nārada, on a particular
<div n="lb"/>occasion, went round the world viewing the evils
<div n="lb"/>of Kali, and he saw a young woman immersed in grief
<div n="lb"/>sitting on the banks of the Yamunā, the sports field of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. On both sides of her two old men were breath-
<div n="lb"/>ing in an unconscious state, and the woman, weeping
<div n="lb"/>was trying to restore them to consciousness. Many
<div n="lb"/>other women were fanning the unconscious men and
<div n="lb"/>trying to comfort the woman. Nārada approached the
<div n="lb"/>young woman when she spoke to him as follows: ‘Oh!
<div n="lb"/>great sage, please put an end to my grief, because your
<div n="lb"/>words will remove all grief. I am called Bhakti and
<div n="lb"/>these two old men are my sons, one of whom is known
<div n="lb"/>as Jñāna (knowledge) and the other Vairāgya (renun-
<div n="lb"/>ciation), and they have become old due to the impact
<div n="lb"/>of time. The others found here are sacred rivers, who
<div n="lb"/>have come to serve me. But, the service of nobody will
<div n="lb"/>do me good.
<div n="NI"/>I was born in the Drāviḍa region, grew up in Karṇāṭaka,
<div n="lb"/>lived here and there in Mahārāṣṭra and became old at
<div n="lb"/>Gujarat whereat, atheists due to the evil of Kali inflict-
<div n="lb"/>ed wounds on me for a long time so that I became
<div n="lb"/>very weak. I did then go with my sons to the worship-
<div n="lb"/>ful Vṛndāvana where I regained my old form and
<div n="lb"/>became a young woman in the shape of a ghost. My
<div n="lb"/>children suffer here in an unconscious state and I have
[Page528-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to leave this for another place. I am so very sad that
<div n="lb"/>my sons have become old. Why did I become a young
<div n="lb"/>woman when my sons were old people? We three were
<div n="lb"/>touring together, and how then did this difference arise
<div n="lb"/>with regard to us? Is it not the proper thing for the
<div n="lb"/>mother to be older, and her children younger? You
<div n="lb"/>will please explain the reason for all these.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada read out the Vedas and the Vedāṅgas to her,
<div n="lb"/>to no purpose. Then Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumāra,
<div n="lb"/>Sanatsujāta and others (all of them the mental off-
<div n="lb"/>springs of Brahmā and gifted with eternal youth) asked
<div n="lb"/>Nārada to read out Bhāgavata to the sons of Bhakti.
<div n="lb"/>Nārada did so, and they became immediately young.
<div n="lb"/>(Padma Purāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Tested Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Kṛṣṇa was living in Dvārakā with
<div n="lb"/>his 16008 wives. Nārada once wanted to know how
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa managed to maintain so many wives without
<div n="lb"/>any difficulty or quarrels among them. To test it he
<div n="lb"/>first went to the palace of Rukmiṇī where both Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and herself welcomed and treated him duly. Nārada
<div n="lb"/>next visited Satyabhāmā's house where also Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>herself welcomed and treated him well. In the houses
<div n="lb"/>of all the 16008 wives of Kṛṣṇa, Nārada had the same
<div n="lb"/>experience as above. He was wonder-struck at the
<div n="lb"/>divine powers of Kṛṣṇa and returned home praising
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Mahāviṣṇu put down Nārada's haughtiness.%} Nārada
<div n="lb"/>had been very proud about his greatness as a musician.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu decided to put an end to this conceit of Nārada
<div n="lb"/>for which purpose he took Nārada to a forest. There
<div n="lb"/>they saw many women, whose limbs had been cut, crying
<div n="lb"/>on account of insufferable pain. Mahāviṣṇu asked the
<div n="lb"/>women who they were and why their limbs were cut.
<div n="lb"/>They answered Viṣṇu that they were Rāgiṇīs, the
<div n="lb"/>presiding deities over the various tunes and that they
<div n="lb"/>were reduced to their present plight by the totally
<div n="lb"/>erroneous singing of the tunes by Nārada.
<div n="NI"/>Nārada hung his head down in shame at the above
<div n="lb"/>answer of the women and he was cured of his conceit.
<div n="lb"/>(Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Hanūmān shamed Nārada.%} Nārada once met Hanū-
<div n="lb"/>mān, who sang a song for him. Enjoying the music
<div n="lb"/>Nārada placed his Vīṇā on a rock which had been
<div n="lb"/>melted by the song of Hanūmān, and Nārada's
<div n="lb"/>Vīṇā sank into the melted rock. When the singing by
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān was over, the rock, as of old, became hard
<div n="lb"/>again and the Vīṇā got stuck up with it. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>asked Nārada to melt the rock again with a song of his
<div n="lb"/>and take away his Vīṇā. Nārada sang and sang, all to
<div n="lb"/>no purpose. The rock did not melt again. Then Hanū-
<div n="lb"/>mān sang a song and the rock melted. After praising
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān Nārada left the place ashamed. (Adbhuta
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa instructed Nārada about Māyā.%} Nārada once
<div n="lb"/>requested Kṛṣṇa to teach him about Māyā (illusion)
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa told him that he would be taught sometime
<div n="lb"/>later. Afterwards, one day while Nārada was walking
<div n="lb"/>about, it began to rain and he took shelter from the rain
<div n="lb"/>in a hut near at hand. There was a beautiful young woman
<div n="lb"/>in the hut and Nārada fell in love with her. Nārada
<div n="lb"/>lived with her for many years and a number of children
<div n="lb"/>were born to them. But, a flood washed the mother and
<div n="lb"/>children off into the sea, and Nārada was grief-stricken.
<div n="lb"/>Then Kṛṣṇa appeared there and asked Nārada whether
<div n="lb"/>he loved Māyā. Nārada confessed that he understood
[Page529-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Māyā very well and requested Kṛṣṇa to save him from
<div n="lb"/>attachments on account of Māyā.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Nārada and Sanatkumāra.%} Once Nārada went to
<div n="lb"/>Sanatkumāra and requested him to instruct him in spirit-
<div n="lb"/>ual wisdom telling the latter that he had already learnt
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and all other scriptures and arts. Sanat-
<div n="lb"/>kumāra accordingly taught him about the perfect
<div n="lb"/>nature, without either beginning or end, of supreme
<div n="lb"/>bliss. He taught Nārada thus: “Everything is God.
<div n="lb"/>God exists in all animate and inanimate objects, and
<div n="lb"/>God is superior to everything.” (Chāndogyopa-
<div n="lb"/>niṣad).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Other information about Nārada.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once Brahmā advised him sixteen names which
<div n="lb"/>would wash off all the evils of Kali, i.e. Hare Rāma
<div n="lb"/>Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare. (Kalisantaraṇo-
<div n="lb"/>paniṣad).
<div n="NI"/>(2) It was Nārada who gave the impetus to Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>for the composition of Rāmāyaṇa. Once Vālmīki asked
<div n="lb"/>Nārada, who had returned after a tour of the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds, who the greatest of men was. Nārada replied
<div n="lb"/>‘Śrī Rāma’ and related to Vālmīki a brief history of
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. Nārada departed from there and Vālmīki went
<div n="lb"/>to the banks of the river Tamasā. It was there that
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki, at the sight of a hunter shooting down one
<div n="lb"/>of the Krauñca birds, sang the famous verse ‘Māniṣāda’
<div n="lb"/>etc. (See under Vālmīki).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Nārada once went to Veda Vyāsa, who was very un-
<div n="lb"/>happy because he had no children. Questioned by Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>as to the means to have a son Nārada advised him to
<div n="lb"/>worship Parāśakti (the supreme power). Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa worshipped Parāśakti at Kailāsa and was gifted

<div n="NI"/>(4) When once Nārada came to Vaikuṇṭha playing on
<div n="lb"/>his Vīṇā Lakṣmīdevī went bashfully into the inner
<div n="lb"/>apartment. In fact, she felt some love towards Nārada
<div n="lb"/>who asked Viṣṇu for the reason thereof. Viṣṇu replied
<div n="lb"/>that none existed who had absolutely conquered Māyā
<div n="lb"/>(illusion) and that Lakṣmīdevī felt love towards Nārada
<div n="lb"/>for a few moments because of the influence of Māyā.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Once Agastya kicked down mount Vindhya and
<div n="lb"/>Nārada had also a small share in it. Vindhya had risen
<div n="lb"/>above the path of the sun as Nārada told him queru-
<div n="lb"/>lously that the Sun was circling Mahāmeru and was
<div n="lb"/>ignoring Vindhya. (Devī Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).

<div n="lb"/>regained their former form on being touched by the
<div n="lb"/>mortar drawn by Kṛṣṇa as a boy. (See under Nala-
<div n="lb"/>kūbara).
<div n="NI"/>(8) It was Nārada who told Kaṃsa that Śrī Kṛṣṇa was
<div n="lb"/>in Ambāḍi. He also told Kaṃsa about his previous his-
<div n="lb"/>tory. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Vṛkāsura once asked Nārada who amongst the Tri-
<div n="lb"/>mūrtis used to be pleased most easily and Nārada men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned Śiva. It was therefore that the asura performed
<div n="lb"/>penance to Śiva and pleased him. (Bhāgavata, 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
[Page529-b+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>(10) The following story occurs in the Vāyu Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>as to how Nārada's Vīṇā became the musical instrument
<div n="lb"/>of the world. Once Nārada was in Indra's court when
<div n="lb"/>the latter asked Urvaśī to give a dance performance.
<div n="lb"/>She did so and in the course of the dance saw Jayanta,
<div n="lb"/>son of Indra seated before her. She was swept over by
<div n="lb"/>a passion towards Jayanta as a result of which some
<div n="lb"/>mistakes were made by her in dancing. Nārada, who
<div n="lb"/>was playing his Vīṇā called Mahatī, also committed
<div n="lb"/>some mistakes. Nārada did so to attract the attention
<div n="lb"/>of the audience to Urvaśī's mistakes. Noticing the mis-
<div n="lb"/>take Agastya, who too was present on the occasion,
<div n="lb"/>cursed Urvaśī to become a bamboo. He cursed that
<div n="lb"/>Nārada's Vīṇā should become the Vīṇā of the world
<div n="lb"/>(Vāyu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Nārada's curse was also one of the causes for
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa's death. Rāvaṇa once requested Nārada to ex-
<div n="lb"/>plain to him the meaning of ‘Om’, and when Nārada
<div n="lb"/>refused to oblige him he threatened to cut Nārada's
<div n="lb"/>tongue. Nārada in return cursed that the ten heads
<div n="lb"/>of Rāvaṇa would be cut. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
