VIVASVĀN I¦. The Sun.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Sūrya (Sun) has a large number
<div n="lb"/>of synonyms. But prominence is given to two of them,
<div n="lb"/>Mārtaṇḍa and Vivasvān in the Purāṇas. Twelve devas
<div n="lb"/>were born to Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Aditi. As
<div n="lb"/>these twelve were the sons of Aditi they were called
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas. The Dvādaśādityas (the twelve Ādityas) are
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, Śakra, Aryaman, Dhātā, Tvaṣṭā, Pūṣā Vivasvān,
<div n="lb"/>Savitā, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aṃśu and Bhaga. These twelve
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas were, in the previous Manvantara (Age of
<div n="lb"/>Manu) of Manu Cākṣuṣa, twelve Devas called the
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣitas. When the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara came to an
<div n="lb"/>end and the Vaivasvata Manvantara was about to
<div n="lb"/>begin, the twelve Tuṣitas met together and after a con-
<div n="lb"/>sultation, they took birth as the sons of Aditi. In this
<div n="lb"/>birth they were known by the name Dvādaśādityas.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The name Mārtaṇḍa.%} As Aditi was pregnant, Candra
<div n="lb"/>went to the hermitage asking for alms. Due to her diffi-
<div n="lb"/>culties of pregnancy Aditi was not in a position to rise
<div n="lb"/>up instantly and greet the visitor. Candra thought that
<div n="lb"/>it was due to disrespect. So he cursed her. Let the
<div n="lb"/>child in your womb die.” At this Aditi became misera-
<div n="lb"/>ble. Kaśyapa saw her crying incessantly and asked for
<div n="lb"/>the cause. Aditi told him all that had happened.
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa blessed her and said that the infant would not
<div n="lb"/>die. Thus the child which was lying dead in the womb
<div n="lb"/>came to life again. As the ‘aṇḍa’ (egg-embryo) of
<div n="lb"/>Vivasvān went mṛta (died) by the curse of Candra, he
<div n="lb"/>came to be called Mārtaṇḍa (he who has aṇḍa which
<div n="lb"/>has become mṛta). When the child was born he was
<div n="lb"/>given the name Vivasvān.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Family life.%} Vivasvān married Saṃjñā, the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvakarmā. The first child born to Vivasvān by
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā was Vaivasvata Manu. The Sūrya (Solar)
<div n="lb"/>dynasty begins from this Vaivasvata Manu. Saṃjñā
<div n="lb"/>again gave birth to two children Yama and Yamī. Then
<div n="lb"/>finding it difficult to bear the fierce brightness of the
<div n="lb"/>sun Saṃjñā gave her place to her maid Chāyā otherwise
<div n="lb"/>called Savarṇā, and went to the house of her father.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā did not like this action on the part of his
<div n="lb"/>daughter. So Saṃjñā took the form of a mare and went
<div n="lb"/>to the pastures of North Kuru. Thinking Chāyā to be
<div n="lb"/>his wife Saṃjñā, Vivasvān went to bed with her. She
<div n="lb"/>conceived and gave birth to two sons and a daughter.
<div n="lb"/>The sons were named Sāvarṇi and Śani and the daughter
<div n="lb"/>was named Tapatī. Chāyā loved her own children more.
<div n="lb"/>The children of Saṃjñā were grieved at this. Yama once
<div n="lb"/>lifted his leg to kick her. “Let that leg be broken.”
<div n="lb"/>Chāyā cursed him. The miserable Yama ran to his
<div n="lb"/>father and said. “Father, this mother hates us and loves
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi and Śani more. It is true that I lifted up my
<div n="lb"/>leg. But my leg did not touch mother's head. Father, I
<div n="lb"/>request you to pardon the wrong I have done because of
<div n="lb"/>my ignorance. Have pity on me and tell me how to save
<div n="lb"/>my leg from breaking.” Vivasvān said to Yama that his
<div n="lb"/>leg would not be broken, but because of the curse worms
<div n="lb"/>would bite his leg. Vivasvān understood that Chāyā
<div n="lb"/>was not the real mother. He went to Viśvakarmā.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā put Vivasvān on his turning machine and
<div n="lb"/>by turning lessened his brightness. Vivasvān who was
<div n="lb"/>made more handsome by turning, found out his wife
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā, and approached her. But thinking him to be
<div n="lb"/>somebody else she moved away from him. In the mean-
<div n="lb"/>while two male persons were born from the nostrils of
[Page879-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Saṃjñā. There is another story that these two persons
<div n="lb"/>were the Aśvinidevas. Vivasvān and Saṃjñā came home.
<div n="lb"/>As a retribution for the wrong he had done, Yama
<div n="lb"/>ruled over his subjects justly and earned the name
<div n="lb"/>Dharmarāja. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 21; Bhaviṣya
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 47; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>171).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Some details about Vivasvān.%} (i) In Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 3, the 108 names of Vivasvān

<div n="NI"/>(iii) Vivasvān performed sacrifice in strict accordance
<div n="lb"/>with the instructions given in the Vedas and gave as

<div n="lb"/>southern quarter. From that day onwards the south
<div n="lb"/>got the name Dakṣiṇadiśā. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 109, Stanza 1).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) In days of yore Mahāviṣṇu advised Vivasvān
<div n="lb"/>“Anaśvaratākarma-yoga”. Vivasvān advised this art to
<div n="lb"/>his son Vaivasvata Manu. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>28, Stanza 1).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Vivasvān is included among the twentyeight Pra-

<div n="lb"/>taught his son Vaivasvata Manu the same in Tretāyuga.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 348, Stanza 50).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) The Aśvinikumāras, Nāsatya and Dasra, are the

<div n="lb"/>his wife Saṃjñā. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 150,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 17).
