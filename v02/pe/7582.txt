TRIJAṬĀ¦. A servant demoness of the palace of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Trijaṭā was one among the demonesses who were deput-
<div n="lb"/>ed to entice Sītā, sitting dejected under the Aśoka
<div n="lb"/>tree, to the side of Rāvaṇa. All the demonesses slept
<div n="lb"/>around Sītā. Trijaṭā had a dream one night which is
<div n="lb"/>described in Chapter 27 of Sundara Kāṇḍa thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Śrī Rāma dressed in pure white robes and accom-
<div n="lb"/>panied by Lakṣmaṇa dropped to the place from air in
<div n="lb"/>a chariot built with ivory and drawn by a thousand
<div n="lb"/>swans. After that they came to Sītā on the back of
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata. Śrī Rāmā took Sītā in his lap and rose up
<div n="lb"/>into the air. They went high to reach the Sun and
<div n="lb"/>Sītā was seen patting on the Sun and the moon. Then
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata which was carrying Rāma, Sītā and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa came to the top of Laṅkā. Then they came
<div n="lb"/>to this place in chariot. Then they travelled to the
<div n="lb"/>north in a Puṣpaka vimāna. Rāvaṇa with oil smeared
<div n="lb"/>on his body and looking all red was lying on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. His head was clean shaven. He was drinking
<div n="lb"/>oil from a pot and was shouting loudly. Then Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to the south on the back of a donkey. When
<div n="lb"/>he had travelled a short distance he fell from the
<div n="lb"/>donkey head downwards. Rising from there he was
<div n="lb"/>muttering many vulgar words. Then Rāvaṇa sank
<div n="lb"/>into a foul-smelling dung-mire. A black woman
<div n="lb"/>wearing a red saree and mud smeared all over her
<div n="lb"/>body came near him and dragged him to the south.
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa also was subjected to her torture. All
<div n="lb"/>the members of Rāvaṇa's family were seen smeared
<div n="lb"/>with oil. After that they all travelled south again.
<div n="lb"/>At that time Rāvaṇa was seen on the back of a hog,
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa on the back of a camel and Indrajit
<div n="lb"/>on the back of a crocodile. Vibhīṣaṇa alone was seen
<div n="lb"/>standing near the Puṣpaka Vimāna on the back of
<div n="lb"/>a four-tusked elephant wearing white robes and
<div n="lb"/>white garlands and sweet-smelling pastes smeared all
<div n="lb"/>over his body and holding a white umbrella with the
<div n="lb"/>four ministers by his side and the royal band playing.
<div n="lb"/>At that stage the beautiful city of Laṅkā with its whole
<div n="lb"/>army fell into the ocean. Then a monkey messenger
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Rāma burnt the city of Laṅkā. All the women
<div n="lb"/>demonesses and Kumbhakarṇa were seen lying in a cow-
<div n="lb"/>dung pit wearing red dress.”

<div n="lb"/>When Trijaṭā repeated her dream to her companions
<div n="lb"/>all were frightened to death. After the Rāma-Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>battle, it is stated in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, that Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma gave presents to Trijaṭā. (Śloka 41, Chapter 291,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva).
