DUŚŚĀSANA II¦. Another Duśśāsana, servant of the
<div n="lb"/>son of King Khaḍgabāhu of Saurāṣṭra is also mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Khaḍgabāhu had a famous elephant, which one night
<div n="lb"/>broke its chains and escaped, and all the mahouts
<div n="lb"/>could not chain it again. People in terror of the elephant
<div n="lb"/>ran helter-skelter. Now, a brahmin was going that way
<div n="lb"/>chanting verses of the 16th Chapter of the Gītā, and even
<div n="lb"/>though the mahouts warned him he did not change
<div n="lb"/>his path. Instead he saluted the elephant by touching
<div n="lb"/>its cheeks and proceeded on his way unhurt by the ani-
<div n="lb"/>mal. The King felt great respect for the brahmin when
<div n="lb"/>he was told that he owed his miraculous powers to
<div n="lb"/>the 16th chapter of the Gītā, and he took the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>with him to his palace. The King gave him 100,000 golden
<div n="lb"/>coins and received from him the Gītā mantra. He began
<div n="lb"/>reciting daily certain verses in the 16th Chapter of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavadgītā.
<div n="NI"/>Some time afterwards the King one day went to an
<div n="lb"/>open ground near his palace accompanied by soldi-
<div n="lb"/>ers and set the elephant free from its chain. Then,
<div n="lb"/>unheeding the entreaties of the frightened people he
<div n="lb"/>approached the elephant, saluted it by touching its
<div n="lb"/>cheeks and came away unhurt. He could act in this
<div n="lb"/>fashion because of his firm faith in the efficacy of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavadgītā. And afterwards he placed his son, on the
<div n="lb"/>throne and himself led a life of recluse repeating the
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavadgītā.
<div n="NI"/>Some Purāṇas have another version of this episode.
<div n="lb"/>Duśśāsana was a servant of Khaḍgabāhu's son and he
<div n="lb"/>attempted to catch the elephant but was killed
<div n="lb"/>by it. He attained salvation by hearing the 17th Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter of the Bhagavadgītā.
<div n="NI"/>Duśśāsana, an idiot, betting a huge sum of money with
<div n="lb"/>the junior mahouts of the elephant and unheeding the
<div n="lb"/>warnings of several people once mounted the elephant.
<div n="lb"/>Children agitated the animal and Duśśāsana fell down
<div n="lb"/>from its back. The angry animal stamped the fool to
[Page264-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>death, and its rage having not yet subsided it threw
<div n="lb"/>around his bones. Duśśāsana, who ended his life thus
<div n="lb"/>was reborn as an elephant and was owned by King
<div n="lb"/>Jayadeva of Ceylon for a long time. A great friend of
<div n="lb"/>King Khaḍgabāhu, Jayadeva presented the elephant
<div n="lb"/>to him. At the sight of its brothers and other relations
<div n="lb"/>memory about its previous birth dawned on the eleph-
<div n="lb"/>ant. And, it lived in great grief. After some days the
<div n="lb"/>King presented the animal to a poet pleased at his
<div n="lb"/>samasyāpūraṇa (filling the three lines of a stanza in
<div n="lb"/>tune with the fourth line given). The poet sold the
<div n="lb"/>elephant to the King of Mālava as it got ill with
<div n="lb"/>fever. In spite of the best treatment administered to it
<div n="lb"/>the elephant seemed to be nearing its end. Without
<div n="lb"/>either eating or drinking or sleeping the animal stood
<div n="lb"/>motionless shedding tears day and night. One
<div n="lb"/>day, the Mālava King visited the elephant when,
<div n="lb"/>to the surprise of all assembled there, the elephant
<div n="lb"/>spoke to the King thus: “Oh, King: if a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>recites the 17th Chapter of the Bhagavadgītā I will
<div n="lb"/>be completely cured of my illness.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly a brahmin was brought. As soon as he
<div n="lb"/>chanted the Gītā and sprinkled water on its head it
<div n="lb"/>got rid of its animalhood, ascended the divine aero-
<div n="lb"/>plane and shone forth like Indra. The Mālava King
<div n="lb"/>also began daily reciting the Bhagavadgītā and within a
<div n="lb"/>short time afterwards attained salvation. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 8).
