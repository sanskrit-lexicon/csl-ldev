CANDRASVĀMĪ¦. A brahmin, who got back his life by
<div n="lb"/>worshipping Sūrya. He stayed with his wife, Devamatī
<div n="lb"/>in Kamalapura ruled by King Kamalavarman. A son
<div n="lb"/>called Mahīpāla was born to him, and at the time of the
<div n="lb"/>birth of the child a celestial voice declared that Mahīpāla
<div n="lb"/>would become King. A few years later a daughter called
<div n="lb"/>Candramatī also was born to Candrasvāmī.
[Page175-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>During this period, rains having failed, very severe
<div n="lb"/>famine stalked Kamalapura. Even the king unmindful of
<div n="lb"/>justice and righteousness began extracting from the
<div n="lb"/>people whatever they possessed. Finding the situation
<div n="lb"/>deteriorated so much Candrasvāmī set out for his father-
<div n="lb"/>in-law's house with Mahīpāla and Candramatī, and on
<div n="lb"/>the way they had to cross what was once a wild forest,
<div n="lb"/>but which had by then been denuded of green trees or
<div n="lb"/>other foliage due to the failure of the rains. The children
<div n="lb"/>were severely afflicted by thirst, and so the father, after
<div n="lb"/>leaving them at the foot of a tree went in search of water
<div n="lb"/>when he was caught by the people of the forest king and
<div n="lb"/>taken before him. When he knew that he was about to
<div n="lb"/>be given in sacrifice to Devī the brahmin folded his
<div n="lb"/>hands and prayed to Sūryadeva, who appeared before
<div n="lb"/>him and assured him that not only will death not visit
<div n="lb"/>him, but also he would be united with his wife and
<div n="lb"/>children.
<div n="NI"/>The children left under the tree began crying, their
<div n="lb"/>father having not returned to them, and a Vaiśya called
<div n="lb"/>Sārthadhāra who came that way felt pity for the crying
<div n="lb"/>children and took them to his house. One day
<div n="lb"/>Anantasvāmī, a brahmin and a minister of King
<div n="lb"/>Tārānātha of Tārāpura happened to visit Sārthadhāra.
<div n="lb"/>Anantasvāmī, who had no children of his own took away
<div n="lb"/>with him the children from Sārthadhāra.
<div n="NI"/>One day Sūryadeva appeared to the forest king in his
<div n="lb"/>sleep and asked him not to kill the brahmin (Candra-
<div n="lb"/>svāmi) held captive by him. The very next morning
<div n="lb"/>Candrasvāmī was released from captivity. Roaming
<div n="lb"/>about in quest of his children, Candrasvāmī reached the
<div n="lb"/>city called Jalapura where he was put up as the guest
<div n="lb"/>of a house-holder. One day the host told Candrasvāmī
<div n="lb"/>that a vaiśya called Kanakavarman had, a few days back,
<div n="lb"/>told him that he (Kanakavarman) had got two children,
<div n="lb"/>one male and the other female from the forest, and taken
<div n="lb"/>them to the Nālikera island. The very next day Candra-
<div n="lb"/>svāmī, along with a vaiśya called Viṣṇuvarman arrived
<div n="lb"/>at the Nālikera island, and on enquiry they were told
<div n="lb"/>that Kanakavarman, with the children had left for
<div n="lb"/>Kaṭāha island. They then went to Kaṭāha island only
<div n="lb"/>to be told that Kanakavarman had gone to Karpūra
<div n="lb"/>island. With another Vaiśya Candrasvāmi landed on the
<div n="lb"/>Karpūra island to no purpose. After thus going to the
<div n="lb"/>Suvarṇa and Siṃhala islands too Candrasvāmi met
<div n="lb"/>Kanakavarman at Citrakūṭapura. Kanakavarman
<div n="lb"/>showed the children to Candrasvāmi, but they were not
<div n="lb"/>his. He burst into tears, and returned from Citrakūṭa-
<div n="lb"/>pura. He passed on his way back many a temple and
<div n="lb"/>city and at dusk reached a big forest. He satisfied his
<div n="lb"/>hunger by eating some roots and fruits, and got upon
<div n="lb"/>a tree and sat on the top of it. It was mid-night, yet
<div n="lb"/>sleep did not oblige him. Then he saw a mātṛsaṅgha
<div n="lb"/>(a group of women) consisting of Nārāyaṇī and others
<div n="lb"/>come and dance at the foot of the tree. Nārāyaṇī saw
<div n="lb"/>Candrasvāmī and after the dance was over and her
<div n="lb"/>companions had left the place Nārāyaṇī called him down
<div n="lb"/>from the tree and gave him a flower. And, according
<div n="lb"/>to the advice of Nārāyaṇī the next day morning Candra-
<div n="lb"/>svāmī went to Tārāpura where, accidentally he got into
<div n="lb"/>the house of Anantasvāmī, minister of the kingdom, and,
<div n="lb"/>for food, repeated vedic hymns. The minister invited him
<div n="lb"/>for meals, and there he saw Mahīpāla and Candrāvatī.
<div n="lb"/>He placed the flower presented by Nārāyaṇī on Mahī-
<div n="lb"/>pāla's nose whereupon the children recognised him,
[Page176-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>their father. The people celebrated it as a happy day.
<div n="lb"/>King Tārāvarman gave his daughter, Vasumatī, in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to Mahīpāla along with half his kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>They went to Kamalapura and returned with their
<div n="lb"/>mother. All of them spent their days very happily at
<div n="lb"/>Tārāpura. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Alaṅkāravatī Laṃbaka,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 6).
