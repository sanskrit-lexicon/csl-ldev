ṚṢI¦. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 348 states that the letter
<div n="lb"/>“Ṛ” means “sound”. The word “Ṛṣi” is derived from
<div n="lb"/>this root. During the period when the art of writing
<div n="lb"/>was not known, Vedas, Śāstras and other sacred lore
<div n="lb"/>were communicated through the mouth of the Ṛṣis.
<div n="lb"/>The voice of Āṛṣa Bhārata itself is the voice of the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣis. Hindus believe that the Vedas are the outcome
<div n="lb"/>of the inspiration, introspection and spiritual vision of
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛṣis. There is a Saṃskṛta stanza defining a Ṛṣi,
<div n="lb"/>which is given below:
<Poem>Ūrdhvaretāstapasyāgaḥ
<div n="lb"/>Niyatāśī ca saṃyamī /
<div n="lb"/>Śāpānugrahayoḥ śaktaḥ
<div n="lb"/>Satyasandho bhavedṛṣiḥ //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>India has given birth to numerous Ṛṣis. The word
<div n="lb"/>“Ṛṣi” may be found throughout the Vedas. Ṛṣis born
<div n="lb"/>in all classes of people had lived in India. The general
<div n="lb"/>belief is that the number of Ṛṣis may come to about
<div n="lb"/>48,000. It is not possible to know the names of all of them.
<div n="lb"/>In the Rāmāyaṇa we find that when Śrī Rāma returned
<div n="lb"/>to Ayodhyā after his life in the forest and took up the
<div n="lb"/>reign, many Ṛṣis came to Ayodhyā from all parts of
<div n="lb"/>the country. Among them, Viśvāmitra, Yavakrīta,
<div n="lb"/>Raibhya, Kaṇva and Garga came with their party of
<div n="lb"/>disciples from the east; Dattātreya, Namuci, Pramuci,
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki, Soma, Kuṇḍu and Agastya came with their
<div n="lb"/>disciples from the south; Vṛṣaṅgu, Kaviṣa, Kaumya,

<div n="lb"/>Raudreya, Nārada, Vāmadeva, Saubhari, Aṣṭāvakra,
<div n="lb"/>Śuka, Bhṛgu, Lomaśa, Maudgalya and others with their
<div n="lb"/>disciples came from the west and Kaśyapa, Vasiṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>Atri, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvāja, Sanaka and
<div n="lb"/>party, Śarabhaṅga, Durvāsas, Mātaṅga, Vibhāṇḍaka,
<div n="lb"/>Tumburu, the Saptarṣis and others with their party of
<div n="lb"/>disciples arrived from the north, according to Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa. There are three classes of Ṛṣis—Brahmarṣi,
<div n="lb"/>Rājarṣi and Devarṣi. Vasiṣṭha was a Brahmarṣi,
<div n="lb"/>Visvāmitra, a Rajarṣi and Kaśyapa, a Devarṣi.
