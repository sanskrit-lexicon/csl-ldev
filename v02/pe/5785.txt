ṚṢI¦. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 348 states that the letter
“Ṛ” means “sound”. The word “Ṛṣi” is derived from
this root. During the period when the art of writing
was not known, Vedas, Śāstras and other sacred lore
were communicated through the mouth of the Ṛṣis.
The voice of Āṛṣa Bhārata itself is the voice of the
Ṛṣis. Hindus believe that the Vedas are the outcome
of the inspiration, introspection and spiritual vision of
the Ṛṣis. There is a Saṃskṛta stanza defining a Ṛṣi,
which is given below:

<div n="NI"/>India has given birth to numerous Ṛṣis. The word
“Ṛṣi” may be found throughout the Vedas. Ṛṣis born
in all classes of people had lived in India. The general
belief is that the number of Ṛṣis may come to about
48,000. It is not possible to know the names of all of them.
In the Rāmāyaṇa we find that when Śrī Rāma returned
to Ayodhyā after his life in the forest and took up the
reign, many Ṛṣis came to Ayodhyā from all parts of
the country. Among them, Viśvāmitra, Yavakrīta,
Raibhya, Kaṇva and Garga came with their party of
disciples from the east; Dattātreya, Namuci, Pramuci,
Vālmīki, Soma, Kuṇḍu and Agastya came with their
disciples from the south; Vṛṣaṅgu, Kaviṣa, Kaumya,

Raudreya, Nārada, Vāmadeva, Saubhari, Aṣṭāvakra,
Śuka, Bhṛgu, Lomaśa, Maudgalya and others with their
disciples came from the west and Kaśyapa, Vasiṣṭha,
Atri, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvāja, Sanaka and
party, Śarabhaṅga, Durvāsas, Mātaṅga, Vibhāṇḍaka,
Tumburu, the Saptarṣis and others with their party of
disciples arrived from the north, according to Uttara
Rāmāyaṇa. There are three classes of Ṛṣis—Brahmarṣi,
Rājarṣi and Devarṣi. Vasiṣṭha was a Brahmarṣi,
Visvāmitra, a Rajarṣi and Kaśyapa, a Devarṣi.
