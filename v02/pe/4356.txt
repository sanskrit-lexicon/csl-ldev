MAṄKAṆAKA¦ (MAṄKAṆA). A sage
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} He was born to Vāyubhagavān
of his wife Sukanyakā. (Śloka. 58, Chapter 38, Śalya
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana Purāṇa, 38th Chapter states that Maṅkaṇa
was one of the spiritual sons of Kaśyapaprajāpati.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Juice of potherb flows from finger.%} The sage was living
in Saptasārasvatatīrtha and one day by accident his
thumb was cut off from his hand by the sharp edge of
Kuśa grass. But instead of blood, the juice of potherb
began to flow from the thumb and the sage, overjoyed
at this strange phenomenon, started dancing. Along
with Maṅkaṇa the earth and the sky also started
dancing and the dancing showed no signs of stopping.
Śiva then appeared before Maṅkaṇa and asked him the
cause of his non-stop dancing. Śiva was in disguise and
Maṅkaṇa did not recognise the new-comer and the
sage told him about the strange phenomenon. As they
were talking Śiva touched the thumb of the sage with
his little finger and lo! the flow from the finger changed
from pot-herb juice to sugar-candy juice. Vāmana
Purāṇa states that it was ashes which flowed from the
finger. The hermit was ashamed. He understood that
the guest was Śiva and he fell at his feet. Śiva blessed
the hermit and granted him boons.
