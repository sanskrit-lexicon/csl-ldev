MAṄKAṆAKA¦ (MAṄKAṆA). A sage
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} He was born to Vāyubhagavān
<div n="lb"/>of his wife Sukanyakā. (Śloka. 58, Chapter 38, Śalya
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana Purāṇa, 38th Chapter states that Maṅkaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was one of the spiritual sons of Kaśyapaprajāpati.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Juice of potherb flows from finger.%} The sage was living
<div n="lb"/>in Saptasārasvatatīrtha and one day by accident his
<div n="lb"/>thumb was cut off from his hand by the sharp edge of
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa grass. But instead of blood, the juice of potherb
<div n="lb"/>began to flow from the thumb and the sage, overjoyed
<div n="lb"/>at this strange phenomenon, started dancing. Along
<div n="lb"/>with Maṅkaṇa the earth and the sky also started
<div n="lb"/>dancing and the dancing showed no signs of stopping.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva then appeared before Maṅkaṇa and asked him the
<div n="lb"/>cause of his non-stop dancing. Śiva was in disguise and
<div n="lb"/>Maṅkaṇa did not recognise the new-comer and the
<div n="lb"/>sage told him about the strange phenomenon. As they
<div n="lb"/>were talking Śiva touched the thumb of the sage with
<div n="lb"/>his little finger and lo! the flow from the finger changed
<div n="lb"/>from pot-herb juice to sugar-candy juice. Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa states that it was ashes which flowed from the
<div n="lb"/>finger. The hermit was ashamed. He understood that
<div n="lb"/>the guest was Śiva and he fell at his feet. Śiva blessed
<div n="lb"/>the hermit and granted him boons.

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Maṅkaṇa falls in love with Sarasvatī Devī.%} One day
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatīdevī came to the place of his residence in the
<div n="lb"/>guise of a very attractive woman. Maṅkaṇa had seminal
<div n="lb"/>emission on seeing her and the semen fell on the surface
<div n="lb"/>of the water. The sage stored the water with semen
<div n="lb"/>in a pot and soon seven sons were born from it. They
<div n="lb"/>all became sages named Vāyuvega, Vāyubala,
<div n="lb"/>Vāyuhā, Vāyumaṇḍala, Vāyujvāla, Vāyuretas and
<div n="lb"/>Vāyucakra. (Chapter 83, Vana Parva and Chapter 38,
<div n="lb"/>Śalya Parva).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Kadalīgarbhā.%} Besides the seven sons
<div n="lb"/>Maṅkaṇa got a daughter named Kadalīgarbhā. Menakā
<div n="lb"/>was her mother. (See under Kadalīgarbhā).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Maṅkaṇa diverts the river Sarasvatī.%} It was sage
<div n="lb"/>Maṅkaṇa who invoked the river Sarasvatī and made
<div n="lb"/>it flow through Kurukṣetra. Chapter 38, Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
