YĀJÑAVALKYA¦. An ancient sage who was a profound
scholar.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Purāṇas say that this sage spent the major
part of his life at the court of King Janaka. He was
also King Janaka's priest. In Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 16,
it is mentioned that Kalki was Yājñavalkya's priest.
Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 51,
mentions that Yājñavalkya was a “Brahmavādī son” of
Viśvāmitra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Thousand cows.%} Once King Janaka conducted a
Yāga. At that time he wished to find out the most
eminent among the sages. He promised to present a
thousand cows to the sage who was a consummate
scholar. A bag of gold coins was also tied to each horn
of the cows. Janaka announced that the sage who claim-
ed to be a consummate scholar might come forward and
take the cows with him. No one among the numerous
sages who were present, dared to come forward. Yājña-
valkya, however, ordered his disciple to take the cows
home with him. The other sages questioned his right to
claim the cows. Yājñavalkya asserted his right to do so.
One of the sages named Arthabhāga stood up and
asked him the following question:—
<div n="NI"/>Arthabhāga:—When a man who has not acquired
divine knowledge dies, his “Jñānendriyas” (senses of
knowledge) are also merged with it. How is it possible
for him to accept another body afterwards? “Yājña-
valkya:—Karma (action) becomes the cause of his re-
birth.”
<div n="NI"/>Next Kahola and many other sages put various ques-
tions to him. The substance of their talk is given
below:—
<div n="NI"/>Kahola:—What have you to say about the invisible
and omnipresent Brahman?
<div n="NI"/>Yājñavalkya:—Your soul is the omni-present Brahman.
The soul has no hunger or thirst, fear or desire, old age
or death. Those who wish to know the soul, become
sages after transcending love of wife, children or world-
ly riches. The two qualities essential for sages are
scholarship and spiritual knowledge.
<div n="NI"/>Gārgī:—Who is the warp and woof of everything?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—It is Brahman. Do not ask further; if you do,
your head will be broken to pieces.
<div n="NI"/>Āruṇi:—Who is he who exists within? (Antaryāmī).
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—He who is contained in Jagat (the universe)
without the knowledge of Jagat, he whose body is
Jagat, he who controls Jagat as antaryāmī, he is within
every one. He cannot be seen, but he sees. He cannot
[Page891-b+ 65]
be heard; but he hears. He is capable of thinking; but
he is beyond our thoughts. He exists as one who sees,
hears and thinks, in all creatures.
<div n="NI"/>Gārgī:—I have two questions to ask. They are as sharp
and pointed as two arrows. By what force is fixed that
which is above Heaven, below the earth and that
which is between them, like warp and woof?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—By the sky.
<div n="NI"/>Gārgī:—By what force is the sky held in position like
warp and woof?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Under the command of God, the sun and
moon do not deviate from their orbits. The sky and the
earth remain in their respective places. Rivers run mak-
ing the fields fertile. One who lives and works without
the ability to know God does not obtain immortality.
He who dies without knowing God is a Kṛpaṇa (spirit-
ual bankrupt). On the contrary, he who knows God
attains Mokṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Śākalya:—How many gods are there?
<div n="NI"/>Yājṅa:—Thirtythree. They are—8 Vasus, 11 Rudras,
12 Ādityas, Indra and Prajāpati. The 8 Vasus are—
Agni, Pṛthvī, Vāyu, Antarīkṣa, Āditya, Dyau (Heaven),
Candra and Stars. The 11 Rudras are the combination
of the 10 jñānendriyas and the working of the mind.
The ruling deities of the 12 months are known as the
12 Ādityas. They receive into them our lives and our
Karmans (actions).
<div n="NI"/>Yājñavalkya gave suitable answers to all other ques-
tions of Śākalya. At last, he asked Śākalya:—“Now I
will ask you a question. Whom do the Upaniṣads
describe? If you do not answer, your head will break.”
Śākalya could not answer it. He dropped down with a
broken head. He asked the other scholars who had
gathered there, if any of them wanted to ask him more
questions. But no one came forward. All remained
dumb. Then he continued:—“Fresh leaves sprout
from a tree which has been cut. If the seed is destroy-
ed, the tree does not grow out of it. How is it that a
man is born again after his death?”
<div n="NI"/>No one was able to answer that question. Thus after
defeating all of them in argument, Yājñavalkya went
home with the cows.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%In Janaka's court again.%} On another occasion,
Yājñavalkya went to see King Janaka. The King asked
him whether he had come for getting cows or to ask
abstruse question. The sage answered that he had come
for both. Their conversation continued as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Jita Muni has said that “Vacana” (word) is
Brahman or God. What is your opinion?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—It is correct. But did he say which is the body
and abode of God?
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—No.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—In that case he has said only onefourth about
God. Vacana is god's body and sky, his abode. Brahma-
vidyā depends on the word. The word is Parabrahman.
Janaka was highly pleased. He decided to give a thou-
sand bulls to the sage. But Yājñavalkya said that his
father's principle was to give effective knowledge to the
pupil and not to receive any dakṣiṇā (Payment) from
him. Janaka again wanted Yājñavalkya to explain
clearly what “Brahma Vidyā” means.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Just as a person can reach his destination by
walking or by travelling in a chariot or by sailing in a
boat, in order to secure peace for the soul, you are
depending on the Upaniṣads. But although one is
[Page892-a+ 65]
learned in Vedas and Āgamas, or adored by others or
wealthy, or well-versed in Upaniṣads, unless one has
known God—unless one acquired Brahmajñāna—one
cannot be said to be gratified. Do you know where you
will go after renouncing your body?
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—I do not know.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—I shall tell you. The deity of the right eye is
“Inda” (light). People call it “Indra”. The deity of
the left eye is Indrāṇī, the wife of Indra. Indra is eater
and Indrāṇī is food. In a state of consciousness they
are separated. (Then the soul is called Vaiśvānara).
In a state of dream, the two are united. (Then the
soul is called Taijasa). In a state of slumber, the soul
is in “Prjñāa” state. (Since there is no activity it is
called Prājña). In the fourth or “Turīya” state, one
becomes capable of transcending the three other states
and to attain Parabrahman. It is a state of fearlessness
transcending birth and death.
<div n="NI"/>The King who was pleased by this teaching dedicated
the kingdom of Videha and even himself to the sage.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%In Janaka's court for the third time.%} After some years
Yājñavalkya went again to Janaka's court. At that time
also there was a philosophical discussion between the
King and the sage in the form of questions and answers.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Which is the light that gives us guidance
during the day time?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—The Sun.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—After sunset which is the light that guides us?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—The Moon.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—And in the absence of the sun and moon?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Agni.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Which is the light that guides us in the
absence of the sun, moon and Agni?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Vacana.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Which is the light that shines in the absence
of all these luminaries?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—Ātmajyotis (soul's light).
<div n="NI"/>Janaka:—Who is Ātman?
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—“Puruṣa” who is formed by the union of
“vyāna” in prāṇas (lives) and jyotis (light) in the
heart. The soul is disposed to action with the help of
intelligence. In the end it transcends the body, senses
and mind and attains Mokṣa. In the state of conscious-
ness the soul's activities become manifest to us. When
in sleep, after deputing “Prāṇa” for the protection of
the body, the soul remains outside the body. The senses
become inactive. Therefore we should never wake up
one who is asleep. When the soul remains in the body
and the senses are active, it is in a most vigilant state.
Thus the soul is above the states of wakefulness, dream
and slumber. The soul is the divine light of pure
energy.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka who was pleased, gave the sage a thousand
cows more. After that Yājñavalkya spoke about libera-
tion from worldly bonds.
<div n="NI"/>Yājña:—The soul has no connection with the three
conditions. Just as the actions in a dream do not affect
the soul, the actions in a wakeful state also do not
affect it. Just as a fish jumps from one side of the river
to the other and back again, life keeps jumping from
the state of wakefulness to the state of slumber and vice
versa.
<div n="NI"/>Just as a kite goes up flying and then comes back to its
nest, one moves from the state of wakefulness to sleep
and back again. In deep slumber, he merges with God,
[Page892-b+ 64]
but he does not know that. In that state, the father or
the mother does not have the knowledge that they are
the father or mother.
<div n="NI"/>After that Yājñavalkya explained the nature of the soul
and the various aspects of its working in a state of wake-
fulness and of slumber. He added:—“As long as there
is “Kāma” (desire) there is “Karman” also. Life goes
on passing from birth to death and from death to birth.
One attains perfection when one is above all desires,
and acquires the highest divine knowledge. He is liber-
ated from birth and death and becomes immortal.
<div n="NI"/>By jñāna, dāna and tapas we become self-purified and
thus become worthy of the highest divine grace. We
have to go from the world of Karman (action) to the
world of ātman (soul). One who has acquired Brahma-
jñāna (knowledge of Brahman) becomes a Brāhmaṇa.
Hearing these famous teachings of Yājñavalkya, Janaka
became his permanent disciple.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%His end.%} Yājñavalkya had two wives named Kalyāṇī
and Maitreyī. After giving his all to his wives he passed
into immortality. (Bṛhadāraṇyaka; M.B. Śānṭi Parva,
Chapters 3-9).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%His works.%} Yājñavalkya has written a Smṛti on the
subject of law. “Mitākṣarā” is its famous commentary.
Mitākṣarā is the highest authoritative treatise on Law
in South India.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Yājñavalkya flourished in Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly.
(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 12).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) He was also a member of Indra's assembly. (M.B.
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 12).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Yājñavalkya was the priest at the Rājasūya Yajña
of Dharmaputra. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 33,
Verse 35).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Yājñavalkya had his knowledge of Vedas from
Sūryadeva. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 318, Verse 6).
