MṚGAVYĀDHA¦. The disguise Śiva took when he
went to test the devotion of Paraśurāma. Paraśurāma
once went to the forests and did penance to please Śiva
to learn archery from him. Śiva in the form of a
Mṛgavyādha (forest hunter) appeared before Paraśu-
rāma and tested his sincerity in his penance in several
ways. Śiva was pleased to find Paraśurāma's devotion
to Śiva unwavering and blessed him. He gave instruct-
ions in archery and also permitted him to go round the
earth. (Chapter 65, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
