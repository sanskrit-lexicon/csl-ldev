YUKTĀŚVA¦. A sage who was a Sāmavedin. There is a
story about this sage in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa:—
Yuktāśva who was a scholar in Vedas and Śāstras once
abducted two new-born babies and killed them. As a
result of that sin, he lost all his Vedic knowledge. To
recover his lost learning, he started an austere tapas.
After many years of tapas, he got back the whole of his
Vedic knowledge.
