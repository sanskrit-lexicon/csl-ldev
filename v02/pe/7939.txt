<div n="lb"/>situated above the world of Brahmā. This is an island
<div n="lb"/>in the sea of Amṛta with an area of several yojanas. All

<div n="lb"/>seven walls of bronze, copper, lead, brass, a mixture of
<div n="lb"/>five metals, silver and gold. They are called Saptaśālas.
<div n="lb"/>Between the walls there are several parks such as Kalpa-

<div n="lb"/>dāravāṭikā, Pārijātavāṭikā, Kadambavāṭī etc. On pas-
<div n="lb"/>sing the seven walls, several houses are seen. They are
<div n="lb"/>topaz-house, jacinth-house, beryl-house, diamond-house,
<div n="lb"/>chrysoprase-house, sapphire-house, ruby-house, emerald-
<div n="lb"/>house, etc. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11).
