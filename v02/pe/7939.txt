VAJRAPRĀSĀDA¦. A house in heaven. Maṇidvīpa is
situated above the world of Brahmā. This is an island
in the sea of Amṛta with an area of several yojanas. All
the sand particles on the shore of the sea of Amṛta are
jewels. Beyond the trees of jewels standing on the sea-
coast, there is an iron-wall with four towers. Those who
come here to see Devī (goddess) should get down from
their vehicles here. Beyond this wall of iron, there are
seven walls of bronze, copper, lead, brass, a mixture of
five metals, silver and gold. They are called Saptaśālas.
Between the walls there are several parks such as Kalpa-
vāṭikā, Santānavāṭikā, Haricandanavṛkṣavāṭikā, Man-
dāravāṭikā, Pārijātavāṭikā, Kadambavāṭī etc. On pas-
sing the seven walls, several houses are seen. They are
topaz-house, jacinth-house, beryl-house, diamond-house,
chrysoprase-house, sapphire-house, ruby-house, emerald-
house, etc. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11).
