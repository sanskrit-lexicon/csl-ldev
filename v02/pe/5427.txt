PṚŚNIGARBHA¦. A name of Mahāviṣṇu. There are
two opinions in the Purāṇas regarding how Viṣṇu got
this name.
<div n="NI"/>1) In the early part of the period of Svāyambhuva
Manu the Prajāpati named Sutapas and his wife Pṛśni
did penance for twelve thousand divine years to get
Viṣṇu as their son. As a result of that Viṣṇu was born
in the womb of Pṛśni as Pṛśnigarbha. The name was
suited for Śrī Kṛṣṇa the incarnation of Viṣṇu also.
(Chapter 3, 10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) Anna (rice), Veda, Jala (water) and amṛta (nectar)
are called Pṛśni and so Mahāviṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa) who bears
these inside is called Pṛśnigarbha. (Śloka 45, Chapter
342, Śānti Parva).
