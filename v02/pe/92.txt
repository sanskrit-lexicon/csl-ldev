<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Ahalyā got a curse and became a stone.%} The story
<div n="lb"/>of how Ahalyā was cursed by her husband, Gautama,
<div n="lb"/>and was turned into a stone is told in different versions
<div n="lb"/>in different purāṇas. The following is the version in the
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. When Viśvāmitra was taking back
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa from the forest to the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Janaka they came across an āśrama on their way. Giving
<div n="lb"/>details about that āśrama Visvāmitra told the princes
<div n="lb"/>thus: “This is the āśrama where the sage, Gautama, was
<div n="lb"/>living with his wife, Ahalyā. Indra fell in love with the
<div n="lb"/>beautiful Ahalyā and while the sage was out for bathing
<div n="lb"/>Indra entered the āśrama in the disguise of the sage
<div n="lb"/>himself and took bed with her. But before Indra could
<div n="lb"/>get out Gautama himself came to the āśrama and en-
<div n="lb"/>raged at what he saw, cursed them both. Indra was to
<div n="lb"/>lose his testicles and Ahalyā was to turn into a stone.
<div n="lb"/>But taking pity on her the sage declared that she would
<div n="lb"/>take her original form the moment Rāma of tretā yuga
<div n="lb"/>came to that place and touched the stone by his foot.
<div n="lb"/>Testicleless Indra went to devaloka and there his friends
<div n="lb"/>feeling sorry for him, substituted a goat's testicle and
<div n="lb"/>got him to normal.” While Viśvāmitra was talking to
<div n="lb"/>the princes, Śrī Rāma's foot touched the stone and Ahalyā
<div n="lb"/>stood up in all beauty. Ahalyā and Gautama lived in
<div n="lb"/>the same āśrama again for another long period.
<div n="NI"/>In Kathāsaritsāgara this story is told in a slightly diffe-
<div n="lb"/>rent yet more interesting way. As soon as Gautama
<div n="lb"/>entered the āśrama Indra turned himself into a cat.
<div n="lb"/>Angrily the sage questioned Ahalyā, “who was standing
<div n="lb"/>here when I came in?” Ahalyā replied, “Eso thiyo khu
<div n="lb"/>majjara” (Eṣaḥ sthitaḥ khalu mārjjāraḥ). It was a cat
<div n="lb"/>which was standing there. Here Ahalyā used a pun on
<div n="lb"/>the word ‘majjara’ and tried to be honest. ‘Majjara’ is
<div n="lb"/>the Prakrit form of the word ‘mārjjāraḥ’ which means cat.
<div n="lb"/>But ‘majjara’ has another meaning also. (ma=mine
<div n="lb"/>jāra=lover i.e. majjāra=my lover). So Ahalyā did not
<div n="lb"/>lie to her husband. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvānakalam-
<div n="lb"/>baka).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Ahalyā happened to bring up the mighty monkeys, Bāli%}
<div n="lb"/>{%and Sugrīva.%} Once Aruṇa, the charioteer of Sūrya (the
<div n="lb"/>Sun) went to devaloka to see the dance of the celestial
<div n="lb"/>maidens there. Since there was no admission to the dance
<div n="lb"/>for men Aruṇa disguised himself as Āruṇidevī and sought
<div n="lb"/>admission; seeing the beautiful form of Āruṇidevī Indra
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with her and that night a child was born to
<div n="lb"/>Indra by her. On the advice of Indra Āruṇidevī took the
<div n="lb"/>child to Ahalyā before daybreak and left it there to be
<div n="lb"/>looked after by her. It was this child which later on
<div n="lb"/>became the famous Bāli.
<div n="NI"/>Aruṇa went a bit late that morning to his master, the
<div n="lb"/>Sun. The latter wanted an explanation and Aruṇa told
<div n="lb"/>him what had happened. The Sun then asked Aruṇa to
<div n="lb"/>become Āruṇidevī again and seeing the enchanting figure
<div n="lb"/>the Sun also got a child of her. This child also was taken
<div n="lb"/>to Ahalyā and it was this child that later on became the
<div n="lb"/>famous Sugrīva.
