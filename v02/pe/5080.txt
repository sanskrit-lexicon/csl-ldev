PARVATA II¦. It is believed that in Kṛtayuga all
<div n="lb"/>mountains had wings. They flew all over the world
<div n="lb"/>with the swiftness of Garuḍa or Vāyu. All beings
<div n="lb"/>including ṛṣis and devas lived in a state of suspense
<div n="lb"/>since at any moment any mountain might fly and land
<div n="lb"/>down on their heads. They complained to Indra and
<div n="lb"/>Indra asked the mountains to remain at one place
<div n="lb"/>which they flatly refused. Indra got angry and started
<div n="lb"/>cutting down the wings of the mountains with his
<div n="lb"/>Vajrāyudha. No mountain was able to escape from
<div n="lb"/>this punishment; but Vāyubhagavān carried away his
<div n="lb"/>bosom friend, the mountain Maināka, and put it in
<div n="lb"/>the ocean without anybody noticing it. So Maināka
[Page576-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>alone did not lose its wings. It was this Maināka
<div n="lb"/>which rose from the ocean and gave a resting point to
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān, son of Vāyu, when he took a leap from the
<div n="lb"/>shores of Bhārata to Laṅkā. This was but an expression
<div n="lb"/>of gratitude to Vāyu whose son Hanūmān was, for the
<div n="lb"/>help he had given when Indra was cutting off the
<div n="lb"/>wings of all mountains. (Sarga 1, Sundara Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
