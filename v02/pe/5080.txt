PARVATA II¦. It is believed that in Kṛtayuga all
mountains had wings. They flew all over the world
with the swiftness of Garuḍa or Vāyu. All beings
including ṛṣis and devas lived in a state of suspense
since at any moment any mountain might fly and land
down on their heads. They complained to Indra and
Indra asked the mountains to remain at one place
which they flatly refused. Indra got angry and started
cutting down the wings of the mountains with his
Vajrāyudha. No mountain was able to escape from
this punishment; but Vāyubhagavān carried away his
bosom friend, the mountain Maināka, and put it in
the ocean without anybody noticing it. So Maināka
[Page576-a+ 64]
alone did not lose its wings. It was this Maināka
which rose from the ocean and gave a resting point to
Hanūmān, son of Vāyu, when he took a leap from the
shores of Bhārata to Laṅkā. This was but an expression
of gratitude to Vāyu whose son Hanūmān was, for the
help he had given when Indra was cutting off the
wings of all mountains. (Sarga 1, Sundara Kāṇḍa,
Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
