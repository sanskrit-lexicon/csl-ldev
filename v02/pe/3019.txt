JYEṢṬHĀ I¦. A deity of inauspicious things. In Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, it is observed that Jyeṣṭhā
was a goddess obtained by churning the Sea of Milk.
As soon as she came up from the sea of Milk, the
Trimūrtis (Viṣṇu, Brahmā and Śiva) found her and
sent her away ordering her to sit in inauspicious places.
The Goddess Jyeṣṭhā came out of the Milk-Sea before
the goddess Lakṣmī. So this deity is considered the
elder sister of Lakṣmī. As she is the elder she is also
called Mūdhevī (Mūdevī). The mode of worshipping
this goddess is given in Bodhāyana Sūtra. Tondiraṭipoti-
ālvār, who was a Vaiṣṇava Ālvār, who lived in 7th
century A.D. said that it was useless to worship this
Goddess. Ancient images of this Goddess have been
found. But worship of Jyeṣṭhā was completely disconti-
nued after the 10th century.
<div n="NI"/>In Śaiva Purāṇas it is mentioned that this Goddess
is one of the eight portions of Parāśakti. It was believed
that the powers of this Goddess regulated human lives
in various ways.
