HAVYA¦¤GHNA. A Rākṣasa about whom the following
story is told in the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Havyaghna was born from the smoke which rose from
the fire of a yajña which sage Bharadvāja along with
his wife Paiṭhīnasī conducted on the banks of river
Gautamī, and he began eating the havis. Questioned
about it by Bharadvāja Havyaghna answered as
follows:—“I am an unfortunate fellow called Kṛṣṇa
cursed by Brahmā. If you would kindly sprinkle on me
the Gaṅgā water, Suvarṇa, ghee and soma I will be
redeemed from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>Bharadvāja complied with the request of Havyaghna
and he got redemption from the curse.
