BHARADVĀJA I¦. Another name of Dīrghatamas.
<F>**) Dīrghatamas is also called Bharadvāja. But the Bharadvāja of purāṇic fame is not Dīrghatamas. Dīrghatamas is the son whom
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati illegitimately got of Mamatā, his brother's wife. There was then another legitimate child in the womb of Mamatā. Knowing this
<div n="lb"/>the devas told her ‘Bharadvāja’ meaning ‘bear the brunt of two’ and so the son of Bṛhaspati got the name of Bharadvāja also. The real
<div n="lb"/>name of this son was Dīrghatamas or Vitatha. Dīrghatamas is not the Bharadvāja who was the father of Droṇa. The famous Bharadvāja
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Atri. Dīrghatamas or Vitatha was the adopted son of Bharata, son of Duṣyanta. (Bhāgavata and Kamparāmāyaṇa. For
<div n="lb"/>details see under Bharata I and Dīrghatamas.</F>
