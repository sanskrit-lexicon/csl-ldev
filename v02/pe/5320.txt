PRĀṆADHARA¦. A carpenter of Purāṇic fame.
<div n="NI"/>There were two celebrated carpenters in the country of
<div n="lb"/>Kāñcī named Prāṇadhara and Rājyadhara when King
<div n="lb"/>Bāhubala was ruling that country. They learnt many
<div n="lb"/>mechanical arts in carpentry and architecture from the
<div n="lb"/>great architect, Mayāsura. Prāṇadhara, the elder
<div n="lb"/>brother, became an addict to wine and women and
<div n="lb"/>gambling and lost all his wealth. Rājyadhara gave a
<div n="lb"/>portion of his wealth to his brother and before long
<div n="lb"/>both became poor. Then Prāṇadhara found out a plan
<div n="lb"/>and they both together made a mechanical bird and tying
<div n="lb"/>a rope to its legs sent it into the treasure-house of the
<div n="lb"/>King through a window. The bird picked up diamonds
<div n="lb"/>or ornaments which it could carry in its beak and came
<div n="lb"/>back to them. This continued daily for some days and
<div n="lb"/>then Rājyadhara advised his brother to stop it acquaint-
<div n="lb"/>ing him with the dangers if it was ever found out.
<div n="lb"/>But Prāṇadhara did not heed the advice and continued
<div n="lb"/>the theft. When the keeper of the treasury found things
<div n="lb"/>missing he was worried. He mused: “Doors are not
<div n="lb"/>open. Can it be rats? No, there has never been a single
<div n="lb"/>rat here before. Then how did it happen?” Thinking
<div n="lb"/>thus he went and reported the matter to the king. The
[Page603-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>King was confident of the keeper. Soon he put guards over
<div n="lb"/>the treasure-house to keep watch over it at night. Little
<div n="lb"/>knowing that he was being watched Prāṇadhara put
<div n="lb"/>his bird into action that night also. The watchmen
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of the rope as soon as the bird came out with
<div n="lb"/>the booty from the treasure-house. Prāṇadhara knew
<div n="lb"/>that the trick had been found out and he rushed to
<div n="lb"/>his brother and told him what had happened. Immedi-
<div n="lb"/>ately Prāṇadhara made a Vimāna and escaped from the
<div n="lb"/>place with his family. Rājyadhara also made a Vimāna
<div n="lb"/>and escaped. When he had travelled in the Vimāna for
<div n="lb"/>four hundred Kātas (Kāta=four miles) he reached a
<div n="lb"/>sea-shore and then leaving the Vimāna there started
<div n="lb"/>walking. On the way getting tired he slept inside a
<div n="lb"/>garden. When he woke up, a man on a peacock came to
<div n="lb"/>his side and said “You live here. When you are hungry
<div n="lb"/>and feel like taking food go to the second floor of this
<div n="lb"/>house and you will find there whatever you want.”
<div n="lb"/>The visitor disappeared and he found a house in front
<div n="lb"/>of him. When he had finished his daily ablutions he
<div n="lb"/>went inside the house which was empty. But when he
<div n="lb"/>went up he saw ample food in gold vessels arranged there.
<div n="lb"/>He never heard about his brother again. (Taraṅga 9,
<div n="lb"/>Ratnaprabhālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
