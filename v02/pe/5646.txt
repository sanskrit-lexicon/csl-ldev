RĀMA¦ (ŚRĪ RĀMA). The seventh incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu, a very powerful king of the solar dynasty.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Reason for his birth.%} When Rāvaṇa was ruling over
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā as a terror to the world, evils and cruelties like
<div n="lb"/>matricide, patricide, fratricide, killing of cows, hatred
<div n="lb"/>for good people, children's death, abduction of women,
<div n="lb"/>killing of munis, thefts etc. became rampant. When the
<div n="lb"/>world became grief-stricken Bhūmidevī (Goddess of
<div n="lb"/>earth) assumed the form of a cow and took refuge with
<div n="lb"/>Indra in Svarga. She told him about the atrocities
<div n="lb"/>committed by Rāvaṇa and the other Rākṣasas. Then
<div n="lb"/>Indra took Bhūmidevī (cow) to Brahmā, who took
<div n="lb"/>them to Śiva at Kailāsa as killing Rāvaṇa was beyond
<div n="lb"/>his (Brahmā's) power. Śiva thought it improper on
<div n="lb"/>his part to kill Rāvaṇa and so he took Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>others to Viṣṇu and submitted their grievance to him.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu consoled them by saying as follows:—“I have
<div n="lb"/>decided to incarnate myself as the son of Daśaratha, king
<div n="lb"/>of Ayodhyā. You Devas also should take birth on earth
<div n="lb"/>to help me to kill Rāvaṇa and other evil Rākṣasas and
<div n="lb"/>to protect Bhūmidevī and the good people on the
<div n="lb"/>earth.” (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Pūrva Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth%} King Daśaratha of the solar dynasty ruled
<div n="lb"/>Kosala with Ayodhyā as his capital. Maharṣi Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>was his family preceptor. With the cooperation of
<div n="lb"/>eight ministers such as Sumantra and others he ruled
<div n="lb"/>the country in the path of supreme welfare and pros-
<div n="lb"/>perity. A daughter, Śāntā, was born to him of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā. Years passed by, yet he had no son. One
<div n="lb"/>of those days King Lomapāda, close friend of Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>visited Ayodhyā. Lomapāda, who was childless
<div n="lb"/>requested Dasaratha for Śāntā and she was given
<div n="lb"/>as his adopted daughter by Daśaratha. Lomapāda gave
<div n="lb"/>her in marriage to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, who had once caused
<div n="lb"/>rain-fall in Aṅga. (For details see under Ṛṣyaśṛṅga).
[Page631-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>To have a son, Daśaratha took as his second wife
<div n="lb"/>Kaikeyī, daughter of the King of Kekaya and younger
<div n="lb"/>sister of Yudhājit. But she turned out to be barren.
<div n="lb"/>Then he married Sumitrā, daughter of the King of
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī. Even after many years none of the three wives
<div n="lb"/>of Daśaratha presented him with a son.
<div n="NI"/>One of those days Da aratha went deep into the forest,
<div n="lb"/>hunting. While resting on the banks of river Sarayū
<div n="lb"/>he heard a sound like that of an elephant drinking
<div n="lb"/>water in the river. Without realising the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>voice was that of the son of a muni filling water in a
<div n="lb"/>pot for his aged parents, the King released an arrow
<div n="lb"/>against him. When Da aratha walked to the spot, he
<div n="lb"/>realised his mistake. He had hit unknowingly a brahmin-
<div n="lb"/>boy, a muni's son. The boy lay wounded about to
<div n="lb"/>die. The boy explained to Daśaratha who he was and
<div n="lb"/>how he had come to the river to carry water to his
<div n="lb"/>aged parents. After telling the King details about him
<div n="lb"/>he breathed his last. Sobbing at his misadventure,
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha went to the aged parents of the dead boy
<div n="lb"/>with the pot filled with water. The parents, who were
<div n="lb"/>blind thought that it was their son who was
<div n="lb"/>approaching them when Daśaratha revealed the sad
<div n="lb"/>story to them. After cursing Daśaratha that he too
<div n="lb"/>would die of separation from his son, the aged muni
<div n="lb"/>expired; his wife also died in his funeral pyre. The
<div n="lb"/>grief-stricken King returned to Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>Only Vasiṣṭha and Sumantra were told about the
<div n="lb"/>curse, which, though a cause for great sorrow, implied
<div n="lb"/>that Daśaratha would have sons. Vasiṣṭha, therefore,
<div n="lb"/>advised Da aratha to get the yajña, called putrakāmeṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>performed by Ṛṣya ṛṅga. Accordingly the King invited
<div n="lb"/>his daughter Śāntā and his son-in-law, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga
<div n="lb"/>to Ayodhyā, and the yajña began. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga made
<div n="lb"/>offerings in the sacred fire chanting the putrakāma
<div n="lb"/>hymn. Then a divine person arose from the fire with a
<div n="lb"/>golden vessel full of pudding (nectar of the Devas) and
<div n="lb"/>disappeared again in the fire after giving the vessel to
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga handed it over to Daśara-
<div n="lb"/>tha, who as advised by the maharṣi divided the pudd-
<div n="lb"/>ing between Kausalyā and Kaikeyī. They gave a part
<div n="lb"/>of their shares of the pudding to Sumitrā also. The
<div n="lb"/>three queens conceived, and in due course of time
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā and Kaikeyī delivered a son each and
<div n="lb"/>Sumitrā two sons. The son of Kausalyā was named
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, the son of Kaikeyī, Bharata, and sons of Sumitrā
<div n="lb"/>were named Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boons granted to Kaikeyi.%} Before the sons were born to
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha, the mighty asura called Śambara once
<div n="lb"/>attacked Devaloka. Daśaratha was at that time known
<div n="lb"/>as Nemi, and he was a great friend of Indra, and on
<div n="lb"/>his invitation Nemi, along with Kaikeyī, went to
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka in a chariot. Nemi killed the asura army
<div n="lb"/>within half an hour. Then Śambara assumed the
<div n="lb"/>form of ten Śambaras and attacked Nemi from ten
<div n="lb"/>points. In this context Nemi turned and twisted his
<div n="lb"/>chariot in all the ten directions at the same time and
<div n="lb"/>killed all the ten Śambaras and recaptured Svarga. It
<div n="lb"/>was from that day onwards that Nemi came to be known
<div n="lb"/>as Daśaratha.
<div n="NI"/>In the fight with the Sambaras on all points Daśaratha's
<div n="lb"/>chariot was so violently shaken that the key of its axle
<div n="lb"/>was about to slip off and fall down. Noticing the
<div n="lb"/>threatened danger Kaikeyī applied her finger to the
[Page632-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>proper place of the axle and thus averted the mishap.
<div n="lb"/>When Daśaratha knew about this timely action of
<div n="lb"/>Kaikeyī he was so very pleased that he asked her to
<div n="lb"/>choose any two boons she desired, and she asked him
<div n="lb"/>to keep the boons with him to be granted whenever
<div n="lb"/>she requested for them. Daśaratha and Kaikeyī took
<div n="lb"/>leave of Indra and returned to Ayodhyā. (Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%In the company of Viśvāmitra.%} The four sons of
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha grew up in Ayodhyā. Though they were
<div n="lb"/>equally friendly to one another, intimacy between Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa and also between Bharata and Śatrughna
<div n="lb"/>came to be thicker. Once Viśvāmitra decided to con-
<div n="lb"/>duct a yajña for the happiness and contentment of all
<div n="lb"/>people. At the very commencement of the yajña, Rākṣasas,
<div n="lb"/>in batches, tried to spoil it, and Mārīca and Subāhu,
<div n="lb"/>sons of Tāṭakā were the leaders of the obstructionists.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra knew that Rāma was the most effective
<div n="lb"/>weapon against the Rākṣasas and requested Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>to lend him Rāma's help. Daśaratha felt sad about it
<div n="lb"/>and Viśvāmitra was getting excited over the former's
<div n="lb"/>attitude when Vasiṣṭha advised Daśaratha to send Rāma
<div n="lb"/>along with Viśvāmitra. Accordingly Daśaratha sent
<div n="lb"/>Rāma to the forest in the company of Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa too followed his brother.
<div n="NI"/>While walking in the forest Viśvāmitra related many
<div n="lb"/>old stories to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. They crossed
<div n="lb"/>river Sarayū, passed by many āśramas of munis and
<div n="lb"/>reached the Pāla forest. Here Viśvāmitra imparted to
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, who felt too weak on account
<div n="lb"/>of hunger and thirst the two mantras Balā and Atibalā,
<div n="lb"/>which would ward off hunger and thirst. He also
<div n="lb"/>taught them the use of certain rare arrows. Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>was specially taught the use of a divine arrow called
<div n="lb"/>Jṛmbhakāstra.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Tāṭakā killed.%} While Viśvāmitra was relating to
<div n="lb"/>them the story of Tāṭakā, who dwelt in the forest, they
<div n="lb"/>saw the fierce Rākṣasī coming fast with a long spear in
<div n="lb"/>her hand. She threw a big rock at Viśvāmitra. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>shattered the rock with an arrow. Next, Tāṭakā dashed
<div n="lb"/>forward against Rāma roaring furiously, and Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>with another arrow killed her. The soul of the dead
<div n="lb"/>Tāṭakā assumed the form of a Gandharva woman and
<div n="lb"/>ascended to heaven.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Salvation to Ahalyā.%} Rākṣasas like Subāhu lined up
<div n="lb"/>to obstruct the yajña, which Viśvāmitra began after
<div n="lb"/>the killing of Tāṭakā. Rāma killed Subāhu; Mārīca ran
<div n="lb"/>away in fright and hid himself in the sea. Rāma drove
<div n="lb"/>away the other Rākṣasas.
<div n="NI"/>Next, Viśvāmitra, hearing about the Svayaṃvara of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, daughter of King Janaka started for his palace with
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and on the way he told the boys
<div n="lb"/>many Purāṇic stories. They bathed in the river Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>and a short walk took them to the vacant āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Gautama. The great muni called Gautama had once
<div n="lb"/>lived in this āśrama with his dutiful wife Ahalyā and
<div n="lb"/>their son Śatānanda, an erudite scholar in all sciences.
<div n="lb"/>Indra, who lost his head over the great beauty of Ahalyā
<div n="lb"/>went to the āśrama one midnight in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>cock and crew. Thinking it was already dawn Gautama
<div n="lb"/>went to the river for bath when Indra assumed the
<div n="lb"/>form of the muni, entered his bed room and slept with
<div n="lb"/>Ahalyā. When Gautama understood the fraud thus
<div n="lb"/>played upon him, he cursed her into a stone. She was
<div n="lb"/>to resume her old form when, during Tretāyuga, Śrī
[Page632-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Rāma trod upon the stone. Accordingly, as soon as
<div n="lb"/>Rāma trod on the stone Ahalyā cast off her form as stone
<div n="lb"/>and resumed her old form as Ahalyā. Immediately
<div n="lb"/>Gautama and Śatānanda also appeared on the scene.
<div n="lb"/>Ahalyā ascended to the sky as a devī.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Marriage.%} Vlśvāmitra came to king Janaka's palace
<div n="lb"/>with Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. Janaka's daughter Sītā and
<div n="lb"/>his younger brothers' daughters Māṇḍavī, Ūrmilā and
<div n="lb"/>Śrutakīrti were living in the palace as sisters and very
<div n="lb"/>good friends. One day the princesses who were playing
<div n="lb"/>in the garden could not pluck jasmine flowers from a
<div n="lb"/>height. Sītā then brought the Śaivacāpa (Śiva's bow)
<div n="lb"/>from the weapon-room and shot down Jasmine flowers
<div n="lb"/>with it. As Janaka watched Sītā's action of shooting
<div n="lb"/>with the Śaivacāpa an idea came into his head. He
<div n="lb"/>announced that the hero, who succeeded in shoot-
<div n="lb"/>ing with Śaivacāpa, would be given Sītā in marriage.
<div n="NI"/>Just as Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were inseparable compan-
<div n="lb"/>ions Sītā and Ūrmilā were always to be found together
<div n="lb"/>and Māṇḍavī and Śrutakīrti were particular friends.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma shot an arrow from Śiva's bow and he was
<div n="lb"/>selected as Sītā's husband. Janaka informed Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>of the marriage and he came with his attendants.
<div n="lb"/>Bharata married Māṇḍavī, Lakṣmaṇa, Ūrmilā and
<div n="lb"/>Śatrughna, Śrutakīrti. After living in Mithilā for some-
<div n="lb"/>time Daśaratha and others returned to Ayodhyā. Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra went to the Himālayas for rest.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Paraśurāma's threat.%} Daśaratha and others on their
<div n="lb"/>way back to Ayodhyā passed the Videha kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>reached the suburbs of Bhārgavāśrama. All of a sudden
<div n="lb"/>a shining form of a brahmin with Kṣatriya effulgence
<div n="lb"/>appeared in front of the procession. Vasiṣṭha under-
<div n="lb"/>stood that it was Paraśurāma and Daśaratha and
<div n="lb"/>others were alarmed. Paraśurāma approached Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>who was viewing the former with quiet serenity. Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma was very angry that Rāma broke the bow of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>who was his (Paraśurāma's) preceptor. All Rāma's con-
<div n="lb"/>ciliatory talk failed to pacify Paraśurāma, who spoke
<div n="lb"/>thus to Rāma: “You, impudent fellow! you insulted
<div n="lb"/>me and my preceptor. All right, let me see your power.
<div n="lb"/>Take this my bow, and shoot with it.”
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma took hold of the bow and bent it easily and
<div n="lb"/>fixing an arrow on it asked Paraśurāma to point out the
<div n="lb"/>target for it. As Paraśurāma feared that if the arrow
<div n="lb"/>was sent, it might crush the whole universe, he asked
<div n="lb"/>Rāma so choose the result of his (Paraśurāma's) tapas
<div n="lb"/>as target for the arrow. Both the bow and the arrow
<div n="lb"/>were of Viṣṇu's power. That power as well as his own
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇava power, Paraśurāma transferred to Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and having thus fulfilled the object of his incarnation
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma went to Puṇyāśrama for permanent tapas.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Ruin of the country.%} Daśaratha decided to install Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma as crown prince. The people whole-heartedly
<div n="lb"/>welcomed it. During the night previous to the corona-
<div n="lb"/>tion, while the wives of Daśaratha were gladly discussing
<div n="lb"/>the happy incident, Mantharā, the tale-bearing maid of
<div n="lb"/>Kaikeyī advised her mistress to prevail upon Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>to exile Rāma into the forest and install Bharata as
<div n="lb"/>crown prince. Mantharā also reminded Kaikeyī about
<div n="lb"/>the boons, which had been promised to her by Daśaratha
<div n="lb"/>during the devāsura war. Kaikeyī fell into the trap
<div n="lb"/>thus set by Mantharā. Kaikeyī put on a wrathful face and
<div n="lb"/>shut herself up in a room. When Daśaratha enquired
<div n="lb"/>of her the reason for her anger she asked him to make
<div n="lb"/>her son Bharata, the crown prince and exile Rāma for
[Page633-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>fourteen years' life in forest. The king fainted when
<div n="lb"/>he heard the demand But, Śrī Rāma, on hearing about
<div n="lb"/>it, put on an anchorite's apparel and got ready to start
<div n="lb"/>for the forest. Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa also got ready to
<div n="lb"/>follow Rāma into the forest. While the entire popula-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Ayodhyā stood there weeping, Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Sītā wearing the forest-dwellers' garb started for the
<div n="lb"/>forest.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Death of Daśaratha and Bharata's decision.%} As soon
<div n="lb"/>as Sumantra, who had accompanied Rāma and others
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ayodhyā, Daśaratha expired on account
<div n="lb"/>of unbearable grief caused by Rāma's exile. Messengers
<div n="lb"/>brought to Ayodhyā Bharata and Śatrughna from Kekaya
<div n="lb"/>where they were put up with their uncle Yudhājit at
<div n="lb"/>the time of their father's death. But, they were kept in
<div n="lb"/>the dark of all that had happened in their absence till
<div n="lb"/>their arrival at the palace. Bharata, who heard of every-
<div n="lb"/>thing from his mother was greatly upset and got ready
<div n="lb"/>to go to Rāma in the forest. Śatrughna too got ready
<div n="lb"/>to accompany him. Arundhatī and Vasiṣṭha in a chariot
<div n="lb"/>in the fore-front, Kausalyā and Sumitrā in another
<div n="lb"/>chariot just behind the first one, Bharata and Śatrughna
<div n="lb"/>behind them—in this manner the great journey into the
<div n="lb"/>forest started. Leaving all others behind him, Bharata
<div n="lb"/>went forward and prostrated before Rāma and Lakṣ-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa at Citrakūṭa. Śrī Rāma broke into tears on hear-
<div n="lb"/>ing about the death of their father. But in spite of
<div n="lb"/>Bharata's pressing request Rāma refused to return to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā. At last Bharata yielded to Rāma's injunction
<div n="lb"/>and returned to Ayodhyā with the latter's sandals. But
<div n="lb"/>he did not enter the palace; instead he built an āśrama
<div n="lb"/>at Nandigrāma and worshipping Rāma's sandals lived
<div n="lb"/>there.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Trip to Pañcavaṭī.%} From Mount Citrakūṭa Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and others started towards the forest. When they
<div n="lb"/>continued their journey after visiting the Sage Atri's
<div n="lb"/>āśrama a Rākṣasa called Virādha ran away carrying
<div n="lb"/>off Sītā. Rāma killed Virādha and regained Sītā. Then
<div n="lb"/>they visited the āśrama of sage Śarabhaṅga in the
<div n="lb"/>Kumuda forest. Therefrom they went to the Mṛkaṇḍu
<div n="lb"/>forest where they visited maharṣi Agastya, and there
<div n="lb"/>Rāma took the vow to kill Rāvaṇa and other evil Rā-
<div n="lb"/>kṣasas and thus render the land safe for sages to perform
<div n="lb"/>tapas. Agastya presented to Rāma a Vaiṣṇava bow, a
<div n="lb"/>Brāhma arrow and a Śaiva quiver. Rāma kept them
<div n="lb"/>with Agastya himself to be given to him when required.
<div n="lb"/>Then Agastya gave Rāma a divine ornament such as
<div n="lb"/>was not available in all the three worlds. Rāma tied it
<div n="lb"/>round Sītā's neck. Taking leave of Agastya, Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>others went to the Daṇḍaka forest. It was on a high peak
<div n="lb"/>of Mount Mahākrauñca in the forest that Jaṭāyu,
<div n="lb"/>brother of Sampāti and a very close friend of Rāma
<div n="lb"/>lived. Rāma and Jaṭāyu renewed their old friendship and
<div n="lb"/>decided to be of mutual service in future. After that
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and others rested themselves on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the near-by Godāvarī.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Stay at Pañcavaṭī.%} Pañcavaṭī was on the southern
<div n="lb"/>bank of the Godāvarī. Five vaṭas (peepal trees) of the
<div n="lb"/>same size stood there in a circle, and so the place was
<div n="lb"/>called Pañcavaṭī. (See under Pañcavaṭī). Śrī Rāma de-
<div n="lb"/>cided to build his āśrama at the centre of those trees.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa cut down an ebony tree there to put up a
<div n="lb"/>parṇaśālā (hut) At once the log disappeared and the
<div n="lb"/>dead body of a Rākṣasa youth was found there. It was
<div n="lb"/>the corpse of Śambhukumāra, son of Śūrpaṇakhā. He
[Page633-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was performing tapas there to propitiate Śiva when he
<div n="lb"/>was overcome by the beauty of Sītā and to look at her
<div n="lb"/>from a hidden spot he had assumed the form of the
<div n="lb"/>ebony tree. It was him that Lakṣmaṇa had cut down.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma understood the situation and explained to his
<div n="lb"/>wife and brother about the trickeries of the Rākṣasas.
<div n="lb"/>Then the parṇaśālā was constructed and they lived
<div n="lb"/>there. Hearing about the coming of Rāma all the sages
<div n="lb"/>of the Daṇḍaka forest visited them. They lived in
<div n="lb"/>Pañcavaṭī for thirteen years.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Test by Parameśvara (Śiva) and Pārvatī.%} Parameś-
<div n="lb"/>vara and Pārvatī, who knew that many tricky changes
<div n="lb"/>would occur in the thirteenth year of the life of Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Sītā there, decided to submit them to a test. The
<div n="lb"/>object of the test was to see whether Rāma and Sītā
<div n="lb"/>would recognise each other under all circumstances.
<div n="lb"/>When Sītā one day entered the river Godāvarī to
<div n="lb"/>fetch water, she saw two swans enjoying themselves in
<div n="lb"/>a lotus pool in the middle of a sand-shoal in the river.
<div n="lb"/>When Sītā went near the pool she saw Rāma bathing
<div n="lb"/>in it. But on a closer look she recognised that it was
<div n="lb"/>not Rāma, but Śiva, in the guise of Rāma, who was
<div n="lb"/>bathing there. To befool Sītā Śiva, who was disguised
<div n="lb"/>as Rāma, told her:—Dear one! Please come to me
<div n="lb"/>quickly. Why were you so late?
<div n="NI"/>Sītā:—Oh, Deva! salutations. Why did you alone
<div n="lb"/>come to the bath?
<div n="NI"/>Rāma:—I had to come alone as Devī did not come
<div n="lb"/>with me at once and was late in coming.
<div n="NI"/>Sītā:—Why did not the Devī come? You two are
<div n="lb"/>unique. Devī might be alone at Kailāsa just now. It
<div n="lb"/>was not good that you did not bring her also with you.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva: Oh great Devī! salutations to your divine
<div n="lb"/>greatness. Let me return to Kailāsa after saluting Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. Hail unto thee.
<div n="NI"/>Meanwhile Śrī Rāma was waiting impatiently for Sītā to
<div n="lb"/>return. Then Sītā approached him looking into a lotus
<div n="lb"/>flower she held in her hand and also throwing, off and
<div n="lb"/>on, amorous glances at him. (She was in fact Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>in the guise of Sītā). And she told Rāma:—My Lord!
<div n="lb"/>you would excuse my delay in returning. The delay was
<div n="lb"/>due to my tarrying there to look at the play of two swans.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma looked closely and recognised that it was not
<div n="lb"/>Sītā and replied as follows:—Oh Devī! my salutations.
<div n="lb"/>Did you come alone? Where is Deva? How is it that
<div n="lb"/>you are separated from him? Mahādeva and Mahādevī
<div n="lb"/>are one and inseparable. Then how this separation?
<div n="lb"/>Sītā (Pārvatī):—Salutations. Thou art omniscient and
<div n="lb"/>omnipotent. I return to the presence of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>15) {%The incident of Śūrpaṇakhā.%} Śūrpaṇakhā was the
<div n="lb"/>wife of a Rākṣasa called Vidyujjihva. Once in a war
<div n="lb"/>which Rāvaṇa, Vidyujjihva and other Rākṣasas fought
<div n="lb"/>at Devaloka Vidyujjihva was killed by mistake. Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, permitted Śūrpaṇakhā to choose whomsoever
<div n="lb"/>she liked as her husband, and she went about the
<div n="lb"/>world in search of a suitable husband. She liked some
<div n="lb"/>persons, but they did not like her, and vice versa. Thus
<div n="lb"/>she was roaming about discontented. She was also on
<div n="lb"/>the look-out for an opportunity to take vengeance on
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa for killing her son, Śambhukumāra.
<div n="NI"/>Śūrpaṇakhā, who heard about the beauty of Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa came to Pañcavaṭī disguised as Lalitā. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma alone was there in the āśrama at the time and
<div n="lb"/>she told him that she was love-sick. Śrī Rāma rejected
<div n="lb"/>her prayer on the plea that he was already married.
[Page634-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Then she approached Lakṣmaṇa with the same request.
<div n="lb"/>He too refused to oblige her. Then she saw Sītā there
<div n="lb"/>and decided to shatter her married life and also to make
<div n="lb"/>a present of her to Rāvaṇa. She also thought that if
<div n="lb"/>Sītā were got rid of she would have Rāma for husband.
<div n="lb"/>Maddened by such thoughts she rushed into the āśrama.
<div n="lb"/>But, Lakṣmaṇa drove her out. Then, carrying
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa with her she rose into the sky and he cut away
<div n="lb"/>both her ears, breasts and nose. Thus disfigured she
<div n="lb"/>resumed her form of Rākṣasī. She flew away in the sky
<div n="lb"/>roaring loudly.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Khara killed.%} Having heard about the disfigure-
<div n="lb"/>ment of Śūrpaṇakhā Khara sent fourteen Rākṣasas to
<div n="lb"/>Rāma's āśrama. Lakṣmaṇa killed them very easily.
<div n="lb"/>Next, Khara, his brothers Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras with
<div n="lb"/>fourteen thousand Rākṣasa soldiers came to fight Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa killed them also. This saddened
<div n="lb"/>Śūrpaṇakhā very much and she reported the entire
<div n="lb"/>affair to Rāvaṇa at Laṅkā. She told him that Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa were very courageous warriors and he was
<div n="lb"/>not to enter into direct fighting with them, but was to
<div n="lb"/>abduct Sītā whose loss would cause Rāma's death. She
<div n="lb"/>also assured Rāvaṇa that if Rāma died, Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>would himself end his life.
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Sītā abducted.%} Next day a spotted deer was found
<div n="lb"/>playing near the āśrama. Sītā desired to have the deer
<div n="lb"/>and Śrī Rāma, after asking his brother to take care of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, followed the deer, which enticed him to a great
<div n="lb"/>distance in the forest. At last, finding it difficult to
<div n="lb"/>catch the deer alive, Rāma shot an arrow at it. Hit by
<div n="lb"/>the arrow the deer transformed itself into a gigantic
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa and fell down dead crying. “Oh! Sītā O!
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa, a Rākṣasa is killing me. Come and save
<div n="lb"/>me.”
<div n="NI"/>The Rākṣasa, who thus fell a prey to Rāma's arrow was
<div n="lb"/>really Mārīca, uncle of Rāvaṇa. Mārīca had
<div n="lb"/>gone in the form of a deer to Rāma's āśrama at the
<div n="lb"/>instance of his nephew to cheat Rāma. Sītā heard the
<div n="lb"/>false cry of Mārīca and asked Lakṣmaṇa to hurry up
<div n="lb"/>to the spot for Rāma's protection. Lakṣmaṇa at first
<div n="lb"/>did not want to leave Sītā there alone and go after
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. But, when she used hard and cruel words
<div n="lb"/>against him Lakṣmaṇa quitted the āśrama and went
<div n="lb"/>into the forest. When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were thus
<div n="lb"/>absent at the āśrama an old Sannyāsin came for alms
<div n="lb"/>at the courtyard. Sītā, who came out to offer alms
<div n="lb"/>was forcibly carried away by Rāvaṇa (the sannyāsin
<div n="lb"/>was Rāvaṇa in disguise) in his puṣpaka aerial chariot
<div n="lb"/>to Laṅkā. On the way Jaṭāyu saw Rāvaṇa and put
<div n="lb"/>up a fight with him to get Sītā released. But, Jaṭāyu
<div n="lb"/>had to fall down wounded by the sword of Rāvaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>he lay there awaiting Rāma's arrival.
<div n="NI"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa returned to the āśrama only to
<div n="lb"/>find Sītā missing. While they advanced some distance
<div n="lb"/>lamenting over the loss of Sītā they saw Jaṭāyu lying
<div n="lb"/>in the forest, his wings cut, but happy in expectation
<div n="lb"/>of salvation and repeating the name of Rāma. Jaṭāyu
<div n="lb"/>gave Rāma all details about Sītā and then gave up his
<div n="lb"/>body and ascended to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Salvation to Kabandha.%} Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa moved
<div n="lb"/>towards the south in quest of Sītā. An asura woman
<div n="lb"/>called Ayomukhī, sister of Śūrapadma tried to entice
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa, who went alone to a pool to fetch water.
<div n="lb"/>When Lakṣmaṇa resisted and kept away from her
<div n="lb"/>allurements, she tried to carry him away into the sky.
[Page634-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>But, he drove her away disfigured. When the brothers
<div n="lb"/>continued their search for Sītā they were caught in the
<div n="lb"/>arms stretched out in semi-circular form. It was a
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa called Kabandha, and they cut away one arm
<div n="lb"/>each. At once the fierce Kabandha (headless body)
<div n="lb"/>form disappeared and a Gandharva youth appeared in
<div n="lb"/>his place. After offering mokṣa to Kabandha Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa continued their search for Sītā. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Kabandha).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Salvation to Śabarī.%} Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa reached
<div n="lb"/>Śabaryāśrama and were duly received by the female
<div n="lb"/>hermit Śabarī. She presented them with fruits. Not
<div n="lb"/>only that, she personally tasted each fruit for its quality
<div n="lb"/>and then gave the best to the guests. Rāma was so very
<div n="lb"/>pleased with her pure devotion that he offered her
<div n="lb"/>salvation. (For details see under Śabarī).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%Rāma-Sugriva alliance.%} Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>bathed in the Pampā river and thus refreshed they
<div n="lb"/>travelled upto the height of Mount Ṛṣyamūka where
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva lived with Hanūmān as his Prime Minister.
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva, who saw Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa coming, deputed
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān to find out whether they were friends or
<div n="lb"/>foes. Hanūmān, in the guise of a brahmin boy talked
<div n="lb"/>with them, who related their story from the abduction
<div n="lb"/>of Sītā. Having understood the matters Hanūmān re-
<div n="lb"/>sumed his actual form and carried Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>on his shoulders into the presence of Sugrīva.
<div n="NI"/>Sugrīva related to Rāma the story of his expulsion
<div n="lb"/>from Kiṣkindhā by Bāli, his elder brother. Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>wanted a powerful ally to recapture the country. Simi-
<div n="lb"/>larly Śrī Rāma too wanted a powerful ally to regain
<div n="lb"/>Sītā. So both the parties entered into an alliance,
<div n="lb"/>Rāma undertaking to kill Bāli and restore his kingdom
<div n="lb"/>and his wife to Sugrīva and Sugrīva undertaking to
<div n="lb"/>search for and find out Sītā for Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Though the above pact was made, Sugrīva was doubt-
<div n="lb"/>ful about Rāma's capacity to honour his part of the
<div n="lb"/>contract, and Rāma, knowing this suspicion of Sugrīva,
<div n="lb"/>wanted to dispel it. The mountain-like body of Dun-
<div n="lb"/>dubhi, the Rākṣasa killed by Bāli, lay there in a big
<div n="lb"/>heap of bones and at the instance of Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>threw it into the distant southern sea with the big toe
<div n="lb"/>of his left foot. Sugrīva was wonder-struck at this feat
<div n="lb"/>of Lakṣmaṇa and praised him. Yet Sugrīva was not
<div n="lb"/>quite cured of his doubt and Rāma wanted to further
<div n="lb"/>convince him of their prowess.
<div n="NI"/>There were seven big trees there known as Saptasālas.
<div n="lb"/>Bāli used to wrestle with the trees due to his overflowing
<div n="lb"/>vitality and power. (See under Saptasāla). Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>went near the trees and suddenly fixed an arrow on his
<div n="lb"/>bow-string and shot it by drawing the bow, with the
<div n="lb"/>big toe of his right foot pressed against a rock. The
<div n="lb"/>arrow cut down the seven trees at one and the same
<div n="lb"/>time and then automatically returned to its quiver.
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva was taken aback by this marvellous show of
<div n="lb"/>power.
<div n="NI"/>21) {%Exhibition of ornaments.%} They came again to
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣyamūkācala and Sugrīva placed before Rāma a
<div n="lb"/>bundle of ornaments and said that it was dropped down
<div n="lb"/>by a weeping woman from an aerial chariot, which had,
<div n="lb"/>a few days back, passed above the mountain. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>recognised them as Sītā's ornaments, shed tears and sat
<div n="lb"/>there motionless for some time. At last Sugrīva and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa consoled him and he handed over the bundle
<div n="lb"/>of ornaments to Lakṣmaṇa.
[Page635-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Kingdom restored to Sugrīva.%} The very next day
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva took Rāma to Kiṣkindhā, and the former
<div n="lb"/>challenged Bāli for a combat. Rāma, from a distance,
<div n="lb"/>viewed the fierce fight between the brothers, but he
<div n="lb"/>could not do anything as it was impossible to distinguish
<div n="lb"/>between Bāli and Sugrīva on account of their very
<div n="lb"/>close resemblance. Sugrīva, who was defeated in the
<div n="lb"/>first round and retired from fight felt angry towards
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, but was soon satisfied with Rāma's explanation
<div n="lb"/>for his inaction. To distinguish Sugrīva from Bāli Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rama, the next day, put a garland on the former's neck
<div n="lb"/>and wearing the garland Sugriva challenged Bāli a
<div n="lb"/>second time to a duel. Though Bāli's wife, Tārā,
<div n="lb"/>this time prevented him from accepting the challenge
<div n="lb"/>Bāli paid no heed to her protests and rushed forth for
<div n="lb"/>the duel.
<div n="NI"/>Bāli and Sugrīva fought again, and this time Rāma
<div n="lb"/>from his concealment behind a tree shot an arrow at
<div n="lb"/>the chest of Bāli. The arrow felled him. Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa then came into the open and Bāli spoke
<div n="lb"/>disparagingly to Rāma about shooting the arrow from
<div n="lb"/>concealment. Rāma answered him saying that if he
<div n="lb"/>had seen him (Rāma) face to face he would have
<div n="lb"/>become his devotee and he had to shoot Bāli from his
<div n="lb"/>hiding place as it was not proper to kill one's devotees.
<div n="lb"/>At last, after handing over charge of his wife and son
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgada, to Sugrīva, Bāli breathed his last. Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>decided to crown Sugrīva as King and install Aṅgada
<div n="lb"/>as crown prince and returned to Ṛṣyamūkācala for
<div n="lb"/>rest after entrusting, under the supervision of Lakṣmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān and Jāmbavān with the duty of making
<div n="lb"/>preparations for the coronation. Though Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>invited Śrī Rāma to Kiṣkindhā when preparations for
<div n="lb"/>coronation were over, the latter declined the invitation
<div n="lb"/>gracefully and deputed Lakṣmaṇa to represent him at
<div n="lb"/>the ceremony. Lakṣmaṇa installed Sugrīva as the
<div n="lb"/>Mahārāja, Aṅgada as crown prince, Rumā as queen
<div n="lb"/>and Tārā as queen-mother. Also, Hanūmān was
<div n="lb"/>appointed as Sugrīva's minister. Those things over,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa returned to Rāma at Ṛṣyamūkācala.
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Lakṣmaṇa's wrath.%} The next four months were
<div n="lb"/>rainy period. Even after that Sugrīva did not make
<div n="lb"/>necessary arrangements to search for Sītā. At Rāma's
<div n="lb"/>instance Lakṣmaṇa went to Kiṣkindhā to enquire about
<div n="lb"/>the reason for the delay. The monkeys were alarmed
<div n="lb"/>by the grave appearance of Lakṣmaṇa and Tārā came
<div n="lb"/>out and apologised to him. Arrangements were soon
<div n="lb"/>finalised for the quest of Sītā. Armies of many lakhs
<div n="lb"/>of monkeys were deputed to the eight regions to search
<div n="lb"/>for Sītā. Suṣeṇa was appointed chief of the army for
<div n="lb"/>the west, Śatabali for the north, Vinata for the east and
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgada for the south. As the south was the chief
<div n="lb"/>place for the search, monkeys like Hanūmān, Jāmbavān,
<div n="lb"/>Vivida, Nala, Nila, Kumuda, each of them an expert
<div n="lb"/>in various ways, were appointed chiefs of different
<div n="lb"/>matters. Every chief and his assistant was given
<div n="lb"/>suitable instructions by Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva, and
<div n="lb"/>accordingly the army of monkeys began its march
<div n="lb"/>under the leadership of Hanūmān.
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Words of recognition.%} To convince Sītā that it was
<div n="lb"/>really the emissary of Rāma who went to her the latter
<div n="lb"/>imparted to Hanūmān the following three sentences for
<div n="lb"/>timely use.
<div n="NI"/>(i) “When I took leave of you for life in exile in the
<div n="lb"/>forest you (Sītā) who were then in the inner apartment
[Page635-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>dressed in ordinary fashion came out in the same dress
<div n="lb"/>prepared to follow me saying ‘I too...’ feigning anger’.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) When, for out life in the forest, we had left the
<div n="lb"/>city and approached a shrubbery, Śītā in her childish
<div n="lb"/>ignorance and goodness of heart told me “This place
<div n="lb"/>will do for our forest life.”
<div n="NI"/>(iii) While she was one day massaging my leg in our
<div n="lb"/>bedroom she threw away from her finger the ring
<div n="lb"/>studded with stones. When I asked her the reason for
<div n="lb"/>it she answered me as follows:—This ring studded with
<div n="lb"/>stones may prove to be of danger to me. When your
<div n="lb"/>feet touched the hard granite rock it turned out into a
<div n="lb"/>world beauty (Ahalyā). Under the circumstances how
<div n="lb"/>much more beautiful would be the woman, who would
<div n="lb"/>be created by the touch of your foot on the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>stone of the ring? And, because of that beauty you
<div n="lb"/>may...me...and then...”. We two—I and Sītā—alone
<div n="lb"/>knew about the above incident.
<div n="NI"/>Carrying thus Śrī Rāma's signet ring and words of re-
<div n="lb"/>cognition Hanūmān went along with the army, which
<div n="lb"/>started for the south. Sugrīva gave one month's time
<div n="lb"/>to the searching parties to find out Sītā and warned
<div n="lb"/>them that their throats would be cut if they failed in
<div n="lb"/>their mission.
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Saw Svayamprabhā.%} Aṅgada, Hanūmān, Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>and others during their search came to an extensive
<div n="lb"/>forest. They were dead tired with hunger and thirst.
<div n="lb"/>The leader of the party looked about for something to
<div n="lb"/>eat and drink when he saw small birds flying up from
<div n="lb"/>a distant pit. From drops of water falling from the
<div n="lb"/>wings of the birds it was inferred that the pit contained
<div n="lb"/>water. When Hanūmān and others entered the pit
<div n="lb"/>(cave) and walked a great distance they came to a
<div n="lb"/>spacious garden. They were astonished to find a solitary
<div n="lb"/>beauty there, and she related to them her autobiography
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>I am the faithful maid of Rambhā. The powerful asura
<div n="lb"/>called Caturāsya wanted me to procure Rambhā for
<div n="lb"/>him and he got this garden city built by Mayācārya,
<div n="lb"/>the architect of the Daityas, for me as reward for my
<div n="lb"/>service to him in the matter of Rambhā. Various kinds
<div n="lb"/>of gems light this place and creepers and trees supply
<div n="lb"/>food materials. Catuārsya, I and Rambhā alone were
<div n="lb"/>living here. But, Indra came to know of it, came here,
<div n="lb"/>killed Caturāsya and took away Rambhā with him.
<div n="lb"/>He cursed me to lead a solitary life here as punish-
<div n="lb"/>ment for having helped Caturāsya. I prayed for redemp-
<div n="lb"/>tion from the curse and Indra told me, that after
<div n="lb"/>thousands of years a company of monkeys would come
<div n="lb"/>here in search of Sītā and that after entertaining them
<div n="lb"/>with food I must see Rāma and then return to Svarga.
<div n="lb"/>I have thus been awaiting your arrival and now I am
<div n="lb"/>leaving the place, which will vanish as soon as I quit
<div n="lb"/>it. All of you, please stand there with eyes closed and
<div n="lb"/>I shall send you back to the place where you were
<div n="lb"/>before coming here.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly the monkeys stood there with eyes closed
<div n="lb"/>and when they opened their eyes there was neither the
<div n="lb"/>garden city nor Svayamprabhā there but they were
<div n="lb"/>standing in the old plain. Svayamprabhā appeared
<div n="lb"/>before Rāma, praised him and then went to Svarga.
<div n="NI"/>26) {%Met Sampāti.%} The monkeys again went southward,
<div n="lb"/>reached Mahendragiri and descending on its southern
<div n="lb"/>side came to the shores of the southern sea. They could
<div n="lb"/>advance no further to the south. They were suffering
[Page636-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>from great hunger and thirst and if they returned with
<div n="lb"/>no tangible information about Sītā, Sugrīva would kill
<div n="lb"/>them. They preferred death by fasting on the seashore
<div n="lb"/>to death by the sword of Sugrīva.
<div n="NI"/>Having decided thus the monkeys spread darbha grass
<div n="lb"/>on the extensive plain of Mahendra mountain and lay
<div n="lb"/>on the grass to die. In a large cave in the mountain
<div n="lb"/>was living Sampāti. The huge bird Sampāti was star-
<div n="lb"/>ving without food and was not able to fly as it had lost
<div n="lb"/>its wings. But it dragged itself to the mouth of the cave
<div n="lb"/>and saw the monkeys lying there awaiting death, and
<div n="lb"/>it thought of eating the monkeys one by one. The
<div n="lb"/>monkeys, who understood this idea of Sampāti cursed
<div n="lb"/>their fate and sang the praise of Jaṭāyu.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the word ‘Jaṭāyu’ Sampāti approached the
<div n="lb"/>monkeys, who related to him the object of their journey.
<div n="lb"/>Being told about the death of Jaṭāyu. Sampāti
<div n="lb"/>shed tears and told the monkeys as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>Jaṭāyu was my younger brother. Our mother was Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>śvetā and father Sūryadeva. On account of the boon of
<div n="lb"/>our parents I was King of all the birds and Jaṭāyu the
<div n="lb"/>crown Prince. As our brotherliness grew thicker our
<div n="lb"/>haughtiness due to our power and speed also increased.
<div n="lb"/>Once we flew up towards the orbit of the Sun to see him,
<div n="lb"/>our father. In his youthful enthusiasm my younger
<div n="lb"/>brother, Jaṭāyu, climbed higher up in the sky leaving
<div n="lb"/>me behind. Due to the heat of the Sun his wings lost
<div n="lb"/>their power and energy. Then, to save him, I flew up
<div n="lb"/>above him and shaded him. Therefore he could descend
<div n="lb"/>to the earth without his wings being burned and thus
<div n="lb"/>killed. But, my wings got burned and I fell down on
<div n="lb"/>the Mahendra mountain and got my legs broken. Thus
<div n="lb"/>I lost the power either to fly or to walk.
<div n="NI"/>I stayed here as the attendant of Niśākara Maharṣi,
<div n="lb"/>who could divine the future also. He told me the story
<div n="lb"/>about Rāma's incarnation. He told me further that
<div n="lb"/>monkeys in search of Sītā would come here when I
<div n="lb"/>should tell them where Sītā was and that then I would
<div n="lb"/>regain my health.”
<div n="NI"/>After telling the monkeys the above facts Sampāti, with
<div n="lb"/>their cooperation, performed the obsequies of Jaṭāyu.
<div n="lb"/>Then the King of birds (Sampāti) raised its head and
<div n="lb"/>surveyed the ocean and he saw the following: Mountain
<div n="lb"/>Subela in the heart of the southern sea; the plain at
<div n="lb"/>the heights of the mountain constituting the base of
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā; in the centre of Laṅkā there was Rāvaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>capital; nearby the ladies' quarters; near the quarters
<div n="lb"/>the aśoka garden; at the centre of the garden the
<div n="lb"/>śiṃśapā tree and under the tree Sītādevī.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as Sampāti had finished telling the monkeys
<div n="lb"/>the above details he regained his health.
<div n="NI"/>Sampāti told the monkeys another story also as follows:-
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa once abducted a Yakṣa beauty from Alakāpurī
<div n="lb"/>and carried her away in his Puṣpaka Vimāna.
<div n="lb"/>Sampāti clashed with Rāvaṇa on his way and destroyed
<div n="lb"/>his plane. But the plane, which was self-generating
<div n="lb"/>came again into existence. Sampāti threw away by
<div n="lb"/>its beak the Candrahāsa (Rāvaṇa's sword) and kicked
<div n="lb"/>his crown down. At last, at the request of Rāvaṇa, he
<div n="lb"/>and Sampāti signed a non-aggression pact. That was
<div n="lb"/>the reason why Sampāti could not fight Rāvaṇa in
<div n="lb"/>person.
<div n="NI"/>27) {%Hanūmān saw Sītā.%} Aṅgada said that for the search
<div n="lb"/>for Sītā in Laṅkā as told by Sampāti, some one should
<div n="lb"/>jump across the ocean. Though many a monkey tried to
[Page636-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>do so it was Hanūmān, who succeeded in crossing the sea.
<div n="lb"/>At one jump he reached the heights of Mahendragiri
<div n="lb"/>whence he took another jump forward. But, midway
<div n="lb"/>Surasā, mother of the nāgas, swallowed him, and he
<div n="lb"/>came out through her ear and continued his journey
<div n="lb"/>towards Laṅkā. When he had advanced some more
<div n="lb"/>distance an evil spirit called Chāyāgrāhiṇī obstructed
<div n="lb"/>his way by a mysterious attack on his shadow.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān quickly understood what had happened and
<div n="lb"/>killed the evil spirit with one kick of his left foot. He
<div n="lb"/>again continued his flight. But, he very soon became
<div n="lb"/>weak and exhausted. Then Mount Maināka emerged
<div n="lb"/>from the ocean and fed Hanūmān with fruits and roots.
<div n="lb"/>He reached Laṅkā at dusk. He defeated Laṅkālakṣmī,
<div n="lb"/>who tried to prevent his entry into the city. In fact
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkālakṣmī was Vijayalakṣmī, who had been cursed
<div n="lb"/>by Brahmā. (For details see under Vijayalakṣmī).
<div n="lb"/>After defeating her, who was thus absolved from the
<div n="lb"/>curse, Hanūmān saw Sītā seated under the aśoka tree.
<div n="lb"/>But, none saw him as he was perched on a tree.
<div n="NI"/>28) {%Hanūmān's return.%} That night Rāvaṇa dressed in
<div n="lb"/>all splendour visited Sītā and tried to secure her favour
<div n="lb"/>by soft words and cajolery, all to no purpose. Then he
<div n="lb"/>threatened her with punishments, which too proved
<div n="lb"/>to be of no avail. After instructing the Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>women that Sītā should be somehow brought round
<div n="lb"/>within a month's time, Rāvaṇa returned to his palace.
<div n="NI"/>Rākṣasīs surrounded Sītā and described to her the
<div n="lb"/>greatness and various merits of Rāvaṇa. Sītā continued
<div n="lb"/>to sob. Then came there Trijaṭā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa, the great devotee of Viṣṇu, and Saramā,
<div n="lb"/>to console Sītā. Trijaṭā had boundless devotion to-
<div n="lb"/>wards Rāma and great love for Sītā. She repeated
<div n="lb"/>to Sītā certain dreams she had had.
<div n="NI"/>Left to herself Sītā began saying to herself various
<div n="lb"/>things regarding her past. She referred to her infancy,
<div n="lb"/>beginning of youth, wedding, stay at Ayodhyā, forest-
<div n="lb"/>life and life in Pañcavaṭī and wept over her recurring
<div n="lb"/>thoughts about them. Hanūmān, who heard Sītā's
<div n="lb"/>soliloquy completed Sītā's story by relating, from his
<div n="lb"/>place on the tree, about Jaṭāyu's salvation, salvation
<div n="lb"/>given to Kabandha and Śabarī, alliance with Sugrīva,
<div n="lb"/>killing of Bāli, expedition of the monkeys in search of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, meeting with Sampāti, himself (Hanūmān) cross-
<div n="lb"/>ing the sea and his finding out Sītā. Hearing the words
<div n="lb"/>of Hanūmān, Sītā looked up in astonishment. Immedia-
<div n="lb"/>tely Hanūmān came down the tree and presented the
<div n="lb"/>signet ring at Sītā's feet. When she examined the ring
<div n="lb"/>her hands shook and tears dimmed her eyes. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>talked to her in detail and told her that he would, if
<div n="lb"/>only Sītā permitted him, carry her on his shoulders to
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. He told her further that if she did not welcome
<div n="lb"/>the idea of thus returning to Rāma, he would return
<div n="lb"/>with Śrī Rāma and others, defeat Rāvaṇa in war and
<div n="lb"/>take her back. Sītā was not convinced about the power
<div n="lb"/>and prowess of Hanūmān. He then increased his body
<div n="lb"/>in size so that his limbs grew into the size of a mountain,
<div n="lb"/>hands into that of trees, head into that of a mountain
<div n="lb"/>peak, tail into that of a river etc. His breathing became
<div n="lb"/>akin to a storm. Then he roared in such a manner that
<div n="lb"/>even the very ends of the world shook and the people
<div n="lb"/>of Laṅkā were awakened by it.
<div n="NI"/>Sītā was now absolutely convinced of Hanūmān's bona
<div n="lb"/>fides and faithfulness. She handed over to him
<div n="lb"/>her Cūḍāmaṇi (ornament worn on the head) to be
[Page637-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>given to Rāma and also told him the following three
<div n="lb"/>words of recognition so that Rāma might be all the
<div n="lb"/>more convinced.
<div n="NI"/>(1) When Rāma first came to the garden near the
<div n="lb"/>palace in Mithilā I (Sītā) saw his reflection in the
<div n="lb"/>blue mirror in the veranda of my palace and the
<div n="lb"/>beauty of the reflection attracted me. I looked towards
<div n="lb"/>the garden to see the original of the reflection. Then he
<div n="lb"/>(Rāma) was looking down into the waters of the glass
<div n="lb"/>pond. He also saw my face reflected in the water and
<div n="lb"/>suddenly he looked at me. Our eyes met and in all
<div n="lb"/>shyness I hurried to and hid myself in the ladies'
<div n="lb"/>quarters.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Before our wedding I sent him through a faithful
<div n="lb"/>maid, a love letter to which he gave me a suitable
<div n="lb"/>reply.
<div n="NI"/>(3) After our wedding while we were living in Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>when one day I returned to our bedroom after a long
<div n="lb"/>chitchat with my younger sisters, my lord (Rāma) was
<div n="lb"/>lying on the cot in feigned sleep. Quietly I went up
<div n="lb"/>to him and kissed him on the lips. Because of the
<div n="lb"/>pressure on his lips and as my breast then touched his
<div n="lb"/>chest he pretended to have suddenly woken up and
<div n="lb"/>embraced me.
<div n="NI"/>Having received thus from Sītā the Cūḍāmaṇi and
<div n="lb"/>these words of recognition Hanūmān took leave of Sītā
<div n="lb"/>and with her implied sanction went about to have a
<div n="lb"/>look at Laṅkā. At one place he heard Vibhīṣaṇa
<div n="lb"/>reciting Viṣṇu's names. After wishing that this house
<div n="lb"/>of the devotee should turn into a royal abode he passed
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa's house. Then he came to Rāvaṇa's palace
<div n="lb"/>and gathered information about the Rākṣasa power.
<div n="lb"/>“Now I must see Rāvaṇa in person, let him know
<div n="lb"/>personally the fact of my visit and I would give him
<div n="lb"/>righteous advice”—with this object in view Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>began destroying the garden. He drove away the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas, who came to punish him and some of them
<div n="lb"/>were killed. At last Meghanāda (Indrajit) attacked
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān. Hiding in the sky he shot the Brahmāstra
<div n="lb"/>against Hanūmān, who yielded to it. The Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>took Hanūmān captive to Rāvaṇa. He freed himself of
<div n="lb"/>the cords that bound him, extended his tail which he
<div n="lb"/>shaped into circles, one over the other so that the last
<div n="lb"/>one rose more in height than Rāvaṇa's throne and
<div n="lb"/>seated himself on its top. Rāvaṇa and Hanūmān then
<div n="lb"/>began a conversation. Rāvaṇa, who got angry at the
<div n="lb"/>disrespect shown to him by Hanūmān, ordered the
<div n="lb"/>latter to be killed, but Vibhīṣaṇa opposed it saying that
<div n="lb"/>to kill emissaries and messengers was worse than killing
<div n="lb"/>one's own mother. Finally Rāvaṇa ordered that
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān's tail be set fire to and he be insulted and
<div n="lb"/>humiliated.
<div n="NI"/>Immediately Rākṣasas began to cover Hanūmān's tail
<div n="lb"/>with clothes. But, ths tail began growing longer and
<div n="lb"/>longer with the result that no quantity of clothings
<div n="lb"/>sufficed to completely cover the ever-extending tail.
<div n="lb"/>At last the Rākṣasas poured oil over the tail and set
<div n="lb"/>fire to it. Then Hanūmān broke loose from captivity
<div n="lb"/>and jumped up into the air causing universal disaster by
<div n="lb"/>fire in Laṅkā. The fire did not affect the palace of
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa and also the platform around the Śiṃśapā
<div n="lb"/>tree where Sītā sat. After thus burning down Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān extinguished the fire on his tail by dipping it
<div n="lb"/>in the ocean. Taking leave once again of Sītā,
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān crossed the sea and reached Mahendragiri.
[Page637-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>29) {%Rāma-Rāvaṇa war.%} Śrī Rāma and Sugrīva, who
<div n="lb"/>received Hanūmān's report about his visit to Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>started for it with an army of monkeys. They camped
<div n="lb"/>on the shores of the south sea. Rāvaṇa held a meeting
<div n="lb"/>of his war council attended by his brothers and others.
<div n="lb"/>He expelled Vibhīṣaṇa, who opposed war and advised
<div n="lb"/>his brother to return Sītā to Rāma and to apologise to
<div n="lb"/>him. Vibhīṣaṇa quitted Laṅkā and took refuge with
<div n="lb"/>Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Rāma and others, who had assembled on the sea-shore
<div n="lb"/>decided to build a bund to Laṅkā. The first thing Rāma
<div n="lb"/>did, for the successful conclusion of the expedition, was
<div n="lb"/>to install a Śivaliṅga at Rāmeśvara. (See under Rāmeś-
<div n="lb"/>vara). Then he prayed to Varuṇadeva for a passage
<div n="lb"/>across the sea. But, Varuṇa did not present himself
<div n="lb"/>and Śrī Rāma, angry with him, shot the āgneya
<div n="lb"/>(fiery) arrow into the heart of the sea when Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>appeared, saluted him and advised him to build a
<div n="lb"/>bund across the sea. As a reward for Varuṇa Śrī Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>as requested by the former, killed with one arrow all
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasas, who lived in Gāndhāra island on the
<div n="lb"/>north-western shore of the ocean. Varuṇa returned to
<div n="lb"/>his abode. The construction of the bund was begun
<div n="lb"/>under the leadership of Sugrīva with Nala as chief
<div n="lb"/>planner and Nīla as his co-planner. Jāmbavān and
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān functioned as supervisors and other monkeys
<div n="lb"/>as workers. Mountains, hills, rocks etc. were brought from
<div n="lb"/>various quarters and the construction of the bund was
<div n="lb"/>begun.
<div n="NI"/>Meanwhile, Rāvaṇa sent a great magician called
<div n="lb"/>Marutta disguised as King Janaka to Sītā to convert
<div n="lb"/>her to the side of Rāvaṇa. But, the attempt failed.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa then sent his two expert spies, Śuka and
<div n="lb"/>Sāraṇa disguised as monkeys to Rāma's camp. Jāmba-
<div n="lb"/>vān and Hanūmān captured and brought them before
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva. Weepingly they both sought refuge in Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>who set them free. They returned to Laṅkā and
<div n="lb"/>reported matters to Rāvaṇa, who felt a desire to have
<div n="lb"/>a look at Rāma for which purpose he, with his attend-
<div n="lb"/>ants, climbed to the top of the northern tower. Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>who knew about it by his spies climbed the heights of
<div n="lb"/>Subela mountain whence he stared at Rāvaṇa. Their
<div n="lb"/>eyes met in anger seeing which Sugrīva by one leap
<div n="lb"/>reached Rāvaṇa and kicked off to Rāma the crown
<div n="lb"/>from the central head of Rāvaṇa. After performing
<div n="lb"/>something like a destructive dance on Rāvaṇa's head
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva by another leap returned to Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Full of disappointment Rāvaṇa returned to his palace.
<div n="lb"/>His father-in-law, Mālyavān, tried his best to dissuade
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa from war, all to no purpose. Rāma sent an
<div n="lb"/>emissary to him to ask him to send Sītā back. Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>declined to oblige, and immediately war began. During
<div n="lb"/>the first day of the war, the majority of the Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>including their great leaders like Mahābāhu, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>pārśva, Mahodara, Mahākāya etc were killed. On the
<div n="lb"/>second day the Rākṣasa army under the command of
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya, son of Rāvaṇa, set out from the northern
<div n="lb"/>tower to fight. Lakṣmaṇa killed Atikāya with Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>stra. The other two Rākṣasa-commanders were
<div n="lb"/>Triśiras and Meghanāda. Lakṣmaṇa encountered them.
<div n="lb"/>When the latter failed to win by righteous fighting he
<div n="lb"/>resorted to cunningness. That too did not bring victory
<div n="lb"/>to him, and then he hid himself in the sky and shot
<div n="lb"/>the nāgāstra given to him by Śiva against the enemy.
<div n="lb"/>That arrow rendered Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva and all the
[Page638-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>monkeys unconscious. At that time Vibhīṣaṇa was away
<div n="lb"/>to arrange for food.
<div n="NI"/>When Vibhīṣaṇa returned with food he was taken
<div n="lb"/>aback to find Lakṣmaṇa and others lying in an uncons-
<div n="lb"/>cious condition. Rāma was informed about the matter
<div n="lb"/>and when he came to the battle-ground and saw
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, Hanūmān and all the others lying
<div n="lb"/>there unconscious he lost self-confidence for a short
<div n="lb"/>while and remarked that it was all the result of his
<div n="lb"/>having put faith in Vibhīṣaṇa, Rāvaṇa's brother whom
<div n="lb"/>he had put in charge of the battlefield. This comment
<div n="lb"/>of Rāma pained Vibhīṣaṇa much; but Śrī Rāma soon
<div n="lb"/>treated him kindly.
<div n="NI"/>Even the Devas who witnessed the scene were alarmed.
<div n="lb"/>But Rāma sat there for sometime immersed in medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation and then a light emerged from his right eye,
<div n="lb"/>shot towards the north and disappeared in the horizon.
<div n="lb"/>At once Garuḍa appeared on the scene from the west
<div n="lb"/>and removed with his beak the nāgāstra from
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa's body. Lakṣmaṇa jumped up from his
<div n="lb"/>unconscious state; Sugrīva and others also regained
<div n="lb"/>consciousness. In the fighting that followed all the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa leaders were killed. It was Hanūmān, who
<div n="lb"/>killed Kumbhakarṇa. At the time of his death
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhakarṇa made a last request to Rāma, i. e. his head
<div n="lb"/>should be cut off and thrown into the sea as otherwise
<div n="lb"/>the Rākṣasas would laugh at him to see the head from
<div n="lb"/>which the ears have been bitten off by monkeys.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Rāma got Hanūmān to throw Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa's head into the sea.
<div n="NI"/>Then Śrī Rāma told Lakṣmaṇa thus: Today I shall
<div n="lb"/>fight Indrajit. The war shall not continue yet further.
<div n="lb"/>Today Indrajit and tomorrow Rāvaṇa should be killed
<div n="lb"/>and the next day we will return to Ayodhyā. Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>answered:—“I shall fight Indrajit. I have told Vibhīṣaṇa
<div n="lb"/>that I will kill Indrajit within three days.”
<div n="NI"/>With Śrī Rāma's blessings Lakṣmaṇa began fighting
<div n="lb"/>again. Indrajit shot Nārāyaṇāstra which attracted by
<div n="lb"/>the ‘seven-letter-Mantra’ (Namo Nārāyaṇāya) of
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa circled him thrice and entered his quiver.
<div n="lb"/>The Rākṣasa minister called Mahodara converted his
<div n="lb"/>elephant into Airāvata and himself changed into
<div n="lb"/>Devendra and encountered Lakṣmaṇa. Saying that he
<div n="lb"/>had no quarrel with Indra and would not fight him
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa put down his bow, and Indrajit, exploiting
<div n="lb"/>the situation shot Brahmāstra against Lakṣmaṇa under
<div n="lb"/>cover of the clouds. Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva and others
<div n="lb"/>fainted. Then Śrī Rāma was in the army-camp,
<div n="lb"/>worshipping weapons to render them more powerful.
<div n="lb"/>Rāma returned to the battle-ground to find Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and others in life-less condition and crying like a mere
<div n="lb"/>ignorant fellow he lay by the side of Lakṣmaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa, who returned with food prayed for the grace
<div n="lb"/>of Devas. Indra appeared, gave to Vibhīṣaṇa Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>water in a golden vessel and asked it to be given to
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān and Jāmbavān, who, though unconscious
<div n="lb"/>were not dead.
<div n="NI"/>Vibhīṣaṇa did so and both Hanūmān and Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>regained consciousness. Jāmbavān told Hanūmān that
<div n="lb"/>if mṛtasañjīvinī (herbal medicine which will put life
<div n="lb"/>back into the dead) were brought from the distant
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas before dawn the next day all the dead ones
<div n="lb"/>like Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva could be brought back to
<div n="lb"/>life. (See under Mṛtasañjīvinī). Accordingly Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>started for the Himālayas. Meanwhile Indrajit had
[Page638-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>told Rāvaṇa about his victory, and as suggested by the
<div n="lb"/>latter Rākṣasa women took Sītā to the battlefield in the
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpaka Vimāna, showed her Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>others lying there in a life-less condition and told her
<div n="lb"/>that all of them were dead. Sītā wept aloud, but Trijaṭā
<div n="lb"/>consoled her by saying that the Puṣpaka Vimāna would
<div n="lb"/>not carry widows and therefore Rāma was not dead.
<div n="NI"/>Hanūmān returned before dawn the next day. As he
<div n="lb"/>could not distinguish mṛtasañjīvinī he had brought
<div n="lb"/>with him a mountain peak where the four medicinal
<div n="lb"/>plants, Śalyaharaṇī, Viśalyakaraṇī, Sandhānakaraṇī
<div n="lb"/>and Mṛtasañjīvinī grew. Jāmbavān distinguished
<div n="lb"/>mṛtasañjīvinī from the others and carried the four
<div n="lb"/>herbs into the battlefield. Contact with the air, which
<div n="lb"/>carried the smell of mṛtasañjīvinī brought the dead back
<div n="lb"/>to life. Viśalyakaraṇī removed all the arrows from their
<div n="lb"/>bodies and Sandhānakaraṇī healed the wounds.
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmaṇa again went out to fight Indrajit. Reluctant
<div n="lb"/>to fight with the former, Indrajit resorted to a new
<div n="lb"/>magical trick. He created an artificial or illusory
<div n="lb"/>Sītā and with her seated in a chariot he rose up in the
<div n="lb"/>sky and said as follows: “Rāvaṇa has abandoned Sītā
<div n="lb"/>who brings about humiliation to the Rākṣasas and
<div n="lb"/>ruin to Laṅkā. So, I cut her to pieces.” So saying he
<div n="lb"/>cut into two, by one stroke of his sword, Sītā, who
<div n="lb"/>cried Oh! my lord! oh! brother.” Blood fell on the
<div n="lb"/>battlefield and Indrajit disappeared. Though Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and others were alarmed by all these, Vibhīṣaṇa explain-
<div n="lb"/>ed that it was all the magic of the Rākṣasas, and in the
<div n="lb"/>fierce fighting that followed Lakṣmaṇa killed Indrajit.
<div n="lb"/>By now all the important and prominent Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>were killed. At last Rāvaṇa himself entered the battle-
<div n="lb"/>field. His first encounter was with Lakṣmaṇa. Then
<div n="lb"/>the fighting turned into one between Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. The former broke the bow of Rāvaṇa and did
<div n="lb"/>not want to fight with the weaponless Rākṣasa King.
<div n="lb"/>Next day Rāvaṇa brought Pātāla Rāvaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhodara to Laṅkā. Both of them entered Rāma's
<div n="lb"/>camp during night, but Pātāla Rāvaṇa, who realised
<div n="lb"/>that nothing could be achieved there returned to
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla with Kumbhodara. He built a tunnel from
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla upwards to earth, where in the fort created by
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān's tail twisted in a circle lay Śrī Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>others. The tunnel opened into this ‘fort’, and Pātāla
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa and his brother made Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>unconscious by making them inhale sammohana
<div n="lb"/>medicine and carried them off into Pātāla. Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa were laid in the court-yard of a Kālī temple
<div n="lb"/>to be sacrificed to Mahākālī the very same night.
<div n="lb"/>Arrangements for the sacrifice were completed.
<div n="NI"/>Hanūmān had been frequently looking inside the fort.
<div n="lb"/>As soon as the absence of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>noticed, Sugrīva and others, under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa reached the Kālī temple through the tunnel.
<div n="lb"/>In the fighting that followed Hanūmān killed Pātāla
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa and Aṅgada killed Mahodara. The only son
<div n="lb"/>of Pātāla Rāvaṇa, Sumālī, was crowned King of Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa entered the field again against Rāma. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>shot the Mahendra arrow against Rāvaṇa. The arrow,
<div n="lb"/>which represented in itself the effulgence of Mahendra,
<div n="lb"/>the hardness of diamonds, the intensity of fire and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu's glow cut off the ten heads of Rāvaṇa. His
<div n="lb"/>physical body fell on earth and his spirit ascended to
<div n="lb"/>heaven.
[Page639-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>30). {%Return.%} Rāma and others, who were pleased with
<div n="lb"/>the turn of events, crowned Vibhīṣaṇa King of Laṅkā.
<div n="lb"/>Trijaṭā was put in charge of dressing Sītā in new
<div n="lb"/>clothes. Apsarās appeared on the scene. Śacīdevī
<div n="lb"/>presented to Sītā a chain, Urvaśī an ornament for
<div n="lb"/>the head, Menakā, two bangles, Rambhā a waist-let,
<div n="lb"/>Tilottamā a set of chains for the feet, and Anasūyā, wife
<div n="lb"/>of Atri, a Cūḍāmaṇi. When she wore all these orna-
<div n="lb"/>ments Sītā appeared to be equal to Lakṣmīdevī in
<div n="lb"/>grandeur and charm. She was brought in a palanquin
<div n="lb"/>to Śrī Rāma by Vibhīṣaṇa and others. Rāma was taken
<div n="lb"/>aback by the glamorous dress, ornaments etc. of Śītā,
<div n="lb"/>and immediately a suspicion arose in his mind, and he
<div n="lb"/>kept mum after asking Lakṣmaṇa to do whatever Sītā
<div n="lb"/>wanted. As soon as she heard those words of Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>Sītā asked Lakṣmaṇa to light a funeral pyre saying that
<div n="lb"/>the woman suspected by her husband should not live
<div n="lb"/>and so she (Sītā) would quit her life in the very
<div n="lb"/>presence of Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmaṇa cast a pathetic look at Rāma; but his face
<div n="lb"/>exhibited no change of feeling. He granted Sītā's re-
<div n="lb"/>quest by his silence. Those present there awaited develop-
<div n="lb"/>ments with bated breath. Lakṣmaṇa, with the help
<div n="lb"/>of the monkeys got a pyre ready. After going round
<div n="lb"/>Rāma with folded hands Sītā leapt into the glowing fire.
<div n="lb"/>Within a very short time three divine forms emerged
<div n="lb"/>from the fire, Svāhādevī, Sītādevī and God Agni.
<div n="NI"/>His suspicions having thus vanished Rāma welcomed
<div n="lb"/>Sītā back and the next day they left for Ayodhyā in the
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpaka Vimāna. Vibhīṣaṇa, Sugrīva, Hanūmān and
<div n="lb"/>others followed them. After reaching Ayodhyā Rāma
<div n="lb"/>returned the Puṣpaka to Kubera. Bharata came back
<div n="lb"/>from Nandigrāma. In the presence of all relations
<div n="lb"/>and others concerned the coronation of Rāma as king
<div n="lb"/>took place. Bharata was appointed crown Prince, Lakṣ-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa Commander-in-chief of armies and Śatrughna,
<div n="lb"/>Finance minister.
<div n="NI"/>31) {%Sītā abandoned.%} Under Rāma's rule the country
<div n="lb"/>overflowed with milk and honey. Nobody had to fear
<div n="lb"/>anything from enemies. He made Sītā kill Sahasramukha
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. (For details see under Sahasramukharāvaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma used to go about the country in disguise to
<div n="lb"/>enquire about the welfare of his subjects. On a particular
<div n="lb"/>dawn he happened to be standing outside the house of
<div n="lb"/>a washerman. The washerman scolded his wife, who
<div n="lb"/>had gone out of the house that night for something.
<div n="lb"/>He suspected that she had gone to meet her paramour.
<div n="lb"/>He bluntly told his wife that he was not prepared to
<div n="lb"/>act like Rāma, who had accepted Sītā, though she had
<div n="lb"/>lived with another person. Śrī Rāma, who heard the
<div n="lb"/>above talk, returned to his palace very sad. After
<div n="lb"/>thinking about for a long time he decided that it was
<div n="lb"/>his duty to abandon Sītā in the interests of his subjects.
<div n="lb"/>Then Sītā was in the seventh month of her pregnancy. She
<div n="lb"/>had on the previous day, expressed a desire to go to the
<div n="lb"/>forest areas once again. Rāma considered this as the
<div n="lb"/>most suitable opportunity to abandon Sītā in the forest
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa was entrusted with the matter. That
<div n="lb"/>day at Sun-rise Lakṣmaṇa took Sītā in a chariot to the
<div n="lb"/>suburbs of Vālmīki's āśrama, abandoned her there and
<div n="lb"/>returned to the palace. (According to the Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>written by Kamba, a Tamil author, it is said that Sītā
<div n="lb"/>was left in the suburbs of Gautama's hut. There, Sītā
<div n="lb"/>who was pregnant was looked after by Ahalyā, the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Gautama.) Weeping aloud Sītā fell down. Young
[Page639-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>munis—Vālmīki's disciples—saw her and took her to
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama. At the āśrama she delivered two sons, Kuśa
<div n="lb"/>and Lava.
<div n="NI"/>32) {%Aśvamedha.%} After abandoning Sītā in the forests
<div n="lb"/>Rāma led a sad life for five years. Yet, he decided to
<div n="lb"/>perform an Aśvamedha yajña. As soon as Rāma thought
<div n="lb"/>of him, Hanūmān appeared and he was deputed to in-
<div n="lb"/>vite Vibhīṣaṇa, Sugrīva and others from Laṅkā and
<div n="lb"/>Kiṣkindhā and the feudatory princes and armies from
<div n="lb"/>other countries.
<div n="NI"/>Sugrīva was put in charge of the armies, Vibhīṣaṇa in
<div n="lb"/>charge of finance, and central authority was vested in
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa. Then the yājñic horse, accompanied
<div n="lb"/>by the army, was let loose to travel all over the
<div n="lb"/>country. Accompanied by cavalry, the elephant division,
<div n="lb"/>infantry and the chariot-force the horse went about the
<div n="lb"/>various kingdoms. The army, on its way back to Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>with presents collected from many kingdoms, encamped
<div n="lb"/>for rest near Vālmīki's āśrama when Kuśa and Lava
<div n="lb"/>tied the yājñic horse, which was strolling there unfetter-
<div n="lb"/>ed. Consequent upon this action of Kuśa and Lava a fight
<div n="lb"/>broke out between them and the king's army in which
<div n="lb"/>the latter got defeated. Even the arrows of Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>failed to have any effect on the boys. The boys having
<div n="lb"/>not returned even though it had become very late in
<div n="lb"/>the evening, the āśramites went in search of them and
<div n="lb"/>it was only when they came to the scene of fighting did
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa and others know who the boys really were.
<div n="NI"/>During this period of time infants' death was very much
<div n="lb"/>on the increase in Ayodhyā. It was believed that such
<div n="lb"/>deaths increased when Śūdras did tapas, and to find out
<div n="lb"/>if any Śūdra was engaged in tapas Rāma flew over the
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍaka forest where he found a Śūdra called Śambūka
<div n="lb"/>performing tapas hanging down from the branch of a
<div n="lb"/>tree with his head down. Rāma killed him and his
<div n="lb"/>spirit got salvation. Afterwards, appreciating the beauties
<div n="lb"/>of the forest Rāma came near Vālmīki's āśrama where
<div n="lb"/>he and Sītā met face to face. Kuśa and Lava also came
<div n="lb"/>there and they noticed with surprise the change in
<div n="lb"/>appearance brought about in their mother and Rāma
<div n="lb"/>on their meeting each other. When they heard from
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān the real facts about Rāma they withdrew
<div n="lb"/>their arrows and prostrated at the feet of Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma then, with the consent of all and in accord-
<div n="lb"/>ance with his own desire, took back Sītā and returned
<div n="lb"/>with her to Ayodhyā. Lakṣmaṇa and others followed him.
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā and others received Sītā most heartily. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, who till then was having no wife, had made
<div n="lb"/>a golden image of Sītā for the purposes of the a va-
<div n="lb"/>medha. Now, since the real Sītā was with him the idol
<div n="lb"/>was an unnecessary thing. The Aśvamedhayajña went
<div n="lb"/>off very well.
<div n="NI"/>33) {%The end.%} Śrī Rāma's reign became all the more
<div n="lb"/>prosperous. It was during this period that Rāma, as
<div n="lb"/>desired by the munis in the Yamunā plain, killed
<div n="lb"/>Lavaṇāsura, son of Madhu in the great city called
<div n="lb"/>Durga in the centre of the Madhu forest. (For details
<div n="lb"/>see under Lavaṇa). After Lavaṇa's death, a sect of
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas called Śailūṣas, who lived on the shores
<div n="lb"/>of the eastern sea, proved to be enemies of Ayodhyā.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma annihilated them also. Kaikeyī began getting
<div n="lb"/>jealous of the prosperity and happiness of Sītā. One
<div n="lb"/>day when Rāma had gone to hunt in the forest, Kaikeyī
<div n="lb"/>closely questioned Sītā over particulars in Laṅkā and
<div n="lb"/>prevailed upon her, overruling her unwillingness, to
[Page640-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>draw a picture of Rāvaṇa. Sītā drew on a piece of
<div n="lb"/>‘sitting-plank’ Rāvaṇa's figure with the ten heads.
<div n="lb"/>Kaikeyī took away the picture on the pretext of exhi-
<div n="lb"/>biting it in the ladies' quarters, and gave it to Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>when he returned from hunting, to sit on at the time
<div n="lb"/>of Pūjā (worship). Rāma got angry to find Rāvaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>picture drawn on the ‘sitting plank’. Kaikeyī then told
<div n="lb"/>him that it was Sītā, who had drawn the picture and
<div n="lb"/>also that she usually praised Laṅkā and Rāvaṇa. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>pronounced the death penalty on Sītā for having drawn
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa's picture. The inmates of the palace
<div n="lb"/>shuddered to hear the judgement. When Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>seated Sītā on the floor to kill her, Bhūmidevī (earth)
<div n="lb"/>rent itself open into two and carried her off through the
<div n="lb"/>opening.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma grew sadder and sadder following the dis-
<div n="lb"/>appearance of Sītā. Ill omens began to appear in
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā in increasing measure. One day a divine Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>whom the people of Ayodhyā had not seen till then,
<div n="lb"/>came to Rāma's palace. He told Rāma that he had to
<div n="lb"/>impart certain secrets to the latter and after making
<div n="lb"/>Rāma vow that no one would enter the room while
<div n="lb"/>they were conversing and that if any one did come
<div n="lb"/>when they were talking, he should either be killed or
<div n="lb"/>forsaken for ever, he began to talk with Rāma in a
<div n="lb"/>secluded spot. Rāma posted Lakṣmaṇa at the entrance
<div n="lb"/>with the strict injunctions that nobody should come
<div n="lb"/>into their presence. Within a short time great munis
<div n="lb"/>like Sanaka came there and told Lakṣmaṇa that they
<div n="lb"/>wanted to see Rāma. They were not prepared to wait
<div n="lb"/>even for a short time as requested by Lakṣmaṇa, but
<div n="lb"/>threatened ruin to the royal family. Lakṣmaṇa then,
<div n="lb"/>was prepared to suffer the consequence, and went to
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and told him about the arrival of Sanaka and
<div n="lb"/>others. Rāma, in keeping with his vow, banished
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa immediately. But, when Rāma came out and
<div n="lb"/>looked for Sanaka and others no one was to be found
<div n="lb"/>anywhere there. When he returned to the inner apart-
<div n="lb"/>ment the Ṛṣi also was not to be seen. In fact they were
<div n="lb"/>Kāla and his emissaries deputed by Brahmā to recall
<div n="lb"/>Rāma as the object of his incarnation was already
<div n="lb"/>achieved.
<div n="NI"/>Rāma, who had already been suffering mental agony
<div n="lb"/>on account of Sītā's departure, lost all peace of mind
<div n="lb"/>as Lakṣmaṇa's banishment followed Sītā's departure.
<div n="lb"/>He decided to put an end to his life for which purpose
<div n="lb"/>he went to the river Sarayū. All the dependants followed
<div n="lb"/>him. While the great mass of people who thronged
<div n="lb"/>both the banks of the river burst out into weeping Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and his followers drowned themselves in the
<div n="lb"/>waters of the Sarayū, and their spirits attained Vai-
<div n="lb"/>kuṇṭha. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Tulasīdāsa Rāmāyaṇa).
