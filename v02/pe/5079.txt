<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
Brahmā—Marīci—Paurṇamāsa—Parvata.
<div n="NI"/>Prajāpati Marīci got of his wife Sambhūti a son named
Paurṇamāsa. Paurṇamāsa got two sons Virajas and
Parvata. Parvata's mother was the sister of Nārada.
(Chapter 10, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Nārada and Parvata.%} These two sages lived for a
long time as inseparable friends. Once they travelled on
earth in the form of human beings. They decided that
each should speak out what he felt without reserve and
if anybody broke the arrangement the other had the
right to curse him.
<div n="NI"/>During their travels they reached the palace of a King
called Sṛñjaya (Sañjaya) and they stayed there as his
guests for a long time. Damayantī (Madayantī)
daughter of the King served them both and Nārada
fell in love with her. Nārada hid this fact from
Parvata and within a few days Parvata came to know
it and he according to the agreement cursed Nārada to
take the form of a monkey. Nārada gave a counter
curse disabling Parvata from attaining Svarga. Both
separated from there and after some time both lost their
bitterness against each other. Parvata met Nārada in
his monkey form in a forest. Both were sorry for their
curses then and each withdrew his curse and Nārada
got his original form. He married Damayantī and
started living together and Parvata went to Svarga.
