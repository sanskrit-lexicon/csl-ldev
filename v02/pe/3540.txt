KINDAMA¦. A great sage. Once sage Kindama and
his wife were roaming in the forest in the form of deer.
While hunting, King Pāṇḍu discharged his arrow
against the he-deer. It assumed its original form as
sage Kindama and told the King that it was wrong on
his part to have hit him (the sage) while he was
engaged in love play. “I am dying, but in future if
you physically contact your wife you too will die.” After
saying so the sage fell down dead. Pāṇḍu could never
have children of his own from his wives due to this
curse. He forgot all about the curse once, embraced
Mādrī and fell down dead. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 117).
