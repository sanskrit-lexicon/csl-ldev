VĀMANA I¦. An incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} There are ten main incarnations
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu. Of these, the incarnation of Vāmana is
<div n="lb"/>the fifth.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Two Vāmanas.%} Two different stories occur in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas about the incarnation of Vāmana. One story
<div n="lb"/>is about how Mahāviṣṇu took the incarnation of Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>and thrust Mahābali an asura, down to the nether-
<div n="lb"/>world. This story is more widely known. In the second
<div n="lb"/>story the place of Mahābali is given to the asura called
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu. This is the main difference. For a compara-
<div n="lb"/>tive study, both stories are given below:
<div n="NI"/>a) {%The first story of the incarnation of Vāmana.%} The devas
<div n="lb"/>(gods) such as Indra and the others were born to Prajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati Kaśyapa by his wife Aditi and the asuras (demons)
<div n="lb"/>such as Mahābali and others, by his wife Diti. The
<div n="lb"/>Daityas (asuras) began to harm and harass the Devas
<div n="lb"/>to a great extent. Once Aditi, the mother of the Devas,
<div n="lb"/>complained to Kaśyapa about this. He advised her to
<div n="lb"/>take the fast called ‘Payovrata’ fixing the image of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu in her heart and that he will take birth
<div n="lb"/>through her as Vāmana and destroy Mahābali. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the advice of her husband, Aditi began to take
<div n="lb"/>Payovrata, at the end of which Mahāviṣṇu appeared
<div n="lb"/>before her and asked her what her wish was. She told
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, of her grievances and Viṣṇu consoled her and
<div n="lb"/>said “You have invoked me by your prayer and fast
<div n="lb"/>for the safety of your sons. So I will enter your womb
<div n="lb"/>through the penance of Kaśyapa and take birth as your
<div n="lb"/>son and rescue your sons.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu disappeared. Aditi worshipped her husband
<div n="lb"/>with devotion. By contemplation Kaśyapa knew every-
<div n="lb"/>thing. He infused the energy he had acquired by
<div n="lb"/>penance into Aditi, who gave birth to a son. The birth
<div n="lb"/>took place on the twelfth day of the month of Bhādra-
<div n="lb"/>pada, in the bright lunar fortnight at the auspicious
<div n="lb"/>moment called Abhijit, in the star of Śrāvaṇa. The
<div n="lb"/>infant had four hands. While Kaśyapa and Aditi were
<div n="lb"/>looking on, the infant changed its form and became a
<div n="lb"/>dwarfish Brahmin boy. The Devas brought presents
<div n="lb"/>to the child. The Sun taught him the spell called Sāvitrī-
<div n="lb"/>mantra. Bṛhaspati gave the Brahmastring. Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>gave the string worn round the waist. The earth gave
<div n="lb"/>the hide of a black antelope. Soma the Vanaspati gave
<div n="lb"/>a rod; Aditi gave the cloth over the privities, the sky
<div n="lb"/>an umbrella, the seven hermits gave Kuśa-grass, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>gave a waterpot, Sarasvatī gave a rosary and Kubera
<div n="lb"/>gave a pot.
<div n="NI"/>At that time, the powerful Mahābali had brought the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds of heaven, earth and Pātāla (the nether-
<div n="lb"/>world) under his control. That Asura King performed
<div n="lb"/>a horse-sacrifice with the help of a Bhārgava Brahmin.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing about it Vāmana started for the place of sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice. Mahābali was performing the sacrifice at a place
<div n="lb"/>called Bhṛgukacchaka on the North bank of river
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā. The priests who were performing the rites
[Page824-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and ceremonies of the sacrifice saw Vāmana coming
<div n="lb"/>slowly to the sacrificial hall. They wondered whether it
<div n="lb"/>was the Sun, Sanatkumāra or Agni (Fire) coming to
<div n="lb"/>see the sacrifice. While they were standing thus, Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>with his umbrella, rod and water pot filled with water
<div n="lb"/>entered the sacrificial hall. Mahābali welcomed Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>and asked him the purpose of his visit. Vāmana said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh King! Your words are sweet. Noble Asura! give
<div n="lb"/>me three feet of ground which I measure with my feet.
<div n="lb"/>That is all what I want.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahābali agreed. The teacher-priest Śukra felt some
<div n="lb"/>doubts regarding the identity of Vāmana. So he secret-
<div n="lb"/>ly told Mahābali that the boy Vāmana was none other
<div n="lb"/>than Mahāviṣṇu and as such, he should not give any
<div n="lb"/>promise. But Mahābali had already given the promise.
<div n="lb"/>He refused to go back upon his words. The priest
<div n="lb"/>Śukra got angry at this and cursed Mahābali thus.
<div n="lb"/>“You boast that you are wise and learned. But you are
<div n="lb"/>disobedient, slow-witted and unwise. So all your
<div n="lb"/>prosperities will be destroyed.”
<div n="NI"/>Though he was cursed, he did not deviate from the
<div n="lb"/>path of truth. He gave the promised ground to
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana by pouring water with the water brought
<div n="lb"/>in golden pot by his queen Vindhyāvalī. The names,
<div n="lb"/>Aśanā and Koṭarā also are used in the Purāṇas for
<div n="lb"/>Vindhyāvalī the wife of Mahābali. She came out for
<div n="lb"/>the purpose wearing golden ornaments. Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>himself washed the feet of Vāmana, who instantly
<div n="lb"/>began to grow and became large beyond imagination.
<div n="lb"/>Everybody on the spot was amazed at the unimagin-
<div n="lb"/>able bigness of Vāmana. On that huge figure, Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>saw the priest, the performers of sacrificial rites, the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficial hall, the universe, the elements, the qualities the
<div n="lb"/>senses, the mind, the individual spirits, and at the feet
<div n="lb"/>of the figure the world Rasātala. He saw the earth on
<div n="lb"/>its feet, mountains below the knees, birds on its knees,
<div n="lb"/>the Maruts on its thighs, evening on its clothes, the
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpatis on its privities, the noble and mighty asuras
<div n="lb"/>on its lions, the sky on its navel, the oceans on its stomach,
<div n="lb"/>Dharma (duty) in its heart, rightness and truth on its
<div n="lb"/>breasts, Mahālakṣmī holding lotus on its chest, songs
<div n="lb"/>of Sāman and all other voices in its neck, all the gods
<div n="lb"/>beginning with Indra on its hands, the points (direct-
<div n="lb"/>ions) on its ears, the ether on its head, the clouds on
<div n="lb"/>its hair, breaths in its nose, the sun in its eyes, fire on
<div n="lb"/>its face, the Vedas in its words, Varuṇa in its tongue,
<div n="lb"/>day and night agreement and disagreement in its wink-
<div n="lb"/>ing and anger on its forehead. In its touch there was
<div n="lb"/>desire, in its radiance there was water, in its buttocks
<div n="lb"/>Jawlessness, sacrifice in its steps, death in its shadow,
<div n="lb"/>illusion in its laugh, medicines in its hairs, rivers in its
<div n="lb"/>veins, stones in its nails, Brahmā in its intelligence,
<div n="lb"/>hermits, devas etc. in its life-breaths. Thus the figure
<div n="lb"/>was seen by Mahābali. Vāmana had trodden on the
<div n="lb"/>whole of the earth, which was completely under the
<div n="lb"/>control of Mahābali, with one foot, filled the whole of
<div n="lb"/>the sky with his large body and the four points were filled
<div n="lb"/>with his hands. The second step was put on Maharloka,
<div n="lb"/>Janaloka and Tapoloka (three worlds). No spot was
<div n="lb"/>left in the universe for a third step.
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana said:—“You have given me three feet of
<div n="lb"/>ground. I have measured two feet of ground. Show me
<div n="lb"/>the place to measure the third step. I have measured
<div n="lb"/>the earth with one step and the heaven with the second
<div n="lb"/>step. You have seen it. If you cannot keep your promise
[Page824-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>you had better go down to Pātāla.” Bali requested him
<div n="lb"/>to place the third step on his head. Vāmana placed his
<div n="lb"/>foot on the head of Mahābali and thrust him down to
<div n="lb"/>Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana brought Indra to the spot and anointed him
<div n="lb"/>as the ruler of heaven, in the presence of all the gods
<div n="lb"/>and hermits. Indra sent Vāmana with the Lokapālas
<div n="lb"/>(Indra, Agni, Yama and Varuṇa) in a divine Vimāna
<div n="lb"/>to the world of Viṣṇu. (Bhāgavata Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>b) {%The second story of the incarnation of Vāmana.%} Dhundhu,
<div n="lb"/>an asura boy, was born to Kaśyapa by his wife Danu.
<div n="lb"/>That asura did penance and pleased Brahmā. He made
<div n="lb"/>a request that he should not be killed by Indra and
<div n="lb"/>the other gods or anybody else. Brahmā, who was
<div n="lb"/>pleased at his penance, gave him the boon he asked.
<div n="lb"/>The boy Dhundhu, at the beginning of the fourth
<div n="lb"/>Kaliyuga, during the period of Hiraṇyakaśipu, went to
<div n="lb"/>heaven and defeating Indra and the other Devas,
<div n="lb"/>established his rule there as Indra. The mighty
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu was travelling on the mountain Mandara
<div n="lb"/>as an official under Dhundhu.
<div n="NI"/>The defeated and grief-stricken Devas went to the
<div n="lb"/>world of Brahmā and lived there. Dhundhu, who knew
<div n="lb"/>this, wanted to drive them out of that place also. He
<div n="lb"/>requested Śukra, the priest and teacher of asuras, to
<div n="lb"/>tell him the means of doing it.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra said. “Devendra was enabled to enter the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Brahmā, because he had performed one
<div n="lb"/>hundred horse-sacrifices. “Hearing this, Dhundhu, with
<div n="lb"/>the permission of the teacher Śukra, began to perform
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice in the holy place called Prācīna tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that Dhundhu had begun the horse-sacrifice,
<div n="lb"/>Indra and the Devas trembled with fear and, leaving
<div n="lb"/>the world of Brahmā, went to the world of Viṣṇu and
<div n="lb"/>prayed for protection. Bhagavān came to know of
<div n="lb"/>everything and consoled them and sent them back.
<div n="lb"/>After this Mahāviṣṇu took the form of a Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>and jumped into the Devikājala and lay afloat like a
<div n="lb"/>piece of dry wood. Dhundhu and the hermits saw by
<div n="lb"/>chance, Vāmana sinking and coming up in the water.
<div n="lb"/>They took the Vāmana-Brahmin out of water and asked
<div n="lb"/>him how he had fallen in water. Vāmana replied with
<div n="lb"/>shiver:—“In the family of Varuṇa there was a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Prabhāsa, who was a scholar. I am Gatibhāsa,
<div n="lb"/>the younger of his two sons. After the death of father,
<div n="lb"/>I requested my brother to divide the property of our
<div n="lb"/>father. My brother quoted several rules and said that
<div n="lb"/>I was not entitled to get any portion of my father's
<div n="lb"/>wealth. I spoke against him and getting angry he
<div n="lb"/>caught me by my hair and threw me into the river. It
<div n="lb"/>is a year since I, being not able to swim, began to sink
<div n="lb"/>and come up in this river. Thus you have seen me
<div n="lb"/>here.”
<div n="NI"/>The Bhārgavas who were present there, requested
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu thus. “Oh! King of the asuras! Be pleased
<div n="lb"/>to give this boy a well-furnished house, servant-maids
<div n="lb"/>and plenty of wealth.” Hearing this Dhundhu said to
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana. “I will provide you with wealth, servant-
<div n="lb"/>maids, house, gold, cows, land, clothes etc.”
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana humbly said to Dhundhu “Oh Lord! I do
<div n="lb"/>not want any wealth. It is my desire for wealth that
<div n="lb"/>has brought me to this plight. I request you to give
<div n="lb"/>me only three feet of ground.”
<div n="NI"/>As soon as the asura-King complied with his request,
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana began to grow like the moon. He assumed the
[Page825-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>shape of Trivikrama to measure each of the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds with a foot. In two steps he measured all the
<div n="lb"/>worlds. Vāmana whose body was bigger than Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru became angry when he did not see place to
<div n="lb"/>measure the third step, and fell on Dhundhu. By this
<div n="lb"/>heavy fall there appeared a great cavity thirty thousand
<div n="lb"/>yojanas deep. Bhagavān Viṣṇu took the asura Dhundhu
<div n="lb"/>and threw him into that deep pit with a mighty force,
<div n="lb"/>and by a shower of dust he filled the cavity.
<div n="NI"/>Indra with the Devas occupied the world of Gods.
<div n="lb"/>Leaving the asura King in the sea of dust, Bhagavān
<div n="lb"/>jumped into the river Kālindī and disappeared. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 78).
