VĀMANA I¦. An incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} There are ten main incarnations
of Mahāviṣṇu. Of these, the incarnation of Vāmana is
the fifth.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Two Vāmanas.%} Two different stories occur in the
Purāṇas about the incarnation of Vāmana. One story
is about how Mahāviṣṇu took the incarnation of Vāmana
and thrust Mahābali an asura, down to the nether-
world. This story is more widely known. In the second
story the place of Mahābali is given to the asura called
Dhundhu. This is the main difference. For a compara-
tive study, both stories are given below:
<div n="NI"/>a) {%The first story of the incarnation of Vāmana.%} The devas
(gods) such as Indra and the others were born to Prajā-
pati Kaśyapa by his wife Aditi and the asuras (demons)
such as Mahābali and others, by his wife Diti. The
Daityas (asuras) began to harm and harass the Devas
to a great extent. Once Aditi, the mother of the Devas,
complained to Kaśyapa about this. He advised her to
take the fast called ‘Payovrata’ fixing the image of
Mahāviṣṇu in her heart and that he will take birth
through her as Vāmana and destroy Mahābali. Accord-
ing to the advice of her husband, Aditi began to take
Payovrata, at the end of which Mahāviṣṇu appeared
before her and asked her what her wish was. She told
Viṣṇu, of her grievances and Viṣṇu consoled her and
said “You have invoked me by your prayer and fast
for the safety of your sons. So I will enter your womb
through the penance of Kaśyapa and take birth as your
son and rescue your sons.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu disappeared. Aditi worshipped her husband
with devotion. By contemplation Kaśyapa knew every-
thing. He infused the energy he had acquired by
penance into Aditi, who gave birth to a son. The birth
took place on the twelfth day of the month of Bhādra-
pada, in the bright lunar fortnight at the auspicious
moment called Abhijit, in the star of Śrāvaṇa. The
infant had four hands. While Kaśyapa and Aditi were
looking on, the infant changed its form and became a
dwarfish Brahmin boy. The Devas brought presents
to the child. The Sun taught him the spell called Sāvitrī-
mantra. Bṛhaspati gave the Brahmastring. Kaśyapa
gave the string worn round the waist. The earth gave
the hide of a black antelope. Soma the Vanaspati gave
a rod; Aditi gave the cloth over the privities, the sky
an umbrella, the seven hermits gave Kuśa-grass, Brahmā
gave a waterpot, Sarasvatī gave a rosary and Kubera
gave a pot.
<div n="NI"/>At that time, the powerful Mahābali had brought the
three worlds of heaven, earth and Pātāla (the nether-
world) under his control. That Asura King performed
a horse-sacrifice with the help of a Bhārgava Brahmin.
Hearing about it Vāmana started for the place of sacri-
fice. Mahābali was performing the sacrifice at a place
called Bhṛgukacchaka on the North bank of river
Narmadā. The priests who were performing the rites
[Page824-a+ 65]
and ceremonies of the sacrifice saw Vāmana coming
slowly to the sacrificial hall. They wondered whether it
was the Sun, Sanatkumāra or Agni (Fire) coming to
see the sacrifice. While they were standing thus, Vāmana
with his umbrella, rod and water pot filled with water
entered the sacrificial hall. Mahābali welcomed Vāmana
and asked him the purpose of his visit. Vāmana said
“Oh King! Your words are sweet. Noble Asura! give
me three feet of ground which I measure with my feet.
That is all what I want.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahābali agreed. The teacher-priest Śukra felt some
doubts regarding the identity of Vāmana. So he secret-
ly told Mahābali that the boy Vāmana was none other
than Mahāviṣṇu and as such, he should not give any
promise. But Mahābali had already given the promise.
He refused to go back upon his words. The priest
Śukra got angry at this and cursed Mahābali thus.
“You boast that you are wise and learned. But you are
disobedient, slow-witted and unwise. So all your
prosperities will be destroyed.”
<div n="NI"/>Though he was cursed, he did not deviate from the
path of truth. He gave the promised ground to
Vāmana by pouring water with the water brought
in golden pot by his queen Vindhyāvalī. The names,
Aśanā and Koṭarā also are used in the Purāṇas for
Vindhyāvalī the wife of Mahābali. She came out for
the purpose wearing golden ornaments. Mahābali
himself washed the feet of Vāmana, who instantly
began to grow and became large beyond imagination.
Everybody on the spot was amazed at the unimagin-
able bigness of Vāmana. On that huge figure, Mahābali
saw the priest, the performers of sacrificial rites, the sacri-
ficial hall, the universe, the elements, the qualities the
senses, the mind, the individual spirits, and at the feet
of the figure the world Rasātala. He saw the earth on
its feet, mountains below the knees, birds on its knees,
the Maruts on its thighs, evening on its clothes, the
Prajāpatis on its privities, the noble and mighty asuras
on its lions, the sky on its navel, the oceans on its stomach,
Dharma (duty) in its heart, rightness and truth on its
breasts, Mahālakṣmī holding lotus on its chest, songs
of Sāman and all other voices in its neck, all the gods
beginning with Indra on its hands, the points (direct-
ions) on its ears, the ether on its head, the clouds on
its hair, breaths in its nose, the sun in its eyes, fire on
its face, the Vedas in its words, Varuṇa in its tongue,
day and night agreement and disagreement in its wink-
ing and anger on its forehead. In its touch there was
desire, in its radiance there was water, in its buttocks
Jawlessness, sacrifice in its steps, death in its shadow,
illusion in its laugh, medicines in its hairs, rivers in its
veins, stones in its nails, Brahmā in its intelligence,
hermits, devas etc. in its life-breaths. Thus the figure
was seen by Mahābali. Vāmana had trodden on the
whole of the earth, which was completely under the
control of Mahābali, with one foot, filled the whole of
the sky with his large body and the four points were filled
with his hands. The second step was put on Maharloka,
Janaloka and Tapoloka (three worlds). No spot was
left in the universe for a third step.
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana said:—“You have given me three feet of
ground. I have measured two feet of ground. Show me
the place to measure the third step. I have measured
the earth with one step and the heaven with the second
step. You have seen it. If you cannot keep your promise
[Page824-b+ 65]
you had better go down to Pātāla.” Bali requested him
to place the third step on his head. Vāmana placed his
foot on the head of Mahābali and thrust him down to
Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana brought Indra to the spot and anointed him
as the ruler of heaven, in the presence of all the gods
and hermits. Indra sent Vāmana with the Lokapālas
(Indra, Agni, Yama and Varuṇa) in a divine Vimāna
to the world of Viṣṇu. (Bhāgavata Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>b) {%The second story of the incarnation of Vāmana.%} Dhundhu,
an asura boy, was born to Kaśyapa by his wife Danu.
That asura did penance and pleased Brahmā. He made
a request that he should not be killed by Indra and
the other gods or anybody else. Brahmā, who was
pleased at his penance, gave him the boon he asked.
The boy Dhundhu, at the beginning of the fourth
Kaliyuga, during the period of Hiraṇyakaśipu, went to
heaven and defeating Indra and the other Devas,
established his rule there as Indra. The mighty
Hiraṇyakaśipu was travelling on the mountain Mandara
as an official under Dhundhu.
<div n="NI"/>The defeated and grief-stricken Devas went to the
world of Brahmā and lived there. Dhundhu, who knew
this, wanted to drive them out of that place also. He
requested Śukra, the priest and teacher of asuras, to
tell him the means of doing it.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra said. “Devendra was enabled to enter the
presence of Brahmā, because he had performed one
hundred horse-sacrifices. “Hearing this, Dhundhu, with
the permission of the teacher Śukra, began to perform
sacrifice in the holy place called Prācīna tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that Dhundhu had begun the horse-sacrifice,
Indra and the Devas trembled with fear and, leaving
the world of Brahmā, went to the world of Viṣṇu and
prayed for protection. Bhagavān came to know of
everything and consoled them and sent them back.
After this Mahāviṣṇu took the form of a Vāmana
and jumped into the Devikājala and lay afloat like a
piece of dry wood. Dhundhu and the hermits saw by
chance, Vāmana sinking and coming up in the water.
They took the Vāmana-Brahmin out of water and asked
him how he had fallen in water. Vāmana replied with
shiver:—“In the family of Varuṇa there was a Brahmin
named Prabhāsa, who was a scholar. I am Gatibhāsa,
the younger of his two sons. After the death of father,
I requested my brother to divide the property of our
father. My brother quoted several rules and said that
I was not entitled to get any portion of my father's
wealth. I spoke against him and getting angry he
caught me by my hair and threw me into the river. It
is a year since I, being not able to swim, began to sink
and come up in this river. Thus you have seen me
here.”
<div n="NI"/>The Bhārgavas who were present there, requested
Dhundhu thus. “Oh! King of the asuras! Be pleased
to give this boy a well-furnished house, servant-maids
and plenty of wealth.” Hearing this Dhundhu said to
Vāmana. “I will provide you with wealth, servant-
maids, house, gold, cows, land, clothes etc.”
<div n="NI"/>Vāmana humbly said to Dhundhu “Oh Lord! I do
not want any wealth. It is my desire for wealth that
has brought me to this plight. I request you to give
me only three feet of ground.”
<div n="NI"/>As soon as the asura-King complied with his request,
Vāmana began to grow like the moon. He assumed the
[Page825-a+ 62]
shape of Trivikrama to measure each of the three
worlds with a foot. In two steps he measured all the
worlds. Vāmana whose body was bigger than Mahā-
meru became angry when he did not see place to
measure the third step, and fell on Dhundhu. By this
heavy fall there appeared a great cavity thirty thousand
yojanas deep. Bhagavān Viṣṇu took the asura Dhundhu
and threw him into that deep pit with a mighty force,
and by a shower of dust he filled the cavity.
<div n="NI"/>Indra with the Devas occupied the world of Gods.
Leaving the asura King in the sea of dust, Bhagavān
jumped into the river Kālindī and disappeared. (Padma
Purāṇa, Chapter 78).
