SURABHI II¦. A cow born from the ‘Huṃkāra’ (the
<div n="lb"/>sound ‘hum’) of Brahmā. As the cow grew up, milk
<div n="lb"/>began dripping down on earth from its udder and
<div n="lb"/>gradually it formed into the Kṣīrasāgara (ocean of
<div n="lb"/>milk). Four daughters, Surūpā, Haṃsikā, Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>and Sarvakāmadhuk were born to Surabhi and they
<div n="lb"/>are considered to be protectors of the four regions.
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi lives in the seventh world beneath the earth i.e.
<div n="lb"/>Rasātala. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 100).
