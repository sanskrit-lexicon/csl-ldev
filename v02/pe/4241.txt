MĀLAVĪ¦. The queen of Aśvapati king of Madra. She
was the mother of Sāvitrī. Aśvapati begot of Mālavī
a hundred sons called Mālavas.
<div n="NI"/>Yama took to Kālapurī the soul of Satyavān who was
shortlived. Sāvitrī, wife of Satyavān, followed Yama.
Yama blessed Sāvitrī and said she would have many
children and gave life to Satyavān again. Yama said
“Satyavān will live for four hundred years and you will
get a hundred sons of him. Your father Aśvapati also
will get a hundred sons of Mālavī and the earth will
get the name of Sāvitrī also”. Accordingly Mālavī got
a hundred sons and they were called Mālavas. (Chapter
297, Vana Parva).
