BĀṆA III¦. A warrior of Subrahmaṇya. Mention is
<div n="lb"/>made about this Bāṇa in Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 45, Stanza 67.
<div n="NI"/>BĀṆA IV. An asura. During the regime of Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>this Asura fought against the King and his brothers. A
<div n="lb"/>Śivaliṅga had been consecrated in the throat of this
[Page107-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>asura. So it was not possible for Lakṣmaṇa to defeat
<div n="lb"/>him though he had fought with him for so many days.
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa heard an etherial voice saying, “Unless and
<div n="lb"/>until the image of Śivaliṅga is removed from his throat
<div n="lb"/>Bāṇa could not be killed.” By the operation of arrows
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa smashed the image of Śivaliṅga in his
<div n="lb"/>throat. With the same arrow he cut the throat of the
<div n="lb"/>asura also and thus Bāṇa was killed. (Kampa Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa).
