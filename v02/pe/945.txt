BARHIṢAD¦(S). A class of Manes. It is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20 that some classes of manes
<div n="lb"/>such as Agniṣvāttas, Barhiṣads, Anagnis, and Sāgnis are
<div n="lb"/>said to have derived from Brahmā. Brahmā created two
<div n="lb"/>different sets of Pitṛs, Agniṣvāttas and Barhiṣads.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 10, Aṃśam 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>These Barhiṣads who are members of the Yamasabhā (coun-
<div n="lb"/>cil of the God of Death) perform the māntric rites for
<div n="lb"/>the dead. The name brings into its fold the world of
<div n="lb"/>the seven sacred sages also. (Chapter 208, Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.). It was through these Barhiṣads that Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>taught Sātvatadharma to a brahmin who became well-
<div n="lb"/>known later as Jyeṣṭha. (Chapter 34, Śloka 45, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Manusmṛti states that the Barhiṣads are the sons of the
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi Atri and the Pitṛs of all the Daityas, Dānavas,
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas, Gandharvas, Uragas, Rākṣasas, Suvarṇas and
<div n="lb"/>Kinnaras.
