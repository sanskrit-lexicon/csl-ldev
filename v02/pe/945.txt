BARHIṢAD¦(S). A class of Manes. It is mentioned in
Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20 that some classes of manes
such as Agniṣvāttas, Barhiṣads, Anagnis, and Sāgnis are
said to have derived from Brahmā. Brahmā created two
different sets of Pitṛs, Agniṣvāttas and Barhiṣads.
(Chapter 10, Aṃśam 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>These Barhiṣads who are members of the Yamasabhā (coun-
cil of the God of Death) perform the māntric rites for
the dead. The name brings into its fold the world of
the seven sacred sages also. (Chapter 208, Śānti Parva,
M.B.). It was through these Barhiṣads that Brahmā
taught Sātvatadharma to a brahmin who became well-
known later as Jyeṣṭha. (Chapter 34, Śloka 45, Śānti
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Manusmṛti states that the Barhiṣads are the sons of the
Maharṣi Atri and the Pitṛs of all the Daityas, Dānavas,
Yakṣas, Gandharvas, Uragas, Rākṣasas, Suvarṇas and
Kinnaras.
