ḌIBHAKA¦. A prince who, puffed up by the power of
<div n="lb"/>boons and blessings from the gods, tried to harm sage
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas. Balabhadrarāma killed him. The following
<div n="lb"/>account occurs in the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmadatta, King of Sālva, had two wives. No chil-
<div n="lb"/>dren were born to them for several years. Brahmadatta's
<div n="lb"/>minister, Mitrasaha, also had no children. Mitrasaha
<div n="lb"/>was a brahmin and a scholar. On his advice, Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>datta, with his wives, went to Kailāsa and performed
<div n="lb"/>tapas to please Śiva to get children. As a result of ten
<div n="lb"/>years’ rigorous tapas Śiva was pleased and blessed
<div n="lb"/>him that two sons would be born to him. Later his
<div n="lb"/>wives gave birth to two sons. The son of the eldest
<div n="lb"/>queen was named Haṃsa and that of the second queen
<div n="lb"/>was named Ḍibhaka. At this time a son was also born
<div n="lb"/>to Mitrasaha, the minister by the blessing of Viṣṇu. That
<div n="lb"/>child was named Janārdana.
<div n="NI"/>Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka were spoilt, but Janārdana was
<div n="lb"/>a bhakta of Viṣṇu. Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka performed
<div n="lb"/>tapas in their childhood to please Śiva and got invinci-
<div n="lb"/>ble power and arrows. After that they became loka-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇṭakas (torturers) and went round the world. Once
<div n="lb"/>they went to Kaśyapa's āśrama and destroyed the place
<div n="lb"/>of worship. After that they went to the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas. There they tortured the sages and made the
<div n="lb"/>sages naked who were wearing only loin cloth. Then
<div n="lb"/>they returned.
<div n="NI"/>Enraged by these, sage Durvāsas went to Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>taking the destroyed loin-cloth and other articles. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and his courtiers stood up and saluted him when
<div n="lb"/>they saw Durvāsas coming like saṃhārarudra. On
<div n="lb"/>hearing the news, Śrī Kṛṣṇa assured him that he would
<div n="lb"/>kill Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka and sent him back pacified.
<div n="NI"/>Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka began a rājasūya. They sent
<div n="lb"/>Janārdana to Śrī Kṛṣṇa with the message that he should
[Page241-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>either fight with them or give them tribute (in the
<div n="lb"/>form of money). Janārdana went to Dvārakā, just as
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra, a devotee of Viṣṇu, went to Ambāḍi with the
<div n="lb"/>message of Kaṃsa. Immediately Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
<div n="lb"/>with the chief Ministers like Sātyaki went to Sālva. In
<div n="lb"/>the war that followed Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Haṃsa and Bala.
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrarāma killed Ḍibhaka. (M.B. Bhaviṣya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 103-129).
