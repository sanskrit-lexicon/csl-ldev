<div n="NI"/>JANAMEJAYA I. A famous King of the Solar dynasty

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth, marriage and accession to throne.%} Janamejaya
was the son of Parīkṣit by his wife Madravatī. Vapu-
ṣṭamā, daughter of Suvarṇavarman, King of Kāśī was
Janamejaya's wife. Two sons, Śatānīka and Śaṅku-
karṇa were born to them. Janamejaya had three
brothers called Śrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena.
(Devī Bhāgavata, 2nd Skandha; Ādi Parva, Chapters
3 and 95).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Death of his father.%} Janamejaya's father, Parīkṣit
ruled the country in a very distinguished manner for
sixty years. While once hunting in the forest Parīkṣit
became very tired and thirsty. While searching for
water he came across a Sage named Śamīka and asked
him for some water. Śamīka being engaged in medita-
tion did not hear the King's request. But, the
[Page346-a+ 65]
King mistaking the sage's silence for haughtiness threw
in anger a dead snake round his neck and went away.
But, within seven days of the incident Parīkṣit was
bitten to death by Takṣaka, king of the Nāgas accord-
ing to the curse pronounced on him by Gavijāta,
son of sage Śamīka.
<div n="NI"/>Janamejaya was only an infant at the time of his
father's death. So the obsequies of the late king were
performed by his ministers. After that at an auspicious
time Janamejaya was crowned King. Within a short
time he mastered statecraft. Dhanurvidyā was taught
by Kṛpācārya. Very soon he earned reputation as an
efficient administrator. He got married in due course.
(Devī Bhāgavata, 2nd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%His hatred towards snakes.%} In the course of a talk
one day with Janamejaya Uttaṅka the sage detailed to
him the circumstances of his father's death. Only
then did he understand the actual cause of Parīkṣit's
death, and the information kindled in him intense
feelings of revenge not only against serpents but also
against the whole serpent dynasty. (Devī Bhāgavata,
2nd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Sarpasatra. (Serpent yajña).%} Janamejaya sought
the advice of priests and Ṛtviks as to how best revenge
could be taken against the serpents, and they advised
him to perform the great Yajña called Sarpasatra.
And, accordingly all necessary arrangements for the
Satra were made, and the King began dīkṣā (Initiation)
for it (to live for a few days under severe routine to
prepare the author of the yajña for it). But the priest
who made the arrangements looked into signs about the
successful conclusion of the yajña and opined that it
would be obstructed by a brahmin, and, the King,
therefore, ordered strict steps to be taken against the
entry of strangers into the Yāgaśālā.
<div n="NI"/>And, the Sarpasatra began. High priests wore black
clothes, and chanting mantras they made offerings in
the sacred fire, and this created a burning sensation in
the hearts of serpents. They began, one after another
to come and fall into the fire. All varieties of serpents
got consumed by the fire thus.
<div n="NI"/>Sages like Uttaṅka, Caṇḍabhārgava, Śārṅgarava, Vyāsa,
Uddālaka, Ātreya, Pramataka, Śvetaketu, Nārada,
Devala, Kālaghaṭa, Śrutaśravas, Kohala, Devaśarman,
Maudgalya and Samasaurabha acted as Ṛtviks at the
Satra. Though almost all the serpents courted death in
the fire, Takṣaka alone did not come. Fear-stricken he
had taken refuge with Indra.
<div n="NI"/>As the chanting of mantras increased in intensity and
volume Vāsuki began to feel the burning sensation. He
requested his sister Jaratkāru to find out some means
of escape from the Satra, and at the instance of Jarat-
kāru her son Āstīka set out for the palace of Janame-
jaya to obstruct the Yajña.
<div n="NI"/>Though the Ṛtviks invoked for a long time Takṣaka did
not appear. Enraged at his absence, Uttaṅka searched
for Takṣaka with his divine eyes and found him seated
on the throne of Indra along with him, who had given
him (Takṣaka) asylum. This challenge of Indra kindled
the wrath of Uttaṅka all the more, and he invoked
Indra, Takṣaka and Indra's throne too so that all of
them might together come and fall into the fire. And,
lo! there came the whole lot of them. Only two minutes
more and all of them would be reduced to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>By now Āstīka, the son of Jaratkāru had arrived at the
[Page346-b+ 64]
Yajña śālā. Janamejaya received the young Sage with
all respect and promised to grant his desire what-
ever that be. Āstīka's demand was that the Sarpa Satra
should be stopped. Though Janamejaya was not for
stopping the yajña, he was reminded of his promise to
grant any desire of Āstīka and the latter insisted on the
stopping of the Satra. Janamejaya stopped it. Āstīka
blessed that the serpents which had died at the Satra
would attain salvation. (Ādi Parva, Chapters 52-58;
Devī Bhāgavata, 2nd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Listens to the Bhārata story.%} While the Sarpa Śatra
was being conducted Vyāsa came over there and related
the whole story of the Mahābhārata at the request of
Janamejaya. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 60).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Saramā's curse.%} Janamejaya along with his brother
once performed a yajña of long duration at Kurukṣetra.
While the yajña was going on, a dog (son of Saramā
the bitch of the Devas) came there. The three brothers
of Janamejaya beat the dog which returned to its
mother, Saramā, crying. The mother asked him whe-
ther he had done anything to deserve the beating, and
he answered thus: “No, mother, I had done nothing
wrong. I did not lick the havis, nor did I even look at
it.” Hearing her son's reply Saramā in deep anguish,
went to Kurukṣetra and questioned Janamejaya as to
why her innocent son was beaten by his brothers. Nei-
ther he nor his brothers replied to Saramā, and she
cursed Janamejaya that he would be subjected to
adṛṣṭaphala (unforeseen results). This curse upset
Janamejaya so much that after the Sarpa Satra was
over and on his return to Hastināpura he made a search
for a Purohita (priest) competent enough to redeem
him from his sins, and at last he invited Somaśravas,
son of the great sage Śrutaśravas to be his Purohita, and
thus did Somaśravas become the priest of Janamejaya
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Successors of Janamejaya.%} Janamejaya had two sons,
Candrāpīḍa and Suryāpīḍa by his wife Kāśyā. Hundred
sons, experts in archery, were born to Candrāpīḍa. The
eldest of them, Satyakarṇa, ruled the country after Jana-
mejaya. Satyakarṇa had a son called Śvetakarṇa to
whom was born a son called Ajapārśva by his wife
Yādavī, the daughter of Sucāru. (Bhaviṣya Parva,
Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other Information%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Janamejaya defeated the King of Takṣaśilā and sub-
jugated the country. Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The Sage called Veda was the preceptor of Jana-
mejaya. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 82).
<div n="NI"/>(3) After the Sarpa Satra, Janamejaya performed an
Aśvamedha yajña at which Vyāsa delivered a lengthy
discourse on life and salvation. As Janamejaya said
that if he were to believe the words of Vyāsa his dead
father Parīkṣit should be shown to him. Vyāsa brought
Parīkṣit down from Svarga and showed him to his son.
On the occasion were also present sage Śamīka and
his son Śṛṅgī. (Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 35)
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Life time of Janamejaya.%} The great war at Kuru-
kṣetra was fought in 3138 B.C. (See under Mahābhārata)
After the war was over the Pāṇḍavas ruled the country
for 36 years. Vyāsa took three years to compose the
Mahābhārata. According to the Mahāprasthānika Parva
the Pāṇḍavas set out for the forest after handing over
the government to Parīkṣit, who ruled the country for
[Page347-a+ 65]
sixty years. From the above facts it becomes evident
that Janamejaya became king in 3042 B.C.
