MĀGHA¦. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th Century
<div n="lb"/>A.D. The only work of his which has come to light is
<div n="lb"/>Śiśupālavadha known popularly as Māgha.
<Poem>Upamā Kālidāsasya
<div n="lb"/>Bhāraverarthagauravam /
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍinaḥ padalālityaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Māghe santi trayo guṇāḥ //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>This is a very famous verse meaning thus: “The simile
<div n="lb"/>of Kālidāsa, the depth of meaning of the words of
<div n="lb"/>Bhāravi and the simplicity of language of Daṇḍin are all
<div n="lb"/>present in Māgha”. This indicates how great a poet
<div n="lb"/>Māgha was.
<div n="NI"/>From the last part of this Kāvya it can be surmised
<div n="lb"/>that Māgha was the son of Dattaka and grandson of
<div n="lb"/>Suprabhadeva. Suprabhadeva was the minister of a King
[Page461-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>called Dharmadeva. Māgha was born in Gujarat. A
<div n="lb"/>literary critic named Jacobi fixes the period of Māgha
<div n="lb"/>as the 6th century A.D. while others fix it as the 8th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D Māgha has made references to the drama
<div n="lb"/>‘Nāgānanda’ written by Harṣa. Harṣa was a King
<div n="lb"/>during the period 606 to 649 and that is why the
<div n="lb"/>period of Māgha is fixed after that period.
