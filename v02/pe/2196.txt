DURVĀSAS¦
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} A sage, who used to lose his temper
<div n="lb"/>very easily. He is believed to have been born from an
<div n="lb"/>aṃśa (part, aspect) of Śiva.
[Page256-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Three different stories are told in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas relating to his birth.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once a quarrel, arose between Brahmā and Śiva
<div n="lb"/>which developed into fighting, At the sight of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>seething with rage the Devas ran off frightened, and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī also got frightened. She told him ‘Durvāsam
<div n="lb"/>bhavati me’. (It has become impossible for me to live
<div n="lb"/>happily with you). Realising that it was his momentary
<div n="lb"/>anger which made life miserable for Pārvatī Śiva
<div n="lb"/>decided to transfer that trait of his character to some-
<div n="lb"/>one else.
<div n="NI"/>The incident took place during the life period of
<div n="lb"/>Śīlavatī, who was very much reputed for her chastity.
<div n="lb"/>While Śīlavatī was carrying her husband Ugraśravas
<div n="lb"/>(who though a leper yet desired to visit brothels) to
<div n="lb"/>the house of a prostitute the muni Aṇumāṇḍavya
<div n="lb"/>cursed Ugraśravas to die before sunrise the next day
<div n="lb"/>with his head broken. (See under Aṇumāṇḍavya).
<div n="lb"/>Śīlavatī made the counter curse, let not the sun rise the
<div n="lb"/>next day, to the muni's curse. Accordingly the sun did
<div n="lb"/>not rise the next day, and confusion prevailed every-
<div n="lb"/>where, whereupon the Trimūrtis and the Devas, through
<div n="lb"/>Anasūyā, the wife of Atrimaharṣi, got the curse of
<div n="lb"/>Śīlavatī withdrawn. Pleased at this the Trimūrtis
<div n="lb"/>asked Anasūyā to choose any boon she desired, and she
<div n="lb"/>prayed that Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara take their
<div n="lb"/>partial incarnations through her. Accordingly Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>as Candra and Mahāviṣṇu as Dattātreya were born as
<div n="lb"/>sons of Anasūyā. And, Śiva deposited his anger, which
<div n="lb"/>had caused unhappiness to Pārvatī, in Anasūyā. The
<div n="lb"/>child born out of that aspect of Śiva to Anasūyā was
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas. The name Durvāsas was very apt as the
<div n="lb"/>child was born out of the anger of Śiva which had
<div n="lb"/>made life miserable (durvāsa) for Pārvatī. (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once defeated in his fight with Brahmā Śiva took
<div n="lb"/>refuge with the Naranārāyaṇas who were doing penance
<div n="lb"/>in the plains of the Himālayas. Śiva told sage
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa everything about his plight and he asked the
<div n="lb"/>former to pierce his left hand with the Śūla. Śiva did
<div n="lb"/>so and three streams of blood flowed out of the wound
<div n="lb"/>made on the hand of the Ṛṣi, one stream towards the
<div n="lb"/>sphere of the stars, another into the skull in Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>hand and from the third stream Durvāsas was born.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, who witnessed this miracle withdrew from
<div n="lb"/>war and returned to his abode. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(3) In the fierce fight with the Tripuras Śiva, in great
<div n="lb"/>rage, ultimately shot an arrow against them, and that
<div n="lb"/>arrow, after killing the Tripuras, assumed the form of
<div n="lb"/>a child and returned to the lap of Śiva, and the child
<div n="lb"/>was named Durvāsas. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 160, Verses 14, 15).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kuntī granted boon.%} Once while Kuntī was living in
<div n="lb"/>the palace of Kuntibhoja Durvāsas came there, and
<div n="lb"/>pleased with Kuntī, he granted her five mantras. It
<div n="lb"/>was with the aid of those mantras that Kunti became
<div n="lb"/>mother of Karṇa and others. (For details see under
<div n="lb"/>Kunti Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa bathed in pāyasa (pudding).%} Once Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>came to Dvārakā where Kṛṣṇa and Rukminī looked
<div n="lb"/>after him to his heart's content. Though, at times he
<div n="lb"/>took only meagre food, at other times he destroyed
<div n="lb"/>everything he saw and created trouble. Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī served him according to schedule. One day
[Page257-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the sage asked Kṛṣṇa to cook some pudding and it was
<div n="lb"/>got ready. Then the sage asked Kṛṣṇa to smear his
<div n="lb"/>(Kṛṣṇa) body with pudding. Kṛṣṇa did so except on
<div n="lb"/>his feet. After that Durvāsas got down the chariot and
<div n="lb"/>making Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī serve as horses himself got
<div n="lb"/>into it and drove away in great speed into the forest.
<div n="lb"/>On the way he thrashed the ‘horses’ one ofter the
<div n="lb"/>other. Neither Kṛṣṇa nor Rukmiṇī felt sorry about this
<div n="lb"/>action of the sage. On reaching the forest he halted
<div n="lb"/>the chariot and blessed Śrī Kṛṣṇa that arrows would
<div n="lb"/>not hit the parts of Kṛṣṇa's body which were smeared
<div n="lb"/>with the pāyasa. The spot at which the sage blessed
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa became famous as Varadānatīrtha in after years.
<div n="lb"/>It may be noted that Kṛṣṇa died by an arrow hitting
<div n="lb"/>his foot which was not smeared with the pāyasa. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 160).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Conducted yajña for Śvetaki.%} There once was a King
<div n="lb"/>called Śvetaki equal to Indra. He conducted a yajña
<div n="lb"/>of a hundred years' duration. Innumerable brahmins
<div n="lb"/>were engaged in the successful conduct of the yajña.
<div n="lb"/>Some years after the yajña began the brahmins went
<div n="lb"/>their own way leaving it unfinished as the clouds of
<div n="lb"/>fume all the twentyfour hours in the yajñaśālā irked
<div n="lb"/>and affected their eyes. When Śvetaki requested them
<div n="lb"/>to further cooperate to complete the yajña they
<div n="lb"/>insultingly asked him to invite Śūdras for it. Then
<div n="lb"/>the King went to the Himālayas and did tapas for
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, who at last deputed Durvāsas to complete the
<div n="lb"/>yajña, and under the maharṣi's aegis it was completed
<div n="lb"/>within twelve years. On account of the constant offe-
<div n="lb"/>rings of havis in Agni (fire) during the period Agni
<div n="lb"/>fell a prey to indigestion, which was cured only after
<div n="lb"/>it ate up the Khāṇḍava forest. (See Khāṇḍava dahana).
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 235).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Mudgala granted salvation.%} Once Durvāsas went to
<div n="lb"/>sage Mudgala who was doing tapas in Kurukṣetra
<div n="lb"/>taking food only rarely and demanded some food with
<div n="lb"/>the object of testing his dharmavṛtti (righteousness).
<div n="lb"/>The sage gave Durvāsas all the food he had with him,
<div n="lb"/>himself starving, and Durvāsas left the āśrama after
<div n="lb"/>eating a part of the food and smearing his body with
<div n="lb"/>the rest of it. This process was repeated by Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>for six days, but Mudgala never felt or showed any
<div n="lb"/>offence. Greatly pleased at the firm righteousness of
<div n="lb"/>the King. Durvāsas blessed him to bodily ascend to
<div n="lb"/>heaven. Immediately a vimāna (aeroplane) descended
<div n="lb"/>from Viṣṇuloka and carried Mudgala in it to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 260).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other information.%} (1) Durvāsas ran away in fear of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas. (See under Duryodhana, Para 12).
<div n="NI"/>(2) He suffered at the hands of Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Ḍibhaka).
<div n="NI"/>(3) He advised Śaivapañcākṣara to the woman called
<div n="lb"/>Kalāvatī. (See under Kalāvatī).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Durvāsas and Kṣīrābdhi-mathanam. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Amṛtam).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Durvāsas and Dakṣayajña. (See under Dakṣa).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Terrified Durvāsas ran helter-skelter in the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds. (See under Aṃbarīṣa, Para 3).
<div n="NI"/>(7) He was responsible for the death of Lakṣmaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(See Lakṣmaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(8) He cursed Śakuntalā. (See Śakuntalā).
<div n="NI"/>(9) He spent his time in Indra's assembly. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 23: For another story
<div n="lb"/>see under Pitṛtīrtha).
