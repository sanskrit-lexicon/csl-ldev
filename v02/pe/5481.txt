PUṆYA¦ I Son of the sage Dīrghatamas. The story of
<div n="lb"/>Puṇya as found in Jñānavāsiṣṭha is the following:—
<div n="lb"/>There is a mountain called Mahendra in Jambūdvīpa.
<div n="lb"/>Dīrghatamas who was doing penance there had two
<div n="lb"/>sons named Puṇya and Pāvana. Puṇyakumāra grew
<div n="lb"/>up into a boy abounding in virtues. Pāvana was not
<div n="lb"/>so broad-minded. When after some time Dīrghatamas,
<div n="lb"/>their father died, Puṇyakumāra controlling his sorrow
<div n="lb"/>did all the funeral rites; but Pāvana unable to control
<div n="lb"/>his sorrow left the place and wandered in the forests weep-
<div n="lb"/>ing bitterly. After some days Puṇyakumāra went in
<div n="lb"/>search of his brother and on finding him consoled him
<div n="lb"/>and told him that there was nothing to be worried ab-
<div n="lb"/>out their father's death. On hearing the learned
<div n="lb"/>and moral teachings of Puṇya, Pāvana also got en-
<div n="lb"/>lightened and after living in that forest for a number of
<div n="lb"/>years both of them abandoned their lives.
