PUṆYA¦ I Son of the sage Dīrghatamas. The story of
Puṇya as found in Jñānavāsiṣṭha is the following:—
There is a mountain called Mahendra in Jambūdvīpa.
Dīrghatamas who was doing penance there had two
sons named Puṇya and Pāvana. Puṇyakumāra grew
up into a boy abounding in virtues. Pāvana was not
so broad-minded. When after some time Dīrghatamas,
their father died, Puṇyakumāra controlling his sorrow
did all the funeral rites; but Pāvana unable to control
his sorrow left the place and wandered in the forests weep-
ing bitterly. After some days Puṇyakumāra went in
search of his brother and on finding him consoled him
and told him that there was nothing to be worried ab-
out their father's death. On hearing the learned
and moral teachings of Puṇya, Pāvana also got en-
lightened and after living in that forest for a number of
years both of them abandoned their lives.
