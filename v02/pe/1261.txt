BRAHMAHATYĀ¦. Killing a Brāhmaṇa is called Brahma-
hatyā. In ancient India killing a Brāhmin was consi-
dered to be a great sin. He, who committed this sin
had to build a hut in the forest and live there for a
period of twelve years, or make an alms-pot called
‘Śivaśirodhvaja’ and wander about begging alms, to
purify his soul, or else to attempt to jump into a
blazing fire thrice with bowed head, or perform one
of the three sacrifices Aśvamedha, Svarjit or Gosava.
If none of these was possible, he had to give all the
wealth he had to Brāhmins well-versed in Vedas, as
gift. It is mentioned in Agnipurāṇa, Chapter 169, that
if any of the vows mentioned above was performed he
would be absolved from the sin of Brahmahatyā.
