BRAHMAHATYĀ¦. Killing a Brāhmaṇa is called Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>hatyā. In ancient India killing a Brāhmin was consi-
<div n="lb"/>dered to be a great sin. He, who committed this sin
<div n="lb"/>had to build a hut in the forest and live there for a
<div n="lb"/>period of twelve years, or make an alms-pot called
<div n="lb"/>‘Śivaśirodhvaja’ and wander about begging alms, to
<div n="lb"/>purify his soul, or else to attempt to jump into a
<div n="lb"/>blazing fire thrice with bowed head, or perform one
<div n="lb"/>of the three sacrifices Aśvamedha, Svarjit or Gosava.
<div n="lb"/>If none of these was possible, he had to give all the
<div n="lb"/>wealth he had to Brāhmins well-versed in Vedas, as
<div n="lb"/>gift. It is mentioned in Agnipurāṇa, Chapter 169, that
<div n="lb"/>if any of the vows mentioned above was performed he
<div n="lb"/>would be absolved from the sin of Brahmahatyā.
