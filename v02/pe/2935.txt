JAYA¦ XI. (JAYAVIJAYAS). They were gate-keepers of
Vaikuṇṭha. As these two sons of devas were engaged
in the service of Mahāviṣṇu guarding the gate, the
hermits Sanaka and others came to see Mahāviṣṇu to
pay him homage. Jaya and Vijaya stopped them at the
gate. Sanaka got angry and cursed them to take three
births on the earth as Asuras (demons). The sorrow-
ful Jaya and Vijaya requested for absolution from the
curse. The hermit said that they had to take three
births as Asuras and that they would be redeemed by the
weapon of Mahāviṣṇu. Accordingly Jaya and Vijaya
were born in the earth as Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyaka-
śipu. They were killed by Mahāviṣṇu. In the second
birth they were Rāvaṇa and Kuṃbhakarṇa. Mahā-
viṣṇu incarnated as Śrī Rāma killed them. In the third
birth they were Śiśupāla and Dantavaktra. They were
killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, an incarnation of Bhagavān Viṣṇu.
For further details see under Hiraṇyākṣa. Hiraṇyaka-
śipu, Rāvaṇa; Kuṃbhakarṇa, Śiśupāla and Dantavak-
tra. After three births Jaya and Vijaya returned to
Vaikuṇṭha. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
