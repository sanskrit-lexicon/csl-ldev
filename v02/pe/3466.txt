KERALA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A small country lying in the
south-west corner of India. From the Purāṇas it
could be understood that this country lying to the
south of Gokarṇa upto Cape Comorin and to the
[Page403-b+ 65]
west of Western Ghats had a very ancient history and
civilization of its own.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of Kerala.%} There are two statements, slightly
different from each other, in the Purāṇas, about the
origin of Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>(1) For performing the funeral ceremony of the sons
of Sagara whose ashes were lying in Pātāla (Nether
world), Bhagīratha performed penance and brought
the heavenly river Gaṅgā to the earth. (See under
Gaṅgā). The river fell in North India and flowed in
torrents to the sea and the surrounding regions were
submerged in water. Among the places submerged,
there was the important holy place and Bath of
Gokarṇa also, lying on the west coast of India. Those
hermits who lived in the vicinity of the temple at
Gokarṇa, escaped from the flood and went to Mahendra-
giri and informed Paraśurāma of the calamity of the
flood. Paraśurāma went with them to the sea-shore.
Varuṇa did not make his appearance. The angry
Paraśurāma stood in deep meditation for a little
while. The weapons came to his hands. Varuṇa was
filled with fear and he instantly appeared before
Paraśurāma, who asked him to release the land
swallowed by the sea. Varuṇa agreed. Paraśurāma
sent his bow and arrow back to the sky. Then he took
a winnowing basket (Śūrpa) and threw it at the sea.
The sea retreated from the place up to the spot where
the winnowing basket fell, and the portion of land
including Gokarṇa which had been swallowed by sea was
recovered. This land is called Kerala, which is known
by the name ‘Śūrpāraka’ also. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chapters 98 and 99).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Paraśurāma went round the world eighteen
times and killed all the Kṣatriya Kings. After that he
performed the sacrifice of Aśvamedha (horse sacrifice).
In the sacrifice he gave all the lands as alms to
Brahmins. Kaśyapa received all the lands for the
Brahmins. After that he requested Paraśurāma to
vacate the land. Accordingly Paraśurāma created
new land by shooting an arrow at the sea, for
his own use. “At the words of Kaśyapa, he made the
sea retreat by shooting an arrow, thereby creating dry
land.” This land was Kerala. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
Chapter 70).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kerala and Pātāla (Nether world).%} The ancient
sages of the Purāṇas have grouped the worlds into
three, the Svarga (heaven), Bhūmi (the earth) and
the Pātāla (the nether world). The three worlds taken
as a whole were divided into fourteen worlds. It does
not appear that this grouping was merely imaginary.
A keen observation of the Purāṇas would lead one to
infer that the Himālayan plateau was considered as
Devaloka-Svarga (heaven), the planes between the
Himālaya and the Vindhya as Bhūloka (the earth)
and the regions to the south of the Vindhya as Pātāla
(the nether world), by the ancient people of India.
The seven worlds of Pātāla such as Atala, Vitala,
Sutala, Talātala, Mahātala, Rasātala and Pātāla might
have been seven countries in this region. The following
description which occurs in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8,
would substantiate this inference.
<div n="NI"/>“Pātāla is below the earth. This Pātāla is a group of
seven worlds one below the other, with names, Atala,
Vitala, Sutala, Talātala, Rasātala and Mahātala. In
all those worlds, there are several beautiful cities and
[Page404-a+ 65]
houses, palaces and castles, parks, gardens, open temples
and halls, natural arbours etc. made by Maya. There
live the Asuras, the Dānavas (a class of Asuras-demons)
the nāgas (serpents) and others, with their families,
with happiness and comfort. Chirping birds, pigeons,
parrots, docile parrots etc. always play there with their
inseparable mates. Trees bearing sweet fruits, plants
covered with fragrant flowers, arbours with creepers
growing thick, beautiful houses floored with white
marble, and so many other things giving pleasure and
comfort are seen there in plenty. In these things the
Pātāla surpasses heaven. Daityas, Dānavas and the
Nāgas (the Asuras and the serpents) are the dwellers
of these worlds. They lead a happy and pleasant life with
their families enjoying all sorts of comfort and luxury.”
Pātāla, one of the seven divisions of the world is describ-
ed as follows:
<div n="NI"/>“This is the region of the Nāgas (the serpents). At the
root-place of this region there is a particular place
having an area of thirty thousand yojanas. Viṣṇu Kalā
who has the attribute of ‘tāmasa’ (darkness) lives there
under the name ‘Ananta’. The real Ananta or Ādiśeṣa
is the radiant embodiment of this Kalā. The daughters
of the Nāga Kings are of fair complexion and very
beautiful, with clean body. They use perfumeries such
as sandalwood, aloewood, saffron, etc.”
<div n="NI"/>In this description, the words Daityas, Nāgas, Ananta,
Sandalwood, aloewood etc. and the mention of natural
beauty should be paid particular attention to. From
the Rāmāyaṇa we can understand that the Āryas refer-
red to the Drāviḍas as Asuras, Rākṣasas (Giants) etc.
History says that the Nāgas were the early inhabitants
of Kerala. The ancient word ‘Ananta’ denotes Tri-
vandrum (Tiru-Ananta-puram). The temple of Śrī
Padmanābha at Trivandrum answers to this descrip-
tion. The perfumeries such as sandalwood, aloewood
(cidar) etc. are the wealth of Kerala. On the whole the
description of Pātāla fits well with that of Kerala. So
it is not wrong to infer that the description of Pātāla
in the Purāṇas is entirely about Kerala in all its
aspects.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Primitiveness of Kerala.%} From the portions of
Purāṇas given below it could be ascertained that
Kerala had an independence of its own from the very
ancient days.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Among the Kings who attended the Svayaṃvara
(marriage) of Śaśikalā, the daughter of the King of
Kāśī, such as, the King of Kuru, King of Mādra, King
of Sindhu, King of Pāñcāla, Kings of Karṇāṭaka, Cola
and Vidarbha, there was the King of Kerala also. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 3).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When describing the various places in the Southern
part of Bhārata, names such as Dramiḍa, Kerala,
Mūṣika, Karṇāṭaka etc. occur in the Mahābhārata.
So it is to be understood that when Vyāsa wrote
Bhārata, there was the kingdom of Kerala and that it
was separate from the country of Drāviḍa. (M.B.
Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9).
<div n="NI"/>(3) “Kārtavīryārjuna took his majestic seat in the
midst of Cola, Kerala, Pāṇḍya and other Kings of the
countries under the sea, who were standing round him
to pay homage to him.” (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter
54).
<div n="NI"/>(4) It is mentioned in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 277, that
a King named Gāndhāra was born in the dynasty
[Page404-b+ 65]
of Turvasu the brother of Yadu, and that from Gān-
dhāra were born the powerful families of the Gāndhāras
the Keralas, the Colas, the Pāṇḍyas and the Kolas.
<div n="NI"/>(5) In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 175, it is
mentioned that the people of Kerala were considered as
barbarians by the North Indians.
<div n="NI"/>(6) In Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, it is mentioned that the
Kings of Cola, Pāṇḍya and Kerala, from South India,
had reached the capital city of Vidarbha to take part
in the Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Rukmiṇī.
<div n="NI"/>(7) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
Chapter 254, Stanza 15, that in his conquest of the
countries, Karṇa had conquered Kerala also.
<div n="NI"/>(8) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 31, that Sahadeva, one of the Pāṇḍavas, con-
quered the Keralas and the Kerakas. It may be noted
that the Kerakas are different from Keralas.
<div n="NI"/>(9) Vālmīki mentions the countries which could be
seen by the monkeys who were sent to the South by
Sugrīva to search for Sītā.
<Poem>Nadīṃ Godāvarīṃ caiva
Sarvamevānupaśyata /
Tathaivāndhrān ca Pauṇḍrān ca
Colān Pāṇḍyān ca Keralān. //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>“You could see the river Godāvarī and beyond it the
countries of Āndhra, Pauṇḍra, Cola, Pāṇḍya and
Kerala.”
<div n="NI"/>This is a proof of the primitiveness of Kerala.
(10) The King of Kerala had given Yudhiṣṭhira, as
presents, sandalwood, pearls. Lapis Lazuli etc. (M.B.
Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 51).
In several other Purāṇas also, mention about Kerala
occurs.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The ancient administration of Kerala.%} Parimelazhakar,
a Saṅga poet who was a great expounder of “Tirukku-
ral”, has stated that from the beginning of the world
the three kingdoms, Cera, Cola and Pāṇḍya had existed.
Though there is a bit of exaggeration in this statement,
there are enough proofs to say that a long time before
the birth of Christ, Kerala was under a systematic rule.
In ‘Tolkāppiyam’ the first grammatical work in Tamil
mention is made about the administration of Kerala.
Megasthenes, a traveller of 4th century B.C. has stated
about the rule of Kerala:
<div n="NI"/>There were five councils called the Pañcamahāsabhās
(the five great councils) to help the Cera Kings.
It is stated that these councils were formed by the King
Utiyan Cera of the Tṛkkaṇā fort. Besides these five
councils there was an advisory Committee, of which, the
priest of the King, the Chief Minister, Chief of the spies
and the Chief Revenue officer (Kāviṭi) were members.
For convenience of administration the country was
divided into tarakkūṭṭas (groups of houses—villages) and
and Nāṭṭukkūṭṭas (Districts—group of villages). Taras
(villages) were ruled by four elders (Kāraṇavas). Four
villages formed a Nālpāḍu (group) of four. Four Nāl-
pādus formed a Kazhaka (a division of the country with
a chief temple within it) and four Kazhakas formed a
Peruṃkazhaka (greater Kazhaka). Peruṃkazhaka was
also known as Tṛkkala. The assembly hall of tṛk-
kūṭṭa is called Koṭṭil. This hall was erected generally
beside the temple. The chief officer of the temple
was the chairman of the tṛkkūṭṭa (assembly of
the people). When a tṛkkūṭṭa is assembled, sixty-four
elders of the “taras”, the “accas” (officers) of Kazhakas,
[Page405-a+ 65]
the sixty-four Taṇḍāns and sixteen Nālpādies had to be
present. The Nālpādies were the chiefs of four taras.
The accas, who were the Presidents, had to come clad
in variegated silk, with waist-band of long cloth and
wearing a small sword (Churikā). Till recently the
Kazhakas of Aṇḍallūr, Rāmpallya, Kurvantaṭṭa, Turutti
etc., and so many Nālpādus and taras and the elders
thereof had been retaining and enjoying titles and
distinctions of rank.
<div n="NI"/>The Namboothiris (Brahmins) entered Kerala before
the beginning of the Malayāla Era. With that, changes
took place in the administration of Kerala. Certain
edicts help us to ascertain the changes that took place
in the administration. The edict of Vāzhappally of the
9th century by Rājaśekhara is an important one in
this connection. This emperor of the Ceras who is consi-
dered to be a contemporary of Śrī Śaṅkarācārya had
the title beginning with “Rājādhirāja Parameśvara
Bhaṭṭāraka”. (T.A.S. Vol. II, P. 8-14). The subject
dealt with in the edict is the ‘daily worship and settle-
ment’, in the temple of Tiruvoṭṭiyūr. It is stated in this
edict that the people of Vāzhappally and the representa-
tives of 18 Nādus or divisions had met in the temple
and taken certain decisions.
<div n="NI"/>The next one is the Kottayam Copper edicts known as
the ‘Tarisa Church Edicts.’ This is a document granting
the Tarisa Church in Quilon, the adjoining lands and
some other institutions. This edict was granted by
Ayyanaṭi tiruvaṭikal the ruler of the Nāṭu (division),
for the Cera emperor. It is mentioned as “including
the Temple Officer Vijayarākatevar”, which means
that Vijayarāka had been present on the occasion of
granting the edict, as the representative of Emperor
Sthāṇuravi. The Nāḍuvāzhis (local chiefs or rulers of
division) were not empowered to take decision in very
important matters. Titles, rights distinctions of rank
etc. were granted by a council of Chief minister,
Officers, Punnattalappati and Polakkūṭippati (two
high officials). Vijayarākatevar, the Koil adhikāri,
was the representative of the emperor at Mahodaya-
pura. The supervising officials of temples were gene-
rally called the ‘Koil adhikāri’. Normally-the younger
brothers of the Kings were appointed in this rank.
These temple-officers were helped in their duties by
the Division-rulers, people of the locality and the in-
ferior officers in the temple. When the empire of
Kulaśekhara declined, the family of Perumpaḍappu
got this position of ‘Koil adhikāri’. So the title ‘Koil
adhikāri’ is added to the names of the princes of
Cochin.
<div n="NI"/>Another one is the Mampally Edicts. This is a deed of
granting some lands free to the temple of Airūr, in the
name of Ādiccan Umayamma of Tṛkkalayapuram, by
Veṇāṭṭu Śrī Vallabhankota in M.E. 149. Even such
an unimportant thing as the granting of free lands,
had to be effected with the permission of Cera kings
and their councils. (T.A.S. Vol IV, Page 9).
<div n="NI"/>From these edicts it is clear that the administration of
the temples was carried out by representatives elected
by people. For each village temple there was an
administrative council. These councils were controlled
by Nāduvāzhis and Deśavāzhis (Divisional and Sub
Divisional rulers who had Nair infantry (big or small
as the case may be) at their disposal. The adminis-
trative assembly met either in the open hall at the main
[Page405-b+ 65]
gate of the temple or on the stage for performances.
The rights and authorities were in the hands of the
general assembly of the people called Nāṭṭukkūṭṭa and
the council of the temple officials. When the Namboothi-
ris became powerful they became members of the
council. With this change the Kings and Koil adhikāris
became puppets in the hands of the Namboothiris. In
the Rāmeśvaram edict of M.E. 278 it is mentioned that
King Rāmavarma Kulaśekhara was punished with
retribution for his ‘hatred’ of the Āryas. Finally the
Nambūthiris (Malayāla Brahmins) became the land-
lords of the country.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The people af ancient Kerala.%} It is assumed that the
ancient inhabitants of Kerala were Drāviḍas. But
some historians have mentioned about the ‘Proto
Dravidians and the Pre Dravidians. The hill tribes such
as Kāṇikkārs, Mutuvas, Mala Veṭas, Pulayas, Kura-
vas, Nāyāṭis, Malayarayas, Malayaṭis, Malap-
paṇḍāras, Malayūrālis, Mutuvans Pullāṭis etc. are
said to have belonged to this group. They worshipped
several things such as stone, banyan tree, elengi tree,
Asclepia tree, Nīm tree Terminatia Bellarica, Borassus
flabelliformis, cassia fistula, Ghosts, thunder, rain, the
sun etc. They worshipped good ghosts for welfare, and
bad ghosts to avoid misfortunes. They had images of
Māṭa, Cātta, Cāvu, Maruta, Pettucāvu, Arukula,
Preta, Vazhipiṇakki, Āyiramilli, Parakkuṭṭi, Kāttujāti,
Malavāzhi, Māriṇi, Nāyāṭṭu Pe Maṅkāṭṭamma,
Muniyappa, Veṭṭakkāran and so on. They worshipped
in small bushes, open grounds or houses. They knew
black magic such as cursing, giving poison in meals etc.
These uncivilized people were very particular about
cleanliness on the occasions of delivery, menstruātion,
death etc. They pleased bad ghosts by offering liquor,
flesh and blood, and good ghosts with milk, ghee, honey
etc. They buried dead bodies with a little raw rice
meant for food at the time of entering the other world.
They had collective worship. They sang songs at the
time of worship using some primitive musical instru-
ments. For each village there were elders who were
priests and rulers. They erected stone huts in the burial
place and buried the dead inside these in graves. These
graves were called ‘Pāṇḍukuzhy’. The Ūrālis, continue
the custom of posting two stones at either end of the
grave. The custom of burial prevailed more than
cremation.
<div n="NI"/>Nair, Nambūtiri, Īzhava, Christians, Muslims and such
other castes came to Kerala from other places later.
<div n="NI"/>7){%Ibn Batuta and Kerala.%} Ibn Batuta who was born in the
town of Ṭānjīr in Morocco in Africa in A.D. 1304 had
travelled all over the Eastern countries then known. He
had started from his house on a Haj Pilgrimage at the
age of 22. He returned home only after 29 years, having
travelled all over the known countries. He has written
a book in Arabic about his travels of 29 years. One third
of this thick volume is devoted for descriptions of his
travels in India alone. Its name is ‘Tuh Phattunannār’.
He passed over the Hindu Kush in A.D. 1333 and
entered India. In the midst of his travels throughout
the length and breadth of India, he came to Kerala
also. He says as follows about Kerala in his book:—
“Malabar is the country of Pepper. This country's
length from Gokarṇa to Quilon is two months’ journey.
All the roads in this country are rendered cool and shady
by asclapia trees. On the roads at intervals of half an
[Page406-a+ 64]
hour there are inns. Near the inn there will be a well
and a person to give water. The non-Muslims are given
water in pots. But water is poured into the hands of
Muslims. Rice is served in plantain leaf and sauces
are also served in the same leaf. Uncultivated and
uninhabited land is not to be seen. Each house is
situated in the centre of a cultivated area. The people
of this country do not use animals to carry goods.
Travelling is on foot Only Kings use horses. There is
a conveyance called mañcal (Palanquin). Slaves are
used as Palanquin bearers. I have seen roads which
could be used so fearlessly, only in Kerala and, no
where else in the world. Capital punishment is given to
one who steals even a coconut. The people of this
country respect Muslims.
<div n="NI"/>There are twelve kings in Malabar. None of them
are Muslims. Many of them are powerful having an
army of more than fifty-thousand soldiers. But there are
no quarrels or clashes among them. The powerful do
not have the desire to subjugate the less powerful. The
inheritants of these kings are not sons, but nephews
(sons of sisters). Besides the people of Kerala I have
seen only the Muslims of the country of Salam on the
banks of the Niger in Africa who have adopted the
system of inheritance in the female line.”
<div n="NI"/>Ibn Batuta has given some minor descriptions about
the towns of Maṅgalāpuram, Ezhumala, Kaṇṇūr
Calicut, Pāliyam, Crāṅganūr and Quilon.
