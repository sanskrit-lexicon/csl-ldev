ROHIṆĪ III¦. The mother of Balabhadrarāma.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Vasudeva had two wives Devakī
and Rohiṇī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was born from Devakī and
Balabhadrarāma from Rohiṇī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous Birth of Rohiṇī.%} Vasudeva was the rebirth
of Prajāpati Kaśyapa. When Kaśyapa took birth as
Vasudeva, his two wives Aditi and Surasā took birth as
Devakī and Rohiṇī respectively. (They took birth thus,
because of the curse of Varuṇa. For details of the
curse see under Kaśyapa, para 6).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The birth of Balabhadra.%} The seventh child of
Devakī was placed in the womb of Rohiṇī and Bala-
bhadrarāma was born. (For this story see under
Kṛṣṇa, para 6, Kaṃsa, para 6 and Ṣaḍarbhaka).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} As soon as a messenger named Dāruka
brought the news that the entire race of the Yādavas
had perished in Dvārakā,
<div n="NI"/>“because of grief, Vasudeva, Devakī and Rohiṇī forsook
their bodies.” (Bhāgavata, Skandha 11).
