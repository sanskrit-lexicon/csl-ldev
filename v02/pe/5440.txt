PṚTHURAŚMI¦. One of those who are named ‘Yati’.
The Yatis were a people of anti-yajña feelings and
were all burnt to death in Indra's fire of wrath. But
three yatis, Bṛhadgiri, Rayovāja and Pṛthuraśmi were
taken care of by Indra and Indra taught them Brahma-
vidyā, Kṣatriyavidyā and Vaiśyavidyā.
<div n="NI"/>Pṛthuraśmi compelled Indra to grant him Kṣātratejas
also along with Kṣātravidyā. There is now a sāma even
in the name of Pṛthuraśmi. (Pañca-viṃśa-Brāhmaṇa).
