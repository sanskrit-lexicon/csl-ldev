PṚTHURAŚMI¦. One of those who are named ‘Yati’.
<div n="lb"/>The Yatis were a people of anti-yajña feelings and
<div n="lb"/>were all burnt to death in Indra's fire of wrath. But
<div n="lb"/>three yatis, Bṛhadgiri, Rayovāja and Pṛthuraśmi were
<div n="lb"/>taken care of by Indra and Indra taught them Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>vidyā, Kṣatriyavidyā and Vaiśyavidyā.
<div n="NI"/>Pṛthuraśmi compelled Indra to grant him Kṣātratejas
<div n="lb"/>also along with Kṣātravidyā. There is now a sāma even
<div n="lb"/>in the name of Pṛthuraśmi. (Pañca-viṃśa-Brāhmaṇa).
