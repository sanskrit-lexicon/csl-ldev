PITṚTĪRTHA¦. The Kumbhīpākanaraka (the hell of
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhīpāka) in the land of the manes is called
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛtīrtha. There is a story about this in Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata:
<div n="NI"/>Once the sage Durvāsas with his body smeared with
<div n="lb"/>ashes and wearing sacred berries went to Pitṛloka mut-
<div n="lb"/>tering “Śivaśaṅkara sarvātman śrīmātar bhuvaneśvari”.
<div n="lb"/>The lord of the Pitṛloka received him with respect and
<div n="lb"/>worshipped him. While they were talking, Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>heard cries of agony from somewhere and the sage
<div n="lb"/>then asked Pitṛnātha thus: “Oh lord of the Pitṛs, I
<div n="lb"/>have heard you described as a very virtuous man. How
<div n="lb"/>can then such painful cries of distress be heard from
<div n="lb"/>here? “Oh, I am dying beaten”, “Oh, I am being killed”
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, I am dying” and “Oh, I am being burnt” are
<div n="lb"/>some of the woeful shrieks I hear. What is the reason
<div n="lb"/>for this?”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Dharmarāja said: “Great sage, this is in
<div n="lb"/>fact a land of virtue. Nothing but righteous things are
<div n="lb"/>done here. I can tell you from where you hear that
<div n="lb"/>wail. The Yamapurī named Saṃyamanī is nearby.
<div n="lb"/>There Yama sits to punish the sinners. Yama is a
<div n="lb"/>dispenser of Justice and he has got several cruel and
<div n="lb"/>mighty servants to carry out his orders. There are
<div n="lb"/>eighty-six hells to punish the sinners and of these Kum-
<div n="lb"/>bhīpāka is the most horrible. Great sinners like those
<div n="lb"/>who insult the gods, fornicators and those who insult
<div n="lb"/>their parents are put in this hell and punished. You
<div n="lb"/>are now hearing the cries of such sinners from that
<div n="lb"/>hell.”
<div n="NI"/>Durvāsas was curious to see the hell and the lord of
<div n="lb"/>the Manes gave permission and asked his servants to
<div n="lb"/>show Durvāsas the Kumbhīpākanaraka. The hell was
<div n="lb"/>found to change into a heaven. The residents were
<div n="lb"/>laughing, singing dancing and doing such acts of
<div n="lb"/>happiness.
<div n="NI"/>The servants of Yama were astonished and they went
<div n="lb"/>and reported to Yamarāja this sudden change. Yamarāja
<div n="lb"/>was also amazed to hear the news. He immediately
<div n="lb"/>rode on his vehicle, the buffalo, to the hell to learn the
<div n="lb"/>details personally. He could not find out the cause for
<div n="lb"/>the change. The place looked like the Svargaloka of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. King Yama sent a messenger to Indra with the
<div n="lb"/>news and Indra at first thought that it must be due to
[Page591-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>some māyā and so came to the place swiftly on
<div n="lb"/>his Airāvata. The news spread and one by one Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, the Aṣṭadikpālakas (the eight guardians of the
<div n="lb"/>quarters) and all such people came to Kumbhīpāka-
<div n="lb"/>naraka. Nobody could find an explanation for this
<div n="lb"/>change and so Mahāviṣṇu accompanied by a few devas
<div n="lb"/>went to Kailāsa and reported the matter to Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva said smilingly “Oh Viṣṇu, all this happened
<div n="lb"/>because of the greatness of the holy ashes. When the
<div n="lb"/>sage Durvāsas bent down to have a good look at the
<div n="lb"/>hell, particles of ashes from his body fell into the hell.
<div n="lb"/>From that moment onwards Kumbhīpākanaraka be-
<div n="lb"/>came a holy place for the Manes. This hell will hence-
<div n="lb"/>forth be known as Pitṛtīrtha and those pitṛs who bathe
<div n="lb"/>in the holy pond there will become virtuous people.
<div n="lb"/>Do install on the shore of this pond an idol of mine,
<div n="lb"/>a Śivaliṅga, and by my side the idol of Umā, which is
<div n="lb"/>my power in an embodied form.” The devas returned
<div n="lb"/>and did as they were directed.
