PAYOṢṆĪ¦. A holy river. This river starts from the
<div n="lb"/>Vindhya mountains and flows to the west. Nala and
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī walked through the banks of this river.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 61, Vana Parva). Those who bathe in this
<div n="lb"/>river will get the benefit of doing a thousand godānas
<div n="lb"/>(gifts of cows). There is a sacred place on the shores of
<div n="lb"/>this river called Varāhatīrtha. King Nṛga performed a
<div n="lb"/>Yāga at this place at which Indra came and had
<div n="lb"/>Somapāna and the brahmins received dakṣiṇā (fees)
<div n="lb"/>and got drunk. (Chapters 88 and 121, Vana Parva).
<div n="lb"/>Even the mere contact of water-drops of Payoṣṇī river
<div n="lb"/>would absolve one of all sins. The musical instrument
<div n="lb"/>Śṛṅga of Śiva is in this river. Dharmaputra once came
<div n="lb"/>to this river and stayed there for some time drinking
<div n="lb"/>its water. (Chapter 120, Vana Parva). On another
<div n="lb"/>occasion Gaya son of King Amūrtarayas conducted
<div n="lb"/>seven aśvamedhas at this place and pleased Indra.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 21, Anuśāsana Parva).
