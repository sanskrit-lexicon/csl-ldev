RĀVAṆA¦. The Rākṣasa King of Laṅkā who had ten
<div n="lb"/>heads.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā—
<div n="lb"/>Pulastya—Viśravas—Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Viśravas, grandson of Brahmā and son of
<div n="lb"/>Pulastya married Kaikasī, daughter of Sumālī. While
<div n="lb"/>Viśravas and Kaikasī were living in the forest Śleṣmā-
<div n="lb"/>taka, Kaikasī became pregnant. She delivered four
<div n="lb"/>children in four Yāmas, with an interval of one yāma
<div n="lb"/>between them. The elder three were the famous
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa; the
<div n="lb"/>fourth one, a girl, was named Śūrpaṇakhā. (Kamba
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Kubera was another son of Viśravas born of another
<div n="lb"/>wife called Devavarṇī alias Īlabilā. As soon as he
<div n="lb"/>came of age Kubera captured the Puṣpaka chariot and
<div n="lb"/>began ruling the kingdom with Laṅkā as capital.
<div n="lb"/>(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Previous lives of Rāvaṇa.%} See under Jaya XI.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rāvaṇa secured boons.%} Kaikasī (Rāvaṇa's mother)
<div n="lb"/>who became envious of the pomp and prowess of Kubera
<div n="lb"/>advised her son to secure boons from Brahmā by tapas
<div n="lb"/>and become equal to Kubera. Accordingly he went to
<div n="lb"/>Gokarṇa with his brothers and began tapas. Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa did tapas for 10,000 years; Vibhīṣaṇa also did
<div n="lb"/>tapas for 10,000 years standing on one foot. Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>standing in the middle of the five fires, meditated upon
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Though 10,000 years passed thus, Brahmā did
<div n="lb"/>not appear yet. Rāvaṇa then cut one of his ten heads
<div n="lb"/>and made an offering of it to Brahmā in the fire. Thus,
<div n="lb"/>within 9000 years he cut nine of his heads and offered
<div n="lb"/>them to Brahmā in the fire. Lastly when he was about
<div n="lb"/>to cut off his tenth head, Brahmā appeared and asked
<div n="lb"/>him to choose whatever boon he wanted. Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>chose the boon that from none but men should he
<div n="lb"/>meet with his death. Kumbhakarṇa desired to secure
<div n="lb"/>the boon of ‘nirdevatva’ (Absence of the devas) but
<div n="lb"/>secured by a slip of the tongue ‘nidrāvatvam’ (sleep).
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa chose devotion to Viṣṇu. On his return
<div n="lb"/>after securing the boons, Rāvaṇa occupied Laṅkā,
<div n="lb"/>drove away Kubera and took his puṣpaka chariot.
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa further declared Mahāviṣṇu to be his eternal
<div n="lb"/>enemy. Hearing about Rāvaṇa's victory the Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>from Pātāla came to live in Laṅkā.
[Page646-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Family life.%} Rāvana married Mandodarī, foster-
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Mayāsura and three sons, Meghanāda,
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya and Akṣakumāra were born to the couple. He
<div n="lb"/>then conquered the whole world with the cooperation
<div n="lb"/>of his sons and other Rākṣasas. The Aṣṭadikpālakas
<div n="lb"/>(protectors of the eight regions) were subjugated. He
<div n="lb"/>attacked Devaloka, but was defeated and imprisoned.
<div n="lb"/>Meghanāda by magical trickery captured Indra and
<div n="lb"/>released Rāvaṇa from custody. Meghanāda came to be
<div n="lb"/>called Indrajit from that day onwards.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kārtavīryārjuna and Rāvaṇa.%} See under Kārtavīry-
<div n="lb"/>ārjuna, Para 6.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Curses heaped on Rāvaṇa.%} As a result of ruling the
<div n="lb"/>land, as a terror to the whole world, for many years
<div n="lb"/>and of his triumphal journey Rāvaṇa had invited on

<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Nalakūbara śāpa.%} Rāvaṇa once insulted Rambhā,
<div n="lb"/>the betrothed wife of Nalakūbara during her tour at a

<div n="lb"/>kūbara cursed that Rāvaṇa should die with his ten
<div n="lb"/>heads broken.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Vedavatīśāpa.%} While Vedavatī, the only daughter
<div n="lb"/>of sage Kuśadhvaja, was doing tapas to secure Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava as her husband. Rāvaṇa committed rape on
<div n="lb"/>her and she cursed him thus:—“You and your family
<div n="lb"/>will be ruined by Lord Nārāyaṇa on account of me.”
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Brāhmaṇaśāpa.%} He invited a Vedic brahmin to
<div n="lb"/>install the idol of Tripurasundarī given to him by
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. As the brahmin happened to be a bit late to
<div n="lb"/>come, Rāvaṇa imprisoned him for seven days, and
<div n="lb"/>the old brahmin cursed that Rāvaṇa would be imprison-
<div n="lb"/>ed seven months by a man.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Nandikeśvaraśāpa.%} For calling him ‘monkey’ at
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa, Nandikeśvara cursed that Rāvaṇa and his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom would be destroyed by monkeys.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Vasiṣṭhaśāpa.%} As Vasiṣṭha refused Rāvaṇa's invi-
<div n="lb"/>tation to teach the Vedas etc. he took the former
<div n="lb"/>captive. When he was released from captivity by the
<div n="lb"/>solar King Kuvalayāśva, Vasiṣṭha cursed that Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and his family would be destroyed by those born in the
<div n="lb"/>solar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Aṣṭāvakraśāpa.%} Rāvaṇa once saw sage Aṣṭāvakra
<div n="lb"/>at Śleṣmātaka and gave him a kick saying, ‘Oh!
<div n="lb"/>handsome fellow! I shall cure your eight hunches”,
<div n="lb"/>and the sage cursed Rāvaṇa as follows:—For kicking
<div n="lb"/>me, a poor innocent sage, you will be kicked from head
<div n="lb"/>to foot and foot to head by monkeys.”
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Dattātreyaśāpa.%} Rāvaṇa once poured on his own
<div n="lb"/>head water kept purified by mantras by Dattātreya to
<div n="lb"/>bathe the head of his Guru, and the latter cursed that
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa's head would be polluted by the feet of monkeys.
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Dvaipāyanaśāpa.%} When Rāvaṇa molested and
<div n="lb"/>wounded the lips of Dvaipāyana's sister in his own
<div n="lb"/>presence he cursed that Rāvaṇa's sister would be
<div n="lb"/>mutilated by a man and he would be humiliated by
<div n="lb"/>monkeys.
<div n="NI"/>(ix) {%Māṇḍavyaśāpa.%} During a pleasure trip of his with

[Page646-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(xi) {%Nāradaśāpa.%} Nārada refused to explain the
<div n="lb"/>meaning of ‘Om’ to Rāvaṇa and the latter threatened

<div n="lb"/>man.
<div n="NI"/>(xii) {%Ṛtuvarmaśāpa.%} Rāvaṇa once raped Madana-
<div n="lb"/>mañjarī, wife of Ṛtuvarman, who lived as an anchorite
<div n="lb"/>in the marutta forest, and the latter cursed that

<div n="NI"/>(xiii) {%Maudgalyaśāpa.%} Once maharṣi Maudgalya was
<div n="lb"/>sitting in the svastika pose resting his neck on the
<div n="lb"/>yogadaṇḍa (a short stick-like piece of wood with a
<div n="lb"/>handle) Rāvaṇa happened to come there and he cut
<div n="lb"/>into two the yogadaṇḍa with his Candrahāsa (sword)
<div n="lb"/>with the result that the maharṣi fell down with face
<div n="lb"/>upwards and broke his back-bone. The maharṣi then
<div n="lb"/>cursed that Rāvaṇa's Candrahāsa would prove in-
<div n="lb"/>effective in future.
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) {%Brāhmaṇajananīśāpa.%} Certain young brahmin
<div n="lb"/>girls who had gone for sea-bath were humiliated by

<div n="lb"/>his very presence by monkeys.
<div n="NI"/>(xv) {%Agniśāpa.%} Rāvaṇa once humiliated Svāhādevī,

<div n="NI"/>(xvi) {%Anaraṇyaśāpa.%} Rāvaṇa killed by one blow on
<div n="lb"/>his chest King Anaraṇya of the solar dynasty who
<div n="lb"/>sought refuge with him, and the King cursed that

<div n="lb"/>arrows of a prince of the solar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>(xvii) {%Bṛhaspati śāpa.%} When Rāvaṇa was about to
<div n="lb"/>return after conquering Devaloka and taking the devas
<div n="lb"/>captives, Sulekhādevī, daughter of Bṛhaspati tried to

<div n="lb"/>would die hit by the arrows of Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>(xviii) {%Brahmadevaśāpa.%} Rāvaṇa tried to humiliate
<div n="lb"/>Puñjikādevī, daughter of Brahmā, and the latter cursed
<div n="lb"/>that Rāvaṇa would die with all his ten heads broken
<div n="lb"/>if he touched unwilling women.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Rāvaṇa got Candrahāsa.%} See under Candrahāsa.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%He threatened Devas.%} Rāvaṇa, during his triumphal
<div n="lb"/>march with the armies, once came to the Uśīravīra
<div n="lb"/>mountain. Then the King called Marutta was per-
<div n="lb"/>forming Maheśvara yajña on the plains of the moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain. Indra and the other devas came to receive their
<div n="lb"/>portion of the offerings. But they ran away in fear on
<div n="lb"/>the arrival of Rāvaṇa. Indra assumed the form of a
<div n="lb"/>peacock, Yama that of a crow, Kubera that of a
<div n="lb"/>chameleon and Varuṇa that of a swan, and the devas,
<div n="lb"/>thus assuming various forms went away in different
<div n="lb"/>directions. Marutta got angry and got ready to fight
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. But, as the maharṣis prevented him from it no
<div n="lb"/>fighting took place. Rāvaṇa returned with the
<div n="lb"/>glories of victory.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%He defeated Kāla.%} Once Nārada felt the urge to
<div n="lb"/>witness a quarrel. He went to Laṅkā and told Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>tales about Kāla, that Kāla was more powerful than
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, that Kāla would soon be causing Rāvaṇa's
<div n="lb"/>death etc. These stories awakened the anger in Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>against Kāla, and the former, with a strong army
<div n="lb"/>challenged Kāla, and war between the two started.
[Page647-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā was in a fix, for he had given Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>the boon that the latter would be killed only by a man.
<div n="lb"/>At the same time he had given the boon to Kāla that
<div n="lb"/>anybody thrashed with his (Kāla's) club would die.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, therefore, decided to end the fighting between
<div n="lb"/>Kāla and Rāvaṇa somehow, and he approached Kāla
<div n="lb"/>and requested him to withdraw from fighting. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly Kāla acknowledged defeat and thus the fighting
<div n="lb"/>ended.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Rāvaṇa attacked Pātāla.%} Afterwards Rāvaṇa march-
<div n="lb"/>ed with his army to Pātāla where he defeated Takṣaka,
<div n="lb"/>the nāga King and exacted tributes from him. Then
<div n="lb"/>he attacked Nivātakavacas. When the fighting became
<div n="lb"/>very fierce Brahmā intervened and brought about a
<div n="lb"/>compromise between the two. Next, Rāvaṇa attacked
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi in Varuṇa's palace, but the Rākṣasas who
<div n="lb"/>emerged from the pores on Surabhi's body drove away
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Raped Rambhā.%} See under Nalakūbara.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%His death.%} Rāvaṇa's sister, Śūrpaṇakhā met Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa at Pañcavaṭī and wanted first
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and then Lakṣmaṇa to marry her. But,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa cut away her nose, breasts etc. Enraged by
<div n="lb"/>this Rāvaṇa abducted Sītā. Śrī Rāma, with the help of
<div n="lb"/>the monkey-army, killed Rāvaṇa in war. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Synonyms of Rāvaṇa.%} Daśakandhara, Daśānana,
<div n="lb"/>Daśāsya, Paulastya, Pulastyatanaya, Rakṣaḥpati,
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasādhipa, Rākṣasamaheśvara. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
