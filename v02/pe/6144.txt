SANDHYĀ III¦. Time of union or conjunction. There are
<div n="lb"/>three Sandhyās in a day. These are morning sandhyā
<div n="lb"/>(Prātaḥsandhyā), noon sandhyā (Madhyāhna sandhyā)
<div n="lb"/>and evening sandhyā (Sāyaṃ Sandhyā). The meeting
<div n="lb"/>time of night and day, is morning Sandhyā, the joining
<div n="lb"/>time of the first half and the second half of the day,
<div n="lb"/>is noon (Madhyāhna Sandhyā), and the joining time of
<div n="lb"/>day and night, is evening Sandhyā (Sāyaṃ sandhyā).
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins should keep the three Sandhyās properly.
<div n="lb"/>The morning sandhyā is of three kinds. Good, Medium
<div n="lb"/>and Bad. When the morning stars are seen and the sun-
<div n="lb"/>rise is approaching it is good morning; when the stars
<div n="lb"/>are not seen and the sun is not risen it is medium
<div n="lb"/>sandhyā and the morning time after the sunrise is bad
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā. In sāyaṃsandhyā also there is this difference
<div n="lb"/>of time, as good, medium and bad. The time till the sun-
<div n="lb"/>set is good; the time after the sunset and before the
<div n="lb"/>rising of the stars is medium and the evening after the
<div n="lb"/>rising of the stars is bad. In the Vedas it is metaphoric-
<div n="lb"/>ally mentioned that Brahmins are trees, and the three
<div n="lb"/>sandhyās are their roots, the Vedas, their branches and
<div n="lb"/>the rites and rituals ordained in the Vedas their leaves.
<div n="lb"/>From this it is clear that Brahmins should on no
<div n="lb"/>account leave unobserved, worships at these three
<div n="lb"/>sandhyās. The Brahmin who does not observe these three
<div n="lb"/>sandhyās carefully will, in his life time, become a
<div n="lb"/>śūdra and after the death, will be born again as a dog.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover the Brahmin who does not do the three even-
<div n="lb"/>ing, morning and noon worships, will have no right to
<div n="lb"/>conduct any other Vedic rites.
<div n="NI"/>After the sun-rise and sun-set, within three nāzhikas
<div n="lb"/>(a nāzhika-24 minutes) the morning and evening wor-
<div n="lb"/>ship should be finished. There is atonement ordered
<div n="lb"/>for morning and evening prayers conducted after the
<div n="lb"/>stipulated time. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11).
