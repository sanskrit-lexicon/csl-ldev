SANDHYĀ III¦. Time of union or conjunction. There are
three Sandhyās in a day. These are morning sandhyā
(Prātaḥsandhyā), noon sandhyā (Madhyāhna sandhyā)
and evening sandhyā (Sāyaṃ Sandhyā). The meeting
time of night and day, is morning Sandhyā, the joining
time of the first half and the second half of the day,
is noon (Madhyāhna Sandhyā), and the joining time of
day and night, is evening Sandhyā (Sāyaṃ sandhyā).
Brahmins should keep the three Sandhyās properly.
The morning sandhyā is of three kinds. Good, Medium
and Bad. When the morning stars are seen and the sun-
rise is approaching it is good morning; when the stars
are not seen and the sun is not risen it is medium
sandhyā and the morning time after the sunrise is bad
Sandhyā. In sāyaṃsandhyā also there is this difference
of time, as good, medium and bad. The time till the sun-
set is good; the time after the sunset and before the
rising of the stars is medium and the evening after the
rising of the stars is bad. In the Vedas it is metaphoric-
ally mentioned that Brahmins are trees, and the three
sandhyās are their roots, the Vedas, their branches and
the rites and rituals ordained in the Vedas their leaves.
From this it is clear that Brahmins should on no
account leave unobserved, worships at these three
sandhyās. The Brahmin who does not observe these three
sandhyās carefully will, in his life time, become a
śūdra and after the death, will be born again as a dog.
Moreover the Brahmin who does not do the three even-
ing, morning and noon worships, will have no right to
conduct any other Vedic rites.
<div n="NI"/>After the sun-rise and sun-set, within three nāzhikas
(a nāzhika-24 minutes) the morning and evening wor-
ship should be finished. There is atonement ordered
for morning and evening prayers conducted after the
stipulated time. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11).
