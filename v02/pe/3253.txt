KAṆVA I¦. (KĀŚYAPA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Kaṇva attained Purāṇic fame
as the father who brought up Śakuntalā. From Ṛgveda
[Page385-b+ 64]
it can be gathered that the Kaṇva family was very
prominent among the Ṛṣi families of ancient India.
Because he was born in the family of sage Kaśyapa,
son of Brahmā, Kaṇva was known as Kāśyapa also.
Kaṇva's father was Medhātithi as could be seen by a
reference to him in Śloka 27, Chapter 208 of Śānti
Parva as Medhātithisuta. Kaṇva was staying in a her-
mitage on the banks of the river Mālinī, with a num-
ber of disciples.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kaṇvāśrama.%} Vana Parva of Mahābhārata states
that Kaṇvāśrama was on the northern shore of the
river Praveṇī. According to certain critics Kaṇvāśrama
was situated on the banks of the river Cambal, four
miles to the south of ‘Kota’in Rājputānā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Kaṇva got Śakuntalā.%} Once Viśvāmitra started
a severe penance and Indra desiring to obstruct the
attempt sent the enchanting Menakā to entice him.
They fell in love with each other and soon Menakā
bore a girl. The parents left the child in the forest and
went their way. Birds (Śakuntas) looked after her for
some time and so she was named Śakuntalā. Accident-
ally Kaṇva came that way and took the child to his
Āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Yāga of Bharata.%} Bharata, son of Duṣyanta,
performed a peculiar type of Yāga called ‘Govitata’ with
Kaṇva as the chief preceptor to officiate. (Śloka 130,
Chapter 74, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaṇva and Duryodhana.%} Once Kaṇva narrated to
Duryodhana how Mātali and his wife Sudharmā went
to him in search of a suitable husband to their daughter
Guṇakeśī. (Chapter 97, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kaṇva, a sage of the east.%} When Śrī Rāma returned
to Ayodhyā after his exile many sages from many
different parts came to visit him. Kaṇva was one of
those who came from the east. The others who came
along with him were, Vasiṣṭha, Atri, Viśvāmitra,
Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvāja, Sanaka, Śarabhaṅga
Durvāsas, Mataṅga, Vibhāṇḍaka and Tumburu.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kaṇva and Ṛgveda.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) There are ten Maṇḍalas in Ṛgveda. The Maṇ-
ḍalas from two to seven are written by different Ṛṣi fami-
lies. The second Maṇḍala was written by the Bhārgava
family of ṛṣis, the third by the Viśvāmitra family, the
fourth by that of Vāmadeva, the fifth by Atri, the sixth
by that of Bharadvāja and the seventh by the family
of Vasiṣṭha. Fifty Sūktas of the first Maṇḍala and the
whole of the eighth Maṇḍala were written by Kaṇva.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kaṇva had a son named Medhātithi. Sūkta twelve
of Anuvāka four in the first Maṇḍala of Ṛgveda is
written making Medhātithi a sage.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Kaṇva had a daughter named Indīvaraprabhā
by Menakā. (Kathāsaritsāgara). (See under Candrā-
valoka and Kasyapa I).
