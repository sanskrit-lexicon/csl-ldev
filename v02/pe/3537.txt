KILI¦ (PARROT).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} About the origin of Kilis (parrots) the
<div n="lb"/>following is stated in Canto 14, Araṇya Kāṇḍa of the
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa, the grandson of Brahmā and son of Marīci
<div n="lb"/>married the eight daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati, one of
<div n="lb"/>them being called Tāmrā. Tāmrā had five daughters
<div n="lb"/>called Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī.
<div n="lb"/>Śukas or Kilis (parrots) are the offsprings of Śukī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Parrots acquire talking faculty.%} Lord Śiva agreed to
<div n="lb"/>beget a son to kill Tārakāsura, at the request of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas. The coitus between Śiva and Pārvatī for the
<div n="lb"/>purpose did not end even after a hundred years. Due
<div n="lb"/>to the pressure of the process the whole world shook,
<div n="lb"/>and when the world appeared to get destroyed the
<div n="lb"/>Devas asked Agnideva to persuade Śiva to stop. But,
<div n="lb"/>afraid of approaching Śiva Agni ran off and hid him-
<div n="lb"/>self in the ocean. The Devas followed him, and animals
<div n="lb"/>in the water which were burning with the heat of
<div n="lb"/>Agni, told the Devas that Agni was hiding in the sea.
<div n="lb"/>But, Agni cursed them all to dumbness, and leaving the
<div n="lb"/>ocean hid himself on mount Mandara. The parrots
<div n="lb"/>revealed this secret, when Agni cursed them also and
<div n="lb"/>made their tongues fold inwards. The Devas and the
<div n="lb"/>parrots requested for redemption from the curse.
<div n="lb"/>Redemption was granted thus: “Though the tongue
<div n="lb"/>be turned inwards your sound will be melodious. Just
<div n="lb"/>like the voice of a child your (parrots') sound also will
<div n="lb"/>be sweet and wonderful.”
<div n="NI"/>From that day onwards parrots began talking and
<div n="lb"/>singing. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga
<div n="lb"/>6 and Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 85).
