KILI¦ (PARROT).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} About the origin of Kilis (parrots) the
following is stated in Canto 14, Araṇya Kāṇḍa of the
Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa, the grandson of Brahmā and son of Marīci
married the eight daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati, one of
them being called Tāmrā. Tāmrā had five daughters
called Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī.
Śukas or Kilis (parrots) are the offsprings of Śukī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Parrots acquire talking faculty.%} Lord Śiva agreed to
beget a son to kill Tārakāsura, at the request of the
Devas. The coitus between Śiva and Pārvatī for the
purpose did not end even after a hundred years. Due
to the pressure of the process the whole world shook,
and when the world appeared to get destroyed the
Devas asked Agnideva to persuade Śiva to stop. But,
afraid of approaching Śiva Agni ran off and hid him-
self in the ocean. The Devas followed him, and animals
in the water which were burning with the heat of
Agni, told the Devas that Agni was hiding in the sea.
But, Agni cursed them all to dumbness, and leaving the
ocean hid himself on mount Mandara. The parrots
revealed this secret, when Agni cursed them also and
made their tongues fold inwards. The Devas and the
parrots requested for redemption from the curse.
Redemption was granted thus: “Though the tongue
be turned inwards your sound will be melodious. Just
like the voice of a child your (parrots') sound also will
be sweet and wonderful.”
<div n="NI"/>From that day onwards parrots began talking and
singing. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga
6 and Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 85).
