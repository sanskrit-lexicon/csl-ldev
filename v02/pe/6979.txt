SUGRĪVA I¦. Bāli and Sugrīva were brothers. Their
<div n="lb"/>mother was Aruṇa who once put the guise of a woman.
<div n="lb"/>At that time he was called by the name Aruṇī. Bāli
<div n="lb"/>was the son born to Indra by Aruṇī and Sugrīva was the
<div n="lb"/>son born to the Sun by Aruṇī. Both of them were
<div n="lb"/>brought up in the hermitage of Gautama. When the
<div n="lb"/>King of Kiṣkindhā Ṛkṣarajas died, Bāli was anointed
<div n="lb"/>the king of Kiṣkindhā. Sugrīva lived with Bāli, serving
<div n="lb"/>him. At this time Bāli engaged in a battle with the
<div n="lb"/>asura Dundubhi. Bāli chased Dundubhi into a cave.
<div n="lb"/>Placing Sugrīva at the mouth of the cave, Bāli went
<div n="lb"/>in. By the magic and sorcery of Dundubhi, it appeared
<div n="lb"/>to Sugrīva that Bāli was killed by Dundubhi. Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>returned to Kiṣkindhā. Bāli who came out, followed
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva to kill him due to misunderstanding. Bāli chased
<div n="lb"/>Sugrīva all over the world. It is mentioned in Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 46, that the know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge of the lay-out of the various countries in the
<div n="lb"/>world that Sugrīva got in this running, helped him
<div n="lb"/>later, in the search for Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>At last Sugrīva entered Ṛṣyamūkācala. Bāli had been
<div n="lb"/>once cursed that if he entered this mountain his head
<div n="lb"/>would be broken into pieces. Hanūmān became the
<div n="lb"/>minister of Sugrīva. It was during this period that Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa came by that way in search
<div n="lb"/>of Sītā. Sugrīva and Śrī Rāma entered into a treaty.
<div n="lb"/>Bāli should be killed and Kiṣkindhā should be given
<div n="lb"/>to Sugrīva in place of which Rāma should be helped to
<div n="lb"/>find out Sītā and get her back.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma killed Bāli and gave Kiṣkindhā to Sugrīva,
<div n="lb"/>who sent monkey-armies in all directions to find out
<div n="lb"/>Sītā. Hanūmān found out Sītā and returned to Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, who fought a great battle with Rāvaṇa, in which
<div n="lb"/>battle Sugrīva took a prominent part. It was Kumbha-
<div n="lb"/>karṇa, who oppressed the monkey army much. When
<div n="lb"/>he caught Sugrīva, Kumbhakarṇa lost his ears and
<div n="lb"/>nose. Then he caught hold of the monkey warriors and
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma cut off his hands with arrows. (Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1). After the war, when Rāma and others
<div n="lb"/>returned to Ayodhyā, Sugrīva also accompanied them.
<div n="lb"/>After that Sugrīva returned to Kiṣkindhā. After a few
<div n="lb"/>years Candragupta, the second son of Sahasramukha
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa, carried away the daughter of Sugrīva. Hear-
<div n="lb"/>ing this, Śrī Rāma confronted Sahasramukha Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>who was killed by the arrow of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>Sugrīva participated in the horse-sacrifice performed by
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma. The control of the army was in the hands
<div n="lb"/>of Sugrīva, the financial affairs, with Vibhīṣaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>central powers, with Lakṣmaṇa. When the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>was completed, Sugrīva returned to Kiṣkindhā.
