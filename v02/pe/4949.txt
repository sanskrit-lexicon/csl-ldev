PAÑCACŪḌĀ¦. A nymph. Once Śuka, son of Vyāsa by
<div n="lb"/>his yogic powers entered the Ākāśa. Then a host of
<div n="lb"/>celestial maidens led by Pañcacūḍā stood watching him
<div n="lb"/>in admiration. (See under Śuka)
<div n="NI"/>Bhīṣma once told Dharmaputra that women were fickle-
<div n="lb"/>minded and the cause of evils. To explain his statement
<div n="lb"/>he pointed out to the conversation between Nārada
<div n="lb"/>and Pañcacūḍā. Nārada once conducted a world tour
<div n="lb"/>during the course of which he met Pañcacūḍā and asked
<div n="lb"/>her the characteristics of women. She replied thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Even beautiful, venerable and noble ladies would stoop
<div n="lb"/>to folly. It is not the habit of women to leave away
<div n="lb"/>charming men of wealth if they get them conveniently.
<div n="lb"/>Any woman can be tamed if you please her in the
<div n="lb"/>proper way. If women remain faithful to their husbands
[Page548-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>it is because they are afraid of scandal. They will enjoy
<div n="lb"/>men without looking into their age or figure. The desire
<div n="lb"/>for men in women can be compared to that of Antaka
<div n="lb"/>(god of Death) for the lives of men. This is the secret
<div n="lb"/>of womanhood.” (Chapter 38, Anuśāsana Parva).
