PRĀṆĀYĀMA¦. Prāṇa means the wind in the body and
<div n="lb"/>āyāma means restraint. Prāṇāyāma means restraining
<div n="lb"/>or suspending breath. Spread on the floor a piece of
<div n="lb"/>cloth, or animal-skin or Kuśa grass and sitting on it
<div n="lb"/>cross-legged, controlling all actions of the sense-organs
<div n="lb"/>and concentrating on one single object do prāṇāyāma
<div n="lb"/>for the purification of the soul. There are three different
<div n="lb"/>kinds of prāṇāyāmas namely Recakaprāṇāyāma, Pūra-
<div n="lb"/>kaprāṇāyāma and Kumbhakaprāṇāyāma.
<div n="NI"/>Holding the nostrils with the left hand and massaging
<div n="lb"/>the belly with the other hand one sends out the air within
<div n="lb"/>the belly. It is called Recakaprāṇāyāma. Doing just the
<div n="lb"/>reverse and getting air inside is called Pūrakaprāṇā-
<div n="lb"/>yāma. Then the yogī sits, with his belly full of air.
<div n="lb"/>Sitting thus without either letting the air out or letting
<div n="lb"/>it in is called Kumbhakaprāṇāyāma. Here the yogī sits
<div n="lb"/>like a pūrṇa-kumbha (full jar). The body of man is a
<div n="lb"/>chariot, the sense organs its horses, mind the charioteer
<div n="lb"/>and prāṇāyāma the whip. (Chapter 373, Agni Purāṇa).
