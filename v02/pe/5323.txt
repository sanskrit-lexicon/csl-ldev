PRĀṆĀYĀMA¦. Prāṇa means the wind in the body and
āyāma means restraint. Prāṇāyāma means restraining
or suspending breath. Spread on the floor a piece of
cloth, or animal-skin or Kuśa grass and sitting on it
cross-legged, controlling all actions of the sense-organs
and concentrating on one single object do prāṇāyāma
for the purification of the soul. There are three different
kinds of prāṇāyāmas namely Recakaprāṇāyāma, Pūra-
kaprāṇāyāma and Kumbhakaprāṇāyāma.
<div n="NI"/>Holding the nostrils with the left hand and massaging
the belly with the other hand one sends out the air within
the belly. It is called Recakaprāṇāyāma. Doing just the
reverse and getting air inside is called Pūrakaprāṇā-
yāma. Then the yogī sits, with his belly full of air.
Sitting thus without either letting the air out or letting
it in is called Kumbhakaprāṇāyāma. Here the yogī sits
like a pūrṇa-kumbha (full jar). The body of man is a
chariot, the sense organs its horses, mind the charioteer
and prāṇāyāma the whip. (Chapter 373, Agni Purāṇa).
