CĀRVĀKA I¦. A Rākṣasa, who was a close friend of
Duryodhana. The following story is told about how he
happened to become Duryodhana's friend.
<div n="NI"/>In the Kṛtayuga this Rākṣasa did tapas to please Brah-
mā at Badaryāśrama, and Brahmā gave him the
boon that he would be safe from all beings. Then he
went round the world troubling brahmins, who, at
last sought refuge in Brahmā, and he pacified them
with the assurance that Cārvāka would become a friend
of Duryodhana when he would insult Brahmins and
be reduced to ashes in the fire of their anger.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Cārvāka became a friend of Duryodhana.
When, after the great war, Dharmaputra entered
Hastināpura with his followers thousands of brahmins
gathered around and blessed him. Cārvāka also dis-
guised as a brahmin came there and condemning Dhar-
maputra as an enemy of his own people cursed him.
The brahmins recognised him and cursed him to ashes.
(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapters 38, 39).
