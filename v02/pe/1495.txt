CĀRVĀKA I¦. A Rākṣasa, who was a close friend of
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana. The following story is told about how he
<div n="lb"/>happened to become Duryodhana's friend.
<div n="NI"/>In the Kṛtayuga this Rākṣasa did tapas to please Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mā at Badaryāśrama, and Brahmā gave him the
<div n="lb"/>boon that he would be safe from all beings. Then he
<div n="lb"/>went round the world troubling brahmins, who, at
<div n="lb"/>last sought refuge in Brahmā, and he pacified them
<div n="lb"/>with the assurance that Cārvāka would become a friend
<div n="lb"/>of Duryodhana when he would insult Brahmins and
<div n="lb"/>be reduced to ashes in the fire of their anger.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Cārvāka became a friend of Duryodhana.
<div n="lb"/>When, after the great war, Dharmaputra entered
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura with his followers thousands of brahmins
<div n="lb"/>gathered around and blessed him. Cārvāka also dis-
<div n="lb"/>guised as a brahmin came there and condemning Dhar-
<div n="lb"/>maputra as an enemy of his own people cursed him.
<div n="lb"/>The brahmins recognised him and cursed him to ashes.
