ATIBALA I¦. The Maharṣi Atibala was the cause of the
death of Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>After the war with Rāvaṇa, Śrī Rāma returned to Ayo-
dhyā with his retinue and began his reign. After re-
nouncing Sītā while Śrī Rāma was living in the palace
with Lakṣmaṇa, Śatrughna and their families, one day
Brahmā summoned Yama and said: “Śrī Rāma is the
incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu. He has fulfilled all the pur-
poses of the incarnation. Now Viṣṇu has to be recalled
to Vaikuṇṭha”.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Yama assuming the guise of a Sanny-
āsi named Atibala appeared before Śrī Rāma. He said
he had to tell a secret to Śrī Rāma. Accordingly Śrī
Rāma sent everyone else out of the audience chamber.

Lakṣmaṇa was asked to guard the entrance. It was
announced that if anyone entered the hall, Lakṣmaṇa
would be killed.
<div n="NI"/>At this stage, Maharṣi Durvāsas arrived at the entrance
accompanied by many of his disciples. He had come
after having performed penance for a thousand years
and in great hunger and thirst. He wanted to see the
King to ask for sumptuous food. Lakṣmaṇa requested
him to wait a little but Durvāsas refused to do so. He
even threatened that he would reduce all of them to
ashes by his curse. Finding no alternative, Lakṣmaṇa
entered the hall and informed Śrī Rāma of the situation.
Durvāsas was given a sumptuous meal. But for the ful-
filment of the condition Lakṣmaṇa's death became neces-
sary. Śrī Rāma cried with a broken heart. The honest
Lakṣmaṇa went alone to the Sarayū river and drowned
himself in its depths. Soon after, Śrī Rāma entrusting
the affairs of the state to others and in the presence of
thousands of spectators plunged into the Sarayū river
and renouncing his earthly life, returned to Vaikuṇṭha.
