VIVĀHA¦ (MARRIAGE).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} In ancient India marriage was
<div n="lb"/>considered to be a sacrifice performed in accordance with
<div n="lb"/>social customs. Marriage was allowed to those who had
<div n="lb"/>completed education at the age of sixteen. (Samāvar-
<div n="lb"/>tana). Father or teacher teaches the pupil the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>and Vedāṅgas. When the education is completed the
<div n="lb"/>teacher or father makes him sit on a seat decorated
<div n="lb"/>with flowers, sandalwood etc. and do Godānavrata. Then
<div n="lb"/>he is offered Pañcāmṛta (milk, curd, butter, honey and
<div n="lb"/>water). This is called Samāvartana. With this his
<div n="lb"/>brahmacarya ends, and he is allowed to marry and
<div n="lb"/>lead the life of a house-holder.
<div n="NI"/>Marriage is a ceremony with four secondary rites Viz,
<div n="lb"/>Kanyādāna, Śacīyāga, Vivāha, Caturthīkarman. If the
<div n="lb"/>husband is dead, or lost, or has renounced the world,
<div n="lb"/>or has become a eunuch or is expelled from society, the
<div n="lb"/>woman is allowed to take another husband. If the
<div n="lb"/>husband dies, the wife should be given to the brother
<div n="lb"/>of the husband. If there is no brother she could accept
<div n="lb"/>anybody whom she likes.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Eight kinds of marriages.%} The woman and man
<div n="lb"/>should not be of the same Gotra (family). One could
<div n="lb"/>marry a girl who is above seven generations on the
<div n="lb"/>paternal line and above five generations on the mater-
<div n="lb"/>nal line. Eight types of marriages allowed in Manu-
<div n="lb"/>smṛti, Chapter 3, are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Brāhma.%} A man of good qualities and good family
<div n="lb"/>is asked to come and receive the damsel. This is
<div n="lb"/>Brāhma. The radiance of this marriage will give the
<div n="lb"/>man prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Ārṣa.%} After getting a couple of cows from the
<div n="lb"/>bridegroom the bride is given to him.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Prājāpatya.%} The virgin is given to the man, who
<div n="lb"/>had requested for her hand as a duty.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Daiva.%} The virgin is offered to the master who is
<div n="lb"/>engaged in performing a sacrifice.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Gāndharva.%} Marriage between a man and a woman
<div n="lb"/>with equal love on either part.
