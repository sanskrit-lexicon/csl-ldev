KṚTYĀ¦ (KṚTYAKĀ) I. A Rākṣasī who is born when
the black arts as enunciated in the Atharvaveda are
practised to annihilate enemies. Kṛtyā may appear in
male form too. Some of the activities of Kṛtyā are
given below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Carried off Duryodhana.%} While the Pāṇḍavas were
living in exile in the forest, Duryodhana and others
went in a procession to the forest. Though Duryodhana
was taken into captivity in the forest by a Gan-
dharva, Arjuna saved him out of fraternal considera-
tion for him. Duryodhana returned to Hastināpura.
Now the question was whether half of the kingdom
[Page432-b+ 64]
should be given to the Pāṇḍavas or not. Śakuni and
others advised Duryodhana to give it, but the latter
remained adamant against it. Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to
end his life and for the purpose spread darbha grass on
earth and sat thereon. The Asuras heard about these
developments and created a Kṛtyā by mantras. The
Kṛtyā took Duryodhana to Pātāla where the Asuras
advised him against any compromise with the Pāṇḍa-
vas. On the other hand they wanted him to intensify
his hatred against the Pāṇḍavas, and they assured
him all support. After that Kṛtyā took Duryodhana
back to Hastināpura. (Vana Parva, Chapter 252).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Kṛtyā born under the name Madana.%} Devendra once
prevented the Aśvinīdevas from drinking Soma juice.
<div n="NI"/>(Devas drink a liquid-liqueur extracted from the soma
creeper, during yajñas, and that is called Somapāna).
Aggrieved at the orders of Indra the Aśvinīdevas
wandered about the world in the course of which they
approached sage Cyavana of the Bhārgava family.
They restored sight to the blind Cyavana, who, in
return, assured them that he would see to it that they
got the right of drinking soma juice. Cyavana began
a Yajña and Indra came for Somapāna. The sage
invited the Aśvinīdevas also for Somapāna. Indra
prevented them from doing so, and the sage opposed
him. Then Indra drew his Vajrāyudha against Cyavana.
The sage made Indra's hands paralysed. Further, he
raised from the Yājñic fire a Kṛtyā which appeared in
male form under the name Madana. Sharp molar
teeth hundred yojanas long, other teeth each ten yoja-
nas long, hands ten thousand yojanas long and as big
as mountains, round eyes like the Sun and Moon,
mouth spitting fire—such was Madana, the Kṛtyā, a
really terrible being. Frightened at the sight of the
terrible being Indra permitted the Aśvinīdevas to drink
Soma.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Kṛtyā against Ambarīṣa.%} Ambarīṣa once began the
Ekādaśī Vrata and the Devas deputed Durvāsas to
obstruct it somehow or other. Durvāsas came to
Ambarīṣa, who requested him to return after bath.
But, though the vrata was over the sage did not return
and Ambarīṣa fed the Devas with the offerings (havis).
Immediately after that Durvāsas returned and com-
plained that what he was given was the left-overs of
the havis, By means of black art he created a Kṛtyā,
who charged against Ambarīṣa's throat. Ambarīṣa
prayed and the Sudarśana Cakra of Viṣṇu appeared and
killed the Kṛtyā and drove Durvāsas round the three
worlds. At last the sage sought refuge with Ambarīṣa
himself and thus saved himself. (Bhāgavata, 9th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Kṛtyā opposed Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} While Kṛṣṇa was ruling
Dvārakā, Pauṇḍrakavāsudeva was the King of Kārūṣa.
Once he sent a messenger to ask Kṛṣṇa to go and bow
down before him as he was the real Vāsudeva. Enraged
at this insolent demand Kṛṣṇa cut off Pauṇḍraka's head
with the Sudarśana Cakra. The dead King's son,
Sudakṣiṇa, to gather power enough to fight Kṛṣṇa
went to Kāśī and performed penance to please Śiva.
Śiva appeared and taught him the method of creating
Kṛtyā. Accordingly he created from fire, a Kṛtyā, who
dashed against Kṛṣṇa roaring like hell. Kṛṣṇa used the
Sudarśana Cakra, which burnt to death not only the
Kṛtyā, but also Sudakṣiṇa.

<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kṛtyā against Prahlāda.%} To change the nature of
Prahlāda, a great devotee of Viṣṇu, his father Hiraṇya-
kaśipu deputed Asura preceptors. But, severe punish-
ments like poisoning, throwing into fire etc. did not
succeed in changing the devotee's character. At last,
the preceptors raised Kṛtyā from fire. The Śūlam,
which Kṛtyā thrust against the throat of Prahlāda was
broken into hundreds of pieces. Kṛtyā then got angry
and turned against the preceptors, who had sent her
against Prahlāda. The preceptors fell down unconscious
on the verge of death. But, Prahlāda touched their
bodies and they became alive again. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Part 1, Chapter 18).
