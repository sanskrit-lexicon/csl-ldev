KHĀṆḌAVADĀHA¦.
<div n="lb"/>1){%Introduction.%} Long ago a King named Śvetakī began
<div n="lb"/>to perform a sacrifice of duration of 100 years. Many
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins took part in the sacrifice as priests conducting
<div n="lb"/>the rituals and ceremonies. These Brahmin priests be-
<div n="lb"/>gan to depart after a few years turning blind due to the
<div n="lb"/>smoke coming out of the sacrificial fire. Thus the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>was stopped for want of priests. Śvetakī was grieved at
<div n="lb"/>this and performed penance to Śiva for getting a
<div n="lb"/>priest. Śiva appeared before him and pointed out
<div n="lb"/>hermit Durvāsas as the priest. Śvetakī recommenced the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice and under the supervision of Durvāsas the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice was completed. But Fire god caught dysen-
<div n="lb"/>tery due to the continuous eating of oblations offered in
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial fire for a long period. His face became
<div n="lb"/>pale, body became lean, and he had no taste for food.
<div n="lb"/>At last Fire-God went to Brahmā and complained
<div n="lb"/>about his disease. Brahmā said that in the forest of
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍava there lived so many creatures which were
<div n="lb"/>enemies of the devas (gods) and that by eating their
<div n="lb"/>fat the disease of Agni would be cured. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Agni came to the Khāṇḍava forest.
[Page409-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>The serpent Takṣaka, a friend of Indra, lived in this
<div n="lb"/>forest with his wife and children. Indra knew that Agni
<div n="lb"/>had come to burn the Khāṇḍava forest and resolved to
<div n="lb"/>save Takṣaka at any cost. When Agni (fire) began to
<div n="lb"/>catch the forest, Indra had already begun rain. So it
<div n="lb"/>was not possible for Agni to consume the forest. Agni
<div n="lb"/>tried seven times to consume the forest and in all these
<div n="lb"/>seven attempts he failed. Agni again approached
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, who told him that the Nara-Nārāyaṇas would
<div n="lb"/>take birth in the earth as Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna and that
<div n="lb"/>at that time it would be possible for fire to consume the
<div n="lb"/>forest Khāṇḍava.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna in the forest of Khāṇḍava.%} While the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas were living in Indraprastha, once the hot
<div n="lb"/>season became so unbearable that Arjuna took Kṛṣṇa with
<div n="lb"/>him and went to the forest of Khāṇḍava. While they
<div n="lb"/>were playing in the river Yamunā with their wives
<div n="lb"/>Agni came there in the guise of an old Brahmin and told
<div n="lb"/>them all that had happened and requested their help
<div n="lb"/>for eating the Khāṇḍava forest. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>promised to help him in this affair.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Preparation of weapons.%} For the time being Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Arjuna were not having sufficient weapons. Agni
<div n="lb"/>(fire-god) thought of Varuṇa (the God of water) who
<div n="lb"/>instantly appeared. At the request of Agni Varuṇa gave
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna the famous bow ‘Candradhanus’ (Gāṇḍīva), a
<div n="lb"/>quiver which would never become empty of arrows
<div n="lb"/>and a chariot having a flag with the sign of monkey.
<div n="lb"/>and to Śrī Kṛṣṇa the weapon of the discus. Varuṇa gave
<div n="lb"/>four white horses also with gold chains round their necks
<div n="lb"/>for drawing the chariot of Arjuna. With these weapons
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna got ready to help Agni. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>became the charioteer of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Burning the forest.%} When Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna stood
<div n="lb"/>ready Agni began to consume the forest. Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna guarded the boundaries of the forest so that
<div n="lb"/>the inmates of the forest might not escape. The living
<div n="lb"/>creatures ran hither and thither finding no way to
<div n="lb"/>escape. Many died of suffocation. At that time the
<div n="lb"/>hermits who were dwellers of that forest ran to Indra
<div n="lb"/>and informed him of the great calamity. Indra instantly
<div n="lb"/>got ready to fight and save the forest. He covered the
<div n="lb"/>whole of the sky with clouds and a heavy rain was
<div n="lb"/>showered on the forest. Arjuna created a covering of
<div n="lb"/>arrows like an umbrella over the fire and saved him
<div n="lb"/>from the rain.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The family of Takṣaka.%} At this particular time
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka had been away at Kurukṣetra. Aśvasena the
<div n="lb"/>son of Takṣaka was writhing with heat and pain.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing this his mother (wife of Takṣaka) swallowed him
<div n="lb"/>from tail to head. Then she ran to the boundary to
<div n="lb"/>throw the child into the outer region. Seeing this
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna got angry and cut at the head of Aśvasena. But
<div n="lb"/>at the nick of time Indra sent a storm and made Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>swoon and Aśvasena was saved. So Arjuna became
<div n="lb"/>furious and began to cut down every creature he saw.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa and Agni together cursed Aśvasena that
<div n="lb"/>he would get refuge nowhere.
<div n="NI"/>Aśvasena kept up his hatred of Arjuna. In the Bhārata
<div n="lb"/>battle, Aśvasena got on an arrow sent by Karṇa at
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna and knocked off the crown of Arjuna and return-
<div n="lb"/>ed. But due to the curse Karṇa did not receive him
<div n="lb"/>back.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Deadly fight.%} The serpents and hawks confronted
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, who cut off their heads. Kṛṣṇa killed the
[Page409-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Asuras with the weapon discus. Indra came to the
<div n="lb"/>battle-field riding on his elephant Airāvata. Kāla
<div n="lb"/>(Time), Kubera, Skanda, Aśvinīdevas and all the other
<div n="lb"/>Devas (gods), and Asuras (demons) helped Indra in the
<div n="lb"/>fight. But Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna came out victorious.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The advent of Maya.%} Meanwhile Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna called Indra and told him who they were and
<div n="lb"/>informed him that Takṣaka had gone to Kurukṣetra.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this Indra blessed Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>retreated from the battlefield. Agni began to consume
<div n="lb"/>the forest more vigorously than before. Because of the
<div n="lb"/>unbearable heat, Maya, the architect of the Asuras,
<div n="lb"/>came out of the house of Takṣaka and ran to Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Arjuna and entreated them to save him. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna saved him from the fire.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The story of four birds which escaped from the fire.%} In
<div n="lb"/>that forest a hermit named Mandapāla had erected his
<div n="lb"/>hermitage and lived there performing penance. He died
<div n="lb"/>and went to the world of ancestors. But there, the hermit
<div n="lb"/>did not attain any fruit of the penance he had performed.
<div n="lb"/>The hermit asked the Devas for the reason. They replied
<div n="lb"/>that it was because the hermit had no sons. The hermit
<div n="lb"/>came to the forest again to marry and beget sons.
<div n="lb"/>Mandapāla married a bird called Jaritā. Four sons named
<div n="lb"/>Jaritāri, Sārisṛkka, Stambamitra and Droṇa, were born
<div n="lb"/>to them. After this Mandapāla left Jaritā and her sons
<div n="lb"/>and went after another woman Lapitā.
<div n="NI"/>Feathers were not yet grown on the body of Jaritā's
<div n="lb"/>four sons. The burning of the forest began before it.
<div n="lb"/>Jaritā and her sons were in a sorry plight. The mother
<div n="lb"/>could fly. But she did not think of leaving her young
<div n="lb"/>ones in danger. She decided to die in the fire folding
<div n="lb"/>the young ones under her wings. But her sons did not agree
<div n="lb"/>to it. They entreated her to fly away. Thus moments of
<div n="lb"/>tears passed by. At last Jaritā told them crying, “There
<div n="lb"/>is the hole of a rat closeby. The rat had been taken
<div n="lb"/>away by a kite. I will take you to that hole and close
<div n="lb"/>it. Then I shall go away and return when the fire is
<div n="lb"/>abated.”
<div n="NI"/>But the young ones did not agree to this. They loved
<div n="lb"/>to be killed by fire, rather than to be killed by rat. Final-
<div n="lb"/>ly at their request Jaritā flew away.
<div n="NI"/>Mandapāla thought of his sons. He separated from
<div n="lb"/>Lapitā, and came to Agni and requested him to save
<div n="lb"/>his sons and Jaritā. Agni consumed the forest and
<div n="lb"/>neared the birds. The young birds requested Agni to
<div n="lb"/>save them. Agni Deva saved them. Mandapāla and
<div n="lb"/>Jaritā returned. That family lived for a long time in
<div n="lb"/>joy and happiness and finally attained the world of the
<div n="lb"/>gods. Agni returned to heaven after the burning of
<div n="lb"/>the forest of Khāṇḍava. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 233
<div n="lb"/>to 346).
