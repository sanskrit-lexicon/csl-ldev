EKATA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} An ancient sage. He was the
son of the Maharṣi Gautama. He had two brothers,
Dvita and Trita.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Ekata became a wolf by a curse.%} There is a story
of how Ekata and Dvita duped Trita in the Mahā-
bhārata. When Gautama died Trita became the chief of
the three. Dvita and Ekata did not like this. Once all
the three were passing by a forest with a herd of cows for
a yāga. Trita was walking ahead and the other two were
following him with the cows. At a strategic point on the
way the brothers carried away the cows by a separate
route without the knowledge of Trita. When Trita
came to know of the loss he was greatly distressed. On
reaching the shores of the river Sarasvatī, he was frigh-
tened by a wolf and running to escape from the animal
fell into a dilapidated well. He performed a yāga from
where he lay. Assuming a creeper inside the well to be
Somalatā, Trita recited the Ṛks and the devas responded
to his prayer. Devas like Bṛhaspati graciously appeared
before him and asked him to demand a boon from
them. Trita replied that his desire was to worship the
gods standing on the waves of the river Sarasvatī.
Accordingly the river was made to flow that way and
standing on the waves Trita worshipped the gods. After
that he went home and cursed his brothers and made
Ekata and Dvita into wolves.
