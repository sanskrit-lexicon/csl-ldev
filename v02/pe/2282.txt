EKATA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} An ancient sage. He was the
<div n="lb"/>son of the Maharṣi Gautama. He had two brothers,
<div n="lb"/>Dvita and Trita.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Ekata became a wolf by a curse.%} There is a story
<div n="lb"/>of how Ekata and Dvita duped Trita in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata. When Gautama died Trita became the chief of
<div n="lb"/>the three. Dvita and Ekata did not like this. Once all
<div n="lb"/>the three were passing by a forest with a herd of cows for
<div n="lb"/>a yāga. Trita was walking ahead and the other two were
<div n="lb"/>following him with the cows. At a strategic point on the
<div n="lb"/>way the brothers carried away the cows by a separate
<div n="lb"/>route without the knowledge of Trita. When Trita
<div n="lb"/>came to know of the loss he was greatly distressed. On
<div n="lb"/>reaching the shores of the river Sarasvatī, he was frigh-
<div n="lb"/>tened by a wolf and running to escape from the animal
<div n="lb"/>fell into a dilapidated well. He performed a yāga from
<div n="lb"/>where he lay. Assuming a creeper inside the well to be
<div n="lb"/>Somalatā, Trita recited the Ṛks and the devas responded
<div n="lb"/>to his prayer. Devas like Bṛhaspati graciously appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him and asked him to demand a boon from
<div n="lb"/>them. Trita replied that his desire was to worship the
<div n="lb"/>gods standing on the waves of the river Sarasvatī.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly the river was made to flow that way and
<div n="lb"/>standing on the waves Trita worshipped the gods. After
<div n="lb"/>that he went home and cursed his brothers and made
<div n="lb"/>Ekata and Dvita into wolves.
