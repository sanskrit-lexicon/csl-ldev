SUMITRA VIII¦. A King of the Hehaya dynasty. He
once went hunting and followed a deer for a long
distance to no purpose. The sad King then entered a
tapovana and conversed with the munis about the
desires and attachments of man. Then the muni called
Ṛṣabha related to the King the stories of the munis,
Vīradyumna and Tanu and as a result of Ṛṣabha's
advice the King renounced all desires and turned
to the path of salvation. (Śānti Parva, Chapters 125,
126 and 127).
