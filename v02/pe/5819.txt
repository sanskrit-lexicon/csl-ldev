RUDRĀKṢA¦. (Elaco Carpus seeds) Beads for rosaries.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A holy thing worn by devotees.
In the Purāṇas much importance is attached to Rudrākṣa.
In Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, there is a story stating
how Rudrākṣa came to be honoured in this way.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived an asura chief who was mighty and
valiant. His name was Tripura. He defeated Devas and
deva chiefs and became emperor of the asuras. The Devas
were much grieved because of him. They went to Śiva and
represented their grievances. Śiva thought for a while,
how to kill Tripura, and sat with open eyes. This sitting
continued for a thousand divine years. After this pro-
longed time Śiva winked his eyes and tears fell down
from them. The Rudrākṣa tree originated from these
tears. From the Sun-eye of Śiva twelve types of
Rudrākṣas came into being; from the moon-eye sixteen
kinds of Rudrākṣas and from the fire-eye ten kinds of
Rudrākṣas originated. Those which originated from
the Sun-eye are blood coloured, those from the moon-eye
white Rudrākṣas and from the fire-eye black rudrākṣas.
Boiled Rudrākṣa is considered a Brahmin caste, red
rudrākṣa a Kṣatriya caste, white one a Vaiśya caste
and the black rudrākṣa a Śūdra caste.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Division of rudrākṣa based on quality.%} The division of
rudrākṣa according to the number of faces, and qualities
thereof are given below:
<div n="NI"/>{%With one face:%} Rudrākṣa with only one face is the figure
of Śiva. By wearing this remission from the sin of
Brahmahatyā could be procured.
<div n="NI"/>{%With two faces:%} Rudrākṣa with two faces is the figure of

By wearing this remission from all sins committed know-
ingly and unknowingly, would be obtained.

been enjoyed, could be obtained. All sorts of sins would
be absolved by five-faced rudrākṣa.
