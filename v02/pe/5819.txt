RUDRĀKṢA¦. (Elaco Carpus seeds) Beads for rosaries.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A holy thing worn by devotees.
<div n="lb"/>In the Purāṇas much importance is attached to Rudrākṣa.
<div n="lb"/>In Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, there is a story stating
<div n="lb"/>how Rudrākṣa came to be honoured in this way.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived an asura chief who was mighty and
<div n="lb"/>valiant. His name was Tripura. He defeated Devas and
<div n="lb"/>deva chiefs and became emperor of the asuras. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>were much grieved because of him. They went to Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>represented their grievances. Śiva thought for a while,
<div n="lb"/>how to kill Tripura, and sat with open eyes. This sitting
<div n="lb"/>continued for a thousand divine years. After this pro-
<div n="lb"/>longed time Śiva winked his eyes and tears fell down
<div n="lb"/>from them. The Rudrākṣa tree originated from these
<div n="lb"/>tears. From the Sun-eye of Śiva twelve types of
<div n="lb"/>Rudrākṣas came into being; from the moon-eye sixteen
<div n="lb"/>kinds of Rudrākṣas and from the fire-eye ten kinds of
<div n="lb"/>Rudrākṣas originated. Those which originated from
<div n="lb"/>the Sun-eye are blood coloured, those from the moon-eye
<div n="lb"/>white Rudrākṣas and from the fire-eye black rudrākṣas.
<div n="lb"/>Boiled Rudrākṣa is considered a Brahmin caste, red
<div n="lb"/>rudrākṣa a Kṣatriya caste, white one a Vaiśya caste
<div n="lb"/>and the black rudrākṣa a Śūdra caste.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Division of rudrākṣa based on quality.%} The division of
<div n="lb"/>rudrākṣa according to the number of faces, and qualities
<div n="lb"/>thereof are given below:
<div n="NI"/>{%With one face:%} Rudrākṣa with only one face is the figure
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva. By wearing this remission from the sin of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmahatyā could be procured.
<div n="NI"/>{%With two faces:%} Rudrākṣa with two faces is the figure of
<div n="lb"/>Devīdeva. This is known by the name “Gaurīśaṅkara”.
<div n="lb"/>By wearing this remission from all sins committed know-
<div n="lb"/>ingly and unknowingly, would be obtained.
<div n="NI"/>{%With three faces:%} This is the figure of Agni (fire). By
<div n="lb"/>wearing this the sin incurred by Strīhatyā (killing a
<div n="lb"/>woman) would be washed away.
<div n="NI"/>{%With four faces:%} Rudrākṣa with four faces is the figure

<div n="lb"/>been eaten and enjoying woman who ought not to have
