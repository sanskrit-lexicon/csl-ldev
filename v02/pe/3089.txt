KĀLABHĪTI¦. A devotee of Śiva. As his father Māṃṭi
<div n="lb"/>performed penance for the sake of a son for a thousand
<div n="lb"/>years his wife conceived, but did not deliver. Māṃṭi
<div n="lb"/>asked the child in his mother's womb why he did not
<div n="lb"/>come out to which the latter replied that he did not
<div n="lb"/>come out as he feared the Asura called Kālamārga. (As
<div n="lb"/>the child feared Kālamārga it came to be called
<div n="lb"/>Kālabhīti). As advised by Śiva, Māṃṭi created in the
<div n="lb"/>child knowledge about dharma, renunciation etc. and
<div n="lb"/>thus made him conscious about higher knowledge. The
<div n="lb"/>child came out of the mother's womb. In due course of
<div n="lb"/>time Kālabhīti took to the worship of Śiva, who blessed
<div n="lb"/>him as follows: “Since you have outlived Kālamārga,
<div n="lb"/>in future you will become famous as Mahākāla.”
<div n="lb"/>(Skanda Purāṇa).
