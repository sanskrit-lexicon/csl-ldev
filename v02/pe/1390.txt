CAKRIKA¦. A forest hunter. The following story is
told about him in Chapter 16, Kriyāyoga of the Padma
Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Devoted much to his parents, Cakrika was a great
devotee of Viṣṇu. He used to worship Viṣṇu daily with
fruits, (edible) roots etc. But, he did so only after
himself tasting them. One day while thus tasting a
fruit, somehow or other it got itself lodged in his
throat, and all his attempts to dislodge it failed. The
fruit had to be, at any rate, offered to Viṣṇu and there-
fore Cakrika drew his sword and cut his throat with it.
Lord Viṣṇu who was so pleased at such great devotion
of the man appeared on the scene and brought him
back to life. Sometime afterwards Cakrika expired at
the Dvārakā temple, and thus attained salvation.
