KAṆḌU¦. A great sage of ancient Bhārata. He was the
father of Māriṣā (Vārkṣī) wife of the Pracetas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth of Māriṣā.%} Māriṣā, daughter of Kaṇḍu, took
her birth from a tree. There is an interesting story about
this in Viṣṇu Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Sage Kaṇḍu, chief of the devajñas, was performing
penance in a hermitage on the banks of the river
Gomatī. Devendra sent Pramlocā, an enchanting
nymph, to Kaṇḍu to distract him from his penance.
Pramlocā by her sweet words and enticing manners won
the heart of the sage and Kaṇḍu accepting her as his
wife went to the valley of Mandara and lived there
happily for a hundred years.
<div n="NI"/>One day Pramlocā went and bowed before her husband
and sought his permission to go back to Devaloka.
“Dear, stay here for some time more” replied the sage.
Another hundred years went by. Again one day she
went and sought permission to go home. Again the
sage asked her to stay for a while more. Centuries
passed without the sage losing even a little of his
amour. On the other hand every day it found different
channels of expression. One evening the sage stepped
out of his Āśrama and on seeing that Pramlocā en-
quired where he was going.
<div n="NI"/>Sage: The sun is going to set. I am going to do my
sandhyāvandana. I do not want to bring a break in
my daily ablutions and duties.
<div n="NI"/>Pramlocā: Oh, Righteous one, did the sun set for you
only today ? The Sunset of hundreds of years has gone
by without your knowing.
<div n="NI"/>Sage: Dear, you came to this holy river-shore only
this morning. It was only this morning that I saw you
coming to my Āśrama for the first time. Now the day
[Page384-b+ 65]
is over and dusk is coming. Why this ridicule? Please
do tell me the truth.
<div n="NI"/>Pramlocā: That I came to you one fine morning is
quite true. But since that several centuries have
elapsed.
<div n="NI"/>Sage: How many years have gone by since I started
enjoying with you?
<div n="NI"/>Pramlocā.: Nine hundred years, six months and three
days have passed since I came to you.
<div n="NI"/>The great sage became very angry and scolded
Pramlocā much. That beautiful maiden heard it all
standing bathed in perspiration. The sage in rage
commanded the trembling nymph to go away from
his presence. Pramlocā, thus reprimanded and sent
away, rose up in the air and travelled by it. As she
flew, the perspiration of her body was absorbed by the
tender leaves of trees on the way. She was pregnant
at that time and the embryo which went forth along
with her perspiration was absorbed in bits by the
tender leaves and sprouts. Wind gathered them from the
different trees and made everything into one. Moon-
light gave it development and gave it the form of a
woman. She was named Māriṣā. That was how Māriṣā
was born of trees (Chapter 15, Aṃśa 1. Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse of Kaṇḍu.%} Kaṇḍu's dear son aged sixteen
died in a forest. Grief-stricken, the sage cursed that
forest and made it a desert. There was no water
there and all the trees became dried and dead.
Hanūmān and party who went in search of Sītā came to
this place. (Chapter 48, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaṇḍu in the presence of Śrī Rāma.%} When Śrī Rāma
returned to Ayodhyā after his exile many sages from
all the four different parts came to visit him. Those
who came from the south were Kaṇḍu, Dattātreya
Namuci, Pramuci, Vālmīki, Soma and Agastya.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
