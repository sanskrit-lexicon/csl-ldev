JAYATSENA IV¦. A King who took the side of the
Kauravas. He was son of Jarāsandha. This King came
with an akṣauhiṇī of army and helped the Kauravas
in the battle of Bhārata. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
16, Stanza 16). It is mentioned in Karṇa Parva,
Chapter 5, Stanza 30 that this King was killed by
Abhimanyu.
<F>1.) The Mahābhārata mentions two princes of Magadha, bearing the same name ‘Jayatsena’. The fathers of both of them happen
to be Jarāsandhas. But it is said that after the death of the famous Jarāsandha his son Sahadeva became king. This Sahadeva, with his
brother Jayatsena took the side of the Pāṇḍavas and fought against the Kauravas. Hence the King Jayatsena mentioned here must be the
son of some other Jarāsandha of the Kingdom of Magadha.</F>
