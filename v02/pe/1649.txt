DADHĪCA¦. (DADHĪCI).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} A famous hermit. Mention is made in
Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 83, that
this hermit was the son of the great hermit Bhṛgu, and
[Page191-b+ 64]
that he was made of the essences of the world, with a
huge body.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The birth of the hermit Sārasvata.%} Dadhīca erected his
hermitage on the bank of the river Sarasvatī and began
to do penance. The power of penance increased daily.
Seeing this Indra was flurried. So he sent the celestial
maid Alaṃbuṣā to break the penance of Dadhīca some-
how or other. Alaṃbuṣā came to the hermitage of
Dadhīca and began to dance and sing. When the hermit
saw her he grew lustful and seminal discharge occurred
to him. The semen fell in the river Sarasvatī, who be-
came pregnant and in due course gave birth to a child.
She took the child to the hermit Dadhīca and told him
the story of the child. The hermit was much pleased.
He took the child and embraced it and blessed the river
Sarasvatī thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“Brahmā, the gods and the celestial maids will be pleased
if your water is offered as oblation.”
<div n="NI"/>Dadhīci then said that the child should be named Sāras-
vata. He also added that when there was a drought conti-
nuously for twelve years, Sārasvata would have the
power to bring rain. Then Sarasvatī took the child to
her abode and brought it up.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How he destroyed the asuras with the head of a horse.%} Once
Dadhīci went to the world of the devas (gods).
From there he looked down and saw the earth filled with
the asuras. Indra went to destroy them. But he could
not. So he made a search for anything left behind by
Dadhīca. He understood that Dadhīca had with him
the head of a horse. It was found in a lake in the country
of Śaraṇya. With the bones taken from that head Indra
and Dadhīca destroyed a large number of asuras.
(Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 13, Sūkta 84).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The weapon%} (Vajra) of Indra was made from a bone.
A story occurs in the Mahābhārata, which says that the
Diamond-weapon of Indra was made of a bone of
Dadhīci. The asuras went to fight with Indra under the
leadership of Vṛttrāsura. Indra tried his utmost to kill
Vṛttrāsura, but he could not. At last Indra approached
Brahmā, who told Indra that if a bone of the hermit,
called Dadhīca was obtained it could effectively be used
against Vṛtra. Accordingly Indra went with Nara
and Nārāyaṇa to the banks of the river Sarasvatī and
entered the hermitage and bowed before the shining
hermit Dadhīca and informed him of their errand. The
hermit replied that he had no objection in giving his
bone to save the gods. Saying thus the hermit discarded
his life. Indra took the bone of Dadhīci and made his
weapon of Diamond (Vajra) with which he killed Vṛtra
and his followers. (Mahābhārata, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other information%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) At the sacrifice of Dakṣa, Dadhīci got angry because
Śiva was not given his dues of the sacrifice. (M.B. Śānti
Parva, Chapter 284).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once Dadhīci talked to a Brāhmin called Karuṇa
about the importance of the ashes dedicated to Śiva.
(Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 101).
