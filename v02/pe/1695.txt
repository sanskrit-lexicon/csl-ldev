DAMAYANTĪ¦ Daughter of Bhīma the King of Vidar-
bha. The most noble of all the Indian heroines, Dama-
yantī has secured a place in the literatures of almost
all the languages in the world. The famous hero Nala
is her husband.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The background of the story of Nala.%} During the time
of the forest life of the Pāṇḍavas, Arjuna had gone to
Kailāsa to do penance before Śiva for getting divine
weapons. The rest of the Pāṇḍavas spent the time
till the arrival of Arjuna, in sorrow and sadness. They
spent miserable days one by one. At that time the her-
mit Bṛhadaśva visited them. They welcomed the
hermit. In the midst of their conversation Dharma-
putra told the hermit with tears that he was the most
unhappy man in the world. Hearing this the hermit
told them the story of Nala, to console the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The birth of Damayantī.%} The King Bhīma of Vidar-
bha was childless for a long time. While the King was
spending sorrowful days, as he had no children, a
hermit named Dama reached his palace. The King
welcomed the hermit. Seeing the sorrow of the King the
hermit blessed the King and the queen, and as a result
a daughter named Damayantī and as her brothers
[Page196-b+ 64]
three sons Dama, Dānta and Damana were born to
them.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Damayantī.%} During
this period a son named Nala was born to Vīrasena the
King of Niṣadha. The child was an expert in the game
of dice and he would speak only truth. He grew up
and became a youth.
<div n="NI"/>Once the swans which came to the palace of Dama-
yantī from Nala, began to praise Nala. They sang
about the glory of Nala. Nala also knew about the
beauty and the other good qualities of Damayantī.
Thus they fell in love with each other. Nala also started
for Kuṇḍinapurī, the capital city of Vidarbha, to marry
Damayantī. The devas (gods) Indra, Agni, Varuṇa
and Yama, having heard of the beauty of Damayantī
from Nārada, had gone Kuṇḍinapurī, to take part
in the marriage. On the way they met Nala. They
were aware of the fact that Damayantī was in love
with Nala. So they called Nala and sent him to Dama-
yantī with a message that Damayantī should accept
one of the four gods as her husband. By the boon of
invisibility, given by the Gods, Nala entered the room
of Damayantī unseen by others and gave the message
to Damayantī. But Damayantī did not agree to it.
The Gods also entered the nuptial hall and took their
seats in the shape of four Nalas. Damayantī entered
the hall with the nuptial garland in her hands. She
saw five Nalas including the real Nala, and prayed to
the gods to show her the real Nala her lover. So the
devas assumed their real forms and Damayantī put
the garland on the neck of the real Nala and accepted
him as her husband. Being much pleased with the be-
haviour and character of both Nala and Damayantī,
the four gods blessed them. Agni promised to be near
Nala whenever he thought of him. Yama said that
Nala would always be righteous. Varuṇa said that
Nala would obtain water at the thought of it. Indra
blessed him saying that he would get mokṣa immedia-
tely after the completion of a yāga. The gods remained
till the end of the marriage ceremony and then they
departed. Nala and Damayantī lived in Kuṇḍinapurī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The hatred between Kali and Dvāpara.%} Hearing about
the Svayamvara of Damayantī Kali and Dvāpara
started for Kuṇḍinapurī. On the way they met Indra
and the other gods, who were returning from the marri-
age of Damayantī. They told Kali and Dvāpara that
Damayantī had accepted Nala as her husband. Kali
and Dvāpara got angry at this and returned saying
that they would destroy the kingdom of Nala. After
that Kali waited for a chance to enter the body of
Nala. After twelve years, once Nala, after passing
urine, without washing his legs performed his evening
worship. At that moment Kali entered the body of
Nala. With that Nala became bereft of all senses of
righteousness and duty, and challenged his younger
brother Puṣkara to a game of dice. Puṣkara engaged
Nala in the game of dice. Kali stood in the shape of
an ox as helper of Nala. Nala lost his kingdom in the
game. Seeing that her husband was being defeated
continuously, Damayantī sent for the charioteer Vārṣ-
ṇeya and sent her son Indrasena and daughter Indra-
senā to Kuṇḍinapurī. After leaving the children at Kuṇḍi-
napurī Vārṣṇeya engaged himself in a travel. After
visiting several countries he reached Ayodhyā and
[Page197-a+ 65]
became the charioteer of King Ṛtuparṇa.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Nala and Damayantī to the forest.%} Puṣkara got the
kingdom, wealth and everything that his elder brother,
Nala, had possessed. The miserable Nala left every-
thing he had and clad in only one cloth got out of the
palace. His wife Damayantī followed him. They stayed
outside the city for three days. Puṣkara made a pro-
clamation that if anybody rendered any help to Nala
he would be ruthlessly put to death. After that Nala stay-
ed there for three more days, with only water for food
and drink. Then he went to the forest. His wife followed
him. They were hungry. Nala saw some golden birds.
Nala wanted to catch them for food. So he took his
only cloth and spread it on the ground. The birds
took that cloth and flew away. Those birds were the
dices used in the game. They were influenced by
Kali. The miserable and hungerstricken Nala asked
his wife Damayantī to go with the caravan traders
who were going to Avanti and save herself. But she
did not consent to go away from him.
<div n="NI"/>They spent that night in an inn. They both fell asleep
because of weakness. After a time Nala woke up.
He thought that his wife would somehow or other
get to some country closeby and save herself, if he
left her there. So he decided to take half of her cloth.
How to do it without her knowledge? Thinking so he
walked round the inn. He saw a good sword. He
took the sword, and cut half of the cloth of Damayantī
and leaving her in the inn he went away.
<div n="NI"/>In a short while she woke up and missing her husband
she cried aloud and ran here and there in search of
him. Then she went into the forest crying. A big snake
caught hold of her and began to swallow her. She cried
aloud. Hearing the cry, a forester came there. He
cut the snake open and saved Damayantī. But when
he saw her he became overpowered by libido and
tried to make her his wife. She got angry and cursed
him and he instantly fell down dead. After this she
began to wander in the forest aimlessly, often seeing
wild animals and fearing them. At last she got on a
rock and sat there and began to wail thinking of Nala.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Damayantī in the kingdom of Cedi.%} While she was
sitting on the rock wailing, a caravan of traders came
by that way. They had been attacked by a herd of
elephants and were running away from them. They
saw Damayantī. She told them her story. They brought
her to the kingdom of Cedi. She wandered through
the country for a while and finally reached the palace
of the King Subāhu. Thinking her to be a mad wo-
man the street boys were following her. The queen
saw the woman surrounded by street boys and felt
pity for her. She sent her maid and brought her to
the palace. Without revealing that she was the queen
of King Nala, she told everything else to the queen.
The queen consoled her and said that she would get her
husband back. She invited Damayantī to stay in the
palace till she got her husband back. Damayantī
replied as follows: “Mother, I shall stay here. But
there are certain conditions. I won't eat remains and
offals of victuals, I won't make others to wash my legs.
I won't talk with men who are not related to me. If
anybody hankers after me you must order him to be
killed. Brāhmaṇas may come and see me only in con-
nection with the search for my husband. This is my
vow.” The queen agreed to her conditions and made
[Page197-b+ 65]
her the attendant of her daughter Sunandā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Nala in Ayodhyā.%} Nala filled with sorrow was walk-
ing along the forest when he saw a wild fire. From the
midst of the fire somebody was calling Nala by name
and crying. When Nala approached the fire, he saw
the great and famous serpent Karkoṭaka lying entwined
in the flames. Karkoṭaka the King of the Nāgas had
once deceived Nārada, who then cursed him that he
would become stationary in a place like an immovable
thing till Nala came and rescued him. From that day
onwards, Karkoṭaka was remaining in that forest with-
out moving. Then the forest caught fire. Karkoṭaka
being unable to move had to remain in the fire. Nala
immediately saved Karkoṭaka from the fire and with
that he was absolved from the curse of Nārada. Kar-
koṭaka asked Nala to walk forward, counting the steps.
When Nala counted ten, Karkoṭaka bit on the leg of
Nala and he became ugly. Then the serpent said to
the flurried Nala, “Don't fear. I have made you ugly
so that others may not recognize you. Now you are
ugly because of my poison. But my poison has affected
Kali who is in your body. Because he had harmed
you who are blameless, he has to suffer for it. So long
as this poison is in you, nobody will harm you. You
must go to Ṛtuparṇa the King of Ayodhyā and tell
him that you are Bāhuka a charioteer. You must give
Ṛtuparṇa the spell ‘Aśvahṛdaya mantra’ and get
from him the spell ‘Akṣahṛdayamantra’. After that
you will have reunion with your wife and children.
Here are two cloths for you. Whenever you want
to get your original form you need only wear them.”
Saying these words Karkoṭaka gave Nala two divine
garments and then disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>Nala started for Ayodhyā. He reached the palace
on the tenth day. There he was employed as the horse
keeper of Ṛtuparṇa on a pay of hundred pieces of gold.
Thus he stayed there under the name Bāhuka. Vārṣṇeya
and Jīvala who were the horse-keepers of Ṛtuparṇa
upto that time, were placed under Bāhuka.
<div n="NI"/>Bāhuka used to recite a poem every evening when he
returned from his work.
<Poem>Weary and worn of hunger and thirst,
That poor woman, where might she be?
Serving whom will she be now.
Thinking of the unlucky fool?</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this song of lamentation everyday, once his
assistant Jīvala asked Bāhuka, whom he was reciting
the poem about. Bāhuka replied: “Once there was
a man who was a fool. He got a good wife. For some
reason they were separated. The fool is still wandering
about weary and sad in search of his wife.”
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Damayantī in Kuṇḍinapura.%} At this time Dama-
yantī was living in the palace of the King of Cedi,
as the maid of princess Sunandā. King Bhīma became
very sorry not knowing where Nala and Damayantī
had gone. He sent men in all directions to search for
them. The King proclaimed that those who found
them would be awarded thousand cows, lands assigned
to Brahmins, and villages. He proclaimed that so
many cows would be given even to those who could
give any information about them. Hearing this Brāh-
maṇas went in all directions and Sudeva, one of them,
reached the Kingdom of Cedi. He recognized Dama-
yantī who was like fire inside the cover of smoke. When
Damayantī was alone Sudeva approached her and
[Page198-a+ 65]
said that he had come from Vidarbha and that he was
a friend of Damayantī's brother. Damayantī recog-
nized Sudeva and she cried aloud. Sunandā who saw
this scene, told her mother about it. The queen sent
for Sudeva and asked him what the matter was. He
revealed everything about Damayantī, to the queen.
When they heard the story all the women in the harem
cried. Then with tears the queen said, “Hear this,
Damayantī, your mother and myself are the two daugh-
ters of Sudama the King of Daśārṇa. Father gave
your mother to Bhīma the King of Vidarbha and me
to Vīrabāhu the King of Cedi. I have seen you when
you were an infant.”
<div n="NI"/>When the King of Cedi knew everything he sent Dama-
yantī in a palanquin to Vidarbha.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The search for Nala.%} Damayantī told her father
that she didn't want to live any longer unless Nala
was brought to her. Bhīma had been trying hard to
find out Nala. One day Parṇāda one of the numerous
Brahmins who were engaged in the search for Nala,
came to Bhīma and said, “while I was wandering from
place to place, I happened to reach the palace of Ṛtu-
parṇa the King of Ayodhyā. There I made enquiries
about Nala the husband of Damayantī, in the pre-
sence of the King. But nobody gave me any answer.
When I returned Bāhuka the charioteer of Ṛtuparṇa
followed me. An ugly man with short hands, an ex-
pert in driving horses, and an excellent cook, he asked
me several questions about Damayantī.”
<div n="NI"/>When Damayantī heard this she had horripilation.
She secretly went to her mother and compelled her
to send Sudeva the Brāhmaṇa to Ayodhyā. Her mother
consented. She called Sudeva, in the presence of her
mother and told him to go to Ayodhyā and tell Ṛtuparṇa
that the second svayaṃvara (marriage) of Damayantī
would take place before sunrise next day and that
he should come earlier. Sudeva instantly went to
Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtuparṇa, hearing the words of Sudeva, wanted
Bāhuka to take him in the chariot to Vidarbha within
the period of a day time for the second svayaṃvara
of Damayantī. Nala consented with a breaking heart.
Immediately they started. Vārṣṇeya also got into
the chariot. The chariot flew through the sky with
tremendous speed, to Vidarbha. On the way the upper
garment of the King fell on the ground. He ordered
the chariot to be stopped for taking his upper garment.
Nala said that within that winking time the chariot
had travelled a yojana (league) and gloried in his
power of driving horses. Then they saw in the forest
a Tanni tree (Terminalia bellerica) with fruits. Seeing
the Tanni tree the King said, “O Bāhuka, if you are
an expert in horse-driving I am an expert in reckoning.
I will tell you how many leaves and nuts there are
in that Tanni Tree. There are five crores of leaves in
both the branches together and two thousand and
ninety-five nuts. They stopped the chariot and checked
the tree and found the reckoning of the King correct.
The King had the knowledge of the art called ‘Akṣahṛ-
daya’. It was with this art that the king calculated
the number of leaves in the tree, at one look. Bāhuka
drove the chariot with the speed of wind because he had
known the art called ‘Aśvahṛdaya’. Then and there,
Bāhuka taught the King the art of ‘Aśvahṛdaya’ and
the King taught Bāhuka the art of ‘Akṣahṛdaya’. The
[Page198-b+ 65]
moment Nala learned Akṣahṛdaya Kali vomitted
the poison of Karkoṭaka and got out of the body of
Nala. Long ago, the mother of Indrasena, a god, had
cursed Kali and drove him out. Since then Kali had
been living in the body of Nala. As soon as he came
out Kali begged Nala for pardon. Nala curbed his
anger. But Kali was afraid of Nala. So he made the
Tanni tree his abode. Because of that Tanni became
detestable.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtuparṇa, Vārṣṇeya and Bāhuka reached Kuṇḍina-
pura in the evening. When the sound of the chariot
of Nala reached the ears of Damayantī her heart bumped
with joy. The chariot was stopped and Ṛtuparṇa
entered the palace. The King Bhīma welcomed
Ṛtuparṇa heartily. As there was no sign of any prepara-
tion for the svayaṃvara (marriage) Ṛtuparṇa under-
stood that some sort of trick had been played on him.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Test of Nala.%} Damayantī sent her maid Keśinī
to Bāhuka to watch him. Keśinī had a secret talk
with Bāhuka. Though Nala did not reveal himself,
he cried when she talked about Damayantī. Keśinī
returned to Damayantī and told her what she had
heard and seen. Damayantī became more and more
convinced that Bāhuka was Nala himself So she sent
Keśinī again to Nala. She discovered the following
facts about Bāhuka, after a keen observation, and
made a report of them.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Bāhuka does not stop to pass through even a small
door. The upper sill lifts by itself for him to pass
through.
<div n="NI"/>(2) He gets enough room for him to pass through even
a big crowd.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Empty pots are filled with water at a look from him.
<div n="NI"/>(4) When he stretches out a grass to the sun, it catches
fire.
<div n="NI"/>(5) Fire does not burn him even if he touches it.
<div n="NI"/>(6) When he crushes a flower, it blooms more beauti-
ful and fragrant than before.
<div n="NI"/>When Keśinī said all these facts to Damayantī, she
became fully convinced that Bāhuka was none other
than Nala himself. Damayantī sent Keśinī again to
Bāhuka to get some meat cooked by him. Damayantī
tested the taste of the meat brought by Keśinī and
she knew that the food was cooked by Nala. She
sent Keśinī again to Bāhuka with her children. See-
ing Indrasena and Indrasenā coming to him, Bāhuka
ran to them, gathered them and embraced them and
cried aloud. Then he told Keśinī that he had done
so because the children were just like his two child-
ren.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Reunion.%} After having tested Bāhuka so far Dama-
yantī sent Keśinī to her mother to tell her everything,
and to say that she was convinced of the fact that
Bāhuka was none other than Nala and that the diffe-
rence was only in shape and to request that she may
be permitted to see Bāhuka in person. The queen
informed the King of all these facts. With the permis-
sion of her parents Bāhuka was brought to the room
of Damayantī. The moment Bāhuka saw Damayantī
he began to shed tears. Damayantī also was filled
with emotion. But she told him thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“Bāhuka, have you seen a man who had left his sleep-
ing wife in the forest? Who else, but Nala the famous
and the righteous would discard his blameless and
loving wife who had been sleeping, with fatigue and
[Page199-a+ 65]
hunger in a lonely place? Have I done anything
wrong to him in my younger days so that he should
leave me in the forest when I was sleeping? Leaving
aside real gods I married him. I worshipped, him. I had
children from his blood and now he has abandoned
me. In the presence of Gods and with fire as witness,
holding my hands he had taken a vow that he would
support and protect me. Where has that vow gone?”
At these words Bāhuka shed tears for a long time.
Then he told her all that had happened to him since
their separation. Damayantī requested Nala, not to
have any misconception regarding the idea of a second
svayaṃvara; she said to him that she committed no
wrong and that her fidelity and loyalty had undergone
no change. At that time Vāyu (the wind-god) in an
etherial voice said “Damayantī has committed no
sin”. Immediately Nala put on the divine clothes
given by Karkoṭaka and regained his original form.
Damayantī embraced Nala and cried aloud. The king
her father, mother and the people of the city all ran
to them.
<div n="NI"/>Next day Ṛtuparṇa returned. After a few days Nala
collected an army consisting of three hundred soldiers,
sixteen elephants, fifty horses and a white chariot only,
from Vidarbha and went to the kingdom of Niṣadha.
Reaching there Nala challenged Puṣkara for a game of
dice. Puṣkara refused the challenge. Nala took his
sword to cut Puṣkara into two. Finally Puṣkara agreed
to play. At the first cast of the dice the life and the
Kingdom of Puṣkara fell into the hands of Nala. But
Nala did not kill Puṣkara; instead, he embraced him.
Nala became King. Damayantī and the children reached
Niṣadha. Nala ruled the country with more happiness
and prosperity than before. (Mahābhārata, Vana
Parva, Chapters 52 to 79).
