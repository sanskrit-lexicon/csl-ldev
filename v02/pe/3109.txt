KĀLAMĀNA¦. (Calculating time). In ancient days
<div n="lb"/>in India time was calculated in the following
<div n="lb"/>manner.
<div n="NI"/>Time taken (needed) to
<div n="lb"/>pierce a leaf with a
<div n="lb"/>needle—Alpakāla
<div n="lb"/>30 Alpakālas—1 Truṭi
<div n="lb"/>30 Truṭis—1 Kalā
<div n="lb"/>30 Kalās—1 Kāṣṭhā
<div n="lb"/>30 Kāṣṭhās—1 Nimiṣa (mātrā)
<div n="lb"/>4 Nimiṣas—1 Gaṇita
<div n="lb"/>10 Gaṇitas—1 Neṭuvīrpu (time for a
<div n="lb"/>deep sigh)
<div n="lb"/>6 Neṭuvīrpus—1 Vināzhikā
<div n="lb"/>6 Vināzhikās—1 Ghaṭikā
<div n="lb"/>60 Ghaṭikās—1 Day (Ahorātra)
<div n="lb"/>15 Ahorātras—1 Pakṣa (Fortnight)
<div n="lb"/>2 Pakṣas—1 Cāndramāsa (A day for
<div n="lb"/>the Pitṛs)
<div n="lb"/>2 Māsas (months)—1 Ṛtu.
<div n="lb"/>6 Ṛtus—1 year for men (A day for
<div n="lb"/>the Devas)
<div n="lb"/>300 Years (Men's)—1 Divyavarṣa (Divine year)
<div n="lb"/>4800 Divyavarṣas—1 Kṛtayuga
<div n="lb"/>3600 Divyavarṣas—1 Tretāyuga
<div n="lb"/>2400 Divyavarṣas—1 Dvāparayuga
<div n="lb"/>1200 Divyavarṣas—1 Kaliyuga
<div n="lb"/>12000 Divyavarṣas—1 Caturyuga
<div n="lb"/>71 Caturyugas—1 Manvantara
<div n="lb"/>14 Manvantaras—1 Pralaya (Kalpa)
<div n="lb"/>1 Pralaya—Brahmā's one day.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata Tṛtīya
<div n="lb"/>skandha)
<div n="lb"/>7(1/2) Nāzhikās (Ghaṭikās)—1 Yāma
<div n="lb"/>4 Yāmas—1 day time
<div n="lb"/>8 Yāmas—1 day (day and night).
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>The ‘Kālamāna’ according to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>differs in certain respects from the calculations given
<div n="lb"/>above. Chapter 3, Part 1 of Viṣṇu Purāṇa says:—
[Page372-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Fifteen Nimiṣas make one Kāṣṭhā. Thirty Kāṣṭhās
<div n="lb"/>make one Kalā and thirty Kalās make one Muhūrta.
<div n="lb"/>Thirty Muhūrtas make one day (man's) and thirty
<div n="lb"/>such days, divided into two fortnights form a Māsa
<div n="lb"/>(month). Six months form an Ayana; there are two
<div n="lb"/>ayanas called Dakṣiṇa and Uttara. Dakṣiṇāyana is
<div n="lb"/>night, and Uttarāyaṇa is day for the Devas. 12,000
<div n="lb"/>Divyavarṣas—Deva varṣas—form a Caturyuga consisting
<div n="lb"/>of the Kṛta—Tretā—Dvāpara and Kali yugas, con-
<div n="lb"/>sisting respectively of 4000, 3000, 2000 and 1000
<div n="lb"/>Divyavarṣas. Before the commencement and after the
<div n="lb"/>end of every one of the above four yugas there is an
<div n="lb"/>interval respectively of 400, 300, 200, and 100 years.
<div n="lb"/>The interval before the commencement is called
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā and that at the end is called Sandhyāṃśa. The
<div n="lb"/>period between Sandhyā and Sandhhyāṃśa is called Kṛta
<div n="lb"/>yuga etc. One thousand Caturyugas form one day for
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, and it (Brahmā's one day) has 14 Manus.
<div n="NI"/>Again, Chapter 8, Part 2 of the Viṣṇu Purāṇa has the
<div n="lb"/>following to say about Kālamāna.
<div n="NI"/>Fifteen Nimiṣas make one Kāṣṭhā, thirty Kāṣṭhās one
<div n="lb"/>Kalā, thirty Kalās one muhūrta and thirty muhūrtas
<div n="lb"/>one day and night. Day is long or short according to
<div n="lb"/>the length or shortness of parts of the day, like morning,
<div n="lb"/>noon and evening. Despite the above variation evening
<div n="lb"/>or dusk time is always (2 nāzhikās) the same. The
<div n="lb"/>three muhūrtas from the sun's ardhodaya (when half
<div n="lb"/>of the sun has arisen) is called Prātaḥkāla, (morning)
<div n="lb"/>and it is (1/5)th of day time. The three muhūrtas
<div n="lb"/>following are known as saṃgava. Madhyāhna (noon)
<div n="lb"/>is the three muhūrtas after saṃgava. The time after
<div n="lb"/>madhyāhna is aparāhna (afternoon). Aparāhna lasts
<div n="lb"/>for three muhūrtas. The time after this is dusk. Thus,
<div n="lb"/>a day-time of fifteen muhūrtas is divided into five parts
<div n="lb"/>of three muhūrtas each. On Viṣuvat day the day will
<div n="lb"/>have full fifteen muhūrtas. Then during Uttarāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Dakṣiṇāyana the day will be longer or shorter.
<div n="lb"/>During Uttarāyaṇa the day will be longer than night,
<div n="lb"/>and during Dakṣiṇāyana vice versa. Viṣuvat occurs
<div n="lb"/>when the sun enters the Tulā (Libra) and Meṣa (Aries)
<div n="lb"/>houses. Dakṣiṇāyana is when the sun enters Cancer,
<div n="lb"/>and Uttarāyana when it enters Capricorn.
<div n="NI"/>Fifteen days and nights constitute a Pakṣa (fortnight)
<div n="lb"/>and two Pakṣas one month. Two solar months consti-
<div n="lb"/>tute a Ṛtu (season), three ṛtus one ayana and two
<div n="lb"/>ayanas one year. Since there are four kinds of months,
<div n="lb"/>i.e. Saura, Sāvana, Cāndra and Nākṣatra, years are
<div n="lb"/>considered to be of five different kinds. The first is called
<div n="lb"/>Saṃvatsara; the second parivatsara; the third iḍvatsara;
<div n="lb"/>the fourth, anuvatsara and the fifth, vatsara. This
<div n="lb"/>period of five years is called a yuga. In a yuga of five
<div n="lb"/>years there are 60 saura months, 61 sāvana months,
<div n="lb"/>62 Cāndra months and 67 nākṣatra months. At the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of the sixth year the sun and moon meet in
<div n="lb"/>the same house and that period of five years also is
<div n="lb"/>called yuga. (Śrīdharīyam).
