AYODHADHAUMYA¦ (Āyodhadhaumya). Āpoda-
<div n="lb"/>dhaumya, Apodadhaumya, Dhaumya. A great Muni
<div n="lb"/>(sage). He had three disciples, Āruṇi, Upamanyu and
<div n="lb"/>Veda.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Disciple Āruṇi.%} He belonged to Pāñcāla, and once his
<div n="lb"/>guru deputed him to construct embankments in the
<div n="lb"/>field. But, his attempts to construct embankments
<div n="lb"/>did not succeed. Finally he lay himself in the field
<div n="lb"/>where the embankment was required, and then the
<div n="lb"/>flow of water stopped. The guru enquired about Āruṇi,
<div n="lb"/>who was thus lying in the field. Then only he knew
<div n="lb"/>the reason for Āruṇi's absence. The guru went to the
<div n="lb"/>field and called Āruṇi. Then the embankment burst
[Page084-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>open and Āruṇi came out, and because of that Āruṇi
<div n="lb"/>got the name Uddālaka. (M.B., Chapter 3, Verses
<div n="lb"/>21-33).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Disciple Upamanyu.%} Once Dhaumya (the guru) asked
<div n="lb"/>his second disciple Upamanyu to tend the cows. He
<div n="lb"/>used to take care of the animals grazing in the woods
<div n="lb"/>during daytime and return home at dusk and prostrate
<div n="lb"/>before the guru. Looking at the plump and healthy
<div n="lb"/>body of Upamanyu the guru asked him how he was
<div n="lb"/>feeding himself. His reply was that he was begging
<div n="lb"/>alms and feeding himself with what he got thus. Then
<div n="lb"/>the guru asked him to hand over to him (guru) all
<div n="lb"/>alms got in future. After that he used to give everything
<div n="lb"/>he got by way of alms to the guru. And, he continued
<div n="lb"/>returning to the Gurukula at dusk and prostrating be-
<div n="lb"/>fore the guru. Finding Upamanyu even then as plump
<div n="lb"/>and healthy as he was formerly, the guru said: My
<div n="lb"/>son Upamanyu, you hand over to me all the alms you
<div n="lb"/>get, and yet your body looks as trim as of old. How
<div n="lb"/>happens it so?” Upamanyu replied: “After giving the
<div n="lb"/>alms I get first to you, my guru, I do again beg for
<div n="lb"/>alms and feed myself”. To this the guru reacted thus:
<div n="lb"/>My boy, what you do is not the proper thing. By the
<div n="lb"/>second course of alms-taking you stand in the way of
<div n="lb"/>other people getting their food. It is gross injustice to
<div n="lb"/>do so.”
<div n="NI"/>Upamanyu, from that day onwards strictly followed
<div n="lb"/>his guru's instruction, and continued returning at dusk
<div n="lb"/>to the guru and doing obeisance to him.
<div n="NI"/>Even then finding Upamanyu to be quite plump and
<div n="lb"/>healthy the guru told him: “Well, now you hand over
<div n="lb"/>to me all the alms you get, and you do not take alms
<div n="lb"/>a second time the same day. Yet you are quite fit and
<div n="lb"/>fat. How is it so?”
<div n="NI"/>To this Upamanyu's reply was that he was feeding him-
<div n="lb"/>self on the milk of the cows he tended. The guru told
<div n="lb"/>him that this too was not just and proper on his part.
<div n="lb"/>The guru had not permitted him to drink milk thus.
<div n="NI"/>Upamanyu agreed to obey his orders. And, as usual he
<div n="lb"/>continued tending the cows and returning at dusk. Even
<div n="lb"/>then he maintained the same plump and healthy phy-
<div n="lb"/>sique. And the Guru told him as follows: “You do not
<div n="lb"/>eat the food you get at the first alms-taking, you do not
<div n="lb"/>go in for alms a second time the same day, nor do you
<div n="lb"/>drink milk. Yet, how is it that you maintain the same
<div n="lb"/>fat and healthy physique as in former days?”
<div n="NI"/>Upamanyu's reply was that he was feeding now-a-days
<div n="lb"/>on the foam of milk bristling at the mouth of the
<div n="lb"/>calves when they had fed on their mother's milk. And,
<div n="lb"/>the guru said: “if that is so the calves will be, out of
<div n="lb"/>kindness and sympathy for you, releasing much foam
<div n="lb"/>of milk out of their mouths. That will affect them. So,
<div n="lb"/>do not repeat the process. Since the guru forbade him
<div n="lb"/>to have food in any manner as detailed above, Upa-
<div n="lb"/>manyu, while tending the herd of cows in the forest, ate
<div n="lb"/>the bitter and poisonous leaves of a tree one day to
<div n="lb"/>satisfy his burning hunger. The leaf was bitter in taste
<div n="lb"/>and injurious in its properties. Therefore, this new way
<div n="lb"/>of satisfying hunger affected the health of the eyes of
<div n="lb"/>Upamanyu and he became blind. Moving about in this
<div n="lb"/>condition he fell into a neglected well in the woods.
<div n="NI"/>When, even after the sun had set, Upamanyu did not,
<div n="lb"/>as usual, return, the guru enquired about him from
<div n="lb"/>other disciples. Naturally, they told the guru that
<div n="lb"/>Upamanyu was out in the forest with the cows. As the
[Page085-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>guru felt that Upamanyu was staying away late in the
<div n="lb"/>forest since he had been prevented from doing every-
<div n="lb"/>thing he (guru) went to the forest accompanied by
<div n="lb"/>other disciples and called out for Upamanyu, and
<div n="lb"/>Upamanyu responded from deep down the well. He
<div n="lb"/>also told the guru how he happened to fall into the well.
<div n="lb"/>After telling him that if only he would pray to the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīdevas they will cure his blindness the guru return-
<div n="lb"/>ed to the Āśrama with other disciples. Upamanyu,
<div n="lb"/>accordingly offered praises and prayed to the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas, who were so pleased with him that they appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him and gave him a bread. Upamanyu refused
<div n="lb"/>to eat the bread without giving it to the guru. Then
<div n="lb"/>the Aśvinīdevas told him thus: “In the past when we
<div n="lb"/>gave your guru a bread like this he ate the same with-
<div n="lb"/>out giving it to his guru. You may just imitate him
<div n="lb"/>and eat the bread yourself”. Even then Upamanyu did
<div n="lb"/>not eat the bread. The Aśvinīdevas were so much
<div n="lb"/>pleased at this that they blessed Upamanyu thus: “The
<div n="lb"/>teeth of your guru will turn into hard iron and yours
<div n="lb"/>into pure gold. Your blindness will be cured and all
<div n="lb"/>happiness and prosperity will be yours.”
<div n="NI"/>The blessings of the Aśvinīdevas took full effect, and
<div n="lb"/>Upamanyu hurried to his guru and prostrated at his
<div n="lb"/>feet. Dhaumya and the other disciples of his congratu-
<div n="lb"/>lated Upamanyu. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 3, Verses
<div n="lb"/>34-77).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Disciple, Veda.%} Ayodhadhaumya one day said to
<div n="lb"/>Veda, his third disciple: “You stay with me for some-
<div n="lb"/>time serving me. That will bring you all prosperity in
<div n="lb"/>life.” Veda agreed, and stayed for a long time in the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama in the service of the guru. Without even the
<div n="lb"/>slightest murmur he put up with every discomfort and
<div n="lb"/>hardship, be it acute hunger and thirst or extreme
<div n="lb"/>cold or heat, and gladly performed all the work and
<div n="lb"/>duties the master imposed on him. The guru was ab-
<div n="lb"/>solutely pleased and his blessings resulted in all pros-
<div n="lb"/>perity and omnipotence for the disciple. (M.B., Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 3, Verses 78-80).
