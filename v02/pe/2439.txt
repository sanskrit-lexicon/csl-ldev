GIRIKĀ¦. Wife of Uparicaravasu. This gem of a lady
was the daughter of the river Śuktimatī. There is a story
behind her marrying Uparicara.
<div n="NI"/>Śuktimatī was a river flowing through the capital city
of the kingdom of Uparicara. Once the mountain
Kolāhala driven by amorous desires subdued Śuktimatī.
The next morning on finding no river in its place the
people were surprised. The news reached the ears of the
King. He became furious and rushing to the mountain
gave it a hard kick. It created a hole in the mountain
and the river flowed through it. But by that time
Kolāhala had got a son and a daughter of Śuktimatī.
Greatly pleased at the King for setting her free from
Kolāhala, Śuktimatī gave her children to the King. The
King brought up the son and made him the chief of his
army. The girl was brought up and named Girikā and
when she was of marriageable age the King married her.
<div n="NI"/>When once Girikā was having her monthly period the
King was forced to go to the forests for hunting. While
in the forests he saw the animals having sexual acts and
as he thought of Girikā at home he had emission. He
never wanted to waste the seminal fluid. He wrapped it
in a leaf and sent it to his wife through a kite. Another
kite thinking it to be something to eat attacked the packet
and it fell into a river down below. A fish swallowed it
and later when a fisherman caught it and opened its
belly a boy and a girl came out of it. The girl was
Satyavatī mother of Vyāsa. (10th Skandha, Devī
Bhāgavata).
