PRĀCĪNABARHIS¦. A prajāpati. (For genealogy see
<div n="lb"/>under Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>Pṛthu got two sons named Antardhāna and Vādī who
<div n="lb"/>were very virtuous. A son named Havirdhāna was
<div n="lb"/>born to Antardhāna of his wife Śikhaṇḍinī. Dhiṣaṇā
<div n="lb"/>born of the family of Agni became the wife of Havir-
<div n="lb"/>dhāna and they got six sons named Prācīnabarhis,
<div n="lb"/>Śukra, Gaya, Kṛṣṇa, Vraja and Ajina. Of these Prācīna-
<div n="lb"/>barhis became a great Prajāpati. He carpeted the world
<div n="lb"/>with darbha grass with its head turned towards the
<div n="lb"/>east and thus got the name (Prācī = east; barhis = bed
<div n="lb"/>of Kuśa grass) Prācīnabarhis. He performed great
<div n="lb"/>penance and married Savarṇā, daughter of the oceans.
<div n="lb"/>They got ten sons who were called Pracetases and who were
<div n="lb"/>all masters of dhanurveda (archery). They all perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed penance for ten thousand years lying submerged
<div n="lb"/>in water. Brahmā persuaded Prācīnabarhis to request
<div n="lb"/>his sons to refrain from remaining unmarried. Prācīna-
<div n="lb"/>barhis informed his sons about Brahmā's wish. They
<div n="lb"/>sat in meditation in the ocean for ten thousand years
<div n="lb"/>as per directions from their father and sang songs in
<div n="lb"/>praise of Viṣṇu. Mahāviṣṇu was pleased and he gave
<div n="lb"/>darśana (vision of god) to them on the surface of the
<div n="lb"/>ocean itself with the brilliance of blue lotus. Pracetases
<div n="lb"/>went into ecstasy when they saw Bhagavān coming to
<div n="lb"/>them riding on the back of Garuḍa and they bowed
<div n="lb"/>down in great devotion before him. Mahāviṣṇu asked
<div n="lb"/>them what they wanted and they reported they wanted
<div n="lb"/>a boon for the progress and prosperity of the prajās.
<div n="lb"/>Granting them the boon Mahāviṣṇu disappeared
<div n="lb"/>and the Pracetases went back to their father. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>14, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
