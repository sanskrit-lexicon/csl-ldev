SUŚRAVAS III¦. A spy of the Devas. He once informed
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī secretly about the penance by the Sage
<div n="lb"/>Kātyāyana. Sarasvatī appeared before the Sage and told
<div n="lb"/>him that he would get from Sage Sārasvata the know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge he wanted. Accordingly Kātyāyana ended his
<div n="lb"/>penance and went to Sage Sārasvata.
