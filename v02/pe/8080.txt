VASIṢṬHA¦. A hermit who was the son of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The three births of Vasiṣṭha.%} Vasiṣṭha with the radiance
of Brahmā, is very famous in the Purāṇas. He had three
births.
<div n="NI"/>i) {%First birth.%}
<div n="NI"/>a) {%Birth.%} Vasiṣṭha is one of the mental sons of Brahmā.
This is the first birth of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="NI"/>“Nārada was born from the lap, Dakṣa was born from
the right thumb, Vasiṣṭha from the breath (prāṇa)
Bhṛgu from the skin, Kratu from the hand of Brahmā.”
<div n="NI"/>In this birth, Arundhatī was the wife of Vasiṣṭha.
Arundhatī was known by the name Ūrjā also. There is
a Purāṇic story behind the marriage of Vasiṣṭha and
Arundhatī.
<div n="NI"/>In her previous birth the name of Arundhatī was
Sandhyā. She was born from the passion of Brahmā.
As soon as she was born she grew up. Seeing her exqui-
site beauty the Prajāpatis were filled with excitement.
Even Brahmā, her father, was some-what excited at her
sight. Śiva, who understood this, teased Brahmā.
Sandhyā was ashamed. Even after Śiva, Brahmā, Pra-
jāpatis and the others had gone their ways, she remained
there blaming her birth. She said to herself: “The mo-
ment I was born, I grew up to be a young woman. My
father and my brothers looked at me with desire. I
also looked at them excitedly. As an atonement for
this sin, I will burn my body in fire. I do not want a
body desired by my father and brothers. With this
decision she went to the mountain Candrabhāga, which
is the source of the river Candrabhāgā, and began to
perform penance. Brahmā who came to know of this,
[Page834-b+ 65]
was filled with pity and sent Vasiṣṭha to her. He went
there in the form of a Brahmin boy and taught her how
to perform penance. After the return of Vasiṣṭha she con-
tinued the severe penance to Viṣṇu. Her penance became
the subject of talk and wonder everywhere. After a short
while Viṣṇu appeared before her sitting on his convey-
ance Garuḍa. She praised Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu was pleased
with her and asked what her desire was. She said:
“Lord, creatures should not be sexually excited at their
birth. They should have sexual desire only when they
are grown up. The three worlds must know that I am
chaste. In all my births I should not look at anybody
except my husband with sexual desire. The man who
looks at me with sexual desire should lose his manliness
and become a hermaphrodite.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu agreed to her request. It was from that day
onwards that sexual desire appeared in creatures in
their grown-up stage only, after they have passed the
stages of infancy and childhood. Mahāviṣṇu told her.
“It is preordained that this body of yours will be burnt
in fire. Medhātithi, (Meghātithi), the son of Priyavrata
is performing the great sacrifice called Jyotiṣṭoma which
is to be completed in twelve years. It is coming to a
close. There is none equal to him because of this sacri-
fice. That great hermit's sacrifice is being performed in
the basin of this river Candrabhāgā. Unseen by the
hermits, you should go there and get into the fire. Be-
cause of my blessing you will be born from that fire as
the daughter of Medhātithi. You should go into the fire
thinking of him whom you want to be your husband in
this birth.”
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu touched Sandhyā with the tip of his finger.
Sandhyā walked to the sacrificial hall. Seen by none,
she got down into the fire. She was burnt in the blaz-
ing fire. By the order of Viṣṇu; the God fire placed
Sandhyā who was burnt in the sacrificial fire, in the
Solar region. The sun divided that body into two and
placed them in his chariot. The upper portion became
the prātassandhyā (dawn) between the day and the
night and the lower portion became the Sāyantana
Sandhyā (the evening twilight). At the end of the
sacrifice, from the centre of the sacrificial fire a girl,
like the flame of fire rose up. Medhātithi took that
child in his hands and called her Arundhatī. The child
became famous throughout the three worlds, as the
name stood for the principle that on no reason what-so-
ever will righteousness be obstructed. (Rodha means
obstruction. So Arundhatī is one who cannot be obstruct-
ed). In some other Purāṇas Arundhatī is given as
the daughter of Prajāpati Kardama and Devahūti.
<div n="NI"/>b) {%Marriage.%} Arundhatī grew up in the hermitage
of Medhātithi. Candrabhāgā holy bath which was the
playfield of Arundhatī, is even today, known as Arun-
dhatītīrtha. Arundhatī became five years of age. Brahmā
saw her when she was playing on the ground after hav-
ing taken her bath. At the instruction of Brahmā,
Arundhatī was entrusted to Sāvitrī and Bahulā for
education. Sāvitrī is the wife of the Sun. Arundhatī
lived in Mānasa lake with Sāvitrī, Gāyatrī, Bahulā,
Sarasvatī, Drupadā and such other celestial women
and completed her education. One day Arundhatī
happened to see Vasiṣṭha who was shining with radi-
ance. They fell in love with each other. Parents and
relatives and the elders came to know of this. Sāvitri
patting Arundhatī blessed her to become the wife of
[Page835-a+ 64]
Vasiṣṭha. The marriage of Arundhatī with Vasiṣṭha was
conducted in the presence of the Gods.
<div n="NI"/>c) {%Sons.%} Seven sons, named Citraketu, Purocis, Viraca,
Mitra, Ulbaṇa, Vasubhṛdyāna and Dyumān were born
to Vasiṣṭha by Arundhatī. All the seven of them were
Brahmarṣis.
<div n="NI"/>{%d) The meaning of the names Vasiṣṭha and Arundhatī.%} The
meaning of the name Vasiṣṭha is given by Vasiṣṭha
himself as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>I am known as Vasiṣṭha for two reasons. I am ‘Vasu-
mān’. The Śrutis say that Air, Earth etc. are Vasus.
I have become Vasiṣṭha because I have brought under
control the Vasus beginning with Aṇimā (the power
of reducing the body to an atom). See what Arun-
dhatī herself says, about the meaning of the name
Arundhatī.
<div n="NI"/>“I consider mountains, earth and heaven as elements
in which I live, only after considering my hus-
band as the element in which I live. My husband
is the first and foremost element in my life. Moreover
I conform (anurodha) with the mind of my husband.
So know me as Arundhatī.”
<div n="NI"/>{%e) Conjugal fidelity of Arundhatī.%} The Saptarṣis (the seven
hermits) once left Arundhatī alone in a forest and went
to the Mountain Himālayas to gather fruits and roots.
In those days, due to severe summer, the earth
became a wilderness. So the hermits lived in the
Himālayas. Arundhatī all alone did penance in the
forest. On one day Śiva took the form of a Brahmin and
going near Arundhatī requested her for alms. She rep-
lied: “There are only Ziziphus fruits here, and nothing
else to eat.” The Brahmin asked her to boil them. She
placed the pot of Ziziphus fruits on the oven and sat
there hearing the good stories told by the Brahmin. Thus
without thinking about her hunger or thirst she sat there
for twelve years hearing the stories narrated by the
Brahmin. When the hermits returned from Himālayas,
Śiva assumed his original form and said, “Hermits!
This woman, sitting in the hermitage, has acquired
more penance than you have acquired in the Himālayas.
Good woman! What boon do you want?” She
requested that that place should be known as the holy
place called ‘Badarapacana (cooking of Ziziphus fruits).
Śiva allowed it. Even today that place is considered
a holy place.
<div n="NI"/>f) {%Death.%} When so many devas were dead at the sacri-
fice of Dakṣa, Vasiṣṭha also died along with them.
Arundhatī followed her husband. After death both of
them entered the firmament and became two stars.
<div n="NI"/>g) {%Seeing Arundhatī.%} In India there is a custom of show-
ing the women, the star Arundhatī. Arundhatī is the
first of the women who took only one husband in her life.
The meaning of this custom is this that this mentality of
Arundhatī should be acquired by the married women
of India. Moreover, if the star stands in front of the star
Vasiṣṭha, it is considered to forebode calamities in the
world. (Kālikā Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%Second birth.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%General information.%} Vasiṣṭha who died at the sacrifice
of Dakṣa took birth again from the sacrificial fire of
Brahmā. Akṣamālā was the wife of this Vasiṣṭha.
Akṣamālā was the rebirth of Arundhatī. So, in some
Purāṇas, both are shown as one. This birth of Vasiṣ-
ṭha was terminated by the curse of emperor Nimi of
[Page835-b+ 65]
the Ikṣvāku dynasty. (For details see under Nimi).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Third birth.%} In the third birth Vasiṣṭha was born
from a pot as the son of Mitrāvaruṇas. In this birth
Vasiṣṭha was the brother of Agastya. (For detailed
story see under Agastya, para 2). In this birth the
wife of Vasiṣṭha was an Arundhatī, who was the sister
of Nārada. Thus according to the Purāṇas, it took
three births for Vasiṣṭha to complete his life. It is
difficult to ascertain, in which particular birth, a parti-
cular story, stated in the Purāṇas, took place. It is
probable that a large number of episodes might have
taken place in the second and third births.
<div n="NI"/>Stories connected with the life of Vasiṣṭha are given
below:
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra.%} Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra
were two hermits who quarrelled with each other through-
out their lives. The quarrel between Vasiṣṭha a
Brahmin hermit and Viśvāmitra a royal hermit, is
given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Reason for the enmity.%} Viśvāmitra was a King who
cared much for the welfare of his subjects. Once he
went with his army to hunt. He became tired by the
hunt and reached the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha who
welcomed them with hospitality. He told them that
food would be ready when they returned after a bath.
The King and his men bathed quickly and when they
returned, a grand feast was ready for so many thou-
sands. The King was in great perplexity. After the
meals Viśvāmitra approached the hermit Vasiṣṭha
and asked him how he got such a grand feast ready.
He replied that the cow Kāmadhenu in his hermitage was
capable of granting any wish. The king desired to have
the cow. He asked the hermit to exchange the cow for
a crore of ordinary cows. Vasiṣṭha did not agree to
this. Viśvāmitra said that the noble and superior
things of the country belonged to the King. The hermit
did not agree to that also. Finally Viśvāmitra was
about to take away the cow by force. Thus the quarrel
began. Understanding the wish of Vasiṣṭha Kāmadhenu
held her horns and tail up and stood as a fierce
and cruel figure. From the various limbs of the cow so
many thousands of warriors jumped out and a fierce
battle ensued in which the hundred sons and the huge
army of Viśvāmitra met with defeat. At last Viśvāmitra
tried to launch a direct attack against Vasiṣṭha. But
the arrows of Viśvāmitra were changed to flowers when
they touched the body of Vasiṣṭha. At last the King
admitted that the power of the penance of a Brahmin
hermit was the real power and he admitted defeat from
Vasiṣṭha. From that day onwards a deep-rooted,
hatred against Vasiṣṭha arose in the heart of Viśvāmitra.
He left the administration of his Kingdom in the hands
of his relatives and went to the south where he erected
a hermitage and began to do severe penance. He acquir-
ed great powers of penance and became a royal hermit
of immense attainments and the quarrel between the
two great hermits Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra began.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 5 sargas from 51).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Second confrontation.%} The next contest between the two
hermits was due to the king Triśaṅku of the Solar
dynasty. Triśaṅku wanted bodily attainment of heaven.
Vasiṣṭha tried to discourage the king. Viśvāmitra took
up the matter. He began to perform a sacrifice to lift
up the king bodily to heaven, and Triśaṅku began to
rise up higher and higher. But Indra did not allow him
[Page836-a+ 65]
to enter bodily into the heaven. At last Viśvāmitra, by
the power of his penance created an artificial heaven
midway between the heaven and the earth and placed
Triśaṅku in that heaven. With this the gap between
the two hermits widened. (For more details see under
Triśaṅku).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Third confrontation.%} By the blessing of Varuṇa, a son
named Lohita was born to Hariścandra. He had promis-
ed Varuṇa to sacrifice his son Lohita. But Lohita
came to know of this and he left the palace. Hariścan-
dra was in a difficult situation. Vasiṣṭha advised him
to buy a son and to sacrifice him. Accordingly a Brah-
min boy named Śunaśśepha was bought. Vasiṣṭha
decided to sacrifice him. Viśvāmitra said that he could
not be sacrificed. Hariścandra was loved by Vasiṣṭha.
So Viśvāmitra tried to harm him as far as possible.
Hariścandra fell in the trap of Vīśvāmitra and lost his
country, city, wife, everything and had to live in funeral
places. (For detailed story see under Hariścandra.)
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Fourth confrontation.%} Vasiṣṭha did not like the
deception practised by Viśvāmitra, on Hariścandra.
Once Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha met in the forest by
chance. Vasiṣṭha scolded Viśvāmitra, who had only
the guise of a hermit, thus: “You wicked Viśvāmitra!
Why do you put the truthful Hariścandra into so much
misery? You are deceiving him as the stork sits in
meditation and deceives the fish. So you will become
a stork.”
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra looked at the hermit Vasiṣṭha who had
cursed him and said. “So long as I am a stork you
shall be Kingfisher. Thus they cursed each other.
<div n="NI"/>Both of them became birds and went to the shore of
Mānasa lake and each building a nest on the top of
trees began to live there. There was nothing but quar-
rel between the two birds daily. Both pecked and
scratched each other to such an extent that they were
covered with bleeding wounds. They looked like an
Erythrina tree filled with flowers. Everybody who saw
them was filled with sadness. Thus they lived there
for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>Once the Kind-hearted Brahmā, the father of Vasiṣṭha,
saw their sorry plight. Having pity on them he came
there with the other gods and delivered them both
from the curse. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 6).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Fifth confrontation.%} Viśvāmitra called the river
Sarasvatī and asked her to bring Vasiṣṭha along with
her current. Sarasvatī did not like the idea. Still,
fearing the curse of Viśvāmitra she agreed to do so. The
river-basin where Vasiṣṭha had been performing penance
was pulled down by the current of the river, and taking
Vasiṣṭha in the current carried him down. Sarasvatī
did not wish to leave Vasiṣṭha at the mercy of Viśvā-
mitra. So when they reached the door of the hermitage
of Viśvāmitra, she carried him further down in a swift
current. Viśvāmitra got angry and cursed Sarasvatī.
“Let blood flow through the river.” With that the
water of Sarasvatī changed to blood-colour. The gods
were perplexed at this. They all gathered on the banks of
the river. In the presence of the gods, both the hermits
came to a compromise. Thenceforward that place
became a holy tīrtha under the name Vasiṣṭhāpavāha.
(M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 42).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Vasiṣṭha changed Ilā a woman, into a man.
(For details see under Ilā I).
[Page836-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Wives and children. Seven sons Rajas, Gotra,
Ūrdhvabāhu, Savana, Anagha, Sutapas and Śukra,
were born to Vasiṣṭha by his wife Ūrjā. These
seven pure and just persons were the Saptarṣis
(seven hermits) in the first Manvantara. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Aṃśa I, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>(Rāja, Gātra, Ūrdhvabāhu Savana, Alaghu, Śukra (and

in Ṛgveda, of which the seventh Maṇḍala was composed
by the sages of Vasiṣṭha's hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>(v) Cursing Rāvaṇa. Once Rāvaṇa asked Vasiṣṭha to
come as his teacher and teach him the Vedas and the
other scriptures. Vasiṣṭha did not comply with his
request. The angry Rāvaṇa got Vasiṣṭha a captive. But
the King Kuvalayāśva of the Solar dynasty, liberated
Vasiṣṭha from captivity. The rescued Vasiṣṭha cursed
Rāvaṇa. You and your family will be exterminated by
those born of the Solar dynasty.” (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
