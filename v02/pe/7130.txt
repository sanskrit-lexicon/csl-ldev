SUNANDA II¦. Son of King Pradyota. The epic story
in Bhaviṣya Purāṇa closes with the story of Sunanda.
The Maharṣis, who lived in Naimiṣa forest feared that
following the death of Sunanda, the world would
become absolutely mean and base, and all of them,
therefore, went to the Himālayas and there, at Viśā-
lanagara recited the Viṣṇu Purāṇa. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa,
Pratisarga Saṃhitā).
