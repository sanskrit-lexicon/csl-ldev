DEVADATTA II¦. A king of ancient India, son of King
<div n="lb"/>Jayadatta. Jayadatta wanted to marry his son Devadatta
<div n="lb"/>to the daughter of a Vaiśya in Pāṭalīputra. Though it
[Page209-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was a far cry from Pāṭalīputra to Jayadatta's court the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya married his daughter to the prince as he attached
<div n="lb"/>much importance to such an alliance with the King.
<div n="lb"/>From the dowry given by the Vaiśya to his daughter
<div n="lb"/>the resources of her father appeared to be very meagre
<div n="lb"/>to Devadatta.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Devadatta's wife returned to her house
<div n="lb"/>with the permission of her husband. During her absence
<div n="lb"/>Jayadatta expired, enemies attacked his kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>Devadatta with his mother ran away from his kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>Sometime after that he started for his wife's house. But,
<div n="lb"/>feeling that it would not be proper for him to personally
<div n="lb"/>tell his father-in-law about what had happened to him
<div n="lb"/>he waited outside an inn near his wife's house, and he
<div n="lb"/>had not waited there for long when he saw a woman
<div n="lb"/>descending by a cord from the other door of the house.
<div n="lb"/>He felt deeply mortified to detect that it was his wife
<div n="lb"/>who was thus descending. And, when she, not recognis-
<div n="lb"/>ing Devadatta in his dirty clothes, asked him who he
<div n="lb"/>was, he answered a ‘traveller’. Taking no notice of this
<div n="lb"/>‘traveller’ she got into the inn, and Devadatta followed
<div n="lb"/>her. Inside the inn she was met by a man who beat her
<div n="lb"/>for being late to go to him; but, in spite of the beating
<div n="lb"/>she pleased him with coy words. Then and there Deva-
<div n="lb"/>datta divorced her in his mind, but remained there
<div n="lb"/>observing their love-making. In the course of their love-
<div n="lb"/>play an ear-ring studded with costly gems rolled down
<div n="lb"/>the floor from her ears, but she did not notice it. She
<div n="lb"/>parted from her paramour before dawn. Devadatta
<div n="lb"/>went to Kānyakubja with the ear-ring, and there he
<div n="lb"/>pledged it for one lakh sovereigns with which money he
<div n="lb"/>collected an army and conquered back his lost kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>Then he redeemed the pledge and sent the ear-ring to
<div n="lb"/>his father-in-law. The whole incident became public.
<div n="lb"/>When she realised the fact that the stranger whom she
<div n="lb"/>had met at the inn was her own husband, Devadatta's
<div n="lb"/>wife felt so deeply hurt and humiliated that her heart was
<div n="lb"/>broken and she died. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Naravāhana-
<div n="lb"/>datta Janana, Taraṅga 1).
