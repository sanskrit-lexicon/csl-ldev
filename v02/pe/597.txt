ATHARVA¦(M). Among the Vedas, this has the fourth
place. It comprises different kinds of incantations of
occult powers for the destruction of enemies. Atharvan
the son of Vasiṣṭha was the author of this Veda. In
Chapter 6 of the third section of Viṣṇu Purāṇa the
following reference is made to Atharvaveda: “Sumantu
Maharṣi who was of infinite glory, first taught this
Atharvaveda to his disciple Kabandha. (Sumantu
Maharṣi was the son of Jaimini, who was the disciple
of Vedavyāsa). Kabandha divided Atharvaveda into
two parts and communicated them to two Maharṣis
named Devadarśa and Pathya. Devadarśa's disciples
were: Medhā, Brahmabali, Śautkāyani and Pippalāda.
Pathya had three disciples named Jābāli, Kumudādi
and Śaunaka. They also made Atharvaveda compila-
tions. Śaunaka divided his compilation into two and
gave one part to Babhru and the other to Saindhava.
Muñjikeśa learnt it from Saindhava and divided the
compilation first into two and later into three parts.
The five divisions of the Atharvaveda—Nakṣatrakalpa,
Vedakalpa, Saṃhitākalpa, Āṅgirasakalpa and Śānti-
kalpa, were made by Muñjikeśa. Nakṣatrakalpa con-
tains Brahma's works: Saṃhitākalpa contains Mantra
Vidhi; Āngirasakalpa contains ābhicāra and Śāntikalpa
contains taming of horses, elephants etc.
