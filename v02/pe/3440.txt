KAUSTUBHA¦. A brilliant precious stone. It is mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 3; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa Sarga 45, Stanza 39 and Mahābhārata, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva that this precious stone floated up at the time of
<div n="lb"/>the churning of the sea of Milk. This jewel which
<div n="lb"/>originated from the ghee in the sea of Milk, was worn
<div n="lb"/>on the breast by Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>“This divine jewel called Kaustubha came up in the
<div n="lb"/>middle of ghee and stayed in the breast of Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>spreading its rays everywhere.” (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 18, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>KAUTHUMI. Son of a Brahmin named Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>nābha. Once this Brahmin youth went to the hermitage
<div n="lb"/>of King Janaka and entered into a controversy with the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins there. In the argument Kauthumi became
<div n="lb"/>angry and killed a Brahmin. From that day he became
<div n="lb"/>a leper. The sin of Brahmahatyā (murder of Brahmin)
<div n="lb"/>also followed him. Finally according to the advice of
<div n="lb"/>his father he worshipped the sun God, with Śrāvya-
<div n="lb"/>saṃjñakasūkta (a spell or incantation) and by the
<div n="lb"/>blessing of the Sun God he got deliverance from the
<div n="lb"/>sin of Brahmahatyā and the disease of leprosy. (Bhavi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣya Purāṇa, Brāhma Parva).
