INDIA¦. ‘South Śarakh’, a newspaper published from
the United Arab Republic with the assistance of the
Indian Embassy gives the following account of how the
land originally known as ‘Bhārata’ came to be called
India. The name ‘India’ was given to “Bhārata” by
the Arabs. Even from very early times, Arabs used to
give the name ‘Hind’ to their girls. In ancient Arabic
love poems, this name could be seen very frequently.
There were commercial and cultural contacts between
Bhārata and Arab lands, from very old times. The
words ‘Kharan Fūl’ (spices) ‘Pulfūl’ (Pepper) etc.
may be seen in Arabic poems of the pre-Islamic period.
These contacts became more intimate in later years and
the Arabs began to take very great interest in the pro-
ducts and the people of this country. They began to
call ‘Bhārata’ by the pet name ‘Hind’ which they
used for their little children. They began to use the
term ‘Al Hind’ when referring to Bhārata in their
poems, records and trade agreements In course of time
this was shortened to ‘Hind’ and finally became
‘INDIA’.
