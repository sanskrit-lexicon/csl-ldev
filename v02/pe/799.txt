ĀTREYA¦. A sage. This sage had acquired the power
to go from one planet to another. Once this ṛṣi went
to devaloka as the guest of Indra and there he drank
Amṛta (the celestial elixir) and enjoyed the dances of
the celestial maidens A desire to have a similar heaven
of his own budded in his mind and he approached
Viśvakarmā who gave him a new heaven of his own.
But before long the demons took over this heaven
from him. Though Viśvakarmā took back the same
from the demons, Ātreya did not go back but returned
to his old āśrama on the banks of Gomatī and doing
penance there for a long time attained salvation
(Brahma Purāṇa).
