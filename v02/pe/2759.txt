INDRAJIT¦. Rāvaṇa's son, Meghanāda.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Viṣṇu,—
Brahmā—Pulastya—Viśravas—Rāvaṇa—Meghanāda
(Indrajit).
<div n="NI"/>To Pulastya, one of the Prajāpatis was born by
Mālinī, Viśravas. Viśravas had two wives, Devavarṇinī,
also called Ilibilā and Kaikasī. Vaiśravaṇa or Kubera
was his son by Ilibilā and Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa,
Vibhīṣaṇa and Śūrpaṇakhā (daughter) being the
offsprings of Kaikasī. Rāvaṇa married Mandodarī and
three sons, Meghanāda, Atikāya and Akṣakumāra were
born to them. Meghanāda came to be known as Indra-
jit also, because he had defeated Indra once.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Son of Śiva.%} Though it was Mandodarī, Rāvaṇa's
wife, who gave birth to Meghanāda (Indrajit) the
Uttararāmāyaṇa refers to him as the son of Śiva in a
story as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once, after religious fasting and other rites on a
Monday (to propitiate the Sun-God) Madhurā, an
Apsarā woman, adorned with all kinds of ornaments
went to Mount Kailāsa to offer salutations to Lord
Śiva. Pārvatī, Śiva's consort was not present then,
and Madhurā used the opportunity to please the
Lord, and she got pregnant by him. All on a sudden
Pārvatī appeared on the scene, and knowing what
had happened in her absence she cursed Madhurā to
fall into an abandoned well as a frog. Madhurā
prayed for redemption from the curśe, and Śiva pity-
ing her sad plight blessed her that after 12 years she
would get herself transformed into a fair damsel and
become the daughter of Maya and would, then, be
married by a great King. According to Pārvatī's curse
Madhurā fell into a well in the forest as a frog. Mayā-
sura was performing penance near the well to get a
daughter. On the expiry of 12 years after Madhurā
fell into the well as a frog, Mayāsura looked into it
and beheld a beautiful girl. He took her to his palace
named her Mandodarī and brought her up as his own
daughter. Rāvaṇa married her. It was at this stage
that Śiva's vital fluid which had, twelve years before,
entered her womb made its appearance in the form
of a son. Rāvaṇa named him Meghanāda. Being Śiva's
son he grew up with great prowess. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Meghanāda's yajñas.%} When once Rāvaṇa was
away from Laṅkā on a conquest of the world, Megha-
nāda went to Nikumbhilā, the central place for con-
ducting yajñas, and performed seven yajñas with sage
Śukra as the chief priest. By the time all the seven
yajñas, viz. Agniṣṭoma, Aśvamedha, Bahusvarṇa,
Vaiṣṇava, Māheśvara, Rājasūya and Gosava were
over, Rāvaṇa returned to Laṅkā and sage Śukra
gave him details about the yajñas conducted by his
son Meghanāda. Rāvaṇa did not like the Vaiṣṇava
yāga performed by his son, and Śukra, who got angry
at this cursed, Rāvaṇa that he would meet with his
death at the hands of Viṣṇu. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>By performing a Śaiva yāga, Meghanāda got the bless-
ings of Śiva, who taught him (Meghanāda) the great
art of Samādhi, which helped one to move amongst
others invisible to them.

<div n="NI"/>4) {%The name, Indrajit.%} Once Rāvaṇa encircled Indra-
loka with a big army, and Indra, very much alarmed
ran up to Viṣṇu for protection. Viṣṇu told Indra that
it was not yet time for Rāvaṇa's death and when it
was time Viṣṇu himself would slay him. Disappointed
at this Indra returned, and a fierce war ensued between
him and Rāvaṇa. Indra fought with Rāvaṇa, and
Jayanta, his son fought with Meghanāda. When fight-
ing reached its climax Meghanāda resorted to the
art of Samādhi taught by Śiva, and became invisible
to others. Then he showered his arrows. Jayanta
fainted on the battlefield. Pulomā, father of Indrāṇī,
carried away Jayanta without others knowing and
concealed him in the ocean. Everyone thought that
Jayanta was dead. Burning with grief and revenge
Indra confronted Rāvaṇa again. Rāvaṇa fell down at
the blow with Indra's vajra (thunderbolt). Then once
more making himself invisible to others, Meghanāda
jumped into Indra's chariot and bound him prisoner.
By that time Rāvaṇa got up on his feet, and he and
Meghanāda carried away Indra to Laṅkā and chained
him to the foot of the flagstaff.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas, grief-stricken at this sad fate of Indra
went to Brahmā and submitted their grievance.
Brahmā reached Laṅkā, and named Meghanāda Indra-
jit. (He who gained victory over Indra). Indrajit
prayed to Brahmā for the boon, which would ward
off death for ever. When Brahmā told him that the
boon of eternal deathlessness was out of the question
he sought the following boon: that when he had per-
formed a yajña, out of the sacrificial fire should emerge
a chariot and necessary horses and that he should not
be killed by any one while fighting from that chariot,
and that he did not mind being killed by enemies if
he got away without completing the yajña. Brahmā
granted him the boon. And, as directed by Brahmā
Rāvaṇa released Indra from imprisonment after one
year. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Indrajit and Hanūmān.%} A clash occurred between
Indrajit and Hanūmān, who landed in Laṅkā in search
of Sītā, and the former got Hanūmān bound by
Brahmāstra. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Death of Indrajit.%} At the height of the fierce war
between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, Indrajit and Lakṣmaṇa
clashed with each other. Finding victory impossible
Indrajit created a fake Sītā and killed her. Thinking
that Sītā was dead, grief-stricken Hanūmān, Lakṣmaṇa
and the regiment of monkeys withdrew from the
fight. Informed of Sītā's death Rāma fainted.
<div n="NI"/>Indrajit began the yajña for victory over Rāma at the
place called Nikumbhilā. Vibhīṣaṇa told Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa about the warning of Brahmā that Indra-
jit would be killed if the yajña was obstructed. Happy
at the information Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa immediately
went to Nikumbhilā to fight with Indrajit who was
engaged in performing the yajña, and without complet-
ing the yajña he came out and began fighting, and
Lakṣmaṇa killed him. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
Kāṇḍa, Chapters 82-91).
