VIGRAHA III¦. (Image).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} God, who is not discernible to
the outward senses, is given embodiment and consecrat-
ed in places of worship by people. These figures are
called Vigrahas (idols or images). People worship
Śālagrāma, (a kind of ammonite found in the river
Gaṇḍakī), Bāṇaliṅga (Phallus), mystical diagrams,
animals, birds, trees, rivers, lakes, places of death etc.
and so many other things.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The different kinds of Vigrahas.%} Vigrahas are of three
groups. They are:-(1) Mysterious (2) Evident-mysteri-
ous (3) Evident. Śālagrāma, Phallus etc. belong to the
group mysterious. The Mukhaliṅga, considered to be
the image of Trimūrti (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva) in the
Elephanta cave, belongs to the group Evident. The
image of Phallus is Evident-mysterious. In the first,
there is no form or figure. In the second there are parts
of the figure. The image which shows the entire figure
is Evident.
<div n="NI"/>Some gods and goddesses possess two appearances,
peaceful and fierce. Those who wish to succeed in
performing cruel deeds and to vanquish enemies, wor-
ship fierce gods whereas those who wish for peace,
worship peaceful Gods. Viśvarūpa, (assuming all
shapes), Narasiṃha (the man-lion), Vaṭapatraśāyī (as
lying on banyan-leaf) and Paraśurāma are fierce forms
of Viṣṇu. Destroying Kāma (cupid) Gaja and Tripura
are fierce forms of Śiva worshipped by some people.
Generally temples with images in this form are erected
outside the village or city.
<div n="NI"/>Owing to the differences, in the making and the mater-
ials used, the images are divided into three groups.
[Page852-a+ 64]
They are portraits, Half-portraits and corrupted
portraits. The whole of the figure will be made in
(portraits) citras. In half-citras only the front view
will be completed. Corrupted Citras are images done
on the wall or rock.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Main images.%} Main images are mostly Śaivite or
Vaiṣṇavite. There will be one or two other images.
Worship of Devī (Goddess) is one of them. The Śaivi-
tes will worship Pārvatī also after Śiva and the Vaiṣṇa-
vites Mahālakṣmī also after Viṣṇu In South India the
worshippers are Śaivites and Vaiṣṇavites.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śaivites.%} In India a large number of people worship
Śiva. There is not much difference in the mode of wor-
ship of these various people. There are worships which
are in accordance with the Vedas and which are not.
Forms of worship which are Sāttvika (of goodness) and
which are not, could be seen. The Śaiva worship called
Paraśupada is very ancient. The phallus at Guḍimalla
is considered to be as old as B.C. 2nd century. From
this it could be inferred how old, the Śaivite worship is
in India.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The Śaivite images.%} Of the emblems denoting Śiva,
the most important is the Phallus, which is of two kinds,
movable and immovable. Risen by itself and or erected
and set firm and consecrated inside temples are immov-
able; that which is made of earth, metal, jewel, wood
or stone, is movable. There are Phalluses made for the
time being. They are fixed on platforms or pedestals.
They are of different sizes and shapes. The Phallus is
made of male stone and the pedestal of female stone.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The portions of Śiva.%} There are various kinds of images
meant to reveal various attributes of Śiva. Liṅgodbhava
(originated from Phallus), Candraśekhara, Raudra,
Umāsaṃhita (with Umā) etc. are some of them. Kāmā-
ntaka (killing Kāma or Cupid), Gajāri (enemy of Gaja),
Kālāri (Enemy of Yama) and Tripuradāhaka (burn-
ing Tripura) are figures of extermination. Śiva has
the figures of blessing Caṇḍeśa, Viṣṇu, Nandīśvara,
Vighneśa and Arjuna also. There are a large number
of images in various dancing poses.
<div n="NI"/>There are four other figures of Dakṣiṇāmūrti, such as the
explanation, knowledge, yoga (or meditation, contem-
plation and other ways of union with the Universal
Soul) and Vīṇādhara (carrying a lute). A few other
forms are Bhikṣāṭaka (begging alms), Kapāladhārī
(wearing skulls), Gaṅgādhara (bearing the Gaṅges),
Ardhanārīśvara (God half of whom is a woman),
Vṛṣabhavāhana (seated on a bull), Viṣabhakṣaka (eat-
ing poison) etc. The figures of Sadāśiva, Maheśa,
Ekādaśarudras (eleven Rudras), Vidyeśvara and Mūrt-
yaṣṭaka are seen occasionally here and there. There
are scriptures describing these figures.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The Devas (gods) connected with Śiva.%} Among the gods
connected with Śiva, first place is given to Gaṇapati.
Worship of Gaṇapati was in vogue from 6th or 7th
century B.C. Perhaps the images that we see today
were made after this period.
<div n="NI"/>In South India temples dedicated to Gaṇapati are not
scarce. The position of Gaṇapati is at the entrance of
villages and fortresses, at the foot of banyan trees, at
the entrance of temples and at the south-west corner of
Śaivite temples.
<div n="NI"/>There are images of Gaṇapati in the postures of stand-
ing and dancing. Main images are those with the trunk
[Page852-b+ 65]
turned to the right and to the left. The trunk is turned
to the right in some and to the left in others.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Subrahmaṇya.%} Subrahmaṇya is worshipped only in
South India. Subrahmaṇya is known by various names
such as Kumāra, Muruka, Kārttikeya, Skanda, Ārumu-
kha, Guha, and so on. Temples dedicated to Subrah-
maṇya are seen in plenty in Tamil Nadu. They are all
situated on the tops of hills.
<div n="NI"/>There is sufficient proof in the poetic works of the
Saṅgha period, to the fact that Subrahmaṇya-worship
was prevalent in South India. On excavation at the
place Nāgārjunakoṇḍa in the District of Guntur, images
of Subrahmaṇya were found under the earth. They
were as old as 3rd century B.C.
<div n="NI"/>Images of Subrahmaṇya are seen in various postures
and shapes such as sitting, with six faces, with one face,
with two hands, with four hands, sometimes with wife,
in the state of having finished investiture with the
Brahma-string etc. There are figures sitting on the pea-
cock also.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other images.%} Images of Śakti, Lakṣmī, Earth-goddess,
Sarasvatī, Saptamātṛs (Seven Mothers), Jyeṣṭhā, Viṣṇu,
the ten incarnations, the planets such as the sun etc.
the deities of the weapon like the thunderbolt, Śakti
(lance), Nandikeśvara, Caṇḍeśvara, Śāstā, Kṣetrapāla,
Brahmā, Guardians of the zones, Aśvinīdevas, half gods,
etc. are also dedicated and worshipped in temples.
