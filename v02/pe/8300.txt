VIGRAHA III¦. (Image).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} God, who is not discernible to
<div n="lb"/>the outward senses, is given embodiment and consecrat-
<div n="lb"/>ed in places of worship by people. These figures are
<div n="lb"/>called Vigrahas (idols or images). People worship
<div n="lb"/>Śālagrāma, (a kind of ammonite found in the river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍakī), Bāṇaliṅga (Phallus), mystical diagrams,
<div n="lb"/>animals, birds, trees, rivers, lakes, places of death etc.
<div n="lb"/>and so many other things.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The different kinds of Vigrahas.%} Vigrahas are of three
<div n="lb"/>groups. They are:-(1) Mysterious (2) Evident-mysteri-
<div n="lb"/>ous (3) Evident. Śālagrāma, Phallus etc. belong to the
<div n="lb"/>group mysterious. The Mukhaliṅga, considered to be
<div n="lb"/>the image of Trimūrti (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva) in the
<div n="lb"/>Elephanta cave, belongs to the group Evident. The
<div n="lb"/>image of Phallus is Evident-mysterious. In the first,
<div n="lb"/>there is no form or figure. In the second there are parts
<div n="lb"/>of the figure. The image which shows the entire figure
<div n="lb"/>is Evident.
<div n="NI"/>Some gods and goddesses possess two appearances,
<div n="lb"/>peaceful and fierce. Those who wish to succeed in
<div n="lb"/>performing cruel deeds and to vanquish enemies, wor-
<div n="lb"/>ship fierce gods whereas those who wish for peace,
<div n="lb"/>worship peaceful Gods. Viśvarūpa, (assuming all
<div n="lb"/>shapes), Narasiṃha (the man-lion), Vaṭapatraśāyī (as
<div n="lb"/>lying on banyan-leaf) and Paraśurāma are fierce forms
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu. Destroying Kāma (cupid) Gaja and Tripura
<div n="lb"/>are fierce forms of Śiva worshipped by some people.
<div n="lb"/>Generally temples with images in this form are erected
<div n="lb"/>outside the village or city.
<div n="NI"/>Owing to the differences, in the making and the mater-
<div n="lb"/>ials used, the images are divided into three groups.
[Page852-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>They are portraits, Half-portraits and corrupted
<div n="lb"/>portraits. The whole of the figure will be made in
<div n="lb"/>(portraits) citras. In half-citras only the front view
<div n="lb"/>will be completed. Corrupted Citras are images done
<div n="lb"/>on the wall or rock.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Main images.%} Main images are mostly Śaivite or
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavite. There will be one or two other images.
<div n="lb"/>Worship of Devī (Goddess) is one of them. The Śaivi-
<div n="lb"/>tes will worship Pārvatī also after Śiva and the Vaiṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vites Mahālakṣmī also after Viṣṇu In South India the
<div n="lb"/>worshippers are Śaivites and Vaiṣṇavites.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śaivites.%} In India a large number of people worship
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. There is not much difference in the mode of wor-
<div n="lb"/>ship of these various people. There are worships which
<div n="lb"/>are in accordance with the Vedas and which are not.
<div n="lb"/>Forms of worship which are Sāttvika (of goodness) and
<div n="lb"/>which are not, could be seen. The Śaiva worship called
<div n="lb"/>Paraśupada is very ancient. The phallus at Guḍimalla
<div n="lb"/>is considered to be as old as B.C. 2nd century. From
<div n="lb"/>this it could be inferred how old, the Śaivite worship is
<div n="lb"/>in India.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The Śaivite images.%} Of the emblems denoting Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>the most important is the Phallus, which is of two kinds,
<div n="lb"/>movable and immovable. Risen by itself and or erected
<div n="lb"/>and set firm and consecrated inside temples are immov-
<div n="lb"/>able; that which is made of earth, metal, jewel, wood
<div n="lb"/>or stone, is movable. There are Phalluses made for the
<div n="lb"/>time being. They are fixed on platforms or pedestals.
<div n="lb"/>They are of different sizes and shapes. The Phallus is
<div n="lb"/>made of male stone and the pedestal of female stone.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The portions of Śiva.%} There are various kinds of images
<div n="lb"/>meant to reveal various attributes of Śiva. Liṅgodbhava
<div n="lb"/>(originated from Phallus), Candraśekhara, Raudra,
<div n="lb"/>Umāsaṃhita (with Umā) etc. are some of them. Kāmā-
<div n="lb"/>ntaka (killing Kāma or Cupid), Gajāri (enemy of Gaja),
<div n="lb"/>Kālāri (Enemy of Yama) and Tripuradāhaka (burn-
<div n="lb"/>ing Tripura) are figures of extermination. Śiva has
<div n="lb"/>the figures of blessing Caṇḍeśa, Viṣṇu, Nandīśvara,
<div n="lb"/>Vighneśa and Arjuna also. There are a large number
<div n="lb"/>of images in various dancing poses.
<div n="NI"/>There are four other figures of Dakṣiṇāmūrti, such as the
<div n="lb"/>explanation, knowledge, yoga (or meditation, contem-
<div n="lb"/>plation and other ways of union with the Universal
<div n="lb"/>Soul) and Vīṇādhara (carrying a lute). A few other
<div n="lb"/>forms are Bhikṣāṭaka (begging alms), Kapāladhārī
<div n="lb"/>(wearing skulls), Gaṅgādhara (bearing the Gaṅges),
<div n="lb"/>Ardhanārīśvara (God half of whom is a woman),
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣabhavāhana (seated on a bull), Viṣabhakṣaka (eat-
<div n="lb"/>ing poison) etc. The figures of Sadāśiva, Maheśa,
<div n="lb"/>Ekādaśarudras (eleven Rudras), Vidyeśvara and Mūrt-
<div n="lb"/>yaṣṭaka are seen occasionally here and there. There
<div n="lb"/>are scriptures describing these figures.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The Devas (gods) connected with Śiva.%} Among the gods
<div n="lb"/>connected with Śiva, first place is given to Gaṇapati.
<div n="lb"/>Worship of Gaṇapati was in vogue from 6th or 7th
<div n="lb"/>century B.C. Perhaps the images that we see today
<div n="lb"/>were made after this period.
<div n="NI"/>In South India temples dedicated to Gaṇapati are not
<div n="lb"/>scarce. The position of Gaṇapati is at the entrance of
<div n="lb"/>villages and fortresses, at the foot of banyan trees, at
<div n="lb"/>the entrance of temples and at the south-west corner of
<div n="lb"/>Śaivite temples.
<div n="NI"/>There are images of Gaṇapati in the postures of stand-
<div n="lb"/>ing and dancing. Main images are those with the trunk
[Page852-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>turned to the right and to the left. The trunk is turned
<div n="lb"/>to the right in some and to the left in others.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Subrahmaṇya.%} Subrahmaṇya is worshipped only in
<div n="lb"/>South India. Subrahmaṇya is known by various names
<div n="lb"/>such as Kumāra, Muruka, Kārttikeya, Skanda, Ārumu-
<div n="lb"/>kha, Guha, and so on. Temples dedicated to Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya are seen in plenty in Tamil Nadu. They are all
<div n="lb"/>situated on the tops of hills.
<div n="NI"/>There is sufficient proof in the poetic works of the
<div n="lb"/>Saṅgha period, to the fact that Subrahmaṇya-worship
<div n="lb"/>was prevalent in South India. On excavation at the
<div n="lb"/>place Nāgārjunakoṇḍa in the District of Guntur, images
<div n="lb"/>of Subrahmaṇya were found under the earth. They
<div n="lb"/>were as old as 3rd century B.C.
<div n="NI"/>Images of Subrahmaṇya are seen in various postures
<div n="lb"/>and shapes such as sitting, with six faces, with one face,
<div n="lb"/>with two hands, with four hands, sometimes with wife,
<div n="lb"/>in the state of having finished investiture with the
<div n="lb"/>Brahma-string etc. There are figures sitting on the pea-
<div n="lb"/>cock also.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other images.%} Images of Śakti, Lakṣmī, Earth-goddess,
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī, Saptamātṛs (Seven Mothers), Jyeṣṭhā, Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>the ten incarnations, the planets such as the sun etc.
<div n="lb"/>the deities of the weapon like the thunderbolt, Śakti
<div n="lb"/>(lance), Nandikeśvara, Caṇḍeśvara, Śāstā, Kṣetrapāla,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Guardians of the zones, Aśvinīdevas, half gods,
<div n="lb"/>etc. are also dedicated and worshipped in temples.
