AHIṂSĀ¦. Non-injury. There are opinions both in favour
of and against Ahiṃsā in the purāṇas. Śukrācārya ex-
tols the importance of Ahiṃsā to the asuras (demons)
thus:
<Poem>Bho! Devaripavaḥ satyaṃ
Bravīmi bhavatāṃ hitam
Ahiṃsā paramo dharmo
Hantavyā hyātatāyinaḥ
Dvijairbhogaratairvede
Darśitaṃ hiṃsanam paśoḥ
Jihvāsvādaparaiḥ Kāma—
Mahiṃsaiva parā matā.</Poem>

good for you. Non-injury to any living being is the most
righteous thing. Do not molest even those who come to
kill you. Even that act would be ‘hiṃsā’ (injury). It
was those brahmins who were attached to worldly plea-
sures and addicted to overeating that enjoined in the
Vedas that hiṃsā is permissible for yāgas.” (Devī Bhāga-
vata, Skanda 4). Mārkaṇḍeya Muni (sage) says thus:
“Why should I mind the innumerable killings going on
unnoticed in this world full of life. People of old speak
very sacredly about Ahiṃsā. But O best of brahmins,
who can live in this world without injury to another
life?” (M.B., Araṇya Parva, Ślokas 32 & 33, Chapter
208).
