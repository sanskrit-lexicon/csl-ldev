TIRAYĀṬṬAM¦. A form of unrefined drama current in
<div n="lb"/>Kerala. This ancient art originally came into being to
<div n="lb"/>propitiate some gods. There are others of this kind like
<div n="lb"/>‘Mutiyeṭṭu’ ‘Tīyāṭṭu’ and ‘Ayyappan Pāṭṭu’ which all
<div n="lb"/>belong to a class of Ritualistic plays.
<div n="NI"/>This folk drama is a colourful pageant devoted to
<div n="lb"/>gods. Its artistic value is worth noticing. This is known
<div n="lb"/>by different names like ‘Tira’, ‘Teyya’ and ‘Kaliyāṭṭam’.
<div n="lb"/>‘Tira’ in ancient language means ‘daivadarśana’ (sight
<div n="lb"/>of gods) ‘Teyya’ is the corrupt form of ‘daiva’. Tirayā-
<div n="lb"/>ṭṭam is a visible amusement where actors appear dressed
<div n="lb"/>as gods. Because the actors dance in the dresses of gods,
<div n="lb"/>this is called devāṭṭam also. Teyyāṭṭam is the distorted
<div n="lb"/>form of devāṭṭam. Because this is both a Kali (play) and
<div n="lb"/>an āṭṭam (dance) this is called Kaliyāṭṭam also.
<div n="NI"/>This is held in different parts of Malabar during the
<div n="lb"/>period of January to April. It is a programme of three
<div n="lb"/>days. The first programme is to exhibit an Ālākolam.
<div n="lb"/>This is done on the night of the first day. The second
<div n="lb"/>programme is to exhibit the vellāṭṭukolam which will be
<div n="lb"/>done on the second day evening. An indication of this
<div n="lb"/>is given on the first night itself. The programme of the
<div n="lb"/>second day begins with a dance called Velakkali. On
<div n="lb"/>that day there will be worshipping of gods at intervals.
<div n="lb"/>The Vellāṭṭukolam begins by five in the evening. The
<div n="lb"/>chief actor will present himself before the public in the
<div n="lb"/>colourful robes of a god and will begin to dance to the
<div n="lb"/>accompaniment of drums and music. As the dance and
<div n="lb"/>music continues even those without dresses would start
<div n="lb"/>dancing. Gradually sounds of pop-guns and instru-
<div n="lb"/>mental music will rend the air. The chief dancer after
<div n="lb"/>dancing for some-time would place a stool before the
<div n="lb"/>temple and spread a white cloth on it. Then the dancer
<div n="lb"/>would sit in meditation and do the ceremony called
<div n="lb"/>‘calling the gods’. He would then pray to the gods to
<div n="lb"/>bless the function and appear at the zodiacal sign of
<div n="lb"/>Virgin. The dance and music start again. Then the
<div n="lb"/>people assembled would throw rice and flower into the
<div n="lb"/>cloth on the stool. The dancer-god holds a weapon in
<div n="lb"/>his hand and changes it often making huge uproars.
<div n="lb"/>Then after finishing the ceremonies like Kāvūṭṭu and
<div n="lb"/>Arulappāṭu, the Vellāṭṭakkāran retires. Then another
<div n="lb"/>actor in the dress of another god appears as Vellāṭṭak-
[Page790-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>kāran and repeats the programme of his predecessor.
<div n="lb"/>Because the dance (āṭṭam) is done before a white (vella)
<div n="lb"/>cloth the dance is called Vellāṭṭam.
<div n="NI"/>After the vellāṭṭam before midnight Tirayāṭṭam begins.
<div n="lb"/>The dresses of the teyyas differ slightly from each other.
<div n="lb"/>Some Tiras wear jackets and skirts while some wear
<div n="lb"/>flower garlands made of Tulasī leaves (basil plant) and
<div n="lb"/>ceṭṭi (jungle geranium). All the tiras rush to the temple
<div n="lb"/>in great spirit and they are followed by lamp-holders
<div n="lb"/>and torch-bearers to the accompaniment of loud sounds
<div n="lb"/>of musical instruments and uproars from the spectators.
<div n="lb"/>When the first round of dances is over, the ‘Teyya’
<div n="lb"/>stands dancing, pouring blessings to the people and
<div n="lb"/>deciding ways of atonement for the sins done. Then
<div n="lb"/>food is offered to the gods and the function ends with
<div n="lb"/>a ‘Vela’ circling the temple.
