SAṄKOCA¦. One of the Rākṣasas, who, in ancient days
<div n="lb"/>ruled the earth and ultimately died. The story of
<div n="lb"/>Saṅkoca was told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira to prove
<div n="lb"/>the truth that even the greatest and most powerful has,
<div n="lb"/>one day or other, to quit life and die. Among such
<div n="lb"/>great ones are included Pṛthu, Aila, Maya, Bhauma,
<div n="lb"/>Naraka, Śambara, Hayagrīva, Pulomā, Svarbhānu,
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda, Namuci, Dakṣa, Vipracitti, Virocana,
<div n="lb"/>Suhotra, Vṛṣa, Vṛṣabha, Kapilāśva, Virūpa, Bāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Kārtasvara, and Viśvadaṃṣṭra. Though all of them
[Page688-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>were once emperors they had to give room to the next
<div n="lb"/>generation. Bhīṣma, on his bed of arrows, was thus
<div n="lb"/>describing the transience of life. (Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>277).
