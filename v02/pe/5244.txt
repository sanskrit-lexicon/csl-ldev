PRABHĀVATĪ V¦. Daughter of the demon Vajranābha.
<div n="lb"/>She was married to Pradyumna, son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a very valiant demon called Vajranābha.
<div n="lb"/>He went into the valley of Meru and performed penance
<div n="lb"/>to propitiate Brahmā. Brahmā appeared before him
<div n="lb"/>and he got from him boons such as strength to conquer
<div n="lb"/>and subdue all kings, the secret of leaving the body
<div n="lb"/>and entering that of others etc. Empowered with these
<div n="lb"/>boons he made Vajranābhapura his capital. He got a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Prabhāvatī. His brother Sunābha had
<div n="lb"/>two daughters named Candramatī and Guṇavatī.
<div n="NI"/>While he was thus living there, he set out on a campaign
<div n="lb"/>of victory. He conquered the whole world and then
<div n="lb"/>turned his eyes towards Svarga. Going to Indraloka he
<div n="lb"/>told thus: “Hi, son of Kaśyapa, I am also born of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa. Your mother Aditi and my mother Diti are
<div n="lb"/>both wives of Kaśyapaprajāpati. You ruled over Svarga
<div n="lb"/>till this time. Now, let me rule over it for some time.”
<div n="lb"/>Indra was embarrassed by this logical challenge and could
<div n="lb"/>not give any reply to him. Kaśyapaprajāpati was then
<div n="lb"/>performing a long Yāga and Indra replied he would find
<div n="lb"/>a solution to his demand when their father returned
<div n="lb"/>after the Yāga. From that moment onwards Indra
<div n="lb"/>started thinking of plans to destroy Vajranābha. He went
<div n="lb"/>and sought help from Śrī Kṛṣṇa residing in Dvārakā.
<div n="lb"/>Krsna promised to help him when the time came.

<div n="lb"/>After returning to Devaloka, Indra started planning to
<div n="lb"/>kill Vajranābha. Vajranābhapurī was surrounded by sky-
<div n="lb"/>scraping fortresses and admission inside was restricted.
<div n="lb"/>He, therefore, called the gaily loitering swans of Deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka to his side and told them thus: “Look here, swan—
<div n="lb"/>ladies. You should go to Vajranābhapurī and see
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāvatī and then describe to her the beauty and
<div n="lb"/>goodness of Pradyumna. Your description should be
<div n="lb"/>such that Prabhāvatī should fall in love with Pradyumna.
<div n="lb"/>After that you should go to Pradyumna and tell him
<div n="lb"/>about Prabhāvatī in a similar way. On completing your
<div n="lb"/>mission you should come and report to me.”
<div n="NI"/>Obeying the orders of Indra the swans flew to Vajra-
<div n="lb"/>nābhapurī. They saw Prabhāvatī in a secluded spot and
<div n="lb"/>told her just what they were asked to tell her. Then they
<div n="lb"/>flew to the side of Pradyumna and told him about
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāvatī. After successfully completing their mission
<div n="lb"/>they flew to Devaloka. The marriage day of Prabhā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī drew near. The swans went to Prabhāvatī again
<div n="lb"/>and made her request her father to include the per-
<div n="lb"/>formances of a dramatic troupe also in the programme
<div n="lb"/>of marriage festivities. Vajranābha agreed and a troupe
<div n="lb"/>was invited. The dramatic troupe comprised among
<div n="lb"/>others many Yādava soldiers, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Pradyumna
<div n="lb"/>and his brothers, all in disguise. Their drama was Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa. The performance was superb and even Vajranābha
<div n="lb"/>stood amazed at their skill. The troupe was encamped in
<div n="lb"/>another palace and treated as royal guests. The compa-
<div n="lb"/>nion maid of Prabhāvatī, Sūcīmukhī, united her with
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna during the dark hours of the night and they
<div n="lb"/>spent the nights in amorous sports. The daughters of
<div n="lb"/>Vajranābha's brother, Candravatī and Guṇavatī came
<div n="lb"/>to know of these secret meetings and they requested
<div n="lb"/>Prabhāvatī to find out suitable persons among the Yā-
<div n="lb"/>davas for them also to enjoy with. Prabhāvatī intro-
<div n="lb"/>duced them to Gada and Sāmba both sons of Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The amorous sports of all of them continued freely
<div n="lb"/>during the nights.
<div n="NI"/>When things progressed so far, Indra and Kṛṣṇa persuaded
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna to kill Vajranābha. Pradyumna started a
<div n="lb"/>war with Vajranābha and in the great battle that en-
<div n="lb"/>sued Pradyumna killed Vajranābha. Pradyumna and
<div n="lb"/>his brothers then took the demon girls to Dvārakā.
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna, Gada and Sāmba married Prabhāvatī,
<div n="lb"/>Candravatī and Guṇavatī respectively. By this time
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapaprajāpati returned to Devaloka after his long
<div n="lb"/>yāga. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Chapters 91 to 95).
