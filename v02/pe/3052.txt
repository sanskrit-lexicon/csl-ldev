KAIKASĪ¦. Mother of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} From the wrath of Brahmā the giant
<div n="lb"/>Praheti was born and from Brahmā's hunger the demi-
<div n="lb"/>god Heti was born. The son Vidyutkeśa was born to
<div n="lb"/>Heti, of Bhayā the sister of Kāla (God of death—Time).
<div n="lb"/>Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā. A son named Sukeśa was born to them.
<div n="lb"/>Sukeśa married Devavatī daughter of Maṇimaya, a
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva. Three sons Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī
<div n="lb"/>were born to them. The three brothers Mālyavān,
<div n="lb"/>Sumālī and Mālī married Sundarī, Ketumatī and
<div n="lb"/>Vasudhā respectively, the three daughters of Narmadā,
<div n="lb"/>a gandharva woman. To Sumālī, by his wife Ketumatī,
<div n="lb"/>were born the ten sons, Prahasta, Akampana, Vikaṭa,
<div n="lb"/>Kālakāmukha, Dhūmrākṣa, Daṇḍa, Supārśva, Saṃ-
<div n="lb"/>hrāda, Prākvāta and Bhāsakarṇa and four daughters
<div n="lb"/>Vekā (Bṛhā), Puṣpotkaṭā, Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} As Sumālī was walking through forests
<div n="lb"/>with his wives and daughters, he saw so many Yakṣas
<div n="lb"/>(demi-gods) going in planes to pay homage to
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśravaṇa. Sumālī understood that Vaiśravaṇa
<div n="lb"/>became worthy of homage because he was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Viśravas. So he took his daughter Kaikasī and left
<div n="lb"/>her in the house of Viśravas. After a while, being
[Page364-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>pleased with her services, Viśravas took her as his
<div n="lb"/>wife. Once she requested her husband for children.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly she got Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīṣaṇa as sons.
