GUṆAŚARMAN¦. A character of the Purāṇas well versed
in all arts and sciences. He was the son of the brahmin
Ādityaśarman of Ujjayinī. The birth of Guṇaśarman
bears a story. Once Ādityaśarman went to the forests and
by his spiritual powers made Sulocanā, a celestial
nymph, to merge with him. A son was born to them
and he was named Guṇaśarman. Ādityaśarman
became a deva. Even from boyhood he became very
erudite. Once Indra came to see Ādityaśarman. Āditya-
śarman who was in deep thoughts did not see Indra
and so did not rise up when Indra came. Indra felt
insulted and cursed him to be born again on Earth.
Ādityaśarman prostrated before Indra and asked for
pardon. Indra then said that it would be enough if
his son was born on Earth in his stead. So Guṇaśarman
was born on Earth to bear the curse of his father.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Ujjayinī was being ruled over by a King
called Mahāsena. He had a very beautiful wife named
Aśokavatī. Guṇaśarman became gradually an intimate
friend of the King. Knowing that Guṇaśarman was
well versed in all arts the King and queen asked him
to give them a performance in dancing. The dance
was so excellent that the King engaged Guṇaśarman to
teach dancing to Aśokavatī.
<div n="NI"/>Once a royal attendant tried to give poisoned food to
the King and Guṇaśarman finding it out saved the
King. From that day onwards the King loved him
more. When once Mahāsena was imprisoned by his
enemies Guṇaśarman by his magic powers released
him. In return for this help the King gave Guṇaśar-
man a thousand villages.
<div n="NI"/>Then to the misfortune of all Aśokavatī fell in love
with Guṇaśarman. Guṇaśarman bluntly refused her
love. Embittered at this Aśokavatī started talking ill of
Guṇaśarman and the King at last sent Guṇaśarman out
from the palace. The servants of the King tried to
capture him and put him into prison but Guṇaśarman
escaped from the royal servants by his magic powers.
<div n="NI"/>He then went and stayed in the house of a brahmin
named Agnidattā and married his daughter, Sundari.
Then on the advice of the brahmin Guṇaśraman did
penance to propitiate Subrahmaṇya and got many
more powers from him. Gunaśarman equipped with
these additional powers conquered Mahāsena and his
country and became King there. He then sent Mahāsena
and his wife Aśokavatī, out from the country. (Sūrya-
prabhālaṃbaka, Taraṅga 6, Kathāsaritsāgara).
