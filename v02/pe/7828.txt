UTTAṄKA¦ (UTAṄKA). An ideal disciple of Veda
<div n="lb"/>who was the disciple of Āpodadhaumya.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Uttaṅka and the Guru's wife.%} After entrusting manage-
<div n="lb"/>ment of the āśrama to Uttaṅka, Veda once went out
<div n="lb"/>on a tour of the country, and Uttaṅka stayed in the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama carrying out the instructions of the Guru. Then
<div n="lb"/>came the menstrual period of Veda's wife, and his other
<div n="lb"/>wives requested Uttaṅka to do the needful, so that the
<div n="lb"/>fertile period of their co-wife was not wasted. Uttaṅka's
<div n="lb"/>reply to them was as follows:- “Asked by women, I
<div n="lb"/>shall not do this improper act; and the preceptor has
<div n="lb"/>not asked me to do such a thing though it might be
<div n="lb"/>improper.”
<div n="NI"/>His Guru, Āpodadhaumya returned to the Āśrama some
<div n="lb"/>time after this, and was very pleased to hear about the
<div n="lb"/>above incident. He blessed Uttaṅka. (M.B. Ādī Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%His tuition fee.%} His education being over, it was now
<div n="lb"/>time for Uttaṅka to give due offerings—tuition fee to his
<div n="lb"/>guru, and Uttaṅka enquired of the guru as to what he
<div n="lb"/>would have by way of dakṣiṇā. The guru asked
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka to get his wife's instruction in the matter and
<div n="lb"/>act accordingly. Because of the aforesaid incident
<div n="lb"/>(Uttaṅka not acting on the guru's wife during her
<div n="lb"/>menstrual period) she had a grouse against him, and
<div n="lb"/>therefore, asked him to bring as his tuition fee the ear-
<div n="lb"/>rings worn by the Kṣatriya wife of King Pauṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Uttaṅka set out to procure the ear-rings. On the
<div n="lb"/>way he saw an ox, and on its back a big man, who
<div n="lb"/>called out to Uttaṅka to eat the excretion of the ox.
<div n="lb"/>When Uttaṅka hesitated to do so, the man on the ox
<div n="lb"/>asked him again to eat it, pointing out that his guru,
<div n="lb"/>Veda, had done it. Then did Uttaṅka consume both
<div n="lb"/>the excretion and urine of the ox, and did his oblat-
<div n="lb"/>ions, in his perplexed mood, standing. Uttaṅka arrived
<div n="lb"/>at the palace of King Pauṣa and told him about the
<div n="lb"/>object of his visit. The King agreed to it. But, when
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka entered the Zenana Pauṣa's Kṣatriya wife
<div n="lb"/>could not be seen. When Uttaṅka told the King about
<div n="lb"/>this, he remained thoughtful for some time and told
<div n="lb"/>the former that he might surely have become impure
<div n="lb"/>due to performance of oblations in the wrong manner,
<div n="lb"/>and that his wife would not be visible, due to her
<div n="lb"/>chastity, to the eyes of such impure folk. Uttaṅka
<div n="lb"/>admitted to having, on his way, performed oblations
<div n="lb"/>not in the proper manner, and then he sat down
<div n="lb"/>facing the east after washing his hands, feet etc. and
<div n="lb"/>performed oblation in the correct manner. Then did the
<div n="lb"/>wife of King Pauṣa become visible to him, and she, pleas-
<div n="lb"/>ed at his humility, handed over her ear-rings to him.
<div n="lb"/>She also advised him to be very careful about the ear-
<div n="lb"/>rings as they had once been coveted by Takṣaka, King
<div n="lb"/>of the serpents. Bidding adieu to the queen, Uttaṅka
<div n="lb"/>saw the King and they sat together to take food. Not
<div n="lb"/>only was the rice cold; but a hair was also found in it.
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka cursed the King and rendered him blind,
<div n="lb"/>and the King, in turn, cursed Uttaṅka not to have
[Page815-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>children. But, both of them became calm quite soon
<div n="lb"/>and withdrew their curses.
<div n="NI"/>On his way back to the Āśrama with the ear-rings, he
<div n="lb"/>had only just stepped into a pool for a wash, when a
<div n="lb"/>naked Buddha sannyāsin, who was following him,
<div n="lb"/>snatched and ran off with the ear-rings. It was really
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka disguised as the sannyāsin who thus snatched
<div n="lb"/>the ear-rings. Uttaṅka chased him and caught him
<div n="lb"/>when he assumed his original form of the serpent King
<div n="lb"/>and disappeared into a cave. Uttaṅka waited at the
<div n="lb"/>mouth of the cave stupefied, when Indra deputed his
<div n="lb"/>Vajrāyudha to help Uttaṅka. The Vajrāyudha cut a
<div n="lb"/>tunnel-like route to Pātāla from the earth and through
<div n="lb"/>the cave Uttaṅka reached Pātāla by this route and
<div n="lb"/>found out the palace of Takṣaka.
<div n="NI"/>Though Uttaṅka praised and cajoled the Nāgas (ser-
<div n="lb"/>pents) their King Takṣaka did not make his appear-
<div n="lb"/>ance. Uttaṅka saw there two women, who had been
<div n="lb"/>weaving clothes, and on one machine there were black
<div n="lb"/>and white threads. The machine had one wheel with
<div n="lb"/>twelve spokes and was turned by six boys. Also was
<div n="lb"/>there a horse, and a man. When Uttaṅka praised them,
<div n="lb"/>the horse and the man approached him. The man
<div n="lb"/>advised Uttaṅka to blow through the anus of the horse
<div n="lb"/>so that the snakes could be brought round. Uttaṅka
<div n="lb"/>did so, when lo! from all the pores on the body of the
<div n="lb"/>horse, flames of fire began sprouting out. When the
<div n="lb"/>Nāgaloka (country of serpents) got thus filled with fire
<div n="lb"/>and flames, Takṣaka lost his nerves and came out with
<div n="lb"/>the stolen ear-rings, which Uttaṅka received back. But,
<div n="lb"/>that was the last day on which the rings had been
<div n="lb"/>promised to be given to his guru's wife by Uttaṅka,
<div n="lb"/>who remained there gloomy and sorrow-stricken at the
<div n="lb"/>thought that he would not be able to travel all the
<div n="lb"/>distance before sunset and give the ear-rings to the
<div n="lb"/>guru's wife. Then the horseman gave the horse to
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka, who reached the Āśrama just in time when
<div n="lb"/>the guru's wife was about to curse Uttaṅka for not
<div n="lb"/>returning with the rings though it was nearly dusk time.
<div n="lb"/>Now the guru and his wife blessed Uttaṅka, who de-
<div n="lb"/>tailed to them his experiences since leaving the Āśrama
<div n="lb"/>in quest of the ear-rings. Then the guru spoke thus to
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka—“The two women whom you found engaged
<div n="lb"/>in weaving were Dhātā and Vidhātā, the white and
<div n="lb"/>black strings, day and night, and the six boys who
<div n="lb"/>turned the wheel with twelve spokes were the six
<div n="lb"/>seasons. The ox seen by you on the way was Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>(Indra's elephant), the horse seen in Pātāla was Agni-
<div n="lb"/>deva, and the horseman, Indra. The excretion you ate
<div n="lb"/>on your way was nectar and that was the reason why
<div n="lb"/>you did not die in the Nāgaloka. Indra who is my
<div n="lb"/>friend blessed you because of mercy towards you, my
<div n="lb"/>disciple. You could bring back the ear-rings also be-
<div n="lb"/>cause of Indra's blessings.”
<div n="NI"/>Then the guru blessed Uttaṅka and the latter took
<div n="lb"/>leave of him. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Uttaṅka and Janamejaya's serpent yajña.%} Uttaṅka,
<div n="lb"/>determined on taking vengeance on Takṣaka, went
<div n="lb"/>away directly from the āśrama to Hastināpura, where
<div n="lb"/>he met Janamejaya and told him the fact that it was
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka, who had bitten to death Parīkṣit, his (Janame-
<div n="lb"/>jaya) father. It was thus prompted by Uttaṅka to take
<div n="lb"/>revenge upon Takṣaka that Janamejaya performed the
<div n="lb"/>serpent yajña. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 3).
[Page816-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Uttaṅka and Dhundhumāra.%} See under Dhundhumāra.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Uttaṅka attained salvation.%} Uttaṅka was put up at a
<div n="lb"/>place called Ujjālaka. When he became old, he went
<div n="lb"/>about visiting many temples. During this tour one day
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka saw a hunter in the forest called Gulika
<div n="lb"/>attempting to steal the golden plates on the dome of
<div n="lb"/>the Viṣṇu temple in Sauvīra. Gulika raised his sword to
<div n="lb"/>kill Uttaṅka, when he told the former that he would
<div n="lb"/>have to suffer the results of sin during many births
<div n="lb"/>if he committed a sin. This admonition of Uttaṅka so
<div n="lb"/>touched the heart of the hunter that he fell dead on the
<div n="lb"/>spot with a repentant heart. Uttaṅka sprinkled Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>water on the corpse of the hunter, who attained Vai-
<div n="lb"/>kuṇṭha (abode of Viṣṇu). On the advice of Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka went to Badarī where he did tapas and also
<div n="lb"/>attained Vaikuṇṭha. (Nāradīya Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>In Chapters 53-58 of Aśvamedha Parva of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata is related the story of one Uttaṅka muni, under
<div n="lb"/>the caption ‘Utaṅkopākhyāna.’ In Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>(original) he is referred to as Uttaṅka; but in its
<div n="lb"/>Malayālam rendering he is called Utaṅka. There are
<div n="lb"/>no substantial differences between the story of Uttaṅka
<div n="lb"/>and that of Utaṅka, Veda's disciple. But, since, there
<div n="lb"/>are differences, in certain aspects some information
<div n="lb"/>about the Uttaṅka of the ‘Utaṅkopākhyāna’ is given
<div n="lb"/>below—
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Uttaṅka was a disciple of Gautama, the
<div n="lb"/>husband of Ahalyā. The guru had more love for
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka than for his other disciples, and therefore did
<div n="lb"/>not permit the latter to leave the Āśrama even after
<div n="lb"/>the other disciples were sent away. Uttaṅka became
<div n="lb"/>old; wrinkles attacked his body and greyness his head.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Tuition fee (Gurudakṣiṇā).%} Uttaṅka once returned
<div n="lb"/>from the woods with firewood, in a very tired condition.
<div n="lb"/>The daughter of the guru shed tears at the sight.
<div n="lb"/>Gautama called Uttaṅka to him and asked him about
<div n="lb"/>the cause of his grief and sorrow. Uttaṅka replied that
<div n="lb"/>the hairs on his head turned grey on account of sorrow
<div n="lb"/>that he was not permitted to leave the Āśrama although
<div n="lb"/>it was hundred years since he had gone there first as
<div n="lb"/>disciple. Then Gautama permitted Uttaṅka to quit the
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama. Uttaṅka asked Gautama what he should
<div n="lb"/>offer as tuition fee. Gautama consulted his wife on the
<div n="lb"/>topic and she suggested as tuition fee the two ear-rings
<div n="lb"/>of gems worn by the wife of King Saudāsa, who used
<div n="lb"/>to eat the flesh of man. Immediately Uttaṅka set out
<div n="lb"/>to fetch the ear-rings and on his way met Saudāsa in
<div n="lb"/>the forest, and told the latter about his mission. Sau-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa tried to eat Uttaṅka, who told him that he was
<div n="lb"/>in duty bound to obtain the ear-rings for his guru's
<div n="lb"/>wife and that, after fulfilling the mission, he would
<div n="lb"/>return to Saudāsa to be eaten up by him. Saudāsa
<div n="lb"/>agreed to the proposition. He directed Uttaṅka to his
<div n="lb"/>wife Madayantī, who spoke to him thus—“Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣis covet these ear-rings. If I place them on the
<div n="lb"/>ground, serpents will steal them; if handed over to
<div n="lb"/>Ucchiṣṭa, Yakṣas will steal them, and if the watchman
<div n="lb"/>sleeps, Devas will snatch them off. Therefore, you
<div n="lb"/>should bring some token for me to believe that you are
<div n="lb"/>deputed by my husband.” Accordingly Uttaṅka went
<div n="lb"/>back to Saudāsa and returned to his wife with a token
<div n="lb"/>from him, and Madayantī handed over her ear-rings to
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka. Being told by Saudāsa that Uttaṅka need
<div n="lb"/>not return again to him, Uttaṅka started for Gautama's
<div n="lb"/>āśrama with the ear-rings. Feeling hungry on the way,
[Page816-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka tied to the branch of a vilva tree the ear-rings
<div n="lb"/>bundled in deer skin and ate vilva fruits. Just then the
<div n="lb"/>bundle of deer skin got untied and the ear-rings kept in
<div n="lb"/>it fell on the ground. A serpent carried off the rings
<div n="lb"/>between its teeth and concealed itself in a mole-hill.
<div n="lb"/>Highly grieved and upset by the sight, Uttaṅka fell
<div n="lb"/>down from the tree. For 35 days Uttaṅka dug the mole-
<div n="lb"/>hill. Then Indra felt great sympathy for him, appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed on the spot, and passed his Vajrāyudha through the
<div n="lb"/>mole-hill. Then the earth burst open and Uttaṅka
<div n="lb"/>entered Pātāla through the opening, and a horse, its
<div n="lb"/>tail white and the rest of the body black in colour
<div n="lb"/>presented itself to him. It asked Uttaṅka to blow
<div n="lb"/>through its anus. Uttaṅka did so and the Nāgaloka
<div n="lb"/>was filled with flames of fire. (The horse was Agnideva).
<div n="lb"/>Then did the serpents return the ear-rings to Uttaṅka,
<div n="lb"/>who returned with it to Gautama and presented it to
<div n="lb"/>him (Gautama) as tuition fee.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Uttaṅka about to curse Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Uttaṅka once went
<div n="lb"/>to Dvārakā, and during their talk was about to curse
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa for not attempting to bring about a compromise
<div n="lb"/>between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas. At once
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa exhibited his Viśvarūpa (himself as containing
<div n="lb"/>the whole universe). Thereupon Uttaṅka saluted Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>who asked him to request for any boon. He prayed for
<div n="lb"/>the boon that water might be made available in any
<div n="lb"/>desert he visited. Kṛṣṇa told him that whenever he
<div n="lb"/>required water he might successfully think of him.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Indra tested Uttaṅka.%} Some time afterwards, while
<div n="lb"/>roaming about quite thirsty and tired in a desert,
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka thought about Kṛṣṇa, and at once there ap-
<div n="lb"/>peared before him a naked Caṇḍāla, his body covered
<div n="lb"/>with mud. Dogs encircled him. Uttaṅka hesitated to
<div n="lb"/>drink the water given to him by this Caṇḍāla, who had
<div n="lb"/>some water with him. The Caṇḍāla again insisted on
<div n="lb"/>Uttaṅka drinking the water, but he again refused the
<div n="lb"/>offer. The caṇḍāla then disappeared with the dogs.
<div n="lb"/>Within a few minutes a person with disc, conch, club
<div n="lb"/>etc. about him appeared, and Uttaṅka recognised him
<div n="lb"/>as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Uttaṅka told Kṛṣṇa that it was not
<div n="lb"/>proper to give water to a brahmin through a caṇḍāla.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's reply to this was as follows:—“I asked Indra to
<div n="lb"/>give you nectar instead of water, and he argued that it
<div n="lb"/>was not proper that men should be given nectar. I
<div n="lb"/>pleaded for you again. Indra replied to this that he
<div n="lb"/>himself would, in the guise of a caṇḍāla give nectar to
<div n="lb"/>you, and he should not be found fault with, if you
<div n="lb"/>refused the nectar. I accepted that proposition of his.
<div n="lb"/>But, you did not accept nectar thus offered to you. So,
<div n="lb"/>you cannot be given nectar now. But, there will appear
<div n="lb"/>water-laden clouds in deserts which you traverse, which
<div n="lb"/>would be known as ‘Uttaṅka clouds’ and they would
<div n="lb"/>give you sweet water.
<div n="NI"/>Uttaṅka was pleased, and it is the Uttaṅka clouds,
<div n="lb"/>which form as per the above orders of Kṛṣṇa that cause
<div n="lb"/>rain to fall, though rarely, in deserts even today.
