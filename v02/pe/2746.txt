INDRA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Viṣṇu—Brahmā—Marīci—Kasyapa—
<div n="lb"/>Indra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapa was born to Marīci, the eldest of
<div n="lb"/>the spiritual sons of Brahmā. Indra was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa and Aditi, the eldest daughter of Dakṣa. The
<div n="lb"/>twelve sons who were born to Kaśyapa and Aditi are
<div n="lb"/>called Ādityas. The twelve Ādityas are—Dhātā, Aryamā,
<div n="lb"/>Mitra, Rudra, Varuṇa, Sūrya, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā,
<div n="lb"/>Savitā, Tvaṣṭā, and Viṣṇu. In addition to them, Aditi
<div n="lb"/>had twentyone sons more. Indra is the eldest of the 33
<div n="lb"/>sons. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Verses 9-15).
<div n="NI"/>Indra became the ruler of the Devas. Airāvata is
<div n="lb"/>Indra's elephant, Uccaiśśravas, his horse, and Vajra his
<div n="lb"/>weapon. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 51, M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indra and Garuḍa.%} Kaśyapa had two sons, Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Aruṇa by Vinatā and a large number of Nāgas by
<div n="lb"/>his other wife, Kadrū. Kadrū and her children kept
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā and her son Garuḍa as their servants. Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>agreed to set them free if they brought Amṛta from
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kadrū and her children asked Garuḍa to carry
<div n="lb"/>them to the beautiful Nāgālaya in the middle of the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. Garuḍa carried them on his shoulders and flew
<div n="lb"/>very high near the sky. The excessive heat of the sun
<div n="lb"/>made the Nāgas unconscious. Kadrū, in her distress,
<div n="lb"/>prayed to Indra. Indra showered rain and cooled the
<div n="lb"/>atmosphere. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 25, Verses 7-
<div n="lb"/>17). They reached the lovely island in the middle of
<div n="lb"/>the ocean.
<div n="NI"/>Garuḍa decided to earn his freedom by bringing Amṛta
<div n="lb"/>from Devaloka. With determination, he flew up into
<div n="lb"/>heaven and secured Amṛta. The enraged Indra attack-
<div n="lb"/>ed him with his weapon, Vajra. But Garuḍa spread
<div n="lb"/>his feathers in such a way that he was not wounded.
<div n="lb"/>Indra was struck with wonder, and pleased with the
<div n="lb"/>beautiful feathers (Parṇa) of Garuḍa, named him
<div n="lb"/>‘Suparṇa’. At last Indra was pleased and allowed
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa to take Amṛta with him. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 32, Verses 18-25).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Indra came to have 1000 eyes.%} (See Tilottamā, 2nd
<div n="lb"/>Para).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Indra and Arjuna.%} (1) Kuntī, Pāṇḍu's wife had
<div n="lb"/>received five mantras from Durvāsas for begetting sons.
<div n="lb"/>One of those Mantras was chanted meditating on the
<div n="lb"/>sun even before she was married and Karṇa was born.
<div n="lb"/>After marriage she used three more of the Mantras and
<div n="lb"/>three sons were born to her from Yama, Vāyu and
<div n="lb"/>Indra respectively. The fifth Mantra was presented to
<div n="lb"/>Mādrī the other wife of Pāṇḍu. Thus Arjuna was the
<div n="lb"/>son of Kuntī by Indra. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>123).
<div n="NI"/>(2) There is a story of a rivalry between Indra and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna in the Mahābhārata. (See under ‘Khāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vadāha’).
[Page319-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(3) During their life in the forest, once Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>started to Kailāsa to worship Śiva. On the way Indra
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and showered his blessings on
<div n="lb"/>him. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 41, Verses 15, 16).
<div n="NI"/>(4) During his life in the forest, Indra presented to
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna who visited him in Indra's residence, a Gandh-
<div n="lb"/>arva named Citrasena as his companion. Citrasena
<div n="lb"/>taught him music, dance, etc. (M.B. Araṇya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 44, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(5) At the palace of Indra, as secretly instructed by
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Urvaśī approached Arjuna with advances of
<div n="lb"/>love. Arjuna who refused to yield to her temptations
<div n="lb"/>was turned into a eunuch by her curse. But Indra
<div n="lb"/>lifted the curse by saying that this curse would be an
<div n="lb"/>advantage to him during the incognito life of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. It was Citrasena who was used as a tool by
<div n="lb"/>Indra to test Arjuna's self control. (M.B. Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapters 44, 45).
<div n="NI"/>(6) In order to ensure Arjuna's victory in battle,
<div n="lb"/>Indra, disguised as a Brahmin, obtained by begging
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa's ear-rings. (M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 310).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Indra and Vṛtrāsura.%} A famous exploit of Indra was
<div n="lb"/>the killing of Vṛtrāsura. Under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtrāsura, the Kālakeyas and many other Rākṣasas
<div n="lb"/>besieged the Devas. The battle raged furiously. Indra
<div n="lb"/>fell down unconscious owing to the shower of arrows
<div n="lb"/>from Vṛtra. At once Vasiṣṭha with his divine power
<div n="lb"/>restored Indra to consciousness. Finding it impossible to
<div n="lb"/>kill Vṛtra, the nonplussed Devas under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Indra approached Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu told them that
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra could be killed only with the bone of the sage
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīca. So all of them approached Dadhīca. Realising
<div n="lb"/>the situation, Dadhīca let Indra have his bone for the
<div n="lb"/>purpose. Indra made his weapon Vajra with that bone
<div n="lb"/>and receiving a fatal stroke from it, Vṛtra fell down
<div n="lb"/>dead. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 101, Verses 14, 15;
<div n="lb"/>Śānti Parva, Chapter 281, Verses 13-21).
<div n="NI"/>By killing Vṛtra Indra incurred the sin of Brahmahatyā.
<div n="lb"/>To expiate for that sin the Devas and Ṛṣis took Indra
<div n="lb"/>to Sarayū river and performed his holy bath there.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 24th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>(For further details about Vṛtrāsura see under Vṛtrā-
<div n="lb"/>sura).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Indra and Cyavana.%} Indra did not allow the Aśvinī-
<div n="lb"/>devas to drink soma juice. The sad Aśvinīdevas left
<div n="lb"/>Indraloka and while passing through a forest, they met
<div n="lb"/>Sukanyā, wife of the sage Cyavana. She was extremely
<div n="lb"/>beautiful. The Aśvinīdevas advised her to become their
<div n="lb"/>wife instead of being the wife of the blind Cyavana.
<div n="lb"/>But Sukanyā rejected their advice. Pleased by her
<div n="lb"/>conjugal fidelity, they restored Cyavana's eyesight and
<div n="lb"/>made him a youth with beautiful eyes. In his gratitude,
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana promised to get permission for them to drink
<div n="lb"/>soma juice. He performed a yāga. Indra, Aśvinī devas
<div n="lb"/>and other gods attended it. Indra insisted that the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīs should not be allowed to drink Soma juice.
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana disputed with him and in the dispute Indra
<div n="lb"/>was defeated. From that time the Aśvinīs were allowed
<div n="lb"/>Soma drinking. See also ‘Cyavana’. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 124, Verse 14; Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 156, Verses 16-31).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Indra and Triśiras.%} Indra's brother Tvaṣṭṛ did not
<div n="lb"/>like some of Indra's activities. With the object of
<div n="lb"/>rebuking Indra, Tvaṣṭṛ begot a son named Viśvarūpa,
<div n="lb"/>Viśvarūpa had three faces and so he was also called
[Page319-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Triśiras. With one face he used to recite Vedas, with
<div n="lb"/>the second he drank alcohol and he used the third face
<div n="lb"/>for observing the world. He performed a rigorous
<div n="lb"/>tapas. Indra, who was alarmed at it, sent goddesses to
<div n="lb"/>allure him, but in vain. At last Indra himself went to
<div n="lb"/>the forest riding on his elephant Airāvata and killed
<div n="lb"/>Triśiras with his Vajrāyudha. In his violent fury he
<div n="lb"/>had the three heads of Triśiras cut by a carpenter.
<div n="lb"/>From that day, it was ordained that the head of the
<div n="lb"/>cow sacrificed at yāgas should be given to a carpenter.
<div n="lb"/>Tvaṣṭṛ who was enraged by Indra's killing of his son
<div n="lb"/>Triśiras, begot another son Vṛtrāsura. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>6th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Indra and Nahuṣa.%} See the word Agastya.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Indra and Bali.%} When Indra defeated and drove
<div n="lb"/>away the Asuras, Mahābali, the Asura emperor assu-
<div n="lb"/>med the form of an ass and hid himself in an empty
<div n="lb"/>house. Brahmā informed Indra of this. Indra found
<div n="lb"/>him out there, but set him free without killing at the
<div n="lb"/>behest of Brahmā. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 223).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Indra and Yayāti.%} Yayāti was the son of Nahuṣa. In
<div n="lb"/>his old age, he handed over the kingly duties to his
<div n="lb"/>younger son Pūru and went to the forest for performing
<div n="lb"/>penance. After performing penance, he reached
<div n="lb"/>Indraloka in the end. Indra did not like Yayāti's boast
<div n="lb"/>that there was none who had greater power of tapas
<div n="lb"/>than himself. Indra pushed him down to the world.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 88).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Indra and Śaradvān.%} Śaradvān was born as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Sage Gautama. Śaradvān started a penance for acquir-
<div n="lb"/>ing divine arrows. Devendra who was alarmed, sent the
<div n="lb"/>Apsarā woman Jānapatī to obstruct his tapas. Deeply
<div n="lb"/>affected by her irresistible charm and fascinated by
<div n="lb"/>her temptations, he had an involuntary emission of
<div n="lb"/>semen, which fell on the Śarastamba and split itself into
<div n="lb"/>two parts. Two children a boy and a girl, were born
<div n="lb"/>from it. The King's servants brought them to
<div n="lb"/>Hastināpura. The boy was named Kṛpa and the girl
<div n="lb"/>was named Kṛpī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 130).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Indra and King Kuru.%} The King named Kuru was
<div n="lb"/>once ploughing the field at the place known as Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra. (This was long before Kurukṣetra became
<div n="lb"/>famous as the battlefield of Bhārata Yuddha). Indra
<div n="lb"/>who happened to come that way at the time, seeing the
<div n="lb"/>King tilling the land, asked him why he was doing so.
<div n="lb"/>The King replied that he was performing a yāga to
<div n="lb"/>enable the men who fell dead there, to attain Heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Indra returned to Heaven, smiling. Other devas came
<div n="lb"/>to know of this from Indra. They said that if all men
<div n="lb"/>came to Devaloka, the share of yajña which was to be
<div n="lb"/>received by the gods, would be diminished and so they
<div n="lb"/>advised Indra to go and give some boon to King Kuru.
<div n="lb"/>Indra returned to earth and gave his blessing to Kuru
<div n="lb"/>as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The following classes of people will attain heaven if
<div n="lb"/>they die there (at Kurukṣetra).
<div n="NI"/>(1) Those who die of starvation.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Those who die fighting heroically.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Those who were men in their previous life, but
<div n="lb"/>who have been born as animals.
<div n="NI"/>From that time Kurukṣetra became an important
<div n="lb"/>place. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 53).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Indra and Takṣaka.%} Indra's friend, a Nāga named
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka lived in Khāṇḍava forest. When Agni burned
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍava forest, Indra caused the rain to fall in order
[Page320-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>to save Takṣaka. See under ‘Khāṇḍavadāha’. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Parva, Chapter 235).
<div n="NI"/>For the story of how Indra saved Takṣaka from the
<div n="lb"/>Sarpasatra see under ‘Āstika’.
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Indra and Khāṇḍavadāha.%} At the time of
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍavadāha, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna fought against
<div n="lb"/>Devendra.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Indra Sabhā.%} Maya undertook to build a sabhā
<div n="lb"/>(assembly hall) for the Pāṇḍavas at Indraprastha.
<div n="lb"/>When it was being discussed, the sage Nārada described
<div n="lb"/>to them Indra's sabhā as given below:—
<div n="NI"/>Indra has a Sabhā which dazzles with divine effulgence.
<div n="lb"/>It is 150 yojanas in length and 100 yojanas in breadth.
<div n="lb"/>It has a height of five yojanas. Beautiful storeyed
<div n="lb"/>buildings and divine trees add to the grandeur of the
<div n="lb"/>sabhā. Indra is seated within the holy light in it.
<div n="lb"/>Śacīdevī takes her seat near him. Indra is very hand-
<div n="lb"/>some. He wears a crown, he is dressed in spotlessly
<div n="lb"/>pure clothes, and wears a garland round his neck.
<div n="lb"/>Maruts, Siddhas, Devas, Ṛṣis and a host of others
<div n="lb"/>stand around attending on him. They are all bright with
<div n="lb"/>the halo of fire. Parāśara, Parvata, Sāvarṇi, Gālava,
<div n="lb"/>Śaṃkha, Likhita, Gauraśiras, Durvāsas, Akrodhana,
<div n="lb"/>Śyena, Dīrghatamas, Pavitrapāṇi, Bhāluvi, Yājñavalkya,
<div n="lb"/>Uddālaka, Śvetaketu, Pāṇḍya and other famous sages
<div n="lb"/>are members of Indra's assembly. In this way, Indra's
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā is the most magnificent. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Indra and Kāmadhenu.%} Once Indra saw Surabhi, the
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenu, crying in the Indraloka. He asked her
<div n="lb"/>why she was crying. Surabhi answered: “My Lord, the
<div n="lb"/>cattle, who are my children are groaning in the world
<div n="lb"/>under the yoke of the farmer. I was overwhelmed with
<div n="lb"/>grief at the sight of their sufferings” Indra's heart meltt-
<div n="lb"/>ed due to Kāmadhenu's tears. He caused very heavy
<div n="lb"/>showers in the world when ploughing the fields became
<div n="lb"/>impossible. In this way as a result of Surabhi's tears
<div n="lb"/>Indra caused heavy rainfall which gave rest to the cattle
<div n="lb"/>in the world. (M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 9).
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Indra and Nala.%} Nala proceeded to Vidarbha to
<div n="lb"/>attend Damayantī's Svayaṃvara. On the way, the four
<div n="lb"/>gods, Indra, Agni, Varuṇa and Yama met him. (For
<div n="lb"/>further details see the word ‘Nala’). Nala married
<div n="lb"/>Damayanti with the blessings of these gods. When the
<div n="lb"/>devas returned, they met Kali and Dvāpara. to whom
<div n="lb"/>they described Nala's marriage. Kali and Dvāpara who
<div n="lb"/>wished to marry Damayantī, naturally felt disappointed
<div n="lb"/>and angry. Kali was about to pronounce a curse on
<div n="lb"/>Nala. But on the advice of Devendra he did not do so.
<div n="lb"/>Still he decided to gain secret entrance into Nala's
<div n="lb"/>body and to bring about the loss of his Kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Indra and Māndhātā.%} A King named Yuvanāśva
<div n="lb"/>was born in the Ikṣvāku dynasty. He earned great
<div n="lb"/>reputation by performing many Aśvamedha yāgas. But
<div n="lb"/>he was very much distressed because he had no child-
<div n="lb"/>ren. So he entrusted his kingly duties to his ministers
<div n="lb"/>and proceeded to the forest. One day during his wande-
<div n="lb"/>ring he arrived at the āśrama of the sage Bhṛgu. He
<div n="lb"/>was tired and thirsty. Bhṛgu had filled a pot with
<div n="lb"/>water by reciting a mantra and placing it on a low
<div n="lb"/>stool, he had gone to sleep. Not knowing that it was
<div n="lb"/>a pot of water intended to cause pregnancy, and in his
<div n="lb"/>intense thirst, Yuvanāśva drank water from it. He be-
<div n="lb"/>came pregnant and in due course Yuvanāśva brought
[Page320-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>forth a son. Indra, accompanied by other gods came
<div n="lb"/>to see the child. When the Devas asked how the child
<div n="lb"/>was going to drink milk, Indra put his index finger into
<div n="lb"/>the child's mouth and the child began to suck it. Indra
<div n="lb"/>said “The child will drink me”. The Sanskrit words
<div n="lb"/>“Māṃ dhātā” mean “one who drinks me”. Thus the
<div n="lb"/>child was named “Māndhātā” by Indra and the other
<div n="lb"/>gods. (M.B. Araṇya Parva Chapter 126).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%Indra and Śibi.%} Once Indra and Agni tested the
<div n="lb"/>strength of Emperor Śibi's ‘dharma’. Indra took the
<div n="lb"/>form of an eagle and Agni that of a dove. The dove flew
<div n="lb"/>down into the lap of Śibi. The eagle pursued it. The
<div n="lb"/>dove entreated Śibi to save it from the eagle. Śibi pro-
<div n="lb"/>mised to do so. The eagle argued that the dove was its
<div n="lb"/>prey and should be returned to it. But Śibi offered to
<div n="lb"/>give the eagle his own flesh, equal in weight to that of
<div n="lb"/>the dove. Accordingly, the dove was placed in one pan,
<div n="lb"/>but even when all the flesh from his body was cut and
<div n="lb"/>placed in the other pan, it did not weigh equal to the
<div n="lb"/>dove. At this stage, Indra and Agni appeared to Śibi
<div n="lb"/>in their own forms and blessed him to be more happy
<div n="lb"/>and prosperous than before. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 131).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%Indra and Yavakrīta.%} Long ago there was a sage
<div n="lb"/>named Yavakrīta. He started a tapas with the ambition
<div n="lb"/>of acquiring all knowledge by himself, without the help
<div n="lb"/>of a Guru. Indra was alarmed at the sternness and
<div n="lb"/>rigour of the tapas. He induced Yavakrīta to stop
<div n="lb"/>tapas, but it was in vain. At last Indra disguised him-
<div n="lb"/>self as an old Brahmin and went to the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā where Yavakrīta was performing tapas. He
<div n="lb"/>began to build a dam across the river with sand. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>this Yavakrīta ridiculed him. The old Brahmin retorted
<div n="lb"/>that Yavakrīta's tapas was also equally ridiculous. But
<div n="lb"/>Yavakrīta was not shaken even by his taunt. He resum-
<div n="lb"/>ed his tapas with renewed strength. At last finding
<div n="lb"/>no other alternative, Indra appeared to Yavakrīta and
<div n="lb"/>granted his wish. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 135).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Loss of Indra's umbrella.%} Once Narakāsura went
<div n="lb"/>to heaven, fought with the gods and robbed Indra of his
<div n="lb"/>umbrella and the earrings of Aditi, Indra's mother.
<div n="lb"/>Grief-stricken Indra complained to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Accom-
<div n="lb"/>panied by Satyabhāmā and riding on the back of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to the city of Prāgjyotiṣa, the
<div n="lb"/>residence of Narakāsura and razed it to the ground. He
<div n="lb"/>recovered the umbrella and ear-rings and returned to
<div n="lb"/>heaven with Satyabhāmā. Indra and Aditi were over-
<div n="lb"/>joyed on getting back the lost articles. On their return
<div n="lb"/>journey, Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the request of Satyabhāmā cut
<div n="lb"/>for her a twig of the Pārijāta tree. This made Indra
<div n="lb"/>angry and he fought against Śrī Kṛṣṇa. After defeating
<div n="lb"/>Indra and other gods, Śrī Kṛṣṇa accompanied by Sat-
<div n="lb"/>yabhāmā returned to Dvārakā with the Pārijāta. (Bhā-
<div n="lb"/>gavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Indra and Narakāsura.%} The Asura called Naraka
<div n="lb"/>once performed a very severe penance on the Gandha-
<div n="lb"/>mādana mountain with the object of usurping Indra's
<div n="lb"/>place. Indra was alarmed and rushed to Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>for help. Viṣṇu went to Gandhamādana mountain and
<div n="lb"/>killed Narakāsura. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 142).
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Indra and the sage Baka.%} After the war between
<div n="lb"/>Devas and Asuras, Indra, in a peaceful state of mind,
<div n="lb"/>was going around the world, riding on his elephant,
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata. When he reached an Āśrama on the eastern
<div n="lb"/>coast of the sea, he met the great sage Baka. A conver-
[Page321-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>sation about the happiness of longevity took place
<div n="lb"/>between Indra and sage Baka who was hundred thousand
<div n="lb"/>years old. After that Indra returned to Devaloka.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 193).
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Indra and Keśī.%} Long ago a terrible war took place
<div n="lb"/>between Devas and Asuras. At that time an Asura
<div n="lb"/>called Keśī attempted to abduct Devasenā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>a Prajāpati. Hearing her shrieks, Indra rushed to the
<div n="lb"/>spot. In the clash between Keśī and Indra, Keśī's club
<div n="lb"/>was broken into two with Indra's weapon Vajra.
<div n="lb"/>Suddenly Keśī lifted a mountain and threw it at Indra.
<div n="NI"/>Indra broke that mountain also into two. One part of
<div n="lb"/>it fell on Keśī himself, who fled frightened. After that,
<div n="lb"/>Indra asked Devasenā how she happened to fall in
<div n="lb"/>Keśī's hands. Devasenā answered thus:—“I am the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Prajāpati. My name is Devasenā. Keśī had
<div n="lb"/>abducted my elder sister, Daityasenā. My sister and
<div n="lb"/>I used to come to take our bath in this Mānasa lake.
<div n="lb"/>Keśī had expressed his wish to abduct both of us. My
<div n="lb"/>father has given me his blessing that a person who is
<div n="lb"/>worshipped by gods and asuras will become my husband.
<div n="lb"/>Having heard these facts, Indra held consultations with
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and arranged the marriage between Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya and Devasenā. See also the word “Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya”. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 223).
<div n="NI"/>26) {%Indra and Aṅgiras.%} After killing Vṛtrāsura, Indra
<div n="lb"/>hid himself in a lotus flower in the Mānasa lake, to
<div n="lb"/>expiate for the sin of Brahmahatyā (killing a Brahmin).
<div n="lb"/>It was at that time that Nahuṣa became Indra. After
<div n="lb"/>Nahuṣa had been forced to go back to the earth as a
<div n="lb"/>serpent by the curse of Agastya, the Devas brought
<div n="lb"/>back Indra. At that time, Aṅgiras praised Indra with
<div n="lb"/>mantras from Atharvaveda. From that day Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>got the name of ‘Atharvāṅgiras’. Indra was pleased
<div n="lb"/>and blessed Aṅgiras that his name would become
<div n="lb"/>famous throughout the world. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>27) {%Indra and the Bow called Vijaya.%} Karṇa had a
<div n="lb"/>bow called Vijaya. It was made by Viśvakarmā accor-
<div n="lb"/>ding to Indra's liking. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter 31.
<div n="lb"/>Verse 42).
<div n="NI"/>28) {%Indra and the Tripuras.%} The Tripurāsuras perform-
<div n="lb"/>ed penance and received boons from Brahmā. After
<div n="lb"/>that they clashed with Indra. Indra was not able to
<div n="lb"/>kill them. The vanquished Indra had the Tripuras
<div n="lb"/>killed by Śiva. See the word “Tripura”. (M.B. Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 33).
<div n="NI"/>29) {%Indra and Sūrya (the sun-god).%} When Karṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna came into conflict at the Bhārata battle, a con-
<div n="lb"/>troversy raged in heaven between Indra and Sūrya.
<div n="lb"/>Indra argued that Arjuna would win, while Sūrya as-
<div n="lb"/>serted that Karṇa would gain victory. The Devas joined
<div n="lb"/>the side of Arjuna and Asuras joined Karṇa's side. In
<div n="lb"/>the end, Arjuna came out victorious and thus Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>was defeated by Indra. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>87).
<div n="NI"/>30) {%Indra and Namuci.%} The Rākṣasa Namuci once
<div n="lb"/>evaded capture by Indra by remaining hidden in the
<div n="lb"/>rays of the Sun. Indra went to him and pretending
<div n="lb"/>friendship, promised not to kill him either with wet thing
<div n="lb"/>or dry things or at night or in day time. Trusting his
<div n="lb"/>words, Namuci came out. Then Indra cut off Namuci's
<div n="lb"/>head with the froth scraped from the waves of the sea
<div n="lb"/>at the time of dusk. The head pursued him shouting,
<div n="lb"/>“You murderer of a friend, by breaking your promise!”
[Page321-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Indra sought refuge under Brahmā. Brahmā advised
<div n="lb"/>him to bathe in Śoṇapuṇya tīrtha to expiate for the
<div n="lb"/>sin. Accordingly Indra bathed in the river Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>and washed off his sin.
<div n="NI"/>{%River Sarasvatī.%} There is a story about how Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>river became Śoṇapuṇya tīrtha. There were frequent
<div n="lb"/>quarrels between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra. Once
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra got angry when he came to know that
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha was performing a penance on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>river Sarasvatī. He summoned Sarasvatī and ordered
<div n="lb"/>her to produce Vasiṣṭha before him immediately.
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī was in a dilemma. If she brought Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>to Viśvāmitra, Vasiṣṭha would curse her; if on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, she did not bring him Viśvāmitra would curse her.
<div n="lb"/>At last she decided to produce Vasiṣṭha before Viśvāmi-
<div n="lb"/>tra. By eroding the earth on her bank little by little near
<div n="lb"/>the place where Vasiṣṭha was performing his penance,
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī managed to bring him down into her own
<div n="lb"/>current. Then she carried him floating down to the
<div n="lb"/>place where Viśvāmitra was waiting. When Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>reached his presence, Viśvāmitra was pleased. But
<div n="lb"/>without allowing Viśvāmitra to capture Vasiṣṭha she
<div n="lb"/>took him away in her current, eastwards. Enraged
<div n="lb"/>at this, Viśvāmitra pronounced a curse that blood
<div n="lb"/>should flow through the river Sarasvatī. Thus the
<div n="lb"/>water in the river became blood-red. The great sages
<div n="lb"/>who came there afterwards sympathised with Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>in her ill-luck and as a result of their prayers Śiva
<div n="lb"/>made her Śoṇapuṇyatīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>It was in this river that Indra took his bath and
<div n="lb"/>washed off his sin. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 43).
<div n="NI"/>31) {%Indra and Śrutāvatī.%} Bharadvāja's daughter
<div n="lb"/>Śrutāvatī (Śruvāvatī) performed a very severe penance
<div n="lb"/>to get Indra as her husband. To test her character,
<div n="lb"/>Indra assumed the shape of Vasiṣṭha and went to
<div n="lb"/>Śrutāvatī. She received the guest with due reverence.
<div n="lb"/>Pleased with her treatment, the guest handed her five
<div n="lb"/>raw fruits and asked her to cook them for him.
<div n="lb"/>Śrutāvatī gladly undertook that service. She proceeded
<div n="lb"/>to cook the fruits but even after burning all the fuel
<div n="lb"/>she had, the fruits were not properly cooked. So she
<div n="lb"/>began to use her limbs one by one as fuel and burned
<div n="lb"/>them up. Indra was deeply impressed by her self-
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice and appearing to her in his own form married
<div n="lb"/>Śrutāvatī, (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 48).
<div n="NI"/>32) {%Indra became Śatakratu.%} Indra performed one
<div n="lb"/>hundred sacrifices at the place called Indratīrtha. Thus
<div n="lb"/>he became Śatakratu. It was there that he gave much
<div n="lb"/>wealth to Bṛhaspati. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 49,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>33) {%Indra became a bird.%} Once Indra took the form of
<div n="lb"/>a bird and went to the forest and preached moral and
<div n="lb"/>spiritual duties to the sages who had gathered there.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>34) {%Indra and Dantideva.%} Once Dantideva received a
<div n="lb"/>boon from Indra that he should have plenty of food
<div n="lb"/>and enough travellers to eat it. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 29, Verses 120, 121).
<div n="NI"/>35) {%Indra and Bṛhaspati.%} Once Bṛhaspati told Indra
<div n="lb"/>that everything in the world could be achieved with
<div n="lb"/>soothing speech. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 84, Verse
<div n="lb"/>2).
<div n="NI"/>Bṛhaspati's wife Tārā once fell in love with Candra
<div n="lb"/>(the Moon god). She deserted Bṛhaspati and went to
<div n="lb"/>live in Candra's residence. Bṛhaspati complained
[Page322-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>about it to Indra. Indra promised to bring her back
<div n="lb"/>and to restore her to Bṛhaspati by whatever means
<div n="lb"/>possible. Accordingly he sent a messenger to Candra.
<div n="lb"/>Compromise talks with Candra ended in failure. So
<div n="lb"/>preparations were started for a dreadful war between
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Candra. Śukra, the preceptor of Asuras
<div n="lb"/>also joined the side of Indra. Brahmā who came to
<div n="lb"/>know of all this, came riding on his swan and recon-
<div n="lb"/>ciled Indra and Candra. As directed by Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>Candra agreed to restore Tārā to her lawful husband,
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati, (Devī Bhāgavata, First Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>36) {%Indra and Prahlāda.%} The great King Prahlāda once
<div n="lb"/>conquered Heaven. Indra, who lost his kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>glory, accepted Bṛhaspati's advice and went to meet
<div n="lb"/>Śukrācārya. Śukra told Indra that Prahlāda was the
<div n="lb"/>noblest person and that he had earned that nobility by
<div n="lb"/>his good qualities. Indra decided to acquire those good
<div n="lb"/>qualities from Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>Indra disguised himself as a Brahmin boy and approa-
<div n="lb"/>ched Prahlāda with a request for moral and spiritual
<div n="lb"/>advice. Prahlāda accepted him as his pupil and gave
<div n="lb"/>him moral and spiritual advice. Pleased with the
<div n="lb"/>pupil's devotion, Prahlāda agreed to give him whatever
<div n="lb"/>boon he wanted. The pupil said that he wanted only
<div n="lb"/>the good qualities of the Guru. Prahlāda agreed to it.
<div n="lb"/>Then a shadow-like figure appeared to emerge from
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda's body. Prahlāda who was puzzled asked the
<div n="lb"/>figure:—“Who are you” “The figure answered:—“I
<div n="lb"/>am your virtuous character. Now I am leaving you
<div n="lb"/>and entering this boy's body.” Saying thus it left
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda's body and entered Indra's body.
<div n="lb"/>Following it, all the good qualities of Prahlāda, like
<div n="lb"/>charity, truth, glory etc. entered Indra's body one
<div n="lb"/>after another. It was only in the end that Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>came to know that the cunning pupil was Indra. Thus
<div n="lb"/>from that day, Prahlāda began to decline in his good
<div n="lb"/>qualities and Indra began to prosper. (M.B. Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 124).
<div n="NI"/>37) {%Indra and Gautama.%} There is a story in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, of how Indra restored life to a dead Brahmin.
<div n="lb"/>Gautama was a Brahmin who had left his own home
<div n="lb"/>and settled down to live in the village of Dasyus (an
<div n="lb"/>aboriginal tribe). He married from a low caste and
<div n="lb"/>followed the customs of Dasyus. At that time another
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin happened to come there. He ridiculed
<div n="lb"/>Gautama who had lost his caste. Next morning
<div n="lb"/>Gautama left his residence and went to another place.
<div n="lb"/>Tired after his long journey, he fell asleep under a
<div n="lb"/>banyan tree. A King of birds named Nāḍījaṃgha
<div n="lb"/>lived on that tree. Nāḍījaṃgha who was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, became very friendly with Gautama. He
<div n="lb"/>brought fish from the river Gaṅgā to feed Gautama
<div n="lb"/>and fanned him with his wings. Gautama told the
<div n="lb"/>bird that he was a poor Brahmin and that he was
<div n="lb"/>anxious to get some wealth. There was a wealthy
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa King named Virūpākṣa in that country, who
<div n="lb"/>was a close friend of Nāḍījaṃgha. Nāḍījaṃgha sent
<div n="lb"/>Gautama to Virūpākṣa with a request to give Gautama
<div n="lb"/>some wealth. Virūpākṣa gave plenty of gold to
<div n="lb"/>Gautama. He returned to the foot of the banyan tree
<div n="lb"/>carrying the gold on his head. Gautama who was
<div n="lb"/>quite tired after his long walk, was hospitably received
<div n="lb"/>by Nāḍījaṃgha. That kingly bird lay asleep close by
<div n="lb"/>Gautama. An evil desire to eat the flesh of Nāḍī-
<div n="lb"/>jaṃgha dawned upon the mind of Gautama. He killed
[Page322-b+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>that King of birds in his sleep. Virūpākṣa who came to
<div n="lb"/>know of this, killed Gautama and gave his flesh as food
<div n="lb"/>for Dasyus. Virūpākṣa, with tears in his eyes, made a
<div n="lb"/>funeral pyre and cremated Nādījaṃgha's body. At that
<div n="lb"/>time, as directed by Brahmā, Surabhi caused milk to
<div n="lb"/>flow from heaven and revived Nāḍījaṃgha. Virūpākṣa
<div n="lb"/>told the whole story to Indra who came there at that
<div n="lb"/>time. Indra said that Nāḍījaṃgha died as the result of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's curse. He had offended Brahmā on a former
<div n="lb"/>occasion by refusing to attend Brahmā's assembly,
<div n="lb"/>although he was invited. Nāḍījaṃgha who was restored
<div n="lb"/>to life, was noble enough to request Indra to bring
<div n="lb"/>back Gautama also to life. Accordingly Indra revived
<div n="lb"/>Gautama. Nāḍījaṃgha returned the gold to Gautama
<div n="lb"/>and sent him away with his good wishes. Indra returned
<div n="lb"/>to heaven. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 173).
<div n="NI"/>38) {%Indra and Ahalyā.%} Indra, once fell in love with
<div n="lb"/>Ahalyā, the wife of Gautama. Sage Gautama who
<div n="lb"/>came to know of it, cursed Indra. For further details,
<div n="lb"/>see under Ahalyā.
<div n="NI"/>39) {%Indra turned into a Fox.%} Once a haughty Vaiśya
<div n="lb"/>knocked down a young sage named Kaśyapa, with his
<div n="lb"/>chariot. The disgraced sage decided to commit suicide.
<div n="lb"/>Knowing this Indra went to the sage in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>fox and spoke to him, dwelling upon the evil aspects
<div n="lb"/>of suicide. At last the young sage gave up the idea of
<div n="lb"/>committing suicide and returned to his hermitage.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 130).
<div n="NI"/>40) {%Indra and Subrahmaṇya.%} Long ago the Asuras led
<div n="lb"/>by Tārakāsura, persecuted the gods in many ways.
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāsura had received a boon from Brahmā that
<div n="lb"/>only the son born to Śiva could slay him. So, to dis-
<div n="lb"/>tract Parameśvara from his penance, in order to make
<div n="lb"/>it possible for him to beget a son, Indra sent Kāmadeva
<div n="lb"/>(god of love) to him. But Kāmadeva was burnt up in
<div n="lb"/>the fire from the third eye of Śiva. After that Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>won Śiva as her husband as a result of her austere
<div n="lb"/>penance. She prayed to Śiva that Kāmadeva should be
<div n="lb"/>brought back to life and that a son should be born to
<div n="lb"/>her. Śiva replied to her:—
<div n="NI"/>“Kāma was born from Brahmā's mind. As soon as he
<div n="lb"/>was born, he asked Brahmā “Kaṃ Darpam?” which
<div n="lb"/>means—whom shall I tempt and conquer?” So Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>called him “Kandarpa”. Brahmā had advised him
<div n="lb"/>even at that time that he should never tempt me.
<div n="lb"/>Disregarding that advice he came to attack me and I
<div n="lb"/>burned him up. Now it is not possible for him to be
<div n="lb"/>born in a physical form I shall beget of you a son
<div n="lb"/>with my spiritual power. I do not need the urge of
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva for this, as in the case of ordinary
<div n="lb"/>mortals”.
<div n="NI"/>As they were discussing this problem, Indra and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>arrived there. At their request Śiva agreed to beget a
<div n="lb"/>son by Pārvatī. Since it is not desirable that all
<div n="lb"/>living beings should perish, Śiva allowed Kāmadeva
<div n="lb"/>to be born in the minds of all creatures. Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>Indra returned quite happy. One day, Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī began their amorous dalliance. They did not
<div n="lb"/>stop it even after a hundred years. The whole world
<div n="lb"/>began to shake to its very foundations. Fearing that
<div n="lb"/>the world might perish, the devas, as ordered by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā prayed to Agni, to interrupt the amorous play
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva and Pārvatī. Agni, who understood that it was
<div n="lb"/>not possible to achieve their object, fled and concealed
<div n="lb"/>himself under water. The Devas went out in search
<div n="lb"/>of Agni. By that time, the creatures in the water who
[Page323-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>could not bear the heat of Agni, told them the secret.
<div n="lb"/>Then Agni deprived them of the power of speech by a
<div n="lb"/>curse. After that he went and hid himself on the
<div n="lb"/>Mandara mountain. Elephants and parrots disclosed
<div n="lb"/>the secrets of Agni, who was hiding within the hollow
<div n="lb"/>of the trunk of a tree. Agni deprived them of their
<div n="lb"/>tongues by a curse. At last the gods discovered Agni.
<div n="lb"/>They sent him at once to Śiva to stop him in his
<div n="lb"/>amorous dalliance. Agni succeeded in his mission by
<div n="lb"/>his intense heat. Śiva transferred his semen to Agni who
<div n="lb"/>became pregnant. Being unable to bear its weight Agni
<div n="lb"/>deposited it in the river Gaṅgā, who at the behest of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva himself, left it in the woods on the Mahāmeru
<div n="lb"/>mountain. Śiva's attendant bhūtas (spirits) offered
<div n="lb"/>Pūjā to it there. After a thousand years a boy with six
<div n="lb"/>faces (Subrahmaṇya) was born out of it. He was suck-
<div n="lb"/>led by the Kṛttikās employed for that purpose by
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī and the boy grew up with astonishing rapidity
<div n="lb"/>within a few days. Having been suckled by the
<div n="lb"/>Kṛttikās, the boy got the name “Kārttikeya”.
<div n="NI"/>In those days, Devendra who was defeated by Tārakā-
<div n="lb"/>sura, decided to give up war and was living in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru. The Devas and the sages used to go to Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya for protection. When Devendra knew it, he
<div n="lb"/>became angry and went to war with Subrahmaṇya.
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya was wounded on the face with Indra's
<div n="lb"/>weapon. From the wound two sons named Śākha and
<div n="lb"/>Viśākha were born to Subrahmaṇya. With their help
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya encountered Indra again. At this stage
<div n="lb"/>Śiva appeared there and informed Indra that Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya had been born with a mission to kill Tārakāsura
<div n="lb"/>and to restore Indra's kingdom to him. It was then
<div n="lb"/>that Indra recognized Subrahmaṇya. He begged pardon
<div n="lb"/>of Subrahmaṇya and expressed his desire to instal him
<div n="lb"/>as his military commander. When he tried to perform
<div n="lb"/>the ceremony of installation by sprinkling the holy
<div n="lb"/>water on Subrahmaṇya's head, the water refused to
<div n="lb"/>come out of the pot. Śiva told Indra that it was
<div n="lb"/>because he had tried to perform the installation before
<div n="lb"/>propitiating Gaṇapati. Indra then offered worship to
<div n="lb"/>Vighneśvara (Gaṇapati) and the ceremony went off
<div n="lb"/>without any hitch. Subrahmaṇya who thus became
<div n="lb"/>Indra's commander, killed Tārakāsura shortly after-
<div n="lb"/>wards. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃbaka, 6th
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>41) {%Indra and Mahābali.%} The vanquished Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>who had left his home and country was in gloom
<div n="lb"/>and despair when once Indra paid him a visit.
<div n="lb"/>At that time Mahālakṣmī emerged from Mahābali's
<div n="lb"/>body and entered Indra's body. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 224).
<div n="NI"/>42) {%Indra and Godāna (gift of cow).%} Once Indra asked
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā about the efficacy of godāna or giving a cow
<div n="lb"/>as gift. Brahmā told him that there is a world free from
<div n="lb"/>the infirmities of old age and diseases and it is called
<div n="lb"/>“Goloka”. He added that those who perform Godāna
<div n="lb"/>would get a place in Goloka.
<div n="NI"/>43) {%Indra and a bird.%} A hunter in Kāśī once went to
<div n="lb"/>shoot birds with poisoned arrows. One of his arrows
<div n="lb"/>hit a big tree accidentally and the powerful poison dried
<div n="lb"/>up the whole tree. In the hollow of the trunk of that
<div n="lb"/>tree there lived a bird with mystic powers. It did not
<div n="lb"/>like to leave that tree which had been its refuge
<div n="lb"/>ever since its birth. One day Devendra, in the guise of
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin came to the bird, who recognized him by
[Page323-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>its mystic power. In the conversation between them
<div n="lb"/>Devendra advised the bird to leave the tree and find
<div n="lb"/>some other suitable place for its residence. The bird
<div n="lb"/>did not accept his advice. Indra was pleased at the
<div n="lb"/>bird's loyalty and gratitude towards that tree which
<div n="lb"/>had been its shelter all along. So he took the bird
<div n="lb"/>along with him to Devaloka. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>44) {%How Indra turned Bhaṃgāśva into a woman.%} There
<div n="lb"/>was a King named Bhaṃgāśva. Once he performed a
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice called “Indradviṣṭa” which was believed to
<div n="lb"/>have the power of blessing him with children. Indra
<div n="lb"/>being not invited was displeased with him and was wait-
<div n="lb"/>ing for an opportunity to wreak vengeance on him.
<div n="NI"/>One hundred sons were born to Bhaṃgāśva. Once he
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest after entrusting the affairs of the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom to his sons. Indra cunningly misguided him
<div n="lb"/>and made him lose his way in the forest. Wandering
<div n="lb"/>alone with his horse in the forest, he reached the bank
<div n="lb"/>of a river. Weary and thirsty, he stepped down into the
<div n="lb"/>river. To his amazement, he was instantly transformed
<div n="lb"/>into a woman! The bewildered “woman” somehow
<div n="lb"/>reached Bhaṃgāśva's palace. All the members of his
<div n="lb"/>family were deeply grieved over his change of sex. To
<div n="lb"/>avoid embarrassment to himself and others, Bhaṃgāśva
<div n="lb"/>returned as a woman to the forest and there lived as
<div n="lb"/>the wife of a sage and became the mother of a hundred
<div n="lb"/>sons. After some years “she” went back to the palace
<div n="lb"/>with the sons and leaving them there returned again
<div n="lb"/>to the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Indra went to the palace at this time and made the
<div n="lb"/>two sets of hundred sons quarrel with one another
<div n="lb"/>until all of them perished in fighting. Hearing about
<div n="lb"/>this the mother who was in the forest, wept bitterly.
<div n="lb"/>Indra visited her (Bhaṃgāśva) there and she told him
<div n="lb"/>the whole story of her misfortunes and begged his
<div n="lb"/>pardon for performing Indradviṣṭa sacrifice without
<div n="lb"/>inviting Indra. Pleased with her repentance Indra
<div n="lb"/>promised to resuscitate one set of her hundred sons.
<div n="lb"/>She wanted all the hundred sons who were born when
<div n="lb"/>she was a woman, to be restored to life. Indra was
<div n="lb"/>ready to restore her manhood too, but she preferred
<div n="lb"/>to continue as a woman. Indra restored to life all the
<div n="lb"/>200 sons of Bhaṃgāśva and leaving Bhaṃgāśva as a
<div n="lb"/>woman, returned to Devaloka. (M.B. Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>45) {%Indra and Mataṃga.%} A story is found in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata under the title of “Indra-Mataṃga-Saṃvāda”
<div n="lb"/>which illustrates that a Kṣatriya, Vaiśya or Śūdra can
<div n="lb"/>never become a Brāhmaṇa by any means. It was told
<div n="lb"/>by Bhīṣma to Arjuna as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Long ago a Brāhmaṇa's wife gave birth to a boy. The
<div n="lb"/>boy was given the name Mataṃga. His father sent him
<div n="lb"/>in a chariot drawn by a donkey, in connection with a
<div n="lb"/>yāga which he wanted to perform. Mataṃga whipped
<div n="lb"/>the donkey mercilessly. Seeing this, the donkey's mother
<div n="lb"/>said to Mataṃga—“You are not a Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas cannot be so cruel. You are a Caṇḍāla (a
<div n="lb"/>man of the lowest caste) born to your mother by a
<div n="lb"/>barber.”
<div n="NI"/>Mataṃga sadly returned to his father and after telling
<div n="lb"/>him what he had heard from the mother-donkey set out
<div n="lb"/>to perform an austere penance with the object of
<div n="lb"/>becoming a Brāhmaṇa. Devendra appeared to him
<div n="lb"/>and asked him what he wanted. Mataṃga asked for a
[Page324-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>boon whereby he could become a Brāhmaṇa; Indra
<div n="lb"/>vanished after saying that it was impossible. After that
<div n="lb"/>Mataṃga performed penance for hundred years,
<div n="lb"/>standing on one foot. Indra appeared again and
<div n="lb"/>repeated that it was impossible for Mataṃga to be-
<div n="lb"/>come a Brāhmaṇa. Then Mataṃga continued his
<div n="lb"/>penance for a thousand years, standing on his toe.
<div n="lb"/>Indra appeared again and transformed Mataṃga into
<div n="lb"/>a Deva named “Chandodeva”. Indra told him that
<div n="lb"/>though he could become a Deva, he could never
<div n="lb"/>achieve Brahminhood. In his extreme grief Mataṃga
<div n="lb"/>renounced his life and entered Heaven. (M.B. Anuśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana Parva, Chapters 27, 28 and 29).
<div n="NI"/>46) {%Indra and Śaṃbara.%} There is a story in the Mahā
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata in which an Asura named Śaṃbara explained
<div n="lb"/>the greatness of Brahminhood to Indra. Once Indra
<div n="lb"/>approached the Asura, Śaṃbara and asked him what
<div n="lb"/>was the source of his glory and prosperity. Śaṃbara
<div n="lb"/>replied that it was all due to his whole-hearted worship
<div n="lb"/>of Brāhmaṇas. From that time Indra began to offer
<div n="lb"/>worship to Brāhmaṇas and thus he won the place of
<div n="lb"/>Indra. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 36).
<div n="NI"/>47) {%Indra loved Ruci.%} There is a story in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata of how a sage named Vipula who was born in
<div n="lb"/>the family of Bhṛgu once saved Ruci, his Guru's wife
<div n="lb"/>from Indra. Long ago, a great sage named Devaśarmā
<div n="lb"/>lived in a forest. His wife Ruci being enchantingly
<div n="lb"/>beautiful, many suitors were attracted to her. Chief
<div n="lb"/>among them was Indra. Devaśarmā was aware of this.
<div n="lb"/>Once he had to leave his āśrama in connection with a
<div n="lb"/>yāga. So he ordered his disciple Vipula to guard his
<div n="lb"/>wife Ruci during his absence. He had given a hint to
<div n="lb"/>Vipula that Indra who was an expert in disguises,
<div n="lb"/>might appear in the āśrama in any form. Vipula, by
<div n="lb"/>means of his mystic power entered into his guru's wife
<div n="lb"/>and guarded her.
<div n="NI"/>After some time, Indra reached the Āśrama in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of a handsome youth. He disclosed his real identity to
<div n="lb"/>Ruci and told her that he had come there to spend a
<div n="lb"/>night with her. Ruci fell in love with him. But since
<div n="lb"/>she was under the mystic control of Vipula, Indra was
<div n="lb"/>unable to fulfil his desire. At last Vipula sent him away
<div n="lb"/>in disgrace. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 4, 44).
<div n="NI"/>48) {%Indra's theft of Lotus.%} Indra once stole Agastya's
<div n="lb"/>lotuses. (See under Agastya).
<div n="NI"/>49) {%Indra's theft of an Elephant.%} Indra once stole an
<div n="lb"/>elephant belonging to the great sage Gautama. The
<div n="lb"/>sage complained to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who advised him to
<div n="lb"/>offer prayers to Indra. Accordingly Gautama pleased
<div n="lb"/>Indra by his prayers. Indra appeared and after return-
<div n="lb"/>ing the elephant took both the elephant and Gautama
<div n="lb"/>along with him to Devaloka. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 102).
<div n="NI"/>50) {%Indra and Marutta.%} Long ago there was a famous
<div n="lb"/>king named Marutta. Indra was closely associated with
<div n="lb"/>him in many of his activities. (For more details see
<div n="lb"/>Marutta).
<div n="NI"/>51) {%Indra and Dharmaputra.%} Another anecdote about
<div n="lb"/>Indra which deals with the last part of Dharmaputra's
<div n="lb"/>life is given in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas, towards the end of their lives entered
<div n="lb"/>the forest and were travelling to the north. Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra who was walking in front, was followed by a dog.
<div n="lb"/>On the way the four brothers and Pāñcālī fell down
<div n="lb"/>dead. Dharmaputra continued his journey accompanied
[Page324-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>by the dog without turning back or looking behind. At
<div n="lb"/>the end of the journey, Indra was waiting for him with
<div n="lb"/>his chariot. He told Dharmaputra that his brothers and
<div n="lb"/>wife had already taken their places in Heaven and that
<div n="lb"/>he should leave behind the dog and get into the chariot
<div n="lb"/>to go to Devaloka. Dharmaputra pleaded that it was
<div n="lb"/>not right for him to enter Devaloka after deserting the
<div n="lb"/>dog which had followed him so far. Even though Indra
<div n="lb"/>pressed him very much to enter the chariot without the
<div n="lb"/>dog, Dharmaputra did not yield. At last the dog assum-
<div n="lb"/>ed the form of Yama who appeared and explained to
<div n="lb"/>them that he had taken the form of a dog and followed
<div n="lb"/>his son Dharmaputra to test his noble nature. They
<div n="lb"/>were all happy and all the three of them proceeded in
<div n="lb"/>the chariot to Devaloka. (M.B. Mahāprasthānika
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>52) {%Indra and Bāli.%} In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa there is a
<div n="lb"/>story as given below, about the birth of Bāli, a son of
<div n="lb"/>Indra:—
<div n="NI"/>Aruṇa, the charioteer of Sūrya (the sun-god) went one
<div n="lb"/>night to Indraloka to see the goddesses dancing. Men
<div n="lb"/>were not allowed to enter the dancing hall. So, Aruṇa
<div n="lb"/>managed to enter the hall by disguising himself as a
<div n="lb"/>beautiful lady. The moment Indra saw her he fell in
<div n="lb"/>love with her. The name she assumed at that time was
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇī. Indra secretly took her outside and they had a
<div n="lb"/>sexual union. Bāli was the son born from their union.
<div n="NI"/>53) {%Indra's theft of a Horse.%} A King named Sagara once
<div n="lb"/>performed a sacrifice. Devendra stole the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>horse. Sagara sent all his 60,000 sons in search of the
<div n="lb"/>horse. They dug up the earth and went to the Nether
<div n="lb"/>worlds where they saw the horse tied in front of the
<div n="lb"/>sage Kapila. The enraged sons of Sagara tried to
<div n="lb"/>capture and bind the sage. But Kapila reduced all
<div n="lb"/>the 60,000 princes to ashes by his curse. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Chapter 39).
<div n="NI"/>54) {%Indra cut an embryo to pieces.%} Diti and Aditi were
<div n="lb"/>the daughters of Dakṣa. Kaśyapa married them. Indra
<div n="lb"/>was born as the son of Aditi. At this birth of a son to
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, Diti became jealous of her sister. One day she
<div n="lb"/>told her husband Kaśyapa that she too wanted to have
<div n="lb"/>a virtuous, heroic and brave son who would be equal
<div n="lb"/>to Indra in every respect. Kaśyapa promised to grant
<div n="lb"/>her wish.
<div n="NI"/>In due course, Diti became pregnant. Now it was
<div n="lb"/>Aditi's turn to become jealous of Diti. She could not
<div n="lb"/>bear the thought of Diti having a son equal to her own
<div n="lb"/>son Indra, in glory and splendour. So she called Indra
<div n="lb"/>and secretly instructed him to destroy Diti's child in the
<div n="lb"/>womb, by whatever means.
<div n="NI"/>In obedience to his mother, Indra approached Diti
<div n="lb"/>pretending friendship and spent a lot of time in her
<div n="lb"/>company. He soon won her confidence and love by his
<div n="lb"/>affectionate attentions. On one occasion, when she was
<div n="lb"/>in sound sleep, Indra, by his mystic power, entered into
<div n="lb"/>Diti's womb with his weapon Vajra and cut the child
<div n="lb"/>in the womb into seven pieces. The child began to cry
<div n="lb"/>loudly, but Indra said “Mā ruda” which means “do
<div n="lb"/>not cry” and cut each of the pieces again into seven
<div n="lb"/>parts. Thus the embryo (child) was finally cut into
<div n="lb"/>fortynine pieces, which later became the fortynine
<div n="lb"/>“Mārutas” or “Maruts”. When she woke up, Diti
<div n="lb"/>realized Indra's treachery and in her fury she cursed
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Aditi. She cursed that Indra would lose his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom of Devaloka and that Aditi would be im-
[Page325-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>prisoned and her sons would be killed. As a result of
<div n="lb"/>this curse Devendra lost his kingdom on one occasion.
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, in her next birth, was born as Devakī, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva and was imprisoned by Kaṃsa who killed
<div n="lb"/>her children. (Devī Bhāgavata, Fourth Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>55) {%Indra and Aṃbarīṣa.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) King Aṃbarīṣa had a minister named Sudeva.
<div n="lb"/>Sudeva fell fighting in the battle-field. After some years,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃbarīṣa also died. When Aṃbarīṣa arrived in Heaven,
<div n="lb"/>he was surprised to find that Sudeva had already secured
<div n="lb"/>a place there long ago. Ambarīṣa had performed many
<div n="lb"/>more acts of holiness than Sudeva. Yet Sudeva attained
<div n="lb"/>Heaven earlier than Aṃbarīṣa. Aṃbarīṣa asked Indra
<div n="lb"/>why it was so. Indra answered that just as Aṃbarīṣa had
<div n="lb"/>performed many sacrifices, Sudeva had performed many
<div n="lb"/>war-sacrifices. He added that war-sacrifices were as
<div n="lb"/>efficacious for attaining Heaven as other kinds of sacrifices
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 98).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Aṃbarīṣa, King of Ayodhyā was performing a
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. At that time, Indra had stolen the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>animal. To continue the sacrifice without interruption,
<div n="lb"/>the King decided to substitute Śunaśśepha, the son of
<div n="lb"/>Ṛcīka, for the cow. But Śunaśśepha prayed to Indra
<div n="lb"/>who came and rescued him from the jaws of death.
<div n="lb"/>(This story is given in other Purāṇas with slight varia-
<div n="lb"/>tions. Vālṃīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 61st Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>56) {%Indra and Triśaṅku.%} There is a story that Indra
<div n="lb"/>once pushed down from Heaven, Triśaṅku a King of the
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya vaṃśa (Solar dynasty). See under TRIŚAṄKU.
<div n="NI"/>57) {%Indra and Viśvāmitra.%} Once Viśvāmitra observed a
<div n="lb"/>vow of silence for a period of one thousand years. At the
<div n="lb"/>end of that period, when he was about to take his food,
<div n="lb"/>Indra appeared in the form of a Brahmin and asked for
<div n="lb"/>that food. Viśvāmitra gave that food to the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>and resumed his austere penance. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bāla Kāṇḍa, 65th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>58) {%Indra, Śrī Rāma and Śarabhaṅga.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1). At the time when Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
<div n="lb"/>leading their life in the forest, one day Indra paid a visit
<div n="lb"/>to the Āśrama of the sage Śarabhaṅga. Devendra wished
<div n="lb"/>to take the sage with him to Devaloka. As they were
<div n="lb"/>talking, they saw Śrī Rāma coming to the Āśrama. Indra
<div n="lb"/>advised Śarabhaṅga to speak to Śrī Rāma and left the
<div n="lb"/>place. As suggested by Indra, the sage had a conversa-
<div n="lb"/>tion with Śrī Rāma. After it Śarabhaṅga offered his
<div n="lb"/>body to the fire and went to Devaloka. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, 5th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When the battle between Śrī Rāma and Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was in progress, Indra presented to Śrī Rāma, an
<div n="lb"/>excellent chariot along with the horses. The chariot and
<div n="lb"/>horses were handed over to Śrī Rāma on the battlefield
<div n="lb"/>by Mātali; Indra's charioteer. Śrī Rāma fought against
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa from that chariot and slew him. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 103).
<div n="NI"/>(3) After the war with Rāvaṇa, Indra appeared before
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma and asked him what boon he wanted. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma replied that all those monkeys who died in the
<div n="lb"/>war should come back to life and the forests in which
<div n="lb"/>they lived should abound in fruits and flowers in all the
<div n="lb"/>seasons of the year. Indra restored all those monkeys to
<div n="lb"/>life and made all the forests in which they lived, green
<div n="lb"/>and rich with luxuriant vegetation. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 129).
<div n="NI"/>59) {%Indra gives his sword for safe-custody.%} During their life
<div n="lb"/>in the forest Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, accompanied by
[Page325-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Sītā entered Daṇḍakāraṇya. Śrī Rāma's chief object in
<div n="lb"/>going there was to give protection to the sages and their
<div n="lb"/>hermitages in the forest. But seeing that he had made the
<div n="lb"/>killing of Rākṣasas his main purpose, Sītā told him that
<div n="lb"/>this change in the objective would spoil other important
<div n="lb"/>matters. To illustrate this she told him the following
<div n="lb"/>story:—
<div n="NI"/>‘Once upon a time, a great sage was observing holy
<div n="lb"/>rites with great austerity. Indra was alarmed at it. He
<div n="lb"/>went to the sage's hermitage in the form of a warrior
<div n="lb"/>armed with a sword. Indra handed over his sword to
<div n="lb"/>the sage for safe custody. The sage accepted it and
<div n="lb"/>from that time all his attention was concentrated on
<div n="lb"/>the sword. All his time was spent in guarding the
<div n="lb"/>sword and he began to neglect his devotional duties
<div n="lb"/>as a sage. As a result of it his mystic power declined
<div n="lb"/>and ultimately he fell into Hell. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇya Kāṇḍa, 9th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>60) {%Indra and Kabandha.%} See under Kabandha.
<div n="NI"/>61) {%The Post or Office of Indra.%} Indra was anointed as
<div n="lb"/>King of Devas on Meghavān mountain. In the 42nd
<div n="lb"/>Sarga of Kiṣkindhā kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa we
<div n="lb"/>find that Sugrīva had ordered the monkeys to search
<div n="lb"/>for Sītā on that mountain also.
<div n="NI"/>62) {%Indra and Maya.%} Maya, the carpenter of the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, performed penance to Brahmā and acquired
<div n="lb"/>complete mastery in the science of carpentry and
<div n="lb"/>architecture. After that he constructed a forest mansion
<div n="lb"/>of golden colour and took up his residence in it. Once
<div n="lb"/>Maya set his eyes on a goddess named Hemā. When
<div n="lb"/>Indra knew this he became angry and killed Maya
<div n="lb"/>with his weapon—Vajra. From that time Hemā got
<div n="lb"/>Maya's golden mansion. This was told by Hemā's
<div n="lb"/>maid, Svayaṃprabhā to Hanūmān. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, 51st Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>63). {%Indra cut off the wings of Mountains.%} In Kṛtayuga
<div n="lb"/>all the Mountains in the world had wings. They used
<div n="lb"/>to fly about here and there like Garuḍa with the
<div n="lb"/>speed of wind. The sages and the Devas feared that
<div n="lb"/>they might fall on their heads. The Devas held a con-
<div n="lb"/>ference and elected Indra to find a remedy for this.
<div n="lb"/>Indra cut off the wings of the mountains with his Vajra.
<div n="lb"/>The Maināka mountain was a friend of wind. When
<div n="lb"/>Indra was about to cut off the wings of that mountain,
<div n="lb"/>Wind suddenly removed it and deposited it in the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. It is out of his gratitude for this that the
<div n="lb"/>Maināka mountain rose up from the ocean and pro-
<div n="lb"/>vided a resting place for Hanūmān, the son of Wind
<div n="lb"/>god, when he jumped to Laṅkā. This story was told
<div n="lb"/>by Maināka mountain to Hanūmān. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, 1st Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>64) {%Indra cut off his preceptor's head%} Once Devendra
<div n="lb"/>accepted a sage named Viśvarūpa as his preceptor for
<div n="lb"/>a sacrifice. Viśvarūpa's mother was a Dānava partisan.
<div n="lb"/>So this priest, as directed by his mother, performed
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice with the prayer—“May the gods and the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras prosper.” As a result of the prayer, both the
<div n="lb"/>gods who performed the sacrifice and the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>who did not perform it, prospered. At this Devendra
<div n="lb"/>became furious and he cut off the head of the Guru.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, 3rd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>65) {%Indra and Mahiṣāsura.%} See under Mahiṣāsura.
<div n="NI"/>66) {%Indra became a bull.%} Long ago there was a King
<div n="lb"/>called Kakutstha in the Ikṣvāku dynasty. When he was
<div n="lb"/>ruling over the kingdom of Ayodhyā, a war broke
[Page326-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>out between Devas and Asuras. In that war, the Devas
<div n="lb"/>were not able to defeat the Asuras. Indra in distress
<div n="lb"/>approached Viṣṇu for refuge. Viṣṇu advised him to
<div n="lb"/>seek the help of Kakutstha, King of Ayodhyā. So Indra
<div n="lb"/>with the other gods went to Ayodhyā. When Kakutstha
<div n="lb"/>heard about their appeal for help, he gladly offered
<div n="lb"/>his help but only on condition that Indra became his
<div n="lb"/>vehicle. Seeing no other way, Indra assumed the
<div n="lb"/>form of a bull and Kakutstha, riding on the back of
<div n="lb"/>the bull fought against the Asuras and defeated them.
<div n="lb"/>It is from that day that the King came to be called
<div n="lb"/>“Kakutstha”, “Indra-vāhana” and “Purañjaya”. (His
<div n="lb"/>original name is unknown). “Kakut” means the “hamp
<div n="lb"/>of a bull”. Because he was seated on the “Kakut” he
<div n="lb"/>got the name “Kakutstha”. Because he made Indra
<div n="lb"/>“vāhana” (vehicle) he got the name of “Indravāhana”.
<div n="lb"/>As he defeated the Asuras and conquered their city
<div n="lb"/>(pura) he was called “Purañjaya”. Kakutstha was the
<div n="lb"/>son of Śaśāda and the father of Pṛthu. Śrī Rāma is
<div n="lb"/>called “Kākutstha” because he was born in the
<div n="lb"/>family of Kakutstha. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>67) {%Indra's Task.%} Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha says
<div n="lb"/>that Indra is one of the “Aṣṭadikpālakas (the eight
<div n="lb"/>protectors of the quarters) and the name of his city
<div n="lb"/>is “Amarāvatī”.
<div n="NI"/>68). {%Indra's term of Life.%} The Devī Bhāgavata 5th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha says that two life-spans of Brahmā make
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu's life-span. Śiva has double the life-span of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, that during the life of Brahmā, fourteen
<div n="lb"/>Indras will drop down from Heaven and perish, and
<div n="lb"/>one day of Brahmā is made up of one thousand
<div n="lb"/>“Caturyugas.”
<div n="NI"/>There are fourteen Manvantaras during the life of the
<div n="lb"/>present Brahmā (See under Manvantara). This means
<div n="lb"/>that fourteen Manus will be born and will die one
<div n="lb"/>after another during this period. Each Manvantara will
<div n="lb"/>have its own Indra and the Devas. The first Manu was
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva. After him five more Manus, Svārociṣa,
<div n="lb"/>Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata and Cākṣuṣa, have passed
<div n="lb"/>away. The present Manu is Vaivasvata the son of
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya. The current Vaivasvata Manvantara is the
<div n="lb"/>seventh. At the end of seven more Manvantaras, the
<div n="lb"/>present Brahmā will perish and a new Brahmā will
<div n="lb"/>be born. For the names of the Indras of different
<div n="lb"/>Manvantaras, see under Manvantara. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part 2, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>69) {%Indra became a Calf.%} (See under Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>70) {%The name Purandara.%} Sardar K.M. Panikkar
<div n="lb"/>in his preface to Ṛgveda Saṃhitā says that Indra
<div n="lb"/>got the name Purandara because he destroyed the
<div n="lb"/>cities (Puras) of the Dasyus. But in Chapter 71, of
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana Purāṇa, we are told that he got this name
<div n="lb"/>because he killed “Pura”, the son of Mahābali.
<div n="NI"/>71) {%Indra in the land of Koṅkaṇa.%} Once an Asura named
<div n="lb"/>Śūrapadma obtained from Brahmā, a boon to enable
<div n="lb"/>him to conquer the whole world. He persecuted the
<div n="lb"/>inhabitants of all the three worlds. He sent his followers
<div n="lb"/>to bring Indrāṇī (Indra's wife) to him as a captive.
<div n="lb"/>Indra, who came to know of this, secretly went away
<div n="lb"/>with Indrāṇī to the Koṅkaṇa land and lived in a
<div n="lb"/>temple there. After some days, entrusting Indrāṇī to
<div n="lb"/>the protection of Śāstā, he went to Kailāsa. Just at this
<div n="lb"/>time, Śūrapadma's sister Ajāmukhī came there and
<div n="lb"/>tempted Indrāṇī. Śāstā cut off the hands of Ajāmukhī
[Page326-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and took Indrāṇī to Kailāsa. (Skanda Purāṇa, Asura
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>72) {%Indra and Mucukunda.%} Mucukunda, a King of the
<div n="lb"/>Ikṣvāku dynasty, once went to Devaloka at the invita-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Indra. In the war between the Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, Mucukunda helped Indra and the Asuras were
<div n="lb"/>defeated. Indra was pleased and asked Mucukunda
<div n="lb"/>what boon he wanted. Mucukunda asked for a boon
<div n="lb"/>which would give him long and sound sleep. Indra
<div n="lb"/>granted it and in addition declared that anyone who
<div n="lb"/>disturbed Mucukunda's sleep would be reduced to
<div n="lb"/>ashes. After that Mucukunda went to sleep in a cave
<div n="lb"/>in the middle of a dense forest.
<div n="NI"/>A King of the tribe Yavana performed penance to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and obtained his boon which would enable
<div n="lb"/>him to defeat the Yādavas (Śrī Kṛṣṇa's clan) and
<div n="lb"/>he began to fight with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Because of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's boon, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was not able to kill him.
<div n="lb"/>He drove Yavana into the cave in which Mucukunda
<div n="lb"/>was sleeping. Mucukunda suddenly woke up from his
<div n="lb"/>sleep and looked at him with great anger. Yavana
<div n="lb"/>was at once reduced to ashes. (Bhāgavata, 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>73) {%Indra's favourite Drink.%} The juice of the Soma
<div n="lb"/>Plant is the favourite drink of Indra. (Ṛgveda, 1st
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka, 1st Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>74) {%Indra became a Goat.%} Sage Aṅgiras began wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipping the Devas, hoping to have a son who will be
<div n="lb"/>equal in glory to Indra. Indra who did not like
<div n="lb"/>another person to be his equal, took birth himself as
<div n="lb"/>the son of Aṅgiras. Savya is the name of that son.
<div n="lb"/>Once Savya assumed the form of a goat and ate up the
<div n="lb"/>soma plant of a sage called Medhātithi. The sage then
<div n="lb"/>called him Meṣa (goat). Indra is still known by the
<div n="lb"/>name, Meṣa. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka,
<div n="lb"/>5 1st Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>75) {%Indra turns woman.%} Once Indra took birth as the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of a king named Vṛṣaṇāśva and assumed the
<div n="lb"/>name Menā. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka,
<div n="lb"/>52nd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>76) {%Indra and Ṛjiśvan.%} Once Indra helped a King named
<div n="lb"/>Ṛjiśvā to defeat the Asuras, Karañja, Parṇaya and
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃgṛda. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka,
<div n="lb"/>53rd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>77) {%Indra and Sūrya.%} A King named Svaśva offered
<div n="lb"/>prayers to Sūrya to bless him with children. Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>himself took birth as his son. Once a great sage called
<div n="lb"/>Etaśa got involved in a fight with this son (Sūrya).
<div n="lb"/>When the sage was about to collapse, Indra came to
<div n="lb"/>his rescue. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 11th Anuvāka,
<div n="lb"/>62nd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>78) {%Indra and Saramā.%} Once an asura called Paṇi stole
<div n="lb"/>some cows and hid them in some unknown place. Indra
<div n="lb"/>asked Saramā, the bitch of the Devas to find out and
<div n="lb"/>inform him where the cows were kept concealed. Sara-
<div n="lb"/>mā replied that she was prepared to do so, if Indra
<div n="lb"/>would give milk to her child and look after it in her
<div n="lb"/>absence. Indra undertook that task and the bitch went
<div n="lb"/>out and found out the place where the cows were hidden
<div n="lb"/>and reported it to Indra, (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 11th
<div n="lb"/>Anuvāka, 62nd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>79) {%Indra and Dadhīca.%} Dadhīca (Dadhīci) was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Atharva. He used to scare away the Asuras by his
<div n="lb"/>terrible look. Once when he had gone to Heaven, the
<div n="lb"/>earth became infested with Asuras. Indra set out to
[Page327-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>fight them. He tried to find out whether Dadhīca had
<div n="lb"/>left behind anything to be used as a weapon. “Dadhīca
<div n="lb"/>had with him a horse-head”, he was told. Indra went in
<div n="lb"/>search of it and at last found it in a lake at a place
<div n="lb"/>called Śaraṇya. It is with its bone that he killed the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 13th Anuvāka, 84th
<div n="lb"/>Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>80) {%Indra and Dadhyaṅ.%} Indra taught Madhuvidyā
<div n="lb"/>(The science of intoxicating drinks) to Dadhyaṅ. He
<div n="lb"/>was warned by Indra that if he communicated that
<div n="lb"/>lore to anyone else, his head would be cut off. Once
<div n="lb"/>the Aśvinīs wanted to learn it. Since Indra had denied
<div n="lb"/>Soma drinking to Aśvinīs, they were not on good terms
<div n="lb"/>with Indra. So they approached Dadhyaṅ to acquire
<div n="lb"/>that Knowledge. But he refused to teach them due to
<div n="lb"/>his fear that Indra would cut off his head. So the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīs cut off Dadhyaṅ's head and fixed a horse's
<div n="lb"/>head in its place. With that horse-head Dadhyaṅ
<div n="lb"/>taught the Aśvinīs Madhu Vidyā. After they had learnt
<div n="lb"/>the knowledge, they replaced his own head after remo-
<div n="lb"/>ving the horse-head. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 17th
<div n="lb"/>Anuvāka, 116th Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>81) It is said that once, in a light mood, Indra made
<div n="lb"/>a mare give birth to a cow. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala,
<div n="lb"/>18th Anuvāka, 121st Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>82) {%Indra and Śatānīka.%} Śatānīka was a King of the
<div n="lb"/>Lunar dynasty who ruled over the city of Kauśāmbī.
<div n="lb"/>Indra who was highly impressed by his heroic
<div n="lb"/>exploits once invited him to Devaloka to suppress
<div n="lb"/>the Asuras. In the war with Asuras, Śatānīka was
<div n="lb"/>killed. After that Śatānīka's son, Sahasrānīka went to
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka and killed the Asuras. Indra who was pleased
<div n="lb"/>declared that Sahasrānīka would marry the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgāvatī and they were married. See under Mṛgāvatī.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāmukha laṃbaka, 1st Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>83) {%Indra and Vāsavadattā.%} Vāsavadattā who was the
<div n="lb"/>wife of Udayana was born in the world by Indra's
<div n="lb"/>blessing. See under “Vāsavadattā”. (Kathāsaritsāgara,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāmukha laṃbaka, 1st Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>84) {%Indra and Meghanāda.%} Rāvaṇa conquered the
<div n="lb"/>world with the help of Brahmā's blessing. In his pride
<div n="lb"/>he came into conflict with Indra. After a fierce battle,
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa's son, Meghanāda defeated Indra. He took
<div n="lb"/>Indra to Laṅkā as a prisoner. Rāvaṇa chained Īndra's
<div n="lb"/>hands and feet and tied him to his flagstaff. The Devas
<div n="lb"/>in distress approached Brahmā for help. Brahmā went
<div n="lb"/>to Laṅkā and secured the release of Indra. After giving
<div n="lb"/>the title of Indrajit to Meghanāda, Brahmā returned to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaloka.
<div n="NI"/>Sometime before this Devendra had committed adultery
<div n="lb"/>with Ahalyā, Sage Gautama's wife. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Gautama had uttered a curse on him, that he would
<div n="lb"/>have to spend a year in prison, chained by an enemy.
<div n="lb"/>His life in Rāvaṇa's prison in Laṅkā was in fulfilment
<div n="lb"/>of that curse. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>85) {%Indra and Hanūmān.%} Hanūmān, the son of Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>(wind) sprang up into the sky as soon as he was born,
<div n="lb"/>seeing the brilliant rising sun, and mistaking it to be
<div n="lb"/>some delicious food. He saw Rāhu who was standing
<div n="lb"/>near the sun and made a leap towards him. When
<div n="lb"/>he came near, he saw Airāvata, Indra's elephant,
<div n="lb"/>standing in Devaloka. At once he turned towards that
<div n="lb"/>elephant to swallow him. Seeing the struggle between
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān and Airāvata Indra used his weapon Vajra
<div n="lb"/>which cut the monkey's “hanu” (jaw bone) and he fell
[Page327-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>down dead on the earth. Vāyu, in deep sorrow, took
<div n="lb"/>the dead body of his son and went to Pātāla. When
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu (wind) left the world, the creatures of the world
<div n="lb"/>underwent great suffering. Then the Devas led by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā went to Pātāla, consoled Vāyu and revived
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān. Since his “Hanu” was cut with Vajra, the
<div n="lb"/>monkey was named “Hanūmān” by Indra. Besides,
<div n="lb"/>Indra gave him a blessing that Hanūmān would die
<div n="lb"/>only when he wished. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa; Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa; 66th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>86) {%Indra and Govardhana.%} For the story of how the
<div n="lb"/>people of Gokula (Cowherds' colony) stopped the wor-
<div n="lb"/>ship of Indra, how Indra caused a heavy shower of rain,
<div n="lb"/>and how Śrī Kṛṣṇa used the Govardhana mountain as
<div n="lb"/>an umbrella, see under “Kṛṣṇa”.
<div n="NI"/>87) {%Indra becomes victim of old age.%} Once the sage
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas went to Devaloka. The goddesses gave him a
<div n="lb"/>grand reception at which Menakā presented him with
<div n="lb"/>a garland made of fragrant flowers. The sage gave it to
<div n="lb"/>Devendra. Indra placed it on Airāvata's tusk. The
<div n="lb"/>fragrance of the garland attracted a large number of
<div n="lb"/>bees to it. They swarmed round the head of the ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant and annoyed it. Airāvata picked up the garland
<div n="lb"/>trampled it under his foot, pulled it to pieces and threw
<div n="lb"/>it away. Durvāsas took this as an insult to himself and
<div n="lb"/>pronounced a curse that all the gods would be subject-
<div n="lb"/>ed to wrinkles and grey hair of old age.
<div n="NI"/>Indra and the other gods fell victims to old age. Indra
<div n="lb"/>requested Durvāsas to release him from his curse. The
<div n="lb"/>sage relented and told him that if the Devas drank
<div n="lb"/>Amṛta obtained by churning the ocean of milk they
<div n="lb"/>would recover their youth. Accordingly, the ocean of
<div n="lb"/>milk was churned by the joint effort of the Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Asuras and in the end the Devas snatched it away.
<div n="lb"/>When the Devas drank Amṛta, the symptoms of old age
<div n="lb"/>disappeared and they recovered their youth. (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyana).
<div n="NI"/>88) {%Indra and Daṇḍakāraṇya.%} Daṇḍa the son of Ikṣvāku,
<div n="lb"/>a King of the Solar dynasty, ruled over the territory
<div n="lb"/>between the Vindhya and the Himālayas. Once when
<div n="lb"/>he was out ahunting in the neighbourhood of the moun-
<div n="lb"/>tains, he saw a charming woman. She was “Arā”, the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of the sage Śukra. The King was fascinated
<div n="lb"/>by her beauty and fell desperately in love with her at
<div n="lb"/>the very first sight. He seized her by force and commi-
<div n="lb"/>tted rape on her. When Śukra knew about this, he was
<div n="lb"/>furious and uttered a curse that Indra should shower
<div n="lb"/>a rain of fire on Daṇḍa's kingdom. Thus the whole
<div n="lb"/>country of Daṇḍa was destroyed by Indra's rain of fire.
<div n="lb"/>In course of time that region was turned into a dense
<div n="lb"/>forest and came to be called “Daṇḍakāraṇya”. (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>89) {%Other names of Indra.%} Indra; Marutvān, Maghavān,

<div n="NI"/>90) {%Indra's Divinity.%} In the earliest stage of Hinduism,
<div n="lb"/>Indra had occupied one of the most eminent places
<div n="lb"/>among the gods. Mahāviṣṇu had only the place of
<div n="lb"/>younger brother of Indra at that time. In Amara Kośa
<div n="lb"/>we find “Upendra Indrāvaraja” as the synonym of
[Page328-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. In Ṛgveda Indra has a more important place.
<div n="lb"/>Although Rudra is a divinity or deity and although
<div n="lb"/>there are references to Kapardin, there is not even a
<div n="lb"/>single stuti (praise) about Śiva in the Ṛgveda. Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda does not recognize Devīpūjā and idol worship.
<div n="lb"/>But in the Purāṇic age, Indra was transformed into a
<div n="lb"/>lascivious “Deva Prabhu” (Lord among the gods).
<div n="lb"/>Sardar K.M. Panikkar, in his preface to “Ṛgveda
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā” says about Indra:—“The main actor in Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda is Indra. In the war against the Dasyus the Āryas
<div n="lb"/>seek the help chiefly of Indra. Indra is represented as
<div n="lb"/>very handsome and of a golden complexion. His weapon
<div n="lb"/>is Vajra, thunderbolt which was made by Tvaṣṭā.
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu (wind) is his charioteer. He is constantly travel-
<div n="lb"/>ling about in the sky driving in his golden chariot. Indra
<div n="lb"/>likes drinking Soma juice more than the other gods.
<div n="lb"/>Indra is even referred to as “Somapa”. He is also
<div n="lb"/>sometimes described as the twin brother of Agni. Sages
<div n="lb"/>have sung unendingly about the exploits of Indra.
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyastūpa, a sage, has composed a work entitled
<div n="lb"/>“Indrastuti” which celebrates many of the heroic deeds
<div n="lb"/>of Indra. Indra was Vajrapāṇi who had slain the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>like Ahi, Tuṣṇa, Śaṃbara, Vala, Vṛtra and others.
<div n="NI"/>There are also several stories in the Vedas about the
<div n="lb"/>birth of this hero. At the time of Indra's birth, some-
<div n="lb"/>how, his mother felt that he was incapable of being
<div n="lb"/>killed. So she decided to abandon him. Fearing trouble
<div n="lb"/>for herself, she asked the child to leave her and go to
<div n="lb"/>some other place. Indra refused to do so and followed
<div n="lb"/>her to the house of Tvaṣṭā. There he drank the juice
<div n="lb"/>of the soma plant and gained strength to kill his ene-
<div n="lb"/>mies. But unaware of this, his mother, tried to keep
<div n="lb"/>him concealed. Indra, however, came out of the place
<div n="lb"/>in his dazzling attire and encountered the enemies.
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra who met Indra got ready for a fight. In the fight
<div n="lb"/>Vyaṃsa struck down Indra. The devas fled in fear.
<div n="lb"/>Indra who was left alone called upon Viṣṇu and sought
<div n="lb"/>his aid.
<div n="NI"/>Although Indra needed help in his fight with Vṛtra, he
<div n="lb"/>was the chief support to the Ārynas in their fight against
<div n="lb"/>the Dasyus. It was Indra's Vajra which broke up the for-
<div n="lb"/>tresses of many Dasyu kings. That was why he got the
<div n="lb"/>name “Purandara”. Once Indra dried up the whole
<div n="lb"/>river to enable his army to cross it for the sake of Sud-
<div n="lb"/>ās. When Suśravas became helpless, Indra destroyed
<div n="lb"/>twenty kings and 60099 soldiers with his chariot wheel.
<div n="lb"/>Thus we see Indra in the Ṛgveda as the destroyer of
<div n="lb"/>the Dasyus and the protector of Āryans.”
<div n="NI"/>Indrāṇī, Śacī and Pulomajā are the names of Indra's
<div n="lb"/>wife. Indra's son, Jayanta is also known by the name
<div n="lb"/>of Pākaśāsani. Indra's city is Amarāvatī; his chariot
<div n="lb"/>“Vimāna”, his charioteer Mātali, and his garden Nan-
<div n="lb"/>danavana. “Vaijayanta” is the name of his mansion.
<div n="lb"/>Indra's weapon has several other names, such as, Hrā-
<div n="lb"/>dinī, Kuliśa, Bhidura, Pavi, Śatakoṭi, Svaru, Śāmba,
<div n="lb"/>Dambholi, Aśani etc. Indra's assembly is called “Su-
<div n="lb"/>dharmā”. Indra's bow is the rainbow, his sword is
<div n="lb"/>Parañjaya and his residence is Heaven. The trees in
<div n="lb"/>Heaven are, Mandāra, Pārijāta, Santāna, Kalpavṛkṣa
<div n="lb"/>and Haricandana. The festival celebrated in honour of
<div n="lb"/>Indra is called “Śakradhvajotthāna” or “Indrotsava”.

<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇya defeated the gods in a battle and took
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Indrāṇī to Pātāla as captives. The
<div n="lb"/>Devas who knew that Mahāśani was a relative of
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, sought the help of Varuṇa. At the instance. of
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, Indra was released. The revengeful
<div n="lb"/>Indra prayed to Śiva. Śiva appeared and asked Indra
<div n="lb"/>to submit his complaint to Viṣṇu. Indra offered his
<div n="lb"/>prayers to Viṣṇu. As a result of it, a man who had the
<div n="lb"/>elements of Śiva and Viṣṇu, in him, took his birth from
<div n="lb"/>the water of the Gaṅgā. He killed Mahāśani. (Brah-
<div n="lb"/>māṇḍa Purāṇa).
