TĀṬAKĀ¦. A fierce demoness. It was because of a curse
<div n="lb"/>of the sage Agastya that Tāṭakā became a demoness.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a great Yakṣa named Suketu, a son of
<div n="lb"/>Surakṣa. He did penance to propitiate Brahmā to get
<div n="lb"/>a child and by the blessing of Brahmā Suketu got a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Tāṭakā. Brahmā gave her the strength
<div n="lb"/>of a thousand elephants. Taṭakā was by nature interest-
<div n="lb"/>ed in cruel and violent deeds and doing deeds of magic.
<div n="lb"/>She made Sunda, son of Jharjha, her husband. She got
<div n="lb"/>two sons named Mārīca and Subāhu. They also became
<div n="lb"/>mighty ones great in deeds by magic.
<div n="NI"/>Once Sunda attacked the āśrama of Agastya in a mood
<div n="lb"/>of intoxicated arrogance. Sunda was burnt to death in
<div n="lb"/>the fire of his fury. Tāṭakā coming to know of the death
<div n="lb"/>of her husband got angry and attacked the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Agastya with her sons. Agastya cursed them and made
<div n="lb"/>them into demons. Tāṭakā and her sons who immedia-
<div n="lb"/>tely turned themselves into fierce-looking demons went
<div n="lb"/>first to Pātāla with Sumālī, father of the demon race
<div n="lb"/>and then went with Rāvaṇa, King of the demons, to
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā and stayed there. With the help of Rāvaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Tāṭakā conquered the great deep forest near Kārūṣa and
<div n="lb"/>stayed there with her sons. None, devas, demons
<div n="lb"/>or men, dared to step into that forest. Even the Sun
<div n="lb"/>or Clouds avoided passing above that forest.
<div n="NI"/>It was at that time that Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa came
<div n="lb"/>to that forest with Viśvāmitra. Tāṭakā attacked Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Rāma killed her with one arrow. The heavy body
<div n="lb"/>of the demoness fell to the ground like a big mountain.
<div n="lb"/>Her soul then rose up as a beautiful Gandharva lady
<div n="lb"/>and Tāṭakā who was thus released from the curse praised
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma and left the place. Chapters 24 to 26 of Bāla
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa and Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
