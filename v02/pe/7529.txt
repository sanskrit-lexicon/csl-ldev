TĀṬAKĀ¦. A fierce demoness. It was because of a curse
of the sage Agastya that Tāṭakā became a demoness.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a great Yakṣa named Suketu, a son of
Surakṣa. He did penance to propitiate Brahmā to get
a child and by the blessing of Brahmā Suketu got a
daughter named Tāṭakā. Brahmā gave her the strength
of a thousand elephants. Taṭakā was by nature interest-
ed in cruel and violent deeds and doing deeds of magic.
She made Sunda, son of Jharjha, her husband. She got
two sons named Mārīca and Subāhu. They also became
mighty ones great in deeds by magic.
<div n="NI"/>Once Sunda attacked the āśrama of Agastya in a mood
of intoxicated arrogance. Sunda was burnt to death in
the fire of his fury. Tāṭakā coming to know of the death
of her husband got angry and attacked the āśrama of
Agastya with her sons. Agastya cursed them and made
them into demons. Tāṭakā and her sons who immedia-
tely turned themselves into fierce-looking demons went
first to Pātāla with Sumālī, father of the demon race
and then went with Rāvaṇa, King of the demons, to
Laṅkā and stayed there. With the help of Rāvaṇa,
Tāṭakā conquered the great deep forest near Kārūṣa and
stayed there with her sons. None, devas, demons
or men, dared to step into that forest. Even the Sun
or Clouds avoided passing above that forest.
<div n="NI"/>It was at that time that Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa came
to that forest with Viśvāmitra. Tāṭakā attacked Śrī Rāma
and Rāma killed her with one arrow. The heavy body
of the demoness fell to the ground like a big mountain.
Her soul then rose up as a beautiful Gandharva lady
and Tāṭakā who was thus released from the curse praised
Śrī Rāma and left the place. Chapters 24 to 26 of Bāla
Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa and Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
