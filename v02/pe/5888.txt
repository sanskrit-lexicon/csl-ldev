SAGARA¦. A king of the solar dynasty, Sagara ruled
Ayodhyā.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Bāhuka, father of Sagara, was known as
Subāhu also. Sagara was Bāhuka's son by his wife,
Yādavī. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 16). Though
Sagara was a prince he was born at the āśrama of
Aurva, and there was a reason for it.
<div n="NI"/>Subāhu and Yādavī did not have a child for long. But,
as a result of many yajñas conducted for the gift of a
child, Yādavī conceived. While she was in the seventh
month of her pregnancy her co-wife administered poison
to her with the result that she did not further advance
in pregnancy and deliver in due time. Thus she con-
tinued as a pregnant woman for seven years. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapter 16). The King became an old man.
During this period Tālajaṅgha, king of Hehaya, at-
tacked Ayodhyā with his army, and Subāhu, despite his
old age, fought back. But the fighting grew fiercer.
Subāhu found that he would not be able to defeat
Tālajaṅgha and so he escaped into the forest with his
[Page662-b+ 63]
wife Yādavī. They took shelter in the āśrama of sage
Aurva. Subāhu expired there due to old age and
Yādavī got ready to follow him in his pyre. The Muni
prevented her from doing so by pointing out to her
that the child in her womb was a very fortunate one
and would become emperor of the seven islands when
he grew up to manhood. Yādavī delivered shortly.
As the poison (gara) given to her by the co-wife had
immobilised her pregnancy for so long Aurva named
her child Sagara. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters 16
and 17).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%To Ayodhyā.%} Sage Aurva conducted the Upanayana
ceremony of the boy and taught him the Vedas ete.
Once Yādavī wept to hear the boy address the muni
‘father’, and when the son asked her the reason for it
she told him that the muni was not his father, who
was really greater than the muni. She also told him
their previous history, and Sagara decided to return to
Ayodhyā somehow.
<div n="NI"/>The people of Ayodhyā lived scattered here and there
in fear of Tālajaṅgha, and disgusted with such an exis-
tence, they came together and took refuge with Vasiṣ-
ṭha, who told them that king Subāhu had expired in
Aurvāśrama, but that his son Sagara was there in
the āśrama. He further advised them to bring Sagara
back and reconquer Ayodhyā. Yādavī wept at the
sight of the people from Ayodhyā and they insisted
upon Sagara's return to the state as their king. They
waited in the āśrama for five days for Sagara. Then
Sagara and his mother, with the blessings of the Sage,
returned to Ayodhyā along with the people. Sagara
fought Tālajaṅgha, reconquered Ayodhyā and crowned
himself as king. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters 20 to 23).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family life.%} Sagara had two wives called Sumati
alias Vaidarbhī and Keśinī alias Śaibyā. Sumati was
the daughter of Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>As he had no issues for long, Sagara, with his wives,
went to Himālayas and began doing tapas at Bhṛgupra-
sravaṇa mountain. After hundred years Bhṛgu
appeared and blessed Sagara that one of his wives would
give birth to 60,000 sons and the other to one, who
would add to the glory of the dynasty. Sumati chose
60,000 sons and Keśinī the one son.
<div n="NI"/>The king and the queens returned to Ayodhyā and in
due course Sumati delivered the son called Asamañjasa
who was to bring prosperity to the dynasty. Sumati
gave birth to a lump of flesh, which developed into
60,000 children. They were put in pots of ghee and
they grew up to become young persons. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakānḍa, Canto 33).
<div n="NI"/>Some Purāṇas contain stories somewhat different from
the above about the birth of the 60,000 children.
e.g. in the 9th Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata, the story
is related as follows; “Keśinī delivered the son
Asamañjasa and Sumati did not deliver at all. So she
did tapas for Śiva for children and because of his bless-
ing she conceived. Sumati delivered only hundred
years after continuing to be pregnant, and even that
was only a piece of flesh, and she began weeping add-
ressing Śiva, who appeared before her and cut the
mass of flesh into 60,000 parts. Each piece of flesh
transformed itself into a very powerful and effulgent
man.

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Loss of children.%} Kapila turned into ashes the
60,000 sons of Sagara. Bhagīratha revived them. (For
details see under Bhagīratha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Triumphal tour.%} Sagara ruled the kingdom well and
while living happily thus with his sons, he set out on a
triumphal tour. After conquering the northern regions
he moved towards the south, his object being Māhiṣ-
matī, Kingdom of the Hehayas. He destroyed the
Hehayas completely in battle. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chapters 89 and 90).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Evening of life.%} Sagara ruled the kingdom for 300
years. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 91). His son,
Asamañjasa was a tormentor of his subjects. In the
evening of his life, Sagara transmitted the throne to
his grandson Aṃśumān (son of Asamañjasa). The
rest of his life he spent in Aurvāśrama with his wife
engaged in meditation.
