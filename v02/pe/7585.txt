TRILOKĪTILAKA¦. A Yogeśvarī mantra. If one mutters
this mantra (a sacred prayer addressed to a deity) one
hundred and one times daily, one will become omnis-
cient. Not only that, he would be able to move about
to any place he wants. The mantra is this: “Hrīṃ
Gaurī, Rudramayī te yogeśvari hum phaṭ Svāhā” (6th
Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
