BALA¦ IX. A son of Māyāsura. He lived in a place in
the netherlands called Atala. He created ninety-six
different kinds of magic and gave them to the asura
magicians who by the use of them gave the devas
immense trouble.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Balāsura yawned three bad women, Svairiṇī,
Kāminī and Puṃścalī were born. They had with them
a potable substance called Hāṭaka which they gave to
men whom they liked and after enlivening the sex
impulse in them enjoyed a sexual life with them to
their heart's content. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
Once during a fight between Indra and Jalandhara
Bala defeated Indra in a pathetic way. Indra then sought
refuge in him and praised him with songs. Flattered
by this Bala asked Indra to ask of him whatever he
wanted and the sly Indra requested for the physical
body of Bala. Without the least hesitation Bala cut his
body into pieces and gave him. Indra threw away the
cut pieces to different sides and all the places where
these pieces fell were at once transformed into Diamond
mines.

Dorbhyām Bakaṃ Kaṃsasakhaṃ satām patiḥ

[Page099-b+ 58]
After the death of Balāsura his wife Prabhāvatī went
to their preceptor (Kulaguru) Śukrācārya and told
him all that took place and requested to bring back to
life her lost husband. But Śukrācārya regretted that he
could not give life again to her dead husband but could
by his powers make her hear his voice again. Prabhā-
vatī agreed to that and then she heard her husband say
“Leave your body and join me”. Prabhāvatī immediate-
ly courted death and joining Bala became a river.
(Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 6).
