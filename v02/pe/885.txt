BALA¦ IX. A son of Māyāsura. He lived in a place in
<div n="lb"/>the netherlands called Atala. He created ninety-six
<div n="lb"/>different kinds of magic and gave them to the asura
<div n="lb"/>magicians who by the use of them gave the devas
<div n="lb"/>immense trouble.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Balāsura yawned three bad women, Svairiṇī,
<div n="lb"/>Kāminī and Puṃścalī were born. They had with them
<div n="lb"/>a potable substance called Hāṭaka which they gave to
<div n="lb"/>men whom they liked and after enlivening the sex
<div n="lb"/>impulse in them enjoyed a sexual life with them to
<div n="lb"/>their heart's content. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="lb"/>Once during a fight between Indra and Jalandhara
<div n="lb"/>Bala defeated Indra in a pathetic way. Indra then sought
<div n="lb"/>refuge in him and praised him with songs. Flattered
<div n="lb"/>by this Bala asked Indra to ask of him whatever he
<div n="lb"/>wanted and the sly Indra requested for the physical
<div n="lb"/>body of Bala. Without the least hesitation Bala cut his
<div n="lb"/>body into pieces and gave him. Indra threw away the
<div n="lb"/>cut pieces to different sides and all the places where
<div n="lb"/>these pieces fell were at once transformed into Diamond
<div n="lb"/>mines.

<div n="lb"/>After the death of Balāsura his wife Prabhāvatī went
<div n="lb"/>to their preceptor (Kulaguru) Śukrācārya and told
<div n="lb"/>him all that took place and requested to bring back to
<div n="lb"/>life her lost husband. But Śukrācārya regretted that he
<div n="lb"/>could not give life again to her dead husband but could
<div n="lb"/>by his powers make her hear his voice again. Prabhā-
<div n="lb"/>vatī agreed to that and then she heard her husband say
<div n="lb"/>“Leave your body and join me”. Prabhāvatī immediate-
<div n="lb"/>ly courted death and joining Bala became a river.
