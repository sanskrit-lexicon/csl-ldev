ṢAḌGUṆA II¦. Six kingly or political policies. Sandhi,
Vigraha, Yāna, Āsana, Dvaidha and Āśraya are the six
policies of state-craft. (Manusmrti, Chapter 8, Verse
160)
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Sandhi.%} To enter into peace and concord with the
enemy is Sandhi. One may make peace for one's own
benefit with the enemy, who is powerful and is fighting.
There are sixteen kinds of sandhi called Kapālasandhi,
etc. No kind of peace or treaty should be made with
twenty kinds of kings, i.e. infants; old men; one suffer-
ing from chronic disease; cast out by one's own people;
coward; one whose supporters are cowards; miser; one
whose people are misers; who is very much addicted to
women and such other material things; one, who has
not a mind of one's own and is ruled by more than one
adviser; he, who does not respect Devas and brahmins;
one hated or forsaken by God; blasphemer; one subject
to scarcity and sorrow; one not with satisfactory army;
local person; one with many enemies; one whose days are
numbered and one devoid of truth and righteousness.
One shall only fight and not enter into peace with the
above types of people.
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Vigraha.%} Fighting, i.e. war is vigraha. War is the
result of mutual evil-doings. The king, who desires pros-
perity who is troubled by others and in whose favour
time and circumstances are, should go in for
war. The main causes of war are the following:
[Page661-b+ 65]
the desire to capture kingdom, woman, position
etc. haughtiness and imperiousness, obstruction to
duties and rights, the interest of friends and allies,
destruction to one's allies, both parties getting interested
in one and the same thing etc. Enmity is engendered
chiefly due to the following causes:-rivalry of co-wives,
disputes about property and women, verbal controversies
and wrongs committed. The following kinds of wars
should not be fought:-Wars the benefit of which is
meagre or futile; war which would cause harm in the
present as also in future; with the enemy whose strength
is not correctly known; incited by others, for others, on
account of women, which would continue for long; with
brahmins, where time and fate are not in favour;
with him, who has powerful allies, though of temporary
advantage but which will not be so in future; though
of advantage in future but useless at present.
<div n="NI"/>The king should always do what will be of advantage
at present as also in future. If one's own army is strong
and enthusiastic and when the army of the adversary is
not so, one may go in for war. Also, when all circum-
stances are in one's favour and against the antagonist
one may fight.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Yāna.%} Yāna means marching for war. One may
start for war after declaring it, after making peace, after
making alliances; and incidentally also.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Āsana.%} To remain quiet or doing nothing which is
also of four kinds as yāna.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Dvaidha.%} To get in between the contending parties
to support with words only and to remain without join-
ing either side is dvaidha. He who takes up the stand
should, on meeting both the parties, serve the stronger
side. But if he finds that both the parties are making
peace, and not in need of his aid, he should approach
their enemy, who is more powerful than they, or he
should fight by himself.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Āśraya.%} When one is attacked by a stronger enemy
and if one finds no means to retaliate, one should depend
upon another person, who is noble, truthful and power-
ful. To put on a supplicant's look, to understand the
moods of that person whose help is sought and to be
humble to him—these are the characteristics and traits of
the dependent. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 240.
