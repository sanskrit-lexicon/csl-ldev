ṢAḌGUṆA II¦. Six kingly or political policies. Sandhi,
<div n="lb"/>Vigraha, Yāna, Āsana, Dvaidha and Āśraya are the six
<div n="lb"/>policies of state-craft. (Manusmrti, Chapter 8, Verse
<div n="lb"/>160)
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Sandhi.%} To enter into peace and concord with the
<div n="lb"/>enemy is Sandhi. One may make peace for one's own
<div n="lb"/>benefit with the enemy, who is powerful and is fighting.
<div n="lb"/>There are sixteen kinds of sandhi called Kapālasandhi,
<div n="lb"/>etc. No kind of peace or treaty should be made with
<div n="lb"/>twenty kinds of kings, i.e. infants; old men; one suffer-
<div n="lb"/>ing from chronic disease; cast out by one's own people;
<div n="lb"/>coward; one whose supporters are cowards; miser; one
<div n="lb"/>whose people are misers; who is very much addicted to
<div n="lb"/>women and such other material things; one, who has
<div n="lb"/>not a mind of one's own and is ruled by more than one
<div n="lb"/>adviser; he, who does not respect Devas and brahmins;
<div n="lb"/>one hated or forsaken by God; blasphemer; one subject
<div n="lb"/>to scarcity and sorrow; one not with satisfactory army;
<div n="lb"/>local person; one with many enemies; one whose days are
<div n="lb"/>numbered and one devoid of truth and righteousness.
<div n="lb"/>One shall only fight and not enter into peace with the
<div n="lb"/>above types of people.
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Vigraha.%} Fighting, i.e. war is vigraha. War is the
<div n="lb"/>result of mutual evil-doings. The king, who desires pros-
<div n="lb"/>perity who is troubled by others and in whose favour
<div n="lb"/>time and circumstances are, should go in for
<div n="lb"/>war. The main causes of war are the following:
[Page661-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the desire to capture kingdom, woman, position
<div n="lb"/>etc. haughtiness and imperiousness, obstruction to
<div n="lb"/>duties and rights, the interest of friends and allies,
<div n="lb"/>destruction to one's allies, both parties getting interested
<div n="lb"/>in one and the same thing etc. Enmity is engendered
<div n="lb"/>chiefly due to the following causes:-rivalry of co-wives,
<div n="lb"/>disputes about property and women, verbal controversies
<div n="lb"/>and wrongs committed. The following kinds of wars
<div n="lb"/>should not be fought:-Wars the benefit of which is
<div n="lb"/>meagre or futile; war which would cause harm in the
<div n="lb"/>present as also in future; with the enemy whose strength
<div n="lb"/>is not correctly known; incited by others, for others, on
<div n="lb"/>account of women, which would continue for long; with
<div n="lb"/>brahmins, where time and fate are not in favour;
<div n="lb"/>with him, who has powerful allies, though of temporary
<div n="lb"/>advantage but which will not be so in future; though
<div n="lb"/>of advantage in future but useless at present.
<div n="NI"/>The king should always do what will be of advantage
<div n="lb"/>at present as also in future. If one's own army is strong
<div n="lb"/>and enthusiastic and when the army of the adversary is
<div n="lb"/>not so, one may go in for war. Also, when all circum-
<div n="lb"/>stances are in one's favour and against the antagonist
<div n="lb"/>one may fight.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Yāna.%} Yāna means marching for war. One may
<div n="lb"/>start for war after declaring it, after making peace, after
<div n="lb"/>making alliances; and incidentally also.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Āsana.%} To remain quiet or doing nothing which is
<div n="lb"/>also of four kinds as yāna.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Dvaidha.%} To get in between the contending parties
<div n="lb"/>to support with words only and to remain without join-
<div n="lb"/>ing either side is dvaidha. He who takes up the stand
<div n="lb"/>should, on meeting both the parties, serve the stronger
<div n="lb"/>side. But if he finds that both the parties are making
<div n="lb"/>peace, and not in need of his aid, he should approach
<div n="lb"/>their enemy, who is more powerful than they, or he
<div n="lb"/>should fight by himself.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Āśraya.%} When one is attacked by a stronger enemy
<div n="lb"/>and if one finds no means to retaliate, one should depend
<div n="lb"/>upon another person, who is noble, truthful and power-
<div n="lb"/>ful. To put on a supplicant's look, to understand the
<div n="lb"/>moods of that person whose help is sought and to be
<div n="lb"/>humble to him—these are the characteristics and traits of
<div n="lb"/>the dependent. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 240.
