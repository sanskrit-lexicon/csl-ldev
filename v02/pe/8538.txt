VIŚVAKARMĀ¦. The architect of the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Viśvakarmā is the son of Prabhāsa, the
eighth of the Eight Vasus. Varastrī, the sister of
Bṛhaspati, a celibate woman who had attained Yoga-
siddhi (union with the Universal Soul) and travelled
all over the world was the wife of Prabhāsa. Prajāpati
Viśvakarmā was born to Prabhāsa by Varastrī. This
Viśvakarmā was the inventor of innumerable kinds of
handicrafts, the architect of the gods, maker of all
kinds of ornaments, and the most famous sculptor. He
was the maker of all the aerial chariots of the Devas.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Children.%} Though mention is made about many
children of Viśvakarmā in Various Purāṇas, five sons
and four daughters are mostly spoken of. When Mahā-
viṣṇu took the incarnation of Śrī Rāma for a stipulated
purpose, the devas took birth as monkeys in forests, to
help Mahāviṣṇu. Mention is made in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 18, that Nala a very big monkey
was begotten by Viśvakarmā.
<div n="NI"/>The other four sons of Viśvakarmā are mentioned in
Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15. Four sons named
Ajaikapāt, Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra were born
to Viśvakarmā. The great hermit and sage Viśvarūpa
was the son of Tvaṣṭā. Hara, Bahurūpa, Tryambaka,
Aparājita, Vṛṣākapi, Śambhu, Kapardī, Raivata,
Mṛgavyādha, Śarva, and Kapālī are the eleven Rudras.
They are the Īśvaras (gods) of the three worlds. It is
[Page870-a+ 65]
said that in this way there are one hundred Rudras with
shining radiance.
<div n="NI"/>The daughters of Viśvakarmā:—The four prominent
daughters are Saṃjñā, Citrāṅgadā, Surūpā and Bar-
hiṣmatī. The Sun married Saṃjñā. Sun got three
children, Manu, Yama and Yamī by Saṃjñā. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter 2). Priyavrata, the brother
of Uttānapāda, married Surūpā and Barhiṣmatī. Of these
the first wife gave birth to ten sons named Agnīdhra,
Idhmajihva, Yajñabāhu, Mahāvīra, Rukmaśukra,
Ghṛtapṛṣṭha, Savana, Medhātithi, Vītihotra and Kavi
and last of all a daughter named Ūrjjasvatī. Of these
Kavi, Savana and Mahāvīra became abstemious and
well-versed in Brahmavidyā (theosophy). By the other
wife three other sons Uttama, Tāmasa and Raivata were
born to Priyavrata. These grew up to be famous and
gradually became lords of Manvantaras. This Priya-
vrata lived with his sons and ruled over the country
for eleven Arbuda ages (Arbuda = ten crores). In
spite of his old age, his faculties or his body did not
become weak. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>Citrāṅgadā was the fourth daughter of Viśvakarmā.
Ghṛtācī was her mother. The young and beautiful
Citrāṅgadā one day went to bathe in the river in the
Naimiṣa forest. When she got into the water the prince
Suratha, the son of King Sudeva came there. Their eyes
met. Both fell in love with each other. In spite of the
advice of her maids she succumbed to the desire of the
King. Knowing this her angry father Viśvakarmā came
to her and said, “Since you have deviated from the path
of righteousness and abandoned your soul to a libertine,
you will not have marriage, and hence you will not
enjoy the pleasures of having a husband or child.” As
soon as she was cursed, the river Sarasvatī carried the
prince Suratha thirteen yojanas down along with her
current. Because the King was washed away by the
current Citrāṅgadā fell down unconscious. The maids
sprinkled the water from the river Sarasvatī on her face.
Still she lay there as dead. Thinking that she was dead,
her maids went in different ways to fetch firewood and
fire. When the maids were gone, she came to herself
and looked on all sides. Seeing none of her maids in
the vicinity, she felt miserable and jumped into the river
Sarasvatī, and the current carried her down and pushed
her into the great river Gomatī. Being aware of her
future, the great river Gomatī pushed her down and
placed her in a big forest where lions, leopards, tigers
etc. lived in plenty.
<div n="NI"/>A Guhyaka (a section of Yakṣas) who was going
through the sky, saw Citrāṅgadā in the forest, and in
reply to his enquiry she told her story to him. Guhyaka
blessed her and advised her to go to the temple close
by and to worship Śrīkaṇṭheśvara, so that every thing
might end well. Accordingly Citrāṅgadā reached Śrī-
kaṇṭheśvara on the south of Kālindī, bathed in the
Yamunā at noon and went to the temple and bowed
before Śrīkaṇṭha Maheśvara.
<div n="NI"/>At that time the hermit Ṛtadhvaja, well-versed in
Sāmaveda came there to bathe. The hermit called
Citrāṅgadā and enquired about her. She told the hermit
all that had happened to her. Hearing her story, the
hermit became angry and cursed Viśvakarmā. “Let
that Viśvakarmā who has behaved so cruelly towards
his own daughter become a monkey.” Then he called
Citrāṅgadā and said to her. “Good girl, go to the holy
[Page870-b+ 65]
place called Saptagodāvara and worship Hāṭakeśvara
Mahādeva. Devavatī, the daughter of the asura
Kandāramālī the hermit woman Damayantī, the
daughter of Āñjana, a Guhyaka, and Vedavatī the
daughter of Parjanya would come there. At the
time when these three young women meet together
at Hāṭakeśvara, you will unite with your husband.”
Being overjoyed at the words of the hermit, Citrāṅgadā
went to Saptagodāvara, lived there and worshipped Śiva.
Ṛtadhvaja went on his way.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvakarmā, transformed into a huge monkey, was
causing havoc and devastation in the forest. Once the
five-year-old son of Ṛtadhvaja, called Jābāli had gone
to bathe in the river. The Viśvakarmā monkey chased
this boy and caught him and taking him to the top of
a Banyan tree, placed him close to the branches and
tied him fast with creepers. After this the monkey went
to Mahāmeru. As the second adventure, the monkey
separated Damayantī from her father Añjana, a
Guhyaka. Damayantī was born to Añjana by the
celestial maid Pramlocā. Hermit Mudgala had once
prophesied that this Damayantī would become the
prominent wife of a King. The delighted Damayantī
was once about to get into the water of the holy bath
Hiraṇvatī, with her maids when the Viśvakarmā-monkey
ran to the spot and the terrified Damayantī jumped
into the river and was carried down by the current. She
floated down and got into a forest. It was in this forest
that Jābāli was tied to the banyan branches. Damayantī
saw Jābāli. Each said to the other about the cruel deeds
of the monkey. After that according to the advice of
Jābāli, Damayantī went to the temple of Śrīkaṇṭheśvara
on the basin of the river Yamunā. After worshipping
Śrīkaṇṭheśvara, she wrote on the wall of the temple,
a poem about the misfortunes of herself and Jābāli and
stayed in that place engaged in worshipping god.
<div n="NI"/>The next confrontation of the monkey was with Vedavatī
the daughter of Parjanya. Vedavatī was born to
Parjanya by a celestial woman Ghṛtācī. Once while
Vedavatī was playing in the forest, the monkey saw her.
He addressed her Devavatī, intentionally mispronouncing
her name. She replied, “You monkey. I am not
Devavatī, I am Vedavatī.” Instantly the monkey ran to
her. Vedavatī quickly climbed on a hibiscus tree. The
monkey kicked at the tree and broke it. Vedavatī held
fast to a strong branch of the tree. The monkey took
the branch and threw it on to the sea. Every movable
and immovable thing in the world thought a tree was
falling down from the sky. Seeing Vedavatī falling
down, a Gandharva said, “Oh dear, Brahmā himself
had said once that this damsel would become the chief
wife of Indradyumna, the famous hero, the son of Manu
the great King who has completed thousand yāgas
(sacrifices).”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the words of the Gandharva, Indradyumna the
son of Manu, broke that branch into thousand pieces
by his arrows. Though the branch was destroyed, Indra-
dyumna could not find where Vedavatī had fallen. She
floated into a part of the forest. All alone she walked
on and on and reached the temple of Śrīkaṇṭheśvara,
on the bank of Yamunā. Damayantī who had
reached the temple earlier and Vedavatī met each other
and talked about their experiences. Thus due to the
wickedness of the Viśvakarmā-monkey Jābāli the son of
Ṛtadhvaja came to be tied, on to the banyan tree and
[Page871-a+ 65]
Damayantī and Vedavatī to be staying helpless in the
temple of Śrīkaṇtheśvara.
<div n="NI"/>At this time the hermit Gālava reached the temple of
Śrīkaṇṭheśvara. He saw Damayantī and Vedavatī and
felt pity on them. Next day Gālava started for Sapta-
godāvara to take a bath in Kārttika. Damayantī and
Vedavatī followed the hermit. They reached Sapta-
godāvara and dipped in Puṣkara bath. Under water
they saw several Virgin fishes gathered round a whale
begging him for love. The whale was saying harsh
words to them rejecting their request. The fish virgins
again told the whale. “Don't you see the hermit Gālava
going about with two beautiful damsels. If this right-
eous hermit does not fear slander, why should you, who
live under water fear it?” The whale replied. “Gālava
doesn't fear people because he is daring and blind with
love.” Hearing these words of the fishes, Gālava
became ashamed of himself. So without coming up he
stayed under water. The two girls finished bath and
got on the bank, and waited for Gālava. Viśvakarmā's
daughter Citrāṅgadā, who had reached the place
earlier, met the two girls. They told each other their
stories. “As Ṛtadhvaja had prophesied, Damayantī
the daughter of Añjana and Vedavatī the daughter of
Parjanya have arrived.” Thought Citrāṅgadā. “If
Devavatī the daughter of the asura Kandāramālī, also is
come, I could unite with my husband Suratha.” Citrā-
ṅgadā became glad. At this time Devavatī, the daughter
of Kandāramālī, ran to the spot, being chased by the
Viśvakarmā monkey.
<div n="NI"/>The reader might remember that Damayantī had written
a poem on the wall of the temple at Śrīkaṇṭheśvara
when she had gone there at the instruction of Jābāli who
had been tied on to a branch of a tree. At noon on that
day Ṛtadhvaja had gone to the temple at Śrīkaṇṭheś-
vara and happened to see the poem. Then only did he
understand that his son Jābāli had been tied to a tree
by a monkey. By then five hundred years had elapsed.
Ṛtadhvaja was aware of the fact that the only person
capable of liberating Jābāli, was Śakuni the son of Ikṣv-
āku. Ṛtadhvaja reached Ayodhyā instantly and told Ikṣv-
āku. “Oh, mighty King! hear me, please! A monkey
has made my virtuous and learned son Jābāli, a captive
and bound him on a tree, within the boundary of your
kingdom. Nobody in the world except your son Śakuni
will be capable of rescuing him.” Śakuni accompanied
Ṛtadhvaja to the forest. They saw the tall huge banyan
tree with bulky roots hanging on all sides and on the
top of the tree, on a lofty place, the son of Ṛtadhvaja
entangled and entwined by creepers. Seeing the net-
work of creepers around the body of the hermit's son,
Śakuni began to send arrows one after another and cut
off all the creeper's knots. Ṛtadhvaja climbed up the
tree. Seeing his father, Jābāli bowed his head to his
father. Ṛtadhvaja was not capable of extricating his
son. The prince put down his bow and arrow and tried
to untie the knots of the creepers that held his body to
the branch. Though a sturdy man he could not do it.
At last they cut the branch close to his body and got
Jābāli down. A piece of the branch was stuck to his
back. Thus with his son Jābāli bearing a piece of lum-
ber on his back and Śakuni bearing bow and arrows,
Ṛtadhvaja came to Kālindī.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtadhvaja, Śakuni and Jābāli wandered about for years
in search of Damayantī and the others. After nearly a
[Page871-b+ 64]
hundred years, with despair Jābāli bearing the lumber
on his back, went with his father to Kosala. The king
of that country was Indradyumna, the son of Manu. He
welcomed the hermit with hospitality. Ṛtadhvaja talked
about Damayantī. Indradyumna claimed that he had
once saved a young woman by his arrows from the
branch of a tree. They all started in search of the girls.
They reached Badaryāśrama, where they saw a young
hermit. From the conversation it was revealed that the
young hermit was Suratha. When he learned everything
he stopped penance and accompanied them. Under the
leadership of Ṛtadhvaja, they reached Saptagodāvara
and saw Citrāṅgadā.
<div n="NI"/>In the meanwhile Ghṛtācī, sad and miserable, was wan-
dering over the mountain of the rising sun, searching
for her lost daughter Citrāṅgadā. She met the cursed
monkey form of Viśvakarmā and asked it, “Oh! monkey!
have you seen a girl?” The monkey told her every thing
that took place. Ghṛtācī also reached Saptagodāvara.
The monkey followed close behind her. As soon as
Jābāli saw the monkey he got angry and jumped
forward to wreak vengeance. Ṛtadhvaja checked his
son and told him the history of Viśvakarmā. The monkey
separated the piece of the branch from the back of
Jābāli, who had been bearing it on his back for the last
thousand years. Ṛtadhvaja was immensely pleased at
this and asked the monkey what boon he wanted. The
monkey said. “Brahman, if you wish to give me a boon,
please recall your curse. Great hermit! I am Viśvakarmā
the father of Citrāṅgadā. I became a monkey because
of your curse. Let all the sins I have incurred because
of the mischief of a monkey, be remitted.” Hearing
this Ṛtadhvaja said. “Your curse will end when you get
a strong and sturdy son by Ghṛtācī.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Ghṛtācī rose up in the sky. The monkey
also jumped up and followed her. The monkey was
attracted by the beauty of Ghṛtācī. Later, on the
mountain named Kolāhala, the monkey enticed Ghṛtācī
and wooed her. She consented and they lived thus for
a long time. Then they went to the Vindhya mountain.
On the bank of the Godāvarī, a sturdy son was born to
them. This son was the strong sturdy huge monkey Nala,
who helped Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>On the birth of a son Viśvakarmā regained his former
form. He returned to Saptagodāvara with Ghṛtācī.
Gālava also came there. With the hermit Gālava at
the head, the priests made burnt offerings and began the
performance of the marriage ceremony. The Gandharvas
sang and the celestial maids danced. The first marriage
was between Devavatī the daughter of Kandāramālī and
Jābāli. Then Indradyumna married Vedavatī. Next,
Śakuni married Damayantī, the daughter of Añjana,
and lastly Suratha married Citrāṅgadā. (Vāmana
Purāṇa, Chapters 63 and 64).
