VIŚVAKARMĀ¦. The architect of the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Viśvakarmā is the son of Prabhāsa, the
<div n="lb"/>eighth of the Eight Vasus. Varastrī, the sister of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati, a celibate woman who had attained Yoga-
<div n="lb"/>siddhi (union with the Universal Soul) and travelled
<div n="lb"/>all over the world was the wife of Prabhāsa. Prajāpati
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā was born to Prabhāsa by Varastrī. This
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā was the inventor of innumerable kinds of
<div n="lb"/>handicrafts, the architect of the gods, maker of all
<div n="lb"/>kinds of ornaments, and the most famous sculptor. He
<div n="lb"/>was the maker of all the aerial chariots of the Devas.
<div n="lb"/>(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Children.%} Though mention is made about many
<div n="lb"/>children of Viśvakarmā in Various Purāṇas, five sons
<div n="lb"/>and four daughters are mostly spoken of. When Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu took the incarnation of Śrī Rāma for a stipulated
<div n="lb"/>purpose, the devas took birth as monkeys in forests, to
<div n="lb"/>help Mahāviṣṇu. Mention is made in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 18, that Nala a very big monkey
<div n="lb"/>was begotten by Viśvakarmā.
<div n="NI"/>The other four sons of Viśvakarmā are mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15. Four sons named
<div n="lb"/>Ajaikapāt, Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra were born
<div n="lb"/>to Viśvakarmā. The great hermit and sage Viśvarūpa
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Tvaṣṭā. Hara, Bahurūpa, Tryambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Aparājita, Vṛṣākapi, Śambhu, Kapardī, Raivata,
<div n="lb"/>Mṛgavyādha, Śarva, and Kapālī are the eleven Rudras.
<div n="lb"/>They are the Īśvaras (gods) of the three worlds. It is
[Page870-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>said that in this way there are one hundred Rudras with
<div n="lb"/>shining radiance.
<div n="NI"/>The daughters of Viśvakarmā:—The four prominent
<div n="lb"/>daughters are Saṃjñā, Citrāṅgadā, Surūpā and Bar-
<div n="lb"/>hiṣmatī. The Sun married Saṃjñā. Sun got three
<div n="lb"/>children, Manu, Yama and Yamī by Saṃjñā. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter 2). Priyavrata, the brother
<div n="lb"/>of Uttānapāda, married Surūpā and Barhiṣmatī. Of these
<div n="lb"/>the first wife gave birth to ten sons named Agnīdhra,
<div n="lb"/>Idhmajihva, Yajñabāhu, Mahāvīra, Rukmaśukra,
<div n="lb"/>Ghṛtapṛṣṭha, Savana, Medhātithi, Vītihotra and Kavi
<div n="lb"/>and last of all a daughter named Ūrjjasvatī. Of these
<div n="lb"/>Kavi, Savana and Mahāvīra became abstemious and
<div n="lb"/>well-versed in Brahmavidyā (theosophy). By the other
<div n="lb"/>wife three other sons Uttama, Tāmasa and Raivata were
<div n="lb"/>born to Priyavrata. These grew up to be famous and
<div n="lb"/>gradually became lords of Manvantaras. This Priya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata lived with his sons and ruled over the country
<div n="lb"/>for eleven Arbuda ages (Arbuda = ten crores). In
<div n="lb"/>spite of his old age, his faculties or his body did not
<div n="lb"/>become weak. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>Citrāṅgadā was the fourth daughter of Viśvakarmā.
<div n="lb"/>Ghṛtācī was her mother. The young and beautiful
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgadā one day went to bathe in the river in the
<div n="lb"/>Naimiṣa forest. When she got into the water the prince
<div n="lb"/>Suratha, the son of King Sudeva came there. Their eyes
<div n="lb"/>met. Both fell in love with each other. In spite of the
<div n="lb"/>advice of her maids she succumbed to the desire of the
<div n="lb"/>King. Knowing this her angry father Viśvakarmā came
<div n="lb"/>to her and said, “Since you have deviated from the path
<div n="lb"/>of righteousness and abandoned your soul to a libertine,
<div n="lb"/>you will not have marriage, and hence you will not
<div n="lb"/>enjoy the pleasures of having a husband or child.” As
<div n="lb"/>soon as she was cursed, the river Sarasvatī carried the
<div n="lb"/>prince Suratha thirteen yojanas down along with her
<div n="lb"/>current. Because the King was washed away by the
<div n="lb"/>current Citrāṅgadā fell down unconscious. The maids
<div n="lb"/>sprinkled the water from the river Sarasvatī on her face.
<div n="lb"/>Still she lay there as dead. Thinking that she was dead,
<div n="lb"/>her maids went in different ways to fetch firewood and
<div n="lb"/>fire. When the maids were gone, she came to herself
<div n="lb"/>and looked on all sides. Seeing none of her maids in
<div n="lb"/>the vicinity, she felt miserable and jumped into the river
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī, and the current carried her down and pushed
<div n="lb"/>her into the great river Gomatī. Being aware of her
<div n="lb"/>future, the great river Gomatī pushed her down and
<div n="lb"/>placed her in a big forest where lions, leopards, tigers
<div n="lb"/>etc. lived in plenty.
<div n="NI"/>A Guhyaka (a section of Yakṣas) who was going
<div n="lb"/>through the sky, saw Citrāṅgadā in the forest, and in
<div n="lb"/>reply to his enquiry she told her story to him. Guhyaka
<div n="lb"/>blessed her and advised her to go to the temple close
<div n="lb"/>by and to worship Śrīkaṇṭheśvara, so that every thing
<div n="lb"/>might end well. Accordingly Citrāṅgadā reached Śrī-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇṭheśvara on the south of Kālindī, bathed in the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā at noon and went to the temple and bowed
<div n="lb"/>before Śrīkaṇṭha Maheśvara.
<div n="NI"/>At that time the hermit Ṛtadhvaja, well-versed in
<div n="lb"/>Sāmaveda came there to bathe. The hermit called
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgadā and enquired about her. She told the hermit
<div n="lb"/>all that had happened to her. Hearing her story, the
<div n="lb"/>hermit became angry and cursed Viśvakarmā. “Let
<div n="lb"/>that Viśvakarmā who has behaved so cruelly towards
<div n="lb"/>his own daughter become a monkey.” Then he called
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgadā and said to her. “Good girl, go to the holy
[Page870-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>place called Saptagodāvara and worship Hāṭakeśvara
<div n="lb"/>Mahādeva. Devavatī, the daughter of the asura
<div n="lb"/>Kandāramālī the hermit woman Damayantī, the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Āñjana, a Guhyaka, and Vedavatī the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Parjanya would come there. At the
<div n="lb"/>time when these three young women meet together
<div n="lb"/>at Hāṭakeśvara, you will unite with your husband.”
<div n="lb"/>Being overjoyed at the words of the hermit, Citrāṅgadā
<div n="lb"/>went to Saptagodāvara, lived there and worshipped Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtadhvaja went on his way.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvakarmā, transformed into a huge monkey, was
<div n="lb"/>causing havoc and devastation in the forest. Once the
<div n="lb"/>five-year-old son of Ṛtadhvaja, called Jābāli had gone
<div n="lb"/>to bathe in the river. The Viśvakarmā monkey chased
<div n="lb"/>this boy and caught him and taking him to the top of
<div n="lb"/>a Banyan tree, placed him close to the branches and
<div n="lb"/>tied him fast with creepers. After this the monkey went
<div n="lb"/>to Mahāmeru. As the second adventure, the monkey
<div n="lb"/>separated Damayantī from her father Añjana, a
<div n="lb"/>Guhyaka. Damayantī was born to Añjana by the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maid Pramlocā. Hermit Mudgala had once
<div n="lb"/>prophesied that this Damayantī would become the
<div n="lb"/>prominent wife of a King. The delighted Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>was once about to get into the water of the holy bath
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇvatī, with her maids when the Viśvakarmā-monkey
<div n="lb"/>ran to the spot and the terrified Damayantī jumped
<div n="lb"/>into the river and was carried down by the current. She
<div n="lb"/>floated down and got into a forest. It was in this forest
<div n="lb"/>that Jābāli was tied to the banyan branches. Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>saw Jābāli. Each said to the other about the cruel deeds
<div n="lb"/>of the monkey. After that according to the advice of
<div n="lb"/>Jābāli, Damayantī went to the temple of Śrīkaṇṭheśvara
<div n="lb"/>on the basin of the river Yamunā. After worshipping
<div n="lb"/>Śrīkaṇṭheśvara, she wrote on the wall of the temple,
<div n="lb"/>a poem about the misfortunes of herself and Jābāli and
<div n="lb"/>stayed in that place engaged in worshipping god.
<div n="NI"/>The next confrontation of the monkey was with Vedavatī
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Parjanya. Vedavatī was born to
<div n="lb"/>Parjanya by a celestial woman Ghṛtācī. Once while
<div n="lb"/>Vedavatī was playing in the forest, the monkey saw her.
<div n="lb"/>He addressed her Devavatī, intentionally mispronouncing
<div n="lb"/>her name. She replied, “You monkey. I am not
<div n="lb"/>Devavatī, I am Vedavatī.” Instantly the monkey ran to
<div n="lb"/>her. Vedavatī quickly climbed on a hibiscus tree. The
<div n="lb"/>monkey kicked at the tree and broke it. Vedavatī held
<div n="lb"/>fast to a strong branch of the tree. The monkey took
<div n="lb"/>the branch and threw it on to the sea. Every movable
<div n="lb"/>and immovable thing in the world thought a tree was
<div n="lb"/>falling down from the sky. Seeing Vedavatī falling
<div n="lb"/>down, a Gandharva said, “Oh dear, Brahmā himself
<div n="lb"/>had said once that this damsel would become the chief
<div n="lb"/>wife of Indradyumna, the famous hero, the son of Manu
<div n="lb"/>the great King who has completed thousand yāgas
<div n="lb"/>(sacrifices).”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the words of the Gandharva, Indradyumna the
<div n="lb"/>son of Manu, broke that branch into thousand pieces
<div n="lb"/>by his arrows. Though the branch was destroyed, Indra-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna could not find where Vedavatī had fallen. She
<div n="lb"/>floated into a part of the forest. All alone she walked
<div n="lb"/>on and on and reached the temple of Śrīkaṇṭheśvara,
<div n="lb"/>on the bank of Yamunā. Damayantī who had
<div n="lb"/>reached the temple earlier and Vedavatī met each other
<div n="lb"/>and talked about their experiences. Thus due to the
<div n="lb"/>wickedness of the Viśvakarmā-monkey Jābāli the son of
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtadhvaja came to be tied, on to the banyan tree and
[Page871-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Damayantī and Vedavatī to be staying helpless in the
<div n="lb"/>temple of Śrīkaṇtheśvara.
<div n="NI"/>At this time the hermit Gālava reached the temple of
<div n="lb"/>Śrīkaṇṭheśvara. He saw Damayantī and Vedavatī and
<div n="lb"/>felt pity on them. Next day Gālava started for Sapta-
<div n="lb"/>godāvara to take a bath in Kārttika. Damayantī and
<div n="lb"/>Vedavatī followed the hermit. They reached Sapta-
<div n="lb"/>godāvara and dipped in Puṣkara bath. Under water
<div n="lb"/>they saw several Virgin fishes gathered round a whale
<div n="lb"/>begging him for love. The whale was saying harsh
<div n="lb"/>words to them rejecting their request. The fish virgins
<div n="lb"/>again told the whale. “Don't you see the hermit Gālava
<div n="lb"/>going about with two beautiful damsels. If this right-
<div n="lb"/>eous hermit does not fear slander, why should you, who
<div n="lb"/>live under water fear it?” The whale replied. “Gālava
<div n="lb"/>doesn't fear people because he is daring and blind with
<div n="lb"/>love.” Hearing these words of the fishes, Gālava
<div n="lb"/>became ashamed of himself. So without coming up he
<div n="lb"/>stayed under water. The two girls finished bath and
<div n="lb"/>got on the bank, and waited for Gālava. Viśvakarmā's
<div n="lb"/>daughter Citrāṅgadā, who had reached the place
<div n="lb"/>earlier, met the two girls. They told each other their
<div n="lb"/>stories. “As Ṛtadhvaja had prophesied, Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of Añjana and Vedavatī the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Parjanya have arrived.” Thought Citrāṅgadā. “If
<div n="lb"/>Devavatī the daughter of the asura Kandāramālī, also is
<div n="lb"/>come, I could unite with my husband Suratha.” Citrā-
<div n="lb"/>ṅgadā became glad. At this time Devavatī, the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Kandāramālī, ran to the spot, being chased by the
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā monkey.
<div n="NI"/>The reader might remember that Damayantī had written
<div n="lb"/>a poem on the wall of the temple at Śrīkaṇṭheśvara
<div n="lb"/>when she had gone there at the instruction of Jābāli who
<div n="lb"/>had been tied on to a branch of a tree. At noon on that
<div n="lb"/>day Ṛtadhvaja had gone to the temple at Śrīkaṇṭheś-
<div n="lb"/>vara and happened to see the poem. Then only did he
<div n="lb"/>understand that his son Jābāli had been tied to a tree
<div n="lb"/>by a monkey. By then five hundred years had elapsed.
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtadhvaja was aware of the fact that the only person
<div n="lb"/>capable of liberating Jābāli, was Śakuni the son of Ikṣv-
<div n="lb"/>āku. Ṛtadhvaja reached Ayodhyā instantly and told Ikṣv-
<div n="lb"/>āku. “Oh, mighty King! hear me, please! A monkey
<div n="lb"/>has made my virtuous and learned son Jābāli, a captive
<div n="lb"/>and bound him on a tree, within the boundary of your
<div n="lb"/>kingdom. Nobody in the world except your son Śakuni
<div n="lb"/>will be capable of rescuing him.” Śakuni accompanied
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtadhvaja to the forest. They saw the tall huge banyan
<div n="lb"/>tree with bulky roots hanging on all sides and on the
<div n="lb"/>top of the tree, on a lofty place, the son of Ṛtadhvaja
<div n="lb"/>entangled and entwined by creepers. Seeing the net-
<div n="lb"/>work of creepers around the body of the hermit's son,
<div n="lb"/>Śakuni began to send arrows one after another and cut
<div n="lb"/>off all the creeper's knots. Ṛtadhvaja climbed up the
<div n="lb"/>tree. Seeing his father, Jābāli bowed his head to his
<div n="lb"/>father. Ṛtadhvaja was not capable of extricating his
<div n="lb"/>son. The prince put down his bow and arrow and tried
<div n="lb"/>to untie the knots of the creepers that held his body to
<div n="lb"/>the branch. Though a sturdy man he could not do it.
<div n="lb"/>At last they cut the branch close to his body and got
<div n="lb"/>Jābāli down. A piece of the branch was stuck to his
<div n="lb"/>back. Thus with his son Jābāli bearing a piece of lum-
<div n="lb"/>ber on his back and Śakuni bearing bow and arrows,
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtadhvaja came to Kālindī.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtadhvaja, Śakuni and Jābāli wandered about for years
<div n="lb"/>in search of Damayantī and the others. After nearly a
[Page871-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>hundred years, with despair Jābāli bearing the lumber
<div n="lb"/>on his back, went with his father to Kosala. The king
<div n="lb"/>of that country was Indradyumna, the son of Manu. He
<div n="lb"/>welcomed the hermit with hospitality. Ṛtadhvaja talked
<div n="lb"/>about Damayantī. Indradyumna claimed that he had
<div n="lb"/>once saved a young woman by his arrows from the
<div n="lb"/>branch of a tree. They all started in search of the girls.
<div n="lb"/>They reached Badaryāśrama, where they saw a young
<div n="lb"/>hermit. From the conversation it was revealed that the
<div n="lb"/>young hermit was Suratha. When he learned everything
<div n="lb"/>he stopped penance and accompanied them. Under the
<div n="lb"/>leadership of Ṛtadhvaja, they reached Saptagodāvara
<div n="lb"/>and saw Citrāṅgadā.
<div n="NI"/>In the meanwhile Ghṛtācī, sad and miserable, was wan-
<div n="lb"/>dering over the mountain of the rising sun, searching
<div n="lb"/>for her lost daughter Citrāṅgadā. She met the cursed
<div n="lb"/>monkey form of Viśvakarmā and asked it, “Oh! monkey!
<div n="lb"/>have you seen a girl?” The monkey told her every thing
<div n="lb"/>that took place. Ghṛtācī also reached Saptagodāvara.
<div n="lb"/>The monkey followed close behind her. As soon as
<div n="lb"/>Jābāli saw the monkey he got angry and jumped
<div n="lb"/>forward to wreak vengeance. Ṛtadhvaja checked his
<div n="lb"/>son and told him the history of Viśvakarmā. The monkey
<div n="lb"/>separated the piece of the branch from the back of
<div n="lb"/>Jābāli, who had been bearing it on his back for the last
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. Ṛtadhvaja was immensely pleased at
<div n="lb"/>this and asked the monkey what boon he wanted. The
<div n="lb"/>monkey said. “Brahman, if you wish to give me a boon,
<div n="lb"/>please recall your curse. Great hermit! I am Viśvakarmā
<div n="lb"/>the father of Citrāṅgadā. I became a monkey because
<div n="lb"/>of your curse. Let all the sins I have incurred because
<div n="lb"/>of the mischief of a monkey, be remitted.” Hearing
<div n="lb"/>this Ṛtadhvaja said. “Your curse will end when you get
<div n="lb"/>a strong and sturdy son by Ghṛtācī.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Ghṛtācī rose up in the sky. The monkey
<div n="lb"/>also jumped up and followed her. The monkey was
<div n="lb"/>attracted by the beauty of Ghṛtācī. Later, on the
<div n="lb"/>mountain named Kolāhala, the monkey enticed Ghṛtācī
<div n="lb"/>and wooed her. She consented and they lived thus for
<div n="lb"/>a long time. Then they went to the Vindhya mountain.
<div n="lb"/>On the bank of the Godāvarī, a sturdy son was born to
<div n="lb"/>them. This son was the strong sturdy huge monkey Nala,
<div n="lb"/>who helped Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>On the birth of a son Viśvakarmā regained his former
<div n="lb"/>form. He returned to Saptagodāvara with Ghṛtācī.
<div n="lb"/>Gālava also came there. With the hermit Gālava at
<div n="lb"/>the head, the priests made burnt offerings and began the
<div n="lb"/>performance of the marriage ceremony. The Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>sang and the celestial maids danced. The first marriage
<div n="lb"/>was between Devavatī the daughter of Kandāramālī and
<div n="lb"/>Jābāli. Then Indradyumna married Vedavatī. Next,
<div n="lb"/>Śakuni married Damayantī, the daughter of Añjana,
<div n="lb"/>and lastly Suratha married Citrāṅgadā. (Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapters 63 and 64).
