DHARMASVA¦. A Brahmin. Once this Brahmin was
coming home with water from the Gaṇges. On the way
he saw Kāpakalpa, the servant of merchant Ratnākara,
being killed by an ox. Though Kāpakalpa was a sinner,
his end aroused pity in the heart of the Brahmin. So he
sprinkled the Ganges-water on the body of Kāpakalpa,
who instantly regained life and energy. The Brahmin
who saw the power of Ganges-water began to worship
the Ganges from that day onwards. It is mentioned in
Padma Purāṇa, Kriyā Khaṇḍa, Chapter 7, that finally
the Brahmin got a boon from the Ganges that only
uttering the name of the Ganges should he meet with
death.
