<div n="lb"/>custom in vogue in ancient India. It was not prohibit-
<div n="lb"/>ed for a man to have more than one wife. It was
<div n="lb"/>customary to give dowry also. It is said in the Ṛgveda,
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala 10, Anuvāka 3, Sūkta 11 that the bride should
<div n="lb"/>proceed to the house of the husband, after the marriage.
<div n="lb"/>A spell (mantra) meant for keeping down one's co-wife,
<div n="lb"/>is seen in the Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 10, Anuvāka 11, Sūkta
<div n="lb"/>17. It is a prayer to destroy the love of husband for a
<div n="lb"/>co-wife and to direct that love towards oneself. The
<div n="lb"/>deity of this spell is Indrāṇī the wife of Indra who was
<div n="lb"/>a polygamist. In those days marriage was an essential
<div n="lb"/>duty. Widow marriage was not forbidden.
