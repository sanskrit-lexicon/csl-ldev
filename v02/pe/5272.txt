PRAHLĀDA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Son of a rākṣasa King who
<div n="lb"/>saw Mahāviṣṇu by means of his devotion in the form
<div n="lb"/>of Narasiṃha (man-lion). His father was Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu and mother Kayādhū.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Hiraṇyakaśipu—
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapaprajāpati got of his wife Diti two
<div n="lb"/>sons named Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu and a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Siṃhikā. Of these two, Hiraṇyākṣa got
<div n="lb"/>boons from Brahmā and roamed about as a very valiant
<div n="lb"/>hero destroying everything on earth and finally pulling
<div n="lb"/>down the earth to the depths of the ocean. Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>then incarnated as Varāha and after killing Hiraṇyā-
<div n="lb"/>kṣa lifted the earth from the ocean and put it in its
<div n="lb"/>original position.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu became very angry at Mahāviṣṇu for
<div n="lb"/>killing his brother and with a view to wreaking
<div n="lb"/>vengeance on him performed penance to propitiate
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. When the emperor of the demons, Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu, thus went to the forests for performing penance
<div n="lb"/>the Devas attacked the land of the demons. A great
<div n="lb"/>fight ensued in which the devas were defeated. While
<div n="lb"/>fleeing away thus Indra took away Kayādhū wife of
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu by force. Nārada who heard the
<div n="lb"/>moanings of the poor woman under the clutches of
<div n="lb"/>Indra got her released from Indra's hold. For some
<div n="lb"/>time she stayed in the āśrama of Nārada worshipping
<div n="lb"/>him. Kayādhū was pregnant then. Nārada taught the
<div n="lb"/>child in Kayādhū's womb lessons in Vedas, moral
<div n="lb"/>philosophy, duty and spiritual knowledge. When
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu returned after his penance Kayādhū
<div n="lb"/>joined him and very soon gave birth to a son. That boy
<div n="lb"/>was Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu begot of Kayādhū five sons, Prahlāda,
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhlāda, Anuhlāda, Śibi and Bāṣkala. Prahlāda got
<div n="lb"/>three sons named Virocana, Kumbha and Nikumbha.
<div n="lb"/>The celebrated emperor Mahābali was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Virocana. Bāṇa was the son of Mahābali. Uṣā,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Bāṇa, was married to Aniruddha, son of
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna and grandson of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (Chapter 65,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva; Chapter 19, Agni Purāṇa; Chapter 15,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa and 7th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boyhood and education.%} Hiraṇyakaśipu decided to
<div n="lb"/>make Prahlāda an instrument to wreak vengeance on
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. Entrusting the education of his son to
[Page596-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>able preceptors he instructed that the boy should never
<div n="lb"/>mutter ‘Nārāyaṇāya namaḥ’ but should on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand mutter ‘Hiraṇyāya namaḥ’ only. Not only that,
<div n="lb"/>he wiped out the name of Nārāyaṇa from the land
<div n="lb"/>altogether. Prahlāda stayed in the house of the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor and studied his lessons. One day Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>went to see his father along with his preceptor. Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu was drunk then. Prahlāda went and prostrated
<div n="lb"/>before his father and Hiraṇyakaśipu lifting the boy up
<div n="lb"/>from the ground asked him with affection to repeat to
<div n="lb"/>him all the good things he had learned so far and
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda quickly repeated thus:—“I bow down to
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu, the root cause of all things seen and unseen,
<div n="lb"/>the protector of this visible universe, who is without
<div n="lb"/>beginning, centre and end and who is without origin,
<div n="lb"/>growth and decay.”
<div n="NI"/>The words of Prahlāda struck his father like a thunder-
<div n="lb"/>bolt. With his lips trembling with anger Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>stared with his blood-red eyes at the preceptor. The
<div n="lb"/>frightened Guru again and again submitted that he had
<div n="lb"/>never taught him any of the kind the boy had repeated
<div n="lb"/>before his father. Then who must have taught him those
<div n="lb"/>things? the emperor enquired. Then Prahlāda said
<div n="lb"/>that all those things were put into his mind by Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu himself. A hot discussion then took place between
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda and his father and in the end Hiraṇyakaśīpu
<div n="lb"/>ordered the preceptor to take away Prahlāda and make
<div n="lb"/>another earnest attempt to correct him and bring him
<div n="lb"/>round to the emperor's liking. Prahlāda stayed for ano-
<div n="lb"/>ther period with the Guru serving him with devotion
<div n="lb"/>and studying well. After a long time Prahlāda was
<div n="lb"/>again taken before his father and the latter as before
<div n="lb"/>asked him to repeat what he had studied so far. To the
<div n="lb"/>shocking disappointment of Hiraṇyakaśipu Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>again repeated verses in praise of Mahāviṣṇu. The emp-
<div n="lb"/>eror's rage knew no bounds and he ordered his men to
<div n="lb"/>kill his son. (Chapter 17, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Torturing Prahlāda.%} On hearing the order of Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu many armed soldiers surrounded Prahlāda.
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda addressed them thus: “Oh daityas, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu resides in your weapons, in you all and in me also.
<div n="lb"/>Since that is the real truth your weapons will not in-
<div n="lb"/>jure me.” The daityas struck him hard with their wea-
<div n="lb"/>pons but Prahlāda did not feel pain at all.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu then sent thousands of poisonous ser-
<div n="lb"/>pents led by great ones like Takṣaka. When they started
<div n="lb"/>thrusting their venomous fangs into his body, Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>stood cheerfully meditating on Mahāviṣṇu and he did
<div n="lb"/>not even feel the bitings. On the other hand the fangs
<div n="lb"/>of the serpents dropped out from their mouths and the
<div n="lb"/>gems on the heads of the big ones burst out and all the
<div n="lb"/>snakes felt sorry for their action.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu then sent the aṣṭadiggajas (the eight
<div n="lb"/>elephants who bear the burden of this earth) to kill
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda. The huge animals bigger than the biggest of
<div n="lb"/>mountains threw the boy to the ground and struck him
<div n="lb"/>with their long and pointed tusks. Prahlāda lay medi-
<div n="lb"/>tating on Mahāviṣṇu and the tusks that hit the body of
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda were broken to bits. Prahlāda was then
<div n="lb"/>thrown into a pit of fire. But the wind-blown ferocious
<div n="lb"/>fire was not able to burn him and as he lay in the fire-
<div n="lb"/>pit meditating on Mahāviṣṇu he felt he was lying on a
<div n="lb"/>bed of lotuses.
<div n="NI"/>When things progressed so far the astonished priests of
<div n="lb"/>the palace advised the emperor to put a stop to tortur-
[Page596-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ing Prahlāda. Their consoling words alleviated his rage
<div n="lb"/>and he sent Prahlāda again to his Guru for another
<div n="lb"/>term of study. He stayed with his Guru and continued
<div n="lb"/>his studies. Whenever he got leisure he taught the other
<div n="lb"/>inmates of the āśrama lessons in Viṣṇumārga. Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu was informed of this and obeying orders from him
<div n="lb"/>the asuras gave poison to Prahlāda. That too was of no
<div n="lb"/>avail. The royal priests got angry and they created a
<div n="lb"/>devil as ferocious as the flames of fire. The devil with
<div n="lb"/>mighty thumpings on earth dashed towards Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>and hit him on his breast with its spike. The spike
<div n="lb"/>broke into pieces and the devil turning back cursed the
<div n="lb"/>priests. Then the daityarāja took him to the top of a
<div n="lb"/>mountain twentyfour miles high and pushed him down
<div n="lb"/>from there. The boy fell down meditating on Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu and the goddess of earth received him with ex-
<div n="lb"/>tended hands and prevented a painful impact with the
<div n="lb"/>ground. The father became furious and sent Śambarā-
<div n="lb"/>sura to kill his son. Śambara tried many magical attacks.
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda without any ill-feeling towards Śambara
<div n="lb"/>sat meditating on Mahāviṣṇu and then Viṣṇu sent his
<div n="lb"/>Sudarśana wheel against the demon and he was forced
<div n="lb"/>to retreat. Then by orders from Hiraṇyakaśipu the wind
<div n="lb"/>god entered the body of Prahlāda. Prahlāda knew it
<div n="lb"/>and he sat meditating on Viṣṇu and the latter entering
<div n="lb"/>the body of Prahlāda drank the wind inside him. When
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu was defeated in all his attempts to kill
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda he sent his son again to his Guru. Then the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor taught him everything that was needed for a
<div n="lb"/>king and also the science of justice written by Śukrā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya. When Prahlāda completed his education and the
<div n="lb"/>Guru felt the boy had become humble he took him back
<div n="lb"/>to Hiraṇyakaśipu.
<div n="NI"/>Once again Hiraṇyakaśipu entered into a discussion on
<div n="lb"/>god with his son and dissatisfied with his continued de-
<div n="lb"/>votion to Viṣṇu decided again to kill his son. He was
<div n="lb"/>thrown into the ocean bound hand and foot. With every
<div n="lb"/>movement of Prahlāda the ocean became turbulent
<div n="lb"/>and water rose on all sides. There was a deluge on
<div n="lb"/>earth. Hiraṇyakaśipu called the daityas to his side and
<div n="lb"/>said: “Oh daityas, bring all the mountains on earth
<div n="lb"/>and create a barrier round the ocean so that my wicked
<div n="lb"/>son cannot get outside the ocean. Fire does not kill
<div n="lb"/>this boy; he is not wounded by any of the weapons;
<div n="lb"/>wind, poison, devils, magic, falls from heights and even
<div n="lb"/>the diggajas could not kill him. So let him remain in
<div n="lb"/>water for thousands of years together and then he
<div n="lb"/>will die.”
<div n="NI"/>The daityas and dānavas brought mountains and drop-
<div n="lb"/>ped them over Prahlāda lying inside the ocean. The
<div n="lb"/>mountains lay spread over thousands of miles. Lying
<div n="lb"/>thus in the ocean the pious boy prayed to Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and the latter appeared before him and granted him
<div n="lb"/>boons. Escaping from the ocean Prahlāda went to his
<div n="lb"/>father and prostrated before him. Hiraṇyakaśipu was
<div n="lb"/>astounded to see him alive and taking him in his arms
<div n="lb"/>embraced him and with tears rolling down his cheeks
<div n="lb"/>for having tortured him so far asked him “My son, you
<div n="lb"/>are still alive, are you not?” After that he started treat-
<div n="lb"/>ing him as his son. (Chapter 20, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The incarnation of Narasiṃha.%} But as days went by
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu got wild again. He could not bear his
<div n="lb"/>son's increasing devotion to Viṣṇu. He hated to hear
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda's chantings of Viṣṇu's name and so one dar
[Page597-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>while Prahlāda was repeating his chantings of Viṣṇu's
<div n="lb"/>name Hiraṇyakaśipu jumped up from his seat with
<div n="lb"/>sword in his hand and asked Prahlāda where his Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was. Prahlāda very calmly replied that Viṣṇu was pre-
<div n="lb"/>sent everywhere even in stones, trees or the pillars of
<div n="lb"/>the palace. Hiraṇyakaśipu in uncontrollable rage struck
<div n="lb"/>the nearest pillar with his sword. Then to the shock-
<div n="lb"/>ing surprise of Hiraṇyakaśipu Mahāviṣṇu in the form of
<div n="lb"/>a fierce man-lion (Narasiṃha) jumped out from the
<div n="lb"/>pillar. The figure was terrifying to look at. It had fiery
<div n="lb"/>eyes, a dagger-like tongue with blood oozing from it,
<div n="lb"/>shaggy neck with trembling eyebrows, two teeth one
<div n="lb"/>on each side curved like the crescent moon, a black face
<div n="lb"/>inside a cave-like heap of manes, hairs strong and point-
<div n="lb"/>ed like diamond needles, nails white and cup-like and
<div n="lb"/>a body as bright and brilliant as a thousand crores of
<div n="lb"/>suns. Only Prahlāda could stand before the figure and
<div n="lb"/>look at it.
<div n="NI"/>The man-lion jumped on the body of Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>and tearing open the belly of Hiraṇyakaśipu took the
<div n="lb"/>bloody intestines out and wearing it round its neck
<div n="lb"/>performed a naked dance. Everything happened in no
<div n="lb"/>time and the Narasiṃha changing into the form of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu blessed Prahlāda and then disappeared.
<div n="lb"/>(7th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Prahlāda and Naranārāyaṇas.%} When Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>was killed Prahlāda was crowned as emperor of the
<div n="lb"/>demons in Pātāla. At that time, once Cyavana the best of
<div n="lb"/>the Bhṛgus, went to Nāgakuleśvaratīrtha to bathe in the
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā. He saw Mahādeva there. When he entered
<div n="lb"/>the waters of the river a serpent Kekaralohita by name
<div n="lb"/>bit him and took him to Pātāla. Cyavana meditated on
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu when he was bitten by the serpent and so he was
<div n="lb"/>not affected by the poison of the serpent. He therefore,
<div n="lb"/>roamed about in Pātāla accepting the hospitality of the
<div n="lb"/>serpent maidens. Travelling thus he reached the land
<div n="lb"/>of the dānavas. He was worshipped by the daityas there
<div n="lb"/>and Prahlāda finding an ascetic of great saintliness hon-
<div n="lb"/>oured and worshipped by his people received him with
<div n="lb"/>respect and worshipped him and enquired about him.
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana said: “I came today to see Nāgakuleśvara
<div n="lb"/>and bathe in the Narmadā river. But as soon as I en-
<div n="lb"/>tered the river I was caught by a serpent and was
<div n="lb"/>brought to Pātāla. I was thus able to see you.” Hearing
<div n="lb"/>the words of Cyavana the lord of the daityas said: “Oh,
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavan, which are all the sacred tīrthas of the earth,
<div n="lb"/>which are in the heavens and which all in Pātāla?
<div n="lb"/>Please do enlighten us.” Cyavana replied; “Mighty
<div n="lb"/>king, Naimiṣa is the best of all tīrthas on earth, Puṣkara
<div n="lb"/>in the heavens and Cakratīrtha in Pātāla.”
<div n="NI"/>The daitya emperor turned to the dānavas and said
<div n="lb"/>“Make all preparations immediately. We must go to
<div n="lb"/>earth to bathe in the holy tīrtha, Naimiṣa. We can then
<div n="lb"/>see Puṇḍarīkākṣa (lotus-eyed) Viṣṇu sitting there as
<div n="lb"/>Pītāmbara (robed in yellow).” Hearing this dānavas
<div n="lb"/>with heavy equipments started from Pātāla with their
<div n="lb"/>king to the earth.
<div n="NI"/>All the mighty dānavas reached the forest of Naimiṣa
<div n="lb"/>and after bathing in the holy pond there went for hunt-
<div n="lb"/>ing. During their wanderings they found the river Sar-
<div n="lb"/>asvatī, flowing with crystal-like water. On the shore of
<div n="lb"/>the same they saw a pine tree covered with arrows. The
<div n="lb"/>arrows were sticking to it one above another. The arr-
<div n="lb"/>ows looked like serpents and the gruesome sight roused
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda's anger. Near that tree sat two ascetics wear-
[Page597-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ing the hide of Kṛṣṇa deer and matted hair on their
<div n="lb"/>heads. By their side were two divine bows, Śārṅga and
<div n="lb"/>Ajagava with two never-empty quivers. Prahlāda mis-
<div n="lb"/>took them for two fake sannyāsins and therefore question-
<div n="lb"/>ed them thus: “Why are you thus falsely trading on
<div n="lb"/>virtuousness? What connection is there between matted
<div n="lb"/>hair and penance and weapons of such supreme qual-
<div n="lb"/>ity?” Then one of the ṛṣis, Nararṣi, said “King of dait-
<div n="lb"/>yas, why do you think like that? If one is powerful
<div n="lb"/>whatever one does will be right.” Prahlāda jeered and said
<div n="lb"/>“When I, who have fixed limits for virtue and righte-
<div n="lb"/>ousness, am here what power can you wield?” Nara
<div n="lb"/>replied “Oh king, our ability is really supreme. There
<div n="lb"/>is nobody in the three worlds to conquer us in a fight.”
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda got furious on hearing the boasting of the ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>and took a vow thus immediately: “I will fight and
<div n="lb"/>win against Naranārāyaṇas.” Then the great Prah-
<div n="lb"/>lāda keeping aside his army in the forest took his bow
<div n="lb"/>and made a thundering noise with it.
<div n="NI"/>At once Nara took his Ajagava bow and showered arr-
<div n="lb"/>ows on Prahlāda with it. But Prahlāda broke them all
<div n="lb"/>with his gold-plated matchless arrows. Nara got angry
<div n="lb"/>when he found all his arrows broken to pieces so easily
<div n="lb"/>by Prahlāda and he sent different kinds of arrows in
<div n="lb"/>quick succession. But the daitya king replied with aston-
<div n="lb"/>ishing rapidity. For one arrow of Nara the daitya sent
<div n="lb"/>two and the fight became grim. Nara covered the whole
<div n="lb"/>world above with arrows and the daitya emperor smash-
<div n="lb"/>ed them all to pieces by his gold-plated ones.
<div n="NI"/>The fight then turned to one with divine weapons. The
<div n="lb"/>asura chief took the divine Brahmāstra and then Nara
<div n="lb"/>took the fierce Nārāyaṇāstra. They met in the air and
<div n="lb"/>fell down powerless. When his Brahmāstra got fused
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda got wild with anger and taking a mace jump-
<div n="lb"/>ed out of his chariot and rushed at Nara. When Nārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa saw the daitya chief rushing towards Nara with
<div n="lb"/>his mace he asked Nara to step aside and faced the
<div n="lb"/>demon himself. Prahlāda then attacked Nārāyaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>hit him with the mace. But the mace broke into a hun-
<div n="lb"/>dred pieces and Prahlāda was forced to use other wea-
<div n="lb"/>pons. The fight became ghastly and even devas assem-
<div n="lb"/>bled above to witness the fight. When Prahlāda found
<div n="lb"/>it was getting more and more difficult for him to defeat
<div n="lb"/>the Naranārāyaṇas he prayed to Mahāviṣṇu for help.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu appeared before him and when Prahlāda asked
<div n="lb"/>him the reason why he could not defeat Naranārāyaṇas,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu replied that they were the sons of Dharmadeva
<div n="lb"/>who were invincible by weapons. They could be won
<div n="lb"/>over only by devotion.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that Prahlāda returned to Pātāla and entrust-
<div n="lb"/>ing the administration of his kingdom to his cousin
<div n="lb"/>Andhaka, son of Hiraṇyākṣa, Prahlāda returned to
<div n="lb"/>Badarikāśrama and erecting an āśrama there started a
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Naranārāyaṇas. When Nara-
<div n="lb"/>nārāyaṇas appeared before him Prahlāda requested to
<div n="lb"/>be pardoned for fighting against them. They pardoned
<div n="lb"/>him and blessed him and Prahlāda returned to Pātāla.
<div n="lb"/>Even after his return Prahlāda did not take back the
<div n="lb"/>administration from Andhaka. He constructed an
<div n="lb"/>āśrama away from the palace and lived there performing
<div n="lb"/>penance. He spent many years there as an advisor
<div n="lb"/>to the asura Kings. (Chapters 7 and 8, Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Blessings of Śukra.%} Andhaka, son of Hiraṇyākṣa,
<div n="lb"/>ruled over the empire only for a short time. At that time
[Page598-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>there was a fight between the asuras and the devas in
<div n="lb"/>which the asuras were defeated. After a truce with the
<div n="lb"/>devas Bali, son of Virocana, and grandson of Prahlāda
<div n="lb"/>was crowned the emperor of the asuras. Prahlāda then
<div n="lb"/>went to the mountain Gandhamādana and started doing
<div n="lb"/>penance to increase his personal power. Bali ruled as
<div n="lb"/>an antagonist of the devas and so very soon a grisly
<div n="lb"/>battle ensued between the devas and the asuras
<div n="lb"/>and Mahāviṣṇu defeated them. They fled from their
<div n="lb"/>land and took refuge under their preceptor Śukrācārya.
<div n="lb"/>Śukra then told them thus: “You remain here without
<div n="lb"/>fear. I shall protect you by my power of mantra and
<div n="lb"/>medicines. I shall devote my cogent brilliance to your
<div n="lb"/>advantage. It is enough if you remain here with full con-
<div n="lb"/>fidence in me.”
<div n="NI"/>The devas understood all these plans of the daityas
<div n="lb"/>through spies and they met in conference to consider
<div n="lb"/>their future plans. They knew that Śukrācārya was very
<div n="lb"/>powerful and if the daityas attacked them with the
<div n="lb"/>help of Śukrācārya the defeat of the devas was sure.
<div n="lb"/>They feared that they might even be compelled to flee
<div n="lb"/>from Svargaloka. How could the daityas under the
<div n="lb"/>shield of the mighty Sukra be destroyed? That was the
<div n="lb"/>worrying thought of the devas.
<div n="NI"/>They were thus worrying about this when Śukrācārya
<div n="lb"/>went to do penance for attaining more power. The
<div n="lb"/>daityas awaited the return of their ācārya. In the mean-
<div n="lb"/>time they sent Prahlāda who was, though a daitya, a
<div n="lb"/>friend of the devas to talk peace terms with the devas.
<div n="lb"/>The mission was successful and the devas agreed to a
<div n="lb"/>no-war treaty. Prahlāda returned triumphant.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra did severe penance to propitiate Śiva and Śiva
<div n="lb"/>appeared before Śukrācārya and when he knew that
<div n="lb"/>the purpose of Śukra was to defeat the devas he was
<div n="lb"/>a bit embarrassed. So he told him thus: “Oh sage
<div n="lb"/>Śukra, you take a vow and do penance with your head
<div n="lb"/>downwards over smoky incense for a thousand years.
<div n="lb"/>You will then attain power and happiness as you
<div n="lb"/>desire.” In fact Śiva thought Śukra might not be able
<div n="lb"/>to complete the penance and so not succeed in his plan
<div n="lb"/>of destroying the devas. But Śukra started the penance
<div n="lb"/>in right earnest.
<div n="NI"/>The devas were frightened when they knew the deceit
<div n="lb"/>of the daityas and the strategy of their preceptor. They
<div n="lb"/>decided to go to war with the daityas immediately. The
<div n="lb"/>daityas were in a fix. They knew that if they fought
<div n="lb"/>without the help of their guru defeat to them was sure.
<div n="lb"/>So they ran to the mother of Śukra and sought her help.
<div n="lb"/>The devas rebelled against Śukra's mother and she in-
<div n="lb"/>voked the goddess of sleep and put all the devas into
<div n="lb"/>deep slumber. Mahāviṣṇu stealthily carried away Indra
<div n="lb"/>lying asleep. Indra persuaded Mahāviṣṇu. to kill Śukra's
<div n="lb"/>mother and he cut off the head of Śukra's mother by
<div n="lb"/>the divine discus, Sudarśana.
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgumaharṣi, father of Śukra, was angry at that
<div n="lb"/>arrogant and cruel deed of Mahāviṣṇu and cursed him
<div n="lb"/>saying that he would be born on earth several times as
<div n="lb"/>man. After that he brought to life by sprinkling water
<div n="lb"/>his wife lying dead with her head severed from her body.
<div n="lb"/>Knowing well the havoc that would be created
<div n="lb"/>when Śukra came back after his penance Indra
<div n="lb"/>sent his daughter Jayantī to destroy the penance of
<div n="lb"/>Śukra. She went in the guise of a demon girl to serve
<div n="lb"/>Śukrācārya. In the meantime at the request of Indra
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati took the form of Śukrācārya and presented
[Page598-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>himself before the daityas. The daityas believed him to
<div n="lb"/>be their real guru Śukra and were pleased.
<div n="NI"/>Ten years went by and one day Śukrācārya remember-
<div n="lb"/>ing the old events left Jayantī and went to his court
<div n="lb"/>in the demon land. Bṛhaspati had by that time returned
<div n="lb"/>to devaloka fully satisfied with his mission. The devas
<div n="lb"/>not knowing that Śukra had returned started for a war
<div n="lb"/>with the daityas. Śukra when he came back went wild
<div n="lb"/>when he knew that his people had been worshipping
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati for ten years. The angered preceptor was not
<div n="lb"/>to be pacified by any amount of arguments and so they
<div n="lb"/>sent Prahlāda to Śukrācārya and Prahlāda pleaded for
<div n="lb"/>controlling his anger and Śukra did so.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra then saw with his divine vision the maneuverings
<div n="lb"/>in mind of the devas and was convinced that a war with
<div n="lb"/>the devas at that juncture would be an utter failure. So
<div n="lb"/>he advised the daityas to desist from war and assured
<div n="lb"/>them that during the period of Sāvarṇi Manu to come,
<div n="lb"/>emperor Bali would become all-powerful and he would
<div n="lb"/>then fight and win the devas. Prahlāda returned and
<div n="lb"/>told the asuras the message of Śukrācārya. But the
<div n="lb"/>daityas were not satisfied and compelled Prahlāda to go
<div n="lb"/>to war with the devas. At last Prahlāda was forced
<div n="lb"/>to agree and a fierce devāsura battle ensued. Prah-
<div n="lb"/>lāda met Indra in a single combat and it prolonged for
<div n="lb"/>a hundred years. In the end Prahlāda won. Indra
<div n="lb"/>prayed to the goddess and fearing that she might des-
<div n="lb"/>troy the demon world, Prahlāda also prayed to her.
<div n="lb"/>The devī was pleased with both of them and she paci-
<div n="lb"/>fied them both and each went back to his own place.
