IḌĀ I¦. Daughter of Vāyu (wind-god). Iḍā had a son
Utkala by Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>IḌĀ II. Daughter of Manu. In Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
we find the following reference to this Iḍā:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Manu came to know that Devas and Asuras had
performed an Agnyādhāna (consecration of the fire).
To ascertain whether it was deposited at the proper
time, Manu sent Iḍā to them. Iḍā found that both
parties had followed the wrong method, She said to
Manu:—“Your yajña (Agnyādhāna) should not be as
ineffectual as that of the Devas and Asuras. Therefore
I myself shall deposit the Trividhāgnis (the three Agnis
which are to be set in the proper place) at the proper
place.” Manu agreed and began his yāga. As a result
of it the Devas attained plenty and prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Iḍā was in the presence of Manu. the
Devas invited her openly and the Asuras invited her
covertly. Since Iḍā accepted the invitation of the
Devas, all creatures abandoned the Asuras and joined
the party of Devas. (Taittirīya Saṃhitā).
