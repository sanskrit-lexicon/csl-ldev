doing rigorous penance. One day desirous of conduct-
ing a special type of Yajña he went to bathe in the

river along with other sages. There he saw the celes-
tial beauty, Ghṛtācī, standing in all splendour after her
bath. Bharadvāja had seminal emission and from that
was born a daughter, Śrutavatī, to him. (Chapter 47,
