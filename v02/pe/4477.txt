MĀYĀSĪTĀ¦. When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were in exile
in the forests with Sītā, Rāvaṇa came to carry away
Sītā. At that time the real Sītā disappeared in Agni
and in her place a false Sītā was installed. It was this
phantom Sītā who was carried away by Rāvaṇa and
who lived in Laṅkā till the time of Rāvaṇa's death. It
was this Māyāsītā whom Rāma asked to jump into the
fire to test her purity. At that time Māyāsītā disap-
peared and the real Sītā came out from the fire. (See
under SĪTĀ).
