NAVAVYŪHĀRCANA¦. This is a worship conducted to
<div n="lb"/>prevent epidemics. In olden days Mahāviṣṇu advised
<div n="lb"/>Nārada on the form of this worship. The form of this
<div n="lb"/>worship is given below:
<div n="NI"/>In the centre of the circular lotus, consecrate Vāsudeva
<div n="lb"/>with the first syllable of mantra (spell) ‘A’. To the
<div n="lb"/>south of him consecrate and worship Saṅkarṣaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna with the syllable ‘Ā’; in the S.E. corner,
<div n="lb"/>Aniruddha with the syllable ‘Aḥ’; in the west, Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>with the syllable ‘Om’; Brahmā in the N.W. corner
<div n="lb"/>with the syllables ‘Tatsat’; Viṣṇu in the North with the
<div n="lb"/>syllable ‘Hum’; Nṛsiṃha with the syllable ‘Kṣau’
<div n="lb"/>and Varāha in the N.E. corner with the syllable
<div n="lb"/>‘bhūm’.
<div n="NI"/>Consecrate Garuḍa with spells having as first syllables
<div n="lb"/>‘Kam’, ‘ṭam’, “sam” and ‘śam’ at the western entrance of
<div n="lb"/>the lotus figure; Pūrvavaktra, with syllables ‘Kham’
<div n="lb"/>‘cham’, Vam’ and hum’ at the southern entrance of the lotus
<div n="lb"/>figure; Gadā (club), with the syllables ‘Kham’, ‘ṭham’
<div n="lb"/>and ‘Śam’ at the Northern entrance; consecrate Īśa
<div n="lb"/>with the syllables ‘bam’, ‘ṇam’, ‘mam’ and ‘Kṣam, in the
<div n="lb"/>North East corner. Then consecrate Śrī with the
<div n="lb"/>syllables ‘Dham’, ‘Dam’, ‘Bham’ and ‘Ham’ on the
<div n="lb"/>southern side; Vanamālī with the syllables ‘Gam’, ‘Ḍam’
<div n="lb"/>‘Vam’ and ‘Śam’, on the northern side; Śrīvatsa with
<div n="lb"/>the syllables ‘sam’, ‘ham’ and ‘lam’, to the west of
<div n="lb"/>Vanamālī; and Kaustubha, with the syllables, ‘cham’,
<div n="lb"/>‘Tam’ and ‘yam’, to the west of Śrīvatsa.
<div n="NI"/>After having consecrated and worshipped persons as
<div n="lb"/>mentioned above, in the order of the ten member-parts
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu, Ananta should be consecrated below
<div n="lb"/>the seat of the deity and in the order of the ten member
<div n="lb"/>parts of Ananta, the four component parts called Mahe-
<div n="lb"/>ndra and so on should be consecrated on the four direct-
<div n="lb"/>ions such as east and so on, and consecrate in the same
<div n="lb"/>way all the decorations, flags, canopy etc. Then the
<div n="lb"/>three spheres of Vāyu (Air), Agni (fire) and Indu
<div n="lb"/>(moon) should be consecrated with the first syllables
<div n="lb"/>of the spells suited to each and meditating on them
<div n="lb"/>and worshipping them, dip the body in the meditation.
<div n="lb"/>Then imagine that the subtle form of the individual soul
<div n="lb"/>is staying in the sky. Then meditate that the individual
<div n="lb"/>soul is reborn by harmony with the universal soul after
<div n="lb"/>having been dipped and washed in the snow-
<div n="lb"/>white ambrosia emanating from the moon. After
<div n="lb"/>that saying to yourself ‘I am Viṣṇu himself
<div n="lb"/>reborn”, utter the twelve-syllabled mantra or spell.
<div n="lb"/>Place heart, head, turban and weapon respectively on
<div n="lb"/>chest, head, hind part of the lock of hair and Netra (eye).
<div n="lb"/>Place weapons in both hands. After this your body will
<div n="lb"/>become divine. This placing of the individual soul
<div n="lb"/>should be repeated in the same way with Deva (god)
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva. When this worship of Viṣṇu is conducted in
[Page537-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>heart in imagination (without the aid of materials) it
<div n="lb"/>is called ‘Anirmālyapūjā, and when it is done with the
<div n="lb"/>aid of lotus figure etc., it is called Sanirmālya pūjā.
<div n="NI"/>At this pūjā (worship) the disciple should stand with
<div n="lb"/>eyes tied. Then on whichever deity he places flower it
<div n="lb"/>should be given that name. Place it on the left side
<div n="lb"/>and burn gingelly, paddy and ghee in the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>fire. After performing hundred and eight burnings
<div n="lb"/>perform another burning for the purification of the
<div n="lb"/>body. To each of the member-parts of the Navavyūha
<div n="lb"/>deities also burnt offering should be made, no less than
<div n="lb"/>hundred times to each. Then put the entire thing in
<div n="lb"/>fire as burnt offering. Then the disciples should take
<div n="lb"/>fast, and the disciples should offer wealth etc. to the
<div n="lb"/>teacher. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 201).
