KA¦.ĀDA. A famous sage of ancient India. He was the
founder of the Vaiśeṣika system. The word means one
who eats Kaṇa (atom). His foes gave him this name to
ridicule him. He is also called Kaṇabhakṣaka. Kaṇāda
is known as Pippalāda also. (He got that name because
he used to eat Pippalī (long pepper) in large quanti-
ties). (See under PIPPALĀDA).
