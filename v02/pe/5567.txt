PUṢPAVĀHANA¦. A King of Rathantarakalpa. He
<div n="lb"/>got ten thousand sons of his wife Lāvaṇyavatī. Puṣpa-
<div n="lb"/>vāhana was a hunter in his previous birth. He used to
<div n="lb"/>give daily lotus flowers to a harlot who was doing
<div n="lb"/>worship of Viṣṇu observing the Dvādaśīvrata. He was
<div n="lb"/>doing this service with such devotion that in the next
<div n="lb"/>birth he was born under the name Puṣpavāhana
<div n="lb"/>(carrier of flowers). The sage Bhṛgu once told him
<div n="lb"/>about his previous birth and asked him to observe
<div n="lb"/>dvādaśīvrata. Puṣpavāhana observed the vrata and
<div n="lb"/>attained bliss. (Sṛṣṭi khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
