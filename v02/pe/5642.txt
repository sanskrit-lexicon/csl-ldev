RAKTABĪJA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Rebirth of Rambhāsura, father of Mahi-
ṣāsura. Stories of Raktabīja and Rambhāsura are
inextricably intertwined.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of Raktabīja.%} Once upon a time there lived an
asura king called Danu. His two sons, Rambha and
Karambha who had no children, did tapas at Pañcanada
for the blessing of having issues. Rambha and Karambha
meditated upon Mālavaṭa Yakṣa, the former seated at
the centre of the five fires and the latter standing in the
water. Indra in the guise of a crocodile dragged
Karambha away by the feet and killed him. Angry at
the death of his brother, Rambha decided to cut off his
head and offer it in fire. When he was about to do so,
Agni appeared and told him that suicide was worse
than killing others, and promised to grant him what-
ever he desired. Accordingly Rambha requested Agni
for a son more effulgent than the latter, who would
conquer the three worlds and would not be defeated
even by the Devas and the Asuras. Rambha further
wanted that son to be as powerful as Vāyu, exceptionally
handsome and skilled in archery.
<div n="NI"/>Agni blessed Rambha that he would have, as desired, a
son by the woman whom he coveted. On his way
back home he saw a beautiful she-buffalo, which he
married. He took the buffalo which got pregnant by
him, to Pātāla to protect it from the attack by
other buffaloes. One day another buffalo felt a passion
for Rambha's wife and in the fight that ensued Rambha
was killed by it. Rambha's wife died in his funeral
pyre. It was from the centre of the fire that the very
powerful Mahiṣāsura was born. Rambhāsura also rose
from the fire under the name Raktabīja. (Vāmana
Purāṇa, Chapter 17; Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Boon to Raktabīja.%} Raktabīja secured from Śiva a
boon according to which if one drop of blood from
his body fell on the battlefield, many Raktabījas would
arise from the blood and fight the enemies. Each of
these Raktabījas would also be like the others in the
matter of strength, form and weapons. (Devī Bhāga-
vata, 5th Skandha).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%His death.%} War between Devas and Asuras broke out
and in the fight between Devī and Raktabīja blood from
his body flowed. When Devī found it impossible to
kill the lakhs of Raktāsuras who arose from the blood,
she resorted to a trick. She asked Cāmuṇḍī to lick off
the blood flowing from Raktabīja before it fell on the
ground. Accordingly Devī began killing the asuras and
Cāmuṇḍī consuming their blood and flesh. When the
artificial Raktabījas were all killed thus, the original
Raktabīja alone remained and in the fight between
them, Devī cut off his head with her sword. Cāmuṇḍī
did not permit even a drop of blood to fall on the
ground. (Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha).
