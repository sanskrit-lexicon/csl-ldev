JANTU¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A King of the Pūru dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 278, that he
<div n="lb"/>was the son of the King Somaka and father of the King
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣatanu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jantu born again.%} Somaka had hundred wives. But
<div n="lb"/>only one of them gave birth to a child. That child was
<div n="lb"/>Jantu. He was a pet of all the hundred wives. Once
<div n="lb"/>Jantu was bitten by an ant. All the hundred queens
<div n="lb"/>began crying and shouting and all ran to him. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>the tumult in the women's apartment of the palace,
<div n="lb"/>the King and the minister ran to that place. When
<div n="lb"/>the tumult was over the King began to think. “It is
<div n="lb"/>better to have no sons at all, than to have only one
<div n="lb"/>son. There are hundred queens. But none of them
<div n="lb"/>bears a child. Is there a solution for this?”
<div n="NI"/>At last the King summoned his family-priests and
<div n="lb"/>consulted them. The decision of the priests was that
<div n="lb"/>if the King should sacrifice his only son, then all his
<div n="lb"/>wives would become pregnant and all would give
<div n="lb"/>birth to children, and that among the sons thus born,
<div n="lb"/>Jantu also would be reborn. The mother of Jantu did
<div n="lb"/>not look at this project with favour. “How can we be
<div n="lb"/>sure that Jantu also will be there among the sons to be
<div n="lb"/>born, after his death?” She was worried by this
<div n="lb"/>thought. The priests consoled her and said that there
<div n="lb"/>will be a golden mole on the left flank of Jantu.
<div n="lb"/>Finally the mother agreed to their plan. Sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>dais was arranged. Sacrificial fire for holy offerings was
<div n="lb"/>prepared. The priests tore the child into pieces and
<div n="lb"/>offered them as oblation in the fire. When the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>was finished, all the hundred queens became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>Each of them gave birth to a child. As the priests had
<div n="lb"/>predicted, there was a golden mole on the left flank
<div n="lb"/>of the child delivered by the mother of Jantu. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapters 127 and 128).
