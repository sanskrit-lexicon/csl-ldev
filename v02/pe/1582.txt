CITRĀṄGADĀ II¦. A wife of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>{%General information.%} When once Dharmaputra was
closeted with Pāñcālī in amorous talks Arjuna by mis-
take entered the room and was thus compelled as per
a previous mutual agreement to go on a pilgrimage for a
year. During this exile he married the serpent girl
Ulūpī. After that he proceeded again on his pilgrimage
and reached a state called Maṇalūr. Maṇalūr was then
reigned by a King called Citravāhana. Citrāṅgadā
was the daughter of Citravāhana.
<div n="NI"/>An ancestor of Citravāhana greatly grieved by the lack
of a son, did great penance to propitiate Śiva and Śiva
blessed him and said that in future he and his successors
[Page185-b+ 65]
would get a son to keep their line unbroken. Accordingly
all the forefathers of Citravāhana got a son each but
when it came to the turn of the latter he got a girl
instead.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna accidentally saw Citrāṅgadā and fell in love with
her, and knowing that, the king received Arjuna in his
palace and requested Arjuna to marry his daughter.
Arjuna married her and the couple got a son named
Babhruvāhana. Promising them that he would come
back and take them to Hastināpura Arjuna continued
his pilgrimage. (Chapters 219, 220, and 221, Ādi
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Citrāṅgadā came to Hastināpura.%} When after the
great epic battle Dharmaputra conducted an Aśva-
medhayajña it was Arjuna who led the sacrificial horse
to the south. When Arjuna came to Maṇalūr he came
against Babhruvāhana who challenged him for a fight.
In the grim battle that ensued Arjuna fell dead by the
piercing arrows of Babhruvāhana, his own son. At that
time Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā came to the scene and
seeing Arjuna lying dead, Ulūpī brought the diamond,
Mṛtasañjīvanī, and placing it on Arjuna's face brought
him back to life. (See Babhruvāhana for details).
After this incident all of them, Citrāṅgadā, Ulūpī and
Babhruvāhana went to Hastināpura along with Arjuna.
(Chapters 79 to 81, Aśvamedha Parva).
