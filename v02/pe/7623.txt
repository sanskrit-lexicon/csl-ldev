TUHUṆḌA¦. A demon. This demon was born to
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa of his wife Danu. (Chapter 65, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Accompanied by Tārakāsura this demon once attacked
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya. Tuhuṇḍa threw an iron mace against
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati who blocked his chariot. By a single stone of
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati, the diamond-studded mace of the demon
<div n="lb"/>broke into six pieces. When he found his mace gone
<div n="lb"/>the demon caught hold of Gaṇapati and beat him with
<div n="lb"/>a spiked club on his forehead. Gaṇapati cut him with
<div n="lb"/>his weapon (Axe) ‘Veṇmazhu’. The demon fell to the
<div n="lb"/>ground in two pieces but still his hold on Gaṇapati
<div n="lb"/>was not released. Gaṇapati tried his best but could not
<div n="lb"/>loosen the hold. Then Kuṇḍodara, a leader of the
<div n="lb"/>attendants of Gaṇapati smashed the hands of Tuhuṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>with an iron mace. Tuhuṇḍa was killed thus. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>65, Vāyu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>This Tuhuṇḍa was born in his next life in the world as
<div n="lb"/>a King called Senābindu. (Śloka 19, Chapter 67, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
