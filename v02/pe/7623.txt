TUHUṆḌA¦. A demon. This demon was born to
Kaśyapa of his wife Danu. (Chapter 65, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Accompanied by Tārakāsura this demon once attacked
Subrahmaṇya. Tuhuṇḍa threw an iron mace against
Gaṇapati who blocked his chariot. By a single stone of
Gaṇapati, the diamond-studded mace of the demon
broke into six pieces. When he found his mace gone
the demon caught hold of Gaṇapati and beat him with
a spiked club on his forehead. Gaṇapati cut him with
his weapon (Axe) ‘Veṇmazhu’. The demon fell to the
ground in two pieces but still his hold on Gaṇapati
was not released. Gaṇapati tried his best but could not
loosen the hold. Then Kuṇḍodara, a leader of the
attendants of Gaṇapati smashed the hands of Tuhuṇḍa
with an iron mace. Tuhuṇḍa was killed thus. (Chapter
65, Vāyu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>This Tuhuṇḍa was born in his next life in the world as
a King called Senābindu. (Śloka 19, Chapter 67, Ādi
Parva).
