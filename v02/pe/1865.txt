DEVASENĀ¦. Dakṣa's daughter and wife of Subrah-
maṇya and a woman of rare beauty and purity. Dait-
yasenā and Devasenā, daughters of Dakṣa, used to
enjoy themselves at Mānasa saras. One day Keśī, the
asura saw them and craved for their love. Daityasenā
agreed to become his wife, but Devasenā refused, and
she prayed for the help of Indra, who happened to
come there at the moment. Indra and Keśī fought
with each other. Keśī used the club against Indra, who
broke it into two with his vajrāyudha. Then Keśī hurled
a mountain at Indra, who cut it also. Frightened to
death Keśī then ran away with Daityasenā to safety,
and Devasenā expressed her desire to Indra to have
one who could defeat the Devas, Dānavas and Yakṣas
as her husband. But, Indra could not find such a one
in the whole universe. Indra told Brahmā about it.
The Devas put their heads together and brought forth
Subrahmaṇya from Śiva to be her husband. In the
war between the Devas and the asuras Devasenā helped
Subrahmaṇya, and the asuras were completely destro-
yed. (Vana Parva, Chapters 223, 224).
