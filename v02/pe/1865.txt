DEVASENĀ¦. Dakṣa's daughter and wife of Subrah-
<div n="lb"/>maṇya and a woman of rare beauty and purity. Dait-
<div n="lb"/>yasenā and Devasenā, daughters of Dakṣa, used to
<div n="lb"/>enjoy themselves at Mānasa saras. One day Keśī, the
<div n="lb"/>asura saw them and craved for their love. Daityasenā
<div n="lb"/>agreed to become his wife, but Devasenā refused, and
<div n="lb"/>she prayed for the help of Indra, who happened to
<div n="lb"/>come there at the moment. Indra and Keśī fought
<div n="lb"/>with each other. Keśī used the club against Indra, who
<div n="lb"/>broke it into two with his vajrāyudha. Then Keśī hurled
<div n="lb"/>a mountain at Indra, who cut it also. Frightened to
<div n="lb"/>death Keśī then ran away with Daityasenā to safety,
<div n="lb"/>and Devasenā expressed her desire to Indra to have
<div n="lb"/>one who could defeat the Devas, Dānavas and Yakṣas
<div n="lb"/>as her husband. But, Indra could not find such a one
<div n="lb"/>in the whole universe. Indra told Brahmā about it.
<div n="lb"/>The Devas put their heads together and brought forth
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya from Śiva to be her husband. In the
<div n="lb"/>war between the Devas and the asuras Devasenā helped
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya, and the asuras were completely destro-
<div n="lb"/>yed. (Vana Parva, Chapters 223, 224).
