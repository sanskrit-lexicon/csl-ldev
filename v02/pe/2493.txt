GOVARDHANA¦. A mountain of Ambāḍi (Gokula).
This is believed to be a form of Kṛṣṇa. This is called
Girirāja also. The residents of Ambāḍi from time imme-
morial used to worship Indra for getting rains. But
after the advent of Kṛṣṇa there came a change in that
belief. Kṛṣṇa told them that rains depended on Govar-
dhana and it was enough if they worshipped that moun-
tain and so the residents of Ambāḍi started worshipping
the mountain. Indra got enraged at this and sent heavy
rains to Ambāḍī intending to submerge it in water. But
Śrī Kṛṣṇa lifted the mountain over Ambāḍi like an um-
brella and saved the city from the wrath of
Indra. See under ‘Kṛṣṇa’ for more details. (Daśama
Skandha, Bhāgavata)
