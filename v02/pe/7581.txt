TRIJAṬA¦ (GĀRGYA). A sage. Though he was a sage
he lived by farming. He had a wife and children and
his earnings from farm work were insufficient to make
both ends meet. They were living in poverty and it
[Page792-b+ 65]
was at that time that Rāma started for his life in exile
in the forests. Before he commenced his journey to
the forests he gave immense wealth to all the Brahmins
who had assembled around him. At that time Trijaṭa
never knew about it and when it came to the ears of
Trijaṭa's wife she ran to the fields and persuaded
Trijaṭa to go and see Śrī Rāma. When Trijaṭa came to
the scene, Rāma had almost finished his distribution,
but Trijaṭa took courage and pushing forward through
the crowd approached Rāma and said “Oh, famous
King, I am a poor man with many children. Give
something for this poor man who lives by farming.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this, Śrī Rāma giving him a small stick asked
him to throw the stick into the midst of the cattle
grazing nearby. The Brahmin tightening his clothes
and getting ready threw the stick with all his might
to the south. The stick fell beyond a lakh of cattle
grazing there. Śrī Rāma gave him all the cattle which
stood inside the area covered by the stick. (Chapter
32, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Trijaṭa was the son of Viśvāmitra. (Śloka 55, Chapter
4, Anuśāsana Parva).
