GUṆĀḌHYA¦. He is the author of the celebrated Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>kathā which is a precious mine of Sanskrit Literature.
<div n="lb"/>Guṇāḍhya had written this in satanic (paiśācika) lan-
<div n="lb"/>guage difficult for ordinary people to read or understand.
<div n="lb"/>This was translated into Sanskrit by the poet Kṣemen-
<div n="lb"/>dra in a book called Bṛhatkathāmañjarī. This was the
<div n="lb"/>first translation and it was in an abridged form. Soma-
<div n="lb"/>deva made a more elaborate translation and it is this
<div n="lb"/>translation that is now known as the Kathāsaritsāgara.
<div n="NI"/>Guṇāḍhya is believed to be an incarnation of the Śiva-
<div n="lb"/>pārṣada, Mālyavān. There is a story behind Mālyavān
<div n="lb"/>being cursed and made to be born as man by Pārvatī.
<div n="lb"/>Once Pārvatī worried Śiva to tell her a story original
<div n="lb"/>and interesting and not heard of by anybody before.
<div n="lb"/>Placing Nandikeśa at the door and instructing him not
<div n="lb"/>to allow anybody inside Śiva started narrating the story
<div n="lb"/>of the Vidyādharas to Pārvatī. At that time Puṣpadanta,
<div n="lb"/>chief of the genie-guards of Śiva who was at liberty
<div n="lb"/>to go to the presence of Śiva at any time, came there
<div n="lb"/>and heedless of the protests of Nandikeśa entered the
<div n="lb"/>room. There he found Śiva telling a story to Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>and she was hearing the same with rapt attention. The
<div n="lb"/>story was so interesting that Puṣpadanta also heard it
<div n="lb"/>standing concealed in a place in the room. After having
<div n="lb"/>heard the whole story Puṣpadanta went back unnoticed
[Page302-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and told the story to his wife, Jayā. Jayā on another
<div n="lb"/>occasion told the story to Pārvatī and the latter was
<div n="lb"/>taken aback and she went to Śiva and complained:
<div n="lb"/>“Your Lordship told me that the story was unique,
<div n="lb"/>not heard of before by anybody. But even Jayā knows
<div n="lb"/>it.” And she wept with disappointment. Then Śiva
<div n="lb"/>stood in meditation for sometime, and knew how
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpadanta had entered the room unnoticed and how
<div n="lb"/>he had told the story he had heard to Jayā. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>explained this to Pārvatī and she immediately sent
<div n="lb"/>word for Puṣpadanta who came trembling and confess-
<div n="lb"/>ed everything. Pārvatī then cursed Puṣpadanta
<div n="lb"/>and also Mālyavān who came to speak on behalf of
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpadanta and made them men. They begged for
<div n="lb"/>relief from the curse and then she said, “Long ago
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśravaṇa cursed a Yakṣa named Supratīka and con-
<div n="lb"/>verted him into a devil named Kāṇabhūti. This devil
<div n="lb"/>is now living in the deep forests on the Vindhya moun-
<div n="lb"/>tains. When you talk with him you will become your
<div n="lb"/>old selves again. Puṣpadanta should first tell the story
<div n="lb"/>he has heard from Śiva to Kāṇabhūti and then he will
<div n="lb"/>be relieved from the curse. Kāṇabhūti will then tell
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān many stories. Then Kāṇabhūti will get
<div n="lb"/>release from the curse. Mālyavān should make public
<div n="lb"/>all the stories he had heard from Kāṇabhūti and then
<div n="lb"/>he will also get release from the curse.” Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpadanta was born as Vararuci in the city of Kau-
<div n="lb"/>śāṃbī and Mālyavān as Guṇāḍhya in the city of
<div n="lb"/>Supratiṣṭhita. (For details see under Vararuci).
<div n="NI"/>The story of how Supratīka became Kāṇabhūti is this:
<div n="lb"/>The Yakṣa, Supratīka, got friendly with a demon
<div n="lb"/>named Śūlaśiras and they moved about freely as chums.
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśravaṇa did not like this and he cursed Supratīka
<div n="lb"/>and converted him into a satan. At once, Dīrghajaṅgha,
<div n="lb"/>elder brother of Supratīka, came and begged for relief.
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśravaṇa then said: “Puṣpadanta will be born on
<div n="lb"/>the earth by a curse as man and he will one day come
<div n="lb"/>and tell Supratīka many great stories. After hearing
<div n="lb"/>them he should narrate them to Mālyavān who will
<div n="lb"/>then be born on the earth as man. Supratīka will then
<div n="lb"/>get release from the curse and become his old self again”.
<div n="lb"/>Supratīka was born in the forests of Vindhya as
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇabhūti.
<div n="NI"/>This is the story of the birth of Guṇāḍhya. There is a
<div n="lb"/>city called Supratiṣṭhita in the country of Pratiṣṭhāna
<div n="lb"/>and there lived a brahmin named Somaśarmā. He had
<div n="lb"/>two sons, Vatsa and Gulmaka and a daughter named
<div n="lb"/>Śrutārthā. Before long the parents died and Śrutārthā
<div n="lb"/>grew up under the protection of her brothers. Kīrtisena,
<div n="lb"/>brother of Vāsuki, married her by gāndharva rites and
<div n="lb"/>Guṇāḍhya was the child born to them.
<div n="NI"/>Even while he was a boy he went to the south for his
<div n="lb"/>education and there from a brahmin he studied all arts
<div n="lb"/>and sciences. When he completed his studies he started
<div n="lb"/>on a tour and at that time became the minister of a
<div n="lb"/>king called Sātavāhana. He married from there. One
<div n="lb"/>day his (Sātavāhana's) wife rebuked the king when the
<div n="lb"/>latter made some linguistic errors and Sātavāhana be-
<div n="lb"/>came dejected and moody from that day onwards. Then
<div n="lb"/>there came to the court of the King a brahmin named
<div n="lb"/>Śarvavarman who promised to make the King proficient
<div n="lb"/>in languages within six months. But Guṇāḍhya said that
<div n="lb"/>it was not possible to do so within six months. They made
<div n="lb"/>a bet. Guṇāḍhya swore that if Śarvavarman would teach
<div n="lb"/>the King the Śabdasāstra (science of language-sounds)
[Page302-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>within six months he (Guṇāḍhya) would abandon his
<div n="lb"/>knowledge of Sanskrit, Prakrit and local language. On the
<div n="lb"/>other hand if Śarvavarmā failed to accomplish the feat
<div n="lb"/>the latter should wear on his head for twelve years the
<div n="lb"/>chappals of Guṇāḍhya. Śarvavarman agreed and went
<div n="lb"/>to do penance to please Subrahmaṇya. Subrahmaṇya
<div n="lb"/>granted him a boon by the power of which Śarvavar-
<div n="lb"/>man made Sātavāhana a scholar in Sanskrit. Defeated,
<div n="lb"/>Guṇāḍhya abandoned his knowledge of all languages
<div n="lb"/>and bidding adieu to the King by gestures left for the
<div n="lb"/>Vindhyan forests.
<div n="NI"/>When Guṇāḍhya went to the forests Kāṇabhūti, King
<div n="lb"/>of the satans was not in his place. He heard the
<div n="lb"/>satans speaking in their peculiar language and intelli-
<div n="lb"/>gent that he was he picked up the language,
<div n="lb"/>and when Kāṇabhūti came he spoke to him in his own
<div n="lb"/>language. Kāṇabhūti told in the satanic language the
<div n="lb"/>great stories of seven Vidyādharas. Guṇāḍhya took
<div n="lb"/>seven years to write the stories in the satanic language
<div n="lb"/>and compile them into seven lakhs of granthas to form
<div n="lb"/>a Mahākāvya. There were no writing materials availa-
<div n="lb"/>ble for him and Guṇāḍhya wrote them all on leaves
<div n="lb"/>using blood and twigs. When he started reading his
<div n="lb"/>book all the devas assembled in the sky to hear it. On
<div n="lb"/>hearing it Kāṇabhūti got release from the curse. It is
<div n="lb"/>this book containing seven lakhs of granthas that is
<div n="lb"/>called the Bṛhatkathā.
<div n="NI"/>Guṇāḍhya then thought of how to keep alive such an
<div n="lb"/>interesting and gigantic book and then two of his
<div n="lb"/>companions Guṇadeva and Nandideva suggested to
<div n="lb"/>him to dedicate the book to the King, Sātavāhana.
<div n="lb"/>Guṇāḍhya agreed to that and the two disciples took the
<div n="lb"/>book to the King. The King read the whole story. But
<div n="lb"/>did not like it. It was very elaborate. The language
<div n="lb"/>was satanic. It was written with blood. The King
<div n="lb"/>looked at the book with contempt.
<div n="NI"/>When the disciples found that the King was not in
<div n="lb"/>favour of the work, they took it back to Guṇādhya.
<div n="lb"/>Guṇāḍhya felt a great dejection. He went to a hillock
<div n="lb"/>nearby with his disciples and made a big fire-pit. He set
<div n="lb"/>aside the story of the Vidyādhara named Naravāhana-
<div n="lb"/>datta composed of a lakh of granthas for the use of
<div n="lb"/>his disciples and then started putting into the fire-pit
<div n="lb"/>the rest, reading aloud each leaf before he put it into
<div n="lb"/>the fire. The sad disciples watched it weeping. Even
<div n="lb"/>the wild animals of the forest flocked to the place and
<div n="lb"/>stood there listening to Guṇāḍhya. At that time Sāta-
<div n="lb"/>vāhana became a sick man. The physicians of the
<div n="lb"/>palace said that the illness was caused by the dry flesh
<div n="lb"/>he was taking. The cook was called in and he accus-
<div n="lb"/>ed the hunters who supplied them with flesh
<div n="lb"/>daily. The hunters were questioned and they informed
<div n="lb"/>the King that only such flesh was available since all
<div n="lb"/>the beasts and birds were standing without food listen-
<div n="lb"/>ing to a man who was reading something from a leaf
<div n="lb"/>and then burning it in a fire-pit before him. Sātavā-
<div n="lb"/>hana immediately went to the place guided by the
<div n="lb"/>hunters. There to his astonishment he found Guṇāḍhya
<div n="lb"/>sitting before a fire-pit surrounded by weeping beasts
<div n="lb"/>and birds and throwing leaves of his book one by one
<div n="lb"/>into the fire after reading each before it was put into
<div n="lb"/>the fire. Sātavāhana ran to him and prostrated before
<div n="lb"/>him. Guṇāḍhya then told Sātavāhana his story in
<div n="lb"/>satanic language beginning from the curse on Puṣpa-
<div n="lb"/>danta down to his destroying his own work in the fire.
[Page303-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>His disciples translated his talk to the King. The King
<div n="lb"/>was awe-strickeṅ and he asked for the granthas. But
<div n="lb"/>by that time he had already burnt six lakhs of gran-
<div n="lb"/>thas containing six stories. He gave to the King the
<div n="lb"/>remaining one lakh of granthas. After that, bidding
<div n="lb"/>farewell to the King, Guṇāḍhya jumped into the fire
<div n="lb"/>and abandoned his life on earth and went to the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>King Sātavāhana accompanied by the disciples of
<div n="lb"/>Guṅāḍhya came to his palace carrying the ‘Bṛhatkathā’
<div n="lb"/>containing the story of Naravāhanadatta. He gave
<div n="lb"/>presents to Guṇadeva and Nandideva who explained
<div n="lb"/>to him the book in Sanskrit. King Sātavāhana added
<div n="lb"/>a preface to the book to explain to the public how the
<div n="lb"/>book came to be written in satanic language. The book
<div n="lb"/>very soon got world fame. (Pīṭhānulaṃbaka Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>sarit sāgara).
