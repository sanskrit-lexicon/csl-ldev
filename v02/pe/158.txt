AKŪPĀRA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} There is a lake in the Himā-
layas called Indradyumna. Akūpāra is a tortoise living
in it. There is also a statement that this is the Ādi-
Kūrma (second of the ten incarnations of God). A
description of Akūpāra is found in Chapter 199 of Vana
Parva in Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Cirañjīvī (One who has no death).%} When the Pāṇḍa-
vas were in exile in the forests sage Mārkaṇḍeya tells
many stories to Dharmaputra to console him in his sad
plight. The Pāṇḍavas asked Mārkaṇḍeya whether he
knew of anybody living before him. Then the sage said,
“In times of old Indradyumna an ascetic King (Rājarṣi)
fell down from heaven when he fell short of his accumu-
lated ‘Puṇya’. Sorrowfully he came to me and asked me
whether I knew him. I replied in the negative adding
that perhaps Prāvīrakarṇa an owl living on the top of
the Himālayas might know him since he was older
than me. At once Indradyumna became a horse and
taking me on its back approached the owl living in the
Himālayas. The owl also could not remember Indra-
dyumna but directed him to a stork named Nāḍījaṃgha
who was older than the owl. The Ascetic king took me
then to the Indradyumna lake where the stork lived.
The stork also could not find the identity of Indra-
dyumna. Perhaps he said that a tortoise of name Akū-
pāra living in that same lake might know him. We then
approached the tortoise and enquired whether he knew
Indradyumna. The tortoise sat in meditation for some
time and then weeping profusely and shaking like a leaf
stood bowing respectfully and said, “How can I remain
without knowing him? There are several monuments
of the useful work done by him here. This very lake is of
his making. This came into existence by the march of
the cows he gave away to the people”. The moment
[Page024-a+ 64]
the tortoise finished speaking a chariot appeared from
heaven to take the King away. The King after leaving
me and the owl in their proper places ascended to heaven
in the chariot.
