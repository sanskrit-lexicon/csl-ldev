MAṄKAṆA¦ (MAṄKANA). A barber of Vārāṇasī
<div n="lb"/>who was a great devotee of Gaṇeśa. During the time of
<div n="lb"/>King Divodāsa II Śiva wanted to destroy the city of
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī and deputed his son Gaṇeśa (Nikumbha) for the
<div n="lb"/>same.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇeśa came to Kāśī and appearing in person before
<div n="lb"/>his devotee Maṅkaṇa, asked him to build a temple on
<div n="lb"/>the outskirts of Kāśī. Maṅkaṇa completed the temple
<div n="lb"/>and Gaṇeśa (Nikumbha) installed himself in that
<div n="lb"/>temple getting for it the name Nikumbhamandira.
<div n="lb"/>Devotees began to flow into the temple and Nikumbha
<div n="lb"/>sitting there answered the prayers of all. But he never
<div n="lb"/>fulfilled the prayer of the King to have a son. This
<div n="lb"/>annoyed Divodāsa and he destroyed the temple and
<div n="lb"/>then Nikumbha cursed that the city of Kāśī would
<div n="lb"/>become desolate. Śiva's desire thus became fulfilled.
