SUDAKṢIṆA¦ 1. The son of king Pauṇḍraka. Śrī-
Kṛṣṇa killed Pauṇḍraka in battle and his head, cut
off by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, fell in the country of Kāśī. Sudak-
ṣiṇa who learned about the death of his father, went
to Kāśī and recognized the head by the ear-rings. Sud-
akṣiṇa made up his mind to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa somehow
or other and began to do penance in Kāśī before
Śiva. Pleased with his penance Śiva appeared before
him and advised him to create a wicked fairy from
the fire of sorcery. Accordingly Sudakṣiṇa prepared a
fire of sorcery, from which a wicked fairy came out and
ran towards Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa sent his weapon the
Discus which cut off the head of the wicked fairy and
from there the Discus flew to Kāśi and turned Sudak-
ṣiṇa to ashes, and returned to Dvārakā. (Bhāgavata,
Skandha 10).
