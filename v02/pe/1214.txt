BHUŚUṆḌA¦. A dispassionate and large-hearted crow.
<div n="lb"/>The residence of this crow was a Kalpavṛkṣa standing
<div n="lb"/>on a beautiful peak surrounded by luxuriant vegetation
<div n="lb"/>in the north-eastern corner of Mahāmeru. There were
<div n="lb"/>numerous bird-nests on the southern branch of that
<div n="lb"/>Kalpavṛkṣa. In one of them lived this centuries-old
<div n="lb"/>bird.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the sage Vasiṣṭha went to Devaloka, he
<div n="lb"/>happened to hear about this crow. He went to see
<div n="lb"/>Bhuśuṇḍa in its nest. The crow recognised Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>at once. They exchanged greetings. The sage opened
<div n="lb"/>the conversation as follows:—“Oh, King of birds!
<div n="lb"/>when were you born? How did you become a great
<div n="lb"/>soul? How old are you? Have you recollections of the
<div n="lb"/>past? Who was the prophet who suggested this residence
<div n="lb"/>for you?”
<div n="NI"/>The bird calmly replied as follows:—“If you are interes-
<div n="lb"/>ted in hearing my past history I shall tell you. Lord
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkara the Almighty lives in this world. He has numer-
<div n="lb"/>ous attendant spirits. Besides these spirits who have
<div n="lb"/>hoofs on their head, hands in the hoofs, teeth in
<div n="lb"/>the hands and stomach in the face, and who have faces
<div n="lb"/>resembling those of monkeys, camels, and elephants,
<div n="lb"/>he has also hordes of Mātṛs in his retinue. The Mātṛs,
<div n="lb"/>attended by spirits continue their dance in the presence
<div n="lb"/>of the Lord. Mountain peaks, the sky, the different
<div n="lb"/>worlds, deep pits, cremation grounds, etc. are their
<div n="lb"/>haunts. Chief among these Mātṛs are eight sisters
<div n="lb"/>named, Jayā, Vijayā, Jayantī, Aparāhitā, Siddhā,
<div n="lb"/>Raktā, Alambuṣā and Ulpalā. They have other follow-
<div n="lb"/>ers also. Alambuṣā's vehicle is the crow named Caṇḍa.
[Page144-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>All these Mātṛs assembled together on one occasion to
<div n="lb"/>celebrate a festival in the sky. There was a display of
<div n="lb"/>many kinds of entertainments at that time. Disputations
<div n="lb"/>in spiritual matters, music, dancing, drinking and other
<div n="lb"/>forms of hilarious activities were freely indulged in.
<div n="lb"/>In another part of the sky, their vehicles were also
<div n="lb"/>enjoying themselves with similar celebrations of drinking,
<div n="lb"/>dancing, and merry-making. The swans who were the
<div n="lb"/>vehicles of Brāhmīdevī were dancing in one place,
<div n="lb"/>intoxicated by drink. Caṇḍa, the crow, who was Alam-
<div n="lb"/>buṣā's vehicle, also joined their company. Completely
<div n="lb"/>absorbed in their delirious raptures, the intoxicated
<div n="lb"/>swans indulged so freely in their amorous pleasures with
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍa that they became pregnant. At last when the
<div n="lb"/>merry-makings ended and all of them dispersed, the swans
<div n="lb"/>became aware of their plight and informed Brāhmī
<div n="lb"/>about it. The gracious goddess (Brāhmī) told them
<div n="lb"/>that in their present state they were unable to discharge
<div n="lb"/>their duties in drawing her chariot and so they were allow-
<div n="lb"/>ed to go and enjoy themselves wherever they liked. After
<div n="lb"/>this she entered into a trance. The swans in the fullness
<div n="lb"/>of time, gave birth to twentyone sons. We, the twenty-
<div n="lb"/>one brothers, are those children. We and our mothers
<div n="lb"/>went to Brāhmīdevī and offered worship to her for a
<div n="lb"/>long time. As a result, the Devī woke up from her trance
<div n="lb"/>and pleased with us, gave us her blessing. After that,
<div n="lb"/>we went to our father (Caṇḍa) and off red our devoted
<div n="lb"/>services to him and prostrated before him and Alam-
<div n="lb"/>buṣādevī. They blessed us. We asked our father to
<div n="lb"/>suggest a most suitable place for a secluded life. This
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa Vṛkṣa is the secluded place recommended by
<div n="lb"/>him. We paid obeisance to our father and Alambu-
<div n="lb"/>ṣādevī and came to settle down here. Many ages have
<div n="lb"/>passed since then. Now your visit and holy presence
<div n="lb"/>here, have liberated me from all worldly bonds and
<div n="lb"/>ennobled my life. My twenty brothers lived for many
<div n="lb"/>Kalpas and yugas at the end of which, convinced of the
<div n="lb"/>meaninglessness of worldly life, renounced their bodies
<div n="lb"/>and attained Śivaloka.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Vasiṣṭha asked Bhuśuṇḍa to tell him
<div n="lb"/>more about his past life. Bhuśuṇḍa resumed his story:—
<div n="lb"/>“Long long ago, the whole earth was full of big rocks,
<div n="lb"/>without trees, forests or mountains. After a great flood
<div n="lb"/>the surface of the earth was covered with ashes. In
<div n="lb"/>one caturyuga (a period equal to the length of the four
<div n="lb"/>yugas, Kṛta, tretā, dvāpara and Kali) the earth was
<div n="lb"/>filled with forest trees and in another Caturyuga, moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain ranges appeared. I have seen an age in which
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas were drunkards, Śūdras were virtuous and
<div n="lb"/>women of noble families committed adultery. You
<div n="lb"/>have now been born in the eightieth “Janma” as the
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā. You were born once from the sky, at
<div n="lb"/>another time from water, then from the mountain and
<div n="lb"/>again from fire. I can remember this earth sinking into
<div n="lb"/>the ocean five times and Lord Viṣṇu taking the form of
<div n="lb"/>a tortoise, lifting it up, above the water. I have seen the
<div n="lb"/>ocean of milk being churned twelve times. I know that
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa had taken the earth three times to Pātāla
<div n="lb"/>(underworld). The Lord has incarnated six times as
<div n="lb"/>Bhārgava Rāma. Incarnation of Buddha has taken
<div n="lb"/>place in six Kaliyugas. Tripuradahana (burning of
<div n="lb"/>the Tripurāsuras) has taken place thirty times. Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>yāga was broken up twice. Lord Śiva has slain ten
<div n="lb"/>Indras. He fought seven times with Śrī Kṛṣṇa for the
<div n="lb"/>sake of Bāṇa. I also remember another epic entitled
[Page145-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>“Rāmāyaṇa”, containing one lakh of verses and dealing
<div n="lb"/>with metaphysical problems. I have seen the customs
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛtayuga being followed in Kaliyuga and the customs
<div n="lb"/>of Kaliyuga being followed in Kṛtayuga.”
<div n="NI"/>Having heard the whole story, Vasiṣṭha gave his blessing
<div n="lb"/>to Bhuśuṇḍa and left the place. (Jñāna Vāsiṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>Bhu uṇḍopākhyāna).
