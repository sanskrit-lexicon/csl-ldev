AMPIṬṬA¦. A name for barbers. ‘Ampiṭṭa’ is derived from
the Sanskrit word “Ambiṣṭhaḥ”. The word Ambiṣṭhaḥ
means Physician. In olden days barbers were physicians
also. Going about from house to house, they could easily
practise both these professions. Since barbers practised
physic also they were called Ambiṣṭhas. Ampiṭṭa is a
corrupted form of Ambiṣṭha. (Dravidian Philology).
<div n="NI"/>Barbers sometimes style themselves as “Pandits”. It
is on the basis of this that we have today, “All Kerala
Pandit Sabha” and other similar names. There is a
legend on the basis of which this community has assum-
ed the title of “Pandit”.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago when Śrī Buddha was about to go to the
forest for performing Tapas, thousands of people flocked
together to have his darśana. Buddha wished to continue
his journey after shaving his head. Buddha asked loudly
whether anyone in the crowd was prepared to shave
his head. Only a single man came forward cheerfully to
do that work. Buddha turned to him and said: “My
dear friend, you are the only Pandit in this crowd. You
have the wisdom to understand that there is nothing
disgraceful in shaving one's head.”
<div n="NI"/>He shaved Buddha's head. From that day his descen-
dants came to be known as “Pandits”.
