AMPIṬṬA¦. A name for barbers. ‘Ampiṭṭa’ is derived from
<div n="lb"/>the Sanskrit word “Ambiṣṭhaḥ”. The word Ambiṣṭhaḥ
<div n="lb"/>means Physician. In olden days barbers were physicians
<div n="lb"/>also. Going about from house to house, they could easily
<div n="lb"/>practise both these professions. Since barbers practised
<div n="lb"/>physic also they were called Ambiṣṭhas. Ampiṭṭa is a
<div n="lb"/>corrupted form of Ambiṣṭha. (Dravidian Philology).
<div n="NI"/>Barbers sometimes style themselves as “Pandits”. It
<div n="lb"/>is on the basis of this that we have today, “All Kerala
<div n="lb"/>Pandit Sabha” and other similar names. There is a
<div n="lb"/>legend on the basis of which this community has assum-
<div n="lb"/>ed the title of “Pandit”.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago when Śrī Buddha was about to go to the
<div n="lb"/>forest for performing Tapas, thousands of people flocked
<div n="lb"/>together to have his darśana. Buddha wished to continue
<div n="lb"/>his journey after shaving his head. Buddha asked loudly
<div n="lb"/>whether anyone in the crowd was prepared to shave
<div n="lb"/>his head. Only a single man came forward cheerfully to
<div n="lb"/>do that work. Buddha turned to him and said: “My
<div n="lb"/>dear friend, you are the only Pandit in this crowd. You
<div n="lb"/>have the wisdom to understand that there is nothing
<div n="lb"/>disgraceful in shaving one's head.”
<div n="NI"/>He shaved Buddha's head. From that day his descen-
<div n="lb"/>dants came to be known as “Pandits”.
