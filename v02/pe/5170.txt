PHENAPA¦. A gotra-maker of the Bhṛgu family.
Phenapa is mentioned in the context of describing to
Yudhiṣṭhira the greatness of cows. Phenapa's original
name was Sumitra. He lived on the shores of the river
Kulajā in the mountain of Triśikhara drinking the
foam of cow's milk alone and thus getting for him the
name Phenapa. (Phena = foam; Pā = drink). (Anuśāsana
Parva, M.B.)
