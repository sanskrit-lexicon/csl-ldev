PUṆḌARĪKAMUKHA¦. An eminent serpent King. His
<div n="lb"/>subjects, Puṇḍarīkamukhas, lived with him in the
<div n="lb"/>beautiful serpent-city surrounded on all sides by gold
<div n="lb"/>castles. Gandharvas and Kinnaras of both sexes lived
<div n="lb"/>inside the city. A Gandharva of name Lalita fell in
<div n="lb"/>love with a Gandharva lady named Lalitā and they
<div n="lb"/>lived there happily enjoying amorous sports. One day
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍarīkamukha held a music concert in which Lalita
<div n="lb"/>was asked to sing as the leading musician. His love
<div n="lb"/>Lalitā was absent at the assembly and Lalita could
<div n="lb"/>not sing or dance in proper form that day. Karkaṭaka,
<div n="lb"/>a serpent chief, privately informed his King the reason
<div n="lb"/>for the poor display of Lalita that day. The King got
<div n="lb"/>angry and cursed Lalita thus: “Wicked one, you will
<div n="lb"/>be born as a man-eating rākṣasa. This is the penalty
<div n="lb"/>for thinking about your wife while singing for me.”
<div n="NI"/>Lalita immediately became an ugly, fierce-looking
<div n="lb"/>demon. Lalitā deeply mourned over this pitiable plight
<div n="lb"/>of her husband and followed him in the forests where
<div n="lb"/>he roamed about making loud roaring sounds. While
<div n="lb"/>they were thus wandering in the forests, they found a
<div n="lb"/>pretty āśrama in which there was an ascetic engaged
<div n="lb"/>in penance. Lalitā stood before him with tears rolling
<div n="lb"/>down her cheeks. When the sage opened his eyes
<div n="lb"/>Lalitā told him that she was the daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva named Vīradhanvā and that her husband
<div n="lb"/>had become a demon by the curse of the serpent King
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍarīkamukha. The sage advised her to observe
<div n="lb"/>Ekādaśī Vrata. She observed the Vrata with devotion
<div n="lb"/>and her husband Lalita, was freed from the curse. He
<div n="lb"/>became the former handsome Gandharva once again.
<div n="lb"/>They then went back to Gandharvaloka. (Chapter 49,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāga 4, Padma Purāṇa).
