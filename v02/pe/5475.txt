PUṆḌARĪKAMUKHA¦. An eminent serpent King. His
subjects, Puṇḍarīkamukhas, lived with him in the
beautiful serpent-city surrounded on all sides by gold
castles. Gandharvas and Kinnaras of both sexes lived
inside the city. A Gandharva of name Lalita fell in
love with a Gandharva lady named Lalitā and they
lived there happily enjoying amorous sports. One day
Puṇḍarīkamukha held a music concert in which Lalita
was asked to sing as the leading musician. His love
Lalitā was absent at the assembly and Lalita could
not sing or dance in proper form that day. Karkaṭaka,
a serpent chief, privately informed his King the reason
for the poor display of Lalita that day. The King got
angry and cursed Lalita thus: “Wicked one, you will
be born as a man-eating rākṣasa. This is the penalty
for thinking about your wife while singing for me.”
<div n="NI"/>Lalita immediately became an ugly, fierce-looking
demon. Lalitā deeply mourned over this pitiable plight
of her husband and followed him in the forests where
he roamed about making loud roaring sounds. While
they were thus wandering in the forests, they found a
pretty āśrama in which there was an ascetic engaged
in penance. Lalitā stood before him with tears rolling
down her cheeks. When the sage opened his eyes
Lalitā told him that she was the daughter of the
Gandharva named Vīradhanvā and that her husband
had become a demon by the curse of the serpent King
Puṇḍarīkamukha. The sage advised her to observe
Ekādaśī Vrata. She observed the Vrata with devotion
and her husband Lalita, was freed from the curse. He
became the former handsome Gandharva once again.
They then went back to Gandharvaloka. (Chapter 49,
Bhāga 4, Padma Purāṇa).
