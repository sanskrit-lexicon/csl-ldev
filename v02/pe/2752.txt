INDRADYUMNA I¦. A King born in the dynasty of
<div n="lb"/>Svāyambhuva Manu, and a king of the Pāṇḍya
<div n="lb"/>country.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in this order:—
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu—Brahmā—Svāyambhuva Manu—Priya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata—Agnīdhra—Nābhi—Ṛṣabha—Bharata—
<div n="lb"/>Sumati—Indradyumna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indradyumna turned into elephant.%} Indradyumna, a
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Viṣṇu handed over governance of the country
<div n="lb"/>to his children when he became old, and performed
<div n="lb"/>penance in the Malaya mountain. One day, when he
<div n="lb"/>was immersed in meditation Agastya came there. Natu-
<div n="lb"/>rally, Indradyumna did not notice Agastya's arrival.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this the latter cursed Indradyumna and
<div n="lb"/>turned him into an elephant. Being told immediately
<div n="lb"/>about the curse by his servants Indradyumna sought
<div n="lb"/>redemption from the curse from Agastya himself. Redemp-
<div n="lb"/>tion was granted thus: Indradyumna would roam in
<div n="lb"/>the forest for years as an elephant, a devotee of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and he would attain salvation when Lord Viṣṇu came
<div n="lb"/>down to the earth and patted the elephant on its back.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Indradyumna who was turned into an ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant roamed about in the forest for many years in the
<div n="lb"/>company of a herd of wild elephants. At last it arrived
<div n="lb"/>at Mount Trikūṭa. There was a lake there on the banks
<div n="lb"/>of which was sage Devala engaged in penance. Hūhū,
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharva had once come to this lake with a num-
<div n="lb"/>ber of Apsarā women and they indulged in amorous
<div n="lb"/>sports, which Devala did not like. He cursed Hūhū and
<div n="lb"/>turned him into a crocodile, and the crocodile lived in
<div n="lb"/>the same lake.
<div n="NI"/>Indradyumna who was turned into an elephant, stepped
<div n="lb"/>into the lake to drink water when the crocodile caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of its hind leg. Neither did the elephant yield nor
[Page329-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the crocodile leave the former free. Their tug of war
<div n="lb"/>continued for 1000 years when Mahāviṣṇu appeared
<div n="lb"/>on the scene, killed the crocodile and saved the
<div n="lb"/>elephant. At once the elephant was re-transformed
<div n="lb"/>into Indradyumna and he attained Vaikuṇṭha (the
<div n="lb"/>abode of Viṣṇu). (Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>A Malayalam verse summarises the above story as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—Impelled by Agastya's curse the elephant
<div n="lb"/>went to the lake at Mount Trikūṭa, and suffered for
<div n="lb"/>1000 years as the crocodile which caught hold of its
<div n="lb"/>hind leg did not loosen its grip. Then appeared on the
<div n="lb"/>scene the killer of Murāsura (Lord Viṣṇu) on his
<div n="lb"/>vehicle, Garuḍa, killed the crocodile with his discus
<div n="lb"/>and granted salvation to the elephant.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indradyumna's fall from heaven when the merits of his good%}
<div n="lb"/>{%deeds were exhausted.%} The merits or the result of his
<div n="lb"/>good and noble deeds having been exhausted, Indra-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna, the saintly king once descended from heaven
<div n="lb"/>to earth, and the sad King approached sage Mārkaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍeya. But, the sage did not recognize him. The King
<div n="lb"/>and the sage went to Prāvīrakarṇa, an owl living on
<div n="lb"/>the top of the Himālayas. It also did not recognise the
<div n="lb"/>King. Then they went to Nāḍījaṃgha, a stork very
<div n="lb"/>much older than the owl and living in the lake known
<div n="lb"/>as Indradyumna. Nāḍījaṃgha also could not recognise
<div n="lb"/>the King. In another part of the lake was living a
<div n="lb"/>tortoise called Akūpāra, who was older than Nāḍī-
<div n="lb"/>jaṃgha. At last the King, the sage, Prāvīrakarṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Nāḍījaṃgha approached Akūpāra. At his very sight
<div n="lb"/>Akūpāra recognized the King. Akūpāra told sage
<div n="lb"/>Mārkaṇḍeya that Indradyumna was a very famous
<div n="lb"/>King and quite liberal and munificent in distributing
<div n="lb"/>gifts, and that the lake Indradyumna was formed by
<div n="lb"/>the passage of the cows gifted by the King. Having
<div n="lb"/>heard these details regarding the King the sage sent
<div n="lb"/>him back to heaven. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 199).
