KAŚYAPA I¦. Chief among the Prajāpatis.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Kaśyapa—Son or Grandson of Brahmā?%} It is impossible
to give a definite answer to this question. In Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, we see that six spirit-
ual sons—Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and
Kratu—were born to Brahmā. Kaśyapa was born as
the son of Marīci and that all living beings in the
world took their origin from Kaśyapa. According to
this statement, Kaśyapa is the grandson of Brahmā.
[Page396-b+ 65]
But in the 14th Sarga of Araṇyakāṇḍa in Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa there is an account of the creation of all
animate and inanimate objects in this world. According
to a statement in that passage, we find that Kaśyapa
was the youngest brother of Marīci, Atri, Pulastya and
others. This means that Kaśyapa was the son of Brahmā.
Therefore there is nothing wrong in regarding him
either as the son or as the grandson of Brahmā. In the
Purāṇas we find references to him in both ways.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Original Gotra or Clan.%} Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva,
Chapter 297, verse 17 says that all living beings belong
to the four original Gotras—the gotra of Aṅgiras,
Kaśyapa gotra, Bhṛgu gotra and Vasiṣṭha gotra and
that all the other gotras came into existence subse-
quently.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kaśyapa's wives.%} Kaśyapa had 21 wives who were:—
Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ariṣṭā, Surasā. Khaśā, Surabhi,
Vinatā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Irā, Kadrū, Muni,
Pulomā, Kālakā, Natā, Danāyus, Siṃhikā, Pradhā,
Viśvā, and Kapilā. Of these, the 13 wives, Aditi, Diti,
Kālakā, Danāyus, Danu, Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pradhā,
Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā, Muni and Kadrū, were the
daughters of Dakṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Of these the first wife Aditi had 12 sons. These 12 sons
namely Viṣṇu, Śakra, Aryamā, Dhātā, Tvaṣṭā, Pūṣā,
Vivasvān, Savitā, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aṃśa and Bhaga are
called Ādityas (sons of Aditi). In the sixth Manvantara
these 12 Ādityas belonged to the tribe known as Tuṣitas.
(The present Manvantara is the seventh one). The 33
crores of Devas came into being from the twelve
Ādityas.
<div n="NI"/>The Daityas were born from Kaśyapa's second wife
Diti. The chief Daityas are Hiraṇyakaśipu, Hiraṇyākṣa
and Siṃhikā. All the other Daityas were born from
them.
<div n="NI"/>The Dānavas were the children of Danu, another wife
of Kaśyapa. Dvimūrdhā, Śambara, Ayomukha, Śaṅku-
śiras, Kapila, Śaṅkara, Ekacakra, Mahābāhu, Tāraka,
Mahābala, Svarbhānu, Vṛṣaparvā, Pulomā, and Vipra-
citti are the famous Dānavas. The other Dānavas were
the children of the people mentioned above.
<div n="NI"/>Another wife of Kaśyapa, Surabhi gave birth to Aja,
Ekapād, Ahirbuddhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra and also
the Ekādaśa Rudras namely:—Hara, Bahurūpa, Tryam-
baka, Aparājita, Vṛṣākapi, Śambhu, Kapardī, Raivata,
Mṛgavyādha, Sarpa, and Kapālī. Vinatā gave birth to
Garuḍa and Kadrū was the mother of the nāgas. The
Purāṇas proclaim that all living beings that we see in
the world today, sprang from Kaśyapa's offsprings by
his different wives. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa,
Chapter 29; Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapters 15-21;
Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapters 16 and 65 and
Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Brahmā taught Kaśyapa cure for snake poison.%} The ser-
pents (Nāgas) were born to Kadrū, one of the wives
of Kaśyapa. Once Kadrū asked her children to hang
down like hair from the tail of Uccaiśśravas. They
refused to do so. Kadrū became angry and cursed them
that they would be burnt alive at Janamejaya's Sarpa
Sattra (snake-sacrifice). After the curse, the Nāgas
became dangerously venomous. At this stage, Brahmā
taught Kaśyapa the art of curing snake-poison to
protect other creatures that might be bitten by the
Nāgas. Cure of snake-bite in this world dates from
that time. (M.B. Ādi Parva. Chapter 20).
[Page397-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaśy pa and Garuḍa.%} Garuḍa is a mighty son of
Kaśyapa by his wife Vinatā. Vinatā made a bet with
her sister Kadrū. Kadrū won the bet. Vinatā became
Kadrū's maid-servant as a result of the bet. To be
relieved of this bondage Vinatā's son Garuḍa had to
bring Amṛta from Devaloka and give it to Kadrū and
her Nāga-sons. Garuḍa agreed and flew up to Heaven
to fetch Amṛta.
<div n="NI"/>On the way, he visited his father Kaśyapa who was
performing penance on the Gandhamādana mountain.
He asked his father to give him some food, as he was
very hungry. Kaśyapa told him the following story:—
“Long ago a sage named Vibhāvasu lived near this place.
He and his younger brother named Supratīka began to
quarrel over the sharing of their father's wealth. The
elder brother transformed the younger brother into an
elephant by a curse and the younger brother turned
the elder into a tortoise by his curse. They are still
living in yonder lake as elephant and tortoise and
continue like enemies. If you eat both of them, you will
be strong enough to fight against the Devas and get
possession of Amṛta for yourself.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Garuḍa went to the lake and caught
the elephant and tortoise in his claws and flew up into
the sky. The mountains began to tremble and a whirl-
wind swept the Heavens when Garuḍa beat with his
wings. He flew about here and there unable to find a
convenient place to sit and enjoy his meal. On the way,
his eye caught sight of a huge banyan tree spreading its
branches far and wide, to a distance of 100 yojanas
around it. When he perched on one of its branches
with the elephant and tortoise, the branch broke and
fell down. From that branch certain sages known as
Bālakhilyas were hanging with their heads downwards.
So, to prevent them from falling to the ground, Garuḍa
lifted it in his beak and began to fly up again. Unable
to find a suitable spot where he could deposit the
branch with the sages, Garuḍa returned to his father
again. At the request of Kaśyapa, the Bālakhilyas went
to the Himālayas. He showed Garuḍa a vast, snow-
clad mountain on which he could deposit the broken
branch he was carrying. Garuḍa flew to that mountain
and ate up the elephant and tortoise and thus gained
strength to fight with the Devas for Amṛta. After that
he proceeded to Heaven. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters
29-31).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other Birth of Kaśyapa.%} In Cākṣuṣa Manvantara, the
sage Sutapas performed a penance along with his wife
Pṛśni for 12,000 years. Lord Viṣṇu appeared to them
and asked what boon they wished to ask. They prayed
that the Lord should take birth as their son. Viṣṇu
granted their prayer and was born as their son.
<div n="NI"/>In the next Manvantara (the period of Vaivasvata
Manu) Sutapas and Pṛśni were re-born as Kaśyapa
and Aditi respectively. At that time also Mahāviṣṇu
was born to Aditi as Vāmana. (See under Vāmana).
In this birth, Kaśyapa had many other wives besides
Aditi. Surasā was one of those wives. (Bhāgavata, 10th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>It was this Kaśyapa himself who was reborn as Vasu-
deva and Aditi became Devakī. Surasā was born as
Rohiṇī, another wife. There is another reason for
Kaśyapa and Aditi to take birth for the third time.
Once Kaśyapa had prepared to perform a Yāga. All
arrangements were complete. But the sacrificial cow
[Page397-b+ 64]
alone was not available. Kaśyapa solved the problem
by stealing a cow from Varuṇa's cattle-shed. Aditi and
Surasā concealed it in the Āśrama. Enraged at the
theft of his cow, Varuṇa complained to Brahmā. A
curse was pronounced by Brahmā and Varuṇa that as
a punishment for stealing and hiding the cow, Kaśyapa
should be reborn as a cowherd and Aditi and Surasā
should be reborn as the cowherd's wives. It was by
this curse that Kaśyapa, Aditi and Surasā were reborn
as Vasudeva Devakī and Rohiṇī respectively. (Devī
Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Paraśurāma's gift of land to Kaśyapa.%} Paraśurāma
performed a Yāga after exterminating all Kṣatriya
Kings. At that Yāga he gifted all the lands he had
conquered till then to Kaśyapa. In Mahābhārata,
Araṇya Parva, Chapter 117, there is a reference to this
gift.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kaśyapa and Kerala.%} After Paraśurāma went round
the world eighteen times and exterminated the
Kṣatriya Kings he performed a Yāga. At that Yāga he
gave the whole earth as dakṣiṇā to Kaśyapa. After that,
Kaśyapa drove away Paraśurāma from the earth to
the south. Taking pity on Paraśurāma, the ocean gave
him the region known as “Śūrpāraka”. Kaśyapa seized
Śūrpāraka also from Paraśurāma and gave it to
Brāhmaṇas. Paraśurāma went to the forests after it.
Later on, intermixture of castes took place in this region
and anarchy prevailed there. At one time, Śūrpāraka
sank down into Pātāla (lower world). Kaśyapa who
saw this held the earth up, brought Kṣatriyas from the
north and made them rulers of the country. (M.B.
Śānti Parva, Chapter 49). This “Śūrpāraka” is believed
to be Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other Details about Kaśyapa.%}

by his austere penance. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
114).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) After Paraśurāma had given the entire earth to
Kaśyapa, Kaśyapa drove away Paraśurāma from the
