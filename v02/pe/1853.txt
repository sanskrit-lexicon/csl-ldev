DEVARĀTA III¦. A house-holder whose daughter Kalā
was married by Śoṇa. Kalā was killed by Mārīca.
Devarāta and Śoṇa along with Viśvāmitra went to
Śivaloka in search of Kalā. As Kalā had, at the time
of her death, uttered the word ‘Hara’ (Śiva) she had
gone to Mount Kailāsa and was spending her days in the
service of Pārvatī who, after making Kalā and Śoṇa
participate in Somavāravrata sent them back to earth.
