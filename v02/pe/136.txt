ṚCĪKA¦ I
<div n="NI"/>King Hariścandra who was distressed by having no
children, propitiated god Varuṇa. Varuṇa blessed
him saying that a son would be born to him. But
the condition was that the child should be sacrificed
to Varuṇa. When the child was born, Hariścandra did
not like to sacrifice the boy. The sage Viśvāmitra suggest-
ed that instead of sacrificing his own son it would be
enough if he bought another boy and sacrificed him.
Accordingly, Hariścandra sent his minister to find out
and purchase a Brahmin boy for the sacrifice. At that
time there lived in Ayodhyā a greedy Brahmin named
Ajīgarta. He had three sons. In the course of his search,
the minister came across this needy Brahmin and asked
him whether he was willing to sell one of his three sons.
He continued: “Why should you be in this wretched
state of poverty and misery? Sell one of your sons and
you will get 100 cows as the price”. The minister's
words and the price offered for the son made a deep
impression on the Brahmin's mind. He thought:
“It is impossible for me to earn 100 cows. Even if it were
possible how long would it take? If I sell him I shall
get hundred cows at once. What a lucky chance! The
loss of a son is nothing.” So thinking, he sold his son
Śunaśśepha. (For the rest of the story, see the word
“Śunaśśepha”. Devī Bhāgavata, Skandhas 7, 8).
