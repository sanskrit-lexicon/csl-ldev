BHAṬṬANĀYAKA¦. A literary critic who flourished in
the 10th century A.D. in India. He composed a critical
study on the science of dance (Nāṭya) named Hṛdaya-
darpaṇa based on the Nāṭya śāstra of Bharata. But,
the book has not been found out, yet. Contesting the
dhvanivāda (the rhetorical theory that in poetry sugges-
ted or implied meaning is superior to the explicit mean-
ning) of Ānandavardhanācārya, he established the rasa-
vāda (that sentiment is supreme in poetry). Abhi-
navagupta also has supported the rasavāda. Hence,
it may be inferred that Bhaṭṭanāyaka lived in the period
after Ānandavardhana and anterior to Abhinavagupta.
Bhaṭṭanāyaka's theory is that Abhidhā, Bhāvakatvaṃ
and Bhojakatvaṃ should be the three excellences of
good poetry.
