BHAṬṬANĀYAKA¦. A literary critic who flourished in
<div n="lb"/>the 10th century A.D. in India. He composed a critical
<div n="lb"/>study on the science of dance (Nāṭya) named Hṛdaya-
<div n="lb"/>darpaṇa based on the Nāṭya śāstra of Bharata. But,
<div n="lb"/>the book has not been found out, yet. Contesting the
<div n="lb"/>dhvanivāda (the rhetorical theory that in poetry sugges-
<div n="lb"/>ted or implied meaning is superior to the explicit mean-
<div n="lb"/>ning) of Ānandavardhanācārya, he established the rasa-
<div n="lb"/>vāda (that sentiment is supreme in poetry). Abhi-
<div n="lb"/>navagupta also has supported the rasavāda. Hence,
<div n="lb"/>it may be inferred that Bhaṭṭanāyaka lived in the period
<div n="lb"/>after Ānandavardhana and anterior to Abhinavagupta.
<div n="lb"/>Bhaṭṭanāyaka's theory is that Abhidhā, Bhāvakatvaṃ
<div n="lb"/>and Bhojakatvaṃ should be the three excellences of
<div n="lb"/>good poetry.
