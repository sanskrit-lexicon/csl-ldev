TVAṢṬĀ I¦. A Prajāpati. This Prajāpati was an asura
<div n="lb"/>also. (Sūkta 94, Anuvāka 14, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveḍa).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} There are contradictory statements in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas regarding the birth of Tvaṣṭā.
<div n="NI"/>(a) Viśvakarmā got four sons named Ahirbudhnya,
<div n="lb"/>Tvaṣṭā Ajaikapāt and Rudra. The great ascetic Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>rūpa was the son of Tvaṣṭā. (Chapter 15, Aṃśa 1,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
[Page800-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(b) Kaśyapa got as his sons the Ekādaśarudras of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Surabhi. Surabhi who became pure by penance got by
<div n="lb"/>the grace of Mahādeva five other sons named Aja,
<div n="lb"/>Ekapāt, Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra. The noble
<div n="lb"/>and famous Viśvarūpa was the son of Tvaṣṭā. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>18, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(c) Kaśyapa Maharṣi got a son named Tvaṣṭā of his
<div n="lb"/>wife Aditi. (Śloka 34, Chapter 226, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Because of such varied statements it is not possible to
<div n="lb"/>say whose son Tvaṣṭā was.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indra's enemy.%} Even from the beginning, Tvaṣṭā
<div n="lb"/>hated Indra. Tvaṣṭā begot of his wife Recanā a son
<div n="lb"/>named Viśvarūpa to kill Indra. Viśvarūpa was the
<div n="lb"/>younger brother of Sanniveśa. Viśvarūpa was called
<div n="lb"/>Triśiras also. (See under Triśiras). While Viśvarūpa
<div n="lb"/>was doing penance Indra killed him by his Vajrāyudha.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged at this Tvaṣṭā produced another asura named
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra to kill Indra. (See under Vṛtra). Indra killed
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtrāsura also. At last greatly disappointed Tvaṣṭā
<div n="lb"/>cursed Indra that he would suffer from Putraduḥkha
<div n="lb"/>(loss of son) and then went to the mount Meru to do
<div n="lb"/>penance.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Tvaṣṭā also treated as a Rudra. (Chapter 15, Aṃ a
<div n="lb"/>1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) When the forest of Khāṇḍava was burnt, he stood
<div n="lb"/>on the side of Indra and fought against Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. He separated huge portions from the mountain
<div n="lb"/>and threw them against Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. (Śloka 34,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 226, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Tvaṣṭā shines in the court of Indra. (Śloka 14,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Kuśeru, daughter of Tvaṣṭā was once abducted
<div n="lb"/>by Narakāsura. (Chapter 38, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Viśvakarmā also used to be called Tvaṣṭā. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>24, Chapter 100, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) The monkey called Nala was the son of Tvaṣṭā.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 41, Chapter 283, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Tvaṣṭā presented Subrahmaṇya with two Pārṣa-
<div n="lb"/>das named Cakra and Anucakra. (Śloka 40, Chapter
