CANDRAŚARMĀ I¦. A great sinner, who killed his
<div n="lb"/>preceptor. The Padma Purāṇa relates the story of four
<div n="lb"/>sinners named Vidura, Candraśarman, Vedaśarman
<div n="lb"/>and Vañjula, who shed their sin by bathing in the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā. The sins committed by the four were respectively
<div n="lb"/>Brahmahatyā (killing of brahmin), Guruhatyā (killing
<div n="lb"/>of the preceptor), Agamyāgamana (having sexual con-
<div n="lb"/>tact with women like the wife of guru which is debarred)
<div n="lb"/>and Govadha (killing of cow) respectively. The leader
<div n="lb"/>of the above four sinners was one Vidura of the Pāñcāla
<div n="lb"/>deśa. He was begging in the streets without the tuft
<div n="lb"/>of hair, the sacred thread and tilaka (mark of sandal
<div n="lb"/>paste etc. on the forehead). He went from house to
<div n="lb"/>house begging for alms crying thus: “Here is come the
<div n="lb"/>man (himself) who committed Brahmahatyā. Please
[Page174-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>give alms to the brahmin-killer who is a drunkard also.”
<div n="lb"/>During his begging tour he visited all the tīrthas also,
<div n="lb"/>yet brahmahatyā stuck on to him.
<div n="NI"/>While this sinner Vidura, his heart rent with sorrow and
<div n="lb"/>remorse, was sitting under a tree, a Māgadha brahmin
<div n="lb"/>called Candraśarman happened to come there. This
<div n="lb"/>brahmin had committed the sin of guruhatyā (killing the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor). He told Vidura:—“While residing with the
<div n="lb"/>guru, blinded by desire, I killed the guru, and am now
<div n="lb"/>burning myself in the fire of repentance.”
<div n="NI"/>While they were engaged thus in conversation a third
<div n="lb"/>person, called Vedaśarman also came there in an absolu-
<div n="lb"/>tely tired condition. He told Vidura and Candraśarman
<div n="lb"/>that his relatives and others had cast him out as he once
<div n="lb"/>did the sin of agamyāgamana, and by the time he had
<div n="lb"/>finished telling his story a Vaiśya called Vañjula came
<div n="lb"/>there. Besides drinking liquor he had committed govadha
<div n="lb"/>(killing of cow) also. Though these four sinners assemb-
<div n="lb"/>led at the same place, they only talked, but did not touch
<div n="lb"/>one another, take food together, rest on the same seat
<div n="lb"/>or lie on the same bedsheet.
<div n="NI"/>According to the advice of a Siddha (an evolved soul)
<div n="lb"/>the four sinners dived in the holy waters of Gaṅgā and
<div n="lb"/>came out redeemed of their sins. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 91).
