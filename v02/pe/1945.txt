DHARMĀṄGADA¦. A Brahmin who became a deep
meditator on Viṣṇu, because of his habits in his previous
life. Dharmāṅgada was the son of Rukmāṅgada by
his wife Sandhyāvalī. Rukmāṅgada was the son of
Ṛtadhvaja who lived in the city of Vidiśā. He was
a man of good personality, who lived with his
father and being a generous man he did not hesitate to
give his head to Mohinī for the pleasure of his father.
God Viṣṇu was pleased with him because of his love of
his father and of his loyalty to Vaiṣṇavite deity and took
him bodily to heaven (Vaikuṇṭha). Dharmāṅgada

lived there for many thousands of years enjoying heaven-
ly pleasures. Then he went astray from divine life
and had to take life again as Suvrata the son of a
Brahmin named Somaśarmā.
<div n="NI"/>The wise Suvrata discarded the passions of Kāma (desire),
Krodha (anger) etc. and controlled his senses and engag-
ed himself in penance in Vaiḍūryamahādri. For hun-
dred years he sat in meditation and Mahāviṣṇu was
pleased with him and took him and his father to
Vaikuṇṭha. At the instruction of Mahāviṣṇu, Suvrata
took life again in the house of Kaśyapa. When he died
he went to Vaikuṇṭha. In every successive birth he had
the remembrance of his previous birth. (Padma Purāṇa,
Chapter 21).
