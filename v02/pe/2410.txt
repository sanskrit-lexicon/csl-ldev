GHANAPĀṬHA¦. A particular system of Vedic studies.
<div n="lb"/>There are four such systems. The system of separating
<div n="lb"/>each word from conjunctions and combinations and
<div n="lb"/>combining with the word just before and after it is
<div n="lb"/>called Jaṭāpāṭha. Jaṭāpāṭha means joined or combined
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭha. Ghanapāṭha is there to avoid errors in Jaṭāpāṭha
<div n="lb"/>Ghanapāṭha consists of padapāṭha and Kramapāṭha.
<div n="lb"/>In Padapāṭha the split words are once more combined
<div n="lb"/>and Prātiśākhya lays down the rules to combine words.
<div n="lb"/>It is because of this scientific system of reciting that
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛgveda remains to this day pure in text without
<div n="lb"/>different readings.
