LAVAṆA II¦. A King who was a grandson of Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra. He once conducted a Rājasūya in his
<div n="lb"/>imagination and became a Caṇḍāla. (story in
<div n="lb"/>Jñānavāsiṣṭha). This story was narrated to Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>by Vasiṣṭha to teach him the truth that man does not
<div n="lb"/>realise that this whole universe is an illusion only
<div n="lb"/>because of his ignorance.
[Page452-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Lavaṇa was the King of Uttarapāṇḍava, a country of
<div n="lb"/>great fame. He was the grandson of Hariścandra and
<div n="lb"/>wished to earn fame by performing a Rājasūya yāga
<div n="lb"/>as Hariścandra had done. Lavaṇa decided to perform
<div n="lb"/>the yāga in his mind only. He made grand prepara-
<div n="lb"/>tions for the yajña. He invited the Ṛtviks and after
<div n="lb"/>invoking the devas inflamed the sacrificial fire. For one
<div n="lb"/>year he observed yāga like that and in the end gave
<div n="lb"/>gifts to the brahmins and the poor. It was all an
<div n="lb"/>imaginary performance that the King had in the
<div n="lb"/>course of a single day when he indulged in a reverie.
<div n="lb"/>In the evening as usual he continued his day to day
<div n="lb"/>duties.
<div n="NI"/>One who performs Rājasūya will have to bear woes and
<div n="lb"/>sorrows for a period of twelve years and since Lavaṇa
<div n="lb"/>had performed it mentally, Indra sent his agent to
<div n="lb"/>give Lavaṇa worries mentally. Indra's agent appeared
<div n="lb"/>in the court of King Lavaṇa in the guise of a magician.
<div n="lb"/>The magician bowing before the King with awe said,
<div n="lb"/>“Lord, I shall show you a magic. See it sitting on
<div n="lb"/>your throne. It will be as astounding as if seeing moon
<div n="lb"/>rise on the earth”.
<div n="NI"/>Saying this the magician took a bundle of peacock-
<div n="lb"/>feathers and waved it against the face of the King.
<div n="lb"/>That bundle was capable of producing different
<div n="lb"/>objects and visions. The King fixed his eyes on the
<div n="lb"/>several glittering spots on the feathers and soon he
<div n="lb"/>saw a relative of the Saindhava King approaching the
<div n="lb"/>court. Behind him was a beautiful horse. Holding the
<div n="lb"/>horse by the reins the new-comer addressed the
<div n="lb"/>King thus. “Lord, this horse is as good as Uccaiśśravas
<div n="lb"/>and it has been sent by the King of Sindhu to be
<div n="lb"/>presented to you. Best things should be given to the
<div n="lb"/>best people and only then the value of the thing
<div n="lb"/>would be correctly understood.” The magician who
<div n="lb"/>was standing near-by supported the statement of the
<div n="lb"/>new-comer. He said “Lord, what he says is true. This
<div n="lb"/>horse has wonderful powers. Take a tour of all the
<div n="lb"/>worlds riding on this horse”. The King sat staring at
<div n="lb"/>the horse and he sat thus for an hour and a half. The
<div n="lb"/>entire court was perplexed.
<div n="NI"/>After some time the King awoke from his meditation
<div n="lb"/>and looking at his courtiers in wonder he said thus:
<div n="lb"/>“I shall tell you what happened to me during the
<div n="lb"/>short period I was sitting in meditation. While I was
<div n="lb"/>looking at the peacock feathers of the magician I felt
<div n="lb"/>a desire to go hunting riding on this horse. So I went
<div n="lb"/>to the forest alone riding on this horse. Very quickly
<div n="lb"/>the horse took me a long distance deviating from the
<div n="lb"/>main path and I soon found myself in the dark depths
<div n="lb"/>of a huge forest. By the time we reached that forest
<div n="lb"/>my mind and body were equally tired and still we
<div n="lb"/>went on moving till evening came. Somehow we
<div n="lb"/>crossed the forest and reached Jāṅgala. There I found
<div n="lb"/>a cluster of lemon trees and to ease my body I caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of a creeper hanging from one of the lemon trees.
<div n="lb"/>As I did so, to my horror, I found the horse running
<div n="lb"/>away from me and leaving me alone. Tired by the
<div n="lb"/>day's travel I sat at a place and dozed. Darkness was
<div n="lb"/>creeping in and soon the whole place was in complete
<div n="lb"/>darkness. It was very cold also. Somehow I spent the
<div n="lb"/>night and when morning came, with hopes I walked
<div n="lb"/>around the place. The place was still and no living
<div n="lb"/>thing was in sight. As I roamed about I saw a forest-
[Page452-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>girl coming with a pot of rice. I approached her and
<div n="lb"/>asked for some rice. She did not pay any attention to
<div n="lb"/>my request and moved on. I followed her and she
<div n="lb"/>said she would give me rice if I promised to marry
<div n="lb"/>her. In despair I agreed to her condition and she was
<div n="lb"/>pleased with my reply. She gave me half of the rice
<div n="lb"/>and curry she was carrying to her father and also some
<div n="lb"/>lemon-juice to drink. After taking that food I rested
<div n="lb"/>for a while.
<div n="NI"/>Her name was Hārakeyūrī. As soon as her father
<div n="lb"/>came from the fields she told him everything. The
<div n="lb"/>caṇḍāla was immensely pleased to hear about our
<div n="lb"/>marriage and all of us went to their hut. The scene I
<div n="lb"/>saw at the hut was astonishing. At one place was the
<div n="lb"/>flesh of boars, horses, fowl and crows in a heap and on
<div n="lb"/>the intestines of animals hanging from ropes sat birds
<div n="lb"/>pecking at them. In the hands of children there were
<div n="lb"/>pieces of raw meat and flies hovered round them. The
<div n="lb"/>hut presented a disgusting atmosphere and yet I
<div n="lb"/>entered and sat on a leaf and my marriage with
<div n="lb"/>Hārakeyūrī was conducted there. The celebrations of
<div n="lb"/>the marriage lasted for seven days and all these days
<div n="lb"/>people danced and shouted amidst loud noises of
<div n="lb"/>drumming in a hilarious mood of drunkenness.
<div n="NI"/>Eight months passed by very soon and Hārakeyūrī
<div n="lb"/>became pregnant. She delivered a girl first and soon
<div n="lb"/>we had two or three children more. I had to do many
<div n="lb"/>cruel and nasty deeds to feed my family and gradually
<div n="lb"/>I became old. My hair became grey.
<div n="NI"/>At that time there occurred a great famine and those
<div n="lb"/>residing in the forests were put to great trouble. There
<div n="lb"/>was no water to drink as all ponds and lakes went
<div n="lb"/>dry. Some of us migrated to the vicinity of the
<div n="lb"/>Vindhya mountain where there were plenty of water-
<div n="lb"/>fountains. A few committed suicide. We also left the
<div n="lb"/>place and started walking, taking the children also
<div n="lb"/>along with us. After some time we sat under a palm
<div n="lb"/>tree completely exhausted. My wife began to weep
<div n="lb"/>profusely. She then kissed her children and lay down
<div n="lb"/>and started sleeping. Thirsty and hungry my children
<div n="lb"/>lay there awaiting death. Unable to witness the scene
<div n="lb"/>I jumped up from there deciding to commit suicide
<div n="lb"/>myself. Suddenly my vision faded and I was able to
<div n="lb"/>see this court and you all. This is the work of that
<div n="lb"/>magician”.
<div n="NI"/>The courtiers sat dumb-founded at the incredible
<div n="lb"/>story of the King. Suddenly the magician disappeared.
<div n="lb"/>The magician after making the King experience the
<div n="lb"/>woes of twelve years in a very short time left for the
<div n="lb"/>court of Indra.
<div n="NI"/>Next morning King Lavaṇa in the hope of seeing the
<div n="lb"/>place and people of his dream in reality near the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Vindhya started with his retinue on the
<div n="lb"/>false pretext that he was going to conduct a victory
<div n="lb"/>march When he entered a big forest he met with many
<div n="lb"/>familiar places and hunters of his dream. Then he saw
<div n="lb"/>the hut where he had lived. The same men and women
<div n="lb"/>were there all around. Then the saw an old lady
<div n="lb"/>lamenting thus: “Oh my dear sons, where did you go
<div n="lb"/>from my lap? My dear daughter, have you forsaken
<div n="lb"/>me? Oh prince, you came here abandoning all luxury
<div n="lb"/>and the beautiful girls of your palace and married
<div n="lb"/>my daughter. But God did not allow even her to be
<div n="lb"/>your permanent wife. The river of life has to take
<div n="lb"/>worthless and mean paths forced by circumstances. A
[Page453-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>very virtuous King had to come and live with a
<div n="lb"/>caṇḍāla girl.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this the King went to her and asked her all de-
<div n="lb"/>tails. When she repeated the story the king knew that the
<div n="lb"/>lady was the mother of his caṇḍāla wife. The King and
<div n="lb"/>ministers were surprised to find that his vision was
<div n="lb"/>real and within that short period of his meditation he
<div n="lb"/>had lived a life of years. This perplexed the King.
<div n="lb"/>He then gave the old lady whatever she wanted and
<div n="lb"/>after consoling her started for the palace thinking
<div n="lb"/>about the wonderful happenings and mysteries of life.
