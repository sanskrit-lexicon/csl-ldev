ANDHA II¦. There is a story in M.B., about a hunts-
man, Vaṭaka killing one Andha, an evil being. Andha
whose form and shape were that of an animal, by do-
ing tapas, became recipient of a boon for destroying
everything. Brahmā rendered him blind lest the world
perish, and that animal began to be known as Andha.
When Andha began his programme of complete destruc-
tion many people rushed up to Viśvāmitra in his abode
in the forest. Andha followed them. But, Viśvāmitra,
in the interests of self-protection pointed out the refu-
gees to Andha. As punishment for this sin Viśvāmitra
had once to go to hell. This story was related by
Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna during the great war at Kurukṣetra,
and the reason for telling the story was this: During
the fight Arjuna hesitated to aim arrows against Karṇa.
Enraged by this attitude of Arjuna Dharmaputra asked
him to hand over his famous bow, Gāṇḍīva to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
Feeling insulted at this demand Arjuna, all on a sud-
den, drew his sword to do away with Dharmaputra.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, prevented Arjuna from attacking his noble
brother, and in this context related the above story to
prove the truth that sins committed even unwittingly
will lead one, as in the case of Viśvāmitra to hell.
(M.B., Karṇa Parva, Chapter 69).
