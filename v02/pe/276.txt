ANDHA II¦. There is a story in M.B., about a hunts-
<div n="lb"/>man, Vaṭaka killing one Andha, an evil being. Andha
<div n="lb"/>whose form and shape were that of an animal, by do-
<div n="lb"/>ing tapas, became recipient of a boon for destroying
<div n="lb"/>everything. Brahmā rendered him blind lest the world
<div n="lb"/>perish, and that animal began to be known as Andha.
<div n="lb"/>When Andha began his programme of complete destruc-
<div n="lb"/>tion many people rushed up to Viśvāmitra in his abode
<div n="lb"/>in the forest. Andha followed them. But, Viśvāmitra,
<div n="lb"/>in the interests of self-protection pointed out the refu-
<div n="lb"/>gees to Andha. As punishment for this sin Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>had once to go to hell. This story was related by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna during the great war at Kurukṣetra,
<div n="lb"/>and the reason for telling the story was this: During
<div n="lb"/>the fight Arjuna hesitated to aim arrows against Karṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Enraged by this attitude of Arjuna Dharmaputra asked
<div n="lb"/>him to hand over his famous bow, Gāṇḍīva to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Feeling insulted at this demand Arjuna, all on a sud-
<div n="lb"/>den, drew his sword to do away with Dharmaputra.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, prevented Arjuna from attacking his noble
<div n="lb"/>brother, and in this context related the above story to
<div n="lb"/>prove the truth that sins committed even unwittingly
<div n="lb"/>will lead one, as in the case of Viśvāmitra to hell.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Karṇa Parva, Chapter 69).
