PAÑCABHŪTA¦. Pṛthvī (earth), Ap (water), Tejas
<div n="lb"/>(fire), Vāyu (air) and Ākāśa (ether) are the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>bhūtas (five elements). The whole visible world is com-
<div n="lb"/>posed of one or more of these five elements. This is
<div n="lb"/>called the Pāñcabhautikasiddhānta (doctrine of five ele-
<div n="lb"/>ments). Besides these five dravyas (elementary subs-
<div n="lb"/>tance), people in Bhārata have reckoned Time, space,
<div n="lb"/>soul and mind also as Padārthas or categories. Dravya,
<div n="lb"/>one of the seven categories according to Nyāya Vaiśeṣika-
<div n="lb"/>sūtras, has nine svabhāvas (inherent properties). The
<div n="lb"/>seven Padārthas of Vaiśeṣika are Dravya, Guṇa, Karman
<div n="lb"/>Sāmānya, Viśeṣa, Samavāya and Abhāva.

<div n="NI"/>The word ‘Padārtha’ has got a very wide meaning. The
<div n="lb"/>word ‘matter’ in English cannot indicate the full signi-
<div n="lb"/>ficance of the word Padārtha. Kaṇāda in his Vaiśeṣika
<div n="lb"/>sūtras has given the name ‘Artha’ combining in it the
<div n="lb"/>three svabhāvas, Dravya, Guṇa and Karman. Of the
<div n="lb"/>above seven padārthas Praśastapāda, the famous logic-
<div n="lb"/>ian, has included only the first six in his book
<div n="lb"/>‘Padārthadharma Saṃgraha’. The Vaiśeṣikas of a later
<div n="lb"/>period included ‘abhāva’ also and raised the number
<div n="lb"/>of arthas to seven. Gautama, the Nyāyasūtrakāra and
<div n="lb"/>Vātsyāyana, the Nyāyabhāṣyakāra, and all their followers
<div n="lb"/>accepted the number of arthas as seven.
<div n="NI"/>All that can be perceived by the senses are includ-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the seven Padārthas according to the sys-
<div n="lb"/>tems of Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika. Excepting abhāva all the
<div n="lb"/>other six are bhāvas. Kaṇāda has dealt with ‘abhāva’
<div n="lb"/>but has not treated it as a category. Praśastapāda has not
<div n="lb"/>mentioned about ‘abhāva’ at all. Gautama deals with six-
<div n="lb"/>teen Padārthas. The Mīmāṃsakas take into account only
<div n="lb"/>five Padārthas and the Sāṅkhyas count only two
<div n="lb"/>Padārthas viz., Prakṛti and Puruṣa. Advaitavādins re-
<div n="lb"/>ckon only two Padārthas and to them they are Cit and
<div n="lb"/>Jaḍa (Ātmā and Anātman). Viśiṣṭādvaitins add god
<div n="lb"/>also to the above and make the number of Padārthas
<div n="lb"/>three.

<div n="lb"/>According to Nyāya Vaiśeṣikasūtras there are seven
<div n="lb"/>Padārthas and they comprise nine kinds of Dravyas which
<div n="lb"/>are the Pañcabhūtas (five elements), Kāla (time), Dik
<div n="lb"/>(space), Ātmā (soul), and Manas (mind). They are
<div n="lb"/>described below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Pṛthvī. (earth).%} The characteristic of this padārtha
<div n="lb"/>is smell. Pṛthvī is of two kinds, Nitya (eternal) and
<div n="lb"/>Anitya (perishable). Nitya is in the form of atom
<div n="lb"/>(paramāṇu) and anitya in the form of Kārya. They
<div n="lb"/>are classified into body, sense organs and objects.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jala (water).%} Jala has a cold touch. It is of two
<div n="lb"/>kinds Nitya and Anitya. Nitya is in the form of paramāṇu
<div n="lb"/>(atom); Anitya in the form of Kārya.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Agni (fire).%} It generates heat. It is of two kinds,
<div n="lb"/>Nitya and Anitya. Nitya is in the form of paramāṇu
<div n="lb"/>and Anitya, in the form of Kārya. There are four kinds
<div n="lb"/>of Agnis: Fire of the earth, fire of the sky, fire of the
<div n="lb"/>stomach (digestive power) and the fire commonly used.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Vāyu (air).%} It is without form but with the sense
<div n="lb"/>of touch. It is also of two kinds. Nitya in the form of
<div n="lb"/>paramāṇu and Anitya in the form of Kārya.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ākāśa (ether).%} This is the carrier of sound. It is
<div n="lb"/>single and eternal.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kāla (time).%} It is general cause for all actions em-
<div n="lb"/>bracing the elements. It is also single and eternal.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Dik.%} Places like north, south, east and west which
<div n="lb"/>are eternal.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Ātmā (soul).%} It is related to knowledge and is of
<div n="lb"/>two kinds, Jīvātmā and Paramātmā.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Manas (mind).%} It is the sense-organ to enjoy
<div n="lb"/>pleasures. It is in the form of paramāṇu and eternal.
<div n="NI"/>To know the views of Manu on the origin of the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>bhūtas see under Sṛṣṭi.
