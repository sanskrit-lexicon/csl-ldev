BALI V¦. A famous monkey-king of the country of Ānava.
This King who was the son of Sutapas was a contem-
porary of the great King Sagara.
<div n="NI"/>Bali did penance and Brahmā appeared before him,
and blessed him and said, “You will become a great
sage and will live till the end of the Kalpa (a period
of world age). Your power will be inimitable. Nobody
will overthrow you in battle. You will be loved by
your subjects and they will obey you. You will be well-
versed in the knowledge of law and its observance and
the learned will recognize your knowledge. You will
re-establish caste system in your kingdom.” (Harivaṃśa,
1. 31.35.39).
<div n="NI"/>Sudeṣṇā was the wife of Bali. The couple had no children.
At last they appealed to Dīrghatamas a hermit, from
whom they got five sons called Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga,
Pāṇḍu and Suhma (Brahma Purāṇa). In Bhāgavata
it is mentioned that he had one more son called
Andhra.
<div n="NI"/>Bali left his body at the end of the Kalpa and entered
heaven. Before his death he had divided his kingdom
equally among his sons. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 92).
