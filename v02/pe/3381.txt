KĀŚĪ I¦. (VĀRĀṆASĪ. BANARAS). (See under Divo-
dāsa also).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} One of the oldest and most popular
sacred centres in India, Kāśī is reputed for its Viśva-
nātha temple of hoary traditions, according to one of
which the Śivaliṅga in the temple was installed by
Brahmā himself. (Hālāsya Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pilgrimage on foot to Kāśī.%} Devotees from many
parts of India go on pilgrimage to Kāśī on foot, bathe
in the holy waters of the Gaṅgā and thus earn spiritual
satisfaction and release from worldly attachments. The
reason for the above is stated in the Agni Purāṇa as
follows:— Once, at Kailāsa Śiva told Pārvatī that the
temple at Kāśī was called ‘Avimukta’ (unreleased) as
it never perished, and all Japa, tapa, homa and dāna
made there never cease to give auspicious results. One
should walk on foot to Kāśī and live there. Having
gone there one should never leave the place. There are
eight great tīrthas at Avimukta, i.e. Hariścandra tīrtha,
Āvrātakeśvara tīrtha, Japyeśvara tīrtha, Śrī Parva-
tīrtha, Mahālayatīrtha, Bhṛgu tīrtha, Caṇḍeśvara
tīrtha and Kedāratīrtha. These tīrthas extend to two
yojanas to the east of the Kāśī temple and half-a-
yojana to the west of it. The river Varaṇā is also there,
and Vārāṇasī is at the centre of all these. Whatever is
done at Vārāṇasī like bath, Japa, homa, worship of
Devas, dāna, obsequies for the dead, oneself living there
etc. is productive of devotion and salvation. (Agni
Purāṇa, Chapter 112).
