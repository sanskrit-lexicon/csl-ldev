ADHIRATHA¦. Foster father of Karṇa.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Foster father of Karṇa.%} Sage Durvāsas had taught
<div n="lb"/>Kuntī some mantras to get children, and Kuntī, then
<div n="lb"/>unmarried, tested the first mantra with the Sun-god
<div n="lb"/>as her object. The Sun-god appeared before Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>and from his power she conceived and duly delivered a
<div n="lb"/>child, Karṇa. Fearing obloquy Kuntī concealed the
<div n="lb"/>child in a box and floated it on the river, Ganges. At the
<div n="lb"/>time Adhiratha, a great comrade of Dhṛtarāṣṭra came
<div n="lb"/>to the river for a bath. His wife was one grieving
<div n="lb"/>over not having a child of her own. So, when Adhiratha
<div n="lb"/>found a child in the floating box, he took it home,
<div n="lb"/>and himself and his wife Rādhā brought up the child
<div n="lb"/>with pleasure. The child was named Vasusena, and
<div n="lb"/>the child grew up to become the famous Karṇa and
<div n="lb"/>favourite friend of Duryodhana. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 67 and 130; Vana Parva, Chapter 309;
<div n="lb"/>Devībhāgavata, Skandha 2).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Some particulars.%} Adhiratha was King of Aṅga. He
<div n="lb"/>was a Sūta (charioteer) and Karṇa grew up as his
<div n="lb"/>son. Karṇa was sent to Hastināpura to be trained
<div n="lb"/>in the uṣe of weapons, and it was here that Duryo-
<div n="lb"/>dhana and Karṇa developed their friendship and
<div n="lb"/>alliance. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 147, Verse 3).
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Mahādevībhāgavata, in Chapter 3 relates the
<div n="lb"/>following incident: “Thus lamenting Kuntī sent the
<div n="lb"/>box concealing Karṇa, by the nurse, to be floated in
<div n="lb"/>the river, and after bath, food etc. she spent the hours
<div n="lb"/>in the normal way within the inner apartment. Rājā
<div n="lb"/>Adhiratha bathing in the river saw the box floating in
<div n="lb"/>the river”. These facts prove that Adhiratha was not
<div n="lb"/>only the King of Aṅga but a good charioteer as well,
<div n="lb"/>and further a very good friend of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="NI"/>4) We come across Adhiratha on the occasion of the
<div n="lb"/>trial of skill in the use of arms between the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>and the Pāṇḍavas. When Karṇa entered the lists
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas questioned his nobility of birth. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa's great humiliation and discomfiture Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>enthroned him immediately as King of Aṅga. Vyāsa,
<div n="lb"/>who witnessed the scene has given a picturesque des-
<div n="lb"/>cription of it.
