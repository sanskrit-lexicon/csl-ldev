<div n="NI"/>2) {%Foster father of Karṇa.%} Sage Durvāsas had taught
Kuntī some mantras to get children, and Kuntī, then
unmarried, tested the first mantra with the Sun-god
as her object. The Sun-god appeared before Kuntī
and from his power she conceived and duly delivered a
child, Karṇa. Fearing obloquy Kuntī concealed the
child in a box and floated it on the river, Ganges. At the
time Adhiratha, a great comrade of Dhṛtarāṣṭra came
to the river for a bath. His wife was one grieving
over not having a child of her own. So, when Adhiratha
found a child in the floating box, he took it home,
and himself and his wife Rādhā brought up the child
with pleasure. The child was named Vasusena, and
the child grew up to become the famous Karṇa and
favourite friend of Duryodhana. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapters 67 and 130; Vana Parva, Chapter 309;
Devībhāgavata, Skandha 2).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Some particulars.%} Adhiratha was King of Aṅga. He
was a Sūta (charioteer) and Karṇa grew up as his
son. Karṇa was sent to Hastināpura to be trained
in the uṣe of weapons, and it was here that Duryo-
dhana and Karṇa developed their friendship and
alliance. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 147, Verse 3).
Śrī Mahādevībhāgavata, in Chapter 3 relates the
following incident: “Thus lamenting Kuntī sent the
box concealing Karṇa, by the nurse, to be floated in
the river, and after bath, food etc. she spent the hours
in the normal way within the inner apartment. Rājā
Adhiratha bathing in the river saw the box floating in
the river”. These facts prove that Adhiratha was not
only the King of Aṅga but a good charioteer as well,
and further a very good friend of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="NI"/>4) We come across Adhiratha on the occasion of the
trial of skill in the use of arms between the Kauravas
and the Pāṇḍavas. When Karṇa entered the lists
the Pāṇḍavas questioned his nobility of birth. Seeing
Karṇa's great humiliation and discomfiture Duryodhana
enthroned him immediately as King of Aṅga. Vyāsa,
who witnessed the scene has given a picturesque des-
cription of it.
