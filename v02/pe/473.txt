ASAMAÑJASA¦ (ASAMAÑJA). A King of the Solar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty born to Sagara. For genealogy see under
<div n="lb"/>SAGARA.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} There is a story about his birth in the Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa. Once there was a king called Sagara in Ayodhyā.
<div n="lb"/>He married two women named Keśinī and Sumati. For
[Page057-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>a long time they had no sons and so they went to the
<div n="lb"/>Himālayas and started penance there in the mount of
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛguprasravaṇa. After a hundred years Bhṛgumaha-
<div n="lb"/>rṣi appeared before them and pleased them thus: “Your
<div n="lb"/>elder wife Keśinī will give birth to a son who will
<div n="lb"/>continue your dynasty and your second wife will give
<div n="lb"/>birth to sixty thousand children”. After a few years
<div n="lb"/>Keśinī gave birth to Asamañjas and Sumati to a big
<div n="lb"/>ball of flesh. That ball broke and sixty thousand babes
<div n="lb"/>came out from it. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 83).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Character of Asamañjas.%} He was a very cruel man
<div n="lb"/>always tormenting people. He used to throw little child-
<div n="lb"/>ren into the Sarayū river and stand on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>river enjoying the sight of the children dying drowning.
<div n="lb"/>People hated him. His father, therefore, drove him out
<div n="lb"/>of his palace. To this bad man was born Aṃśumān, a
<div n="lb"/>King who became the favourite of the people. (Vāl-
<div n="lb"/>mīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 38).
