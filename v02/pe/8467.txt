VĪRYAŚULKA¦. In ancient days the Kings wanted to
<div n="lb"/>give their daughters in marriage to the most valiant
<div n="lb"/>youths. The custom of showing their valour before the
<div n="lb"/>people, before getting the damsel became more preval-
<div n="lb"/>ent, than giving money to get the girl. Thus marrying
<div n="lb"/>a girl by showing his valour is called Marriage by
<div n="lb"/>giving Vīryaśulka. (Śulka means Nuptial gift). (Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 4).
