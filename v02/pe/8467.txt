VĪRYAŚULKA¦. In ancient days the Kings wanted to
give their daughters in marriage to the most valiant
youths. The custom of showing their valour before the
people, before getting the damsel became more preval-
ent, than giving money to get the girl. Thus marrying
a girl by showing his valour is called Marriage by
giving Vīryaśulka. (Śulka means Nuptial gift). (Agni
Purāṇa, Chapter 4).
