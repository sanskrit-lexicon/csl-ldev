CANDRAŚRĪ¦. A woman, who, though actually in love
<div n="lb"/>with her husband enjoyed life with her paramour.
<div n="lb"/>Candraśrī is the heroine of a story narrated in the Kathā-
<div n="lb"/>saritsāgara to prove that the interest married women take
<div n="lb"/>in clandestine relationship is only due to fleeting temp-
<div n="lb"/>tations. Candraśrī was the wife of a vaiśya called Bāla-
<div n="lb"/>varman, who lived in the city of Pratiṣṭhāna. One day,
<div n="lb"/>looking out through the windows in her house she saw
<div n="lb"/>the very handsome vaiśya youth called Śīlahāra and
<div n="lb"/>felt great desire for him. She brought him secretly to
<div n="lb"/>the house of her companion and satisfied her desire.
<div n="lb"/>When their meeting became a routine affair her relations
<div n="lb"/>and servants knew about it. And, her husband alone was
<div n="lb"/>unaware of it. Once he became ill with severe fever.
<div n="lb"/>Even while he was in his death-bed Candraśrī continued
<div n="lb"/>her affair with the paramour. When one day she was
<div n="lb"/>with her paramour thus, she was told that her husband
<div n="lb"/>was no more. At once she took leave of him, returned
<div n="lb"/>home and committed suicide by jumping into the funeral
<div n="lb"/>pyre of the husband. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Śaktiyaśolam-
<div n="lb"/>baka, Taraṅga 2).
