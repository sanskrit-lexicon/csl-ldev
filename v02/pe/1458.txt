CANDRAŚRĪ¦. A woman, who, though actually in love
with her husband enjoyed life with her paramour.
Candraśrī is the heroine of a story narrated in the Kathā-
saritsāgara to prove that the interest married women take
in clandestine relationship is only due to fleeting temp-
tations. Candraśrī was the wife of a vaiśya called Bāla-
varman, who lived in the city of Pratiṣṭhāna. One day,
looking out through the windows in her house she saw
the very handsome vaiśya youth called Śīlahāra and
felt great desire for him. She brought him secretly to
the house of her companion and satisfied her desire.
When their meeting became a routine affair her relations
and servants knew about it. And, her husband alone was
unaware of it. Once he became ill with severe fever.
Even while he was in his death-bed Candraśrī continued
her affair with the paramour. When one day she was
with her paramour thus, she was told that her husband
was no more. At once she took leave of him, returned
home and committed suicide by jumping into the funeral
pyre of the husband. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Śaktiyaśolam-
baka, Taraṅga 2).
