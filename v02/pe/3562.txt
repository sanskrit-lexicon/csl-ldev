KĪRTIMUKHA¦. A Śiva gaṇa born out of the matted
<div n="lb"/>hair of Śiva with three faces, three tails, three legs and
<div n="lb"/>seven hands. The Lord at first asked him to live on
<div n="lb"/>corpses, but later on, in appreciation of his valour
<div n="lb"/>granted him the boon that if anyone saw the Lord
<div n="lb"/>without thinking first about Kīrtimukha, he would
<div n="lb"/>meet with his down-fall. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa, Chapter 50).
