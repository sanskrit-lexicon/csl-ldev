KARṆAPRĀVARAṆA¦(S). An ancient tribe of people
who inhabited the shores of the sea in the south. The
one distinctive feature of this tribe was that their ears
were extraordinarily long, drooping down to the feet.
Sahadeva conquered and subdued this tribe. (Śloka
67, Chapter 31, Sabhā Parva). They once brought to
Yudhiṣṭhira many valuable presents and paid their
respects to him. (Śloka 19, Chapter 52, Sabhā Parva).
