<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Daśaratha was the son of Aja, of the family
of Ikṣvāku, born of his wife Indumatī.
<F>1) It is stated in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 274, Stanza 6 that ‘Ilabilā, was the name of the mother of Daśaratha.</F>
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Daśaratha's hunt.%} Once during the early part of his
life Daśaratha was walking through a forest engaged in
hunting. He reached the bank of the river Sarayū.
It was evening and the forest was thick. He walked in
search of wild animals. The night was advancing and
darkness getting thicker. Then he heard a sound from
the river as if an elephant was drinking water. Thinking
it to be an elephant Daśaratha sent an arrow in the
direction from which the sound came. Instantly he heard
a man crying with pain. The king was disappointed.
He ran to the spot and saw a hermit boy lying in a pool
of blood beating his limbs on the ground and crying.
The waterpot he had been dipping in the water lay
close by. In answer to the questions of the King, the
[Page204-a+ 65]
hermit boy whose name was Śravaṇa,
<F>1. In Agnipurāṇa Chapter 6, it is stated that the name of this hermit boy was Yajñadatta.</F> said, “Oh
King! What wrong have I done? My parents are
sitting thirsty and blind with age, in the hermitage close-
by. I, their only son, was dipping the pot to take water
to them, when you sent the arrow at me. So, please take
some water to them in this pot and console them.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this, with tears the King drew out the fatal
arrow from the body of the boy and with that the boy
Śravaṇa said good bye to the world. Daśaratha took
water in the pot and went in search of the hermitage in
the darkness. With difficulty he found out the hermitage
and as he drew near, the aged parents of the boy heard
his footsteps and called him eagerly. The King, with
tearful eyes told them what had happened. There was
loud wailing and crying in the hermitage. According to
their wish the King took them to where their son lay.
Then the King made a fire and placed the dead body
of the boy in it. The aged and blind parents cursed
Daśaratha, “You also will die of loss of children”.
Then they also entered the fire and were burnt along
with their son's dead body. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayo-
dhyā Kāṇḍa, Sarga 63).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage.%} Daśaratha had three wives, named
Kauśalyā, Kaikeyī and Sumitrā.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaikeyī given a boon.%} There was a great battle in the
world of the gods between the asuras and the gods.
According to the request of the devas, Daśaratha went to
the world of the devas to help them. Kaikeyī also went
with Daśaratha. In a severe fight with Śambara, an
asura, Daśaratha fell down unconscious. Kaikeyī took
him away from the battle-field. When he recovered the
King got into the chariot and fought more fiercely than
before. This time the wheel-bolt of one of the wheels of
the chariot of Daśaratha slipped away. Without inform-
ing her husband of this danger, Kaikeyī inserted her
finger into the bolt-hole and prevented the wheel from
sliding away. The King won the battle. After the battle,
when the King came to know of the services rendered
by Kaikeyī, he promised her two boons. Kaikeyī told
the King that she would ask for them later, when she
needed them. Then they returned to Ayodhyā. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Sarga 9, Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Administration of Daśaratha.%} The capital of Daśa-
ratha's kingdom of Kosala, was Ayodhyā. This city was
situated on the bank of river Sarayū. Daśaratha was as
famous in Ayodhyā as Indra was in the realm of the
gods. There were palaces in Ayodhyā for the kings who
brought tribute to stay. In short, as mentioned in
Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 5, Ayodhyā was
the heaven on earth.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Ministers.%} Daśaratha had eight ministers, Sṛṣṭi,
Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhārtha, Rāṣṭravardhana, Aśoka,
Dharmapāla, and Sumantra. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The name Daśaratha.%} The real name of Daśaratha
was Nemi. Once the unattackable and invincible asura
Śaṃbara conquered the throne of Indra. At the request
of Brahmā and the gods, this King reached heaven and
destroyed the armies of the asuras very easily. Śaṃbara
got angry, assumed ten shapes and attacked the King
from ten points at the same time. The king confronted
the ten Śaṃbaras at ten points, at the same time, and
killed all of them at the same moment. Because he
faced his chariot to ten points at the same time and
fought with enemies on those ten points Brahmā appre-
[Page204-b+ 64]
ciated his valiant fighting and charioteering and gave
him the name ‘Daśaratha’ (one who is capable of driving
the chariot to ten points at the same time). Thus his
original name was forgotten and he came to be known
only by the name given him later. (Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Birth of Sons.%} Kausalyā was the first wife of Daśa-
ratha. She was the daughter of the King of Uttara
Kosala. A daughter named Śāntā was born to Daśaratha
by Kausalyā. After this, no sons or daughters were born
to Daśaratha for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>At this juncture Lomapāda, the king of Aṅga who was the
class-mate and a great friend of Daśaratha, came to
Ayodhyā on a friendly visit. He also had no children.
So he entreated Daśaratha to give Śāntā to him as a
foster-daughter. Thus he took away Śāntā to Aṅga.
Lomapāda gave Śāntā in marriage to Ṛṣyaṣṛṅga a
hermit. (See under Ṛṣyaśṛṅga).
<div n="NI"/>As Kausalyā was childless Daśaratha brought as his
wife Kaikeyī the daughter of the King of Kekaya and
sister of Yudhājit. Still no children were born to them.
He was much disappointed. At last he married again and
brought Sumitrā the princess of Kāśi. Of these three,
Kausalyā was the chief wife.
<div n="NI"/>Though he had three wives, Daśaratha still remained
childless. The King and his queens spent their days in
sorrow for a long time. The King remembered the curse
he had incurred when he was young. The curse was
that as they had died with sorrow at the death of their
son Śravaṇa, the same thing would happen to me.
So he believed that sons would be born to him.
<div n="NI"/>He performed several devotional acts to get children.
Finally he gave up all kingly pleasures and began to
lead an ascetic life. He built a temple for his own use
and consecrated the idol of Mahāviṣṇu in it. Then entrust-
ing the administration of the Kingdom to his ministers
he and his wives engaged themselves in daily devotion
and meditation in the temple. Then the King decided
to perform the sacrifice of Putrakāmeṣṭi (sacrifice for
getting children) by the hermit Ṛṣyaśṛṅga under the
guidance of Vasiṣṭha. The King informed Ṛṣyaśṛṅga
of his decision. Ṛṣyaśṛṅga could not refuse the King's
request as the king was his father-in-law. Moreover
Lomapāda and Śāntā also requested the hermit to com-
ply with the desire of Daśaratha. So Ṛṣyaśṛṅga came to
Ayodhyā and the sacrifice of Putrakāmeṣṭi was begun.
The air vibrated with the recitation of mantras (spells and
incantations) and the Veda Sūktas. The hermit uttered
the divine spell of Putrakāmeṣṭi and offered oblations
in the sacrificial fire. Then a wonderful and luminous
figure came out of the fire with a pot containing a
pudding of ambrosia, and placed the pot before Ṛṣya-
ṣṛṅga and then disappeared in the sacrificial fire. When
the wonderful figure disappeared, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga took the
pot of pudding and gave it to Daśaratha with prayer and
incantations. Daśaratha received the golden pot and in
accordance with the instruction of the hermit, divided
the pudding between his first wife Kauśalyā and second
wife Kaikeyī, both of whom gave half of their share to
Sumitrā. Thus the three wives ate the divine pudding
and by and by all of them became pregnant. Kauśalyā
and Kaikeyī gave birth to a son each and Sumitrā
gave birth to two sons. The son of Kauśalyā was called
Rāma, the son of Kaikeyī was named Bharata and the
[Page205-a+ 65]
sons of Sumitrā were called Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna.
(Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The boon of Śani (Saturn).%} Astronomers are of
opinion that famine will occur in the world for the
period of twelve years, when the planet Śani (Saturn)
comes into the orbit of Rohiṇī (a star). But now the
planet Saturn does not come into the orbit of the star
Rohiṇī. There is a story in the Padma Purāṇa, which
states that this happened so because of a boon Śani had
given to Daśaratha.
<div n="NI"/>During the regime of Daśaratha the planet Śani approa-
ched the orbit of Rohiṇī. Experts in astronomy said that
the earth would be ruined by famine etc. if Śani cleft
the star Rohiṇī. Hearing this Daśaratha took his bow
and arrows, got into his chariot, and started for the
firmament. He travelled for one lac and a quarter of
yojanas (leagues) and reached the hind part of Rohiṇī,
which is beyond the sun. Adorned with golden gar-
ments and a golden crown studded with jewels, seated
on a golden chariot decorated with precious stones, and a
lofty flagpost and yoked with horses of the colour of
swan, the king shone in the sky as a second sun. He drew
the bow-string right upto his ear and placed in it the
arrow of destruction. When the devas and the asuras
saw the arrow of destruction they began to tremble with
fear. Śani came to Daśaratha and fell before him and
said that he would grant any boon to the King, and
requested him to recall the arrow of destruction. Daśa-
ratha told Śani that he only wanted Śani not to come to
the orbit of Rohiṇī. Śani agreed. From that day onwards
Śani has never entered the orbit of Rohiṇī. (Padma
Purāṇa, Uttara Kānḍa, Chapter 34).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Death.%} Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa with Sītā went to
live in the forest. Sumantra who accompanied them
up to the river Ganges, returned to the palace. By
then Daśaratha had fallen down filled with grief. He
had never recovered from that state of unconsciousness.
At the time of his death Bharata and Śatrughna had
been away in the kingdom of Kekaya and Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa in the forest. Thus the curse he incurred
in his younger days from the aged hermit, the father of
Śravaṇa, was fully realized.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Daśaratha appears again.%} Rāvaṇa was killed in the
battle. Sītā was tested in fire and found sinless. Rāma
accepted her, seeing that her conjugal fidelity was not
marred. At this time Śiva appeared before Rāma in a
divine aeroplane. Daśaratha was seated in that plane
clad in pure garments. He took Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
into his lap and embraced them. He blessed them and
Sītā who was standing with folded hands. Then Daśa-
ratha disappeared. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa,
Sarga 122).
