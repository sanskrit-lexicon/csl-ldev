EKĀDAŚĪ¦. The eleventh day after a new moon or full
<div n="lb"/>moon day. The vrata observed on this day is called
<div n="lb"/>the Ekādaśī vrata. King Ambarīṣa observed very
<div n="lb"/>strictly and continuously the Ekādaśī Vrata to obtain
<div n="lb"/>the status of Indra. (See under Ambarīṣa). (Navama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Bhāgavata). This vrata would fetch food
<div n="lb"/>for the hungry and salvation for those who are in
<div n="lb"/>search of it. (Agni Purāṇa). The method of observing
<div n="lb"/>this vrata is detailed below:
<div n="NI"/>Those who observe the Ekādaśī vrata should be on a
<div n="lb"/>regulated diet excluding meat and avoid sexual acts
<div n="lb"/>on the Daśamī day, the day preceding Ekādaśī. On
<div n="lb"/>both the Ekādaśī days in a month one should not take
<div n="lb"/>any food at all. The period which combines Ekādaśī
<div n="lb"/>with Dvādaśī (the twelfth day) is called Harivāsara
<div n="lb"/>because of the presence of Viṣṇu at that time. That
<div n="lb"/>is a good time for doing sacred yajñas. That day where
<div n="lb"/>there is only a small portion of Ekādaśī and the rest
<div n="lb"/>Dvādasī is the best day for yajñas. Trayodaśī (the
<div n="lb"/>thirteenth day) is good for breaking the fast. The day
<div n="lb"/>which merges Dvādaśī into Trayodaśī is the best day
<div n="lb"/>for breaking the fast. Do not observe the Vrata on a
<div n="lb"/>day which combines Daśamī with Ekādaśī. Hell is the
<div n="lb"/>result if one does so.
<div n="NI"/>Completely abstaining from food on the Ekādaśī day
<div n="lb"/>you should take food on the Dvādaśī day. As you take
<div n="lb"/>your food you should pray like this: “Bhuṅkṣyehaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍarīkākṣa śaraṇaṃ me bhavācyuta”. (Oh, Puṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>rīkākṣa, I am going to break my fast. Oh, Bhagavan,
<div n="lb"/>let you be my heaven). If an Ekādaśī comes on a
<div n="lb"/>Pūyaṃ—Puṣya—day in the bright half of the month that
<div n="lb"/>day should on any account be observed. That day would
<div n="lb"/>give the observer unlimited good result and that
<div n="lb"/>Ekādaśī is qualified as Pāpanāśinī (destroyer of all
<div n="lb"/>evils). When Ekādaśī and Dvādaśī happen to combine
<div n="lb"/>on a Tiruvoṇam (Śrāvaṇa) day the Ekādaśī is qualified
<div n="lb"/>as Vijayā. That day gives prosperity to devotees. It is
<div n="lb"/>also called Vijayā if an Ekādaśī comes in the month
<div n="lb"/>of Phālguna (March) on a Pūyaṃ (Puṣya) day. The
<div n="lb"/>wise extol this day as one promising crores of good effects.
<div n="lb"/>On the Ekādaśī day you should do Viṣṇu Pūjā which
<div n="lb"/>is productive of universal happiness. He who does so
<div n="lb"/>will acquire children and wealth in this world and
<div n="lb"/>attain Viṣṇuloka on death. (Chapter 178, Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa)
