SUPRABHĀ VI¦. Daughter of King Suratha and wife of
Nābhāga. Sage Agastya who became displeased with
her as she once threatened him, cursed her to be born
in Vaiśya caste as a result of which Suprabhā and her son
Bhalandana became Vaiśyas. But, as Suprabhā taught
her son, when he came of age, about the duties of the
Kṣatriya he regained his former form. (Mārkaṇḍeya
Purāṇa).
