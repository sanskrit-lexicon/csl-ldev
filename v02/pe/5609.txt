RĀJA¦ (N). All the important Purāṇas have laid special
emphasis on the importance of rule by Kings. All living
beings will have Kings of their own. It was Brahmā
who first assigned or ordained Kingship. After the
creation of the Prajāpatis, Brahmā made Candra the
King of the stars and medicines; Varuṇa was appointed
King of waters like sea, river etc; Vaiśravaṇa was
appointed King of Kings; Viṣṇu, King of Devas; Agni,
King of Vasus; Indra King of Maruts; Dakṣa King of
the Prajāpatis; Prahlāda King of the dānavas; Hima-
vān, King of mountains; Citraratha, King of Gandhar-
vas; Vāsuki, King of nāgas; Garuḍa, King of birds;
Airāvata, King of elephants; Ox, King of cattle, Tiger,
King of animals, Peepal tree, King of trees and
Uccaiśśravas that of horses. (Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>As to what type the King of man-kind should be and
what should form his duties it is ordained as follows. The
Rājā should appoint either a Kṣatriya or a brahmin as
his Commander-in-chief. The Commander-in-chief
should be of noble birth and well-versed in law. Only
a strong man who can speak boldly and openly should
be appointed emissary or ambassador. Either a male
or a female may be appointed to carry chewing mate-
rials. But, that person should be loyal, friendly and
capable of putting up with hardships. The body-guard
of the King should be a good swords-man. Ministers
should be conversant with dharmaśāstras (moral and
ethical codes).
<div n="NI"/>Also, the King should be surrounded by the royal
physician, chief of the elephant division of the army,
the mahout, chief of the cavalry force, master of the
forts, the architect, preceptor in archery and the chief
of the internal administration of the palace.
<div n="NI"/>When it is yet three hours for the dawn, the King
should wake up from sleep. Music, praises by courtiers
etc. should herald his waking up. As soon as he has
woken up, the King should hold talks with his spies.
Then he should examine accounts and only after this
should he begin the ablutions. After his pūjā (worship)
is over, cows with gold should be gifted to brahmins.
With their blessings he must look first into the mirror
and then in ghee along with gold. Then he must look
up the almanac for the day's star etc. And after having
taken the medicine prescribed by the physician and

also the blessings of the preceptor the King should
attend court. (Agni Purāṇa. Chapter 235).
<div n="NI"/>According to Chapter 8 of the Manusmṛti (a great
authority on law and ethics) Kings are born from the
shoulders of Indra, Vāyu, Yama, Sūrya, Agni, Varuṇa,
Candra and Kubera.
