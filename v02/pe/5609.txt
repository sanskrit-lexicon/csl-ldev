RĀJA¦ (N). All the important Purāṇas have laid special
<div n="lb"/>emphasis on the importance of rule by Kings. All living
<div n="lb"/>beings will have Kings of their own. It was Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>who first assigned or ordained Kingship. After the
<div n="lb"/>creation of the Prajāpatis, Brahmā made Candra the
<div n="lb"/>King of the stars and medicines; Varuṇa was appointed
<div n="lb"/>King of waters like sea, river etc; Vaiśravaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>appointed King of Kings; Viṣṇu, King of Devas; Agni,
<div n="lb"/>King of Vasus; Indra King of Maruts; Dakṣa King of
<div n="lb"/>the Prajāpatis; Prahlāda King of the dānavas; Hima-
<div n="lb"/>vān, King of mountains; Citraratha, King of Gandhar-
<div n="lb"/>vas; Vāsuki, King of nāgas; Garuḍa, King of birds;
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata, King of elephants; Ox, King of cattle, Tiger,
<div n="lb"/>King of animals, Peepal tree, King of trees and
<div n="lb"/>Uccaiśśravas that of horses. (Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>As to what type the King of man-kind should be and
<div n="lb"/>what should form his duties it is ordained as follows. The
<div n="lb"/>Rājā should appoint either a Kṣatriya or a brahmin as
<div n="lb"/>his Commander-in-chief. The Commander-in-chief
<div n="lb"/>should be of noble birth and well-versed in law. Only
<div n="lb"/>a strong man who can speak boldly and openly should
<div n="lb"/>be appointed emissary or ambassador. Either a male
<div n="lb"/>or a female may be appointed to carry chewing mate-
<div n="lb"/>rials. But, that person should be loyal, friendly and
<div n="lb"/>capable of putting up with hardships. The body-guard
<div n="lb"/>of the King should be a good swords-man. Ministers
<div n="lb"/>should be conversant with dharmaśāstras (moral and
<div n="lb"/>ethical codes).
<div n="NI"/>Also, the King should be surrounded by the royal
<div n="lb"/>physician, chief of the elephant division of the army,
<div n="lb"/>the mahout, chief of the cavalry force, master of the
<div n="lb"/>forts, the architect, preceptor in archery and the chief
<div n="lb"/>of the internal administration of the palace.
<div n="NI"/>When it is yet three hours for the dawn, the King
<div n="lb"/>should wake up from sleep. Music, praises by courtiers
<div n="lb"/>etc. should herald his waking up. As soon as he has
<div n="lb"/>woken up, the King should hold talks with his spies.
<div n="lb"/>Then he should examine accounts and only after this
<div n="lb"/>should he begin the ablutions. After his pūjā (worship)
<div n="lb"/>is over, cows with gold should be gifted to brahmins.
<div n="lb"/>With their blessings he must look first into the mirror
<div n="lb"/>and then in ghee along with gold. Then he must look
<div n="lb"/>up the almanac for the day's star etc. And after having
<div n="lb"/>taken the medicine prescribed by the physician and

<div n="lb"/>also the blessings of the preceptor the King should
<div n="lb"/>attend court. (Agni Purāṇa. Chapter 235).
<div n="NI"/>According to Chapter 8 of the Manusmṛti (a great
<div n="lb"/>authority on law and ethics) Kings are born from the
<div n="lb"/>shoulders of Indra, Vāyu, Yama, Sūrya, Agni, Varuṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Candra and Kubera.
