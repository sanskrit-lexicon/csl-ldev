DEVĀSURAYUDDHA¦(S) Wars between the gods and
<div n="lb"/>asuras. Altogether twelve wars were fought between
<div n="lb"/>the Devas and the asuras, viz. Narasiṃha, Vāmana,
<div n="lb"/>Varāha, Amṛtamathana, Tārakāmaya, Āḍībaka, Trai-
<div n="lb"/>pura, Andhaka, Vadha, Vṛtravadha, Dhvajapāta,
<div n="lb"/>Hālāhala and Kolāhala. Hiraṇyakaśipu, the daitya
<div n="lb"/>was killed by Narasiṃha. Vāmana took Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>captive after measuring the three worlds in one stride.
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa was killed in fighting in the sea by Varāha
<div n="lb"/>with its tusks. Indra defeated Prahlāda and in the
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāmaya war also killed his son Virocana who had
<div n="lb"/>planned to kill him (Indra). As the Devas could not
<div n="lb"/>kill the dānavas of Tripura, Trilocana killed them.
<div n="lb"/>Vṛtra who was aided by the dānavas was killed by
<div n="lb"/>Indra with the help of Viṣṇu. Indra himself killed
<div n="lb"/>Vipracitti and his followers who became invisible by
<div n="lb"/>māyā after the felling of the dhvaja (flag staff), and in
<div n="lb"/>the course of celebrating their victory the Devas defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed Śaṇḍāmarka at the yajñāvabhṛtha (Bathing at the
<div n="lb"/>close of the yajña). Thus were waged twelve wars
<div n="lb"/>between the Devas and the Asuras. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Part 4, Chapter 13).
