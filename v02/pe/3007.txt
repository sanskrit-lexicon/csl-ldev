JĪVĀTMAN¦ {%(The individual life or soul).%} The Apara-
<div n="lb"/>brahman (which is next to the highest Brahman) that
<div n="lb"/>is so minute and subtle is called Jīvātman. Parabrahman
<div n="lb"/>is God almighty. It is mentioned in Taittirīyopaniṣad
<div n="lb"/>about this aparabrahman as follows :
<div n="NI"/>“Tasmād vā etasmādātmana ākāśaḥ sambhūtaḥ,
<div n="lb"/>ākāśād vāyuḥ vāyoragniḥ, agnerāpaḥ adbhyaḥ pṛthvī
<div n="lb"/>pṛthivyā oṣadhayaḥ oṣadhibhyo annam annāt puruṣaḥ
<div n="lb"/>sa vā eṣa puruṣo annamayaḥ.”
<div n="NI"/>‘From this Ātman came into existence ether possessing the
<div n="lb"/>quality of sound. From ether air, possessing the qualities
<div n="lb"/>of sound and touch, came into existence. Fire with the
<div n="lb"/>qualities of sound, touch and colour came into being
<div n="lb"/>from air. From fire, water having the qualities of sound
<div n="lb"/>touch, colour and taste came into being. From water earth
<div n="lb"/>with the qualities of sound, touch, colour, taste and smell
<div n="lb"/>came into existence. Vegetation grew from earth, and
<div n="lb"/>from vegetation food, from food semen, and from semen
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣa came into existence. The materialized form of
<div n="lb"/>aparabrahman is the body. Its subtle form is the soul.
<div n="lb"/>Jīvātmā or the individual soul is the subtle form of soul
<div n="lb"/>dwelling in the materialized form of the aparabrahman.
<div n="lb"/>This soul sits in the miniature lotus of heart in the
<div n="lb"/>miniature either. The body which is made of the five
<div n="lb"/>elements is the dwelling place of this Jīvātmā. The
<div n="lb"/>individual life exists in every living being. The body
<div n="lb"/>originated from food is the outer covering of the Jīvāt-
<div n="lb"/>mā. This materialized body is also called Annamaya-
<div n="lb"/>kośa (the cask of food). Inside this annamayakośa there
<div n="lb"/>is the Prāṇamayakośa (the chest of the life breaths). It is
<div n="lb"/>stated in the Taittirīyopaniṣad that this Prāṇamayakośa
<div n="lb"/>is separate from and existing inside the annamayakośa.
<div n="lb"/>The Prāṇamayakośa which exists inside the annama-
<div n="lb"/>yakośa has the shape of man. The life breath which
<div n="lb"/>appears as the inhaling and exhaling breath is the head
<div n="lb"/>of the Prāṇamayakośa. The life breath Vyāna is the
<div n="lb"/>right wing and Apāna is the left wing, ether its soul and
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthvi (the earth) its tail.
<F>2) Tasya prāṇa eva śiraḥ vyāno dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ apānaḥ uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ ākāśa ātmā, Pṛthivī puccham. (Taittirīya).</F> Inside the Prāṇamayakośa,
<div n="lb"/>there exists the Manomayakośa (the chest of mind),
[Page359-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>but it fills the entire interior of the Prāṇamayakośa.
<div n="lb"/>The Vijñānamayakośa (the chest of knowledge or under-
<div n="lb"/>standing) exists inside the Manomayakośa. The Jīvātmā
<div n="lb"/>or the individual life dwells inside this Vijñānamaya-
<div n="lb"/>kośa and pervades the entire body. It is by the activity
<div n="lb"/>of Vijñānamayakośa that the Jīvātmā feels its indivi-
<div n="lb"/>duality. Inside the Vijñānamayakośa there exists a fifth
<div n="lb"/>kośa (chest) called the Ānandamayakośa, which is the
<div n="lb"/>immediate covering of Jīvātmā, and which has no sense
<div n="lb"/>of individuality. The three Kośas, Ānandakośa, Vijñāna-
<div n="lb"/>kośa and Prāṇamayakośa together is called Sūkṣmaśarīra
<div n="lb"/>(the subtle body). It must be remembered that Sūkṣ-
<div n="lb"/>maśarīra is different from Susūkṣmaśarīra (the minute
<div n="lb"/>subtle body).
<div n="NI"/>Heart is the abode of the Jīvātmā. Hṛdi (in heart)
<div n="lb"/>ayam (this being—Jīvātmā exists). So the name ‘Hṛd-
<div n="lb"/>aya’ (heart) is meaningful.
<F>1) Ayaṃ puruṣaḥ bhāḥ satyaḥ tasmin antarhrdaye yathā vrīhir vā, yavovā, sa eṣa sarvasyeśānaḥ sarvasyādhipatih.
<div n="lb"/>(Bṛhadāraṇyaka)</F> The Puruṣa (male being),
<div n="lb"/>which sits inside the heart or the Jīvātmā is as big as
<div n="lb"/>the toe according to the Kaṭhopaniṣad.
<div n="NI"/>The Jīvātmā or the Aparabrahman is without beginning.
<div n="lb"/>Even from the past which is beyond our thinking crores
<div n="lb"/>and crores of Jīvātmans had got into individuals and
<div n="lb"/>when the Annamayakośas of the individuals decayed
<div n="lb"/>due to death, they abandoned them and entered into
<div n="lb"/>new individuals. The author of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
<div n="lb"/>gives an explanation to the question why this Jīvātmā
<div n="lb"/>which is as free as air enters the body of man, beast,
<div n="lb"/>bird, tree, rock etc. and subjects itself to misery and
<div n="lb"/>hardship. “Where does the Jīvātmā originate from? how
<div n="lb"/>does it enter this body?” Jīvātmā originates from Para-
<div n="lb"/>mātmā (the soul of the universe). As the shadow
<div n="lb"/>pervades the body of a man this Jīvātmā overshadows
<div n="lb"/>this body.” Śrī Śaṅkarācārya expounds it in another
<div n="lb"/>way; he says that the Jīvātmā is tied to the body by
<div n="lb"/>the imagination or desires of the mind.
