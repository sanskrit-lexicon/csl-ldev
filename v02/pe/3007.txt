JĪVĀTMAN¦ {%(The individual life or soul).%} The Apara-
brahman (which is next to the highest Brahman) that
is so minute and subtle is called Jīvātman. Parabrahman
is God almighty. It is mentioned in Taittirīyopaniṣad
about this aparabrahman as follows :
<div n="NI"/>“Tasmād vā etasmādātmana ākāśaḥ sambhūtaḥ,
ākāśād vāyuḥ vāyoragniḥ, agnerāpaḥ adbhyaḥ pṛthvī
pṛthivyā oṣadhayaḥ oṣadhibhyo annam annāt puruṣaḥ
sa vā eṣa puruṣo annamayaḥ.”
<div n="NI"/>‘From this Ātman came into existence ether possessing the
quality of sound. From ether air, possessing the qualities
of sound and touch, came into existence. Fire with the
qualities of sound, touch and colour came into being
from air. From fire, water having the qualities of sound
touch, colour and taste came into being. From water earth
with the qualities of sound, touch, colour, taste and smell
came into existence. Vegetation grew from earth, and
from vegetation food, from food semen, and from semen
Puruṣa came into existence. The materialized form of
aparabrahman is the body. Its subtle form is the soul.
Jīvātmā or the individual soul is the subtle form of soul
dwelling in the materialized form of the aparabrahman.
This soul sits in the miniature lotus of heart in the
miniature either. The body which is made of the five
elements is the dwelling place of this Jīvātmā. The
individual life exists in every living being. The body
originated from food is the outer covering of the Jīvāt-
mā. This materialized body is also called Annamaya-
kośa (the cask of food). Inside this annamayakośa there
is the Prāṇamayakośa (the chest of the life breaths). It is
stated in the Taittirīyopaniṣad that this Prāṇamayakośa
is separate from and existing inside the annamayakośa.
The Prāṇamayakośa which exists inside the annama-
yakośa has the shape of man. The life breath which
appears as the inhaling and exhaling breath is the head
of the Prāṇamayakośa. The life breath Vyāna is the
right wing and Apāna is the left wing, ether its soul and
Pṛthvi (the earth) its tail.
<F>2) Tasya prāṇa eva śiraḥ vyāno dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ apānaḥ uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ ākāśa ātmā, Pṛthivī puccham. (Taittirīya).</F> Inside the Prāṇamayakośa,
there exists the Manomayakośa (the chest of mind),
[Page359-a+ 65]
but it fills the entire interior of the Prāṇamayakośa.
The Vijñānamayakośa (the chest of knowledge or under-
standing) exists inside the Manomayakośa. The Jīvātmā
or the individual life dwells inside this Vijñānamaya-
kośa and pervades the entire body. It is by the activity
of Vijñānamayakośa that the Jīvātmā feels its indivi-
duality. Inside the Vijñānamayakośa there exists a fifth
kośa (chest) called the Ānandamayakośa, which is the
immediate covering of Jīvātmā, and which has no sense
of individuality. The three Kośas, Ānandakośa, Vijñāna-
kośa and Prāṇamayakośa together is called Sūkṣmaśarīra
(the subtle body). It must be remembered that Sūkṣ-
maśarīra is different from Susūkṣmaśarīra (the minute
subtle body).
<div n="NI"/>Heart is the abode of the Jīvātmā. Hṛdi (in heart)
ayam (this being—Jīvātmā exists). So the name ‘Hṛd-
aya’ (heart) is meaningful.
<F>1) Ayaṃ puruṣaḥ bhāḥ satyaḥ tasmin antarhrdaye yathā vrīhir vā, yavovā, sa eṣa sarvasyeśānaḥ sarvasyādhipatih.
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka)</F> The Puruṣa (male being),
which sits inside the heart or the Jīvātmā is as big as
the toe according to the Kaṭhopaniṣad.
<div n="NI"/>The Jīvātmā or the Aparabrahman is without beginning.
Even from the past which is beyond our thinking crores
and crores of Jīvātmans had got into individuals and
when the Annamayakośas of the individuals decayed
due to death, they abandoned them and entered into
new individuals. The author of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
gives an explanation to the question why this Jīvātmā
which is as free as air enters the body of man, beast,
bird, tree, rock etc. and subjects itself to misery and
hardship. “Where does the Jīvātmā originate from? how
does it enter this body?” Jīvātmā originates from Para-
mātmā (the soul of the universe). As the shadow
pervades the body of a man this Jīvātmā overshadows
this body.” Śrī Śaṅkarācārya expounds it in another
way; he says that the Jīvātmā is tied to the body by
the imagination or desires of the mind.
