BHŪMI I¦. The earth.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The Purāṇas maintain that Bhūmi has a
<div n="lb"/>Devī (goddess). The births of Bhūmi and its basic
<div n="lb"/>goddess are in two different ways.
<div n="NI"/>The Mahābhārata, (Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha) says that the
<div n="lb"/>goddess Bhūmi was the daughter of Brahmā and that
<div n="lb"/>she was married by Mahāviṣṇu. The earth on which
<div n="lb"/>we live is the Mṛtpiṇḍa of which the basic deity is this
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmidevī. Of the many versions given in the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>regarding the origin of earth, three are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) Long ago, towards the end of the age of floods, the
<div n="lb"/>earth was in a liquid state. At that time, Śiva cut open
<div n="lb"/>his thigh and let fall a drop of blood in the water.
<div n="lb"/>It assumed the form of an “aṇḍa” (egg). Śiva took that
<div n="lb"/>aṇḍa and split it. A man came out of it. From him was
<div n="lb"/>made Nature (Prakṛti) for the creation of the Universe.
<div n="lb"/>One half of the broken aṇḍa became sky and the other
<div n="lb"/>half became the earth. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭha-
<div n="lb"/>laṃbaka, 2nd Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Mahāviṣṇu lay on the surface of water which spread
<div n="lb"/>everywhere in the beginning. A lotus sprang up from
[Page142-b+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>the navel of Viṣṇu and from its top Brahmā was born.
<div n="lb"/>Liquid matter began to flow out of Viṣṇu's ears on both
<div n="lb"/>sides. From it were born two Rākṣasas named Madhu
<div n="lb"/>and Kaiṭabha. They persecuted Brahmā. Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>woke up and killed Madhu and Kaiṭabha. The thick
<div n="lb"/>fat of these Rākṣasas hardened into the earth. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) In the beginning Mahāviṣṇu (Mahāvirāṭ Puruṣa)
<div n="lb"/>spread everywhere. In every pore of that Mahāvirāṭ
<div n="lb"/>who was lying on the surface of the water, there was a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāṇḍa. In course of time that Virāṭ obtained mind.
<div n="lb"/>That mind stood connected with each of the pores
<div n="lb"/>equally. Later from it were formed the “Pañcamahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhūtas”. From their combination was formed the Bhūta
<div n="lb"/>called “Mahā Pṛthvī”. It was cut into many pieces
<div n="lb"/>and each of the pieces was deposited in each pore.
<div n="lb"/>It was these Pṛthvī pieces which became “Bhūmis”
<div n="lb"/>at the time of creation. At the time of the floods, these
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmis sank again into those pores as before. In each
<div n="lb"/>of these Brahmāṇḍas, there are the earth, mountains,
<div n="lb"/>forests, oceans, the seven islands, Himavān, Meru,
<div n="lb"/>Sun, Moon, Stars and other planets. Also, each of
<div n="lb"/>them has its own Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and other Devas.
<div n="lb"/>Since all the different Bhūmis in all the Brahmāṇḍas
<div n="lb"/>had been formed artificially, they all perish in the floods.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) Bhūmi Devī (Goddess Earth) is the wife of Mahā
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu. In Varāha Kalpa (Age of the Pig) the Asura
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyākṣa carried the Earth and Submerged it under
<div n="lb"/>water. At once Mahā viṣṇu appeared in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>Pig and lifted up the Earth on its horns. When the Earth
<div n="lb"/>floated on the surface of water like a lotus leaf, Bhūmi
<div n="lb"/>Devī who was pleased, stood up in her charming figure.
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu fell in love with her and with the brilliance
<div n="lb"/>of a crore of suns, had sexual union with her for the
<div n="lb"/>period of one Devavarṣa. It is from that time that
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmi Devī became Mahāviṣṇu's wife. As a result
<div n="lb"/>of their union, a son named Maṅgala was born to
<div n="lb"/>them.
<div n="NI"/>Ghaṭeśa is the son of Maṅgala. Maṅgala has another
<div n="lb"/>name, Covva. After the birth of Maṅgala, at the behest
<div n="lb"/>of Lord Viṣṇu, all people began to offer worship to
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmidevī. Mahāviṣṇu himself first worshipped her
<div n="lb"/>by reciting the mantra—“Om Hrīṃ-Śrīṃ-Krīṃ-Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>dhāyai Svāhā”. After that this mantra became popular
<div n="lb"/>for worshipping Bhūmidevī. (Devī Bhāgavata, Navama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Narakāsura was Bhūmidevī's son by Hiraṇyākṣa, the
<div n="lb"/>Asura. When Hiraṇyākṣa, in the form of a pig, carried
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmidevī on his horns to Pātāla, the horns came in
<div n="lb"/>contact with Bhūmidevī and she became pregnant.
<div n="lb"/>In Bhāgavata, Daśama Skandha we read that Narakā-
<div n="lb"/>sura was born as the result of this contact. (See the
<div n="lb"/>word Naraka I).
<div n="NI"/>Sītā was the daughter of Bhūmidevī, born on another
<div n="lb"/>occasion. Sītā was married by the Kosala King Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. When she was abandoned by her husband,
<div n="lb"/>she was at last accepted by Bhūmidevī within her own
<div n="lb"/>self. (See the word Sītā).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Bhūmi and Prahlāda.%} Since Bhūmidevī had been the
<div n="lb"/>wife of the Asura Hiraṇyākṣa she has also been called
<div n="lb"/>the mother of the Asura clan. Hiraṇyākṣa's brother was
[Page143-a+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu. Prahlāda, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu,
<div n="lb"/>was a devotee of Viṣṇu. The father did not like the son's
<div n="lb"/>devotion to Viṣṇu. So he persecuted Prahlāda in various
<div n="lb"/>ways. Once he threw down Prahlāda from the top of
<div n="lb"/>a high building. At that time Bhūmi devī appeared there
<div n="lb"/>and received him in her arms. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 24).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Bhūmidevī and Pṛthu.%} Once the Emperor Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>turned Bhūmidevī into a cow and milched all resources
<div n="lb"/>from her. (For details, see the word Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Pārvatī's curse.%} Once Pārvatī and Śiva indulged in
<div n="lb"/>their sexual act for many years. The earth began to
<div n="lb"/>shake to its foundations. The gods approached Śiva
<div n="lb"/>with a request to refrain and he agreed. Śiva's semen
<div n="lb"/>was discharged and fell on the earth. Pārvatī who was
<div n="lb"/>angry at this, cursed Bhūmidevī as follows:—“You
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmidevī! You will assume many forms and become
<div n="lb"/>the wife of many. Since you have prevented me from
<div n="lb"/>giving birth to a son, no children will be born to you
<div n="lb"/>in future.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, 36th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Narakāsura has another name, “Bhauma”. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Bhūmidevī prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and obtained Vaiṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vāstra for her son Narakāsura. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 29, Verse 30).
<div n="NI"/>(3) When Paraśurāma was carrying on the annihilation
<div n="lb"/>of Kṣatriyas, Bhūmidevī induced the sage Kaśyapa to
<div n="lb"/>entreat Paraśurāma to stop his massacre of Bhūpālas.
<div n="lb"/>(Protectors of Bhūmi=Kṣatriyas). (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 79, Verse 44).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Once she (Bhūmidevī) described to Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>the greatness of Brahminhood. (M.B. Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 22).
<div n="NI"/>(5) At another time she explained to Śrī Kṛṣṇa the
<div n="lb"/>nature of Gṛhasthāśramadharma, (Duties of a house-
<div n="lb"/>holder). (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 97, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>(6) On one occasion, when King Aṅga touched her,
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmidevī lost her own form and vanished. At that
<div n="lb"/>time, Kaśyapa prajāpati paralysed her. (M.B. Anuśā-
<div n="lb"/>sana Parva, Chapter 152, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Paraśurāma gifted the whole earth to the sage
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa. From that time Bhūmidevī has been called
<div n="lb"/>“Kāśyapī” (daughter of Kaśyapa). (M.B. Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 154, Verse 7).
