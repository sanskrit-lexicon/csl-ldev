BHŪMI I¦. The earth.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The Purāṇas maintain that Bhūmi has a
Devī (goddess). The births of Bhūmi and its basic
goddess are in two different ways.
<div n="NI"/>The Mahābhārata, (Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha) says that the
goddess Bhūmi was the daughter of Brahmā and that
she was married by Mahāviṣṇu. The earth on which
we live is the Mṛtpiṇḍa of which the basic deity is this
Bhūmidevī. Of the many versions given in the Purāṇas
regarding the origin of earth, three are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) Long ago, towards the end of the age of floods, the
earth was in a liquid state. At that time, Śiva cut open
his thigh and let fall a drop of blood in the water.
It assumed the form of an “aṇḍa” (egg). Śiva took that
aṇḍa and split it. A man came out of it. From him was
made Nature (Prakṛti) for the creation of the Universe.
One half of the broken aṇḍa became sky and the other
half became the earth. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭha-
laṃbaka, 2nd Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Mahāviṣṇu lay on the surface of water which spread
everywhere in the beginning. A lotus sprang up from
[Page142-b+ 62]
the navel of Viṣṇu and from its top Brahmā was born.
Liquid matter began to flow out of Viṣṇu's ears on both
sides. From it were born two Rākṣasas named Madhu
and Kaiṭabha. They persecuted Brahmā. Mahāviṣṇu
woke up and killed Madhu and Kaiṭabha. The thick
fat of these Rākṣasas hardened into the earth. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) In the beginning Mahāviṣṇu (Mahāvirāṭ Puruṣa)
spread everywhere. In every pore of that Mahāvirāṭ
who was lying on the surface of the water, there was a
Brahmāṇḍa. In course of time that Virāṭ obtained mind.
That mind stood connected with each of the pores
equally. Later from it were formed the “Pañcamahā-
bhūtas”. From their combination was formed the Bhūta
called “Mahā Pṛthvī”. It was cut into many pieces
and each of the pieces was deposited in each pore.
It was these Pṛthvī pieces which became “Bhūmis”
at the time of creation. At the time of the floods, these
Bhūmis sank again into those pores as before. In each
of these Brahmāṇḍas, there are the earth, mountains,
forests, oceans, the seven islands, Himavān, Meru,
Sun, Moon, Stars and other planets. Also, each of
them has its own Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and other Devas.
Since all the different Bhūmis in all the Brahmāṇḍas
had been formed artificially, they all perish in the floods.
(Devī Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) Bhūmi Devī (Goddess Earth) is the wife of Mahā
Viṣṇu. In Varāha Kalpa (Age of the Pig) the Asura
Hiraṇyākṣa carried the Earth and Submerged it under
water. At once Mahā viṣṇu appeared in the form of a
Pig and lifted up the Earth on its horns. When the Earth
floated on the surface of water like a lotus leaf, Bhūmi
Devī who was pleased, stood up in her charming figure.
Mahāviṣṇu fell in love with her and with the brilliance
of a crore of suns, had sexual union with her for the
period of one Devavarṣa. It is from that time that
Bhūmi Devī became Mahāviṣṇu's wife. As a result
of their union, a son named Maṅgala was born to
them.
<div n="NI"/>Ghaṭeśa is the son of Maṅgala. Maṅgala has another
name, Covva. After the birth of Maṅgala, at the behest
of Lord Viṣṇu, all people began to offer worship to
Bhūmidevī. Mahāviṣṇu himself first worshipped her
by reciting the mantra—“Om Hrīṃ-Śrīṃ-Krīṃ-Vasu-
dhāyai Svāhā”. After that this mantra became popular
for worshipping Bhūmidevī. (Devī Bhāgavata, Navama
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Narakāsura was Bhūmidevī's son by Hiraṇyākṣa, the
Asura. When Hiraṇyākṣa, in the form of a pig, carried
Bhūmidevī on his horns to Pātāla, the horns came in
contact with Bhūmidevī and she became pregnant.
In Bhāgavata, Daśama Skandha we read that Narakā-
sura was born as the result of this contact. (See the
word Naraka I).
<div n="NI"/>Sītā was the daughter of Bhūmidevī, born on another
occasion. Sītā was married by the Kosala King Śrī
Rāma. When she was abandoned by her husband,
she was at last accepted by Bhūmidevī within her own
self. (See the word Sītā).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Bhūmi and Prahlāda.%} Since Bhūmidevī had been the
wife of the Asura Hiraṇyākṣa she has also been called
the mother of the Asura clan. Hiraṇyākṣa's brother was
[Page143-a+ 61]
Hiraṇyakaśipu. Prahlāda, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu,
was a devotee of Viṣṇu. The father did not like the son's
devotion to Viṣṇu. So he persecuted Prahlāda in various
ways. Once he threw down Prahlāda from the top of
a high building. At that time Bhūmi devī appeared there
and received him in her arms. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chapter 24).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Bhūmidevī and Pṛthu.%} Once the Emperor Pṛthu
turned Bhūmidevī into a cow and milched all resources
from her. (For details, see the word Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Pārvatī's curse.%} Once Pārvatī and Śiva indulged in
their sexual act for many years. The earth began to
shake to its foundations. The gods approached Śiva
with a request to refrain and he agreed. Śiva's semen
was discharged and fell on the earth. Pārvatī who was
angry at this, cursed Bhūmidevī as follows:—“You
Bhūmidevī! You will assume many forms and become
the wife of many. Since you have prevented me from
giving birth to a son, no children will be born to you
in future.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, 36th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Narakāsura has another name, “Bhauma”. (M.B.
Sabhā Parva, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Bhūmidevī prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and obtained Vaiṣṇa-
vāstra for her son Narakāsura. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
Chapter 29, Verse 30).
<div n="NI"/>(3) When Paraśurāma was carrying on the annihilation
of Kṣatriyas, Bhūmidevī induced the sage Kaśyapa to
entreat Paraśurāma to stop his massacre of Bhūpālas.
(Protectors of Bhūmi=Kṣatriyas). (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 79, Verse 44).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Once she (Bhūmidevī) described to Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
the greatness of Brahminhood. (M.B. Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 22).
<div n="NI"/>(5) At another time she explained to Śrī Kṛṣṇa the
nature of Gṛhasthāśramadharma, (Duties of a house-
holder). (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 97, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>(6) On one occasion, when King Aṅga touched her,
Bhūmidevī lost her own form and vanished. At that
time, Kaśyapa prajāpati paralysed her. (M.B. Anuśā-
sana Parva, Chapter 152, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Paraśurāma gifted the whole earth to the sage
Kaśyapa. From that time Bhūmidevī has been called
“Kāśyapī” (daughter of Kaśyapa). (M.B. Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 154, Verse 7).
