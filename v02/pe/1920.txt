DHANVANTARI II¦. (Amṛtācārya). An eminent medi-
<div n="lb"/>cal scientist born in the ambaṣṭha caste. There is no
<div n="lb"/>reference anywhere in the Purāṇas regarding any
<div n="lb"/>relationship between the two Dhanvantaris. There is
<div n="lb"/>the following story about Amṛtācārya in Ambaṣṭhācāra-
<div n="lb"/>candrikā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Gālava Maharṣi went to the forest to collect
<div n="lb"/>darbha and firewood. He walked for long and felt
<div n="lb"/>thirsty and hungry. Then he saw a girl coming that
<div n="lb"/>way with water and Gālava quenched his thirst taking
<div n="lb"/>water from her. Pleased with her the Maharṣi blessed
<div n="lb"/>her saying “May you get a good son.” The girl replied
<div n="lb"/>that she was still unmarried. Gālava then made a figure
<div n="lb"/>of a male with darbha and told her to get a child from
<div n="lb"/>that figure. She was a Vaiśya girl named Vīrabhadrā
<div n="lb"/>and she got a beautiful child of that darbha male.
<div n="lb"/>Because the boy was born to a Vaiśya of a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>male he belonged to the Ambaṣṭha caste. The boy was
<div n="lb"/>named Amṛtācārya.
