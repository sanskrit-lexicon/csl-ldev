BHĀRATA¦ (MAHĀBHĀRATA). An epic written by
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The Mahābhārata is an epic.
<div n="lb"/>Bharata is acclaimed as the first emperor of Bhārata.
<div n="lb"/>The theme of this great epic is the fight between the
<div n="lb"/>two lines of princes belonging to the dynasty of Bharata.
<div n="lb"/>That is why the book is called Mahābhārata.
<div n="lb"/>The great size of the volume and the greatness of
<div n="lb"/>the wisdom contained therein have contributed much
<div n="lb"/>to its getting the name, Mahābhārata. Once the
<div n="lb"/>devas put the Mahābhārata in one pan of a balance
<div n="lb"/>and the Vedas in the other pan. Then the devas
<div n="lb"/>were convinced that the Mahābhārata weighed more
<div n="lb"/>than all the Vedas put together. (Ślokas 269-271,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1, Ādi Parva, M.B.).

<div n="lb"/>over a lakh of verses. There is no subject on earth
<div n="lb"/>which is not dealt with in the Mahābhārata. None of
[Page121-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the world's epics is so big as Mahābhārata. In size the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata is double that of Homer's Iliad and
<div n="lb"/>Odyssey put together. The following poem about it is
<div n="lb"/>worth mentioning now:
<Poem>Yathā samudro bhagavan
<div n="lb"/>Yathā ca himavān giriḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Khyātāvubhau ratnanidhī
<div n="lb"/>Tathā bhāratamucyate //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata is not a mere epic. It is a whole literature
<div n="lb"/>in itself containing a philosophy which has been an
<div n="lb"/>unfailing and perennial source of spiritual strength to
<div n="lb"/>the people of India. Above all it has for its core the
<div n="lb"/>Gītā which is perhaps the noblest of scriptures.
<div n="NI"/>The Mahābhārata comprises eighteen books, each book
<div n="lb"/>being called a Parva. There are 2109 chapters in it, the
<div n="lb"/>chapters differing in size. Besides, there is an annexe
<div n="lb"/>called Harivaṃśa which deals with the life and history
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Contents.%} The contents of each Parva are succinctly
<div n="lb"/>given below: The Parvas are so named as to give a
<div n="lb"/>hint of their central theme.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Ādi Parva.%} (Ādi = beginning). Pāṇḍu and Dhṛta-
<div n="lb"/>rāṣṭra, king of the Candra dynasty, are brothers. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>brought them up. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was born blind and he
<div n="lb"/>got a hundred children of his wife Gāndhārī. They
<div n="lb"/>were called the Kauravas. Pāṇḍu had two wives Kuntī
<div n="lb"/>and Mādrī and got of them five sons called the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas headed by the eldest Yudhiṣṭhira.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Sabhā Parva%} (Sabhā = court). The Pāṇḍavas and
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas lived together in the court at Hastināpura.
<div n="lb"/>There, the Kauravas entered into a game of dice with
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira and through the deceitful tactics engineer-
<div n="lb"/>ed by the keen-witted Śakuni, Yudhiṣṭhira was defeated
<div n="lb"/>and he lost everything he possessed. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>were then compelled to go into exile to the forests for
<div n="lb"/>twelve years and spend another year after that incog-
<div n="lb"/>nito. If they were found out during that period of
<div n="lb"/>incognito they were to go into exile for another term
<div n="lb"/>of twelve years. The Pāṇḍavas accompanied by Pāñcālī
<div n="lb"/>left for the forests.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Vana Parva%} (Vana = forest). This is one of the
<div n="lb"/>longest of Parvas and describes the life of the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>in the forest Kāmyaka. The well known stories ‘Nala
<div n="lb"/>Carita’ and ‘Kirātārjunīya’ are told in this Parva’.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Virāṭa Purva.%} (Virāṭa = name of a King). The Pāṇḍav-
<div n="lb"/>as after completing their term of exile in the forests spent
<div n="lb"/>the year of their life in incognito at the court of King
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa. Many wonderful events took place during their
<div n="lb"/>stay there and this Parva deals in detail about
<div n="lb"/>them.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Bhīṣma Parva%} (Bhīṣma = The first Generalissimo of
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas). The great Mahābhārata war was fought
<div n="lb"/>in the vast expanse of Kurukṣetra lying to the north-
<div n="lb"/>west of Delhi. Bhīṣma was the first generalissimo of the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas and Dhṛṣṭadyumna of the Pāṇḍavas. Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>describes the events of the battle classifying it accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the generalissimos of the Kaurava army giving
<div n="lb"/>the four generalissimos a Parva each. Bhīṣma fought
<div n="lb"/>for ten days and was struck down on the tenth day by
<div n="lb"/>an arrow from Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Droṇa Parva%} (Droṇa = The second Generalissimo).
<div n="lb"/>When Bhīṣma fell Droṇa took charge as the supreme
<div n="lb"/>commander. This Parva deals with the fight under his
<div n="lb"/>command. Droṇa was killed in the end by Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>dyumna.
[Page121-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Karṇa Parva.%} (Karṇa = The third generalissimo).
<div n="lb"/>This Parva deals with the war under the command of
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa. Karṇa fell in the end at the hands of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Śalya Parva.%} (Śalya = The fourth and last of the
<div n="lb"/>Generalissimos). When Karṇa fell Śalya took over
<div n="lb"/>charge of the Kaurava army. As the war was coming to
<div n="lb"/>an end most of the big warriors of the Kaurava army
<div n="lb"/>were killed. In the end Bhīma and Duryodhana met
<div n="lb"/>in a grim fight with maces in which Duryodhana was
<div n="lb"/>killed. This Parva deals with the final stage of the
<div n="lb"/>battle.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Sauptika Parva.%} (Sauptika = pertaining to sleep).
<div n="lb"/>This Parva tells us the tragic story of how Kṛpācārya,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavarmā and Aśvatthāmā who were the only three
<div n="lb"/>left with Duryodhana after the great battle went into
<div n="lb"/>the camp of the Pāṇḍavas at night and killed all the
<div n="lb"/>brave warriors of the Pāṇḍava army, excepting the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas, who were sleeping in their camp unaware of
<div n="lb"/>the foul play lying ahead.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Strī Parva.%} (Strī = woman). This Parva deals with
<div n="lb"/>the great lamentation in the battlefield, after the war,
<div n="lb"/>of Gāndhārī and other women.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Śānti Parva.%} Yudhiṣṭhira was crowned king and
<div n="lb"/>even at that time Bhīṣma was lying on his bed of arrows
<div n="lb"/>awaiting death. Before taking up his duties of the state
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira went to where the grandsire lay dying and
<div n="lb"/>took his blessing and instruction in dharma. This
<div n="lb"/>instruction of Bhīṣmācārya to King Yudhiṣṭhira of the
<div n="lb"/>three dharmas, Rājadharma, Āpaddharma and Mokṣa-
<div n="lb"/>dharma is the famous Śanti Parva.
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Anuśāsana Parva.%} (Anuśāsana = Instruction).
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma still on his death-bed continues his instructions
<div n="lb"/>on several topics, like duty, freedom and fasting, giving
<div n="lb"/>entertaining stories to illustrate the essence of his teach-
<div n="lb"/>ing. This Parva is devoted to this.
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Āśvamedhika Parva.%} (Aśvamedha = yāga conduct-
<div n="lb"/>ed by emperors). This Parva deals with the yāga
<div n="lb"/>conducted by Yudhiṣṭhira when he became the empe-
<div n="lb"/>ror of Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Āśramavāsika Parva.%} (Āśramavāsa = life in a her-
<div n="lb"/>mitage). Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the blind and his wife Gāndhārī
<div n="lb"/>accompanied by Kuntī left for the forests and lived
<div n="lb"/>there for two years in a hermitage. One day the forest
<div n="lb"/>caught fire and the three without trying to escape sat
<div n="lb"/>on the ground facing eastwards in yoga posture and
<div n="lb"/>calmly gave up themselves to the flames. This is dealt
<div n="lb"/>with in this Parva.
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Mausala Parva.%} (Mausala = Mace). This Parva
<div n="lb"/>gives the story of how the Yādavas fought against each
<div n="lb"/>other with maces and were destroyed and how
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā sank down into the ocean. It describes the
<div n="lb"/>death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma also.
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Mahāprasthānika Parva.%} (Mahāprasthāna = Death).
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra entrusts his kingdom to his successor and
<div n="lb"/>along with his four brothers and wife Pāñcālī sets out
<div n="lb"/>on a long journey to Mahāmeru never to return. This
<div n="lb"/>journey to death is detailed in this Parva.
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Svargārohaṇa Parva.%} (Svarga = Heaven). This Parva
<div n="lb"/>describes the entry of the Pāṇḍavas and their relatives
<div n="lb"/>into Svarga, heaven.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mode of Narration.%} Most of the verses in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata are in the Anuṣṭup metre. At certain
<div n="lb"/>places other metres also have been used. There are
<div n="lb"/>prose pieces also in it. There are twenty notable pieces,
<div n="lb"/>three in Ādi Parva, seven in Vana Parva, seven in Śānti
[Page122-a+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>Parva and three in Anuśāsana Parva. All the pieces are
<div n="lb"/>statements by realised souls. The style of the poetry is
<div n="lb"/>simple and the method of presentation lively. At times
<div n="lb"/>the imagination of the poet extends up to the horizon.
<div n="lb"/>Though there is a flow of spiritualism throughout the
<div n="lb"/>matter is purely mundane.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Authorship.%} Bhagavān Vyāsa is believed to be the
<div n="lb"/>author of Mahābhārata. He was a contemporary of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas. Many of the events of the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata were personally witnessed by Vyāsa. He
<div n="lb"/>took three years to write this book. The following
<div n="lb"/>ślokas will support the above:
<Poem>Kururāja kulasthānāṃ
<div n="lb"/>Dṛṣṭaṃ vṛttaṃ ca yatsthitam /
<div n="lb"/>Tatsarvaṃ bhagavān Vyāso
<div n="lb"/>Varṇayāmāsa Bhārate. //
<div n="lb"/>(Padma purāṇa)
<div n="lb"/>Tribhirvarṣaiḥ sadotthāyi
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇadvaipāyano muniḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhāratamākhyānaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtavānidamuttamam. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 55, Chapter 62, Ādi Parva).
<div n="lb"/>The Varāha Purāṇa states that Vyāsa composed the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata at a period when the end of Dvāpara
<div n="lb"/>yuga merged with the dawn of the Kaliyuga. The
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata states that Śrī Kṛṣṇa passed away on the
<div n="lb"/>first day of Kaliyuga. The Bhāgavata is devoted to
<div n="lb"/>admire and praise the life of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This book also
<div n="lb"/>is written by Vyāsa. This śloka found in the first Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter of Ādi Parva clears the doubt:
<Poem>Vāsudevasya māhātmyaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavānāṃ ca satyatām /
<div n="lb"/>Durvṛttaṃ Dhārttarāṣṭrāṇāṃ
<div n="lb"/>Uktavān Bhagavānṛṣiḥ. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>The original name of the Bhārata which Vyāsa compos-
<div n="lb"/>ed was ‘Jaya’. In the first Chapter of Ādi Parva is this
<div n="lb"/>śloka to support this statement:
<Poem>Nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtya
<div n="lb"/>Naraṃ caiva narottamaṃ/
<div n="lb"/>Devīṃ Sarasvatīṃ caiva
<div n="lb"/>Tato Jayamudīrayet//</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>After the death of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas the
<div n="lb"/>disciples of Vyāsa, Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Śuka and
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśampāyana gave this book great publicity. They
<div n="lb"/>wrote books based on this story of Bhārata of which
<div n="lb"/>only the ‘Bhārata’ of Vaiśampāyana and the Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha Parva of Jaimini are now available.
<div n="NI"/>Vyāsa's Bhārata was first expounded by Vaiśampāyana
<div n="lb"/>at the Sarpa-satra of Janamejaya. At the request of
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana added some more facts to
<div n="lb"/>the original work known then as ‘Jaya’. Jaya with the
[Page122-b+ 69]
<div n="lb"/>accretions came to be known as Bhāratasaṃhitā. Sūta
<div n="lb"/>who narrated this story to Śaunaka and others at the
<div n="lb"/>forest of Naimiśa added some more matter to the
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratasaṃhitā and made it larger. The present
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata is this expanded edition.
<div n="NI"/>The following facts prove that the Mahābhārata has
<div n="lb"/>thus passed through three stages of evolution:
<div n="NI"/>1) This book is known by three names: Jaya, Bhārata-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā and Mahābhārata.
<F>1) <Poem>(a) Jayo nāmetihāso'yaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Śrotavyo vijigīṣuṇā (Śloka 22, Chapter 62, Ādi Parva).
<div n="lb"/>(b) Caturviṃśati sāhasrīṃ
<div n="lb"/>Cakre bhāratasaṃhitām
<div n="lb"/>Upākhyānairvinā tāvad
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratam procyate budhaiḥ
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 78, Chapter 1, Ādi Parva).
<div n="lb"/>(c) Refer to the śloka given in para 1.</Poem></F>
<div n="NI"/>2) There is a reference to the three parts of the book
<div n="lb"/>in Śloka 66, Chapter 1 of Ādi Parva.
<F>2) <Poem>Manvādi Bhārataṃ kecid
<div n="lb"/>Āstikādi tathāpare
<div n="lb"/>Tathopari carādanye
<div n="lb"/>Viprāḥ samyagadhīyire.</Poem></F>
<div n="NI"/>3) There are three different opinions regarding the
<div n="lb"/>total number of ślokas in the Mahābhārata. According
<div n="lb"/>to Ugraśravas there are 8800 verses, according to Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>24000 verses and according to another statement a
<div n="lb"/>lakh of verses.
<F>3) <Poem>Idaṃ śatasahasraṃ tu lokānām puṇyakarmaṇām
<div n="lb"/>Upākhyānaiḥ saha jñeyamādyaṃ bhāratamuttamam
<div n="lb"/>Caturvimśati sāhasrīṃ cakre bhāratasaṃhitām
<div n="lb"/>Upākhyānairvinā tāvad bhārataṃ procyate budhaiḥ
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭau ślokasahasrāṇi Aṣṭau ślokaśatāni ca
<div n="lb"/>Ahaṃ vedmi śuko vetti Sañjayo vetti vā na vā.</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<div n="NI"/>4) The narration appears to be of three different kinds,
<div n="lb"/>descriptive, philosophical and oratorical, indicative of
<div n="lb"/>three different authorships.
<div n="NI"/>5) Sūta and Vaiśampāyana have made accretions to
<div n="lb"/>the original work ‘Jaya’ of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>Viewed with these facts we are led to believe that
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa has composed only the very essence of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata comprising 8800 ślokas and that work was
<div n="lb"/>known as ‘Jaya’ as referred to in the first invocatory
<div n="lb"/>verse of the epic. Vaiśampāyana added a few verses of
<div n="lb"/>his own and brought the number to 24,000 and gave the
<div n="lb"/>book the name of ‘Bhāratasaṃhitā’. It was Sūta who
<div n="lb"/>made many more additions and made the book so big
<div n="lb"/>as to fetch it the name of ‘Mahābhārata’. The epic
<div n="lb"/>which is now current among us contains a lakh of
<div n="lb"/>verses and it took perhaps centuries to get this transfor-
<div n="lb"/>mation of the book from ‘Jaya’ to ‘Mahābhārata’.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Period of publication.%} The Kali Varṣa starts from
<div n="lb"/>3102 B.C. The great Mahābhārata war was fought at
<div n="lb"/>a period when the end of Dvāpara yuga merged into
<div n="lb"/>the dawn of Kali yuga as could be gathered from the
<div n="lb"/>following verse from the epic:
<Poem>Antare caiva samprāpte
<div n="lb"/>Kalidvāparayorabhūt /
<div n="lb"/>Samantapañcake yuddhaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Kurupāṇḍavasenayoḥ. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 13, Chapter 2, Ādi Parva).
<div n="lb"/>So it can be deduced that the great war was fought
<div n="lb"/>round about 3102 B.C. Dhṛtarāṣṭra lived for eighteen
<div n="lb"/>years after the great battle and the Pāṇḍavas ruled the
<div n="lb"/>country for 36 years. (Strī Parva, M.B.). It was when
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa died that the Pāṇḍavas ended their rule
<div n="lb"/>and commenced the Mahāprasthāna. So it can be sur-
<div n="lb"/>mised that Śrī Kṛṣṇa lived for 36 years after the war.
[Page123-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa died on the first day of Kali yuga, 3102 B.C.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore it is clear the Mahābhārata battle was fought
<div n="lb"/>in 3138 B.C. There are indications in other purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>to support this theory. There was that rare phenomenon
<div n="lb"/>of a Saptagraha yoga (Combination in astronomical
<div n="lb"/>position of seven planets) while King Parīkṣit, son of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, was ruling the country.
<F>1. (a) Saptarṣayo maghāyuktāḥ kāle pārikṣite śatam (Matsya purāṇa 271. 46).
<div n="lb"/>(b) Te tu pārīkṣite kāle maghāsvāsan dvijottama (Visnu purāna 4, 24, 106).</F> This happened in a
<div n="lb"/>month of Māgha (January) and a probe into the dates
<div n="lb"/>of such previous occurrences revealed that a similar
<div n="lb"/>one had happened in the month of Māgha in the years
<div n="lb"/>3177 and 477 B.C. (The next one is to happen in 2223
<div n="lb"/>A.D.). This phenomenon repeats itself in every hundred
<div n="lb"/>years and so it is to be believed that one of the kind
<div n="lb"/>happened in 3077 B.C. precisely during the period of
<div n="lb"/>Parīkṣit. It is therefore confirmatory to the statement
<div n="lb"/>that the great war occurred in 3138 B.C.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas ruled the country for 36 years after the
<div n="lb"/>war and Vyāsa wrote this divine epic after the death
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas. Vyāsa took three years to complete
<div n="lb"/>his work. Therefore it can be well concluded that
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa wrote the epic in 3100 B.C. The Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>commenced their Mahāprasthāna after entrusting the
<div n="lb"/>administration of the state into the hands of Parīkṣit.
<div n="lb"/>This must have happened in 3102 B.C. Parīkṣit ruled
<div n="lb"/>the country for 60 years and so his son Janamejaya
<div n="lb"/>became King in 3042 B.C. It was after two years of
<div n="lb"/>his becoṃing King that he conducted the Sarpasatra
<div n="lb"/>and it was at this Sarpasatra that Vaiśampāyana first
<div n="lb"/>expounded ‘Jaya’ (Mahābhārata) to the sages assembl-
<div n="lb"/>ed there.
<div n="NI"/>This fixing of the date of Mahābhārata is based on the
<div n="lb"/>conclusions arrived at by the pandits of Bhārata, but
<div n="lb"/>foreign chronologists differ from us. They argue that
<div n="lb"/>it was in the 10th century B.C. that the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>battle took place on the strength of the following:
<div n="NI"/>The theme of the Mahābhārata is a fight between
<div n="lb"/>Kurus and Pāñcālas. After the war the two join and
<div n="lb"/>there is a statement in the Yajurveda of a people
<div n="lb"/>formed by the merger of the two. Therefore the great
<div n="lb"/>war should have happened in the 10th century B.C. It
<div n="lb"/>was a period of hero-worship and songs on the heroic
<div n="lb"/>deeds of the Kurus and Pāṇḍavas were sung and
<div n="lb"/>handed over from one generation to the other and
<div n="lb"/>gradually those songs took shape in the form of the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>There is another school of thought. In the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Brahmā is given great prominence. But in
<div n="lb"/>Vedic times Brahmā was not counted at all. During
<div n="lb"/>the golden period of the Buddhists Brahmā had a cons-
<div n="lb"/>picuous hold on Hinduism. Therefore it should be
<div n="lb"/>deduced that the Mahābhārata was written during the
<div n="lb"/>6th century B.C. Then there were about 8,000 verses
<div n="lb"/>in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>Towards the second stage of Mahābhārata the epic
<div n="lb"/>grew in size bringing into its fold about 24,000 ślokas.
<div n="lb"/>It was at this stage that the Mahābhārata got a vaiṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vite colour and Śrī Kṛṣṇa was adored as an incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu. Megasthenes who visited India in 300 B.C.
<div n="lb"/>records that the majority of Hindus were vaiṣṇavites
<div n="lb"/>at that period. There are references in certain parts
[Page123-b+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>of the Mahābhārata to Greeks and Buddhists. There-
<div n="lb"/>fore a set of foreign chronologists conclude that those
<div n="lb"/>portions of the Mahābhārata could have been written
<div n="lb"/>only after Buddha and after the attack on Bhārata by
<div n="lb"/>the Greeks i.e. by 300 B.C.
<div n="NI"/>The third stage of the Mahābhārata is its present form
<div n="lb"/>and it was at this stage that it included new philosophy
<div n="lb"/>in it. The Dharmasaṃhitā of Manusmṛti became popular
<div n="lb"/>in the fifth century A.D. and therefore the third stage
<div n="lb"/>of the Mahābhārata must have started before that, in
<div n="lb"/>the 3rd century A.D.
