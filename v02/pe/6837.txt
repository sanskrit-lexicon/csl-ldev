SUBĀHU¦ XIV. A Cola King. A great devotee of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, the King performed many yajñas. Though he
<div n="lb"/>lived according to the spiritual advice of his precep-
<div n="lb"/>tor Jaimini he was denied the sight of Viṣṇu. Ultimate-
<div n="lb"/>ly Subāhu and his queen attained heaven as they
<div n="lb"/>listened to Vijvala, their second son, reciting hymns
<div n="lb"/>addressed to Vāsudeva. (Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmi
<div n="lb"/>Khaṇḍa, Chapter 94).
<div n="NI"/>Though Subāhu and his queen worshipped Viṣṇu for a
<div n="lb"/>long time in the Ānanda forest, the lord did not appear
<div n="lb"/>to them. Ultimately they forsook their bodies in the
<div n="lb"/>forest and after a very long walk came to the abode of
<div n="lb"/>munis. The king queried them as to why he failed to see
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu though he performed penance for a very long time.
<div n="lb"/>The King and queen were done up due to hunger and
<div n="lb"/>thirst and the munis asked them to return to Ānandāś-
<div n="lb"/>rama and eat the corpses left there. While they
<div n="lb"/>were accordingly eating the corpses, Vijvala ques-
<div n="lb"/>tioned Kuñjala a bird which lived nearby, why his
<div n="lb"/>parents were eating dead bodies. The bird answered
<div n="lb"/>that when the King and queen had recited the praises
<div n="lb"/>of Vāsudeva they would see Viṣṇu. It also taught Vij-
<div n="lb"/>vala songs in praise of Viṣṇu. After having studied
<div n="lb"/>the songs, Vijvala went and sat on a tree at ānandāś-
<div n="lb"/>rama and sang the songs. Subāhu and his queen repeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed them and immediately Viṣṇu appeared before them
<div n="lb"/>and conducted them to heaven.
