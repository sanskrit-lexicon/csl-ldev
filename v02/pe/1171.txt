BHOJA V¦. A king of Kānyakubja. Once this king Bhoja
<div n="lb"/>met a woman with a fantastic shape. Her body was of
[Page139-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>human shape while her face was that of a female deer.
<div n="lb"/>When the king asked her about her strange shape, she
<div n="lb"/>related her past history as follows:—“In my previous
<div n="lb"/>birth, I was a female deer. On one occasion the whole
<div n="lb"/>of my body except my face, was plunged in a river and
<div n="lb"/>those parts of the body under the water were transformed
<div n="lb"/>into human shape. From that day, I have been changed
<div n="lb"/>into this form.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing her story, the king took her to the holy river
<div n="lb"/>and immersed her again in it. She was at once trans-
<div n="lb"/>formed into an actual woman and the king married her.
<div n="lb"/>(Skanda Purāṇa, 7-2-2).
