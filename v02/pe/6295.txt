SARASVATĪ I¦. Goddess of learning.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Sarasvati is the daughter of Brahmā.
Kāmadeva was born from Brahmā's heart; Krodha
(anger) was born from his eyebrows; Lobha, from his
lower lip, Sarasvatī, from his face; the Sindhus from
his genitals, and Nirṛti, from his anus.
<div n="NI"/>The following story about the birth of Sarasvatī is
from Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 43:—
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā got ready for creation, and while in meditation
sattvaguṇa (sublime quality) began swelling up in his
mind wherefrom a girl was born. Brahmā asked her
who she was. She answered: “I am born from you.
You fix for me a seat and duties.” Then Brahmā told
her that her name was Sarasvatī and ordained that she
should stay on the tip of everybody's tongue. You
dance especially on the tongues of learned people. You
should also exist on earth in the form of a river, and
assuming a third form you should live in me too.”
Sarasvatī agreed to this.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse of Sarasvatī.%} See under Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Misled Kumbhakarṇa.%} When Kumbhakarṇa requested
Brahmā for a boon, Sarasvatī, at the instance of the
latter, lodged herself in the tongue of Kumbhakarṇa and
made him ask for Nidrāvatva (Sleep), something dif-
ferent from what he really desired to get Viz. Nir-
devatva (absence of Devas).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Received Baḍavāgni.%} (all-consuming fire). Baḍavāgni
was born at the quarrel between the Bhārgavas and
Hehayas. Baḍavāgni is flames of Aurva, the Bhārgava.
(See under Aurva). It was Sarasvatī who took the
Agni to the ocean. As a result of this, Sarasvatī, be-
came a river in India. The story is told in the Sṛṣṭi-
khaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>The world was about to be burnt in Baḍavāgni, which
originated from Aurva, when Indra requested Sarasvatī
thus: “Oh! Devi! you should deposit this agni in the
western ocean; or else the world will be consumed in
its flames.” To this Sarasvatī told Viṣṇu as follows:
“I am not a free person. I will do nothing without the
permission of my father. Therefore, please think
of some other means.”
<div n="NI"/>The Devas, who understood Sarasvatī's nature, went
to Brahmā with their case. Immediately he called
Sarasvatī to him and asked her to deposit Baḍavāgni
in the western ocean for the safety of himself and the
Devas. Unable to disobey her father, Sarasvatī, with
tears in her eyes, agreed to do so. Then Gaṅgā followed
her and she told the former that she (Gaṅgā) would
[Page695-b+ 65]
see her flowing northwards when she reached the eastern
region surrounded by Devas.
<div n="NI"/>Sarasvatī sent back her companions like Gaṅgā, Yamunā
Manoramā, Gāyatrī and Sāvitrī who followed her. Then
she appeared at the āśrama of Uttaṅka under the
Plakṣa tree in the presence of the Devas. Just as Śiva
carried Gaṅgā, the Plakṣa tree bore Sarasvatī and
immediately did Śiva give to her Baḍavāgni in a pot.
Because of his blessing the agni did not burn her hands.
She went towards the north with the pot and came
to Puṣkariṇī, and she stopped there to redeem the
sins of people. It is believed to this very day that those
who drink water from the Puṣkara will attain Brahma-
loka.
<div n="NI"/>From Puṣkara Sarasvatī flowed towards the west and
reaching a date-garden not far off from Puṣkara it rose
up again where Sarasvatī is known as Nandā as well.
There is also another reason for the name Nandā.
Once upon a time there was a King called Prabhañjana.
While hunting in the forest he saw a deer inside a
cluster of shrubs and he shot an arrow at it. Then the
deer told the King: “What a crime is this! You have
wounded me, who am feeding my child. I have heard
that the King shall not kill a deer while it is engaged
in drinking, sleeping or mating. May you, who have done
this cruel act, be transformed into a tiger and roam
about this thorny forest.” Saying again and again
that he did not notice that the deer was feeding its
child, the King begged for absolution from the curse.
Taking pity on the weeping king the deer told him that
he would be redeemed from the curse when he had
talked with the cow called Nandā, which would go there
after a hundred years.
<div n="NI"/>According to the above curse the king got transformed
into a tiger and spent hundred years eating wild
animals. After hundred years were over a herd of cows
came there grazing under the leadership of a cow called
Nandā. Beautiful Nandā used to walk ahead of the
other cows and graze alone at a secret place in the
forest. There was a mountain called Rohita there, on
the banks of the river. The northern side of the mountain
was a dense forest infested by cruel animals. There
lived there a very cruel and terrible tiger as big as a
mountain. A generous person called Nanda was feed-
ing the cows with grass etc. Nandā, the cow, got separ-
ated from the herd and came to the river when the
tiger ran after it asking it to stop. Crying aloud the
cow said: Oh tiger; I have a child, which has not
begun even tasting grass and it is awaiting the return of
its mother to the cow-shed at dusk. I shall go and take
leave of the child and return so that you may eat me.”
<div n="NI"/>Taking pity on the cow the tiger granted its prayer. It
returned duly to the tiger at dusk. The tiger, taken by
surprise, by the honesty of the cow enquired of it its
name, and the cow answered that it was named Nandā
by its master, Nanda. As soon as the name was uttered
Prabhañjana was released from his old curse and he
became the former king. Dharmadeva then appeared
there and asked her to choose the boon she liked and
she replied as follows:—“I, with my child, must attain
the ultimate place and position, and let this place
become a sacred place for munis. Also, let this river
Sarasvatī, come to be known as Nandā, by my name.”
<div n="NI"/>Nandā immediately ascended to heaven and Prabhañ-
jana returned to his palace. River Sarasvatī came to be
[Page696-a+ 65]
called Nandā from that day: After flowing through the
above-mentioned date-garden towards the south for some
distance Sarasvatī (Nandā) flowed again towards the
north. She reached the ocean and deposited therein the
pot of Baḍavāgni. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Sarasvatī as Brahmā's wife.%} The Purāṇas mention
three wives of Brahmā, Sarasvatī, Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī.
But, the three are, according to Matsya Purāṇa, one
and the same person. The Matsya Purāṇa mentions:—
Brahmā created, from his own effulgence, a woman,
who became famous under the names Śatarūpā, Sāvitrī,
Gāyatrī and Brahmāṇī. Brahmā fell in love with his
daughter and noticing the fact she turned away to the right
side of her father. Then did a face appear on his right
side. To avoid the amorous looks of the father, she
slided off to both his sides, and faces appeared on those
sides of Brahmā. Then Sarasvatī jumped up to the sky
and a fifth face appeared on his head, turned upwards.
Finding escape impossible she yielded to the desire of
Brahmā and they enjoyed honey-moon for a hundred
years. To them was born a son called Svāyambhuva or
Virāṭ.
<div n="NI"/>At one place in Skanda Purāṇa, Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī
are referred to as different individuals. (See under
Sāvitrī).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Idol of Sarasvatī.%} Sarasvatī, clad in white clothes,
sits on a white lotus. She holds in her hands a string of
beads, book and Vīṇā. She is depicted in sitting, stand-
ing and dancing postures. She is conceived as Śakti
related to Viṣṇu as also to Śiva. In certain old works
in Bengal, Sarasvatī, instead of Bhūmidevī, is to be seen
along with Viṣṇu. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 50, enjoins
that idols of Sarasvatī in temple should hold in its
hands book, string of beads and Vīṇā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) It was on the banks of Sarasvatī that Vyāsa per-
formed tapas and Śuka was born. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) There are various references to Sarasvatī in the
Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Sarasvatī shines forth in Indra's court. (Sabhā
Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once Sarasvatī advised the muni called Tārkṣya
(Vana Parva, Chapter 185).
<div n="NI"/>(v) During Tripuradahana (burning of the city of the
Tripuras) Sarasvatī served as a passage for the chariot
of Śiva to advance. (Karṇa Parva, Chapter 34, Verse
34).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Muni Yājñavalkya once thought of Sarasvatī and
she appeared before him wearing ornaments of vowels
and consonants and sounding ‘Om’. (Śānti Parva,
Chapter 318, Verse 14).
