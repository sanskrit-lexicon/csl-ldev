SARASVATĪ I¦. Goddess of learning.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Sarasvati is the daughter of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva was born from Brahmā's heart; Krodha
<div n="lb"/>(anger) was born from his eyebrows; Lobha, from his
<div n="lb"/>lower lip, Sarasvatī, from his face; the Sindhus from
<div n="lb"/>his genitals, and Nirṛti, from his anus.
<div n="NI"/>The following story about the birth of Sarasvatī is
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 43:—
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā got ready for creation, and while in meditation
<div n="lb"/>sattvaguṇa (sublime quality) began swelling up in his
<div n="lb"/>mind wherefrom a girl was born. Brahmā asked her
<div n="lb"/>who she was. She answered: “I am born from you.
<div n="lb"/>You fix for me a seat and duties.” Then Brahmā told
<div n="lb"/>her that her name was Sarasvatī and ordained that she
<div n="lb"/>should stay on the tip of everybody's tongue. You
<div n="lb"/>dance especially on the tongues of learned people. You
<div n="lb"/>should also exist on earth in the form of a river, and
<div n="lb"/>assuming a third form you should live in me too.”
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī agreed to this.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse of Sarasvatī.%} See under Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Misled Kumbhakarṇa.%} When Kumbhakarṇa requested
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā for a boon, Sarasvatī, at the instance of the
<div n="lb"/>latter, lodged herself in the tongue of Kumbhakarṇa and
<div n="lb"/>made him ask for Nidrāvatva (Sleep), something dif-
<div n="lb"/>ferent from what he really desired to get Viz. Nir-
<div n="lb"/>devatva (absence of Devas).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Received Baḍavāgni.%} (all-consuming fire). Baḍavāgni
<div n="lb"/>was born at the quarrel between the Bhārgavas and
<div n="lb"/>Hehayas. Baḍavāgni is flames of Aurva, the Bhārgava.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Aurva). It was Sarasvatī who took the
<div n="lb"/>Agni to the ocean. As a result of this, Sarasvatī, be-
<div n="lb"/>came a river in India. The story is told in the Sṛṣṭi-
<div n="lb"/>khaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>The world was about to be burnt in Baḍavāgni, which
<div n="lb"/>originated from Aurva, when Indra requested Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>thus: “Oh! Devi! you should deposit this agni in the
<div n="lb"/>western ocean; or else the world will be consumed in
<div n="lb"/>its flames.” To this Sarasvatī told Viṣṇu as follows:
<div n="lb"/>“I am not a free person. I will do nothing without the
<div n="lb"/>permission of my father. Therefore, please think
<div n="lb"/>of some other means.”
<div n="NI"/>The Devas, who understood Sarasvatī's nature, went
<div n="lb"/>to Brahmā with their case. Immediately he called
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī to him and asked her to deposit Baḍavāgni
<div n="lb"/>in the western ocean for the safety of himself and the
<div n="lb"/>Devas. Unable to disobey her father, Sarasvatī, with
<div n="lb"/>tears in her eyes, agreed to do so. Then Gaṅgā followed
<div n="lb"/>her and she told the former that she (Gaṅgā) would
[Page695-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>see her flowing northwards when she reached the eastern
<div n="lb"/>region surrounded by Devas.
<div n="NI"/>Sarasvatī sent back her companions like Gaṅgā, Yamunā
<div n="lb"/>Manoramā, Gāyatrī and Sāvitrī who followed her. Then
<div n="lb"/>she appeared at the āśrama of Uttaṅka under the
<div n="lb"/>Plakṣa tree in the presence of the Devas. Just as Śiva
<div n="lb"/>carried Gaṅgā, the Plakṣa tree bore Sarasvatī and
<div n="lb"/>immediately did Śiva give to her Baḍavāgni in a pot.
<div n="lb"/>Because of his blessing the agni did not burn her hands.
<div n="lb"/>She went towards the north with the pot and came
<div n="lb"/>to Puṣkariṇī, and she stopped there to redeem the
<div n="lb"/>sins of people. It is believed to this very day that those
<div n="lb"/>who drink water from the Puṣkara will attain Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>loka.
<div n="NI"/>From Puṣkara Sarasvatī flowed towards the west and
<div n="lb"/>reaching a date-garden not far off from Puṣkara it rose
<div n="lb"/>up again where Sarasvatī is known as Nandā as well.
<div n="lb"/>There is also another reason for the name Nandā.
<div n="lb"/>Once upon a time there was a King called Prabhañjana.
<div n="lb"/>While hunting in the forest he saw a deer inside a
<div n="lb"/>cluster of shrubs and he shot an arrow at it. Then the
<div n="lb"/>deer told the King: “What a crime is this! You have
<div n="lb"/>wounded me, who am feeding my child. I have heard
<div n="lb"/>that the King shall not kill a deer while it is engaged
<div n="lb"/>in drinking, sleeping or mating. May you, who have done
<div n="lb"/>this cruel act, be transformed into a tiger and roam
<div n="lb"/>about this thorny forest.” Saying again and again
<div n="lb"/>that he did not notice that the deer was feeding its
<div n="lb"/>child, the King begged for absolution from the curse.
<div n="lb"/>Taking pity on the weeping king the deer told him that
<div n="lb"/>he would be redeemed from the curse when he had
<div n="lb"/>talked with the cow called Nandā, which would go there
<div n="lb"/>after a hundred years.
<div n="NI"/>According to the above curse the king got transformed
<div n="lb"/>into a tiger and spent hundred years eating wild
<div n="lb"/>animals. After hundred years were over a herd of cows
<div n="lb"/>came there grazing under the leadership of a cow called
<div n="lb"/>Nandā. Beautiful Nandā used to walk ahead of the
<div n="lb"/>other cows and graze alone at a secret place in the
<div n="lb"/>forest. There was a mountain called Rohita there, on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the river. The northern side of the mountain
<div n="lb"/>was a dense forest infested by cruel animals. There
<div n="lb"/>lived there a very cruel and terrible tiger as big as a
<div n="lb"/>mountain. A generous person called Nanda was feed-
<div n="lb"/>ing the cows with grass etc. Nandā, the cow, got separ-
<div n="lb"/>ated from the herd and came to the river when the
<div n="lb"/>tiger ran after it asking it to stop. Crying aloud the
<div n="lb"/>cow said: Oh tiger; I have a child, which has not
<div n="lb"/>begun even tasting grass and it is awaiting the return of
<div n="lb"/>its mother to the cow-shed at dusk. I shall go and take
<div n="lb"/>leave of the child and return so that you may eat me.”
<div n="NI"/>Taking pity on the cow the tiger granted its prayer. It
<div n="lb"/>returned duly to the tiger at dusk. The tiger, taken by
<div n="lb"/>surprise, by the honesty of the cow enquired of it its
<div n="lb"/>name, and the cow answered that it was named Nandā
<div n="lb"/>by its master, Nanda. As soon as the name was uttered
<div n="lb"/>Prabhañjana was released from his old curse and he
<div n="lb"/>became the former king. Dharmadeva then appeared
<div n="lb"/>there and asked her to choose the boon she liked and
<div n="lb"/>she replied as follows:—“I, with my child, must attain
<div n="lb"/>the ultimate place and position, and let this place
<div n="lb"/>become a sacred place for munis. Also, let this river
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī, come to be known as Nandā, by my name.”
<div n="NI"/>Nandā immediately ascended to heaven and Prabhañ-
<div n="lb"/>jana returned to his palace. River Sarasvatī came to be
[Page696-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>called Nandā from that day: After flowing through the
<div n="lb"/>above-mentioned date-garden towards the south for some
<div n="lb"/>distance Sarasvatī (Nandā) flowed again towards the
<div n="lb"/>north. She reached the ocean and deposited therein the
<div n="lb"/>pot of Baḍavāgni. (Padma Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Sarasvatī as Brahmā's wife.%} The Purāṇas mention
<div n="lb"/>three wives of Brahmā, Sarasvatī, Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī.
<div n="lb"/>But, the three are, according to Matsya Purāṇa, one
<div n="lb"/>and the same person. The Matsya Purāṇa mentions:—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā created, from his own effulgence, a woman,
<div n="lb"/>who became famous under the names Śatarūpā, Sāvitrī,
<div n="lb"/>Gāyatrī and Brahmāṇī. Brahmā fell in love with his
<div n="lb"/>daughter and noticing the fact she turned away to the right
<div n="lb"/>side of her father. Then did a face appear on his right
<div n="lb"/>side. To avoid the amorous looks of the father, she
<div n="lb"/>slided off to both his sides, and faces appeared on those
<div n="lb"/>sides of Brahmā. Then Sarasvatī jumped up to the sky
<div n="lb"/>and a fifth face appeared on his head, turned upwards.
<div n="lb"/>Finding escape impossible she yielded to the desire of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and they enjoyed honey-moon for a hundred
<div n="lb"/>years. To them was born a son called Svāyambhuva or
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭ.
<div n="NI"/>At one place in Skanda Purāṇa, Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī
<div n="lb"/>are referred to as different individuals. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Idol of Sarasvatī.%} Sarasvatī, clad in white clothes,
<div n="lb"/>sits on a white lotus. She holds in her hands a string of
<div n="lb"/>beads, book and Vīṇā. She is depicted in sitting, stand-
<div n="lb"/>ing and dancing postures. She is conceived as Śakti
<div n="lb"/>related to Viṣṇu as also to Śiva. In certain old works
<div n="lb"/>in Bengal, Sarasvatī, instead of Bhūmidevī, is to be seen
<div n="lb"/>along with Viṣṇu. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 50, enjoins
<div n="lb"/>that idols of Sarasvatī in temple should hold in its
<div n="lb"/>hands book, string of beads and Vīṇā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) It was on the banks of Sarasvatī that Vyāsa per-
<div n="lb"/>formed tapas and Śuka was born. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) There are various references to Sarasvatī in the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Sarasvatī shines forth in Indra's court. (Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once Sarasvatī advised the muni called Tārkṣya
<div n="lb"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 185).
<div n="NI"/>(v) During Tripuradahana (burning of the city of the
<div n="lb"/>Tripuras) Sarasvatī served as a passage for the chariot
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva to advance. (Karṇa Parva, Chapter 34, Verse
<div n="lb"/>34).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Muni Yājñavalkya once thought of Sarasvatī and
<div n="lb"/>she appeared before him wearing ornaments of vowels
<div n="lb"/>and consonants and sounding ‘Om’. (Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 318, Verse 14).
