MAYŪRADHVAJA¦. A King of Ratnanagara. After per-
forming seven Aśvamedha yāgas this King started
another Aśvamedha in the Narmadā river valley. The
task of protecting the sacrificial horse was undertaken
by the King's son Sucitra or Tāmradhvaja. He set out
for the conquest of the world with the chief minister
Bahudhvaja. On his return, he came across Yudhiṣṭhira's
Aśvamedha horse at the city of Maṇipur. The heroic
Sucitra encountered Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who were
leading the horse. After making them unconscious,
he entered the city with the sacrificial horse.
<div n="NI"/>When they recovered their senses, Śrī Kṛṣṇa disguised
himself as a Brāhmaṇa and Arjuna as a Brāhmaṇa boy
and they went to Mayūradhvaja's palace. The King
welcomed them respectfully. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, in his disguise
as Brāhmaṇa told the King that he was coming from
Dharmapurī to meet the King's priest, Kṛṣṇa who was
to officiate at the marriage of his (Brāhmaṇa's) son. He
added that unfortunately on his way through a forest
a lion caught hold of his son. Although he prayed to
Lord Narasiṃha, the boy could not be rescued. The
lion told him that he would release his son, if the
Brāhmaṇa persuaded Mayūradhvaja to offer one half of
his body as food to the lion.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing the Brāhmaṇa's story, Mayūradhvaja agreed
to give half of his body to the lion. Just then his queen
Kumudvatī appeared before them and said, “I am the
left half (Vāmabhāga) of the King. You may take me
and offer me as food for the lion.” But the Brāhmaṇa
replied that the lion wanted the right half of the King's
body.
<div n="NI"/>When the King heard this, he readily agreed to give the
right half of his own body. Accordingly, they started
cutting his body into two halves. Just then, seeing tears
coming down from Mayūradhvaja's left eye, the Brāh-
maṇa said:—“I find that you are in great sorrow; I do
not wish to accept a gift which is not given whole-
heartedly.” Mayūradhvaja explained that his tears were
not caused by pain or sorrow. His left side was dis-
appointed in not being able to be of as much service as
the right side.
<div n="NI"/>When Śrī Kṛṣṇa heard these words of the King, he
resumed his own shape and embraced him and blessed
him. After that Mayūradhvaja completed his yāga and
started with Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, taking Yudhiṣṭhira's
sacrificial horse with them. (Jaimini; Aśvamedha:
41-46).
