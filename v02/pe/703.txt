ĀHUKA¦. A king of Yadu Vaṃśa. He was the father of
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena, the father of Kaṃsa. (Some Purāṇas say
<div n="lb"/>that Āhuka and Ugrasena were the names of the same
<div n="lb"/>person). For genealogy, see “YADU VAṂŚA”. In M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 33, we find that

<div n="lb"/>Āhuka had a hundred sons. (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>14, Verse 56). There were constant quarrels between
