ĀHUKA¦. A king of Yadu Vaṃśa. He was the father of
Ugrasena, the father of Kaṃsa. (Some Purāṇas say
that Āhuka and Ugrasena were the names of the same
person). For genealogy, see “YADU VAṂŚA”. In M.B.,
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 33, we find that
Akrūra had married Sutanū, the daughter of Āhuka.
Āhuka had a hundred sons. (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter
14, Verse 56). There were constant quarrels between
Āhuka and Akrūra. (M.B., Śānti Parva, Chapter 81,
Verses 8-11).
