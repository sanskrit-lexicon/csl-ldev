AIRĀVATA I¦. A large elephant, son of Irāvatī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in this order:—
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu-Brahmā-Kaśyapa-Bhadramatā-Irāvatī-Airā-
<div n="lb"/>vata. Kaśyapa married Dakṣa's daughter, Krodhavaśā
<div n="lb"/>who bore him ten daughters. They were: Mṛgī, Mṛga-
<div n="lb"/>mandā, Harī, Bhadramatā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Svetā,
<div n="lb"/>Surabhī, Sarasā and Kadru. Of these Bhadramatā had
<div n="lb"/>a daughter named Irāvatī and Airāvata was her son.
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata was not human in shape; he was a large ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant. (See Sarga 14, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indra's Vāhana.%} Indra made Airāvata his conveyance
<div n="lb"/>(vāhana). Indra was Kaśyapa's son by Aditi. Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>also was descended from Kaśyapa. So Indra took
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata as his vāhana.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Airāvata caused the churning of the ocean of Milk.%} There
<div n="lb"/>is a story of how Airāvata was responsible for the churn-
<div n="lb"/>ing of the milk-ocean (Kṣīrābdhi-mathanam). Once
<div n="lb"/>some maidens of devaloka presented a garland of flowers
<div n="lb"/>to sage Durvāsas. When Durvāsas visited Indra's court
<div n="lb"/>he gave that garland to Indra. Indra put it on the tusks
<div n="lb"/>of his vāhana, Airāvata. The fragrance of the flowers
<div n="lb"/>attracted a swarm of bees which became an intolerable
<div n="lb"/>nuisance to Airāvata. So Airāvata tore the garland off
<div n="lb"/>his tusks and hurled it away. When Durvāsas heard
<div n="lb"/>this, he took it as an insult. In his anger he cursed all the
<div n="lb"/>gods—the curse was that all gods should become subject
<div n="lb"/>to old age and the decrepitude and infirmities of old age.
<div n="lb"/>But though Durvāsas cursed the gods, he also prescribed
<div n="lb"/>a remedy. The gods could redeem themselves from the
<div n="lb"/>curse by drinking Amṛtam obtained from the ocean of
<div n="lb"/>Milk (Mahāviṣṇu lies on the serpent, Śeṣa on this ocean).
<div n="lb"/>The curse began to operate and the gods lost their peren-
<div n="lb"/>nial youth. The gods then befriended the Asuras and
<div n="lb"/>with their help they churned the ocean of Milk. They
<div n="lb"/>got the nectar (Amṛtam), drank it and regained their
<div n="lb"/>youth. (See under the word AMṚTAM).
<div n="NI"/>4) There is another story about Airāvata—A story of
<div n="lb"/>how he also rose out of the ocean of Milk. It is said that
<div n="lb"/>when the devas and asuras churned the ocean of Milk,
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata also came up along with the other good things.
<div n="lb"/>This story is narrated in the 18th Chapter of Ādi Parva
<div n="lb"/>of the Mahābhārata. The explanation given is that when
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas cursed the gods, Airāvata was oppressed with
<div n="lb"/>a sense of guilt because he was responsible for the curse.
<div n="lb"/>So he took refuge in the ocean of Milk and there started
<div n="lb"/>propitiating Mahāviṣṇu. There is however no warrant
<div n="lb"/>for such an explanation in the purāṇas. But the expla-
<div n="lb"/>nation sounds plausible because it explains the absence
<div n="lb"/>of Airāvata during the interval between Durvāsas's
<div n="lb"/>curse and the churning of the sea. Airāvata is represented
<div n="lb"/>as a white elephant. It is probable that he became white
<div n="lb"/>after his long residence in the ocean of Milk. This lends
<div n="lb"/>some additional plausibility to the above explanation.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Airāvata, the Lord of the elephant.%} In the Viṣṇu Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>we are told how Airāvata was made the chief of all ele-
<div n="lb"/>phants. When the Maharṣis had crowned Pṛthu as the
<div n="lb"/>sovereign King, Brahmā gave new posts of honour to
<div n="lb"/>many of the devas. He made SOMA (Moon) the lord
<div n="lb"/>of the Stars and Planets, of Brahmins, Yajñas and herbs.
<div n="lb"/>Kubera was made the overlord of all Kings; Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>was made the master of the seas and all water; Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>the lord of the Ādityas and Pāvaka (Fire) the lord of
[Page019-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>the Vasus. Along with these Brahmā made Airāvata the
<div n="lb"/>lord of all elephants. (Chapter 22, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The breaking of Airāvata's tusks.%} There is a story of how
<div n="lb"/>the tusks of Airāvata were broken narrated in the Āsura-
<div n="lb"/>kāṇḍa of Skanda Purāṇa. Once an asura (demon)
<div n="lb"/>named Śūrapadma attacked devaloka. A fierce battle
<div n="lb"/>ensued between the gods and asuras. In the course of
<div n="lb"/>this battle, Jayanta, Indra's son, was hit by an arrow
<div n="lb"/>and at once he fell dead. Enraged by this Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>rushed at Śūrapadma's chariot and shattered it to
<div n="lb"/>pieces. Airāvata then attacked Śūrapadma who broke his
<div n="lb"/>tusks and hurled him down to the earth. Airāvata lay
<div n="lb"/>paralysed for a long time; then he got up, retired to a
<div n="lb"/>forest and prayed to Lord Śiva. With the grace of Śiva
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata regained his lost tusks and was able to return
<div n="lb"/>to devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details about Airāvata.%} (1) There is a belief
<div n="lb"/>that Airāvata is one of the eight elephants guarding the
<div n="lb"/>eight zones of the universe. These eight elephants are
<div n="lb"/>called the Aṣṭadiggajas. Airāvata is supposed to guard
<div n="lb"/>the eastern zone. (Chapter 66, Ādi Parva, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Airāvata and three other diggajas are supposed to
<div n="lb"/>reside in Puṣkara Island. (Chapter 12, Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
