<div n="NI"/>The sound “Om” is called “Praṇava” or “Brahman.”
<div n="lb"/>All mantras begin with the sound ‘Om’. Because of its
<div n="lb"/>sacredness, Śūdras and other low-caste people are not
<div n="lb"/>allowed to utter it or to hear it. They may pronounce
<div n="lb"/>it only as “Aum.” This sound includes all that has
<div n="lb"/>happened and all that is to happen. (Māṇḍūkyo-
