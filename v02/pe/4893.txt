<div n="NI"/>The sound “Om” is called “Praṇava” or “Brahman.”
All mantras begin with the sound ‘Om’. Because of its
sacredness, Śūdras and other low-caste people are not
allowed to utter it or to hear it. They may pronounce
it only as “Aum.” This sound includes all that has
happened and all that is to happen. (Māṇḍūkyo-
paniṣad).
