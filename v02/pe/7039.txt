ŚUKRA¦ (ŚUKRĀCĀRYA) I. Preceptor of the Asuras.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Views differ as to whether Śukra was the
<div n="lb"/>son or grandson of Bhṛgu. The Purāṇas state that
<div n="lb"/>Pulomā was the wife of Bhṛgu. Śukra has another name,
<div n="lb"/>Kāvya. Kāvya means the son of Kavi. Some autho-
<div n="lb"/>rities say that Kavi was Bhṛgu's son, while others think
<div n="lb"/>that Kavi was Bhṛgu himself. Śukra's mother is re-
<div n="lb"/>ferred to as “Kāvyamātā” in many places. Śukra is re-
<div n="lb"/>ferred to as the strongest of the seven sons born to
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu and Pulomā. In the light of these references it
<div n="lb"/>is reasonable to consider Śukra as the son of the sage
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu. “Kavi” must be supposed to be another name
<div n="lb"/>of Bhṛgu. Uśanas was another name for Śukra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Love story.%} Once the sage Bhṛgu lived in the valley
<div n="lb"/>of Mandara mountain, performing austere tapas. Śukra
<div n="lb"/>who was then a boy, used to attend on his father. One
<div n="lb"/>day when Bhṛgu was absorbed in “Nirvikalpasamādhi”
<div n="lb"/>(deep meditation) the lonely Śukra was appreciating
<div n="lb"/>the beauty of the sky above him. There was no one
<div n="lb"/>else by his side. At that time he happened to see an
<div n="lb"/>exceptionally beautiful Apsarā woman passing across the
<div n="lb"/>sky. His heart was filled with delight at the sight. All
<div n="lb"/>his thoughts were centred on her and he sat absorbed
<div n="lb"/>in her bewitching charm. In his imagination he follow-
<div n="lb"/>ed Indra and reached Indraloka. Indra greeted him
<div n="lb"/>with honour. After that Śukra, attended by the hea-
<div n="lb"/>venly beings went about sight-seeing in Heaven. There
<div n="lb"/>he unexpectedly came across the Apsarā beauty whom
<div n="lb"/>he had seen earlier, in the midst of several other
<div n="lb"/>women. They fell in love at first sight. To fulfil his
<div n="lb"/>desire Śukra enveloped the whole place in darkness.
<div n="lb"/>The other women left the place. The apsarā beauty
<div n="lb"/>approached Śukra and both of them entered a hut form-
<div n="lb"/>ed by the thick foliage of creeping plants and indulged
<div n="lb"/>in sensual pleasures. Since Śukra spent a period of
<div n="lb"/>eight Caturyugas like this in her company, he became
<div n="lb"/>weak in his virtue and descended to the earth. Then
<div n="lb"/>he became conscious of his physical being. His depraved
<div n="lb"/>soul was stopped at the moon. It reached the earth
<div n="lb"/>through mist and grew up as paddy plants. A Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>who was a native of Daśārṇa land ate the rice which
<div n="lb"/>was cooked from the ears of those paddy plants. Śukra's
<div n="lb"/>soul in the shape of Śukra entered the womb of the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmana's wife and in due course took his birth.
<div n="lb"/>Because of his close association with Munis, that boy
<div n="lb"/>grew up like a sage and spent a period of one Manvan-
<div n="lb"/>tara, leading an austere life in the valley of the Meru
<div n="lb"/>mountain. At that time his Apsarā woman had been
<div n="lb"/>born as a female deer, as the result of a curse. By
<div n="lb"/>their connection in the previous birth, the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with that female deer and begot a human
<div n="lb"/>child by his union with her. With that the austerities
<div n="lb"/>of his life were at an end. All his thoughts were now
<div n="lb"/>directed towards the future glory of his son and he
<div n="lb"/>ignored even his spiritual duties. Not long after, he died
<div n="lb"/>of snake bite. Later, he was born as the son of the king
<div n="lb"/>of Madra and ruled the country for many years. After
<div n="lb"/>that he took birth in many other wombs and at last was
<div n="lb"/>born as the son of a Maharṣi living on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā. Śukra's body which was by the side of
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu dropped to the earth after being exposed to the
<div n="lb"/>wind and sun for a long time. But owing to Bhṛgu's
[Page760-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>power of tapas and the holiness of the āśrama, birds and
<div n="lb"/>animals did not eat the body. After 1,000 divyavatsaras,
<div n="lb"/>sage Bhṛgu opened his eyes from his samādhi but he did
<div n="lb"/>not find his son near him. A famished and worn out body
<div n="lb"/>was lying before him. Within the wrinkles of the skin,
<div n="lb"/>small birds were nesting and frogs took refuge in the
<div n="lb"/>hollow of the stomach. Enraged at the premature death
<div n="lb"/>of his son, he was about to curse Yama, the god of Death.
<div n="lb"/>Coming to know of this Dharmarāja (Yama) appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him and said:—“We honour and adore you as
<div n="lb"/>a great tapasvī. You should not ruin your tapas. I have
<div n="lb"/>devoured numerous Brahmāṇḍas. I have already swal-
<div n="lb"/>lowed Rudras and Viṣṇudevas many times. All of you
<div n="lb"/>are my food. It is ordained by Fate. Even Brahmā is not
<div n="lb"/>indestructible at the end of a Kalpa. Knowing all these
<div n="lb"/>facts, why do you think of cursing me? Your son fell
<div n="lb"/>into this state because of his own act. While you were in
<div n="lb"/>a state of Samādhi your son's mind left its body
<div n="lb"/>and went up to Heaven. There he spent many years in-
<div n="lb"/>dulging in sensual pleasures in the company of the
<div n="lb"/>celestial beauty Viśvācī. Then he was born as a Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa in Daśārṇa country. In his next birth he became
<div n="lb"/>the King of Kosala. After that passing through many
<div n="lb"/>births in succession he is now performing tapas on the
<div n="lb"/>bank of the river Samaṅgā as the son of a Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>under the name, Vāsudeva. Open your inner eye and
<div n="lb"/>see for yourself.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this Dharmarāja revived the body of Śukra
<div n="lb"/>who rose up and did obeisance to his father. (Jñāna-
<div n="lb"/>vāsiṣṭha, Sthitiprakaraṇam).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Domestic Life.%} It is seen that Śukra had several
<div n="lb"/>wives and children. In Devī Bhāgavata there is a story
<div n="lb"/>of Jayantī, daughter of Indra who was Śukra's wife for
<div n="lb"/>about ten years. (See under Jayantī II). Priyavrata, the
<div n="lb"/>brother of Uttānapāda had a daughter named Ūrjjasvatī
<div n="lb"/>by his wife Surūpā. In Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha
<div n="lb"/>it is stated that Śukrācārya married Ūrjjasvatī and he
<div n="lb"/>had a daughter Devayānī by her. Mahābhārata, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 65 mentions that Śukra was the ācārya
<div n="lb"/>(preceptor) of the Asuras and his four sons were the
<div n="lb"/>priests of the Asuras. Śukra had a daughter named
<div n="lb"/>“Arā”. (See under Arā). Besides, Śukra had another
<div n="lb"/>wife named Śataparvā.
<div n="NI"/>But no child was born to Śataparvā.
<div n="NI"/>Devī, wife of Varuṇa's elder brother, was a daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Śukra. Ūrjjasvatī was the most famous among Śukra's
<div n="lb"/>wives.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Revived his mother.%} See under Kāvyamātā.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Jamadagni was restored to life.%} See the 8th para under
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Śukra cursed Daṇḍa.%} See under Arā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Cursed Yayāti.%} See the 4th Para under Devayānī.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%How Śukra lost his eye.%} Śukrācārya lost one of his eyes
<div n="lb"/>during the time of Mahābali, the Asura King. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu incarnated as Vāmana and begged three feet of
<div n="lb"/>earth from Mahābali. Since Śukra tried to obstruct it,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu put out one of Śukra's eyes with the point of a
<div n="lb"/>a darbha grass. (For more details see 3rd Para under
<div n="lb"/>Mahābali).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śiva swallowed Śukra.%} Once Śukra invaded Kubera
<div n="lb"/>and plundered all his wealth. The distressed Kubera
<div n="lb"/>informed Śiva about it. Śiva at once started up with
<div n="lb"/>his weapon, shouting “Where is he?” Śukra appeared
<div n="lb"/>on the top of Śiva's trident. Śiva caught hold of him
<div n="lb"/>and swallowed him. Śukra who moved about in Śiva's
[Page761-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>stomach found the excessive heat there, unbearable and
<div n="lb"/>soon became exhausted. In his helpless state he began
<div n="lb"/>to worship Śiva for his mercy. At last Śiva permitted
<div n="lb"/>him to escape through his penis and Śukra thus came
<div n="lb"/>out. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 290).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once Śukrācārya had adorned the office of Educa-
<div n="lb"/>tion Minister of Mahiṣāsura. At that time Cikṣura
<div n="lb"/>was the War Minister, Tāmra was Financer Minister,
<div n="lb"/>Asiloma was the Prime Minister, Viḍāla was the Foreign
<div n="lb"/>Minister, Udarka was the Military Commander and
<div n="lb"/>Śukra was the Education Minister. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>5th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 51 states that Śukra should
<div n="lb"/>be installed in temples with his Kamaṇḍalu (a vessel
<div n="lb"/>for carrying water) and wearing his garland.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) At the time of the war between Devas and Asuras.

<div n="lb"/>Meru mountain. All precious stones are in the possession
<div n="lb"/>of Śukra. Even Kubera (the god of wealth) lives by
<div n="lb"/>borrowing one-fourth of Śukra's wealth. (M.B. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 22).
<div n="NI"/>(x) Śukra was among those who visited Bhīṣma as he
<div n="lb"/>lay on the bed of arrows. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>47, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>(xi) Once Śukrācārya was the priest of Emperor Pṛthu.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 110).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) On another occasion Śukra sent Indra to Prahlāda

<div n="lb"/>289, Verse 32).
