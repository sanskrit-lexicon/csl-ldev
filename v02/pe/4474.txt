MĀYĀDHARA¦. An asura. Indra got down Purūravas
to fight against this demon who was always giving
trouble to the devas. Purūravas killed Māyādhara in a
battle. The day the demon was killed Indra gave a
banquet in honour of Purūravas. After the banquet
there was a dance performance by Rambhā and as she
was dancing before Ācārya Tumburu, Purūravas openly
criticised Rambhā for the mistake in dancing she
committed then. Tumburu did not relish it and he
cursed Purūravas saying that Purūravas would bear a
separation from his wife Urvaśī. It was because of this
curse that Urvaśī was once carried away from the palace
of Purūravas by the Gandharvas. (Kathāsaritsāgara,
Taraṅga 3, Lāvāṇakalambaka).
