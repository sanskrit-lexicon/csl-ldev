MĀYĀDHARA¦. An asura. Indra got down Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>to fight against this demon who was always giving
<div n="lb"/>trouble to the devas. Purūravas killed Māyādhara in a
<div n="lb"/>battle. The day the demon was killed Indra gave a
<div n="lb"/>banquet in honour of Purūravas. After the banquet
<div n="lb"/>there was a dance performance by Rambhā and as she
<div n="lb"/>was dancing before Ācārya Tumburu, Purūravas openly
<div n="lb"/>criticised Rambhā for the mistake in dancing she
<div n="lb"/>committed then. Tumburu did not relish it and he
<div n="lb"/>cursed Purūravas saying that Purūravas would bear a
<div n="lb"/>separation from his wife Urvaśī. It was because of this
<div n="lb"/>curse that Urvaśī was once carried away from the palace
<div n="lb"/>of Purūravas by the Gandharvas. (Kathāsaritsāgara,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 3, Lāvāṇakalambaka).
