VṚṢADARBHA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} An ancient saintly King in
Bhārata. This King Vṛṣadarbha and another King
named Seduka were righteous as well as experts in
wielding main and subordinate weapons. After com-
pleting the education of Vedas, a brahmin once
approached King Seduka and begged as alms some
horses for giving gift to his teacher. The Brahmin said
“It is my wish that you will give me these horses as
alms.” Seduka said that he had not enough wealth or
horses to give the teacher's gift. Seduka sent the
Brahmin to Vṛṣadarbha. The Brahmin went to Vṛṣa-
darbha and begged as alms a thousand horses. The
King whipped the Brahmin. He asked the King why he
was punished as he had done no wrong. The King
asked the Brahmin who was beginning to curse. Ho.
Brahmin! Whom are you about to curse? Him who has
not given you alms or another Brahmin? The Brahmin
said. “O, King I am sent here by Seduka. I
begged as he had instructed.”
<div n="NI"/>The King said. “This evening I shall give you all the
tax-collection of this day. You who have been whipped
ought not to be sent emptyhanded.” Accordingly the
whole of the tax collection of that day was given to the
Brahmin. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 196).
