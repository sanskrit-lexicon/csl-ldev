TRIVAKRĀ¦. A hunchback of a woman who was en-
<div n="lb"/>gaged in the work of making scented cosmetics for
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa. This woman saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa on his way to the
<div n="lb"/>palace of his uncle Kaṃsa in Mathurāpurī. Even at
<div n="lb"/>the first sight she felt a great respect and devotion
<div n="lb"/>towards Kṛṣṇa and she gave him the scented cosmetics
<div n="lb"/>she was carrying to Kaṃsa. Kṛṣṇa placed a foot of
[Page796-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>his on hers and holding her chin by both the hands rais-
<div n="lb"/>ed it up and lo! she stood straight without her hunch.
<div n="lb"/>She requested Kṛṣṇa to stay with her that night but
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa left her saying he would stay with her on another
<div n="lb"/>day which he did the next day itself. (10th Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
