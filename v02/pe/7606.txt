TRIVAKRĀ¦. A hunchback of a woman who was en-
gaged in the work of making scented cosmetics for
Kaṃsa. This woman saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa on his way to the
palace of his uncle Kaṃsa in Mathurāpurī. Even at
the first sight she felt a great respect and devotion
towards Kṛṣṇa and she gave him the scented cosmetics
she was carrying to Kaṃsa. Kṛṣṇa placed a foot of

his on hers and holding her chin by both the hands rais-
ed it up and lo! she stood straight without her hunch.
She requested Kṛṣṇa to stay with her that night but
Kṛṣṇa left her saying he would stay with her on another
day which he did the next day itself. (10th Skandha,
Bhāgavata).
