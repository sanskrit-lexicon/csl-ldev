DEVAŚARMĀ VI¦. A Brahmin who lived on the nor-
<div n="lb"/>thern side of river Kāverī. The following story about
<div n="lb"/>him is told in chapters 2, 4 and 12 of the Skanda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>One day in the month of Kārttika he asked his son to
<div n="lb"/>bathe. The son refused to obey his father, who got
<div n="lb"/>angry at the disobedience of the son and cursed him to be
<div n="lb"/>turned into a rat. But, when the son begged his pardon
<div n="lb"/>he said that the boy would resume his old form when
<div n="lb"/>he heard about the greatness of Kārttika.
<div n="NI"/>While the Brahmin, thus turned into rat, was roaming
<div n="lb"/>about in the forest it saw Viśvāmitra maharṣi seated
<div n="lb"/>under a tree with his disciples. The maharṣi was telling
<div n="lb"/>the disciples about the greatness of Kārttika. The Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min boy—turned cat—heard the story and reverted to
<div n="lb"/>its old form as the Brahmin boy.
