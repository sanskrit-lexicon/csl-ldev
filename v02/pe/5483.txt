PUṆYAJANA¦. A rākṣasa. Raivata, king of Kuśasthalī,
born of the race of Śaryāti, went to see Brahmā. Taking
advantage of his absence from the place Puṇyajana
took control over Kuśasthalī. Afraid of the demon all
the hundred brothers of Raivata left the country. After
some time the Śaryāti dynasty merged with that of
Hehaya. (Chapter 2, Aṃśa 4, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
