VAJRĀYUDHA¦ (Thunderbolt). The famous weapon
<div n="lb"/>of Indra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The making of this weapon.%} In olden days a fierce
<div n="lb"/>asura named Vṛtra was born. The Kālakeyas and
<div n="lb"/>many other asuras became his followers. They began to
<div n="lb"/>create havoc in the world, and cause harm to the
<div n="lb"/>Devas. At last under the leadership of Indra, the Devas
<div n="lb"/>went to Brahmā and informed him of their grievances
<div n="lb"/>and requested for advice as to the way of killing Vṛtra.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā told them that only with a weapon made of the
<div n="lb"/>bone of the hermit Dadhīca, could Vṛtrāsura be killed.
<div n="lb"/>The Devas went to the bank of the river Śoṇa and saw
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Dadhīca, who was the foremost of munificent
<div n="lb"/>men, doing penance there. Indra told him the purpose
<div n="lb"/>of their visit. He told the Devas to take his bone, if it
<div n="lb"/>was useful to them. Saying this he forsook his body. The
<div n="lb"/>Devas took the bones of the hermit and gave them to
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā who made a powerful weapon with them
<div n="lb"/>and gave that to Indra. They named the weapon the
<div n="lb"/>‘thunderbolt.’ (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The face of Subrahmaṇya was cut.%} Once Indra was
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Narakāsura. He went to the Himālayas and
<div n="lb"/>hid himself there. Unable to see their King Indra, the
<div n="lb"/>devas went to Subrahmaṇya. When Indra knew this, he
<div n="lb"/>thought that Subrahmaṇya had taken possession of the
<div n="lb"/>world of the gods. So he came and fought with Su-
<div n="lb"/>brahmaṇya. The thunderbolt of Indra touched the face
<div n="lb"/>of Subrahmaṇya and wounded him. From the blood
<div n="lb"/>which flowed from the face of Subrahmaṇya two noble
<div n="lb"/>men appeared who eventually became warriors of
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 6).

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Daily thunderbolt.%} In Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 5 and Aṃśa 2, Chapter 8, a process by which
<div n="lb"/>thunderbolt is made daily in the evening from the water
<div n="lb"/>particles thrown by Brahmins when they recite the spell
<div n="lb"/>Gāyatrī, is described.
<div n="NI"/>In the evening, the fierce giants called the Mandehas
<div n="lb"/>wish to eat the Sun. Prajāpati had given them a curse
<div n="lb"/>that though their bodies would not perish they would
<div n="lb"/>daily meet with death. So there is a fight between these
<div n="lb"/>giants and the sun daily in the evening. At that time
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmins recite the spell Gāyatrī with the Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>pervading syllable ‘OM,’ and throw up water. This
<div n="lb"/>water becomes the Vajra weapon, and burns the giant.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The thunderbolt became a tiger.%} The hermits Nārada
<div n="lb"/>and Parvata once went to the palace of the King
<div n="lb"/>Sṛñjaya. The King worshipped them and served
<div n="lb"/>them for a long time, as a result of which a son was
<div n="lb"/>born to him. Indra decided to lessen the superior
<div n="lb"/>power of these hermits. Once the son of the King, who
<div n="lb"/>was a mere boy, was playing in the forest. At the in-
<div n="lb"/>struction of Indra, the thunderbolt took the form of a
<div n="lb"/>tiger and went to the forest and killed the boy. Sṛñjaya
<div n="lb"/>became very sad. Nārada and Parvata brought the boy
<div n="lb"/>to lite again and gave him to the King. (M.B. Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 30).
