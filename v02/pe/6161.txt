SAÑJAYA I¦. Minister of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Sañjaya, who was equal to a hermit, was
born as the son of Sūta from a portion of Gavalgaṇa.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 68, Verse 93).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The boon of Sañjaya.%} Sañjaya who was born within
the circle of the friends of the Kauravas, became the
minister of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. The great work that Sañjaya
did in Mahābhārata was, telling Dhṛtarāṣṭra every
thing that was taking place in the battle-field without
leaving even the smallest events in the order of their
occurrence. Sañjaya was able to do this because of
the boon granted by Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>When the armies of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas
pitched their camps on either side of the battlefield,
Vedavyāsa came to Hastināpura and saw Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
Dhṛtarāṣṭra heard about the preparations on either side
for the battle. He did not like to go to the battle-field
and see for himself the events of the battle. He said so to
Vyāsa. Then Vyāsa called Sañjaya to him and said
“Sañjaya shall see all the events of the battle directly.
He shall have such a divine inward eye.” Vyāsa con-
tinued. “O king! Sañjaya has inward eyes. He will tell
you everything about the battle. He will be knowing all.
Whenever he thinks of it he will see everything that
takes place in the day and in the night in open, and
in secret. No weapon will cut him and no weariness
will affect him. He is the son of Gavalgaṇa and will
come away unhurt from the battle.”
<div n="NI"/>Because of this blessing Sañjaya used to inform
Dhṛtarāṣṭra of all the events in the battle at the time
of the occurrence. Sañjaya informed Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the
news up to the death of Duryodhana. When
Duryodhana was killed the cry of Aśvatthāmā grew
louder. Sañjaya who heard this cry early in the
morning, ran to the battlefield with a broken heart.
With the death of Duryodhana the boon of inward eye
given to Sañjaya by Vyāsa was lost. (M.B. Bhīṣma
Parva, Chapter 2; Sauptika Parva, Chapter 9).
