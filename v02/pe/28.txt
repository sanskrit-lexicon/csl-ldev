ADHĪRA¦. A King; also a great devotee of Lord Śiva.
Once he decreed death penalty on an innocent woman.
He also destroyed with his own hands a temple of Śiva.
As a consequence of those two sinful deeds he became
a devil after death. Ultimately by the grace of Śiva
he cast off the devil's form and became an attendant of
Śiva. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 111).
