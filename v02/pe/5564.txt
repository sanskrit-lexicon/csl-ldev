PUṢPARĀGAPRĀKĀRA¦. (RATNAŚĀLĀ). The Purā-
ṇas state about a fort made of diamonds called Puṣpa-
rāga shining red above the heavenly place called
Maṇidvīpa above Brahmaloka. This fort is seven
yojanas high. All things inside it, the ground, the trees,
the birds, the animals, plants, creepers and gardens are
puṣparāga-studded and look red like saffron. Therefore
the fort is called Ratnaśālā also. All the dikpālakas of
the universe live with their family and attendants in
this fort. (12th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
