MAṆḌODARĪ I¦. (MANDODARĪ). (In South India
the name Maṇḍodarī is current). Wife of Rāvaṇa.
The Uttara Rāmāyaṇa contains a story about the
previous history of Mandodarī.
<div n="NI"/>Maya, an asura, was born to Kaśyapaprajāpati of his
wife Danu. Once Maya went to Devaloka to see the
dances of the celestial maidens there. Devas came to
know that Maya was in love with the nymph Hemā
and they married her to Maya. Maya went to the
southern valley of Himavān and lived there with Hemā
constructing there a city called Hemapura. They got
two sons Māyāvī and Dundubhi. But they grieved over
the lack of a daughter and she went to a side of
Himavān and started penance there to get the bless-
ings of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Once a celestial damsel named Madhurā after observing
Somavāravrata went to Kailāsa to pay obeisance to
Śiva. Pārvatī was absent from the place then, having
gone to attend the birthday celebrations of one of her
sons. So Madhurā met Śiva sitting lonely and this led to
a clandestine sexual union between them. When Pārvatī
returned she saw traces of the ashes from the body of
Śiva on the naked breast of Madhurā and Pārvatī in
her anger cursed Madhurā to live in a well for twelve
years as a frog. Śiva was stupefied at the curse and he
went to the well and consoled her by saying that she
would after the twelve years of life as a frog become
a very beautiful maiden and would be married by a
man of great fame and valour. It was near this well
that Maya and his wife were performing penance
to get a daughter.
<div n="NI"/>After twelve years the frog changed itself into a beauti-
ful maiden and cried loudly from the well. Hearing
the cry Maya and Hemā, who were nearby peeped into
the well and seeing the young girl took her home and
brought her up giving her the name Mandodarī. Rāvaṇa
returning after his victory march by that way visited
Maya and seeing the girl fell in love with her and
married her according to Vedic rites and took her to
Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa got three sons of her, Meghanāda,
Atikāya and Akṣakumāra.
<div n="NI"/>Mandodarī was a very beautiful woman. Hanūmān
when he entered the bed-room of Rāvaṇa in search of
Sītā was dumb-founded at the beauty of Mandodarī
and mistook her for a second for Sītā. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa).
