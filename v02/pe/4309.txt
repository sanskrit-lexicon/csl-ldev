MAṆḌODARĪ I¦. (MANDODARĪ). (In South India
<div n="lb"/>the name Maṇḍodarī is current). Wife of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="lb"/>The Uttara Rāmāyaṇa contains a story about the
<div n="lb"/>previous history of Mandodarī.
<div n="NI"/>Maya, an asura, was born to Kaśyapaprajāpati of his
<div n="lb"/>wife Danu. Once Maya went to Devaloka to see the
<div n="lb"/>dances of the celestial maidens there. Devas came to
<div n="lb"/>know that Maya was in love with the nymph Hemā
<div n="lb"/>and they married her to Maya. Maya went to the
<div n="lb"/>southern valley of Himavān and lived there with Hemā
<div n="lb"/>constructing there a city called Hemapura. They got
<div n="lb"/>two sons Māyāvī and Dundubhi. But they grieved over
<div n="lb"/>the lack of a daughter and she went to a side of
<div n="lb"/>Himavān and started penance there to get the bless-
<div n="lb"/>ings of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Once a celestial damsel named Madhurā after observing
<div n="lb"/>Somavāravrata went to Kailāsa to pay obeisance to
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Pārvatī was absent from the place then, having
<div n="lb"/>gone to attend the birthday celebrations of one of her
<div n="lb"/>sons. So Madhurā met Śiva sitting lonely and this led to
<div n="lb"/>a clandestine sexual union between them. When Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>returned she saw traces of the ashes from the body of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva on the naked breast of Madhurā and Pārvatī in
<div n="lb"/>her anger cursed Madhurā to live in a well for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years as a frog. Śiva was stupefied at the curse and he
<div n="lb"/>went to the well and consoled her by saying that she
<div n="lb"/>would after the twelve years of life as a frog become
<div n="lb"/>a very beautiful maiden and would be married by a
<div n="lb"/>man of great fame and valour. It was near this well
<div n="lb"/>that Maya and his wife were performing penance
<div n="lb"/>to get a daughter.
<div n="NI"/>After twelve years the frog changed itself into a beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful maiden and cried loudly from the well. Hearing
<div n="lb"/>the cry Maya and Hemā, who were nearby peeped into
<div n="lb"/>the well and seeing the young girl took her home and
<div n="lb"/>brought her up giving her the name Mandodarī. Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>returning after his victory march by that way visited
<div n="lb"/>Maya and seeing the girl fell in love with her and
<div n="lb"/>married her according to Vedic rites and took her to
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa got three sons of her, Meghanāda,
<div n="lb"/>Atikāya and Akṣakumāra.
<div n="NI"/>Mandodarī was a very beautiful woman. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>when he entered the bed-room of Rāvaṇa in search of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā was dumb-founded at the beauty of Mandodarī
<div n="lb"/>and mistook her for a second for Sītā. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa).
