<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other Details.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%i) Nala's incognito life.%} While Nala was wandering in
the dense forest after leaving Damayantī, he was bitten
by the serpent, Karkoṭaka. His complexion turned blue
owing to the effect of the poison. Karkoṭaka gave him
a garment by wearing which Nala could regain his form.
As advised by Karkoṭaka, Nala went to the palace of
Ṛtuparṇa, king of Ayodhyā, assuming the name
Bāhuka. He lived there as the chief charioteer of the
king. He had mastered the art “Aśvahṛdaya” by which
he could drive the chariot-horses with astonishing speed.
Ṛtuparṇa appointed him as his chief charioteer and gave
him two assistants, Vārṣṇeya and Jīvala. (M.B.,
Araṇya Parva, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>{%(ii) Ṛtuparṇa and the second marriage of Damayanti.%}
Damayantī came to know that Nala was living in Ṛtu-
parṇa's palace, through the messenger Parṇāda. She
[Page654-a+ 65]
sent a secret message to Ayodhyā through a Brāhmaṇa
named Sudeva that her second marriage was fixed for
the next day and that Ṛtuparṇa should attend the
ceremony. Ṛtuparṇa started at once with Bāhuka as his
charioteer. On the way, Ṛtuparṇa's cloak happened to
fall down from the chariot. At once he asked Nala to
stop the chariot. But he told him that within a moment,
the chariot had covered a distance of one yojana from
the place where the cloak fell.
<div n="NI"/>They saw a tree in the forest which was heavily laden
with fruit. Ṛtuparṇa was able to tell at a glance, the
exact number of leaves and fruits on that tree. He told
Nala that he was able to do so with the help of the art
“Akṣahṛdaya” and he taught it to Nala. In return for
it, Nala taught the king the art of Aśvahṛdaya. At last
they reached the city of Vidarbha. Damayantī managed
to recognize Nala even in his disguise. Ṛtuparṇa who
was happy over the reunion of Nala and Damayantī
returned to Ayodhyā on the next day. (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 77).
