<div n="lb"/>Snigdha had two sons, Prasena and Satrājit.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Prasena and the Syamantaka.%} Satrājit and Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>(Sun) were friends. Once Satrājit requested Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>to give him some gift as a token of their friendship.
<div n="lb"/>Then Sūrya gave him the Syamantaka gem. If that
<div n="lb"/>stone was worshipped daily with pūjās by brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>it would yield eight loads of gold daily. When once
<div n="lb"/>Satrājit travelled by air with that gem round his neck
<div n="lb"/>the people of Dvārakā mistook him for Viṣṇu. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa was attracted by the beauty and power of that
<div n="lb"/>stone and he asked Satrājit that gem for a good price.
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa offered as much money as he wanted and
<div n="lb"/>still Satrājit did not part with it.
<div n="NI"/>Once Prasena went hunting with that gem round his
<div n="lb"/>neck and he was attacked and killed by a lion. The
<div n="lb"/>lion while carrying the Syamantaka was killed by
<div n="lb"/>Jāmbavān and the latter carried the gem to his den
<div n="lb"/>and gave it to his children to play with.
<div n="NI"/>When Prasena did not return from his hunting and
<div n="lb"/>was found later lying dead without the gem the news
<div n="lb"/>spread that the stone might have been stolen by
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa after killing Prasena. The slander reached the
<div n="lb"/>ears of Kṛṣṇa also and he went to the forest in search
<div n="lb"/>of the Syamantaka. He found the cave of Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>and on peeping in found the children of Jāmbavān
<div n="lb"/>playing with the gem. Jāmbavān attacked Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>after a grim battle which lasted for several days
<div n="lb"/>Jāmbavān was defeated. When he knew that it was
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa who had defeated him he gave him along with
<div n="lb"/>the Syamantaka his daughter Jāmbavatī also Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>brought the gem and the girl to Dvārakā and gave
<div n="lb"/>back the gem to Satrājit. (Chapter 38, Harivaṃśa;
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 13, Part 8, Padma Purāṇa).
