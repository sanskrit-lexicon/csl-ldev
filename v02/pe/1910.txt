DHANEŚVARA¦. A Brahmin born in the city of Avanti.
<div n="lb"/>Abandoning the duties enjoined by scriptures to a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin he strayed away from the Brahmin fold doing
<div n="lb"/>all sorts of sins. He became a store-house of sins. He
<div n="lb"/>was engaged in commerce and once while travelling he
<div n="lb"/>reached the city of Māhiṣmatī. There he met many people
<div n="lb"/>from several adjoining villages who had come there to ob-
<div n="lb"/>serve the Kārttika Vrata. Later Dhaneśvara was bitten by
<div n="lb"/>a cobra there and fell down fainting. Very soon he died.
<div n="NI"/>When he died the messengers of Yama came
<div n="lb"/>and took him bound to Kālapurī. There, Citra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta read out to Yama all the sins Dhaneśvara had
<div n="lb"/>committed from boyhood till his death. Citragupta
<div n="lb"/>added “Even from boyhood there is no record of any
<div n="lb"/>good deed done by him. On the other hand the sins he
<div n="lb"/>has committed could not be told in a year. He is an
<div n="lb"/>incarnation of evil. He must be roasted in hell till the
<div n="lb"/>end of the world.” On hearing this the body of Yama
<div n="lb"/>blazed like flame with anger and calling aside an atten-
<div n="lb"/>dant he ordered, “Hi, Pretapālaka, take this sinner
<div n="lb"/>away, beat him with spiked clubs and throw him into
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhīpāka”. Pretapālaka instantly took him away
<div n="lb"/>and breaking his head with a thorn-spiked club threw
[Page221-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>him into a copper vessel containing burning oil. But to
<div n="lb"/>his great amazement the burning oil became cold as
<div n="lb"/>soon as the body of Dhaneśvara came into contact with
<div n="lb"/>it just as it happened once before in the case of Prahlāda.
<div n="lb"/>The perplexed attendant ran to Yama and told him of
<div n="lb"/>this strange incident. Yama was also surprised at this
<div n="lb"/>novelty in hell and called back Dhaneśvara and started
<div n="lb"/>enquiring about his life once again. Nārada came there
<div n="lb"/>at that time. Both of them then talked about Dhaneśvara.
<div n="lb"/>Nārada told Yama how the unanticipated thing so
<div n="lb"/>happened because Dhaneśvara on the eve of his death
<div n="lb"/>spent some time with people who were observing the
<div n="lb"/>Kārttika Vrata washing away thus all the sins accumu-
<div n="lb"/>lated so far in his life. Hearing that Yama took Dhaneś-
<div n="lb"/>vara round hell and giving Dhaneśvara, the position of
<div n="lb"/>a Yakṣa sent him to Kuberapurī. (Chapter 115, Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
