MENAKĀ¦. A nymph of extraordinary beauty. Taking
<div n="lb"/>instructions from Indra, Menakā used to entice many
<div n="lb"/>sages and destroy their power of penance. There are
<div n="lb"/>innumerable stories of this kind in Purāṇas. Some
<div n="lb"/>important events connected with Menakā are given
<div n="lb"/>below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Mother of Pramadvarā.%} Once Menakā became preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant by a Gandharva named Viśvāvasu. On the day she
<div n="lb"/>delivered she threw the child on the banks of a river
<div n="lb"/>and went to Svarga. A sage named Sthūlakeśa who was
<div n="lb"/>doing penance nearby took the babe and brought it up.
<div n="lb"/>When she grew up she was named Pramadvarā and
<div n="lb"/>Ruru married her. (See under Pramadvarā).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Śakuntalā.%} When Viśvāmitra was perform-
<div n="lb"/>ing penance in the forests, Menakā, under instructions
<div n="lb"/>from Indra, went and enticed Viśvāmitra and broke the
<div n="lb"/>continuity of his penance. A girl was born to Menakā
<div n="lb"/>and became later the celebrated Śakuntalā. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Śakuntalā).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Again with Viśvāmitra.%} Once again when Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>was performing penance in Puṣkaratīrtha, Menakā appro-
<div n="lb"/>ached him and again Viśvāmitra fell in love with her and
<div n="lb"/>they lived together for ten years. Then one day Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra realised his folly and leaving her went again to
<div n="lb"/>the forests for penance.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Maṅkaṇa was enticed%} See under Maṅkaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) When once Durvāsas visited Devaloka it was
<div n="lb"/>Menakā who presented him with a flower garland. This
<div n="lb"/>incident led to the churning of the milk ocean at a
<div n="lb"/>later period. (See under Amṛta).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Menakā was one among the six prominent celestial
<div n="lb"/>maidens. Urvaśī, Pūrvacitti, Sahajanyā, Menakā,
<div n="lb"/>Ghṛtācī and Viśvācī are the six. (Śloka 68, Chapter 74,
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Menakā attended the Janmotsava of Arjuna and
<div n="lb"/>sang on the occasion. (Śloka 64, Chapter 122, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Menakā was a dancer in the court of Kubera
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 10, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Menakā once gave a music performance in the
<div n="lb"/>court of Indra in honour of Arjuna. (Śloka 29,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 43, Vana Parva).
