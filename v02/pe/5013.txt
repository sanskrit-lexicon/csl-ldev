PARABRAHMAN¦. The Supreme Spirit.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Brahman is the root cause of
<div n="lb"/>this universe. From Brahman originated Ākāśa (sky).
<div n="lb"/>From sky came air, from air came Agni and from
<div n="lb"/>Agni came water and from water was born this earth.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 377, Agni Purāṇa).
[Page567-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%General characteristics.%} Brahman is such that he who
<div n="lb"/>says he knows it does not know it and he who says he
<div n="lb"/>does not know it, knows it. It is beyond the experiences
<div n="lb"/>of time and space. The chief attributes of Brahman
<div n="lb"/>are Sat, Cit and Ānanda. Sat means existence, the
<div n="lb"/>really existent truth. The one and undivided existence.
<div n="lb"/>There are pandits who say that it was undivided,
<div n="lb"/>Nāstitva (nonexistence) that was at the beginning
<div n="lb"/>of the Universe. Since nothing can be born from
<div n="lb"/>‘nothing’ the world should have started from astitva
<div n="lb"/>(existence). There is a saying in Ṛgveda explaining
<div n="lb"/>the position thus:—“There was neither Astitva nor
<div n="lb"/>Nāstitva (existence or non-existence) at the beginning.”
<div n="lb"/>It is a matter to ponder how strongly conscious was
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛṣi who made the above statement about the
<div n="lb"/>Parabrahman's Nirguṇatva (devoid of attributes) and
<div n="lb"/>how clearly he tries to make it understandable to
<div n="lb"/>those who have not experienced the idea.
<div n="NI"/>Cit means knowledge, splendour, consciousness. Ānanda
<div n="lb"/>means bliss. Paul Deussen writes that the ancient
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads do not include in the definition of Brahman
<div n="lb"/>the term ‘ānanda’.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The two forms of Brahman.%} Brahman has two forms—
<div n="lb"/>Parabrahman and Aparabrahman. Parabrahman is
<div n="lb"/>Amūrta (formless, incorporeal) and Aparabrahman is
<div n="lb"/>Mūrta (embodied, corporeal). The Amūrta Brahman
<div n="lb"/>is known by such names as Parabrahman, Paramātmā
<div n="lb"/>and Nirguṇabrahman. The corporeal or material
<div n="lb"/>Brahman is Aparabrahman and thus this whole world
<div n="lb"/>is Aparabrahman.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Upaniṣads about Brahman.%}
<Poem>Aśabdamasparśamarūpamavyayaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Tathāsrasaṃ nityamagandhavacca yat /
<div n="lb"/>Anādyanantaṃ mahataḥ paraṃ dhruvaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Vicārya tanmṛtyumukhāt pramucyate //
<div n="lb"/>(Kaṭhopaniṣad)</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(With no sound, touch, form, taste or smell, with
<div n="lb"/>neither beginning nor end Brahman is imperishable).
<div n="lb"/>Na tatra cakṣurgacchati na vāk gacchati no mano
<div n="lb"/>Na vidmo na vijānīmo yathaitadanuśiṣyate /
<div n="lb"/>Anyadeva tadviditādatho aviditādadhi
<div n="lb"/>Iti śuśruma pūrveṣāṃ ye nastadvyācacakṣire.
<div n="lb"/>(Muṇḍakopaniṣad)
<div n="lb"/>(No eye goes there, no word goes there, no mind, no
<div n="lb"/>intelligence—we do not see it, we cannot describe it—
<div n="lb"/>you cannot imagine it nor can you understand it—It
<div n="lb"/>is distinct from the known and above the unknown.
<div n="lb"/>We have heard it spoken thus).
<Poem>Yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātam avijānatām. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Kenopaniṣad)
<div n="lb"/>(He understands It who comprehends It not; and he
<div n="lb"/>understands It not who feels he has understood. It is
<div n="lb"/>the unknown to those who have acquired real know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge while it is the known to those who are ignorant
<div n="lb"/>of true knowledge).
<Poem>Yat cakṣuṣā na paśyati
<div n="lb"/>Yena cakṣūṃṣi paśyati /
<div n="lb"/>Tadeva Brahma tvaṃ viddhi
<div n="lb"/>Nedaṃ yadidamupāsate. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Kenopaniṣad).
<div n="lb"/>(That which is not seen by the eye but that by which
<div n="lb"/>the eyes are able to see—That alone is Brahman and
<div n="lb"/>not that which people do worship here, do know that).

<div n="lb"/>Aprāpya manasā saha. (Taittirīya Upaniṣad).
<div n="lb"/>Avijñātaṃ Vijānatāṃ vijñātam avijānatām.
<div n="lb"/>(Kenopaniṣad)
<div n="lb"/>(It is unknown to people who think they know but
<div n="lb"/>known to those who did not profess to know it).
<div n="lb"/>Naiva vācā na manasā prāptuṃ śakyo na cakṣuṣā /
<div n="lb"/>Astīti bruvatosnyatra kathaṃ tadupalakṣyate. //
<div n="lb"/>(Kaṭhopaniṣad)
<div n="lb"/>(It is not possible to reach it by speech, mind or the
<div n="lb"/>eyes. How is it to be identified; or described?)—
<div n="lb"/>Digdeśaguṇādiphalabhedaśūnyaṃ hi paramārtha—
<div n="lb"/>Sat tad advayaṃ Brahma mandabuddhīnām asadiva
<div n="lb"/>pratibhāti.
<div n="lb"/>(Śaṅkarācārya).
<div n="lb"/>The sublime Truth (Brahman) is beyond time, place
<div n="lb"/>and attributes. Brahman is one (not two) and it is
<div n="lb"/>Sat (existent) but for the dull-witted, ignorant people
<div n="lb"/>it is Asat (non-existent).
<div n="lb"/>Satyamevopāsate, tadetat tryakṣaraṃ satyamiti;
<div n="lb"/>Sa ityekamakṣaram, tya ityeka.
<div n="lb"/>makṣaram, prathamottame akṣare satyam madhyato
<div n="lb"/>Anṛtaṃ tadetatamṛtamubhayataḥ satyena pari-
<div n="lb"/>gṛhītaṃ satyabhūyameva bhavati.
<div n="lb"/>(Bṛhadāraṇyaka).
<div n="lb"/>Kohamasmīti satyamiti brūyāt kiṃ tad yat
<div n="lb"/>Satyamiti yadanyad devebhyaśca prāṇebhyaśca /
