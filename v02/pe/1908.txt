DHANAÑJAYA V¦. There was once a brahmin ascetic
<div n="lb"/>called Dhanañjaya in the gotra of Vasiṣṭha. This hermit
<div n="lb"/>had hundred wives and got hundred sons, one by each
<div n="lb"/>of his wives. The son born of his wife Śābhāka (Śalāka)
<div n="lb"/>was named Karuṇa. The father divided his assets
<div n="lb"/>equally among his sons and yet they quarrelled with
<div n="lb"/>each other.
<div n="NI"/>Once Karuṇamuni went to the shores of Bhava-
<div n="lb"/>nāśinī along with a few other munis to worship
<div n="lb"/>Narasiṃha. There a brahmin had brought a lovely
<div n="lb"/>lime as an offering to the deity. Karuṇa took the lime
<div n="lb"/>from him and smelt it. At this the brahmin got angry
<div n="lb"/>and cursed him. “Sinner, may you live as a fly for a
<div n="lb"/>hundred years. Then Mahātmā Dadhīca will give you
<div n="lb"/>back your original form.” Karuṇa instantly became a
[Page221-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>fly and he pleaded to his wife thus “Beloved, I have
<div n="lb"/>become a fly. Please do protect me.” Karuṇa started
<div n="lb"/>flying hither and thither and his cruel brothers made
<div n="lb"/>the fly fall in oil and killed it. Śucismitā, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Karuṇa, started weeping laying the dead fly in her lap.
<div n="lb"/>Arundhatīdevī passing that way saw her and consoled
<div n="lb"/>her thus: ‘Śucismitā, stop lamenting. I shall bring it
<div n="lb"/>to life this instant by sacred ashes.’ So saying the Devī
<div n="lb"/>took some ashes from the fire-pit and reciting the
<div n="lb"/>powerful Mṛtyuñjaya mantra sprinkled it on the dead
<div n="lb"/>body of the fly. Śucismitā fanned the fly. The potency
<div n="lb"/>of the ashes brought the fly back to life.
<div n="NI"/>After a hundred years one of his relatives killed it
<div n="lb"/>again. Śucismitā grief-stricken, took the dead fly to the
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi, Dadhīca. The sage told her thus: “It was
<div n="lb"/>bhasma (sacred ashes) that gave life three times to
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni, Kaśyapa, the devas and myself. I will,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, give life to thy husband by bhasma itself.”
<div n="lb"/>Dadhīca took some ashes and meditating on Maheśvara
<div n="lb"/>recited a mantra and sprinkled it on the dead fly and
<div n="lb"/>brought it back to life. By the touch of Dadhīca, the
<div n="lb"/>fly, husband of Śucismitā, became Karuṇa again and
<div n="lb"/>both of them went back to their hermitage. (Chapter
<div n="lb"/>101, Padma Purāṇa).
