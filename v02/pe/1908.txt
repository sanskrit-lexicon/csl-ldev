DHANAÑJAYA V¦. There was once a brahmin ascetic
called Dhanañjaya in the gotra of Vasiṣṭha. This hermit
had hundred wives and got hundred sons, one by each
of his wives. The son born of his wife Śābhāka (Śalāka)
was named Karuṇa. The father divided his assets
equally among his sons and yet they quarrelled with
each other.
<div n="NI"/>Once Karuṇamuni went to the shores of Bhava-
nāśinī along with a few other munis to worship
Narasiṃha. There a brahmin had brought a lovely
lime as an offering to the deity. Karuṇa took the lime
from him and smelt it. At this the brahmin got angry
and cursed him. “Sinner, may you live as a fly for a
hundred years. Then Mahātmā Dadhīca will give you
back your original form.” Karuṇa instantly became a
[Page221-a+ 65]
fly and he pleaded to his wife thus “Beloved, I have
become a fly. Please do protect me.” Karuṇa started
flying hither and thither and his cruel brothers made
the fly fall in oil and killed it. Śucismitā, wife of
Karuṇa, started weeping laying the dead fly in her lap.
Arundhatīdevī passing that way saw her and consoled
her thus: ‘Śucismitā, stop lamenting. I shall bring it
to life this instant by sacred ashes.’ So saying the Devī
took some ashes from the fire-pit and reciting the
powerful Mṛtyuñjaya mantra sprinkled it on the dead
body of the fly. Śucismitā fanned the fly. The potency
of the ashes brought the fly back to life.
<div n="NI"/>After a hundred years one of his relatives killed it
again. Śucismitā grief-stricken, took the dead fly to the
Maharṣi, Dadhīca. The sage told her thus: “It was
bhasma (sacred ashes) that gave life three times to
Jamadagni, Kaśyapa, the devas and myself. I will,
therefore, give life to thy husband by bhasma itself.”
Dadhīca took some ashes and meditating on Maheśvara
recited a mantra and sprinkled it on the dead fly and
brought it back to life. By the touch of Dadhīca, the
fly, husband of Śucismitā, became Karuṇa again and
both of them went back to their hermitage. (Chapter
101, Padma Purāṇa).
