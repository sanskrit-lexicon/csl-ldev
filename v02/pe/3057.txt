<div n="lb"/>are the two mountains on the western side. On the
<div n="lb"/>south there are the two mountains of Kailāsa and
<div n="lb"/>Karavīra. The two mountains on the north are called
<div n="lb"/>Triśṛṅga and Makaragiri. It is stated in Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapters 109 and 141 that the abodes of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Kubera are on the mount Kailāsa. Once, to
<div n="lb"/>please Śiva, Mahāviṣṇu performed penance on Kailāsa.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 222, Stanzas 33 to 40). It
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned in Mahā Bhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>3 that the mountain Maināka stands to the north of
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa. Once Vyāsa went to Kailāsa. (M.B. Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 43, Stanza 17). In Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 106, mention is made that the King Sagara,
<div n="lb"/>with his two queens, once went to Kailāsa for penance.
<div n="lb"/>It was on the Kailāsa that Bhagīratha performed
<div n="lb"/>penance to propitiate Śiva to bring down Gaṅgā.
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa is hundred yojanas high. The devas come to
<div n="lb"/>this place daily and return. It is mentioned in Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 141, that in the place where Kubera
<div n="lb"/>lives on Kailāsa there live a large number of Yakṣas
<div n="lb"/>(demi-gods), Rākṣasas (giants) Kinnaras (heavenly
<div n="lb"/>musicians), Garuḍas (hawks) Mātaṅgas (elephants)
<div n="lb"/>and Gandharvas (semi-gods). The lake of lotus of
<div n="lb"/>Kubera which was reached by Bhīmasena once, was in
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa. In Vana Parva, it is mentioned that the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas visited Kailāsa during their forest life. It
<div n="lb"/>could be understood from Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 83 that Kāmadhenu performed penance
<div n="lb"/>on the Kailāsa, once.
