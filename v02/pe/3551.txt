KIRĀTĀRJUNĪYA¦. During the life in exile in the
forest of the Pāṇḍavas, Arjuna performed penance to
propitiate Śiva in the Himālayas. Disguised as a
forest-hunter Śiva appeared on the scene and tested
Arjuna's valour. Arjuna won in the test and was
presented the Pāśupatāstra by Śiva. The story is told
in Chapter 167 of the Vana Parva. (See under
