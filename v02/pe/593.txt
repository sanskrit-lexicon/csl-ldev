AŚVINĪSUTA¦. A son born to Sūrya of the wife of
Sutapas. There is this story about it in Brahmavai-
varta Purāṇa. Once when the wife of Sutapas was on
a pilgrimage Sūrya happened to see her. The beautiful
and venerable lady refused to accede to the desire of
Sūrya and so the latter used force and took her. They
had a son who was named Aśvinīsuta. On her return
after the pilgrimage with her son she explained all that
happened and the sage sent both of them out. Sūrya
taught his son Aśvinīsuta astrology and made him a
master in that science. Knowing that, Sutapas cursed
him and said he would turn to be one very diseased.
Later the sage amended his curse and added that he
would be free from disease if he worshipped the sun.
