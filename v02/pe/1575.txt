CITRĀṄGADA II¦. A son of the Mahārāja Śantanu.
<div n="lb"/>King Śantanu of the Candra dynasty had two wives,
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Satyavatī. Bhīṣma is the son born of Gaṅgā;
<div n="lb"/>of Satyavatī were born two sons, Citrāṅgada and Vici-
<div n="lb"/>travīrya. They were very brave and learned. After
<div n="lb"/>ruling his kingdom for a long period, living with Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vatī and the three children Śantanu passed away. Be-
<div n="lb"/>cause Bhīṣma dedicated himself to a life of unbroken
<div n="lb"/>chastity Citrāṅgada was crowned King. Once when he
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest for hunting he met with a gandharva
<div n="lb"/>of the same name. Both did not like the other to keep
<div n="lb"/>the same name and so a fight ensued. It was fought
<div n="lb"/>in Kurukṣetra and lasted for three years. In the end
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada was killed. Bhīṣma felt very sorry and after
<div n="lb"/>asking Vicitravīrya to perform the funeral rites crowned
<div n="lb"/>him as King. (Devī Bhāgavata, Prathama Skandha).
