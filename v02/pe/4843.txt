NIṢĀDA I¦. A forest dweller. The grand sire of the niṣāda
<div n="lb"/>tribe living in forests was one Niṣāda. Those forest-
<div n="lb"/>dwellers came to be known as niṣādas as they were the
<div n="lb"/>descendants of this Niṣāda. The Purāṇic story about
<div n="lb"/>the origin of Niṣāda is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time there lived a King called Vena. A
<div n="lb"/>very immoral ruler, he was hated by the people. As
<div n="lb"/>dharma declined in the country due to the misrule of
<div n="lb"/>Vena the maharṣis killed him with darbha grass sancti-
<div n="lb"/>fied by mantras. Then the maharṣis saw dust rising
<div n="lb"/>up everywhere and people told them that the poor
<div n="lb"/>people, in the absence of king, had turned into thieves
<div n="lb"/>and the dust was formed by the onrush of the thieves.
<div n="lb"/>To remedy the problem thus created the maharṣis
<div n="lb"/>churned the thigh of Vena, who had died childless, for
<div n="lb"/>a son, and from the thigh was born a male child, dark in
<div n="lb"/>colour, dwarfish and with a compressed face. Sadly he
<div n="lb"/>asked the brahmins (maharṣis) what he should do. They
<div n="lb"/>asked him to sit (niṣīda) and hence he became Niṣāda
<div n="lb"/>(forest-dweller). His descendants settled down on mount
<div n="lb"/>Vindhya and they by their sinful lives divested Vena
<div n="lb"/>of his sins. Vena was absolved of his sins through the
<div n="lb"/>Niṣādas, and thus the Niṣādas became responsible for
<div n="lb"/>the ending of Vena's sins. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 13).
