NIṢĀDA I¦. A forest dweller. The grand sire of the niṣāda
tribe living in forests was one Niṣāda. Those forest-
dwellers came to be known as niṣādas as they were the
descendants of this Niṣāda. The Purāṇic story about
the origin of Niṣāda is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time there lived a King called Vena. A
very immoral ruler, he was hated by the people. As
dharma declined in the country due to the misrule of
Vena the maharṣis killed him with darbha grass sancti-
fied by mantras. Then the maharṣis saw dust rising
up everywhere and people told them that the poor
people, in the absence of king, had turned into thieves
and the dust was formed by the onrush of the thieves.
To remedy the problem thus created the maharṣis
churned the thigh of Vena, who had died childless, for
a son, and from the thigh was born a male child, dark in
colour, dwarfish and with a compressed face. Sadly he
asked the brahmins (maharṣis) what he should do. They
asked him to sit (niṣīda) and hence he became Niṣāda
(forest-dweller). His descendants settled down on mount
Vindhya and they by their sinful lives divested Vena
of his sins. Vena was absolved of his sins through the
Niṣādas, and thus the Niṣādas became responsible for
the ending of Vena's sins. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1,
Chapter 13).
