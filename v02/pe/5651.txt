RAMAṆA¦ (M). (RAMAṆAKAM). An island near
Dvārakā where, according to Chapter 38 of the Southern
Text of Bhārata, there was a forest. It was in this island
that Vinatā, mother of Garuḍa and Kadrū, mother of
the nāgas lived. Garuḍa, after freeing his mother from
her slavery evicted the nāgas from this island. (Brah-
māṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 17). Following the eviction,
many of the prominent nāgas lived in Pātāla. But,
Kāliya, in fear of Garuḍa, lived in Kālindī. After his
suppression by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Kāliya, with his family, as
advised by Kṛṣṇa returned to Ramaṇakam. (Bhāgavata,
10th Skandha).
