BṚHADRATHA IV¦. Son of Uparicara, the king of
<div n="lb"/>Cedi. Uparicara made his son Bṛhadratha, king of
<div n="lb"/>Magadha. In course of time he became a powerful
<div n="lb"/>emperor. This Bṛhadratha was a mighty warrior-king
<div n="lb"/>with an army of three akṣauhiṇīs (an akṣauhiṇi is a
<div n="lb"/>complete army consisting of 21870 horses and 109350
<div n="lb"/>infantry). Though he had married two daughters of
<div n="lb"/>the King of Kāśi he was childless. The sorrowful king
<div n="lb"/>went with his wives to a hermit named Caṇḍakauśika
<div n="lb"/>and pleased him by giving him precious stones. The
<div n="lb"/>King told the hermit about his sorrow due to lack of
<div n="lb"/>children. The hermit gave them a mango fruit and
<div n="lb"/>said that the King should enthrone the son who would
<div n="lb"/>be born by eating the mango, and return to the forest
<div n="lb"/>for penance. The hermit gave eight boons for the son
<div n="lb"/>who was to be born.
<div n="NI"/>The King and his wives returned to the palace and
<div n="lb"/>divided the mango fruit into two and both of his wives
<div n="lb"/>ate the fruit and became pregnant. Each of them gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to half of a child. The lifeless forms of these half
<div n="lb"/>children were thrown out. A giantess called Jarā put
<div n="lb"/>them together and instantly the pieces joined together
<div n="lb"/>and became a living child. The giantess took that child
<div n="lb"/>and made a present of it to the King. That child grew up
<div n="lb"/>and was known by the famous name Jarāsandha. From
<div n="lb"/>that time onwards Giantess-worship began in Magadha.
<div n="lb"/>When Jarāsandha came of age the King anointed him
<div n="lb"/>as King and went to the hermitage of Caṇḍakauśika
<div n="lb"/>with his wives and began to do penance. After coming
<div n="lb"/>to the forest Bṛhadratha killed a giant named Ṛṣabha
<div n="lb"/>and with his hide made three Big drums and placed
<div n="lb"/>them in the city. The sound of one beat on the drum
<div n="lb"/>will last for a month. When Bhīma, Arjuna and Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa came to Magadha to kill Jarāsandha they broke
<div n="lb"/>these drums. (M.B. Ādi Parva, 53; Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 17, 19 and 21).
