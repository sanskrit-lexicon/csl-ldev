AGHA¦. The name of an asura. This asura was one of
<div n="lb"/>the followers of Kaṃsa. According to the instructions
<div n="lb"/>of Kaṃsa, Agha once set out to Gokula to kill Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. At that time Śrī Kṛṣṇa was playing on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the river Kālindī with other cowherds. Aghā-
<div n="lb"/>sura watched the games of the children from the sky
<div n="lb"/>above. Then he transformed himself into a colossal
<div n="lb"/>serpent and lay with his mouth wide open; his open
<div n="lb"/>mouth looked like an immense cave. The foul smell
<div n="lb"/>coming from his mouth soon spread over the whole
<div n="lb"/>place. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the other children did not know
<div n="lb"/>anything about this. In the course of their games they
<div n="lb"/>walked into the cave-like mouth of Agha and were soon
<div n="lb"/>trapped in his belly. Agha then closed his mouth and
<div n="lb"/>all the boys including Śrī Kṛṣṇa were now imprisoned
<div n="lb"/>inside his body. Some of the boys died. Realizing the
<div n="lb"/>situation Śrī Kṛṣṇa now enlarged his body. His body
<div n="lb"/>grew larger and larger until at last it burst open the body
<div n="lb"/>of the serpent (Agha). Thus Agha was killed. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>then restored the dead boys to life by his divine looks
<div n="lb"/>(Kaṭākṣa). This Aghāsura was the brother of Bakāsura
<div n="lb"/>and Pūtanā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, Chapter 12).
