JANASTHĀNA¦. This is a part of the forest Daṇḍaka, which
lies in the basin of the Godāvarī. Śrī Rāma had lived
in this forest with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa for a long time
during the period of his forest-life. It was at this place
that Śrī Rāma killed fourteen thousand Rākṣasas
[Page347-b+ 65]
(giants) such as Khara Dūṣaṇa, Triśiras and others.
(M.B. Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38).
Mārīca allured Sītā and Rāvaṇa kidnapped her in this
place. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 147). Śūrpaṇakhā
tried to attract Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and her nose
etc, were cut off, in this forest. It was in this place
that Śrī Rāma cut off the head of a Rākṣasa (demon)
and threw it away. That head fell in the lap of a hermit
called Mahodara. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 39).
Janasthāna is regarded as a holy place. It is mentioned
in Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 25, Stanza
29, that those who stay in this place and take bath in
the Godāvarī will acquire imperial prosperity.
