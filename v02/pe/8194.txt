VENA I¦. An ancient King who was notorious for his
bad rule.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
order: Brahmā-Svāyambhuva Manu-Uttānapāda-
Dhruva-Śiṣṭi-Ripu-Cākṣuṣa Manu-Kuru-Aṅga-Vena.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Ten sons including Kuru, were born to
Manu Cākṣuṣa by his wife Naḍvalā. Āgneyī, the wife
of Kuru gave birth to six sons Aṅga and others. Aṅga
married Sunīthā. The son Vena was born by Sunīthā.
It is mentioned in Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter
13, that Sunīthā, the mother of Vena was the eldest
daughter of Yama, and in Vāmana Purāṇa Chap-
ter 47, that this Sunīthā was the daughter born to Kāla
[Page844-b+ 64]
and Mṛtyu. Vena who was born as the son of the
daughter of Yama was born a wicked man because of
the badness of his grandfather.
<div n="NI"/>Vena grew up as a great sinner. A story occurs in
Padma Purāṇa about an incident which caused Vena
to become a great sinner.
<div n="NI"/>The story says that Sunīthā was the mother of Vena. In
her play she used to imitate her father's job which was
hurting others. One day when she went to the forest
for play with her maids she saw Suśaṅkha the son of
a Gandharva named Gītakolāhala. That youth who
was handsome in every part of his body, was doing
penance meditating on the goddess Sarasvatī for the
attainment of the art of music. Sunīthā began to annoy
him daily. Suśaṅkha bore this annoyance patiently.
He said only this-“Go away, go away.” But she did
not pay heed to his appeals. Once she became angry
and struck him. Getting angry at this, Suśaṅkha called
out, “You wicked girl! Why do you annoy me? You
have beaten me, who am engaged in penance, for no
cause.” That righteous Gandharva youth curbed his
anger considering that she was a woman.
<div n="NI"/>She told him “My father will beat everybody in the
three worlds. He will harm the wicked, and will not
do any harm to the good. So he rules the country
righteously.” Sunīthā told all about the story to her
father. Though Yama, the incarnation of righteousness,
heard all that his daughter said he did not give any
reply.
<div n="NI"/>She again went to the forest and struck him with a
whip. Suśaṅka rose up, shivering with pain and cursed
her thus:
<div n="NI"/>“You wicked girl! When you become a house-holder
and join your husband you will get a son who will be a
scoffer of Devas and Brahmins and an all-round sinner.”
Thus cursing her he continued his penance. Vena was
born according to this curse.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The wicked rule of Vena.%} The hermits anointed Vena
as the King. He became lord of the whole earth. He
made a proclamation thus:—“Sacrifice is prohibited.
Giving alms, is prohibited. Offerings of no kind should
be made. Who else, other than I, can be the Yajña-
puruṣa? (the deity who eats the food of sacrifice)? I
am the only lord and consumer of sacrifices.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this proclamation, the hermits approached
him and told him that the Vedas were the basis of
righteousness, that sacrifices were ordained in them, and
that if no sacrifice was performed the Devas would not
be pleased and so on. But this did not make any change
in his behaviour.
<div n="NI"/>The hermits became angry. They all gathered together
and recited spells and struck him with Darbha (poa)
grass and killed him. As there was no King the world
fell into darkness. Because of the troubles caused by
plunderers, people gathered round the hermits. Hermits
joined together and churned the left hand of Vena,
from which a man of short stature came out, to whom
the hermits said, ‘Niṣīda’ (sit). Because the hermits
said Niṣīda’, Niṣāda came into existence from that
dwarf born of the sins of Vena. Then the hermits
churned the right hand of Vena. At this churning a
person as big as a mountain with divine signs came out.
He had bow and arrows and in his palm there were
marks of a wheel and flag. Seeing this the Devas
[Page845-a+ 65]
anointed him the King of the earth. He ruled righte-
ously and brought the goddess earth (Pṛthvī) who had
estranged herself from his father Vena close to him.
Because he had conciliated Pṛthvī he became famous
as a King. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 47).
