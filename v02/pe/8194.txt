VENA I¦. An ancient King who was notorious for his
<div n="lb"/>bad rule.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order: Brahmā-Svāyambhuva Manu-Uttānapāda-
<div n="lb"/>Dhruva-Śiṣṭi-Ripu-Cākṣuṣa Manu-Kuru-Aṅga-Vena.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Ten sons including Kuru, were born to
<div n="lb"/>Manu Cākṣuṣa by his wife Naḍvalā. Āgneyī, the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Kuru gave birth to six sons Aṅga and others. Aṅga
<div n="lb"/>married Sunīthā. The son Vena was born by Sunīthā.
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>13, that Sunīthā, the mother of Vena was the eldest
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Yama, and in Vāmana Purāṇa Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 47, that this Sunīthā was the daughter born to Kāla
[Page844-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and Mṛtyu. Vena who was born as the son of the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Yama was born a wicked man because of
<div n="lb"/>the badness of his grandfather.
<div n="NI"/>Vena grew up as a great sinner. A story occurs in
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa about an incident which caused Vena
<div n="lb"/>to become a great sinner.
<div n="NI"/>The story says that Sunīthā was the mother of Vena. In
<div n="lb"/>her play she used to imitate her father's job which was
<div n="lb"/>hurting others. One day when she went to the forest
<div n="lb"/>for play with her maids she saw Suśaṅkha the son of
<div n="lb"/>a Gandharva named Gītakolāhala. That youth who
<div n="lb"/>was handsome in every part of his body, was doing
<div n="lb"/>penance meditating on the goddess Sarasvatī for the
<div n="lb"/>attainment of the art of music. Sunīthā began to annoy
<div n="lb"/>him daily. Suśaṅkha bore this annoyance patiently.
<div n="lb"/>He said only this-“Go away, go away.” But she did
<div n="lb"/>not pay heed to his appeals. Once she became angry
<div n="lb"/>and struck him. Getting angry at this, Suśaṅkha called
<div n="lb"/>out, “You wicked girl! Why do you annoy me? You
<div n="lb"/>have beaten me, who am engaged in penance, for no
<div n="lb"/>cause.” That righteous Gandharva youth curbed his
<div n="lb"/>anger considering that she was a woman.
<div n="NI"/>She told him “My father will beat everybody in the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds. He will harm the wicked, and will not
<div n="lb"/>do any harm to the good. So he rules the country
<div n="lb"/>righteously.” Sunīthā told all about the story to her
<div n="lb"/>father. Though Yama, the incarnation of righteousness,
<div n="lb"/>heard all that his daughter said he did not give any
<div n="lb"/>reply.
<div n="NI"/>She again went to the forest and struck him with a
<div n="lb"/>whip. Suśaṅka rose up, shivering with pain and cursed
<div n="lb"/>her thus:
<div n="NI"/>“You wicked girl! When you become a house-holder
<div n="lb"/>and join your husband you will get a son who will be a
<div n="lb"/>scoffer of Devas and Brahmins and an all-round sinner.”
<div n="lb"/>Thus cursing her he continued his penance. Vena was
<div n="lb"/>born according to this curse.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The wicked rule of Vena.%} The hermits anointed Vena
<div n="lb"/>as the King. He became lord of the whole earth. He
<div n="lb"/>made a proclamation thus:—“Sacrifice is prohibited.
<div n="lb"/>Giving alms, is prohibited. Offerings of no kind should
<div n="lb"/>be made. Who else, other than I, can be the Yajña-
<div n="lb"/>puruṣa? (the deity who eats the food of sacrifice)? I
<div n="lb"/>am the only lord and consumer of sacrifices.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this proclamation, the hermits approached
<div n="lb"/>him and told him that the Vedas were the basis of
<div n="lb"/>righteousness, that sacrifices were ordained in them, and
<div n="lb"/>that if no sacrifice was performed the Devas would not
<div n="lb"/>be pleased and so on. But this did not make any change
<div n="lb"/>in his behaviour.
<div n="NI"/>The hermits became angry. They all gathered together
<div n="lb"/>and recited spells and struck him with Darbha (poa)
<div n="lb"/>grass and killed him. As there was no King the world
<div n="lb"/>fell into darkness. Because of the troubles caused by
<div n="lb"/>plunderers, people gathered round the hermits. Hermits
<div n="lb"/>joined together and churned the left hand of Vena,
<div n="lb"/>from which a man of short stature came out, to whom
<div n="lb"/>the hermits said, ‘Niṣīda’ (sit). Because the hermits
<div n="lb"/>said Niṣīda’, Niṣāda came into existence from that
<div n="lb"/>dwarf born of the sins of Vena. Then the hermits
<div n="lb"/>churned the right hand of Vena. At this churning a
<div n="lb"/>person as big as a mountain with divine signs came out.
<div n="lb"/>He had bow and arrows and in his palm there were
<div n="lb"/>marks of a wheel and flag. Seeing this the Devas
[Page845-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>anointed him the King of the earth. He ruled righte-
<div n="lb"/>ously and brought the goddess earth (Pṛthvī) who had
<div n="lb"/>estranged herself from his father Vena close to him.
<div n="lb"/>Because he had conciliated Pṛthvī he became famous
<div n="lb"/>as a King. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 47).
