<div n="NI"/>But Ketu maintained closer relationship with Rāhu, a
step-brother of his, being the son of Kaśyapa by ano-
ther wife called Siṃhikā. Rāhu and Ketu are even
today considered as inauspicious planets. Rāhu wears
a half-moon and Ketu holds in his hands a sword and
lamp. Amitaujas was Ketu reborn. (Ādi Parva, Chapter
67, Verse 11).
