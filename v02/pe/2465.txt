GOMANTA I¦. A famous mountain near Dvārakā. This
mountain is known as Goma and Raivataka also. Once
Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to see Gomanta and on the way met
Paraśurāma. (Skandha 10, Bhāgavata). Paraśurāma
and Śrī Kṛṣṇa went together and saw this beautiful
mountain. Vyāsa has devoted Chapter 40 of Viṣṇu
Parva entirely for the description of this mountain of
Gomanta. Once Balabhadrarāma caught hold of Jarā-
sandha on this mountain but let him off.
