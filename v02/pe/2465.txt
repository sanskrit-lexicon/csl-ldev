GOMANTA I¦. A famous mountain near Dvārakā. This

<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to see Gomanta and on the way met
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma. (Skandha 10, Bhāgavata). Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>and Śrī Kṛṣṇa went together and saw this beautiful
<div n="lb"/>mountain. Vyāsa has devoted Chapter 40 of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Parva entirely for the description of this mountain of
<div n="lb"/>Gomanta. Once Balabhadrarāma caught hold of Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha on this mountain but let him off.
