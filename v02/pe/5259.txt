PRADYOTA II¦. The first king of the dynasty of Pra-
dyota. He was the son of a king called Śunaka.
Pradyota is referred to as Śunakaputra in Vāyu Purāṇa.
[Page594-a+ 63]
Kṣemaka alias Śunaka father of Pradyota was killed by
Mlecchas (a barbarous tribe). To avenge the death of
his father Pradyota under the advice of Nārada decided
to conduct a Mleccha Yajña and for that purpose dug a
Yajñakuṇḍa seventeen miles long and seventeen miles
wide. The Yajña started and in that Yajṅa different
kinds of Mlecchas were burnt to death. From then
onwards Pradyumna got the name ‘Mlecchahantā’
(killer of Mlecchas). (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
