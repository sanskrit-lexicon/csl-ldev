VIŚVĀMITRA¦. A royal hermit of immense attainments.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Brahmā in the following
order Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas
-Vijaya—Hotraka—Jahnu—Puru—Balāka—Ajaka—
Kuśa—Kuśanābha—Gādhi—Viśvāmitra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Six beautiful daughters were born to Kuśa-
nābha the son of King Kuśa. The hermit Brahmadatta
married them. After this a son named Gādhi was born
to Kuśanābha. Two children named Satyavatī and
Viśvāmitra were born to Gādhi. Satyavatī was married
to Ṛcīka; As he was born in the family of the famous
king Kuśa, Viśvāmitra got the name Kauśika also. His
kingdom was Kānyakubja. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla
Kāṇḍa, Sarga 34).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Becoming a hermit.%} Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha were
two hermits who were hostile to each other throughout
their lives. A quarrel with Vasiṣṭha, persuaded
Viśvāmitra to become a hermit.
<div n="NI"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 51).
[Page872-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>The hermit Vasiṣṭha erected his hermitage and did
penance in the country of Viśvāmitra. Once, while
engaged in hunting Viśvāmitra saw Nandinī in the
hermitage of Vasiṣṭha, and wanted to have her. In the
battle which ensued between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra,
the hermit Vasiṣṭha came out victorious. The ashamed
Viśvāmitra gave up his kingdom and went to forest
to do penance. Viśvāmitra became a royal hermit of
great attainments. There were constant confrontations
between the Rājarṣi and the Brahmarṣi (King-hermit
and Brahmin-hermit). (For the detailed story of the
quarrels between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha see under
Vasiṣṭha, para 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Viśvāmitra and Hariścandra.%} The histories of Viśvā-
mitra, Vasiṣṭha and Hariścandra are intertwined as a
triple string. Viśvāmitra made Hariścandra, the most
renowned of the men of veracity, go begging.
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra and Viśvāmitra. Their history begins from
King Triśaṅku of the Solar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>Formerly the name of Triśaṅku was Satyavrata. Aruṇa
was the father of Satyavrata. When Aruṇa was reigning
the prince Satyavrata was leading a wicked life. He
once entered the wedding hall of a Brahmin and carried
away the bride by force. When the king knew this, he
expelled the prince from the palace. Vasiṣṭha, as the
family priest, was behind the cruelty on the part of the
king towards his son. It was because of this that Viśvā-
mitra crossed the path of Satyavrata.
<div n="NI"/>Satyavrata went to the forest and lived like a low-caste
man. King Aruṇa repented his rashness. Entrusting his
kingdom to Vasiṣṭha, Aruṇa went to the forest to do pen-
ance. For twelve years there was no rain in the country.
Famine broke out. Viśvāmitra's wife and three children
were in great difficulty. The hermit had been engaged
in penance. So the wife of the hermit decided to sell
the middle son for the sake of maintaining the rest and
started for the market with her children. On
the way Satyavrata met them and learned the whole
story. He told her not to sell the child. He agreed to
give them food till the arrival of Viśvāmitra. The agree-
ment was that he would tie the meat, obtained by hunt-
ing, to a tree outside the hermitage, every day. Satya-
vrata carried out the promise. One day he did not get
anything from hunting. He caught hold of Vasiṣṭha's
cow which had been grazing in the forest and killed it
and gave its flesh to the family of Viśvāmitra. On com-
ing to know this Vasiṣṭha cursed him and changed his
form into that of a caṇḍāla (low-caste). Moreover, as
he had incurred three sins such as stealing of a bride,
anger of father and cow-slaughter, he came to be
called Triśaṅku from that day onwards. Weighed down
by these sins, he tried to commit suicide. Devī appeared
before him and gave him back his original form and
his kingdom.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of Aruṇa, Triśaṅku assumed the reign.
Hariścandra was his son. After giving the country to his
son, Triśaṅku requested Vasiṣṭha to perform the sacrifice
to send him to heaven bodily. Vasiṣṭha said that it was
impossible for him. Vasiṣṭha's enemy Viśvāmitra took
up the task. He lifted Triśaṅku bodily, up to heaven.
But he was denied admittance in heaven and so Viśvā-
mitra created an artificial heaven between the earth
and heaven and made Triśaṅku stay there.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra was keeping up hostile attitude towards the
[Page873-a+ 65]
kings of the Solar dynasty. In reality it was not the
hostility towards the Solar dynasty, but it was his
enmity against Vasiṣṭha. Viśvāmitra did not like
Vasiṣṭha's being the family-priest of the kings of the
Solar dynasty. So Viśvāmitra kept up an attitude of
antipathy towards them. This is the background of the
quarrel between Hariścandra and Viśvāmitra.
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra took Candramatī, the daughter of Śibi,
as his first wife. Besides her, he had ninetynine wives.
But they had no children. At last according to the
advice of Vasiṣṭha he went to the basin of the Ganges
and did penance before Varuṇa. Viśvāmitra did not
like this. Varuṇa appeared and said that Hariścandra
would get a son. The king had promised that he would
give his son as a sacrificial animal to Varuṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Candramatī became pregnant and delivered a son. He
was named Rohitāśva. Even after the lapse of a month,
the son was not given to Varuṇa. On several occasions
Varuṇa demanded the child; and Hariścandra would
give some excuses. Finally the king agreed to hand
him over to Varuṇa at the age of eleven after his
Upanayana (investiture with the Brahma string). The
boy completed his tenth year. Preparations were being
made in the palace, for Upanayana, when Varuṇa
arrived. The prince, who was aware of the fact that his
father would sacrifice him after his Upanayana, ran
away from the palace at night. Varuṇa asked the king
to hand over the boy to him. The king was in great
perplexity. Varuṇa cursed the king that he would catch
the disease called Jalodara (dropsy). Thus the king be-
came a sick man. Rohitāśva heard from travellers that
his father was ill. On many occasions he wanted to
return to the palace. But Indra appeared before him in
the form of a Brahmin and dissuaded him from
going to the palace.
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra called Vasiṣṭha and asked him to suggest
a remedy for this woe and misery. Vasiṣṭha advised
him to fulfil somehow or other, the promise made to
Varuṇa. The hermit continued. “Sons are of ten types.
A son bought for price also is included in this. So it
is enough if a son is bought for price and is sacrificed.
Some Brahmin may be found, who will be willing to sell
his son. If you please Varuṇa thus, you will be cured.”
<div n="NI"/>The King was delighted to hear this. He instruct-
ed his minister to find out any Brahmin who was will-
ing to sell his son. A greedy Brahmin was found out.
His name was Ajīgarta. He had three sons. He was
prepared to sell the second son, Śunaśśepha. The minister
agreed to give him hundred cows in return.
<div n="NI"/>Up to this time Viśvāmitra had been waging only a
shadow war against the Kings of the Solar dynasty.
From this moment he entered the scene of war. The
minister bought Śunaśśepha and brought him to the
palace. Viśvāmitra also arrived at the palace. He
sympathised with Śunaśśepha who was crying pitiably.
He asked the King to release the boy, and gave a
warning that if the boy was not set free, the sacrifice
would be obstructed. The King said that he was doing
so to get recovery from illness, that he would give Viśvā-
mitra a good deal of wealth, and requested him not to
cause any hindrance to the sacrifice. These words and
the misery of the boy kindled the anger of Viśvāmitra.
He called Śunaśśepha and taught him Varuṇamantra
(spell) and told him to repeat the mantra when he was
lying on the slaughter-stone and that he would escape
[Page873-b+ 65]
death. Śunaśśepha did as he was told. Varuṇa became
pleased with him and appearing before the King said,
“Leave Śunaśśepha and perform the sacrifice. You will
get recovery.” Saying so Varuṇa disappeared. Immedi-
ately the King was cured of his disease. At the order of
the King Śunaśśepha was set free. The sound ‘Jaya Jaya’
(victory) reverberated in the sacrificial hall. Śunaśśepha
got up and asked. “Oh great men. Who is my father
now? Some said that it was Ajīgarta. Some others
argued that it was Hariścandra. Some said that it was
Varuṇa.” At this time Vasiṣṭha stood up and said.
“Oh, great men, please stop arguing. I shall give reply
in accordance with the convention of Vedas. When he
bargained on the price of his son and received the cost
Ajīgarta lost his paternity. Thenceforward Hariścandra
who bought the boy became his father. From the
moment he had issued orders to bind the boy and place
him on the slaughter-stone, he also had lost his paternity.
The claim of Varuṇa to his paternity, because the boy
had been saved from death by him, does not hold good.
Any god will be pleased, when praised and glorified
with great laudatory mantras and will confer upon the
supplicant wealth, life, cow, land, salvation etc. There
is nothing unusual in this. But it was Viśvāmitra who
taught him the Varuṇa-spell in his pitiable and danger-
ous situation. So Viśvāmitra alone has claim to the
boy's paternity.”
<div n="NI"/>Those who were present, accepted this decision.
Immediately Viśvāmitra took Śunaśśepha with him and
went to his hermitage. Hearing about the recovery of
the King, Rohitāśva returned to the palace from the
forest. Hariścandra received him with tears of joy. The
King, with his wife and son led a happy life and ruled
over his subjects with justice and truth. At this time,
Hariścandra (of Kakutstha's family) accepting Vasiṣṭha
as the main priest performed the famous sacrifice of
Rājasūya (Royal) consecration with ceremonies and
festivities. With this the fame of Hariścandra spread
far and wide.
<div n="NI"/>At this point begins the next stage of confrontation
between Viśvāmitra and Hariścandra. Vasiṣṭha once
reached heaven. Viśvāmitra also reached there at the
same time. The devas greeted both honourably. But
Viśvāmitra saw that Vasiṣṭha was shown some parti-
ality. This was unpalatable to Viśvāmitra, who asked
Vasiṣṭha. “What excellence have you, more than I?”
Vasiṣṭha replied. ‘Have you not heard about Hariś-
candra, the King of the Solar dynasty? It is the noblest
dynasty in the world. The family priesthood of this
dynasty also is laudable. My disciple Hariścandra of
that royal family has recently performed the sacrifice of
Rājasūya. I was the Supreme priest of the function.
This is a covetable position not attainable to many.
Moreover, there is none in the world, more truthful,
firm of character, more charitable and more liberal than
Hariścandra. This is a fact.”
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra got up angrily and argued that Hariś-
candra was not truthful. He staked all the fruits of
his penance to prove this. From that day onwards Viśvā-
mitra began to make moves to instigate Hariścandra to
deviate from the path of truth.
<div n="NI"/>Once Hariścandra, while he was hunting, met a lonely
woman in the forest. She was moaning. The King
asked why she was lamenting. She replied. “Oh King.
I am Siddhirūpiṇī (a goddess who helps people to attain
[Page874-a+ 65]
anything). Viśvāmitra is doing penance to possess me. I
request you to protect me.” The King promised her to
see that she was not subjected to the molestation of
Viśvāmitra any longer. After that Hariścandra went to
the hermitage of Viśvāmitra and made an enquiry. He
then asked the hermit to stop penance, as his severe,
intense, penance was harmful to many people in the
country. The King returned to the palace. Viśvāmitra
got angry and stood up. Up to this time only a cold war
existed between them. Hostility became open now.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra began to make moves against Hariścandra
quickly. He changed a fierce asura into a hog and sent
it to the garden of Hariścandra. The hog destroyed the
garden. All the attempts made by the guards to drive
the hog away ended in failure. They informed the King.
The King mounted on a horse and with weapons
started for the garden. Without paying any heed to
the arrows of the King, the hog ran away. The King
began to chase it. The hog seemed to be near. Then it
was away, then in front of the King and suddenly it
appeared behind him. Then it would disappear
instantly. In this manner the hog played around the
King. After a while, the King was separated from his
army and was entrapped, all alone, in a thick forest. He
did not find any way out. He lost his way in the forest.
As he was thus walking slowly, he saw a stream of pure
water in front of him. Both the King and the horse drank
from the stream. As he was standing thus without know-
ing the way to return home, Viśvāmitra went to him in
the guise of an old Brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>The King honoured the old man, and told him that he
was Hariścandra, the King of Ayodhyā, and that by
chasing a hog which destroyed his garden, he had
reached the forest. He continued telling the old Brahmin
who had helped him. “You might have heard that
Hariścandra, the King of Ayodhyā, had performed the
sacrifice Rājasūya. I am that same King. It is my vow
to give anybody what he asks for. If you want money
or anything for sacrifice or for any other purpose, just
come to Ayodhyā. I will give you whatever you want.”
The old man was pleased. He told the King that the
jungle-stream flowed through a holy place and that
it would be better to offer the gift after taking a bath
in the river. The King purified himself by bathing in
the river and then said. “Sir, I am ready to offer gifts.
State your needs. It is my vow to give what is requested.
At the time of the Rājasūya I acted so towards all of
you and took a vow that I would do so in future also. I
am glad because I have met you on the bank of this
holy stream. So tell me quickly what you want.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmin:—“Oh King, I have heard about your fame.
Moreover there is nobody in the world equal to Hariś-
candra, born of the Solar dynasty, the son of Triśaṅku
in liberality. Such is the opinion of hermit Vasiṣṭha.
There is nothing more to know about you, oh, King,
who is such a man of liberality. I have only one desire.
The marriage of my son is being conducted. I do not
possess enough money for the marriage. I want only a
help for the same.” The King thought it to be a very
simple request, and promised to give the required
amount. Viśvāmitra by illusion customary to Gandharvas
created a young man and a young woman, and showed
them to the King saying that they were his son and
daughter. Then the Brahmin who was delighted by the
promise, showed the King the way to the palace.
[Page874-b+ 65]
After making all arrangements for the marriage, Viśvā-
mitra approached King Hariścandra. The King asked
him what amount he required. “Give me your kingdom
with all the elephants, horses, chariots, jewels and
wealth in it”, said Viśvāmitra. The King who had
been led to this deception by Viśvāmitra, having no go,
agreed. Thus Viśvāmitra obtained the kingdom and
everything that Hariścandra possessed. It is conven-
tional that whenever a gift is given to Brahmins, a
dakṣiṇā (monetary gift) also should be given along
with it. Otherwise the gift will be futile. The King
asked the Brahmin what he wanted as dakṣiṇā. He
demanded two and a half Bhāras of gold as dakṣiṇā.
The King agreed to give that also. But where to get
this amount from, since he had lost his kingdom and
everything? Having sunk deep in misery due to the
deceit of Viśvāmitra, the King sat on the soil, cursing
his fate. Seeing this, the queen ran to him and cried.
While he was telling his wife every thing, Viśvāmitra
came there and said:
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra:—“Hariscandra! According to the gift
hand over your country and everything instantly. I
must have the dakṣiṇā of two and a half Bhāras of gold
also just now.”
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra:—“Sir! According to my promise receive
everything now. We are leaving the country instantly.
But since I have given you everything that I had, how
can I give you dakṣiṇā? Everything I had, has become
yours. The amount for dakṣiṇā has yet to be procured.
So receive the gift now. The dakṣiṇā shall be given as
early as possible.”
<div n="NI"/>After giving everything to the hermit, the King left the
country with only the cloth he had been wearing. His
wife and child followed him. The hermit also follow-
ed the King compelling him to give him the dakṣiṇā.
The King told him that only after paying this debt
would he eat any food, and that he would pay the
amount within a month. Viśvāmitra, unwillingly agreed
to this.
<div n="NI"/>With his wife Candramatī and his young son, Hariś-
candra reached Kāśī. After a month Viśvāmitra came
to Kāśī for the amount of dakṣiṇā. Finding no go,
Candramatī said to her husband. “My Lord! sell me to
some one and clear off this debt.” The King with tears
agreed to this proposal. Because of their woe and
misery, both fell on the ground and fainted. The child
sat near them hungry and crying. Viśvāmitra stood near
them compelling them to pay the amount. When Hariś-
candra came to himself, he sold his beloved wife to a
Brahmin in the village close by. The Brahmin who
bought Candramatī was Viśvāmitra. Hariścandra was
not aware of this. After counting out a crore of gold
pieces in a cloth and placing it on the ground Viśvā-
mitra caught hold of Candramatī by her hair and
dragged her away. He bought the crying child also
paying its price. The Brahmin led the mother and the
child, beating and dragging them along, like animals.
They disappeared from the sight of the King.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra again came before Hariścandra and asked
for the money. Hariścandra gave Viśvāmitra, all the
money he got. The hermit was not satisfied. Viśvāmitra
said that the money given, was not an adequate amount
as dakṣiṇā when the importance of the great sacrifice
Rājasūya was considered and that if he was to get the
full benefit of the sacrifice he had to satisfy him by
[Page875-a+ 65]
giving him the requisite amount. The King accepted
everything the hermit said without any objection.
Viśvāmitra compelled him for payment. The King
requested for time. Viśvāmitra allowed time till sunset
that day.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as Viśvāmitra had gone Hariścandra walked
on with bent head, calling out. “Does anybody want
me? Will anybody buy me for price?” Instantly
Yamadharma came there as an outcaste and bought
Hariścandra. The name of the outcaste was Pravīra.
He bought Hariścandra to guard the funeral ground
and to collect tax on dead bodies. Viśvāmitra quickly
ran to the place. The outcaste gave Viśvāmitra ten
yojanas of land which yielded jewels, in the region of
Prayāga and severed his connection. Viśvāmitra went
on his way. The outcaste King took Hariścandra to
the funeral ground. Day and night Hariścandra had to
guard the entrance of the funeral ground.
<div n="NI"/>At this juncture Hariścandra's son died of snake bite,
while he was playing with other children on the bank
of the Ganges. His mother Candramatī fainted and
fell down, the moment she heard about it. As soon as
she recovered, she lamented over the death of her son
for a long time. Then she requested her master for
permission to go and see the dead body of her son. But
she was not given permission. She repeatedly pleaded
crying all the while. Then the Brahmin, her master, got
angry and said. “You slave! If your son it dead, let
him be dead. Is it any loss to you? It is my money
that is lost. You go and do your work. If not I will
operate this whip well on you. Remember that. You
know the biting pain of this whip. Stop wailing and
lamenting.”
<div n="NI"/>Candramatī persisted in her request to allow her to go
and see the dead body of her son. Not only did he
refuse to allow her to see the dead body of her son, but
also beat her. With tears she turned to her duties. It
was night. The Brahmin took his meals and lay down
to sleep. Candramatī was sitting at his feet massaging
his legs. When it was nearly midnight that stone-hearted
old Brahmin said. “Now you may go. Complete the
funeral and return before dawn. Your usual work in the
morning should not be left undone. If so, you know
the consequences.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing these words, Candramatī ran to the place
where the dead body of her son lay. The son lay on the
grass dead and stiff, with the face and body turned blue
due to poison. She saw that face in the flash of a light-
ning. She cried aloud. Hearing the cry people of the
neighbouring houses ran to the spot. Candramatī did
not give any reply to their questions Some thought her
to be a ghost. Some wanted to kill her. Some caught
her by the hair. Some struck at her. At last they tied
her with a rope and dragged her to the funeral place.
They asked Hariścandra who was standing there, to
cut her into pieces. He refused to kill a woman. The
outcaste King came there and giving Hariścandra a big
sword asked him again and again to cut her into pieces.
Candramatī and Hariścandra did not recognize each
other. At last, finding it difficult to disobey his master,
Hariścandra raised the sword to cut her.
<div n="NI"/>Then Candramatī shouted. “You outcaste. My son is
lying dead on the bank of the Ganges near this town.
Let me bring his body and cremate it. Allow me this
much time. After that I will come and sit here to be
[Page875-b+ 65]
cut into pieces by you.” Hariścandra agreed to it. Crying
all the way Candramatī went to the bank of the Ganges
and brought the dead body of her son to the cremation
place. Seeing her pitiable condition Hariścandra went
close to the dead body and removing the shroud looked
at the corpse. Because of poison the body of the child
was blue and ugly and as Hariścandra and Candramatī
had undergone so thorough a change they did not
recognize each other. But from her lamentation and
talk, he understood that the woman was his wife
Candramatī. He also cried aloud. Candramatī recogniz-
ed her husband. Still Hariścandra said that if the
child was cremated without collecting the usual fee, it
would be deceiving his master. At last both of them
decided to commit suicide before the night ended.
<div n="NI"/>Without loss of time Hariścandra gathered half-burned
fire-wood, and built a pile big enough to burn the
child's body and for them to jump into it. He laid the
child on it and set fire to it. Hariścandra and Candra-
matī stood with closed eyes ready to jump into the
burning fire. Then Brahmā appeared there and pre-
vented them from jumping into the fire. Indra and the
Devas showered Amṛta (Ambrosia). The child came to
life and got out of the fire. The King and the queen re-
gained their shining bodies and royal garments and
ornaments. The outcaste who was the master of Hariś-
candra was really, Dharmadeva. All the Devas blessed
Hariścandra and Viśvāmitra returned the kingdom to
the truthful Hariścandra. Their subjects were overjoyed
at the return of their King and queen. After that Rohita
was anointed as the King of Ayodhyā and the Devas
went with Hariścandra to heaven. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 7).

<div n="NI"/>7) {%Weapon Training.%} Viśvāmitra had proficiency in wield-
ing all types of weapons. He taught Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
all that he knew about weapons. See under Astra.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Cursing Rambhā.%} Once Viśvāmitra was doing very
severe penance. Indra feared him. So wishing to hinder
the penance of Viśvāmitra somehow Indra called
Rambhā to him and said to her. “Rambhā, you dress
well and dance before Viśvāmitra. Somehow his pen-
ance must be hindered. I shall take the form of a
cuckoo, and help you by singing.”
<div n="NI"/>Indra and Rambhā reached the forest of penance. The
cuckoo began to sing and there was the atmosphere of
spring season. Rambhā danced before Viśvāmitra. The
concentration of the hermit was broken. The hermit got
angry and cursed Rambhā and changed her into a rock.
She entreated for redemption from the curse. The her-
mit told her that after ten thousand years a Brahmin
named Bhūritejas would touch the rock, by which touch
she would get her original form. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 64).

<div n="NI"/>11) {%Cursing Vidyutprabhā.%} Once Viśvāmitra did penance
to obtain the position of Kubera, who employed the
celestial maid Vidyutprabhā to obstruct the penance of
Viśvāmitra. She came to the forest in which Viśvāmitra
was doing penance and tried to entice the hermit by
her beauty. But when she saw that her beauty did not
attract the hermit, she assumed a fearful form. Seeing
[Page876-a+ 63]
this form, the hermit cursed her. “You shall retain this
fearful form and live like a giantess.” She requested for
redemption. The hermit said that when Śrīdatta, the
son of Kālanemi, touched her hair she would be re-
deemed from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>After many years Kālanemi was born in the country of
Mālava as the son of a brahmin named Yajñasena. A
son named Śrīdatta was born to this Kālanemi. Once
Śrīdatta happened to see this giantess in a forest and
caught hold of her by the hair. Instantly she got her
original form. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka,
Taraṅga 2).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Stealing the flesh of a dog.%} Once, at the end of
Tretā Yuga and the beginning of Dvāpara Yuga,
there was no rain for twelve years. Famine prevailed
every-where. The people were in utter want and misery.
Hermits left their hermitages and wandered about. In
a crowd Viśvāmitra lost his wife and children and
entered a forest and travelled all alone. He entered the
hut of a low-caste (Paraya) and begged for food. But
none of them even talked to him. He again requested
for something to eat. Nobody cared for him. The her-
mit fell on the veranda due to weakness.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra saw in the hut some decayed flesh and intes-
tine of a dog placed in a corner of the kitchen. He de-
cided to steal some of it to appease his hunger. The
Caṇḍālas slept when the night advanced. But the lord
of the house lay pretending to sleep. Viśvāmitra slowly
entered the kitchen, and opened the pot in which the
intestine of the dog was kept. The owner of the house
asked, “Who is that?” Viśvāmitra replied that he had
stolen because of his hunger. The eyes of the caṇḍāla
were filled with tears because of pity. He said:
<Poem>“Dog is lower than jackal,
That is what men say,
Of all the parts of its body,
the lowest is its posterior.”</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Though he said so, he felt glad since he had given
Viśvāmitra food. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 141).

given in Chapter 4, Anuśāsana Parva.

composed by the Viśvāmitra-family. Variations are
observed in the two versions of statements about Viśvā-
mitra, occurring in Ṛgveda and the Purāṇas. The con-
frontations between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra occur in
Ṛgveda also. The last four sections of Sūkta 15 of
Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 3, Anuvāka 4, are meant to scold
Vasiṣṭha. Here Viśvāmitra curses Vasiṣṭha's family in
various ways. In the ‘Annotations of Sāyaṇa’, mention
is made that the disciples of Vasiṣṭha freed Viśvāmitra
from the vow of silence, and that instantly these mantras
(chants) dawned in his mind. Though the enmity bet-
ween Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra is seen in Ṛgveda, such
elaborate stories as seen in the Purāṇas do not occur in
Ṛgveda. But Viśvāmitra procured a prominent place in
Ṛgveda because this hermit rescued Sudāsa from danger
and forded him across rivers, and took Śunaśśepha as
his son. Of these two incidents the first is not given
much importance in the Purāṇas. Though the second
one occurs in the Purāṇas, the version is different from
[Page876-b+ 64]
that of Ṛgveda. From this it is presumed that the stories
taken from Ṛgveda underwent a thorough change before
they appeared in the Purāṇas.
