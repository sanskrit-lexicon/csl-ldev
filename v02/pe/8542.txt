VIŚVĀMITRA¦. A royal hermit of immense attainments.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Brahmā in the following
<div n="lb"/>order Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>-Vijaya—Hotraka—Jahnu—Puru—Balāka—Ajaka—
<div n="lb"/>Kuśa—Kuśanābha—Gādhi—Viśvāmitra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Six beautiful daughters were born to Kuśa-
<div n="lb"/>nābha the son of King Kuśa. The hermit Brahmadatta
<div n="lb"/>married them. After this a son named Gādhi was born
<div n="lb"/>to Kuśanābha. Two children named Satyavatī and
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra were born to Gādhi. Satyavatī was married
<div n="lb"/>to Ṛcīka; As he was born in the family of the famous
<div n="lb"/>king Kuśa, Viśvāmitra got the name Kauśika also. His
<div n="lb"/>kingdom was Kānyakubja. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa, Sarga 34).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Becoming a hermit.%} Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha were
<div n="lb"/>two hermits who were hostile to each other throughout
<div n="lb"/>their lives. A quarrel with Vasiṣṭha, persuaded
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra to become a hermit.
<div n="NI"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 51).
[Page872-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>The hermit Vasiṣṭha erected his hermitage and did
<div n="lb"/>penance in the country of Viśvāmitra. Once, while
<div n="lb"/>engaged in hunting Viśvāmitra saw Nandinī in the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Vasiṣṭha, and wanted to have her. In the
<div n="lb"/>battle which ensued between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra,
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Vasiṣṭha came out victorious. The ashamed
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra gave up his kingdom and went to forest
<div n="lb"/>to do penance. Viśvāmitra became a royal hermit of
<div n="lb"/>great attainments. There were constant confrontations
<div n="lb"/>between the Rājarṣi and the Brahmarṣi (King-hermit
<div n="lb"/>and Brahmin-hermit). (For the detailed story of the
<div n="lb"/>quarrels between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha see under
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, para 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Viśvāmitra and Hariścandra.%} The histories of Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra, Vasiṣṭha and Hariścandra are intertwined as a
<div n="lb"/>triple string. Viśvāmitra made Hariścandra, the most
<div n="lb"/>renowned of the men of veracity, go begging.
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra and Viśvāmitra. Their history begins from
<div n="lb"/>King Triśaṅku of the Solar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>Formerly the name of Triśaṅku was Satyavrata. Aruṇa
<div n="lb"/>was the father of Satyavrata. When Aruṇa was reigning
<div n="lb"/>the prince Satyavrata was leading a wicked life. He
<div n="lb"/>once entered the wedding hall of a Brahmin and carried
<div n="lb"/>away the bride by force. When the king knew this, he
<div n="lb"/>expelled the prince from the palace. Vasiṣṭha, as the
<div n="lb"/>family priest, was behind the cruelty on the part of the
<div n="lb"/>king towards his son. It was because of this that Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra crossed the path of Satyavrata.
<div n="NI"/>Satyavrata went to the forest and lived like a low-caste
<div n="lb"/>man. King Aruṇa repented his rashness. Entrusting his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom to Vasiṣṭha, Aruṇa went to the forest to do pen-
<div n="lb"/>ance. For twelve years there was no rain in the country.
<div n="lb"/>Famine broke out. Viśvāmitra's wife and three children
<div n="lb"/>were in great difficulty. The hermit had been engaged
<div n="lb"/>in penance. So the wife of the hermit decided to sell
<div n="lb"/>the middle son for the sake of maintaining the rest and
<div n="lb"/>started for the market with her children. On
<div n="lb"/>the way Satyavrata met them and learned the whole
<div n="lb"/>story. He told her not to sell the child. He agreed to
<div n="lb"/>give them food till the arrival of Viśvāmitra. The agree-
<div n="lb"/>ment was that he would tie the meat, obtained by hunt-
<div n="lb"/>ing, to a tree outside the hermitage, every day. Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata carried out the promise. One day he did not get
<div n="lb"/>anything from hunting. He caught hold of Vasiṣṭha's
<div n="lb"/>cow which had been grazing in the forest and killed it
<div n="lb"/>and gave its flesh to the family of Viśvāmitra. On com-
<div n="lb"/>ing to know this Vasiṣṭha cursed him and changed his
<div n="lb"/>form into that of a caṇḍāla (low-caste). Moreover, as
<div n="lb"/>he had incurred three sins such as stealing of a bride,
<div n="lb"/>anger of father and cow-slaughter, he came to be
<div n="lb"/>called Triśaṅku from that day onwards. Weighed down
<div n="lb"/>by these sins, he tried to commit suicide. Devī appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him and gave him back his original form and
<div n="lb"/>his kingdom.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of Aruṇa, Triśaṅku assumed the reign.
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra was his son. After giving the country to his
<div n="lb"/>son, Triśaṅku requested Vasiṣṭha to perform the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>to send him to heaven bodily. Vasiṣṭha said that it was
<div n="lb"/>impossible for him. Vasiṣṭha's enemy Viśvāmitra took
<div n="lb"/>up the task. He lifted Triśaṅku bodily, up to heaven.
<div n="lb"/>But he was denied admittance in heaven and so Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra created an artificial heaven between the earth
<div n="lb"/>and heaven and made Triśaṅku stay there.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra was keeping up hostile attitude towards the
[Page873-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>kings of the Solar dynasty. In reality it was not the
<div n="lb"/>hostility towards the Solar dynasty, but it was his
<div n="lb"/>enmity against Vasiṣṭha. Viśvāmitra did not like
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha's being the family-priest of the kings of the
<div n="lb"/>Solar dynasty. So Viśvāmitra kept up an attitude of
<div n="lb"/>antipathy towards them. This is the background of the
<div n="lb"/>quarrel between Hariścandra and Viśvāmitra.
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra took Candramatī, the daughter of Śibi,
<div n="lb"/>as his first wife. Besides her, he had ninetynine wives.
<div n="lb"/>But they had no children. At last according to the
<div n="lb"/>advice of Vasiṣṭha he went to the basin of the Ganges
<div n="lb"/>and did penance before Varuṇa. Viśvāmitra did not
<div n="lb"/>like this. Varuṇa appeared and said that Hariścandra
<div n="lb"/>would get a son. The king had promised that he would
<div n="lb"/>give his son as a sacrificial animal to Varuṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Candramatī became pregnant and delivered a son. He
<div n="lb"/>was named Rohitāśva. Even after the lapse of a month,
<div n="lb"/>the son was not given to Varuṇa. On several occasions
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa demanded the child; and Hariścandra would
<div n="lb"/>give some excuses. Finally the king agreed to hand
<div n="lb"/>him over to Varuṇa at the age of eleven after his
<div n="lb"/>Upanayana (investiture with the Brahma string). The
<div n="lb"/>boy completed his tenth year. Preparations were being
<div n="lb"/>made in the palace, for Upanayana, when Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>arrived. The prince, who was aware of the fact that his
<div n="lb"/>father would sacrifice him after his Upanayana, ran
<div n="lb"/>away from the palace at night. Varuṇa asked the king
<div n="lb"/>to hand over the boy to him. The king was in great
<div n="lb"/>perplexity. Varuṇa cursed the king that he would catch
<div n="lb"/>the disease called Jalodara (dropsy). Thus the king be-
<div n="lb"/>came a sick man. Rohitāśva heard from travellers that
<div n="lb"/>his father was ill. On many occasions he wanted to
<div n="lb"/>return to the palace. But Indra appeared before him in
<div n="lb"/>the form of a Brahmin and dissuaded him from
<div n="lb"/>going to the palace.
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra called Vasiṣṭha and asked him to suggest
<div n="lb"/>a remedy for this woe and misery. Vasiṣṭha advised
<div n="lb"/>him to fulfil somehow or other, the promise made to
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa. The hermit continued. “Sons are of ten types.
<div n="lb"/>A son bought for price also is included in this. So it
<div n="lb"/>is enough if a son is bought for price and is sacrificed.
<div n="lb"/>Some Brahmin may be found, who will be willing to sell
<div n="lb"/>his son. If you please Varuṇa thus, you will be cured.”
<div n="NI"/>The King was delighted to hear this. He instruct-
<div n="lb"/>ed his minister to find out any Brahmin who was will-
<div n="lb"/>ing to sell his son. A greedy Brahmin was found out.
<div n="lb"/>His name was Ajīgarta. He had three sons. He was
<div n="lb"/>prepared to sell the second son, Śunaśśepha. The minister
<div n="lb"/>agreed to give him hundred cows in return.
<div n="NI"/>Up to this time Viśvāmitra had been waging only a
<div n="lb"/>shadow war against the Kings of the Solar dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>From this moment he entered the scene of war. The
<div n="lb"/>minister bought Śunaśśepha and brought him to the
<div n="lb"/>palace. Viśvāmitra also arrived at the palace. He
<div n="lb"/>sympathised with Śunaśśepha who was crying pitiably.
<div n="lb"/>He asked the King to release the boy, and gave a
<div n="lb"/>warning that if the boy was not set free, the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>would be obstructed. The King said that he was doing
<div n="lb"/>so to get recovery from illness, that he would give Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra a good deal of wealth, and requested him not to
<div n="lb"/>cause any hindrance to the sacrifice. These words and
<div n="lb"/>the misery of the boy kindled the anger of Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>He called Śunaśśepha and taught him Varuṇamantra
<div n="lb"/>(spell) and told him to repeat the mantra when he was
<div n="lb"/>lying on the slaughter-stone and that he would escape
[Page873-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>death. Śunaśśepha did as he was told. Varuṇa became
<div n="lb"/>pleased with him and appearing before the King said,
<div n="lb"/>“Leave Śunaśśepha and perform the sacrifice. You will
<div n="lb"/>get recovery.” Saying so Varuṇa disappeared. Immedi-
<div n="lb"/>ately the King was cured of his disease. At the order of
<div n="lb"/>the King Śunaśśepha was set free. The sound ‘Jaya Jaya’
<div n="lb"/>(victory) reverberated in the sacrificial hall. Śunaśśepha
<div n="lb"/>got up and asked. “Oh great men. Who is my father
<div n="lb"/>now? Some said that it was Ajīgarta. Some others
<div n="lb"/>argued that it was Hariścandra. Some said that it was
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa.” At this time Vasiṣṭha stood up and said.
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, great men, please stop arguing. I shall give reply
<div n="lb"/>in accordance with the convention of Vedas. When he
<div n="lb"/>bargained on the price of his son and received the cost
<div n="lb"/>Ajīgarta lost his paternity. Thenceforward Hariścandra
<div n="lb"/>who bought the boy became his father. From the
<div n="lb"/>moment he had issued orders to bind the boy and place
<div n="lb"/>him on the slaughter-stone, he also had lost his paternity.
<div n="lb"/>The claim of Varuṇa to his paternity, because the boy
<div n="lb"/>had been saved from death by him, does not hold good.
<div n="lb"/>Any god will be pleased, when praised and glorified
<div n="lb"/>with great laudatory mantras and will confer upon the
<div n="lb"/>supplicant wealth, life, cow, land, salvation etc. There
<div n="lb"/>is nothing unusual in this. But it was Viśvāmitra who
<div n="lb"/>taught him the Varuṇa-spell in his pitiable and danger-
<div n="lb"/>ous situation. So Viśvāmitra alone has claim to the
<div n="lb"/>boy's paternity.”
<div n="NI"/>Those who were present, accepted this decision.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately Viśvāmitra took Śunaśśepha with him and
<div n="lb"/>went to his hermitage. Hearing about the recovery of
<div n="lb"/>the King, Rohitāśva returned to the palace from the
<div n="lb"/>forest. Hariścandra received him with tears of joy. The
<div n="lb"/>King, with his wife and son led a happy life and ruled
<div n="lb"/>over his subjects with justice and truth. At this time,
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra (of Kakutstha's family) accepting Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>as the main priest performed the famous sacrifice of
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya (Royal) consecration with ceremonies and
<div n="lb"/>festivities. With this the fame of Hariścandra spread
<div n="lb"/>far and wide.
<div n="NI"/>At this point begins the next stage of confrontation
<div n="lb"/>between Viśvāmitra and Hariścandra. Vasiṣṭha once
<div n="lb"/>reached heaven. Viśvāmitra also reached there at the
<div n="lb"/>same time. The devas greeted both honourably. But
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra saw that Vasiṣṭha was shown some parti-
<div n="lb"/>ality. This was unpalatable to Viśvāmitra, who asked
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. “What excellence have you, more than I?”
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha replied. ‘Have you not heard about Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra, the King of the Solar dynasty? It is the noblest
<div n="lb"/>dynasty in the world. The family priesthood of this
<div n="lb"/>dynasty also is laudable. My disciple Hariścandra of
<div n="lb"/>that royal family has recently performed the sacrifice of
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya. I was the Supreme priest of the function.
<div n="lb"/>This is a covetable position not attainable to many.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, there is none in the world, more truthful,
<div n="lb"/>firm of character, more charitable and more liberal than
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra. This is a fact.”
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra got up angrily and argued that Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra was not truthful. He staked all the fruits of
<div n="lb"/>his penance to prove this. From that day onwards Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra began to make moves to instigate Hariścandra to
<div n="lb"/>deviate from the path of truth.
<div n="NI"/>Once Hariścandra, while he was hunting, met a lonely
<div n="lb"/>woman in the forest. She was moaning. The King
<div n="lb"/>asked why she was lamenting. She replied. “Oh King.
<div n="lb"/>I am Siddhirūpiṇī (a goddess who helps people to attain
[Page874-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>anything). Viśvāmitra is doing penance to possess me. I
<div n="lb"/>request you to protect me.” The King promised her to
<div n="lb"/>see that she was not subjected to the molestation of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra any longer. After that Hariścandra went to
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage of Viśvāmitra and made an enquiry. He
<div n="lb"/>then asked the hermit to stop penance, as his severe,
<div n="lb"/>intense, penance was harmful to many people in the
<div n="lb"/>country. The King returned to the palace. Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>got angry and stood up. Up to this time only a cold war
<div n="lb"/>existed between them. Hostility became open now.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra began to make moves against Hariścandra
<div n="lb"/>quickly. He changed a fierce asura into a hog and sent
<div n="lb"/>it to the garden of Hariścandra. The hog destroyed the
<div n="lb"/>garden. All the attempts made by the guards to drive
<div n="lb"/>the hog away ended in failure. They informed the King.
<div n="lb"/>The King mounted on a horse and with weapons
<div n="lb"/>started for the garden. Without paying any heed to
<div n="lb"/>the arrows of the King, the hog ran away. The King
<div n="lb"/>began to chase it. The hog seemed to be near. Then it
<div n="lb"/>was away, then in front of the King and suddenly it
<div n="lb"/>appeared behind him. Then it would disappear
<div n="lb"/>instantly. In this manner the hog played around the
<div n="lb"/>King. After a while, the King was separated from his
<div n="lb"/>army and was entrapped, all alone, in a thick forest. He
<div n="lb"/>did not find any way out. He lost his way in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>As he was thus walking slowly, he saw a stream of pure
<div n="lb"/>water in front of him. Both the King and the horse drank
<div n="lb"/>from the stream. As he was standing thus without know-
<div n="lb"/>ing the way to return home, Viśvāmitra went to him in
<div n="lb"/>the guise of an old Brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>The King honoured the old man, and told him that he
<div n="lb"/>was Hariścandra, the King of Ayodhyā, and that by
<div n="lb"/>chasing a hog which destroyed his garden, he had
<div n="lb"/>reached the forest. He continued telling the old Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>who had helped him. “You might have heard that
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra, the King of Ayodhyā, had performed the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice Rājasūya. I am that same King. It is my vow
<div n="lb"/>to give anybody what he asks for. If you want money
<div n="lb"/>or anything for sacrifice or for any other purpose, just
<div n="lb"/>come to Ayodhyā. I will give you whatever you want.”
<div n="lb"/>The old man was pleased. He told the King that the
<div n="lb"/>jungle-stream flowed through a holy place and that
<div n="lb"/>it would be better to offer the gift after taking a bath
<div n="lb"/>in the river. The King purified himself by bathing in
<div n="lb"/>the river and then said. “Sir, I am ready to offer gifts.
<div n="lb"/>State your needs. It is my vow to give what is requested.
<div n="lb"/>At the time of the Rājasūya I acted so towards all of
<div n="lb"/>you and took a vow that I would do so in future also. I
<div n="lb"/>am glad because I have met you on the bank of this
<div n="lb"/>holy stream. So tell me quickly what you want.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmin:—“Oh King, I have heard about your fame.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover there is nobody in the world equal to Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra, born of the Solar dynasty, the son of Triśaṅku
<div n="lb"/>in liberality. Such is the opinion of hermit Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>There is nothing more to know about you, oh, King,
<div n="lb"/>who is such a man of liberality. I have only one desire.
<div n="lb"/>The marriage of my son is being conducted. I do not
<div n="lb"/>possess enough money for the marriage. I want only a
<div n="lb"/>help for the same.” The King thought it to be a very
<div n="lb"/>simple request, and promised to give the required
<div n="lb"/>amount. Viśvāmitra by illusion customary to Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>created a young man and a young woman, and showed
<div n="lb"/>them to the King saying that they were his son and
<div n="lb"/>daughter. Then the Brahmin who was delighted by the
<div n="lb"/>promise, showed the King the way to the palace.
[Page874-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>After making all arrangements for the marriage, Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra approached King Hariścandra. The King asked
<div n="lb"/>him what amount he required. “Give me your kingdom
<div n="lb"/>with all the elephants, horses, chariots, jewels and
<div n="lb"/>wealth in it”, said Viśvāmitra. The King who had
<div n="lb"/>been led to this deception by Viśvāmitra, having no go,
<div n="lb"/>agreed. Thus Viśvāmitra obtained the kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>everything that Hariścandra possessed. It is conven-
<div n="lb"/>tional that whenever a gift is given to Brahmins, a
<div n="lb"/>dakṣiṇā (monetary gift) also should be given along
<div n="lb"/>with it. Otherwise the gift will be futile. The King
<div n="lb"/>asked the Brahmin what he wanted as dakṣiṇā. He
<div n="lb"/>demanded two and a half Bhāras of gold as dakṣiṇā.
<div n="lb"/>The King agreed to give that also. But where to get
<div n="lb"/>this amount from, since he had lost his kingdom and
<div n="lb"/>everything? Having sunk deep in misery due to the
<div n="lb"/>deceit of Viśvāmitra, the King sat on the soil, cursing
<div n="lb"/>his fate. Seeing this, the queen ran to him and cried.
<div n="lb"/>While he was telling his wife every thing, Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>came there and said:
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra:—“Hariscandra! According to the gift
<div n="lb"/>hand over your country and everything instantly. I
<div n="lb"/>must have the dakṣiṇā of two and a half Bhāras of gold
<div n="lb"/>also just now.”
<div n="NI"/>Hariścandra:—“Sir! According to my promise receive
<div n="lb"/>everything now. We are leaving the country instantly.
<div n="lb"/>But since I have given you everything that I had, how
<div n="lb"/>can I give you dakṣiṇā? Everything I had, has become
<div n="lb"/>yours. The amount for dakṣiṇā has yet to be procured.
<div n="lb"/>So receive the gift now. The dakṣiṇā shall be given as
<div n="lb"/>early as possible.”
<div n="NI"/>After giving everything to the hermit, the King left the
<div n="lb"/>country with only the cloth he had been wearing. His
<div n="lb"/>wife and child followed him. The hermit also follow-
<div n="lb"/>ed the King compelling him to give him the dakṣiṇā.
<div n="lb"/>The King told him that only after paying this debt
<div n="lb"/>would he eat any food, and that he would pay the
<div n="lb"/>amount within a month. Viśvāmitra, unwillingly agreed
<div n="lb"/>to this.
<div n="NI"/>With his wife Candramatī and his young son, Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra reached Kāśī. After a month Viśvāmitra came
<div n="lb"/>to Kāśī for the amount of dakṣiṇā. Finding no go,
<div n="lb"/>Candramatī said to her husband. “My Lord! sell me to
<div n="lb"/>some one and clear off this debt.” The King with tears
<div n="lb"/>agreed to this proposal. Because of their woe and
<div n="lb"/>misery, both fell on the ground and fainted. The child
<div n="lb"/>sat near them hungry and crying. Viśvāmitra stood near
<div n="lb"/>them compelling them to pay the amount. When Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra came to himself, he sold his beloved wife to a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin in the village close by. The Brahmin who
<div n="lb"/>bought Candramatī was Viśvāmitra. Hariścandra was
<div n="lb"/>not aware of this. After counting out a crore of gold
<div n="lb"/>pieces in a cloth and placing it on the ground Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra caught hold of Candramatī by her hair and
<div n="lb"/>dragged her away. He bought the crying child also
<div n="lb"/>paying its price. The Brahmin led the mother and the
<div n="lb"/>child, beating and dragging them along, like animals.
<div n="lb"/>They disappeared from the sight of the King.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra again came before Hariścandra and asked
<div n="lb"/>for the money. Hariścandra gave Viśvāmitra, all the
<div n="lb"/>money he got. The hermit was not satisfied. Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>said that the money given, was not an adequate amount
<div n="lb"/>as dakṣiṇā when the importance of the great sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya was considered and that if he was to get the
<div n="lb"/>full benefit of the sacrifice he had to satisfy him by
[Page875-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>giving him the requisite amount. The King accepted
<div n="lb"/>everything the hermit said without any objection.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra compelled him for payment. The King
<div n="lb"/>requested for time. Viśvāmitra allowed time till sunset
<div n="lb"/>that day.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as Viśvāmitra had gone Hariścandra walked
<div n="lb"/>on with bent head, calling out. “Does anybody want
<div n="lb"/>me? Will anybody buy me for price?” Instantly
<div n="lb"/>Yamadharma came there as an outcaste and bought
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra. The name of the outcaste was Pravīra.
<div n="lb"/>He bought Hariścandra to guard the funeral ground
<div n="lb"/>and to collect tax on dead bodies. Viśvāmitra quickly
<div n="lb"/>ran to the place. The outcaste gave Viśvāmitra ten
<div n="lb"/>yojanas of land which yielded jewels, in the region of
<div n="lb"/>Prayāga and severed his connection. Viśvāmitra went
<div n="lb"/>on his way. The outcaste King took Hariścandra to
<div n="lb"/>the funeral ground. Day and night Hariścandra had to
<div n="lb"/>guard the entrance of the funeral ground.
<div n="NI"/>At this juncture Hariścandra's son died of snake bite,
<div n="lb"/>while he was playing with other children on the bank
<div n="lb"/>of the Ganges. His mother Candramatī fainted and
<div n="lb"/>fell down, the moment she heard about it. As soon as
<div n="lb"/>she recovered, she lamented over the death of her son
<div n="lb"/>for a long time. Then she requested her master for
<div n="lb"/>permission to go and see the dead body of her son. But
<div n="lb"/>she was not given permission. She repeatedly pleaded
<div n="lb"/>crying all the while. Then the Brahmin, her master, got
<div n="lb"/>angry and said. “You slave! If your son it dead, let
<div n="lb"/>him be dead. Is it any loss to you? It is my money
<div n="lb"/>that is lost. You go and do your work. If not I will
<div n="lb"/>operate this whip well on you. Remember that. You
<div n="lb"/>know the biting pain of this whip. Stop wailing and
<div n="lb"/>lamenting.”
<div n="NI"/>Candramatī persisted in her request to allow her to go
<div n="lb"/>and see the dead body of her son. Not only did he
<div n="lb"/>refuse to allow her to see the dead body of her son, but
<div n="lb"/>also beat her. With tears she turned to her duties. It
<div n="lb"/>was night. The Brahmin took his meals and lay down
<div n="lb"/>to sleep. Candramatī was sitting at his feet massaging
<div n="lb"/>his legs. When it was nearly midnight that stone-hearted
<div n="lb"/>old Brahmin said. “Now you may go. Complete the
<div n="lb"/>funeral and return before dawn. Your usual work in the
<div n="lb"/>morning should not be left undone. If so, you know
<div n="lb"/>the consequences.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing these words, Candramatī ran to the place
<div n="lb"/>where the dead body of her son lay. The son lay on the
<div n="lb"/>grass dead and stiff, with the face and body turned blue
<div n="lb"/>due to poison. She saw that face in the flash of a light-
<div n="lb"/>ning. She cried aloud. Hearing the cry people of the
<div n="lb"/>neighbouring houses ran to the spot. Candramatī did
<div n="lb"/>not give any reply to their questions Some thought her
<div n="lb"/>to be a ghost. Some wanted to kill her. Some caught
<div n="lb"/>her by the hair. Some struck at her. At last they tied
<div n="lb"/>her with a rope and dragged her to the funeral place.
<div n="lb"/>They asked Hariścandra who was standing there, to
<div n="lb"/>cut her into pieces. He refused to kill a woman. The
<div n="lb"/>outcaste King came there and giving Hariścandra a big
<div n="lb"/>sword asked him again and again to cut her into pieces.
<div n="lb"/>Candramatī and Hariścandra did not recognize each
<div n="lb"/>other. At last, finding it difficult to disobey his master,
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra raised the sword to cut her.
<div n="NI"/>Then Candramatī shouted. “You outcaste. My son is
<div n="lb"/>lying dead on the bank of the Ganges near this town.
<div n="lb"/>Let me bring his body and cremate it. Allow me this
<div n="lb"/>much time. After that I will come and sit here to be
[Page875-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>cut into pieces by you.” Hariścandra agreed to it. Crying
<div n="lb"/>all the way Candramatī went to the bank of the Ganges
<div n="lb"/>and brought the dead body of her son to the cremation
<div n="lb"/>place. Seeing her pitiable condition Hariścandra went
<div n="lb"/>close to the dead body and removing the shroud looked
<div n="lb"/>at the corpse. Because of poison the body of the child
<div n="lb"/>was blue and ugly and as Hariścandra and Candramatī
<div n="lb"/>had undergone so thorough a change they did not
<div n="lb"/>recognize each other. But from her lamentation and
<div n="lb"/>talk, he understood that the woman was his wife
<div n="lb"/>Candramatī. He also cried aloud. Candramatī recogniz-
<div n="lb"/>ed her husband. Still Hariścandra said that if the
<div n="lb"/>child was cremated without collecting the usual fee, it
<div n="lb"/>would be deceiving his master. At last both of them
<div n="lb"/>decided to commit suicide before the night ended.
<div n="NI"/>Without loss of time Hariścandra gathered half-burned
<div n="lb"/>fire-wood, and built a pile big enough to burn the
<div n="lb"/>child's body and for them to jump into it. He laid the
<div n="lb"/>child on it and set fire to it. Hariścandra and Candra-
<div n="lb"/>matī stood with closed eyes ready to jump into the
<div n="lb"/>burning fire. Then Brahmā appeared there and pre-
<div n="lb"/>vented them from jumping into the fire. Indra and the
<div n="lb"/>Devas showered Amṛta (Ambrosia). The child came to
<div n="lb"/>life and got out of the fire. The King and the queen re-
<div n="lb"/>gained their shining bodies and royal garments and
<div n="lb"/>ornaments. The outcaste who was the master of Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra was really, Dharmadeva. All the Devas blessed
<div n="lb"/>Hariścandra and Viśvāmitra returned the kingdom to
<div n="lb"/>the truthful Hariścandra. Their subjects were overjoyed
<div n="lb"/>at the return of their King and queen. After that Rohita
<div n="lb"/>was anointed as the King of Ayodhyā and the Devas
<div n="lb"/>went with Hariścandra to heaven. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Viśvāmitra and the brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.%} See
<div n="lb"/>under Rāma, Paras 5, 6, 7 and 8.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Weapon Training.%} Viśvāmitra had proficiency in wield-
<div n="lb"/>ing all types of weapons. He taught Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>all that he knew about weapons. See under Astra.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Cursing Rambhā.%} Once Viśvāmitra was doing very
<div n="lb"/>severe penance. Indra feared him. So wishing to hinder
<div n="lb"/>the penance of Viśvāmitra somehow Indra called
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā to him and said to her. “Rambhā, you dress
<div n="lb"/>well and dance before Viśvāmitra. Somehow his pen-
<div n="lb"/>ance must be hindered. I shall take the form of a
<div n="lb"/>cuckoo, and help you by singing.”
<div n="NI"/>Indra and Rambhā reached the forest of penance. The
<div n="lb"/>cuckoo began to sing and there was the atmosphere of
<div n="lb"/>spring season. Rambhā danced before Viśvāmitra. The
<div n="lb"/>concentration of the hermit was broken. The hermit got
<div n="lb"/>angry and cursed Rambhā and changed her into a rock.
<div n="lb"/>She entreated for redemption from the curse. The her-
<div n="lb"/>mit told her that after ten thousand years a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>named Bhūritejas would touch the rock, by which touch
<div n="lb"/>she would get her original form. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 64).

<div n="lb"/>Kadalīgarbhā.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Cursing Vidyutprabhā.%} Once Viśvāmitra did penance
<div n="lb"/>to obtain the position of Kubera, who employed the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maid Vidyutprabhā to obstruct the penance of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra. She came to the forest in which Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>was doing penance and tried to entice the hermit by
<div n="lb"/>her beauty. But when she saw that her beauty did not
<div n="lb"/>attract the hermit, she assumed a fearful form. Seeing
[Page876-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>this form, the hermit cursed her. “You shall retain this
<div n="lb"/>fearful form and live like a giantess.” She requested for
<div n="lb"/>redemption. The hermit said that when Śrīdatta, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Kālanemi, touched her hair she would be re-
<div n="lb"/>deemed from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>After many years Kālanemi was born in the country of
<div n="lb"/>Mālava as the son of a brahmin named Yajñasena. A
<div n="lb"/>son named Śrīdatta was born to this Kālanemi. Once
<div n="lb"/>Śrīdatta happened to see this giantess in a forest and
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of her by the hair. Instantly she got her
<div n="lb"/>original form. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāmukhalambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 2).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Stealing the flesh of a dog.%} Once, at the end of
<div n="lb"/>Tretā Yuga and the beginning of Dvāpara Yuga,
<div n="lb"/>there was no rain for twelve years. Famine prevailed
<div n="lb"/>every-where. The people were in utter want and misery.
<div n="lb"/>Hermits left their hermitages and wandered about. In
<div n="lb"/>a crowd Viśvāmitra lost his wife and children and
<div n="lb"/>entered a forest and travelled all alone. He entered the
<div n="lb"/>hut of a low-caste (Paraya) and begged for food. But
<div n="lb"/>none of them even talked to him. He again requested
<div n="lb"/>for something to eat. Nobody cared for him. The her-
<div n="lb"/>mit fell on the veranda due to weakness.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra saw in the hut some decayed flesh and intes-
<div n="lb"/>tine of a dog placed in a corner of the kitchen. He de-
<div n="lb"/>cided to steal some of it to appease his hunger. The
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍālas slept when the night advanced. But the lord
<div n="lb"/>of the house lay pretending to sleep. Viśvāmitra slowly
<div n="lb"/>entered the kitchen, and opened the pot in which the
<div n="lb"/>intestine of the dog was kept. The owner of the house
<div n="lb"/>asked, “Who is that?” Viśvāmitra replied that he had
<div n="lb"/>stolen because of his hunger. The eyes of the caṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>were filled with tears because of pity. He said:
<Poem>“Dog is lower than jackal,
<div n="lb"/>That is what men say,
<div n="lb"/>Of all the parts of its body,
<div n="lb"/>the lowest is its posterior.”</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Though he said so, he felt glad since he had given
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra food. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 141).
<div n="NI"/>13). {%Cursing the river Sarasvatī.%} See under Vasiṣṭha,
<div n="lb"/>para 2, sub-para 5.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Sons.%} Viśvāmitra had many sons. Their names are
<div n="lb"/>given in Chapter 4, Anuśāsana Parva.
<div n="NI"/>15). {%Viśvāmitra and Ṛgveda.%} Ṛgveda, Maṇdala 5, was
<div n="lb"/>composed by the Viśvāmitra-family. Variations are
<div n="lb"/>observed in the two versions of statements about Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra, occurring in Ṛgveda and the Purāṇas. The con-
<div n="lb"/>frontations between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra occur in
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda also. The last four sections of Sūkta 15 of
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 3, Anuvāka 4, are meant to scold
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. Here Viśvāmitra curses Vasiṣṭha's family in
<div n="lb"/>various ways. In the ‘Annotations of Sāyaṇa’, mention
<div n="lb"/>is made that the disciples of Vasiṣṭha freed Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>from the vow of silence, and that instantly these mantras
<div n="lb"/>(chants) dawned in his mind. Though the enmity bet-
<div n="lb"/>ween Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra is seen in Ṛgveda, such
<div n="lb"/>elaborate stories as seen in the Purāṇas do not occur in
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda. But Viśvāmitra procured a prominent place in
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda because this hermit rescued Sudāsa from danger
<div n="lb"/>and forded him across rivers, and took Śunaśśepha as
<div n="lb"/>his son. Of these two incidents the first is not given
<div n="lb"/>much importance in the Purāṇas. Though the second
<div n="lb"/>one occurs in the Purāṇas, the version is different from
[Page876-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>that of Ṛgveda. From this it is presumed that the stories
<div n="lb"/>taken from Ṛgveda underwent a thorough change before
<div n="lb"/>they appeared in the Purāṇas.
