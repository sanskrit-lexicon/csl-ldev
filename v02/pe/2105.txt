DRAVIḌA¦(M). (DRĀVIḌA). In ancient days the
<div n="lb"/>whole of South India was known by the name Tami-
<div n="lb"/>laka, as Tamil was the language used throughout South
<div n="lb"/>India. Strictly speaking, all the languages used in
<div n="lb"/>South India were given the name Tamil. The word
<div n="lb"/>‘Tamil’ underwent changes in the language of North
<div n="lb"/>India and took the form ‘Drāvida’. Etymologists are
<div n="lb"/>of opinion that the changes that took place in the word
<div n="lb"/>Tamil were are follows:- Tamil—Damil—Damiḍ-
<div n="lb"/>-Dramiḍ—Draviḍ—Drāviḍ. Reference to the
<div n="lb"/>Drāviḍa country occurs in most of the Purāṇas.
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata states that Sahadeva, one of the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas, sent a note for collecting taxes from the people of
<div n="lb"/>Drāvida. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 71.
<div n="NI"/>“There are other countries also in the southern Bhārata
<div n="lb"/>such as Dravida, Kerala, Prācya, Mūṣīka, Vanavāsīka
<div n="lb"/>Karṇāṭaka, Mahiṣaka, Vikalpa and Mūṣaka.” This
<div n="lb"/>statement (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9) throws
<div n="lb"/>light on the various countries which existed in South
<div n="lb"/>India at the time of Mahābhārata. In Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 10, it is mentioned that Kaṃsa, the uncle of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, was the son of Dramila, a gandharva. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Kaṃsa).
