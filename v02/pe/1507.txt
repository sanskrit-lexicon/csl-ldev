CATURTHĪVRATA¦. A fast undertaken so that one
<div n="lb"/>may be happy for one year, may achieve all desires and
<div n="lb"/>attain Śivaloka. While observing this fast one should
<div n="lb"/>worship Gaṇapati on the fourth day after New Moon
<div n="lb"/>(Caturthī) in the month of Makara (February-March).
<div n="lb"/>Next day the fast should be broken by eating cooked
<div n="lb"/>rice and oil seeds. The Mūlamantra of Gaṇapati is
<div n="lb"/>‘gaṃ svāhā’; hṛdayādiṣaḍaṅgas beginning with ‘gam’.
<div n="lb"/>‘Āgacchātikāya’ is the āvāhana mantra and ‘Gacchā-
<div n="lb"/>tikāya’ the visarjana mantra. Gaṇapati should be
<div n="lb"/>worshipped with mantras ending with ‘tuṅkāya’ and
<div n="lb"/>beginning with ‘gakāra’ as also with offering of sandal
<div n="lb"/>paste, rice balls etc. “Oṃ Mahotkāyāya vidmahe vakra-
<div n="lb"/>tuṇḍāya dhīmahi tanno dantī pracodayāt” is the Gaṇeśa
<div n="lb"/>gāyatrī mantra. He or she who performs the Caturthī
<div n="lb"/>vrata will attain Śivaloka. If Gaṇapati is worshipped
<div n="lb"/>on a Tuesday which is also Caturthī the devotee will
<div n="lb"/>get all his desires satisfied. Caturthī occurring in Mīna
<div n="lb"/>(March-April) is called Avighnacaturthī, and that day
<div n="lb"/>fasting should be in the night. On Caturthī in April-
<div n="lb"/>May Gaṇapati should be worshipped with damanaka
[Page179-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>flowers, and then the worshipper will become very
<div n="lb"/>happy. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 179). Also see Vināyaka
