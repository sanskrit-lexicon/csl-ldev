KṢUDRAKA¦. There was a country known as Kṣudraka
in Ancient India. Those who inhabited this country
were called Kṣudrakas. It is stated in Mahābhārata,
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 52 that the Kṣudrakas had
brought gifts to Dharmaputra. In the battle of Bhārata
Duryodhana protected Śakuni with the help of the
Kṣudrakas. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 16).
It is stated in Mahābhārata, Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 19
