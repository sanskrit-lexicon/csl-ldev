DĪKṢĀ¦. Dīkṣā is the vrata that expels sin and increases
<div n="lb"/>Jñāna (wisdom). Those who are to be blessed fall into
<div n="lb"/>three categories. The person who belongs to the first
<div n="lb"/>category is called Vijñānakala; the second is Pralaya-
<div n="lb"/>kala; and the third is Sakala. Vijñānakala is free from
<div n="lb"/>sin alone. Pralayakala is free from sins and Karmans.
<div n="lb"/>Sakala has everything from Kalā to the earth. The
<div n="lb"/>Dīkṣās to be practised by the three classes of persons
<div n="lb"/>are of different kinds. Dīkṣā is classified into two:
<div n="lb"/>“Nirādhāra and Sādhāra.
<div n="NI"/>Nirādhāra Dīkṣā is performed for the sake of Vijñāna-
<div n="lb"/>kala and Pralayakala. Sādhāra Dīkṣā is prescribed for
<div n="lb"/>the third class of people, the Sakalas.
