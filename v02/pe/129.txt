<div n="NI"/>1. {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā-
<div n="lb"/>Marīci-Kaśyapa-Ajāmukhī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth%} Long ago in the battle between Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Asuras one of the routed Asuras had fled to Pātāla (Hell).
<div n="lb"/>Surasā was his daughter. Brahmā's grandson, Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>married Surasā. She gave birth to six children—Śūrapa-
<div n="lb"/>dmā, Siṃhikā, Siṃhavaktra, Tārakāsura, Ajāmukhī, and
<div n="lb"/>Gomukha. The Asura woman Ajāmukhī is one of them.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Chief events.%} (1) {%Marriage with Durvāsas.%} Once
<div n="lb"/>Śūrapadmā called his two brothers, Siṃhavaktra and
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāsura and ordered them to set up two cities, one
<div n="lb"/>to the north and the other to the south, of Mahāmeru.
<div n="lb"/>In obedience to his elder brother, Tārakāsura started
<div n="lb"/>with one half of the army and set up a city to the south
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāmeru. That city was named Māyāpura. Siṃha-
<div n="lb"/>vaktra lived in the city on the northern side of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru. Their sister Ajāmukhī went about enticing men to
<div n="lb"/>satisfy her lustful passion. Once, in the course of her
<div n="lb"/>wanderings, she met Durvāsas in the Himālayan valley.
<div n="lb"/>They fell in love and even married. The two Asuras,
<div n="lb"/>Ilvala and Vātāpi were born from their union. They
<div n="lb"/>insisted on sharing their father's achievements between
<div n="lb"/>them. Durvāsas cursed them that they would die at the
<div n="lb"/>hands of Agastya. (Skanda Purāṇa, Asura Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%The cutting off of Ajāmukhī's hands.%} While wandering
<div n="lb"/>with her lustful passion, Ajāmukhī once went to the Śiva
<div n="lb"/>temple at Kāśi. There she happened to meet Indra's
<div n="lb"/>wife, Śacīdevī. In order to give her to her brother,
<div n="lb"/>Śūrapadmā, Ajāmukhī caught hold of Śacīdevī. Śacī-
<div n="lb"/>devī screamed aloud. Suddenly Śiva appeared there
<div n="lb"/>with His sword. Even then Ajāmukhī refused to release
<div n="lb"/>Śacīdevī. Śiva rescued Indrāṇī (Śacīdevī) by cutting off
<div n="lb"/>Ajāmukhī's hands. Hearing this, Śūrapadmā sent his
<div n="lb"/>army and imprisoned the Devas. The imprisoned
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā at the instance of Śūrapadmā, restored Aja-
<div n="lb"/>mukhī's hands. Śūrapadmā's son, Bhānugopa fought
<div n="lb"/>against the remaining Devas and defeated them. (Skanda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Asura Kāṇḍa).
