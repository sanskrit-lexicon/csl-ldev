ADṚṢṬABHAYA¦ is the curse put on King Janamejaya
by Saramā, the dog of the Devas. While Janamejaya,
son of Parīkṣit was conducting, along with his bro-
thers, a yāga of long duration at Kurukṣetra the son
of Saramā went to the place and was thrashed by
the brothers of Janamejaya. Seeing her weeping child
Saramā naturally got angry. She cursed the king
thus: “My son did not commit any offence; he did
not even look at the havis (oblations), nor did he
lick it. For having thrashed the innocent child you
will experience Adṛṣṭabhaya. When the yāga was
over Janamejaya got rid of the curse by getting sage
Somaśravas do certain proper rites.
