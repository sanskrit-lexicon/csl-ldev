ADṚṢṬABHAYA¦ is the curse put on King Janamejaya
<div n="lb"/>by Saramā, the dog of the Devas. While Janamejaya,
<div n="lb"/>son of Parīkṣit was conducting, along with his bro-
<div n="lb"/>thers, a yāga of long duration at Kurukṣetra the son
<div n="lb"/>of Saramā went to the place and was thrashed by
<div n="lb"/>the brothers of Janamejaya. Seeing her weeping child
<div n="lb"/>Saramā naturally got angry. She cursed the king
<div n="lb"/>thus: “My son did not commit any offence; he did
<div n="lb"/>not even look at the havis (oblations), nor did he
<div n="lb"/>lick it. For having thrashed the innocent child you
<div n="lb"/>will experience Adṛṣṭabhaya. When the yāga was
<div n="lb"/>over Janamejaya got rid of the curse by getting sage
<div n="lb"/>Somaśravas do certain proper rites.
