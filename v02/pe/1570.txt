CITRALEKHĀ II¦. A companion of Uṣā, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>the demon, Bāṇa. She was a beautiful portrait painter.
<div n="lb"/>Uṣā once dreamt of Aniruddha, grandson of Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Even before knowing the identity of the idol of her dream
<div n="lb"/>Uṣā fell in love with him. Next day morning Citra-
<div n="lb"/>lekhā gathered from the gloomy Uṣā details of her dream
<div n="lb"/>and Citralekhā started making portraits of many known
<div n="lb"/>charming princes but Uṣā was not satisfied. She then
<div n="lb"/>drew in her imagination a figure which was exactly like
<div n="lb"/>that of Aniruddha, the man of her dream. Uṣā was
<div n="lb"/>satisfied and it was through the cleverness of Chitralekhā
<div n="lb"/>that Aniruddha was brought to Uṣā's room and
<div n="lb"/>Uṣā was able to marry Aniruddha. (See under ‘Ani-
<div n="lb"/>ruddha’).
