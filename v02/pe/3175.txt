KALYĀṆA¦. A sage. Once certain Aṅgirases including
<div n="lb"/>this sage observed sattra (sacrifice) for the attainment
<div n="lb"/>of Heaven. But nobody was sure about the Devayāna
<div n="lb"/>path which leads to Heaven. So they selected Kalyāṇa
<div n="lb"/>to find out the path. He went in search of the
<div n="lb"/>Devayāna path and on the way he met Ūrṇāyu, a
<div n="lb"/>Gandharva who was in the company of some apsarā
<div n="lb"/>women. The gandharva disclosed the Sāma which
<div n="lb"/>would enable Kalyāṇa to find out the Devayāna path.
<div n="lb"/>On his return, Kalyāṇa told the other Ṛṣis that he
<div n="lb"/>had received the Sāma, but he refused to disclose from
<div n="lb"/>whom he obtained it. With the help of that Sāma
<div n="lb"/>known as Aurṇāyuva, the Aṅgirases attained Heaven,
<div n="lb"/>but because of his failure to disclose the whole truth,
<div n="lb"/>Kalyāṇa was denied access to Heaven. Besides that,
[Page378-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>he became a victim to the disease of leprosy. (Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇam).
