GARUḌA¦. King of birds.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā
-Marīci—Kaśyapa—Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of
Marīci married the eight daughters of Dakṣa called
Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu
and Analā. And to Tāmrā five daughters were born,
viz. Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī. Out
of the five women Krauñcī became mother of the owls,
Bhāsī delivered the bhāsas (types of birds) and from
Śyenī were born vultures and kites. Haṃsa, Kalahaṃsa,
Koka etc. are children of Dhṛtarāṣṭrī. From Śukī was
born Nalā and from Nalā, Vinatā; Aruṇa and Garuḍa
were the two sons born to Vinatā. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 15).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in the Mahābhārata about the birth of
Aruṇa and Garuḍa. Kaśyapa who was much pleased
with the service of Vinatā and Kadrū asked them to
select any boon they desired. Kadrū chose to have a
thousand nāgas as her children while Vinatā chose to
have two sons more powerful and heroic than the thou-
sand sons of Kadrū. After granting them the boon
Kaśyapa retreated into the forest.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Kadrū laid thousand eggs and Vinatā
two eggs. Both of them kept their eggs in hot pots. In
the 500th year the eggs of Kadrū hatched and thousand
serpents of various kinds emerged out of them. But
Vinatā's eggs did not hatch yet, and the sight of Kadrū
playing with her children pained Vinatā much. She,
therefore, broke open one of her eggs in secret, and a
half-grown child stepped out of it. That child was
Aruṇa. Aruṇa got angry that Vinatā forced open the
egg prematurely. He told her that as punishment there-
of she would become a slave of Kadrū. But, Aruṇa
granted her redemption from the curse thus: After an-
other 500 years the remaining egg of yours will hatch
and a son endowed with exceptional power and pro-
wess will be born to you. He will liberate you from
slavery.” After telling his mother so much Aruṇa rose
to the sky where he became the charioteer of the Sun.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 16. See also Para 6 infra).
<div n="NI"/>After 500 years the egg broke itself open and out came
Garuḍa with blazing effulgence, and he rose up in the
sky. His body glowed like the sun. The Devas who got
themselves dimmed by his effulgence asked Agnideva
the reason therefor. Agnideva told them about the
birth of Garuḍa and also that he was equally effulgent
as himself (Agnideva). Then all of them went to
Garuḍa and lavished on his head all possible blessings,
and Garuḍa, as requested by them, controlled his efful-
gence and returned to his mother. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 23).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Slavery of Vinatā:%} The churning of the Milk-ocean
was done before Garuḍa was born. Indra got a horse
named Uccaiḥśravas from the Ocean of Milk. Between
Kadrū and Vinatā a dispute arose as regards the colour
of the horse's tail, Kadrū saying that it was black while
Vinatā asserted that it was white. They further agreed
to test the colour the next day, betting that she who
was proved to be wrong would become the slave of the
victor. As the nāga sons of Kadrū hung on to the tail
[Page281-b+ 64]
of the horse the tail appeared to be black and Vinatā
lost the bet and became Kadrū's slave.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this juncture that Garuḍa was born, and he
felt highly mortified to find his mother working as a
slave of Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>Kadrū and her nāga sons once ordered Vinatā to carry
them to the nāga residence in the middle of the ocean,
called Rāmaṇīyaka (Ramaṇam). Accordingly Vinatā
carrying Kadrū on her shoulders and Garuḍa carrying
Kadrū's sons on his shoulders rose up in the sky. But,
Garuḍa did not relish the slavish work, and he, carry-
ing with him the nāgas, flew up to the sun's orbit. The
nāga children fainted due to the excessive heat. But, on
the request of Kadrū Indra sent heavy rain and the
nāgas regained consciousness. By then they had reached
Rāmaṇīyaka island.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Attempt at freeing Vinatā from thraldom.%} Garuḍa, ex-
tremely pained at the pitiable plight of his mother, one
day asked Kadrū what price she and her children
demanded for freeing Vinatā from slavery, and Kadrū
demanded Amṛta from Devaloka as the price.
Garuḍa decided to get it and informed his mother
about his decision to fly to Devaloka. But, what about
food till he reached Devaloka? Vinatā solved the pro-
blem by advising Garuḍa to eat the niṣādas he will
meet on his way to Devaloka at the island called
Niṣādālaya, at the same time specially forbidding him
from eating on any account, brahmins who might be
there, at Niṣādālaya. How to distinguish brahmins
from others, queried Garuḍa, and his mother replied
by pointing out that the brahmin will burn the throat
of him who tries to eat him, like fire. Then Vinatā
blessed her son that his wings would be protected by
Vāyu, the lower half of his body by sun and moon, the
rest of the body by the Vasus and the head by Agni.
She also promised to wait there till her son returned.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Garuḍa to Devaloka.%} After saluting his mother
Garuḍa set out on his quest for Amṛta. All the fourteen
worlds shook at the lashing of his wings. He reached
Niṣādālaya, where while consuming whole lots of Niṣā-
das a brahmin and his wife also happened to get into
his throat. Garuḍa felt their presence immediately in
his throat and requested them to get out of his mouth.
Accordingly they got out and also blessed Garuḍa, who
continued on his journey.
<div n="NI"/>Next Garuḍa reached the forest where his father
Kaśyapa was engaged in tapas. He told him about his
mission and requested him for something to eat.
Kaśyapa replied thus:—“You see a pool wherein an
elephant and a tortoise are living for long as enemies.
Long ago two brothers Vibhāvasu and Supratīka quar-
relled over their paternal wealth and at the height of
it Vibhāvasu cursed Supratīka to become an elephant
when Supratīka pronounced the counter curse that
Vibhāvasu should turn out to be a tortoise. You, my
son Garuḍa may eat that elephant and tortoise. May
your journey for Amṛta be crowned with success.
<div n="NI"/>Now, Garuḍa after saluting his father, flew up in the
sky carrying in his beak the elephant and the tortoise
from the pool. As trees were falling uprooted due to
the terrific vibrations caused by the lashing of his wings
Garuḍa did not find a convenient place to sit down to
eat his food. While continuing the journey Garuḍa saw
a big tree, its branches spread out in a circumference
[Page282-a+ 65]
of a hundred yojanas. But, as soon as Garuḍa set foot on
a branch of the tree it (branch) crumbled down. On
that broken branch were the sages called Bālakhilyas
doing tapas hanging their heads down. Fearing that the
sages might fall down Garuḍa continued his flight
holding in his beak the torn branch of the tree. But he
could not find a safe place to deposit the branch with
the sages. So he came again to Mount Gandhamādana
and saw Kaśyapa, who apologised to the Bālakhilyas
on behalf of his son and also explained to them about
his mission. The Bālakhilyas were pleased and they left
the place for the Himālayas. As advised by Kaśyapa
Garuḍa deposited the branch of the tree on an unin-
habited mountain peak. Garuḍa ate the elephant and
the tortoise there, and therefrom flew to Devaloka (Ādi
Parva, Chapter 29, 30).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Bālakhilyas cursed Indra.%} Even before the arrival of
Garuḍa ill omens began appearing in Devaloka. Indra
asked Bṛhaspati for explanation about the ill omens.
Bṛhaspati with his divine eyes saw Garuḍa approach-
ing Devaloka for Amṛta, and he told Indra about
Garuḍa born out of the powers of the tapas of Kaśyapa
and the Bālakhilyas. He also told that such a fate as
the present one befell Indra due to a curse of the
Bālakhilyas. Indra and the other Devas stood guard
over the pot of Amṛta ready to repel all possible
attacks.
<div n="NI"/>There was a reason for Garuḍa's birth from the powers
of the tapas of the Bālakhilyas, and also for Indra to
be put into the present predicament due to the curse
of the Bālakhilyas. Kaśyapaprajāpati, a long time ago,
began a terrific yajña for a son, and Indra and the
Bālakhilyas who numbered more than 60,000 were
deputed by Kaśyapa to collect firewood for the yajña.
The Bālakhilyas were only of the size of a thumb, and
Indra who very easily collected all the firewood needed
for the yajña laughed at the tiny Bālakhilyas who were
carrying small twigs etc. for firewood. Angered at the
insult the Bālakhilyas removed themselves to another
place nearby and began a yajña directed against Indra
who alarmed at it sought the help of Kaśyapa who then
held peace talks with the Bālakhilyas. They transferred
their yāgaśakti (yājñic powers) also to Kaśyapa and
agreed to be satisfied with the condition that as the
result of Kaśyapa's yajña a son should be born to him,
who (the son) would defeat Indra. Thus, for the time
being Indra escaped from the wrath of the Bālakhilyas.
After the yajña was over Vinatā came to Kaśyapa and
he blessed her with a son wishing that he should be-
come exceptionally strong and powerful, and that was
Garuḍa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Amṛtakalaśāpaharaṇam. (The pot of nectar carried%}
{%away).%} Garuḍa approached the pot of nectar, and
Viśvakarmā who attacked him first was felled to the
ground. The dust storm raised by the waving of
Garuḍa's wings blinded everybody. The Devas and
Indra, nay, even the sun and the Moon lined up
against Garuḍa, but he defeated them all, and entered
the particular place where the pot of nectar was kept.
Two terrific wheels were rotating round the pot and
they would cut into mince-meat anybody who tried to
lay hands on the pot and a machine circled the wheels.
Below the wheels were two monstrous serpents with
glowing eyes and protruding tongues like flashes of
fire, and the serpents never closed their eyes. The very
[Page282-b+ 65]
look with those eyes was enough to poison anyone to
death. Garuḍa blinded those eyes by raising a torrent
of dust, pierced them in the middle with his beak and
and through the hole, his body reduced to such a tiny
shape, went nearer to the pot. He destroyed the
wheels and the machine, and carrying the pot of nectar
in his beaks rose to the sky shielding the light of the
sun by his outspread wings. Mahāviṣṇu, who became so
much pleased with the tremendous achievements of
Garuḍa asked him to choose any boon. Garuḍa
requested Viṣṇu that he should be made his (Viṣṇu's)
vehicle and rendered immortal without his tasting
amṛta. Both the boons were granted.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Garuḍa and Indra became friends.%} Indra hit with the
Vajra (his special weapon) the wings of Garuḍa who
was returning from Viṣṇu. It did not wound his body,
but a feather of his fell in the atmosphere. Everybody
who saw the feather acclaimed Garuḍa as Suparṇa (he
with the good wings). Indra was wonder-struck, and
he approached Garuḍa and requested that they should
be friends in future and the pot of nectar be returned.
Garuḍa replied that the nectar would be returned if
he was granted the power to make nāgas his food, and
Indra blessed him that he would live by consuming
nāgas. And then Garuḍa told Indra thus: “I took this
pot of amṛta not for my own use. The nāgas cheated
my mother and made her a slave, and she will be freed
if only this pot of nectar is given to them (nāgas). You
may snatch off the pot from the nāgas; I shall not
object to it.”
<div n="NI"/>Indra and Garuḍa thus became friends and the former
followed Garuḍa on his way back home.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Garuḍa handed over the pot of amṛta to the nāgas and%}
{%Indra cheated them of it.%} Garuḍa handed over the pot of
nectar to the nāgas, who on the suggestion of the
former placed the pot on darbha grass spread on the
ground. Also, in accordance with Garuḍa's advice that
they should take a purificatory bath before tasting the
amṛta the nāgas went out to have the bath, and in
their absence Indra carried off the pot of nectar back
to Devaloka. Failing to find the pot of nectar on their
return from bath the aggrieved nāgas licked the darbha
on which the pot was placed with the result that their
tongues were cloven into two. It was from that day
onwards that the nāgas became double-tongued
(dvijihvas). And, thus Garuḍa redeemed his mother
from slavery. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 34).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The fig tree which Garuḍa broke with his beaks and%}
{%Laṅkā.%} It has been noted above that Garuḍa on his
way to Devaloka rested on a fig tree. That fig is
called Subhadra in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa saw the fig tree around which sages were sitting
and which bore marks made by Garuḍa sitting thereon.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 35, Verse
26).
<div n="NI"/>There is some connection between this tree and Laṅkā.
Garuḍa had, as directed by Kaśyapa, deposited in the
sea the branch of the tree on which the Bālakhilyas
hung in tapas and with which Garuḍa flew hither and
thither fearing about the safety of the Bālakhilyas. At
the spot in the sea where the branch was deposited
sprang up an island like the peak of a mountain. It
was this island which in after years became reputed as
Laṅkā. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāmukhalaṃbaka,
Taraṅga 4).
[Page283-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Garuḍa, Saubhari and Kāliya.%} Garuḍa had always
entertained great hatred against the nāgas, and now
Indra's permission having been obtained by him to eat
the nāgas for food, Garuḍa decided to launch a regular
nāga-hunting expedition. He began eating the nāgas
one by one. Alarmed at this the nāgas planned for their
security in a conclave, and approached Garuḍa with
the proposal that one nāga would go to him daily
to serve as his food instead of his indiscriminate killing
of them. Garuḍa accepted their proposal. After some
time the nāgas proposed to Garuḍa that they would
conduct a sarpa-bali (sacrifice of serpents) and submit
the food got out of the bali to him so that his nāga-
hunting might be stopped for ever. Garuḍa agreed to
this also. According to the new agreement daily one
nāga began going to Garuḍa with the food got
out of the bali.
<div n="NI"/>But Kāliya alone did not agree to the programme as he
did not recognise Garuḍa to be superior to him in
power. And, Garuḍa, who wanted to teach the haughty
Kāliya a lesson challenged him to fight, and the fight
took place in river Kālindī, Kāliya's abode. During
the fight the lashing of Garuḍa's wings raised the
water in Kālindī up in the sky and it drenched the
sage Saubhari all over, who was performing tapas on
the banks of Kālindī. Saubhari cursed that the body
of Garuḍa be shattered into a thousand pieces if ever
he entered that area in future, and thenceforth the
place became a prohibited area for Garuḍa. During
after years Kāliya was put up at this place.
<div n="NI"/>A kadamba tree alone outlived the effect of the poison
of Kāliya. The tree could outlive the deadly poison
because Garuḍa had rested on it on his way back from
Devaloka with amṛta. (Bhāgavata daśama Śkandha).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Relationship of Garuḍa with the kings of the solar%}
{%dynasty.%} King Sagara of the solar dynasty was married
to Sumati, the elder sister of Garuḍa, and there is a
story behind the marriage.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a king called Subāhu in the solar
dynasty. He married one Yādavī, but for many years
they had no issues. Yādavī had become old by the
time she conceived a child as the result of many
yajñas etc. But, Subāhu's other wives, viz. co-wives
of Yādavī, did not like the prospects of Yādavī
becoming a mother. They administered poison to her
with the result that Yādavī did not deliver in time,
but continued as a pregnant woman for seven years.
The sad couple, for their mental relief went into the
forest and lived as disciples of a sage called Aurva. But
Subāhu died rather soon and Yādavī prepared
herself to follow him in the funeral pyre. But, the
sage Aurva prevented her from self immolation speak-
ing to her thus: “You shall not act rashly. The child
in your womb will become a famous emperor and rule
over the whole world.”
<div n="NI"/>Yādavī yielded to the sage's advice and did not court
death, and soon afterwards she delivered a son, and he
was named Sagara, which meant “he who was affected
by poison even while he was in the mother's womb. It
was this child who, in later years, became reputed as
emperor Sagara.
<div n="NI"/>Sagara married the elder sister of Garuḍa when he was
living as a boy in Aurva's āśrama, and there is a story
behind the marriage, a story which related to the time
when Garuḍa was not born.
[Page283-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Vinatā, mother of Garuḍa, while she was working as the
slave of Kadrū, one day went into the woods to collect
firewood for her mistress. In the terrible rain and
storm that ensued, Vinatā lost her track and wandered
in the forest for many days before she could take shelter
in the āśrama of a Sannyāsin. The pious man felt sorry
for poor Vinatā and blessed her that a son, who would
be able to win freedom for her would be born to her.
Garuḍa was the son thus born to her.
<div n="NI"/>Before the birth of Garuḍa when Kaśyapa and Vinatā
were living together with their daughter Sumati the boy
sage Upamanyu, son of Sutapas, went to them and told
Kaśyapa thus: “While touring round the earth I wor-
shipped the pitṛs at Gayā and I have been told that they
(Pitṛs) would get redemption only in case I married and
became a father. I, therefore, request you to please give
your daughter Sumati to me as wife. Vinatā did not
relish this proposal. Upamanyu got angry at the re-
jection of his offer and cursed Vinatā saying that if
Sumati was given in marriage to any other brahmin boy
she (Vinatā) would die with her head broken into
pieces.
<div n="NI"/>It was during this period when Vinatā was in a fix
about the marriage of Sumati that Garuḍa was born to
her. He also thought over the problem and argued like
this: the curse is only against a brahmin boy marrying
my sister Sumati; why not Sumati be given in marriage
to a Kṣatriya; but where to find an eligible Kṣatriya
boy? At this stage Vinatā asked him to go and meet the
Sannyāsin, who had promised her an illustrious son, in
the forest and this Sannyāsin directed Garuḍa to Aurva,
for advice and guidance. When Garuḍa met Aurva and
sought his advice about the marriage of his sister, the
sage thought that the context offered a very good bride
to Sagara. And, according to Aurva's advice Sumati
was married to Sagara, and thus Garuḍa became re-
lated to the Kings of the Solar dynasty. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapters 16, 17 and 18). The Sixty thousand
sons born to Sagara by Sumati were reduced to ashes in
the fire which emanated from the eyes of Kapila. (See
Kapila). When Aṃśumān, the grandson of Sagara was
going around the world to find out these 60,000 sons he
met Garuḍa on the way, and it was he who advised that
the waters of Gaṅgā should be brought down on earth
so that the dead sons of Sagara might get spiritual
redemption. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Chap-
ter 41).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Garuḍa's conceit laid low.%} A very beautiful daughter,
Guṇakeśī, was born to Mātali, the charioteer of Indra.
In the course of his search for a suitable husband for
Guṇakeśī he came to Pātālaloka in the company of
Nārada, and there Mātali selected a noble nāga called
Sumukha as his prospective son-in-law. But a month
before Garuḍa had eaten Sumukha's father Cikara, and
he had also given notice to Sumukha that within a
month's time he too would be eaten.
<div n="NI"/>Nārada and Mātali met Sumukha at the abode of his
grandfather Āryaka, who was very glad to marry his
grandson to Mātali's daughter. But, the threat of
Garuḍa that he would eat Sumukha before the month
was over stared them all cruelly in their face. So, they
appealed to Indra for a solution to the problem, in the
presence of Mahāviṣṇu. Indra gave an extension of life
to Sumukha and he wedded Guṇakeśī. The marriage
enraged Garuḍa so much that he went to Indra's
[Page284-a+ 64]
assembly and insulted both Indra and Viṣṇu at which
Viṣṇu extended his right hand to Garuḍa asking him
whether he could hold the hand. And, when Garuḍa
placed Viṣṇu's hand on his head he felt as if the whole
weight of the three worlds was put on the head. Garuḍa
admitted his defeat. Mahāviṣṇu thus laid low the
conceit of Garuḍa. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 105).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Garuḍa helped Gālava.%} Gālava was a disciple of
Viśvāmitra. Once Dharmadeva, to test Viśvāmitra, went
to his āśrama disguised as Vasiṣṭha and asked for food.
As there was no ready-made food at the āśrama just
then, Viśvāmitra naturally took some time to cook new
food, and he went with it, steaming hot, in a plate to
the guest. Saying that he would return within minutes
and receive the food, the guest (Dharmadeva) left the
place, and Viśvāmitra stood there with the plate in
hand awaiting the return of the guest. He had to
remain standing thus for one hundred years, and during
this whole period it was Gālava who stood there looking
after his guru. When hundred years were completed
Dharmadeva returned to Viśvāmitra and accepted his
hospitality, and then only could the latter take some
rest.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra blessed Gālava, and now it was time for him
to leave the āśrama. Though Viśvāmitra told that no
gurudakṣiṇā (tuition fee) was required Gālava persist-
ed in asking him what fee or present he wanted.
Viśvāmitra lost his temper and told Gālava that if he
was so very particular about gurudakṣiṇā, eight hun-
dred horses all having the colour of moon, and one ear
black in colour might be given as dakṣiṇā. Gālava
stood there aghast at the above pronouncement of his
preceptor, when Garuḍa happened to go over there and
hear from Gālava about his sad plight. Money was re-
quired to purchase horses, but Gālava was penniless.
At any rate Garuḍa with Gālava on his back flew east-
wards and reached Ṛṣabhaparvata and they rested on
a peak of it. There the Brahmā woman, Śāṇḍilī was
engaged in tapas and she served them with food. After
food Garuḍa spoke disparagingly about Śāṇḍilī. Garuḍa
and Gālava slept that night on the floor, but when they
woke up in the morning lo! Garuḍa was completely
shed of his feathers. Garuḍa stood before Śāṇḍilī, his
head bent in anguish. Śāṇḍilī blessed Garuḍa, who
then got back his old feathers.
<div n="NI"/>Continuing their journey Garuḍa and Gālava reached
the palace of the very rich King, Yayāti. Garuḍa intro-
duced Gālava to Yayāti, who found it difficult to get
800 horses for Gālava. But, Yayāti gave his daughter
Mādhavī to Gālava saying that he might give her to
any King and get money enough to purchase 800
horses. After thus showing the means to get money to
Gālava, Garuḍa returned home.
<div n="NI"/>Gālava gave Mādhavī first to King Haryaśva of
Ayodhyā, then to King Divodāsa of Kāśī and next to
King Uśīnara of Bhoja and got from them two hundred
horses each, and he submitted the horses and also
Mādhavī in lieu of the balance of two hundred horses
to Viśvāmitra as dakṣiṇā. A son called Aṣṭaka was born
to Viśvāmitra by Mādhavī, who had been granted a
boon that she would not lose her youth and beauty even
though she lived with any number of people. (Udyoga-
Parva Chapter 108).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Fight between Garuḍa and Airāvata.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa once
[Page284-b+ 64]
went to Devaloka and plucked the Pārijāta flower from
the garden Nandana, and this led to a fight between
Indra and Kṛṣṇa in which Garuḍa also joined. Garuḍa
directed his main attention on Airāvata which, at his
blows, fainted and fell down. (Harivaṃśa, Chapter 73).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Defeated by Vāsuki.%} To churn the Milk-Ocean the
Devas and Asuras decided to use Mount Mandara as
the shaft and Vāsuki as the rope to rotate the shaft.
The attempts of the Devas, the Asuras and the Bhūtaga-
ṇas of Śiva failed to uproot and bring with them the
mountain, when Garuḍa, at the instance of Viṣṇu
brought the mountain as easily as a kite carries a frog.
Again, when others failed to bring Vāsuki from nāga-
loka Garuḍa went and asked the nāga chief to follow
him to the ocean of Milk. Vāsuki replied that if his
presence was so indispensable he must be carried over
there. Then Garuḍa caught the middle part of Vāsuki
in his beak and rose in the air. But, even though
Garuḍa rose beyond the horizon, when he looked down
half of Vāsuki still remained on the ground. Garuḍa
then tried to fold Vāsuki into two and carry it, but,
again to no purpose. Disappointed and humiliated
Garuḍa returned without Vāsuki. Afterwards Vāsuki
was brought to the ocean of Milk by Śiva's hand stret-
ched down into Pātāla. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Bhīma went in search of the Saugandhika flower on%}
{%account of Garuḍa.%} While, in the course of their exile in
the forest, the Pāṇḍavas were put up at the āśrama of
maharṣi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, Garuḍa picked up from the depths
of the sea one day a nāga called Ṛddhimān, and due to
the vibration caused by the lashing of Garuḍa's wings
Kalhāra flowers from the garden of Kubera were flown
to the feet of Pāñcālī. She wore the fragrant flowers in
her hair saying that if she were to have good flowers,
wind had to bring them. Since there was a mild and
veiled insinuation in that statement that Bhīma was
inferior to the wind the former did not appreciate that
comment by Pāñcālī. And so he rushed to Mount
Gandhamādana to collect Kalhāra flowers. (Vana
Parva, Chapter 106).
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Garuḍa saved Uparicaravasu.%} Once a controversy
started between the Devas and the brahmins, the former
advocating the use of goat's flesh in performing yajñas
while the brahmins contended that grains were sufficient
for the purpose. Uparicaravasu, who arbitrated in the
debate spoke in favour of the Devas, which the brahmins
did not like, and they cursed Vasu to fall from the sky
into the pits of the earth. This curse was countered
by the Devas blessing him that as long as Uparicara-
vasu remained on earth he would not feel hungry and
that he would regain his old form due to the blessings
of Mahāviṣṇu. Vasu prayed to Viṣṇu, who sent Garuḍa
to the former, and Garuḍa carried Vasu to the sky on
his wings. Thus Vasu became again Uparicaravasu.
