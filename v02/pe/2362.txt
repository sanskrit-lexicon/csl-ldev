GARUḌA¦. King of birds.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>-Marīci—Kaśyapa—Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of
<div n="lb"/>Marīci married the eight daughters of Dakṣa called
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu
<div n="lb"/>and Analā. And to Tāmrā five daughters were born,
<div n="lb"/>viz. Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī. Out
<div n="lb"/>of the five women Krauñcī became mother of the owls,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāsī delivered the bhāsas (types of birds) and from
<div n="lb"/>Śyenī were born vultures and kites. Haṃsa, Kalahaṃsa,
<div n="lb"/>Koka etc. are children of Dhṛtarāṣṭrī. From Śukī was
<div n="lb"/>born Nalā and from Nalā, Vinatā; Aruṇa and Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>were the two sons born to Vinatā. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 15).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in the Mahābhārata about the birth of
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa and Garuḍa. Kaśyapa who was much pleased
<div n="lb"/>with the service of Vinatā and Kadrū asked them to
<div n="lb"/>select any boon they desired. Kadrū chose to have a
<div n="lb"/>thousand nāgas as her children while Vinatā chose to
<div n="lb"/>have two sons more powerful and heroic than the thou-
<div n="lb"/>sand sons of Kadrū. After granting them the boon
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa retreated into the forest.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Kadrū laid thousand eggs and Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>two eggs. Both of them kept their eggs in hot pots. In
<div n="lb"/>the 500th year the eggs of Kadrū hatched and thousand
<div n="lb"/>serpents of various kinds emerged out of them. But
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā's eggs did not hatch yet, and the sight of Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>playing with her children pained Vinatā much. She,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, broke open one of her eggs in secret, and a
<div n="lb"/>half-grown child stepped out of it. That child was
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa. Aruṇa got angry that Vinatā forced open the
<div n="lb"/>egg prematurely. He told her that as punishment there-
<div n="lb"/>of she would become a slave of Kadrū. But, Aruṇa
<div n="lb"/>granted her redemption from the curse thus: After an-
<div n="lb"/>other 500 years the remaining egg of yours will hatch
<div n="lb"/>and a son endowed with exceptional power and pro-
<div n="lb"/>wess will be born to you. He will liberate you from
<div n="lb"/>slavery.” After telling his mother so much Aruṇa rose
<div n="lb"/>to the sky where he became the charioteer of the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 16. See also Para 6 infra).
<div n="NI"/>After 500 years the egg broke itself open and out came
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa with blazing effulgence, and he rose up in the
<div n="lb"/>sky. His body glowed like the sun. The Devas who got
<div n="lb"/>themselves dimmed by his effulgence asked Agnideva
<div n="lb"/>the reason therefor. Agnideva told them about the
<div n="lb"/>birth of Garuḍa and also that he was equally effulgent
<div n="lb"/>as himself (Agnideva). Then all of them went to
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa and lavished on his head all possible blessings,
<div n="lb"/>and Garuḍa, as requested by them, controlled his efful-
<div n="lb"/>gence and returned to his mother. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 23).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Slavery of Vinatā:%} The churning of the Milk-ocean
<div n="lb"/>was done before Garuḍa was born. Indra got a horse
<div n="lb"/>named Uccaiḥśravas from the Ocean of Milk. Between
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū and Vinatā a dispute arose as regards the colour
<div n="lb"/>of the horse's tail, Kadrū saying that it was black while
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā asserted that it was white. They further agreed
<div n="lb"/>to test the colour the next day, betting that she who
<div n="lb"/>was proved to be wrong would become the slave of the
<div n="lb"/>victor. As the nāga sons of Kadrū hung on to the tail
[Page281-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>of the horse the tail appeared to be black and Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>lost the bet and became Kadrū's slave.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this juncture that Garuḍa was born, and he
<div n="lb"/>felt highly mortified to find his mother working as a
<div n="lb"/>slave of Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>Kadrū and her nāga sons once ordered Vinatā to carry
<div n="lb"/>them to the nāga residence in the middle of the ocean,
<div n="lb"/>called Rāmaṇīyaka (Ramaṇam). Accordingly Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>carrying Kadrū on her shoulders and Garuḍa carrying
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū's sons on his shoulders rose up in the sky. But,
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa did not relish the slavish work, and he, carry-
<div n="lb"/>ing with him the nāgas, flew up to the sun's orbit. The
<div n="lb"/>nāga children fainted due to the excessive heat. But, on
<div n="lb"/>the request of Kadrū Indra sent heavy rain and the
<div n="lb"/>nāgas regained consciousness. By then they had reached
<div n="lb"/>Rāmaṇīyaka island.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Attempt at freeing Vinatā from thraldom.%} Garuḍa, ex-
<div n="lb"/>tremely pained at the pitiable plight of his mother, one
<div n="lb"/>day asked Kadrū what price she and her children
<div n="lb"/>demanded for freeing Vinatā from slavery, and Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>demanded Amṛta from Devaloka as the price.
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa decided to get it and informed his mother
<div n="lb"/>about his decision to fly to Devaloka. But, what about
<div n="lb"/>food till he reached Devaloka? Vinatā solved the pro-
<div n="lb"/>blem by advising Garuḍa to eat the niṣādas he will
<div n="lb"/>meet on his way to Devaloka at the island called
<div n="lb"/>Niṣādālaya, at the same time specially forbidding him
<div n="lb"/>from eating on any account, brahmins who might be
<div n="lb"/>there, at Niṣādālaya. How to distinguish brahmins
<div n="lb"/>from others, queried Garuḍa, and his mother replied
<div n="lb"/>by pointing out that the brahmin will burn the throat
<div n="lb"/>of him who tries to eat him, like fire. Then Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>blessed her son that his wings would be protected by
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu, the lower half of his body by sun and moon, the
<div n="lb"/>rest of the body by the Vasus and the head by Agni.
<div n="lb"/>She also promised to wait there till her son returned.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Garuḍa to Devaloka.%} After saluting his mother
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa set out on his quest for Amṛta. All the fourteen
<div n="lb"/>worlds shook at the lashing of his wings. He reached
<div n="lb"/>Niṣādālaya, where while consuming whole lots of Niṣā-
<div n="lb"/>das a brahmin and his wife also happened to get into
<div n="lb"/>his throat. Garuḍa felt their presence immediately in
<div n="lb"/>his throat and requested them to get out of his mouth.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly they got out and also blessed Garuḍa, who
<div n="lb"/>continued on his journey.
<div n="NI"/>Next Garuḍa reached the forest where his father
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa was engaged in tapas. He told him about his
<div n="lb"/>mission and requested him for something to eat.
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa replied thus:—“You see a pool wherein an
<div n="lb"/>elephant and a tortoise are living for long as enemies.
<div n="lb"/>Long ago two brothers Vibhāvasu and Supratīka quar-
<div n="lb"/>relled over their paternal wealth and at the height of
<div n="lb"/>it Vibhāvasu cursed Supratīka to become an elephant
<div n="lb"/>when Supratīka pronounced the counter curse that
<div n="lb"/>Vibhāvasu should turn out to be a tortoise. You, my
<div n="lb"/>son Garuḍa may eat that elephant and tortoise. May
<div n="lb"/>your journey for Amṛta be crowned with success.
<div n="NI"/>Now, Garuḍa after saluting his father, flew up in the
<div n="lb"/>sky carrying in his beak the elephant and the tortoise
<div n="lb"/>from the pool. As trees were falling uprooted due to
<div n="lb"/>the terrific vibrations caused by the lashing of his wings
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa did not find a convenient place to sit down to
<div n="lb"/>eat his food. While continuing the journey Garuḍa saw
<div n="lb"/>a big tree, its branches spread out in a circumference
[Page282-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of a hundred yojanas. But, as soon as Garuḍa set foot on
<div n="lb"/>a branch of the tree it (branch) crumbled down. On
<div n="lb"/>that broken branch were the sages called Bālakhilyas
<div n="lb"/>doing tapas hanging their heads down. Fearing that the
<div n="lb"/>sages might fall down Garuḍa continued his flight
<div n="lb"/>holding in his beak the torn branch of the tree. But he
<div n="lb"/>could not find a safe place to deposit the branch with
<div n="lb"/>the sages. So he came again to Mount Gandhamādana
<div n="lb"/>and saw Kaśyapa, who apologised to the Bālakhilyas
<div n="lb"/>on behalf of his son and also explained to them about
<div n="lb"/>his mission. The Bālakhilyas were pleased and they left
<div n="lb"/>the place for the Himālayas. As advised by Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa deposited the branch of the tree on an unin-
<div n="lb"/>habited mountain peak. Garuḍa ate the elephant and
<div n="lb"/>the tortoise there, and therefrom flew to Devaloka (Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 29, 30).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Bālakhilyas cursed Indra.%} Even before the arrival of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa ill omens began appearing in Devaloka. Indra
<div n="lb"/>asked Bṛhaspati for explanation about the ill omens.
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati with his divine eyes saw Garuḍa approach-
<div n="lb"/>ing Devaloka for Amṛta, and he told Indra about
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa born out of the powers of the tapas of Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>and the Bālakhilyas. He also told that such a fate as
<div n="lb"/>the present one befell Indra due to a curse of the
<div n="lb"/>Bālakhilyas. Indra and the other Devas stood guard
<div n="lb"/>over the pot of Amṛta ready to repel all possible
<div n="lb"/>attacks.
<div n="NI"/>There was a reason for Garuḍa's birth from the powers
<div n="lb"/>of the tapas of the Bālakhilyas, and also for Indra to
<div n="lb"/>be put into the present predicament due to the curse
<div n="lb"/>of the Bālakhilyas. Kaśyapaprajāpati, a long time ago,
<div n="lb"/>began a terrific yajña for a son, and Indra and the
<div n="lb"/>Bālakhilyas who numbered more than 60,000 were
<div n="lb"/>deputed by Kaśyapa to collect firewood for the yajña.
<div n="lb"/>The Bālakhilyas were only of the size of a thumb, and
<div n="lb"/>Indra who very easily collected all the firewood needed
<div n="lb"/>for the yajña laughed at the tiny Bālakhilyas who were
<div n="lb"/>carrying small twigs etc. for firewood. Angered at the
<div n="lb"/>insult the Bālakhilyas removed themselves to another
<div n="lb"/>place nearby and began a yajña directed against Indra
<div n="lb"/>who alarmed at it sought the help of Kaśyapa who then
<div n="lb"/>held peace talks with the Bālakhilyas. They transferred
<div n="lb"/>their yāgaśakti (yājñic powers) also to Kaśyapa and
<div n="lb"/>agreed to be satisfied with the condition that as the
<div n="lb"/>result of Kaśyapa's yajña a son should be born to him,
<div n="lb"/>who (the son) would defeat Indra. Thus, for the time
<div n="lb"/>being Indra escaped from the wrath of the Bālakhilyas.
<div n="lb"/>After the yajña was over Vinatā came to Kaśyapa and
<div n="lb"/>he blessed her with a son wishing that he should be-
<div n="lb"/>come exceptionally strong and powerful, and that was
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Amṛtakalaśāpaharaṇam. (The pot of nectar carried%}
<div n="lb"/>{%away).%} Garuḍa approached the pot of nectar, and
<div n="lb"/>Viśvakarmā who attacked him first was felled to the
<div n="lb"/>ground. The dust storm raised by the waving of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa's wings blinded everybody. The Devas and
<div n="lb"/>Indra, nay, even the sun and the Moon lined up
<div n="lb"/>against Garuḍa, but he defeated them all, and entered
<div n="lb"/>the particular place where the pot of nectar was kept.
<div n="lb"/>Two terrific wheels were rotating round the pot and
<div n="lb"/>they would cut into mince-meat anybody who tried to
<div n="lb"/>lay hands on the pot and a machine circled the wheels.
<div n="lb"/>Below the wheels were two monstrous serpents with
<div n="lb"/>glowing eyes and protruding tongues like flashes of
<div n="lb"/>fire, and the serpents never closed their eyes. The very
[Page282-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>look with those eyes was enough to poison anyone to
<div n="lb"/>death. Garuḍa blinded those eyes by raising a torrent
<div n="lb"/>of dust, pierced them in the middle with his beak and
<div n="lb"/>and through the hole, his body reduced to such a tiny
<div n="lb"/>shape, went nearer to the pot. He destroyed the
<div n="lb"/>wheels and the machine, and carrying the pot of nectar
<div n="lb"/>in his beaks rose to the sky shielding the light of the
<div n="lb"/>sun by his outspread wings. Mahāviṣṇu, who became so
<div n="lb"/>much pleased with the tremendous achievements of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa asked him to choose any boon. Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>requested Viṣṇu that he should be made his (Viṣṇu's)
<div n="lb"/>vehicle and rendered immortal without his tasting
<div n="lb"/>amṛta. Both the boons were granted.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Garuḍa and Indra became friends.%} Indra hit with the
<div n="lb"/>Vajra (his special weapon) the wings of Garuḍa who
<div n="lb"/>was returning from Viṣṇu. It did not wound his body,
<div n="lb"/>but a feather of his fell in the atmosphere. Everybody
<div n="lb"/>who saw the feather acclaimed Garuḍa as Suparṇa (he
<div n="lb"/>with the good wings). Indra was wonder-struck, and
<div n="lb"/>he approached Garuḍa and requested that they should
<div n="lb"/>be friends in future and the pot of nectar be returned.
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa replied that the nectar would be returned if
<div n="lb"/>he was granted the power to make nāgas his food, and
<div n="lb"/>Indra blessed him that he would live by consuming
<div n="lb"/>nāgas. And then Garuḍa told Indra thus: “I took this
<div n="lb"/>pot of amṛta not for my own use. The nāgas cheated
<div n="lb"/>my mother and made her a slave, and she will be freed
<div n="lb"/>if only this pot of nectar is given to them (nāgas). You
<div n="lb"/>may snatch off the pot from the nāgas; I shall not
<div n="lb"/>object to it.”
<div n="NI"/>Indra and Garuḍa thus became friends and the former
<div n="lb"/>followed Garuḍa on his way back home.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Garuḍa handed over the pot of amṛta to the nāgas and%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Indra cheated them of it.%} Garuḍa handed over the pot of
<div n="lb"/>nectar to the nāgas, who on the suggestion of the
<div n="lb"/>former placed the pot on darbha grass spread on the
<div n="lb"/>ground. Also, in accordance with Garuḍa's advice that
<div n="lb"/>they should take a purificatory bath before tasting the
<div n="lb"/>amṛta the nāgas went out to have the bath, and in
<div n="lb"/>their absence Indra carried off the pot of nectar back
<div n="lb"/>to Devaloka. Failing to find the pot of nectar on their
<div n="lb"/>return from bath the aggrieved nāgas licked the darbha
<div n="lb"/>on which the pot was placed with the result that their
<div n="lb"/>tongues were cloven into two. It was from that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards that the nāgas became double-tongued
<div n="lb"/>(dvijihvas). And, thus Garuḍa redeemed his mother
<div n="lb"/>from slavery. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 34).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The fig tree which Garuḍa broke with his beaks and%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Laṅkā.%} It has been noted above that Garuḍa on his
<div n="lb"/>way to Devaloka rested on a fig tree. That fig is
<div n="lb"/>called Subhadra in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa saw the fig tree around which sages were sitting
<div n="lb"/>and which bore marks made by Garuḍa sitting thereon.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 35, Verse
<div n="lb"/>26).
<div n="NI"/>There is some connection between this tree and Laṅkā.
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa had, as directed by Kaśyapa, deposited in the
<div n="lb"/>sea the branch of the tree on which the Bālakhilyas
<div n="lb"/>hung in tapas and with which Garuḍa flew hither and
<div n="lb"/>thither fearing about the safety of the Bālakhilyas. At
<div n="lb"/>the spot in the sea where the branch was deposited
<div n="lb"/>sprang up an island like the peak of a mountain. It
<div n="lb"/>was this island which in after years became reputed as
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāmukhalaṃbaka,
<div n="lb"/>Taraṅga 4).
[Page283-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Garuḍa, Saubhari and Kāliya.%} Garuḍa had always
<div n="lb"/>entertained great hatred against the nāgas, and now
<div n="lb"/>Indra's permission having been obtained by him to eat
<div n="lb"/>the nāgas for food, Garuḍa decided to launch a regular
<div n="lb"/>nāga-hunting expedition. He began eating the nāgas
<div n="lb"/>one by one. Alarmed at this the nāgas planned for their
<div n="lb"/>security in a conclave, and approached Garuḍa with
<div n="lb"/>the proposal that one nāga would go to him daily
<div n="lb"/>to serve as his food instead of his indiscriminate killing
<div n="lb"/>of them. Garuḍa accepted their proposal. After some
<div n="lb"/>time the nāgas proposed to Garuḍa that they would
<div n="lb"/>conduct a sarpa-bali (sacrifice of serpents) and submit
<div n="lb"/>the food got out of the bali to him so that his nāga-
<div n="lb"/>hunting might be stopped for ever. Garuḍa agreed to
<div n="lb"/>this also. According to the new agreement daily one
<div n="lb"/>nāga began going to Garuḍa with the food got
<div n="lb"/>out of the bali.
<div n="NI"/>But Kāliya alone did not agree to the programme as he
<div n="lb"/>did not recognise Garuḍa to be superior to him in
<div n="lb"/>power. And, Garuḍa, who wanted to teach the haughty
<div n="lb"/>Kāliya a lesson challenged him to fight, and the fight
<div n="lb"/>took place in river Kālindī, Kāliya's abode. During
<div n="lb"/>the fight the lashing of Garuḍa's wings raised the
<div n="lb"/>water in Kālindī up in the sky and it drenched the
<div n="lb"/>sage Saubhari all over, who was performing tapas on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of Kālindī. Saubhari cursed that the body
<div n="lb"/>of Garuḍa be shattered into a thousand pieces if ever
<div n="lb"/>he entered that area in future, and thenceforth the
<div n="lb"/>place became a prohibited area for Garuḍa. During
<div n="lb"/>after years Kāliya was put up at this place.
<div n="NI"/>A kadamba tree alone outlived the effect of the poison
<div n="lb"/>of Kāliya. The tree could outlive the deadly poison
<div n="lb"/>because Garuḍa had rested on it on his way back from
<div n="lb"/>Devaloka with amṛta. (Bhāgavata daśama Śkandha).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Relationship of Garuḍa with the kings of the solar%}
<div n="lb"/>{%dynasty.%} King Sagara of the solar dynasty was married
<div n="lb"/>to Sumati, the elder sister of Garuḍa, and there is a
<div n="lb"/>story behind the marriage.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a king called Subāhu in the solar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty. He married one Yādavī, but for many years
<div n="lb"/>they had no issues. Yādavī had become old by the
<div n="lb"/>time she conceived a child as the result of many
<div n="lb"/>yajñas etc. But, Subāhu's other wives, viz. co-wives
<div n="lb"/>of Yādavī, did not like the prospects of Yādavī
<div n="lb"/>becoming a mother. They administered poison to her
<div n="lb"/>with the result that Yādavī did not deliver in time,
<div n="lb"/>but continued as a pregnant woman for seven years.
<div n="lb"/>The sad couple, for their mental relief went into the
<div n="lb"/>forest and lived as disciples of a sage called Aurva. But
<div n="lb"/>Subāhu died rather soon and Yādavī prepared
<div n="lb"/>herself to follow him in the funeral pyre. But, the
<div n="lb"/>sage Aurva prevented her from self immolation speak-
<div n="lb"/>ing to her thus: “You shall not act rashly. The child
<div n="lb"/>in your womb will become a famous emperor and rule
<div n="lb"/>over the whole world.”
<div n="NI"/>Yādavī yielded to the sage's advice and did not court
<div n="lb"/>death, and soon afterwards she delivered a son, and he
<div n="lb"/>was named Sagara, which meant “he who was affected
<div n="lb"/>by poison even while he was in the mother's womb. It
<div n="lb"/>was this child who, in later years, became reputed as
<div n="lb"/>emperor Sagara.
<div n="NI"/>Sagara married the elder sister of Garuḍa when he was
<div n="lb"/>living as a boy in Aurva's āśrama, and there is a story
<div n="lb"/>behind the marriage, a story which related to the time
<div n="lb"/>when Garuḍa was not born.
[Page283-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Vinatā, mother of Garuḍa, while she was working as the
<div n="lb"/>slave of Kadrū, one day went into the woods to collect
<div n="lb"/>firewood for her mistress. In the terrible rain and
<div n="lb"/>storm that ensued, Vinatā lost her track and wandered
<div n="lb"/>in the forest for many days before she could take shelter
<div n="lb"/>in the āśrama of a Sannyāsin. The pious man felt sorry
<div n="lb"/>for poor Vinatā and blessed her that a son, who would
<div n="lb"/>be able to win freedom for her would be born to her.
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa was the son thus born to her.
<div n="NI"/>Before the birth of Garuḍa when Kaśyapa and Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>were living together with their daughter Sumati the boy
<div n="lb"/>sage Upamanyu, son of Sutapas, went to them and told
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa thus: “While touring round the earth I wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped the pitṛs at Gayā and I have been told that they
<div n="lb"/>(Pitṛs) would get redemption only in case I married and
<div n="lb"/>became a father. I, therefore, request you to please give
<div n="lb"/>your daughter Sumati to me as wife. Vinatā did not
<div n="lb"/>relish this proposal. Upamanyu got angry at the re-
<div n="lb"/>jection of his offer and cursed Vinatā saying that if
<div n="lb"/>Sumati was given in marriage to any other brahmin boy
<div n="lb"/>she (Vinatā) would die with her head broken into
<div n="lb"/>pieces.
<div n="NI"/>It was during this period when Vinatā was in a fix
<div n="lb"/>about the marriage of Sumati that Garuḍa was born to
<div n="lb"/>her. He also thought over the problem and argued like
<div n="lb"/>this: the curse is only against a brahmin boy marrying
<div n="lb"/>my sister Sumati; why not Sumati be given in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to a Kṣatriya; but where to find an eligible Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>boy? At this stage Vinatā asked him to go and meet the
<div n="lb"/>Sannyāsin, who had promised her an illustrious son, in
<div n="lb"/>the forest and this Sannyāsin directed Garuḍa to Aurva,
<div n="lb"/>for advice and guidance. When Garuḍa met Aurva and
<div n="lb"/>sought his advice about the marriage of his sister, the
<div n="lb"/>sage thought that the context offered a very good bride
<div n="lb"/>to Sagara. And, according to Aurva's advice Sumati
<div n="lb"/>was married to Sagara, and thus Garuḍa became re-
<div n="lb"/>lated to the Kings of the Solar dynasty. (Brahmāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapters 16, 17 and 18). The Sixty thousand
<div n="lb"/>sons born to Sagara by Sumati were reduced to ashes in
<div n="lb"/>the fire which emanated from the eyes of Kapila. (See
<div n="lb"/>Kapila). When Aṃśumān, the grandson of Sagara was
<div n="lb"/>going around the world to find out these 60,000 sons he
<div n="lb"/>met Garuḍa on the way, and it was he who advised that
<div n="lb"/>the waters of Gaṅgā should be brought down on earth
<div n="lb"/>so that the dead sons of Sagara might get spiritual
<div n="lb"/>redemption. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 41).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Garuḍa's conceit laid low.%} A very beautiful daughter,
<div n="lb"/>Guṇakeśī, was born to Mātali, the charioteer of Indra.
<div n="lb"/>In the course of his search for a suitable husband for
<div n="lb"/>Guṇakeśī he came to Pātālaloka in the company of
<div n="lb"/>Nārada, and there Mātali selected a noble nāga called
<div n="lb"/>Sumukha as his prospective son-in-law. But a month
<div n="lb"/>before Garuḍa had eaten Sumukha's father Cikara, and
<div n="lb"/>he had also given notice to Sumukha that within a
<div n="lb"/>month's time he too would be eaten.
<div n="NI"/>Nārada and Mātali met Sumukha at the abode of his
<div n="lb"/>grandfather Āryaka, who was very glad to marry his
<div n="lb"/>grandson to Mātali's daughter. But, the threat of
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa that he would eat Sumukha before the month
<div n="lb"/>was over stared them all cruelly in their face. So, they
<div n="lb"/>appealed to Indra for a solution to the problem, in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of Mahāviṣṇu. Indra gave an extension of life
<div n="lb"/>to Sumukha and he wedded Guṇakeśī. The marriage
<div n="lb"/>enraged Garuḍa so much that he went to Indra's
[Page284-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>assembly and insulted both Indra and Viṣṇu at which
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu extended his right hand to Garuḍa asking him
<div n="lb"/>whether he could hold the hand. And, when Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>placed Viṣṇu's hand on his head he felt as if the whole
<div n="lb"/>weight of the three worlds was put on the head. Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>admitted his defeat. Mahāviṣṇu thus laid low the
<div n="lb"/>conceit of Garuḍa. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 105).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Garuḍa helped Gālava.%} Gālava was a disciple of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra. Once Dharmadeva, to test Viśvāmitra, went
<div n="lb"/>to his āśrama disguised as Vasiṣṭha and asked for food.
<div n="lb"/>As there was no ready-made food at the āśrama just
<div n="lb"/>then, Viśvāmitra naturally took some time to cook new
<div n="lb"/>food, and he went with it, steaming hot, in a plate to
<div n="lb"/>the guest. Saying that he would return within minutes
<div n="lb"/>and receive the food, the guest (Dharmadeva) left the
<div n="lb"/>place, and Viśvāmitra stood there with the plate in
<div n="lb"/>hand awaiting the return of the guest. He had to
<div n="lb"/>remain standing thus for one hundred years, and during
<div n="lb"/>this whole period it was Gālava who stood there looking
<div n="lb"/>after his guru. When hundred years were completed
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadeva returned to Viśvāmitra and accepted his
<div n="lb"/>hospitality, and then only could the latter take some
<div n="lb"/>rest.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra blessed Gālava, and now it was time for him
<div n="lb"/>to leave the āśrama. Though Viśvāmitra told that no
<div n="lb"/>gurudakṣiṇā (tuition fee) was required Gālava persist-
<div n="lb"/>ed in asking him what fee or present he wanted.
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra lost his temper and told Gālava that if he
<div n="lb"/>was so very particular about gurudakṣiṇā, eight hun-
<div n="lb"/>dred horses all having the colour of moon, and one ear
<div n="lb"/>black in colour might be given as dakṣiṇā. Gālava
<div n="lb"/>stood there aghast at the above pronouncement of his
<div n="lb"/>preceptor, when Garuḍa happened to go over there and
<div n="lb"/>hear from Gālava about his sad plight. Money was re-
<div n="lb"/>quired to purchase horses, but Gālava was penniless.
<div n="lb"/>At any rate Garuḍa with Gālava on his back flew east-
<div n="lb"/>wards and reached Ṛṣabhaparvata and they rested on
<div n="lb"/>a peak of it. There the Brahmā woman, Śāṇḍilī was
<div n="lb"/>engaged in tapas and she served them with food. After
<div n="lb"/>food Garuḍa spoke disparagingly about Śāṇḍilī. Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Gālava slept that night on the floor, but when they
<div n="lb"/>woke up in the morning lo! Garuḍa was completely
<div n="lb"/>shed of his feathers. Garuḍa stood before Śāṇḍilī, his
<div n="lb"/>head bent in anguish. Śāṇḍilī blessed Garuḍa, who
<div n="lb"/>then got back his old feathers.
<div n="NI"/>Continuing their journey Garuḍa and Gālava reached
<div n="lb"/>the palace of the very rich King, Yayāti. Garuḍa intro-
<div n="lb"/>duced Gālava to Yayāti, who found it difficult to get
<div n="lb"/>800 horses for Gālava. But, Yayāti gave his daughter
<div n="lb"/>Mādhavī to Gālava saying that he might give her to
<div n="lb"/>any King and get money enough to purchase 800
<div n="lb"/>horses. After thus showing the means to get money to
<div n="lb"/>Gālava, Garuḍa returned home.
<div n="NI"/>Gālava gave Mādhavī first to King Haryaśva of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā, then to King Divodāsa of Kāśī and next to
<div n="lb"/>King Uśīnara of Bhoja and got from them two hundred
<div n="lb"/>horses each, and he submitted the horses and also
<div n="lb"/>Mādhavī in lieu of the balance of two hundred horses
<div n="lb"/>to Viśvāmitra as dakṣiṇā. A son called Aṣṭaka was born
<div n="lb"/>to Viśvāmitra by Mādhavī, who had been granted a
<div n="lb"/>boon that she would not lose her youth and beauty even
<div n="lb"/>though she lived with any number of people. (Udyoga-
<div n="lb"/>Parva Chapter 108).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Fight between Garuḍa and Airāvata.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa once
[Page284-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>went to Devaloka and plucked the Pārijāta flower from
<div n="lb"/>the garden Nandana, and this led to a fight between
<div n="lb"/>Indra and Kṛṣṇa in which Garuḍa also joined. Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>directed his main attention on Airāvata which, at his
<div n="lb"/>blows, fainted and fell down. (Harivaṃśa, Chapter 73).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Defeated by Vāsuki.%} To churn the Milk-Ocean the
<div n="lb"/>Devas and Asuras decided to use Mount Mandara as
<div n="lb"/>the shaft and Vāsuki as the rope to rotate the shaft.
<div n="lb"/>The attempts of the Devas, the Asuras and the Bhūtaga-
<div n="lb"/>ṇas of Śiva failed to uproot and bring with them the
<div n="lb"/>mountain, when Garuḍa, at the instance of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>brought the mountain as easily as a kite carries a frog.
<div n="lb"/>Again, when others failed to bring Vāsuki from nāga-
<div n="lb"/>loka Garuḍa went and asked the nāga chief to follow
<div n="lb"/>him to the ocean of Milk. Vāsuki replied that if his
<div n="lb"/>presence was so indispensable he must be carried over
<div n="lb"/>there. Then Garuḍa caught the middle part of Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>in his beak and rose in the air. But, even though
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa rose beyond the horizon, when he looked down
<div n="lb"/>half of Vāsuki still remained on the ground. Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>then tried to fold Vāsuki into two and carry it, but,
<div n="lb"/>again to no purpose. Disappointed and humiliated
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa returned without Vāsuki. Afterwards Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>was brought to the ocean of Milk by Śiva's hand stret-
<div n="lb"/>ched down into Pātāla. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Bhīma went in search of the Saugandhika flower on%}
<div n="lb"/>{%account of Garuḍa.%} While, in the course of their exile in
<div n="lb"/>the forest, the Pāṇḍavas were put up at the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>maharṣi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, Garuḍa picked up from the depths
<div n="lb"/>of the sea one day a nāga called Ṛddhimān, and due to
<div n="lb"/>the vibration caused by the lashing of Garuḍa's wings
<div n="lb"/>Kalhāra flowers from the garden of Kubera were flown
<div n="lb"/>to the feet of Pāñcālī. She wore the fragrant flowers in
<div n="lb"/>her hair saying that if she were to have good flowers,
<div n="lb"/>wind had to bring them. Since there was a mild and
<div n="lb"/>veiled insinuation in that statement that Bhīma was
<div n="lb"/>inferior to the wind the former did not appreciate that
<div n="lb"/>comment by Pāñcālī. And so he rushed to Mount
<div n="lb"/>Gandhamādana to collect Kalhāra flowers. (Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 106).
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Garuḍa saved Uparicaravasu.%} Once a controversy
<div n="lb"/>started between the Devas and the brahmins, the former
<div n="lb"/>advocating the use of goat's flesh in performing yajñas
<div n="lb"/>while the brahmins contended that grains were sufficient
<div n="lb"/>for the purpose. Uparicaravasu, who arbitrated in the
<div n="lb"/>debate spoke in favour of the Devas, which the brahmins
<div n="lb"/>did not like, and they cursed Vasu to fall from the sky
<div n="lb"/>into the pits of the earth. This curse was countered
<div n="lb"/>by the Devas blessing him that as long as Uparicara-
<div n="lb"/>vasu remained on earth he would not feel hungry and
<div n="lb"/>that he would regain his old form due to the blessings
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāviṣṇu. Vasu prayed to Viṣṇu, who sent Garuḍa
<div n="lb"/>to the former, and Garuḍa carried Vasu to the sky on
<div n="lb"/>his wings. Thus Vasu became again Uparicaravasu.
<div n="lb"/>(Śānti Parva, Chapter 338).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Other information about Garuḍa.%} (1) A dānava once
<div n="lb"/>stole away the crown of Śṛī Kṛṣṇa who was on a visit
