YAJÑADATTA II¦. A Brāhmaṇa. There was a Brāhmaṇa
village called Mahat at the foot of the Yāmuna mount-
ain, between the rivers Gaṅgā and Yamunā. This
Brāhmaṇa was born and brought up here. There is a
story in Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 92, about him, which
says that by mistake he was taken to hell by Kāla's
messenger and that he was reluctant to leave hell. The
story is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Yama (Kāla) ordered his agent to bring the
Brāhmaṇa named Yajñadatta, who lived in Mahat village,
born in Vasiṣṭha gotra and was gentle, scholarly and
well-versed in Yajña practices. He was specially warned
that he should not make a mistake as there was another
Brāhmaṇa with the same name who lived in the neigh-
bourhood and who resembled Yajñadatta in appearance,
learning and in every other respect. But in spite of Yama's
specific warning, his agent brought the wrong person.
<div n="NI"/>Yama, with his sense of justice, received him with due
respect and allowed him to return to the world. But
Yajñadatta was not willing to return to the world.
