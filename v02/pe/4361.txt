MANOGUṆA¦. Man may do many things, right or
wrong, good or bad, but it is the purity of your mind
that matters. The following story is to illustrate how
much your life depends on the quality of your thoughts
(Manoguṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Once on the shores of Gaṅgā a Brāhmaṇa and a
Caṇḍāla sat side by side and performed penance. After
some days of foodless penance the Brāhmaṇa felt hungry
and his thoughts went to the fishermen he had seen
earlier. He thought thus, “Oh how happy are these
fishermen. They catch good fishes and eat to their
heart's content and are happy. They are the luckiest
people of this world”. The thoughts of the Caṇḍāla
also went to the fishermen. But he thought thus: “Oh
how cruel are these fishermen! How many innocent
lives do they destroy to fill their belly. They must be
demons to do so.” Both of them died after some days
and the Brāhmaṇa was born as a fisherman and the
Caṇḍāla a prince. Both of them were re-born near
their abodes in their previous birth and both remem-
bered their previous lives. The Caṇḍāla was happy but
[Page481-a+ 65]
the Brāhmaṇa regretted his fault. (Taraṅga 1, Madana-
mañcukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
