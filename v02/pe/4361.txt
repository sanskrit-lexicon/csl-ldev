MANOGUṆA¦. Man may do many things, right or
<div n="lb"/>wrong, good or bad, but it is the purity of your mind
<div n="lb"/>that matters. The following story is to illustrate how
<div n="lb"/>much your life depends on the quality of your thoughts
<div n="lb"/>(Manoguṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Once on the shores of Gaṅgā a Brāhmaṇa and a
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍāla sat side by side and performed penance. After
<div n="lb"/>some days of foodless penance the Brāhmaṇa felt hungry
<div n="lb"/>and his thoughts went to the fishermen he had seen
<div n="lb"/>earlier. He thought thus, “Oh how happy are these
<div n="lb"/>fishermen. They catch good fishes and eat to their
<div n="lb"/>heart's content and are happy. They are the luckiest
<div n="lb"/>people of this world”. The thoughts of the Caṇḍāla
<div n="lb"/>also went to the fishermen. But he thought thus: “Oh
<div n="lb"/>how cruel are these fishermen! How many innocent
<div n="lb"/>lives do they destroy to fill their belly. They must be
<div n="lb"/>demons to do so.” Both of them died after some days
<div n="lb"/>and the Brāhmaṇa was born as a fisherman and the
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍāla a prince. Both of them were re-born near
<div n="lb"/>their abodes in their previous birth and both remem-
<div n="lb"/>bered their previous lives. The Caṇḍāla was happy but
[Page481-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa regretted his fault. (Taraṅga 1, Madana-
<div n="lb"/>mañcukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
