<Poem>Ṛtamuñchaśilaṃ jñeyam
Amṛtaṃ syādayācitam /
Mṛtantu yācitaṃ bhaikṣam
Pramṛtaṃ karṣaṇaṃ smṛtam //
Satyānṛtantu vāṇijyam
tena caivāpi jīvyate /
Sevā śvavṛttirākhyātā
Tasmāt tāṃ parivarjjayet //</Poem>
(Ślokas 5 and 6, Chapter 4. Manusmṛti)
<div n="NI"/>(Ṛtam is the collection of grains from paddy fields with
two fingers. Amṛta is that which is obtained without
begging and Mṛta is that which is obtained by begging.
Wealth that is obtained by agriculture is Pramṛta and
that which is obtained by trade is Satyānṛta. Wealth
obtained by sevā (flattery and service) is to be avoided.)
