KĪRTISENĀ¦. A heroine who has firmly established her
<div n="lb"/>reputation in Sanskrit literature. An exceptionally
<div n="lb"/>good woman, Kīrtisenā was the daughter of a merchant
<div n="lb"/>called Dhanapāla in Pāṭalīputra, and was married by
<div n="lb"/>another merchant called Devasena. Once Devasena
<div n="lb"/>left the country for purposes of trade, and during his
<div n="lb"/>absence from home the mother-in-law of Kīrtisenā shut
<div n="lb"/>her up in a dark room. But, with the help of an iron
<div n="lb"/>rod, which fortunately came to her hands she made a
<div n="lb"/>hole in the room at night, and through it escaped
<div n="lb"/>from captivity. Hungry and thirsty, Kīrtisenā travelled
<div n="lb"/>a long distance in the forest, and at night climbed a
<div n="lb"/>tree and rested thereon. Presently a Rākṣasa woman
<div n="lb"/>with her children came to the foot of the tree.
<div n="NI"/>During this period the King of Vasudattapura was
<div n="lb"/>suffering from pain in the head because a bug entered
<div n="lb"/>his ear and multiplied there in numbers. All the
<div n="lb"/>physicians gave up the case as incurable. But, the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasī at the foot of the tree advised the following
<div n="lb"/>cure for the King's illness to her children:—“Anoint
<div n="lb"/>the King's head with ghee and make him lie in the
<div n="lb"/>sun at noon. After that insert a small tube into his
<div n="lb"/>ear, and keep the other end of the tube in a pot full
<div n="lb"/>of water. Then the bugs will come out from the ear
<div n="lb"/>into the water, and the King will be cured of his ill-
<div n="lb"/>ness.
<div n="NI"/>Kīrtisenā, who heard this medical advice from her
<div n="lb"/>seat on top of the tree disguised herself as a physician,
<div n="lb"/>went to the palace and cured the King of his troubles.
<div n="lb"/>In her disguise, she continued to live in the palace as
<div n="lb"/>a friend of the King. Shortly, her husband Devasena,
<div n="lb"/>came there and they were happily reunited. The King
<div n="lb"/>gave them costly presents. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madana-
<div n="lb"/>mañjukālambaka, Taraṅga 3).
