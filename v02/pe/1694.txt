DAMANAKAM¦. The Tātiri tree (Grislea Tomentosa).
<div n="lb"/>The ceremony of worshipping this tree is called Dama-
<div n="lb"/>nakārohaṇavidhi. The Grislea tree is supposed to be
<div n="lb"/>Bhairava, who had been changed to a tree by the curse
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva. A story to this effect occurs in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Bhairava was formed from the anger of Śiva. Bhairava,
<div n="lb"/>against the will of Śiva, destroyed the devas, and so
<div n="lb"/>Śiva cursed him and turned him to a Tātiri tree. It is
<div n="lb"/>called Damanaka because Bhairava tried to do ‘damana’
<div n="lb"/>(restraint or punishment) to the gods.
<div n="NI"/>Bhairava felt sorry at the curse of Śiva. He requested
<div n="lb"/>Śiva to withdraw the curse. At last Śiva had pity on him
<div n="lb"/>and said that all would worship Damanaka tree. The
<div n="lb"/>method of that worship is called Damanakārohaṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vidhi. It is given below:
<div n="NI"/>This tree should be worshipped on the seventh or thir-
<div n="lb"/>teenth lunar day. The worshipper should go to the
<div n="lb"/>tree, with those who recite mantras and spells. After
<div n="lb"/>the worship is over the worshipper should say, “O,
<div n="lb"/>Tree, which has originated by the power of Hari, you
<div n="lb"/>come to my presence. On behalf of Śiva, and by his
<div n="lb"/>order, I have to take you home.” Saying thus the
<div n="lb"/>tree should be taken home and consecrated in the even-
<div n="lb"/>ing in accordance with the rituals. In the house, the
<div n="lb"/>Sun, Śiva and Agni should be evoked and worshipped
<div n="lb"/>and then the root of the tree should be planted in the
<div n="lb"/>Īśāna (N.E. point) corner of the house and when it
<div n="lb"/>is planted, the spell or incantation of Vāmadeva Mantra
<div n="lb"/>or Śiromantra should be recited. In the same way
<div n="lb"/>the trunk with the branches of the tree is planted on
<div n="lb"/>the Northern part. The fallen leaves and flowers
<div n="lb"/>should be placed on the eastern side. When the root
<div n="lb"/>is planted the following prayer should be uttered:

<div n="lb"/>prātaḥ kāle mayā prabho /
<div n="lb"/>Kartavyastapaso lābhāḥ
<div n="lb"/>Pūrṇaṃ sarvaṃ tavājñayā. //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>After that at dawn he should take bath and with obla-
<div n="lb"/>tions of sweet-smelling flowers etc. should worship
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. This is Damanakārohaṇavidhi. (Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 80).
