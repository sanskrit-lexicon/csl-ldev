PIṄGALĀ III¦. A woman of the city of Ayodhyā. Once
this woman approached Śrī Rāma with amorous
intentions and Śrī Rāma who was strictly observing a
vow of one-wife refused to satisfy her desire and said:—
“During the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa you will be born as a
servant maid of Kaṃsa and then I will in my form as
Kṛṣṇa accept you.”
[Page589-b+ 64]
Sītā on hearing this cursed Piṇgalā. She said “Oh
beautiful woman who has approached my husband
with amorous intentions, you will have three bends in
your body when you are born next as the servant maid
of Kaṃsa.” Piṅgalā weeping bitterly craved for
pardon and then Sītā said that Kṛṣṇa would make her
perfect. (Vilāsa Kāṇḍa, Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa).
