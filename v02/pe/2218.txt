DŪTALAKṢAṆA¦(M). The word ‘dūta’ has a special
meaning in Viṣavidyā. If a man is bitten by a snake,
the man who goes to the Viṣavaidya to speak to him
about it and bring him if necessary is called ‘dūta’.
From the external signs and symbols of the dūta and
from words spoken by him the viṣavaidya understands
whether the person bitten by the snake would die or
survive. These signs and words of the ‘dūta’ are called
[Page265-b+ 63]
lakṣaṇas. The following are some of the important
dūtalakṣaṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) The caste of the person bitten by the snake and
the caste of the dūta.
<div n="NI"/>(2) The first word uttered by the dūta. If it is the
name of the patient, it has a special significance.
<div n="NI"/>(3) If the dūta makes an incomplete sentence, it is a
significant lakṣaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(4) The things carried by the dūta such as stick, rope,
knife.
<div n="NI"/>(5) The colour of the clothes worn by the dūta.
<div n="NI"/>(6) The tone in which the dūta speaks. These are the
lakṣaṇas from which the doctor knows whether the
patient can be cured. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brahma Parva,
Chapter 35, Verses 19, 20).
