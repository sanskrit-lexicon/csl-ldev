DŪTALAKṢAṆA¦(M). The word ‘dūta’ has a special
<div n="lb"/>meaning in Viṣavidyā. If a man is bitten by a snake,
<div n="lb"/>the man who goes to the Viṣavaidya to speak to him
<div n="lb"/>about it and bring him if necessary is called ‘dūta’.
<div n="lb"/>From the external signs and symbols of the dūta and
<div n="lb"/>from words spoken by him the viṣavaidya understands
<div n="lb"/>whether the person bitten by the snake would die or
<div n="lb"/>survive. These signs and words of the ‘dūta’ are called
[Page265-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>lakṣaṇas. The following are some of the important
<div n="lb"/>dūtalakṣaṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) The caste of the person bitten by the snake and
<div n="lb"/>the caste of the dūta.
<div n="NI"/>(2) The first word uttered by the dūta. If it is the
<div n="lb"/>name of the patient, it has a special significance.
<div n="NI"/>(3) If the dūta makes an incomplete sentence, it is a
<div n="lb"/>significant lakṣaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(4) The things carried by the dūta such as stick, rope,
<div n="lb"/>knife.
<div n="NI"/>(5) The colour of the clothes worn by the dūta.
<div n="NI"/>(6) The tone in which the dūta speaks. These are the
<div n="lb"/>lakṣaṇas from which the doctor knows whether the
<div n="lb"/>patient can be cured. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brahma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 35, Verses 19, 20).
