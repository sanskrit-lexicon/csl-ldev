BALĀHAKA IV¦. A king. Once Śiva gave this king a
vision of him in the shape of a cow-calf. After that in
the place where Śiva appeared as calf a Śivaliṅga
arose. It began to grow to the extent of an atom daily.
But the growth ceased, when an outcaste who became
so by Karma (action) visited it. (Skandha Purāṇa
3-2-27).
