CAKRA¦(Ṃ) I. Sudarśana Cakra (disc) of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>The Viṣṇu Purāṇa contains the following story about
<div n="lb"/>the origin of the Cakra.
<div n="NI"/>Sūryadeva (the Sun God) married Saṃjñā, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvakarmā. But, due to the insufferable heat of
<div n="lb"/>her husband the marital life of Saṃjñā became miser-
[Page166-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>able, and so she requested her father to lessen the heat
<div n="lb"/>of Sūrya. And, accordingly Viśvakarmā ground Sūrya
<div n="lb"/>on a grinding machine and thus diminished his efful-
<div n="lb"/>gence. But, the grinding could diminish only (1/8) of
<div n="lb"/>that effulgence, which glowing red-hot dropped on the
<div n="lb"/>earth, and with that Viśvakarmā made the Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>Cakra, the Triśūla, the Puṣpakavimāna and the
<div n="lb"/>weapon called Śakti. Out of those four things the
<div n="lb"/>Triśūla came to be possessed by Śiva, the Puṣpaka-
<div n="lb"/>vimāna by Kubera and Śakti by Brahmā. The Sudar-
<div n="lb"/>śana Cakra which was glowing like anything was
<div n="lb"/>deposited in the sea. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 3, Chapter 2).
<div n="lb"/>There is a story in the Mahābhārata as to how the
<div n="lb"/>Cakra thrown into the sea came into the possession of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. While Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were picnic-
<div n="lb"/>ing on the shores of the Yamunā Agnideva went to
<div n="lb"/>them and requested them to give Khāṇḍava forest to
<div n="lb"/>him for food. As Takṣaka, friend of Indra, was living
<div n="lb"/>in the forest the latter was causing heavy rains to fall
<div n="lb"/>there. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna realized the fact that Agni
<div n="lb"/>would be able to consume the forest only after subjuga-
<div n="lb"/>ting Indra. But, how to manage it? Then Agni said
<div n="lb"/>that he would supply the weapon to fight Indra with,
<div n="lb"/>and accordingly he meditated on Varuṇa, who pre-
<div n="lb"/>sented to him (Agni) a chariot and flag with monkey
<div n="lb"/>as symbol, a quiver which would never become empty
<div n="lb"/>of arrows, a bow called Gāṇḍīva and the Sudarśana
<div n="lb"/>Cakra. Agnideva gave the Cakra to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the
<div n="lb"/>other things to Arjuna. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>297).
