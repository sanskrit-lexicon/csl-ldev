KADRŪ¦. Wife of Kaśyapa and daughter of Dakṣaprajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Viṣṇu—
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā—Dakṣa—Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kadrū—Wife or daughter of Kaśyapa?%} Whether Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>was the wife or daughter of Kaśyapa is a question which
<div n="lb"/>remains unanswered still in the Purāṇas. Chapter 65 of
<div n="lb"/>Bhāṣā Bhārata states like this.
<div n="NI"/>The six spiritual sons of Brahmā are: Marīci, Aṅgiras,
<div n="lb"/>Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu. Marīci got a son
<div n="lb"/>named Kaśyapa and he married the thirteen daughters
<div n="lb"/>of Dakṣa, namely, Aditi, Diti, Kalā, Danāyus, Danu,
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pradhā, Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā, Muni
<div n="lb"/>and Kadrū. So according to this, Kadrū was the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>But the 14th Sarga of Araṇya Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa states:
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣaprajāpati got sixty illustrious daughters and of
<div n="lb"/>these Kaśyapa married—Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā
<div n="lb"/>Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Muni and Surasā. Krodhavaśā
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to eight daughters. They were: Mṛgī, Mṛga-
<div n="lb"/>mandā, Harī, Bhadramatā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Śvetā;
<div n="lb"/>Śurabhi, Surasā and Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>Tāmrā another wife of Kaśyapa gave birth to five
<div n="lb"/>daughters, namely, Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī
<div n="lb"/>and Śukī. Krauñcī gave birth to owls, Bhāsī to Bhāsas,
<div n="lb"/>Śyenī to eagles and vultures, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī to swans and
<div n="lb"/>Śukī to Natā. Natā gave birth to Vinatā.
<div n="NI"/>Thus, according to the Rāmāyaṇa Kadrū was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Kaśyapa born of his wife Krodhavaśā.
<div n="lb"/>Again Vinatā who is spoken of as the elder sister of
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū in Mahābhārata is the daughter of the grand-
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Kaśyapa. This means that Kadrū's mother
<div n="lb"/>and Vinatā's grand mother's mother were sisters. But
[Page363-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>both of them looked after Kaśyapa as if they were
<div n="lb"/>direct sisters.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kadrū, mother of serpents.%} Kadrū and Vinatā lived
<div n="lb"/>serving Kaśyapa. Kaśyapa was pleased with them and
<div n="lb"/>asked them what boon they wanted. Kadrū asked for a
<div n="lb"/>thousand serpents to be born of her and Vinatā asked
<div n="lb"/>for two sons who would be braver and more brilliant
<div n="lb"/>than the sons of Kadrū. Kaśyapa granted them what
<div n="lb"/>they asked for and when Kadrū and Vinatā became
<div n="lb"/>pregnant he left for the forest.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Kadrū delivered a thousand eggs and
<div n="lb"/>Vinatā two eggs. Both of them kept the eggs in warm
<div n="lb"/>jars and after five hundred years the thousand eggs of
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū burst letting out a thousand serpents. Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>became impatient and broke open an egg of hers. Out
<div n="lb"/>came from it a half developed being and that was
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa. Aruṇa cursed her for being impatient and said
<div n="lb"/>“You let me out half developed because of your over-
<div n="lb"/>anxiety and you will, therefore, become a servant of
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū. Keep the other egg for another five hundred
<div n="lb"/>years. Then a very powerful son will come out of it
<div n="lb"/>and that son will relieve you of your servitude to
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū”. So saying he rose up in the air and became
<div n="lb"/>the charioteer of the sun. After five hundred years the
<div n="lb"/>other egg of Vinatā broke and Garuḍa came out.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 16, Ādi Parva, M.B.)

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kadrū curses her sons.%} Once Kadrū called Vinatā to
<div n="lb"/>her side and asked her the colour of Uccaiśśravas, the
<div n="lb"/>horse of Indra. It was purely a white horse and Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>told so. But Kadrū said its tail was black. Each stood
<div n="lb"/>firm in her statement and then Kadrū made a bet. She
<div n="lb"/>who was defeated in the bet should serve the other as
<div n="lb"/>her slave. Vinatā agreed. Kadrū wanted to cheat Vinatā
<div n="lb"/>and so asked her sons to remain suspended from the
<div n="lb"/>tail of the horse in such an artful way that the tail
<div n="lb"/>would look black from a distance. Some of her sons re-
<div n="lb"/>fused to be a party to this deceit and Kadrū cursed
<div n="lb"/>them saying that they would all be burnt in the Sarpa-
<div n="lb"/>sattra of Janamejaya. Kaśyapa did not like the curse.
<div n="lb"/>But Brahmā came there and said that the serpents
<div n="lb"/>as a class were injurious to society and as such a curse
<div n="lb"/>of that nature was necessary. Brahmā then taught him
<div n="lb"/>Viṣasaṃhāravidyā (Treatment of snake-poisoning).
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 20, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
[Page364-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>6) {%Kadrū and children go to Rāmaṇīyaka.%} Once Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>told Vinatā. “Vinatā, take me to the island of Rāma-
<div n="lb"/>ṇīyaka in the middle of the ocean. It is a beautiful place
<div n="lb"/>to stay. Let your son, Garuḍa, take my sons to that
<div n="lb"/>place.” Vinatā took Kadrū and Garuḍa took her
<div n="lb"/>children during the journey. Garuḍa rose high up in the
<div n="lb"/>air nearing the sun and the serpents began to feel the
<div n="lb"/>heat unbearable and began to get charred. Kadrū then
<div n="lb"/>prayed to Indra and the latter then sent a heavy down-
<div n="lb"/>pour of rains. This saved the serpents from being burnt
<div n="lb"/>to death and they reached the island of Rāmaṇīyaka
<div n="lb"/>safe. (Chapters 25 and 26, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%}
