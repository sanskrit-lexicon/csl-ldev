ŪRDHVAPUṆḌRA¦. A mark worn on the forehead
with yellow ochre. This mark should be made by earth
or ochre, which should be taken from the top of a
mountain peak, banks of rivers, seashore, Śaivite temple
serpent-hill or from under a holy basil. The fruits of
wearing the mark will vary according to the colour of
the ochre. Black ochre will afford peace, red soil will
procure docility, yellow soil will get prosperity, and
white ochre will give duty or righteousness. As the fruits
vary according to the colour, so also it will vary accord-
ing to the finger used to put the sign. If the mark is
[Page810-b+ 65]
made with the thumb the man will become stout. If it
is done with the middle finger he will have long life. If
it is done with the fourth finger (anāmikā), he will get
food and if it is made with the index finger (tarjanī) he
will get salvation. The form of the mark also could be
changed. The mark may be made in the form of a
flame, the leaf of bamboo reed, a lotus-bud, a fish, a
turtle or a conch. If the mark is as large as ten finger-
breadths it is superfine. If of nine finger-breadths, it is
medium super-fine; and if it is eight and a half finger-
breadths, it is lower superfine. In the same way if the
finger-breadth of the mark is seven, six or five they will
be super medium, medium medium and lower medium.
If it is four, three and two they will be of the low,
medium low and lowest.
<div n="NI"/>It is also ordered that when one wears the Ūrdhva-
puṇḍra in a particular spot of the body one will have to
think of a particular name of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>“Keśava in the forehead, Nārāyaṇa in the stomach,
Mādhava in the heart, Govinda in the neck, Viṣṇu on
the right side of the stomach, Madhusūdana on the
middle of right hand, Trivikrama on the left ear,
Vāmana on the left side of stomach, Śrīdhara on the
left hand, Hṛṣīkeśa on the right ear. Padmanābha on
the hinder Part, Dāmodara on the nape and Vāsudeva
on the head, should be meditated upon.” (Devī Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 11).
