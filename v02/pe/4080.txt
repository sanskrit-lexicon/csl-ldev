MAGA¦ (S). The brahmins residing in the island of Śāka
are generally called Magas. The Brahmaparva of Bhavi-
ṣya Purāṇa and the Sāmba Purāṇa speak about the
Magas thus:
<div n="NI"/>Sāmba, son of Kṛṣṇa, did severe penance to please Sūrya-
deva and pleased with the unwavering devotion of
Sāmba, Sūrya gave him a luminous replica of himself
for worship. Sāmba constructed a beautiful temple by
the side of the Candrabhāgā river and installed the idol
there. He then brought from Śākadvīpa the brahmins
called Magas for conducting the ceremonies of the tem-
ple. All the eighteen families of Maga brahmins came
and stayed near the temple at the request of Sāmba.
