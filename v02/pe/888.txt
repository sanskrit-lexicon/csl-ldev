BALABHADRA¦. (Balabhadrarāma, Balarāma, Baladeva).
<div n="lb"/>The elder brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the eighth incarna-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Mahāviṣṇu.
<F>*) Since the life of Balabhadra is so mixed with that of Kṛṣṇa a complete life story of Balarāma could be had only if it is read along
<div n="lb"/>with that of Kṛṣṇa.</F>
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} When the number of wicked kings increased
<div n="lb"/>Bhūmīdevī (goddess of Earth) turned herself into a cow
<div n="lb"/>and took refuge in Mahāviṣṇu. Mahāviṣṇu then pro-
<div n="lb"/>mised to be born as the sons of Vasudeva named Bala-
<div n="lb"/>bhadrarāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa and destroy the wicked.
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva was the son of the Yādava, Śūrasena, King
<div n="lb"/>of Madhurā. To Devaka the brother of another Yādava
<div n="lb"/>King, Ugrasena, was born a daughter Devakī. The
<div n="lb"/>marriage of Devakī with Vasudeva was celebrated but
<div n="lb"/>on the same day an Aśarīriṇī (a heavenly voice from
<div n="lb"/>above) said that the eighth child of Devakī would
<div n="lb"/>kill Kaṃsa. Instantly Kaṃsa put both Vasudeva and
<div n="lb"/>Devakī in jail. The first six sons born to Devakī were
<div n="lb"/>killed the moment they were born by striking them
<div n="lb"/>against the ground. Devakī became pregnant for the
<div n="lb"/>seventh time. The babe in the womb was Ananta in-
<div n="lb"/>carnate by Viṣṇu's directive to be of help to him when
<div n="lb"/>he would also be born soon as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it
<div n="lb"/>was necessary to save the child from the cruel hands
<div n="lb"/>of Kaṃsa as it was certain he would kill the babe the
<div n="lb"/>same way he had killed all the others before. So he
<div n="lb"/>ordered Māyādevī to take the child from the womb of
<div n="lb"/>Devakī and place it in that of Rohiṇī, another wife of
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva. Māyādevī did so and the boy got the name
<div n="lb"/>Saṃgharṣaṇa, also because of this. The news spread
<div n="lb"/>that Devakī aborted. Rohiṇī delivered a boy and was
<div n="lb"/>named Saṃgharṣaṇa alias Balabhadrarāma. (Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The colour of Balarāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa is
<div n="lb"/>the eighth child of Devakī. The elder brother Balarāma
<div n="lb"/>is white in complexion while the younger, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is
<div n="lb"/>black in complexion. There is a story behind this. The
<div n="lb"/>devas decided to be born as Gopālas (shepherds) in the
<div n="lb"/>earth to be of help to Kṛṣṇa in his duty of killing the
<div n="lb"/>wicked. They informed Mahāviṣṇu of their decision
<div n="lb"/>and the Lord was immensely pleased. He then took
<div n="lb"/>one white hair from his head and said that it would go
<div n="lb"/>to Rohiṇī's womb and change into Balarāma and
[Page100-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>taking a black hair said that it would go into Devakī's
<div n="lb"/>womb and change into Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It was thus that
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadra became white and Śrī Kṛṣṇa black. (Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 199, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brothers.%} Balabhadrarāma had six brothers born of
<div n="lb"/>his mother Rohiṇī. They were: Gada, Sāraṇa, Durd-
<div n="lb"/>dama, Vipula, Dhruva, and Kṛta. (Navama Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) Till their marriage Śrī Kṛṣṇa spent his childhood
<div n="lb"/>in Aṃbāḍi and Balarāma, in Madhurā. Once the sage
<div n="lb"/>Garga went to the house of Vasudeva and it was he
<div n="lb"/>who then told the story behind the births of Balarāma
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa. Hearing this Vasudeva went to Madhurā
<div n="lb"/>and brought Balabhadrarāma also to Aṃbāḍi. Garga-
<div n="lb"/>muni then performed all those sacred rites which were
<div n="lb"/>usually done to boys of that age and both of them then
<div n="lb"/>remained in Aṃbāḍi. Several important events happen-
<div n="lb"/>ed during their stay here, notable among which are:
<div n="lb"/>Pūtanāmokṣam (killing of the demoness Pūtanā and
<div n="lb"/>giving her salvation). Śakaṭāsuravadha (killing the
<div n="lb"/>asura, Śakaṭa), Tṛṇāvarttavadha (killing the asura,
<div n="lb"/>Tṛṇāvartta), Vatsāsuravadha (killing the asura,
<div n="lb"/>Vatsa), Bakavadha (killing the demon bird, Baka),
<div n="lb"/>Aghāsuravadha (killing the asura, Agha), Dhenukā-
<div n="lb"/>suravadha (killing the asura, Dhenuka), Kāliamardana
<div n="lb"/>(beating the snake, Kālia) and Pralambavadha (killing
<div n="lb"/>Pralamba). (See under Kṛṣṇa for more details).
<div n="NI"/>Kaṃsa conducted a Cāpapūjā (worship of the bow) to
<div n="lb"/>kill Kṛṣṇa. It was on a festive scale and both Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Balarāma went to Madhurā to attend the same. There
<div n="lb"/>they killed Kaṃsa and after that went to the āśrama
<div n="lb"/>of Sāndīpani Maharṣi for education. When they complet-
<div n="lb"/>ed their education they at the request of the preceptor
<div n="lb"/>gave as Gurudakṣiṇā (The fee you pay in the end for
<div n="lb"/>the instructions given) the lost child of the guru. Then
<div n="lb"/>they went to Madhurā and there several events took
<div n="lb"/>place, important among which was the fight between
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Jarāsandha. By this time the Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>were becoming lean financially and so to make some
<div n="lb"/>money Kṛṣṇa and Rāma went to the diamond-infested
<div n="lb"/>mountain of Gomantaka. On their way they met
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma doing penance under a Banyan tree. On
<div n="lb"/>the advice of Paraśurāma they killed Sṛgālavasudeva
<div n="lb"/>and got immense wealth. On their return Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa along with many Yādavas went and settled down
<div n="lb"/>in the island, Dvārakā, in the western ocean. (Daśama
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Marriage.%} Before the advent of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>the island Dvārakā was known as Kuśasthalī. It was
<div n="lb"/>ruled over by a famous Rājarṣi, Revata. This king was
<div n="lb"/>the son of King Ānartta and grandson of emperor
<div n="lb"/>Śaryāti. Revata got a hundred sons, Kukudmin being
<div n="lb"/>the first and a daughter named Revatī. When the time
<div n="lb"/>for marriage of his daughter came the King was anxious
<div n="lb"/>to find out a fitting husband for her and he went to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaloka to take the advice of Brahmā. Revatī also
<div n="lb"/>accompanied him. There stupefied he saw Vedas, Yajñas,
<div n="lb"/>mountains, rivers, oceans, Ṛtus, all in divine figures
<div n="lb"/>standing before Brahmā, worshipping him. The sweet
<div n="lb"/>celestial songs gave them both untold happiness. He
<div n="lb"/>then told Brahmā the purpose of his visit and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>meditating for some time told him that Balabhadrarāma,
<div n="lb"/>son of Vasudeva, was the only one person suited for
<div n="lb"/>her. The king returned to Dvārakā and gave his
[Page100-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>daughter in marriage to Balarāma. (Saptama Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%A pilgrimage.%} When the great Pāṇḍava-Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>battle started Kṛṣṇa became the charioteer of Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and Balarāma went to the forest, Naimiśa. He was not
<div n="lb"/>much interested in the battle. At the forest of Naimiṣa
<div n="lb"/>he saw Sūta telling Purāṇic stories to the several sages
<div n="lb"/>assembled there before him. Sūta did not rise up when
<div n="lb"/>he saw Balarāma and the latter moved to anger very
<div n="lb"/>soon cut off the head of Sūta. The sages assembled there
<div n="lb"/>decried the act of Balarāma and lamented deeply over
<div n="lb"/>the incident. At this Balarāma promised that he would
<div n="lb"/>give birth, from the dead body of Sūta, to one who will
<div n="lb"/>be well versed in all the Vedas, śāstras and sciences. The
<div n="lb"/>sages then blessed Balarāma.
<div n="NI"/>During that time there lived in the vicinity of Naimiṣa
<div n="lb"/>forest a demon called Balvala (Vatkala). He used to
<div n="lb"/>annoy the sages there and the sages requested Bala-
<div n="lb"/>rāma to put a stop to the atrocities of that demon. He
<div n="lb"/>immediately killed the demon by his weapon, Hala,
<div n="lb"/>and then raised from the dead body of Sūta a paṇḍita
<div n="lb"/>of great erudition. Later, to remedy the sin of killing
<div n="lb"/>Sūta, Balarāma, repentant, visited all the sacred places
<div n="lb"/>in Bhārata. Once when he heard about the grim battle
<div n="lb"/>between Duryodhana and Bhīmasena, he went to the
<div n="lb"/>battle-field and tried his best to stop the war. Dis-
<div n="lb"/>appointed he returned to Dvārakā. (Daśama Skandha,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 79, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Death.%} Once the ṛṣis Nārada, Kaṇva and Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra came to Dvārakā. To make fun of them some of
<div n="lb"/>the Yādavas dressed a Yādava like a pregnant woman
<div n="lb"/>and producing her before the sages asked them what
<div n="lb"/>child she would deliver. Enraged at this the munis
<div n="lb"/>said in one voice that she would deliver a mace and that
<div n="lb"/>iron mace would be the cause of the end of all
<div n="lb"/>Yādavas.
<div n="NI"/>After the Mahābhārata battle the Yādava dynasty re-
<div n="lb"/>mained alive only for thirtysix years. After that by
<div n="lb"/>the curse of the brahmin the Yādavas were all killed in
<div n="lb"/>a drunken brawl between themselves in the very pre-
<div n="lb"/>sence of Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra. This happened on the
<div n="lb"/>shore of Prabhāsa tīrtha and Balarāma was sitting
<div n="lb"/>there then in deep meditation. Suddenly the soul of
<div n="lb"/>Balarāma went out from his mouth in the shape of a
<div n="lb"/>white serpent and the serpent entering the nether world
<div n="lb"/>was given a warm welcome by the prominent serpents
<div n="lb"/>there. (Mausala Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other details.%}

<div n="NI"/>(4) He was present at the marriage of Abhimanyu
