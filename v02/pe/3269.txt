KAPAṬABHIKṢU¦. A false sage. To illustrate the fact
<div n="lb"/>that if a man fails in his deceit he will be subjected to
<div n="lb"/>ridicule, a story of a false sage occurs in Kathāsaritsā-
<div n="lb"/>gara. Since this Character has earned a place in the
<div n="lb"/>Indian literature his story is given below:
<div n="NI"/>There was once a city called Mākandī on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the river Gaṅgā. In that city lived a sage who
<div n="lb"/>observed silence as a Vrata. One day when he went
<div n="lb"/>begging he saw a beautiful girl in a Vaiśya's house and
<div n="lb"/>the false ascetic was attracted by her. Breaking his
<div n="lb"/>silence he said “What a pity!” and left the place. The
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya was worried why the sage said so and approached
<div n="lb"/>him and asked why he broke his silence to say so. The
<div n="lb"/>sage said: “Your daughter is ill-omened. If you give her
<div n="lb"/>in marriage all of you remaining will perish. So pack her
<div n="lb"/>in a box and with a torch burning on the top of it set it
<div n="lb"/>afloat on the river.” The Vaiśya did so.
<div n="NI"/>The sage coming to his Āśrama called his disciples to
<div n="lb"/>his side and said “To-night a box with a torch burning
<div n="lb"/>on the top of it will come floating on the river. You
<div n="lb"/>must take it and bring it to me without opening it.”
<div n="NI"/>The disciples went to the river and seeing the box
<div n="lb"/>coming floating caught it and took it to their preceptor.
<div n="lb"/>But from a point high up in the river a prince had seen
<div n="lb"/>the box coming floating and had opened it. He had
<div n="lb"/>then released the girl from the box and had floated the
<div n="lb"/>box again filling it with a black monkey. When the
<div n="lb"/>disciples got the box to the guru he said “Take it up-
<div n="lb"/>stairs and keep it there. There is a Pūjā to be conduct-
[Page388-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ed with the recital of sacred verses. It should not be
<div n="lb"/>seen by others. You can all go to sleep.”
<div n="NI"/>The false sage went up eager to enjoy the girl in the
<div n="lb"/>box and opened the box with pleasant thoughts. But to
<div n="lb"/>his utter horror there jumped from the box a ferocious
<div n="lb"/>black monkey who mauled him terribly. The Kapaṭa-
<div n="lb"/>bhikṣu was fooled. (Taraṅga 1. Lāvāṇakalambaka,
<div n="lb"/>Kathāsaritsāgara).
