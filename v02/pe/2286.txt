ELĀPUTRA¦. A serpent born to Kaśyapa of his wife
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū. This serpent was very intelligent. Once there
<div n="lb"/>arose a dispute between Vinatā and Kadrū over the
<div n="lb"/>colour of the tail of the horse of Indra, Uccaiḥśravas.
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū argued that there were black hairs in the tail
<div n="lb"/>while Vinatā held there were none. Really there were
<div n="lb"/>no black hairs and Kadrū to win the argument wanted
<div n="lb"/>her sons to go and hang on the hairs to create a black
<div n="lb"/>colour. The serpents like Vāsuki and others refused to
<div n="lb"/>do so and Kadrū then cursed them saying that they
<div n="lb"/>would all be burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of
<div n="lb"/>Janamejaya. To take measures to get free from this
<div n="lb"/>curse a meeting of the serpents under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Śeṣa and Vāsuki was held and in that assembly Elā-
<div n="lb"/>putra made a stirring speech. (Chapter 38, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
