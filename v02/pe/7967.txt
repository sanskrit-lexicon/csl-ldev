VĀMADEVA¦. An ancient hermit.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Vāmadeva and Śala.%} Three sons named Śala, Dala
and Bala were born to King Parīkṣit by his wife Suśo-
bhanā, a princess of Maṇḍūka. In due course, King
Parīkṣit anointed his eldest son Śala as King and went
to the forest for penance.
<div n="NI"/>Once Śala went to the forest to hunt. While chasing
a deer, the King asked his charioteer to bring horses
capable of overtaking the deer. The charioteer told the
King that such horses were available at the hermitage
of Vāmadeva. They went to the hermitage of Vāma-
deva and got the horses on condition that they would
be returned.
<div n="NI"/>After the hunting, Śala reached his capital. Seeing the
beauty and the vigorous nature of the horses, the King
did not like to part with them. Vāmadeva sent his
disciple to the court of the King to take the horses back.
But the King sent him back empty-handed. Vāmadeva
got angry. He came in person and demanded his horses.
The King replied that Brahmins did not require such
horses. While these two were quarrelling with each
other, some fierce giants came there and pierced Śala
with a trident and killed him. (M.B. Vana Parva,
Chapter 192).
