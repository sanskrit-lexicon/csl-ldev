AHICCHATRA¦(M). A state under the sovereignty of
King Pāñcāla. On the completion of his studies under
Droṇa Arjuna brought before his preceptor King Dru-
pada as a captive in discharge of the duty he owed to
him as his master. Drupada then gave the state of
Ahicchatra to Droṇa and got his release. (M.B., Ādi
Parva, Ślokas 73 to 76, Chapter 137).
