BRAHMĀṆḌA¦. The word Brahmāṇḍa means the aṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā (aṇḍa-egg), the Supreme Being which is
<div n="lb"/>the root of the origin of the universe. At a time long
<div n="lb"/>ago, which is beyond reckoning, there was nothing but
<div n="lb"/>an egg. This egg was split into two and from it a male
[Page159-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>child with the radiance of innumerable suns came out.
<div n="lb"/>This wonderful child was helpless. After his birth he
<div n="lb"/>cried for a while, because of hunger and thirst. He
<div n="lb"/>got no help. There was nobody to feed it. So this
<div n="lb"/>wonderful child looked up and lay there. This help-
<div n="lb"/>less child was called ‘Virāṭpuruṣa’ (the next emanation
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmā) by those versed in the Purāṇas. The
<div n="lb"/>boy was so called because he was the most material
<div n="lb"/>of materiality. But he was an atom of atoms and the
<div n="lb"/>first figuration of God. From each pore of the skin of
<div n="lb"/>the great virāṭ, who was the base of all the worlds a
<div n="lb"/>universe came into being. Thus all the countless uni-
<div n="lb"/>verses were born. Each universe has its own trinity of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and devas (the bright ones), the
<div n="lb"/>protectors of the eight zones. One universe comprises
<div n="lb"/>fourteen worlds or realms, from Pātāla to the Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>loka (from the nether world to the upper world or
<div n="lb"/>the realm of Brahmā). Countless such universes exist.
<div n="lb"/>Over and above all these universes there is Vaikuṇṭha,
<div n="lb"/>and above Vaikuṇṭha there is another world with an
<div n="lb"/>area of fifty crore yojanas (leagues), called ‘Goloka’ (the
<div n="lb"/>world of cow). Only the two worlds Vaikuṇṭha and
<div n="lb"/>the Goloka are eternal. Bhūloka (the earth) consists
<div n="lb"/>of seven islands and sixty-four peninsulas. There are
<div n="lb"/>seven worlds above and seven worlds below. The seven
<div n="lb"/>upper worlds are Bhūloka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Jana-
<div n="lb"/>loka, Tapoloka. Satyaloka and Brahmaloka. Thus a
<div n="lb"/>universe consists of fourteen worlds. This is the idea
<div n="lb"/>given by the Purāṇas about Brahmāṇḍa. (Devī Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandhas 9).
<div n="NI"/>Mention is made, in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 7, about the construction of Brahmāṇḍa.
<div n="NI"/>This Brahmāṇḍa, like the seed of the Kapittha tree
<div n="lb"/>(Vitar—the wood-apple), is covered under, above and
<div n="lb"/>all around by aṇḍakaṭāha (egg-shell). The aṇḍa (egg)
<div n="lb"/>is covered by water ten times the egg in volume. This
<div n="lb"/>water-shell is covered by a shell of fire. Around the
<div n="lb"/>shell of fire there is the shell of air and the air-shell
<div n="lb"/>is covered with ether. Around the shell of ether there
<div n="lb"/>is the shell of Egoism of darkness. Over the shell of
<div n="lb"/>Egoism there is the shell of glory and the shell of
<div n="lb"/>glory is covered by Prakṛti, the Divine Nature. It is
<div n="lb"/>immeasurable. Prakṛti contains numberless Brah-
<div n="lb"/>māṇḍas. As oil exists in sesame, God pervades the whole
<div n="lb"/>universe. This is the connection between Prakṛti and
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣa. (The Nature and the Supreme Spirit).
