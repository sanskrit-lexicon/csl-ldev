KIṢKINDHĀ¦. An ancient kingdom of the monkeys in
South India. This kingdom is mentioned both in the
Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata.
During the Rāmāyaṇa period a monkey King called
Ṛkṣarāja was the ruler of Kiṣkindhā. He was childless.
[Page413-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Once upon a time a son called Bāli was born to Aruṇī-
devī by Indra, and another son called Sugrīva was born
to her by Sūrya. (See under Aruṇa). Both the boys
were brought up in the Āśrama of sage Gautama.
When they grew up, Indra handed them over to Ṛkṣa-
rāja, and thus Bāli and Sugrīva came to Kiskindhā.
After the death of Ṛkṣarāja, Bāli became King of Kiṣ-
kindhā and Sugrīva lived in the service of his brother.
At that time there was a very mighty Asura called
Dundubhi. Finding no one fit to fight with, he challeng-
ed Varuṇa. Varuṇa directed him to Himavān, whose
peaks he rent asunder, and played with. Then Himavān
told Dundubhi that he was of a peaceful nature and
that Bāli would be a match for him (Dundubhi).
Accordingly Dundubhi fought with Bāli and got killed.
Bāli cast away the corpse of Dundubhi. The blood
oozing out from the nose of Dundubhi fell on the
body of sage Mataṅga who was engaged in penance on
the peak Ṛṣyamūka. Bymeans of his divine powers, the
sage found out the origin of the blood contaminating his
body, and cursed that Bāli would die the moment he
set foot on the mountain.
<div n="NI"/>Dundubhi's son Māyāvī was enraged at the death of
his father. He went to Kiṣkindhā to take revenge on
Bāli, but got defeated by the latter in fighting. Māyāvī
took to his heels; Bāli followed him, and Sugrīva follow-
ed his brother. Māyāvī took refuge in a cave followed
by Bāli, and Sugrīva waited at the mouth of cave. Even
after one year neither Bāli nor Māyāvī emerged out of
the cave, but Sugrīva saw blood coming out of the
cave and heard Māyāvī roaring. Taking it for granted
that Bāli was killed, Sugrīva closed the mouth of the
cave, returned to Kiṣkindhā, and at the instance of his
subjects assumed kingship.
<div n="NI"/>But, Bāli forced open the cave, hurried back to his
kingdom, and interpreting the action of Sugrīva as
one purposely done to usurp the throne, drove
Sugrīva away and took for himself Sugrīva's wife. Thus
Bāli became again King of Kiṣkindhā.
<div n="NI"/>There is a mountain called “Bāli-kerā-mala”—mountain
prohibited to Bāli—in the eastern region of the former
princely kingdom of Travancore. Is it in any way con-
nected with Ṛṣyamūkācala?
<div n="NI"/>Sugrīva founded a new kingdom at Ṛṣyamūka moun-
tain. Mainda, Dvivida, Hanūmān and Jāmbavān
were the ministers of Sugrīva. It was while Sugrīva was
thus living on Ṛṣyamūkācala that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
came that way in the course of their search for Sītā. In
accordance with the agreement made between Sugrīva
and Rāma, the latter killed Bāli and crowned Sugrīva
as the King of Kiṣkindhā. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣ-
kindhā Kāṇḍa, and Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chap-
ter 280).
<div n="NI"/>During the triumphal tour of Sahadeva in the South he
fought against Kiṣkindhā, and after seven days' fighting
the monkeys saw Sahadeva off with a present of costly
gems.
<div n="NI"/>“Sahadeva fought against the monkey chiefs like
Mainda, Dvivida etc. for seven days, but neither of
them got exhausted, and the monkey chiefs, with
affection and gratitude asked Sahadeva to depart with
gems.” (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 31).
<div n="NI"/>During this period nothing was heard of Sugrīva,
Hanūmān and Jāmbavān in Kiṣkindhā. Might be
Sugrīva was no more. Hanūmān, after the death of Śrī
[Page414-a+ 65]
Rāma, lived in Gandhamādana in Kimpuruṣavarṣa.
(Bhārata and Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha). From the
story of Prasena it may be seen that Jāmbavan left
Kiṣkindhā and lived in another cave with his sons
and other relations. It was the other two ministers of
Sugrīva, Mainda and Dvivida, who were ruling Kiṣ-
kindhā when Sahadeva went there. The power and
prestige of Kiṣkindhā had begun to set by then, and in
course of time Kiṣkindhā ceased to exist but in name.
