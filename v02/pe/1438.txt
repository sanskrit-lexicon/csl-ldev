CANDRAHĀSA¦. Son of King Sudhārmika of Kerala.
<div n="lb"/>The following story about him is told in Jaimini Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha Parva.
<div n="NI"/>Candrahāsa, born under the star Mūlam had a sixth
<div n="lb"/>finger on the left foot indicative of poverty and of all
<div n="lb"/>other evils. And, therefore, on his birth enemies killed
<div n="lb"/>Sudhārmika and his wife followed him soon to the
<div n="lb"/>other world. The child thus left an orphan was taken
<div n="lb"/>to Kauṇḍalakapurī by a female inmate of the palace.
<div n="lb"/>But unfortunately the woman died within three years
<div n="lb"/>of the above incident. The child, just for very existence,
<div n="lb"/>took to begging. After sometime some women jointly
<div n="lb"/>took up charge of the boy. Once he went to the house
<div n="lb"/>of Dhṛṣṭabuddhi, minister of Kauṇḍala where a feast
<div n="lb"/>was in progress. The munis present there were impres-
<div n="lb"/>sed by Candrahāsa and prophesied that he would be-
<div n="lb"/>come a King. To Dhṛṣṭabuddhi, the munis said that the
<div n="lb"/>child would guard his wealth. Angry and suspicious at
<div n="lb"/>the prophesy of the munis Dhṛṣṭabuddhi asked his men
<div n="lb"/>to kill the boy. They led him to the forest. On the
<div n="lb"/>way Candrahāsa got a Śālagrāma (a small sacred stone
<div n="lb"/>which represented some upadevatā) which he applied
<div n="lb"/>very devotedly to his face. They did not in fact kill the
<div n="lb"/>boy, but cut off his sixth finger on the left foot and
<div n="lb"/>showed it to their master.
<div n="NI"/>Thus left alive in the forest by the murderers the
<div n="lb"/>boy was roaming about when the King af Kalinda on
[Page173-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>a hunting expedition saw the destitute boy, and taking
<div n="lb"/>pity on him took him back with him to the palace.
<div n="lb"/>The boy was put under the care of Medhāvatī, the
<div n="lb"/>King's consort. The king named him Candrahāsa. Since
<div n="lb"/>the King took a special interest in the education of
<div n="lb"/>the child he became adept in all arts and sciences. At
<div n="lb"/>the age of twelve Candrahāsa, with the permission of
<div n="lb"/>the king, set out on a triumphal tour, and the king
<div n="lb"/>welcomed Candrahāsa on his return after his glorious
<div n="lb"/>victory that brought him wealth.
<div n="NI"/>At the instance of the Kalinda king, Candrahāsa, sent by
<div n="lb"/>his messengers tribute to the Kauṇḍala king, who, under-
<div n="lb"/>standing from them that so much of wealth had been
<div n="lb"/>brought to the Kalinda king by Candrahāsa started at
<div n="lb"/>once for the Kalinda palace. On being told the whole
<div n="lb"/>story about Candrahāsa, Dhṛṣṭabuddhi, the minister of
<div n="lb"/>the King of Kauṇḍala made up his mind to do away with
<div n="lb"/>him somehow or other for which he despatched a letter
<div n="lb"/>to his son, Madana, through Candrahāsa.
<div n="NI"/>Candrahāsa on his way to Kauṇḍala slept on the banks
<div n="lb"/>of a river. Campakamālinī, the daughter of the King
<div n="lb"/>of Kauṇḍala and Viṣayā, daughter of Dhṛṣṭabuddhi
<div n="lb"/>happened to go to the river bank where Candrahāsa
<div n="lb"/>was sleeping. Campakamālinī, who became subject to
<div n="lb"/>great love for Candrahāsa removed the anklets on her
<div n="lb"/>feet and approached him slowly, and when she took up
<div n="lb"/>and read a letter she found lying beside him, she felt
<div n="lb"/>awe and sorrow to find therein a suggestion to poison
<div n="lb"/>him to death. Without wasting much time in thought she
<div n="lb"/>changed the word ‘viṣamasmai’ (give him poison) to
<div n="lb"/>‘Viṣayāsmai’ (give him Viṣayā) and put it in its former
<div n="lb"/>place. After some time when Candrahāsa awoke from
<div n="lb"/>sleep and reached Kauṇḍala city and delivered the letter
<div n="lb"/>to Madana its content pleased him very much. As for
<div n="lb"/>Viṣayā, she was spending her days in constant prayer
<div n="lb"/>that Candrahāsa should marry her. In the cir-
<div n="lb"/>cumstances the marriage of Candrahāsa and Viṣayā was
<div n="lb"/>solemnised on the earliest auspicious day.
<div n="NI"/>In due course Dhṛṣṭabuddhi returned to Kauṇḍala with
<div n="lb"/>all the wealth he could lay his hands upon after capturing
<div n="lb"/>Kalinda. He seethed with grief and rage at the news
<div n="lb"/>that Viṣayā had been married to Candrahāsa. All the
<div n="lb"/>explanations offered by Madana did not satisfy him. He
<div n="lb"/>persisted in his determination to kill Candrahāsa.
<div n="NI"/>The evil-minded Dhṛṣṭabuddhi one day asked Candra-
<div n="lb"/>hāsa to go and worship at the Devī temple after having
<div n="lb"/>made arrangements for his murder there. But, as fate
<div n="lb"/>would have it, it was Madana who, instead of Candra-
<div n="lb"/>hāsa, was killed. Even before the above incident had
<div n="lb"/>happened the Kauṇdala King had married his daughter
<div n="lb"/>Candramālinī to Candrahāsa, and after relinquishing
<div n="lb"/>the kingdom also in his favour the King took to the forest
<div n="lb"/>to lead a hermit's life.
<div n="NI"/>The above developments added fuel to the fire of anger
<div n="lb"/>in respect of Dhṛṣṭabuddhi, and when he saw in the
<div n="lb"/>temple precincts, his son's corpse he became well-nigh
<div n="lb"/>mad. Crying out that all this was the result of his having
<div n="lb"/>troubled the Vaiṣṇava Candrahāsa he dashed his head
<div n="lb"/>against the pillars of the temple and died.
<div n="NI"/>Candrahāsa was grieved over the death of Dhṛṣṭabuddhi.
<div n="lb"/>He worshipped Devī offering his flesh in the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>fire. Devī appeared and granted him two boons which
<div n="lb"/>helped him to bring Dhṛṣṭabuddhi and Madana back to
<div n="lb"/>life. And, when the Kalinda king and his wife, fearing the
<div n="lb"/>wicked Dhṛṣṭabuddhi were about to end their lives in
[Page173-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>flaming fire, Dhṛṣṭabuddhi went to them and imparted
<div n="lb"/>to them the secrets about the life of Candrahāsa. The
<div n="lb"/>Kalinda king and his wife dropped their former decision
<div n="lb"/>to end their life, and Candrahāsa took up the reins of
<div n="lb"/>government at the behest of the King. Candrahāsa,
<div n="lb"/>who won repute as a very powerful and effective ruler,
<div n="lb"/>during the Aśvamedha sacrifice of Yudhiṣṭhira captured
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial horse, and Arjuna, at the instance of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa had to enter into a pact with Candrahāsa, who
<div n="lb"/>promised him help for the success of the sacrifice. Candra-
<div n="lb"/>hāsa had a son called Makarākṣa by Viṣayā and another
<div n="lb"/>son, Padmākṣa by Campakamālinī.
