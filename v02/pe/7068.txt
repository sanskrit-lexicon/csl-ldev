SUMADA¦. A muni who did penance at Vimala on the
<div n="lb"/>Hemakūṭa mountain. When twelve years had passed
<div n="lb"/>thus Indra got frightened and deputed Kāmadeva to
<div n="lb"/>disturb the muni's penance. Many Deva women also
<div n="lb"/>accompanied Kāmadeva. All their attempts failed to
<div n="lb"/>have any effect on the muni. Ultimately Devī appeared
<div n="lb"/>before him and asked him to choose his boon to which
<div n="lb"/>he answered thus: “I do penance to regain my kingdom
[Page763-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>lost to enemies. Also, I should develop eternal devotion
<div n="lb"/>to you and finally attain salvation.”
<div n="NI"/>Devī assured him recovery of his lost kingdom which he
<div n="lb"/>would rule till the sacrificial horse of Śrī Rāma in con-
<div n="lb"/>nection with the aśvamedha yajña came to his kingdom.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Sumada conquered his enemies and became
<div n="lb"/>king in Ahicchatra. After many years, in connection
<div n="lb"/>with Śrī Rāma's aśvamedha, Śatrughna with the yājñic
<div n="lb"/>horse reached Ahicchatra. Sumada welcomed Śatrughna
<div n="lb"/>and in his company went to Ayodhyā and detailed
<div n="lb"/>everything to Śrī Rāma. He then abdicated his throne
<div n="lb"/>in favour of his son and attained salvation. See under
<div n="lb"/>Ahicchatra. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>13).
