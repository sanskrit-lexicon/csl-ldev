ŚUNAŚŚEPHA¦ (DEVARĀTA). The story of a Brāh-
maṇa youth who was to be offered as human sacrifice
and who was saved by Viśvāmitra, is famous in the
Purāṇas. The name of the Brāhmaṇa youth was Śunaś-
śepha. But even in the Purāṇas there are two versions
of this story. In one of them, Śunaśśepha is referred
to as the son of Ṛcīkamuni. In the other, it was Hariś-
candra who performed the yāga and Śunaśśepha who
was brought for sacrifice, was the son of a Brāhmaṇa
named Ajīgarta. After Viśvāmitra saved the boy, he
got another name, “Devarāta”. (For details of the two
versions, see under Ambarīṣa and the 4th Para under
Viśvāmitra).
