ŚUNAŚŚEPHA¦ (DEVARĀTA). The story of a Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa youth who was to be offered as human sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>and who was saved by Viśvāmitra, is famous in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas. The name of the Brāhmaṇa youth was Śunaś-
<div n="lb"/>śepha. But even in the Purāṇas there are two versions
<div n="lb"/>of this story. In one of them, Śunaśśepha is referred
<div n="lb"/>to as the son of Ṛcīkamuni. In the other, it was Hariś-
<div n="lb"/>candra who performed the yāga and Śunaśśepha who
<div n="lb"/>was brought for sacrifice, was the son of a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>named Ajīgarta. After Viśvāmitra saved the boy, he
<div n="lb"/>got another name, “Devarāta”. (For details of the two
<div n="lb"/>versions, see under Ambarīṣa and the 4th Para under
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra).
<div n="NI"/>Śunaśśepha later became a Maharṣi He composed
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 1st Aṣṭaka. Besides in Ṛgveda,
<div n="lb"/>1st Maṇḍala, 6th Anuvāka, 30th Sūkta it is stated that
<div n="lb"/>Indra had given a golden chariot to Śunnaśśepha.
