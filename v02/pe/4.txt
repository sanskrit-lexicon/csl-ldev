ABHAYAM¦. King Idhmajihva divided his kingdom
<div n="lb"/>Plakṣadvīpa into seven parts and gave them to his
<div n="lb"/>seven sons. Abhayam is one of the parts. The other six
<div n="lb"/>parts are:—Śivaṃ, Yamasaṃ, Subhadraṃ, Śāntaṃ,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣemaṃ and Amṛtaṃ. See “Idhmajihva”. (Bhāgavata,

<div n="lb"/>Bhīmasena. (See Foot-note)
