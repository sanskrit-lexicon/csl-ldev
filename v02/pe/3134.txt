KALĀVATĪ I¦. A daughter of the King of Kāśī.
<div n="lb"/>This gem of a woman worshipped the sage Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>and became a saint by obtaining the Śaiva Pañcākṣara
<div n="lb"/>(five letters pertaining to Śiva—Sivāya namaḥ). After-
<div n="lb"/>wards Dāśārha, King of Mathurā, married her. The
<div n="lb"/>King felt very hot whenever he approached her and
<div n="lb"/>he questioned her about it. She said she had received
<div n="lb"/>the Pañcākṣara Mantra even from childhood and
<div n="lb"/>sinners would feel the heat if they touched her. The
<div n="lb"/>King was greatly disappointed and Kalāvatī took him
<div n="lb"/>to Sage Garga to redeem him from all his sins. The
<div n="lb"/>sage dipped the King in the river Kālindī and when
<div n="lb"/>the King rose up all his sins flew away from his body as
<div n="lb"/>tiny birds. The King reaching the palace, embraced
<div n="lb"/>Kalāvatī and then he felt her body very cool and
<div n="lb"/>pleasant. They got a son also. (Pañcākṣaramāhātmya,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva Purāṇa).
