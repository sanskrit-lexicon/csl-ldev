DHARMAGUPTA II¦. A Nandarājakumāra belonging to
<div n="lb"/>the Lunar dynasty. Chapters 1, 2 and 13 of Skanda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa gives the following story about him.
<div n="NI"/>Once Dharmagupta went to the forests, hunting. Deeply
<div n="lb"/>interested in the game he never knew when it became
<div n="lb"/>dusk. It was late to go back to the palace and so decid-
<div n="lb"/>ing to stay in the forest for the night he climbed upon a
<div n="lb"/>tree and made a seat there to rest. After some time a bear
[Page226-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>followed by a lion came running and took refuge on the
<div n="lb"/>top of the same tree. The lion stood growling below.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing a man on the same tree the bear said “Oh, Prince,
<div n="lb"/>we are both in the same sad plight now. Believe me
<div n="lb"/>as a friend. We can spend the night on this tree safe.
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, go to sleep till midnight and I will keep
<div n="lb"/>watch over. After that I will go to sleep and you keep
<div n="lb"/>watch”. Gladly accepting the proposal the prince went
<div n="lb"/>to sleep and the bear kept vigil. Then the lion suggested
<div n="lb"/>to the bear to push down the prince. The bear replied
<div n="lb"/>that he would never cheat a friend and that it was a
<div n="lb"/>great sin also to do so. After midnight the bear slept
<div n="lb"/>and the prince kept watch over. The lion then suggest-
<div n="lb"/>ed to the prince to push down the bear. Thinking that
<div n="lb"/>he would be saved if the bear is given to the lion the
<div n="lb"/>unfaithful prince pushed the bear down. But the bear
<div n="lb"/>escaped catching hold of the branches lower down.
<div n="lb"/>Embittered at this the bear cursed Dharmagupta and
<div n="lb"/>made him mad.
<div n="NI"/>Then addressing Dharmagupta first and the lion next
<div n="lb"/>the bear said thus: “I am Dhyānakāṣṭha a sage of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhṛgu family. I can take any form I like. I cursed you,
<div n="lb"/>Dharmagupta, because you cheated a friend. This lion
<div n="lb"/>is Bhadra, one of the ministers of Kubera. Once he
<div n="lb"/>entered into sexual act with a bear in front of the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama of Gautama at midday and the sage cursed him
<div n="lb"/>and made him into a lion. The sage as a relief from the
<div n="lb"/>curse had further decreed that he would get his origi-
<div n="lb"/>nal form when he entered into a conversation with me.”
<div n="lb"/>When Dhyānakāṣṭha finished speaking the lion changed
<div n="lb"/>itself into the form of Bhadra.
<div n="NI"/>Dharmagupta remained mad and his father, the King,
<div n="lb"/>approached Jaimini for help. The sage said that the
<div n="lb"/>prince would be cured of his madness if he bathed in the
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkariṇī tīrtha. The king did as was suggested and
<div n="lb"/>Dharmagupta was cured.
