DHARMAGUPTA II¦. A Nandarājakumāra belonging to
the Lunar dynasty. Chapters 1, 2 and 13 of Skanda
Purāṇa gives the following story about him.
<div n="NI"/>Once Dharmagupta went to the forests, hunting. Deeply
interested in the game he never knew when it became
dusk. It was late to go back to the palace and so decid-
ing to stay in the forest for the night he climbed upon a
tree and made a seat there to rest. After some time a bear
[Page226-a+ 64]
followed by a lion came running and took refuge on the
top of the same tree. The lion stood growling below.
Seeing a man on the same tree the bear said “Oh, Prince,
we are both in the same sad plight now. Believe me
as a friend. We can spend the night on this tree safe.
Therefore, go to sleep till midnight and I will keep
watch over. After that I will go to sleep and you keep
watch”. Gladly accepting the proposal the prince went
to sleep and the bear kept vigil. Then the lion suggested
to the bear to push down the prince. The bear replied
that he would never cheat a friend and that it was a
great sin also to do so. After midnight the bear slept
and the prince kept watch over. The lion then suggest-
ed to the prince to push down the bear. Thinking that
he would be saved if the bear is given to the lion the
unfaithful prince pushed the bear down. But the bear
escaped catching hold of the branches lower down.
Embittered at this the bear cursed Dharmagupta and
made him mad.
<div n="NI"/>Then addressing Dharmagupta first and the lion next
the bear said thus: “I am Dhyānakāṣṭha a sage of the
Bhṛgu family. I can take any form I like. I cursed you,
Dharmagupta, because you cheated a friend. This lion
is Bhadra, one of the ministers of Kubera. Once he
entered into sexual act with a bear in front of the
āśrama of Gautama at midday and the sage cursed him
and made him into a lion. The sage as a relief from the
curse had further decreed that he would get his origi-
nal form when he entered into a conversation with me.”
When Dhyānakāṣṭha finished speaking the lion changed
itself into the form of Bhadra.
<div n="NI"/>Dharmagupta remained mad and his father, the King,
approached Jaimini for help. The sage said that the
prince would be cured of his madness if he bathed in the
Puṣkariṇī tīrtha. The king did as was suggested and
Dharmagupta was cured.
