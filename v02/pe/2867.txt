JANAMEJAYA V¦. Another King born in the dynasty
of Parīkṣit. He had a son called Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (Śānti
Parva, Chapter 150, Verse 3). He once committed
brahmahatyā (sin of killing a brahmin) and so had
been forsaken by his subjects. So he had to take to
the forest. His search for means to get rid of the sin
took him at last to sage Indrota, who made him per-
form Aśvamedha yajña. Thus, he got redemption from
the sin and he became Indrota's disciple also. (Śānti
Parva, Chapters 150-153).
