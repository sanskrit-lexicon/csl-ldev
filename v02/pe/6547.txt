SĀYAṆA¦. A hermit who was an expounder of the Vedas.
In course of time, due to the differences in languages
and grammar, the Vedas became difficult to be grasp-
ed. It was Yāska and Sāyaṇa who saved the Indians
from this difficulty. For the Vedas to be grasped easily,
Yāska made the Nirukta (Etymology) and Sāyaṇa
wrote the Book Vedārthaprakāśa.
