MĀRĪCA I¦. The uncle of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Birth.%} On the banks of the river Sarayū, there were
two states lying adjacent called Malada and Karūṣa.
The great sages conducted Jaladhārā (showering of
water) on the head of Indra to absolve him of his sin
of killing Vṛtrāsura at this place. At that time Mala (ex-
creta) and Karūṣa (spittings) of Indra fell at those places
and so they got the name of Malada and Karūṣa. At
that place was born after a few years a demoness named
Tāṭakā who had the strength of a thousand elephants.
A demon called Sunda married Tāṭakā and she got
two sons named Mārīca and Subāhu. (Sarga 24, Bāla
Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa and Bāla Kāṇḍa, Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mārīca in his previous birth.%} Mārīca was the servant
of the gate-keepers of Vaikuṇṭha. One day Mahāviṣṇu
was displeased by a conduct of his and he cursed him
to be born as a demon on earth. But he added that
Mārīcawould get salvation from the curse when he was
killed by Śrī Rāma in which capacity Viṣṇu would in-
carnate soon. He would then return to Vaikuṇṭha to
his original place. That was how Mārīca was born as
the uncle of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Āśrama life.%} Mārīca and Subāhu were two insepara-
ble brothers. They learned all tactics of war and their
hobby was to torment the innocent sages of the forests
(Sarga 19, Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa). When
the exploits of Mārīca became unbearable, Viśvāmitra
brought Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa from Ayodhyā for help.
The instant Mārīca heard the fierce twang of Rāma's
bow he fled to the other shore of the sea. From that
day onwards Mārīca grew matted hair and wore
barks of trees and spent his life in an āśrama. (Sargas
35 and 36, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were living in
the Daṇḍakāraṇya with Sītā they were annoyed by a
[Page487-a+ 65]
demoness named Śūrpaṇakhā. In the fight that ensued
very many demons were killed. Śūrpaṇakhā complained
to Rāvaṇa who decided to kill Rāma and carry away
Sītā. For this he sought the help of his uncle Mārīca.
Flying in his golden Vimāna and crossing mountains and
oceans he approached Mārīca and told him of his plan.
Mārīca who was aware of the force of Rāmabāṇa dis-
suaded Rāvaṇa from such a venture. But Rāvaṇa
persisted in his plan and gave Mārīca the following
instructions: “Become a golden deer with beautiful
white spots all over the body and roam about near the
āśrama of Rāma for his wife Sītā to see. I am sure Sītā
will request her husband Rāma to catch hold of you.
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa will follow you and Sītā will be
left alone. I will then carry away Sītā as Rāhu takes
Candrikā (moonlight) and live happily with her. I will
be contented if I can then tease Rāma who will be
lamenting over his separation from his wife”. Thinking
that it would be better to die at the hands of Rāma
than at the hands of Rāvaṇa, Mārīca agreed to do as
his nephew desired.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa and Mārīca came near the āśrama of Rāma in
Rāvaṇa's aerial chariot. Mārīca on alighting from it
took the form of a beautiful fawn and entered the pre-
cincts of the āśrama. The false fawn was capable of
attracting the attention of anybody. It is described
thus: “It appeared as a wonder to those who saw it.
It was golden in colour with blue horns with white
lines on it. The ears were like leaves of blue lotus and
the face was of the colour of red lotus. The lips were like
sapphire and the body beautifully shaped with sides
like yellow flowers. The waist was thin and well-shaped
and a rain-bow-coloured tail adorned its back. The
whole body was silver-spotted and the deer was a feast
for the eyes of anybody.”
<div n="NI"/>The deer went and grazed in places where it could be
seen by Sītā. It would run away from the āśrama and
graze hidden from Sītā but would come back again to
the vision of Sītā. It would mix with the deer of the
āśrama for some time and run away from them to dis-
tant places. Like a butterfly it flitted about always
trying to attract the attention of Sītā. Other deer appro-
ached it but on getting its scent flew away from it. The
false deer suppressing the demon-instinct in him to kill
and eat the animals which came near it played well the
role of a fawn.
<div n="NI"/>Sītā was enamoured of the deer and expressed to Rāma
her desire to get it. Rāma followed it and finding it
keeping a distance always got suspicious and shot it
down with an arrow. The deer cried “Hā Lakṣmaṇa”
and fell down dead. The cry was intended to mislead
Lakṣmaṇa and draw him also away from Sītā.
(Chapters 43-44, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
