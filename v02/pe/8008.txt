VARADĀNA¦. A holy place near Dvārakā. It was here
that Durvāsas gave Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa boons (Vara).
From that day this became a holy place. It is mentioned
in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 82, that those
who take bath in this holy place would obtain the
fruits of giving a thousand cows as alms.
