DĪRGHIKĀ¦ A daughter of Viśvakarman. She was
<div n="lb"/>abnormally tall, and since there was the Śāstric injun-
<div n="lb"/>ction that he who married such women would die
<div n="lb"/>within six months none came forward to wed her.
<div n="NI"/>Dīrghikā began a penance for a good husband. As it
<div n="lb"/>continued for years together symptoms of old age began
<div n="lb"/>to appear in her. At this juncture an old and ailing
<div n="lb"/>householder came there. On certain conditions he
<div n="lb"/>married Dīrghikā. After sometime, in obedience to the
<div n="lb"/>husband's wish Dīrghikā set out on a tour carrying him
<div n="lb"/>on her shoulders. Though Māṇḍavya cursed her hus-
<div n="lb"/>band on their way, due to the chastity of Dīrghikā the
<div n="lb"/>curse proved to be ineffective. The similarity in the
<div n="lb"/>stories of Śāṇḍilī and this Dīrghikā leads us to think
<div n="lb"/>that they might have been one and the same person.
