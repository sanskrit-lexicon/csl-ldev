DĪRGHIKĀ¦ A daughter of Viśvakarman. She was
abnormally tall, and since there was the Śāstric injun-
ction that he who married such women would die
within six months none came forward to wed her.
<div n="NI"/>Dīrghikā began a penance for a good husband. As it
continued for years together symptoms of old age began
to appear in her. At this juncture an old and ailing
householder came there. On certain conditions he
married Dīrghikā. After sometime, in obedience to the
husband's wish Dīrghikā set out on a tour carrying him
on her shoulders. Though Māṇḍavya cursed her hus-
band on their way, due to the chastity of Dīrghikā the
curse proved to be ineffective. The similarity in the
stories of Śāṇḍilī and this Dīrghikā leads us to think
that they might have been one and the same person.
