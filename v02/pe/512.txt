Besides these, there are four diggajas (elephants of the
universe) who bear the earth standing below in the
nether world. It is stated that the sons of Sagara who
went into the nether land in search of the lost horse of his
father saw these elephants. As they went to the east
they saw the huge elephant Virūpākṣa, holding the
earth on its head. It is said an earthquake occurs when
for a change it shakes its head. Going to the left of it
they saw the elephant Mahāpadmasama holding the
earth on its head on the south. Going again to the left
of it they saw Saumanasa holding the earth on its head
on the west and going to the left of it on the north
they saw Bhadra holding the earth on its head. (Vāl-
mīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 40).
