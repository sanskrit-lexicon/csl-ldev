Śantanu. Śantanu had two wives Gaṅgā and Satyavatī.
Bhīṣma was born of Gaṅgā. Vyāsa was born to Satya-
vatī before her marriage. from the hermit Parāśara.
After the marriage, from Śantanu, two sons Citrāṅgada
and Vicitravīrya were born to her. A Gandharva killed
Citrāṅgada. Bhīṣma brought the three daughters of the
King of Kāśī, Ambā, Ambikā and Ambālikā as wives
of Vicitravīrya, but on the way knowing that Ambā was
in love with the King of Śālva, she was sent back.
Ambikā and Ambālikā became the wives of Vicitravīrya.
Shortly Vicitravīrya also died. With a view to continue
the royal family, Satyavatī sent for Vyāsa, so that he
might beget children of Ambikā and Ambālikā. At
the time of coition Ambīkā closed her eyes to avoid
seeing the uncouth face of Vyāsa. So she got as son
Dhṛtarāṣṭra who was blind from birth. Seeing the ugly
figure of Vyāsa Ambālikā turned pale and so the son
born to her was pale in colour. He was called Pāṇḍu.
From Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Duryodhana and his brothers were
born and from Pāṇḍu were born the Pāṇḍavas. All
members born in the family of Kuru were known as
Kauravas. But later, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra came to be
known by the name ‘Kauravas’.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The origin of Kauravas.%} (Duryodhana and his bro-
thers). Dhṛtarāṣṭra married Gāndhārī the daughter of
Subala the King of Gāndhāra. Once Vyāsa reached the
palace weary with hunger and thirst. Gāndhārī gave
Vyāsa food and drink. Vyāsa was pleased with her and
told her that she might ask for any boon. She said that
she wanted to get hundred sons from Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
Vyāsa granted the boon. Gāndhārī became pregnant.
Even after two years she did not deliver. She heard that
Kuntī, the wife of Pāṇḍu had given birth to a child.
Gāndhārī became sad. She crushed her womb and gave
birth to a lump of flesh. Understanding this, Vyāsa
came there and cutting the lump into hundred and one
pieces kept them in ghee-pots. Advising Gāndhārī to
keep the pots in secret, Vyāsa went to the Himālayas.
The pots were broken at the proper time and hundred
sons and a daughter came out. Besides them Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra had another son named Yuyutsu by a Vaiśya
woman.
<div n="NI"/>The hundred and one sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra beginning with
Duryodhana are the Kauravas.
