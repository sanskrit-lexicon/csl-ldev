ĀBHĪRAS¦.
<div n="NI"/>{%A few details:%} 1) A low-caste people. People living in
the estuary of the rivers of Sindhū and Sarasvatī were
generally called Ābhīras. In the Sabhā Parva of Mahā-
bhārata we find Nakula defeating these people during
his victory march after the great Mahābhārata battle.
<div n="NI"/>2) Once Ābhīras went to Dharmaputra with many
gifts. (Ślokas 11-13, Chapter 51, Sabhā Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) Once it was prophesied by Mārkaṇḍeya Ṛṣi, that
low-caste people like Ābhīras and Śakas would become
rulers of states in different parts of Bhārata during
Kaliyuga. (Ślokas 35-36, Chapter 188, Vana Parva,
M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) In the Garuḍavyūha (Battle array named after
Garuḍa) which Droṇa created during the Kurukṣetra
battle he included Ābhīras also. (Śloka 6, Chapter 20,
Droṇa Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) Because of the hatred of Śūdras and Ābhīras a sac-
red lake named Vināśana disappeared from the river,
Sarasvatī. (Ślokas 1 and 2, Chapter 37, Śalya Parva,
M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) Ābhīras were Kṣatriyas formerly. Afraid of Paraśu-
rāma they fled and lived in mountain-caves not conti-
nuing their hereditary work and thus became Śūdras.
(Śloka 16, Chapter 29, Aśvamedhika Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>7) When Dvārakā was destroyed by floods and all the
Yādavas were killed Arjuna went north taking along with
him the wives of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. At that time Ābhīras were
among those who attacked and carried away the
women. (Ślokas 47-63, Chapter 7, Mausalya Parva,
M.B.).
