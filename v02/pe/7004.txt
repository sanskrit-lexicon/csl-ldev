ŚUKA I¦. (ŚUKADEVA). The son of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The sage Vyāsa once wished to have a son.
<div n="lb"/>So he began to worship Śiva for the purpose. His
<div n="lb"/>desire was to have a son who would combine in him
<div n="lb"/>the essential qualities of fire, earth, water, air and ether
<div n="lb"/>He did tapas for a hundred years. Because of the
<div n="lb"/>austerity of his tapas, his locks of hair began to blaze
<div n="lb"/>like flames of fire. At last Śiva appeared and blessed
<div n="lb"/>him to have a son according to his wish.
<div n="NI"/>After receiving his boon, Vyāsa returned to his āśrama.
<div n="lb"/>Soon after his arrival there, an Apsaras named Ghṛtācī
<div n="lb"/>came there in the form of a parrot. On seeing her
<div n="lb"/>beauty Vyāsa had an involuntary emission of semen.
<div n="lb"/>Śuka's birth was from this semen. (For further details
<div n="lb"/>see Para 2, under Ghṛtācī).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śuka's Boyhood.%} It was Śiva who performed the
<div n="lb"/>Upanayana (wearing the sacred thread) ceremony of
<div n="lb"/>Śuka. Since he was born out of the semen which was
<div n="lb"/>the result of the fascination for a parrot, the boy was
<div n="lb"/>named “Śuka”. He was a divine boy. Soon after his
<div n="lb"/>birth, he grew up into an exceptionally brilliant boy.
<div n="lb"/>He went to Bṛhaspati and mastered all knowledge.
<div n="lb"/>After staying with Bṛhaspati for some years, he re-
<div n="lb"/>turned to his father's āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%In Vyāsa's hut.%} Vyāsa was very happy at the arrival
<div n="lb"/>of his son after completing his education. In due course
<div n="lb"/>he thought of getting his son married to a suitable girl
<div n="lb"/>and to prepare him for an ideal Grhasthāśrama. But
<div n="lb"/>Śuka did not fall in with his father's proposal. All the
<div n="lb"/>efforts of Vyāsa to persuade him were in vain. At last
<div n="lb"/>he told Śuka that he was pleased with his stern resolve
<div n="lb"/>and allowed him to pursue his life as a Sannyāsī, if he
<div n="lb"/>wished for it.
<div n="NI"/>From that time Śukadeva and Sūta, the disciple of
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa began the study of Bhāgavata. But Śuka did
[Page757-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>not find happiness in that study either. Vyāsa taught
<div n="lb"/>him spiritual philosophy. Even then Śuka could not
<div n="lb"/>find mental satisfaction. So his father sent him to
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā. At that time there was none who equalled
<div n="lb"/>Janaka, the then King of Mithilā. Before sending him
<div n="lb"/>away, Vyāsa made his son promise that he would
<div n="lb"/>return to his āśrama, immediately after leaving
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śuka in Mithilā.%} Śuka started his journey to
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā on foot. He passed through many lands and
<div n="lb"/>cities on his way. He visited many places inhabited by
<div n="lb"/>different classes of people like yogins, sages, mendicants,
<div n="lb"/>Vaikhānasas, Śāktas, Pāśupatas, Sauras, Śaivas,
<div n="lb"/>Vaiṣṇavas, etc. After taking two years to cross Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>meru and one year for crossing Himālaya he reached
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā. At the very sight of the land of Mithilā with
<div n="lb"/>its inhabitants living in luxury and prosperity, Śuka-
<div n="lb"/>deva was filled with wonder.
<div n="NI"/>One of the sentries at the palace gate who saw the
<div n="lb"/>dignified bearing and majestic figure of Śuka, standing
<div n="lb"/>at the entrance, greeted him with joined palms and
<div n="lb"/>conducted him into the royal palace. From there, a
<div n="lb"/>minister took him to the interior of the palace, where
<div n="lb"/>a passage led him to a beautiful park full of flowering
<div n="lb"/>trees and swimming pools. After giving him a seat in
<div n="lb"/>the park the minister left the place. There, he was
<div n="lb"/>attended by women who were like celestial beauties.
<div n="lb"/>But Śuka was not happy even in their company or
<div n="lb"/>attentions. He spent the whole night in deep meditation.
<div n="lb"/>The next morning King Janaka visited Śuka. After the
<div n="lb"/>exchange of customary greetings, Janaka enquired of
<div n="lb"/>him the object of his visit. Śuka answered that he came
<div n="lb"/>there to learn from Janaka the way to salvation, as
<div n="lb"/>directed by his father.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Janaka said:—“After Upanayana,
<div n="lb"/>(investiture with the sacred thread) a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>should study the Vedas. He should discharge his debts
<div n="lb"/>to the Devas and to his Pitṛs by tapas, worship of the
<div n="lb"/>guru and Brahmacarya. After the study of the Vedas,
<div n="lb"/>after mastering the senses, he should give Gurudakṣiṇā
<div n="lb"/>(fee to the teacher). Then the pupil may return home
<div n="lb"/>with the permission of the Guru (preceptor). After
<div n="lb"/>reaching home he should begin gṛhasthāśrama. After
<div n="lb"/>the birth of children, he should follow Vānaprasth-
<div n="lb"/>āśrama. In that āśrama, a Brāhmaṇa should kindle
<div n="lb"/>fire in his soul. He should then renounce the dual state,
<div n="lb"/>rise above all desire and remain in Brahmāśrama.”
<div n="NI"/>After receiving Janaka's advice, Śuka returned to his
<div n="lb"/>father.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Domestic Life.%} Śukadeva married the beautiful
<div n="lb"/>Pīvarī, daughter of the Pitṛs and thus began his
<div n="lb"/>gṛhasthāśrama in Vyāsa's āśrama. He had four sons
<div n="lb"/>named Kṛṣṇa, Gauraprabha, Bhūri and Devaśruta and
<div n="lb"/>a daughter named Kīrti, by Pīvarī. Kīrti was married
<div n="lb"/>by Aṇu, the son of King Vibhrāja. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>1st Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Vyāsa composed Bhārata and taught it to Śuka.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Chapter 1, Verse 104).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Śukadeva recited the Mahābhārata story contain-
<div n="lb"/>ing 14 lakhs of stanzas to Gandharvas, Yakṣas and
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 106;
<div n="lb"/>Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 55).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Śukadeva taught them the entire Vedas and the
[Page758-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata story. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 63,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 89).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Śuka attended Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The End.%} While Śukadeva was thus leading his family
<div n="lb"/>life, teaching the Vedas and reading the Purāṇas,
<div n="lb"/>Nārada happened to pay a visit to him. His conversa-
<div n="lb"/>tion with Nārada drew Śukadeva nearer to the path of
<div n="lb"/>Mokṣa. He left his father, Veda Vyāsa and his own
<div n="lb"/>family, went to the peak of Kailāsa and stayed there
<div n="lb"/>doing tapas to Paramaśiva. At last he became a per-
<div n="lb"/>fect Siddha and rising up to the Heavens shone there
<div n="lb"/>as a second sun. Devarṣis began to praise Śukadeva.
<div n="NI"/>His father Vyāsa was in deep grief at his disappearance
<div n="lb"/>and left his āśrama in search of Śuka. After wandering
<div n="lb"/>in many places he came to Kailāsa where Śuka had per-
<div n="lb"/>formed tapas and called him. Śiva who saw him utterly
<div n="lb"/>tired and weak took pity on him and comforted him in
<div n="lb"/>the following words: “Did you not pray to me for a
<div n="lb"/>son who would combine in himself the essences of the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcabhūtas? As a result of the tapas you have done
<div n="lb"/>and by my blessing, such a glorious son was born to
<div n="lb"/>you. Śuka has attained the highest position which is
<div n="lb"/>inaccessible to those who have not conquered their
<div n="lb"/>senses and difficult to attain even by the gods. Why do
<div n="lb"/>you worry about Śuka? The glory acquired by your
<div n="lb"/>eminent son will continue undiminished as long as the
<div n="lb"/>mountains and oceans exist. I give you my blessing
<div n="lb"/>that an image exactly like your son will always accom-
<div n="lb"/>pany you from today.” Just then, an image which
<div n="lb"/>closely resembled his son appeared before Vyāsa who
<div n="lb"/>was filled with rapture.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that even today if any one calls Śiva at
<div n="lb"/>the place where Śiva spoke to Vyāsa in answer to his
<div n="lb"/>call, Śiva would respond to the call. (M.B. Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapters 332 and 333; Devī Bhāgavata, 1st
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
