MEGHANĀDA¦. Indrajit, son of Rāvaṇa. (Only
<div n="lb"/>portions which were left off under the entry Indrajit are
<div n="lb"/>given here.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Synonyms of Meghanāda.%} Kānīna, Rāvaṇi, Māyāvī,
<div n="lb"/>Indrajit. The origin of each name is given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Kānīna.%} Son of a virgin. In olden times, once, the
<div n="lb"/>Sea of Milk was churned. From it arose a beautiful
[Page500-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>maiden called Sulakṣaṇā. She became an attendant of
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī and one day while bathing in a pond in the
<div n="lb"/>garden she sent Sulakṣaṇā to fetch some clothes for her.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva who was then in Pārvatī's chamber alone, lost his
<div n="lb"/>control when he saw the beautiful Sulakṣaṇā and had
<div n="lb"/>intercourse with her. The maid was perplexed and then
<div n="lb"/>Śiva assured her that she would give birth to a child
<div n="lb"/>only after her marriage.
<div n="NI"/>But when Sulakṣaṇā returned with the dress Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>felt suspicious and she cursed her and made her into a
<div n="lb"/>frog and pushed it into that same pond.
<div n="NI"/>Time passed on. Once Maya performed severe penance
<div n="lb"/>to please Śiva to get a daughter and Śiva persuaded
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī to release Sulakṣaṇā from the curse and she did
<div n="lb"/>so turning her into a beautiful maiden named
<div n="lb"/>Mandodarī and Śiva gave her to Maya. Rāvaṇa married
<div n="lb"/>her and their first son was Kānīna.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Rāvaṇi.%} Son of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Meghanāda.%} (One having the sound of thunder).
<div n="lb"/>When he was born he made a sound as loud as thunder
<div n="lb"/>and so he was called Meghanāda.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Māyāvī.%} He accepted Śiva as his Guru and learned
<div n="lb"/>all the divine arts of magic like Mṛgendrajāla, Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mendrajāla, Surendrajāla, Mahendrajāla Khagendra-
<div n="lb"/>jāla, Vāyustambha, Jalastambha, Agnistambha, Ākāśa-
<div n="lb"/>sañcāra, Parakāyapraveśa, Rūpabhedasvīkāra and
<div n="lb"/>Tirodhāna. Because he knew all these tricks he was
<div n="lb"/>called Māyāvī.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Indrajit.%} When Rāvaṇa attacked svarga he pushed
<div n="lb"/>forward too much and so was caught inside an army
<div n="lb"/>of the Devas which surrounded him. When Meghanāda
<div n="lb"/>saw it he broke the army circle of the devas and getting
<div n="lb"/>in caught Indra as a prisoner and brought him to
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā. Indra was later released by the mediation of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā and the latter gave him the name Indrajit
<div n="lb"/>meaning “Conqueror of Indra”.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Boons.%} When Rāvaṇa was conducting his world
<div n="lb"/>campaign he performed at Nikumbhilā many yāgas
<div n="lb"/>and got from Brahmā many boons. Meghanāda
<div n="lb"/>acquired powers which had not been possible for
<div n="lb"/>mānavas, dānavas, vānaras or rākṣasas to acquire. He
<div n="lb"/>got a Vimāna (divine car) which could travel in all
<div n="lb"/>directions, backwards and forwards, up or down. He
<div n="lb"/>received an armour against which no weapon would be
<div n="lb"/>of any use. He possessed a weapon which would be
<div n="lb"/>effective against anything. Above all these, he had the
<div n="lb"/>power to remain invisible. He could be killed by only
<div n="lb"/>one person of his age who had lived for fourteen years
<div n="lb"/>dutifully and virtuously without sleep. Only Indrajit
<div n="lb"/>knew about this.
<div n="NI"/>In a battle Māyāvī would show many tricks. If one was
<div n="lb"/>found ineffective he would use another. He had in his
<div n="lb"/>stock over a thousand such tricks all of which he had
<div n="lb"/>acquired with very little effort. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
