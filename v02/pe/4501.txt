<div n="NI"/>1) {%Synonyms of Meghanāda.%} Kānīna, Rāvaṇi, Māyāvī,
Indrajit. The origin of each name is given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Kānīna.%} Son of a virgin. In olden times, once, the
Sea of Milk was churned. From it arose a beautiful
[Page500-b+ 65]
maiden called Sulakṣaṇā. She became an attendant of
Pārvatī and one day while bathing in a pond in the
garden she sent Sulakṣaṇā to fetch some clothes for her.
Śiva who was then in Pārvatī's chamber alone, lost his
control when he saw the beautiful Sulakṣaṇā and had
intercourse with her. The maid was perplexed and then
Śiva assured her that she would give birth to a child
only after her marriage.
<div n="NI"/>But when Sulakṣaṇā returned with the dress Pārvatī
felt suspicious and she cursed her and made her into a
frog and pushed it into that same pond.
<div n="NI"/>Time passed on. Once Maya performed severe penance
to please Śiva to get a daughter and Śiva persuaded
Pārvatī to release Sulakṣaṇā from the curse and she did
so turning her into a beautiful maiden named
Mandodarī and Śiva gave her to Maya. Rāvaṇa married
her and their first son was Kānīna.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Rāvaṇi.%} Son of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Meghanāda.%} (One having the sound of thunder).
When he was born he made a sound as loud as thunder
and so he was called Meghanāda.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Māyāvī.%} He accepted Śiva as his Guru and learned
all the divine arts of magic like Mṛgendrajāla, Brah-
mendrajāla, Surendrajāla, Mahendrajāla Khagendra-
jāla, Vāyustambha, Jalastambha, Agnistambha, Ākāśa-
sañcāra, Parakāyapraveśa, Rūpabhedasvīkāra and
Tirodhāna. Because he knew all these tricks he was
called Māyāvī.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Indrajit.%} When Rāvaṇa attacked svarga he pushed
forward too much and so was caught inside an army
of the Devas which surrounded him. When Meghanāda
saw it he broke the army circle of the devas and getting
in caught Indra as a prisoner and brought him to
Laṅkā. Indra was later released by the mediation of
Brahmā and the latter gave him the name Indrajit
meaning “Conqueror of Indra”.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Boons.%} When Rāvaṇa was conducting his world
campaign he performed at Nikumbhilā many yāgas
and got from Brahmā many boons. Meghanāda
acquired powers which had not been possible for
mānavas, dānavas, vānaras or rākṣasas to acquire. He
got a Vimāna (divine car) which could travel in all
directions, backwards and forwards, up or down. He
received an armour against which no weapon would be
of any use. He possessed a weapon which would be
effective against anything. Above all these, he had the
power to remain invisible. He could be killed by only
one person of his age who had lived for fourteen years
dutifully and virtuously without sleep. Only Indrajit
knew about this.
<div n="NI"/>In a battle Māyāvī would show many tricks. If one was
found ineffective he would use another. He had in his
stock over a thousand such tricks all of which he had
acquired with very little effort. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa,
Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
