<div n="NI"/>(i) Once Maitreya went to Hastināpura and told
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana that he should behave kindly to the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. Duryodhana who did not much relish the
<div n="lb"/>advice sat tapping on his thighs with his hands, not
<div n="lb"/>seriously attending to the sage. Maitreya was dis-
<div n="lb"/>pleased at the discourtesy and cursed that Bhīma
[Page469-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>would one day break Duryodhana's thighs. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Maitreya was a courtier of Yudhiṣṭhira. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>10, Chapter 4, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Maitreya was one among the sages who visited
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma while he was lying on his bed of arrows.

<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once he discussed with Vyāsa topics on Dharma.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 120, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) When Srī Kṛṣṇa died, the spiritualistic ideology of
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra became more dominant and he approach-
<div n="lb"/>ed Vidura for Dharmopadeśa. Vidura sent him to
<div n="lb"/>Maitreya. Dharmaputra went to the Āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Maitreya on the banks of the river Gaṅgā and after
<div n="lb"/>paying respects to him accepted Dharmopadeśa
<div n="lb"/>(Instruction in law, duty and morals) from him. (3rd
