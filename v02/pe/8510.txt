of the vow of four days, beginning with the second day
of the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Pauṣa,
with mustard; on the next day with gingelly seeds; on
the third day with Orris root and on the fourth day

as Śaśī on the first day, Candra on the second
day, Śaśāṅka on the third day and Indu on the fourth
