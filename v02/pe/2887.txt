JARATKĀRU II¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} It occurs in Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 9, about Jaratkāru, the sister of Vāsuki and
<div n="lb"/>the wife of hermit Jaratkāru as follows. This devī
<div n="lb"/>(goddess) is the daughter of Prajāpati Kaśyapa, born
<div n="lb"/>from his mind. So she got the name Manasādevī
<div n="lb"/>(goddess born from mind). Some think that she got
<div n="lb"/>the name Manasādevī because she is the deity of mind.
<div n="lb"/>There are some who imagine that she got the name
<div n="lb"/>Manasādevī because she held Śrī Kṛṣṇa Paramātman
<div n="lb"/>(the Supreme Spirit) firmly in her mind. This devī

<div n="lb"/>she got the attainments of Yoga (meditation, devotion,
<div n="lb"/>contemplation and other ways of union with the

<div n="lb"/>yoginī.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Once the serpents became a plague to the
<div n="lb"/>men of the earth and they all went to Prajāpati
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa and made their complaints. Kaśyapa and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā consulted each other and at the instruction of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā Kaśyapa created several Mantras (spells and
<div n="lb"/>incantations) and Manasādevī from his mind as the
<div n="lb"/>deity of these spells.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Power of her tapas (penance).%} When she was very
<div n="lb"/>young she went to Kailāsa and performed penance to
<div n="lb"/>Paramaśiva for a thousand years. At last Śiva appeared
<div n="lb"/>before her and gave her the divine knowledge, and
<div n="lb"/>taught her the Sāmaveda. He gave her the divine Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa mantra (a spell) called ‘Aṣṭākṣarī’ and the
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa Kavaca (the armour of Kṛṣṇa) called
<div n="lb"/>Trailokyamaṅgala’ and taught her how to use them in
<div n="lb"/>worship. Wearing this armour and using the spell she

<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa Paramātmā, for three yugas (world ages). At
<div n="lb"/>the end of this period Śrī Kṛṣṇa Paramātmā appeared
<div n="lb"/>before her and gave her all the boons she wanted. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa said that all over the world she would be worshipp-
<div n="lb"/>ed and that she had power to give boons to her
<div n="lb"/>worshippers.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage and rejection.%} Kaśyapa gave his daughter
<div n="lb"/>Manasādevī in marriage to Jaratkāru, a hermit. As they
<div n="lb"/>were living in the hermitage, once the hermit slept
<div n="lb"/>with his head on the lap of his wife. Seeing the setting
<div n="lb"/>sun she aroused her husband. The hermit became
[Page349-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>angry and decided to reject her. She thought of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas, who instantly arrived. Brahmā argued that it
<div n="lb"/>was not meet and right to reject his wife before a
<div n="lb"/>child was born to her. The hermit touched the groin of
<div n="lb"/>his wife and prayed and with the power of yoga (medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation, contemplation etc.) she became pregnant. The
<div n="lb"/>son born to her is the famous hermit Āstīka.
<div n="NI"/>After giving birth to Āstīka she went to Kailāsa, where
<div n="lb"/>Parameśvara and Pārvatī received her.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The mantra (incantation) of worship.%} To get the
<div n="lb"/>attainment of Manasādevī one has to utter the spell
<div n="lb"/>(mantra) “Oṃ Hrīṃ-Śrīm-Klīṃ-Aiṃ-Manasādevyai
<div n="lb"/>svāhā” five lakh times. He who has got the attainment
<div n="lb"/>of this mantra as given above will be equal to Dhan-
<div n="lb"/>vantari (the physician of the Gods) and to him poison
<div n="lb"/>will be Amṛta (ambrosia). This goddess could be
