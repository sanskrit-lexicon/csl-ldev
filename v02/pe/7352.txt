SUVARṆAṢṬHĪVĪ¦. Son of King Sṛñjaya. While sages
<div n="lb"/>Nārada and Parvata were living in that King's palace
<div n="lb"/>the following incident took place.
<div n="NI"/>Sṛñjaya expressed his sorrow over having no issues to
<div n="lb"/>Nārada who then blessed him to have a son called
<div n="lb"/>Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī. The King began performing Yajñas
<div n="lb"/>from that day onwards and his queen conceived and in
<div n="lb"/>due time delivered a child who was named Suvarṇa-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhīvī and he became an ascetic even as a boy. Indra
<div n="lb"/>got alarmed by the penance of Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī and tried
<div n="lb"/>to frighten him by assuming the forms of various cruel
<div n="lb"/>beasts. He also sent his Vajrāyudha against the ascetic,
<div n="lb"/>but all to no purpose.
<div n="NI"/>The boy became four or five years old when one day
<div n="lb"/>while strolling in the company of his mother on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Gaṅgā, a tiger jumped upon him. This
<div n="lb"/>tiger of illusion had been sent by Indra and the tiger
<div n="lb"/>killed the boy. His mother wept aloud and people in
<div n="lb"/>the palace gathered around her. Sṛñjaya wept bitterly.
<div n="lb"/>Ultimately Nārada appeared, consoled the King and
<div n="lb"/>with the permission of Indra brought the boy back to
<div n="lb"/>life. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 31; also see under Sṛñjaya)
