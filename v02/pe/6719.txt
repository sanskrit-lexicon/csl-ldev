SRĀVAŚAUCA¦. Defilement attached to the flux due to
abortion. It is ordered in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 258,
how to observe this defilement. It is said that women
should observe defilement for as many nights as the
number of the months of pregnancy, till the flux. If the
flux took place in the fourth month, defilement should
be observed for three nights. If it was in the fifth
month that the flux had occurred, pollution for ten
days would have to be observed. This is meant for
Brahmins. In the case of a Kṣatriya woman if the
flux occurred in the fifth month, she has to observe
defilement for four days; and five days for a Vaiśya
woman, and eight days for a Śūdra woman. In the
case of a Śūdra woman, if the flux is after five months,
she has to observe pollution for twelve days. In this
stage the father will be purified by a bath.
