BUDDHISM¦. (BUDDHA-MATA). The origin of Bud-
dhism was in the sixth century B.C. This new religion
was shaped out of Hinduism that prevailed at that
time. Buddhism which had its origin in North India,
prevailed everywhere in India up to the eleventh
[Page166-a+ 65]
century A.D. During that period there was an over-
flow of this religion to the other parts of Asia. Now
this religion has its full sway over the people of Burma.
90% of the population there, are adherents of Bud-
dhism. 80% of the people of Thailand, 60% of the
people in Ceylon and Japan and 17% in China are
now Buddhists. In India, Pakistan and the Philippines
the Buddhists are only a minority. Even though Indo-
nesia is a Muslim country there is a small class of
Buddhists there. Combodia, Lavos and Tibet are consi-
dered to be Buddhist countries. In Nepal there are
only two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. In count-
ries outside Asia there are followers of Buddhism.
Statistics reveal that there are one hundred and sixty-
five thousand Buddhists in North America, one
hundred and thirtyfive thousand in South America,
and ten thousand in Europe. The number of Buddhists
in the world today is 150.31 crores.
