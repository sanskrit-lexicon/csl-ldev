VASU¦ XI. A King. He was born to Uttānapāda by
Sūnṛtā. A controversy arose among hermits once, about
cow-sacrifice and for a solution of the problem the
hermits approached this king Vasu, who told them his
perception that the sacrifice of cow was, strictly speak-
ing, a matter of slaughter and as such it was to be for-
bidden. As the hermits could not agree with the King,
they cursed him “Let the King go to Pātāla (under-
world). Vasu then did very severe penance and attained
heaven. (Matsya Purāṇa, 143, 18-25).
