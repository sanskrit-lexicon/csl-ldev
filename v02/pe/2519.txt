GṚTSAMADA III¦. The son born to Indra of Mukundā.
<div n="lb"/>There is the following story about him in Gaṇeśa
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Rukmāṅgada was out from the palace,
<div n="lb"/>Indra, in the guise of Rukmāṅgada, went to
<div n="lb"/>Mukundā, wife of Rukmāṅgada, and slept with
<div n="lb"/>her who was at that time sexually hungry. She delivered
<div n="lb"/>a child in due course. This boy was Gṛtsamada. He
<div n="lb"/>grew into a great scholar. Nobody was able to defeat
<div n="lb"/>him in any verbal duel. Once Gṛtsamada went to the
<div n="lb"/>palace of the king of Magadha to attend a Śrāddha (an
<div n="lb"/>offering to the manes) along with Vasiṣṭha and others.
<div n="lb"/>Atri Maharṣi who was present there then spoke sligh-
<div n="lb"/>tingly of Gṛtsamada's parentage and Gṛtsamada coming
<div n="lb"/>home questioned his mother. The mother then told him
<div n="lb"/>what had happened and Gṛtsamada getting angry at the
<div n="lb"/>immoral act committed by his mother cursed her and
<div n="lb"/>said “May you be a Kaṇṭaka tree”. Mukundā also did
<div n="lb"/>not leave her son free. She cursed him thus “You will
<div n="lb"/>have a demon as your son”. But Gṛtsamada went and
<div n="lb"/>did penance to propitiate Gaṇapati and got Brāhmaṇya.
