ŚĪLAVATĪ¦. A heroine reputed for her chastity and
fidelity to her husband. Her husband, Ugraśravas was
cruel and vicious. Yet Śīlavatī used to adore him. Once
Ugraśravas fell a victim to the disease of leprosy. From
that time, Śīlavatī used to go about begging in the
houses of Brāhmaṇas to feed and support her husband.
After some time by her constant nursing, his condition
was slightly improved. After that she continued her
begging from door to door, carrying him on her shoulders.
Once they happened to arrive in front of a huge man-
sion. Water was flowing in front of the gate and so
Śīlavatī returned from there with her husband without
stepping into the water. When they reached home,
Ugraśravas asked his wife why she returned without
entering the mansion. She explained that it was the
house of a prostitute and to touch the water coming out
of that house was sin. On hearing it, Ugraśravas felt
an irresistible desire to visit that brothel. He expressed
his desire to her. Quite obediently Śīlavatī took up her
husband on her shoulders and went to the prostitute's
house. (For more details see under Aṇī māṇḍavya,
Anasūyā and Atri).
