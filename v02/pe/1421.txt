CAṆḌAKA¦. A forest hunter who attained salvation by
<div n="lb"/>the worship of Śivaliṅga. (Phallus of Śiva).
<div n="NI"/>While once hunting in the woods Caṇḍaka saw a Śiva
<div n="lb"/>temple in ruins, and the Śivaliṅga lying on the ground
<div n="lb"/>uncared for. This sight greatly grieved him, and he
<div n="lb"/>told Śiṃhaketu, son of the Pāñcāla Rāja who happened
<div n="lb"/>to come that way all about the temple and the
<div n="lb"/>liṅga. To his query as to whether the śāstra permitted
<div n="lb"/>a hunter like himself to worship Śivaliṅga, Siṃhaketu
<div n="lb"/>answered there were injunctions in the Śāstras for
<div n="lb"/>people like him (Caṇḍakas) to instal Śivaliṅga on
<div n="lb"/>rock and then worship it daily, the worshipper wear-
<div n="lb"/>ing ashes from the burning ghāṭ on his body. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly Caṇḍaka installed the liṅga on a rock and began
<div n="lb"/>worshipping it daily along with his wife, Pulindī. But
<div n="lb"/>after sometime there was left no ashes in the burning
<div n="lb"/>ghāṭ and Caṇḍaka and Pulindī discussed between them
<div n="lb"/>the means to get ashes for the next day. Then Pulindī
<div n="lb"/>suggested that she should burn herself to ashes and that
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍaka should continue worshipping the Śivaliṅga
<div n="lb"/>wearing on his body the ashes. Very unwillingly
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍaka agreed with the sad proposal of his wife, and
<div n="lb"/>the next day he worshipped the Śivaliṅga wearing on
<div n="lb"/>his body the ashes of Pulindī. And, at the close of the
<div n="lb"/>worship he called aloud for Pulindī, and lo! wonder
<div n="lb"/>of wonders! she stood there before him more healthy
<div n="lb"/>than formerly. Moreover a vimāna descended from the
<div n="lb"/>skies and conducted both Caṇḍaka and Pulindī to
<div n="lb"/>Śivaloka. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śaṃbaramāhātyma).
