LAKṢMĪDĀSA¦. A Sanskrit poet who was the author
<div n="lb"/>of Śukasandeśa.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Birth.%} He was born in the former state of Cochin in
<div n="lb"/>Kariṅgāmpilly Mana. This Mana (house) was near the
<div n="lb"/>temple of Tṛppūtamaṅgala in Vellārappilly in Cochin
<div n="lb"/>(Kaṇayannūr taluk). The Kariṅgāmpilly Mana was
<div n="lb"/>bearing the position of Taliyātiri in the village of Irāṇik-
<div n="lb"/>kula. It is over two hundred years since that Mana
<div n="lb"/>became extinct. (The houses of Namboothiri brahmins
<div n="lb"/>are called Manas).
<div n="NI"/>2) It is believed that the famous ‘Śukasandeśa’ was
<div n="lb"/>written in 112 M.E. There is one set of historians
<div n="lb"/>who hold that it was written in 666 A.D. But the fam-
<div n="lb"/>ous scholar and poet Ullūr states with authority that
<div n="lb"/>it was written in the 10th or 11th century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Stories about this poet.%} As usual there are legends
<div n="lb"/>regarding this poet also. That the poet was a very
<div n="lb"/>dull boy in his childhood and that he became bright
<div n="lb"/>and brilliant by the blessings of his guru is one legend.
<div n="lb"/>After writing his Śukasandeśa the poet went on a
<div n="lb"/>pilgrimage in South India. One night he came to a
<div n="lb"/>brahmin's house but was not given any food or a place
<div n="lb"/>to sleep. He slept in an open veranda on the outside.
<div n="lb"/>He was lying awake when he heard his ‘Śukasandeśa’
<div n="lb"/>being read inside by a few people. At a stage they were
<div n="lb"/>not able to follow the import of a verse when Lakṣmī-
<div n="lb"/>dāsa shouted the meaning from outside. A door
<div n="lb"/>opened and a voice enquired in Tamil “Are you
<div n="lb"/>Kariṅgāmpilly?” When he said yes they were extremely
<div n="lb"/>happy and took him inside and treated him with
<div n="lb"/>respect.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Works.%} No major work other then Śukasandeśa has
<div n="lb"/>been found. Two small poems are available.
<div n="NI"/>Śukasandeśa has been written on the model of the
<div n="lb"/>famous Meghasandeśa of Kālidāsa. Many commentaries
<div n="lb"/>on this have come to light; of these the one written by
[Page450-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Mānavedan Rāja of Kozhikode Palace named Vilāsinī
<div n="lb"/>is the best. Other commentaries named Varavarṇinī,
<div n="lb"/>Cintātilaka and Vyākṛti are also worth mentioning.
