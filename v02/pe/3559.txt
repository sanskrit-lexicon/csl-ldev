KĪRTIMĀN I¦. The first son born to Vasudeva and
Devakī. As a celestial voice had warned Kaṃsa that
the eighth son of Devakī would kill him he had ordered
that every child born to her should be taken to him.
Accordingly the first-born son of Devakī was taken to
him, but was returned to the parents as Kaṃsa thought
[Page413-a+ 65]
that he was not his enemy. He was brought up under
the name Kīrtimān. Afterwards Nārada visited Kaṃsa
and explained to him about his former birth, the
object of Kṛṣṇa's incarnation etc. This information so
angered Kaṃsa that he got Vasudeva and Devakī
chained in prison. Moreover he brought back the
first-born son of Devakī and dashed him to death on
a stone. Thus ended the life of Kīrtimān.
