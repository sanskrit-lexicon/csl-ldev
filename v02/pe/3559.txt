KĪRTIMĀN I¦. The first son born to Vasudeva and
<div n="lb"/>Devakī. As a celestial voice had warned Kaṃsa that
<div n="lb"/>the eighth son of Devakī would kill him he had ordered
<div n="lb"/>that every child born to her should be taken to him.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly the first-born son of Devakī was taken to
<div n="lb"/>him, but was returned to the parents as Kaṃsa thought
[Page413-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>that he was not his enemy. He was brought up under
<div n="lb"/>the name Kīrtimān. Afterwards Nārada visited Kaṃsa
<div n="lb"/>and explained to him about his former birth, the
<div n="lb"/>object of Kṛṣṇa's incarnation etc. This information so
<div n="lb"/>angered Kaṃsa that he got Vasudeva and Devakī
<div n="lb"/>chained in prison. Moreover he brought back the
<div n="lb"/>first-born son of Devakī and dashed him to death on
<div n="lb"/>a stone. Thus ended the life of Kīrtimān.
