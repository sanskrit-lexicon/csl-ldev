MĀLYAVĀN I¦. A Pārṣada of Śiva. The most intimate
<div n="lb"/>friend of Mālyavān was Puṣpadanta.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Curse of Mālyavān.%} Once Śiva was telling Pārvatī a
<div n="lb"/>story of the Gandharvas and Puṣpadanta heard it as he
<div n="lb"/>sat hiding in a place nearby. Pārvatī got angry and
<div n="lb"/>was about to curse when Mālyavān intervened and re-
<div n="lb"/>commended for mercy. Pārvatī got angrier and cursed
<div n="lb"/>them both to be born on earth as men. They begged
<div n="lb"/>for relief and Pārvatī said: “In the deep depths of the
<div n="lb"/>forest of Vindhya mountains there lives a Yakṣa named
<div n="lb"/>Supratīka who has been turned into a devil called
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇabhūti by a curse. Puṣpadanta should narrate the
<div n="lb"/>story he has now heard to Kāṇabhūti and he will then
<div n="lb"/>be released from the curse. Kāṇabhūti would narrate to
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān what he has heard from Puṣpadanta and
[Page473-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇabhūti would then be released from his curse.
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān should then make public the story he has
<div n="lb"/>heard and then he will also be released from the curse”.
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpadanta was born as Vararuci in the city of Kau-
<div n="lb"/>śāmbī and Mālyavān as Guṇāḍhya in the city of
<div n="lb"/>Supratiṣṭhita. (See under Guṇāḍhya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Another curse to Mālyavān.%} By another curse Mālya-
<div n="lb"/>vān was born as a spider and Puṣpadanta as an elephant
<div n="lb"/>in the south of Bhārata. (See under Puṣpadanta)
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Part in Devāsura battle.%} Released from curses Mālyavān
<div n="lb"/>reached the presence of Śiva. It was the time of the
<div n="lb"/>Devāsura battle and Mālyavān fought on the side of
<div n="lb"/>the devas. Mālyavān played a prominent part in the
<div n="lb"/>battle. Mālyavān had to fight against a fierce archer
<div n="lb"/>named Kolāhala. Kolāhala sent three arrows one each
<div n="lb"/>on the forehead and the two shoulders. Mālyavān
<div n="lb"/>returned the fight with arrows. Then Kolāhala showing
<div n="lb"/>his swiftness of hand tormented him with several
<div n="lb"/>different weapons. Unmindful of this vehement attack
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān plucked a hillock and threw it at Kolāhala.
<div n="NI"/>Then suddenly a fierce figure blazing with fire having
<div n="lb"/>nine pairs of hands and feet and three heads looking
<div n="lb"/>yellow in colour jumped out of the demon and made
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān faint by the terrible heat it gave out.
<div n="lb"/>Mālyavān accepted defeat and ran away to the mountain.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 13, Part 4, Agni Purāṇa).
