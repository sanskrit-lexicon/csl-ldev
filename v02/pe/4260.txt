MĀLYAVĀN I¦. A Pārṣada of Śiva. The most intimate
friend of Mālyavān was Puṣpadanta.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Curse of Mālyavān.%} Once Śiva was telling Pārvatī a
story of the Gandharvas and Puṣpadanta heard it as he
sat hiding in a place nearby. Pārvatī got angry and
was about to curse when Mālyavān intervened and re-
commended for mercy. Pārvatī got angrier and cursed
them both to be born on earth as men. They begged
for relief and Pārvatī said: “In the deep depths of the
forest of Vindhya mountains there lives a Yakṣa named
Supratīka who has been turned into a devil called
Kāṇabhūti by a curse. Puṣpadanta should narrate the
story he has now heard to Kāṇabhūti and he will then
be released from the curse. Kāṇabhūti would narrate to
Mālyavān what he has heard from Puṣpadanta and
[Page473-a+ 65]
Kāṇabhūti would then be released from his curse.
Mālyavān should then make public the story he has
heard and then he will also be released from the curse”.
Puṣpadanta was born as Vararuci in the city of Kau-
śāmbī and Mālyavān as Guṇāḍhya in the city of
Supratiṣṭhita. (See under Guṇāḍhya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Another curse to Mālyavān.%} By another curse Mālya-
vān was born as a spider and Puṣpadanta as an elephant
in the south of Bhārata. (See under Puṣpadanta)
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Part in Devāsura battle.%} Released from curses Mālyavān
reached the presence of Śiva. It was the time of the
Devāsura battle and Mālyavān fought on the side of
the devas. Mālyavān played a prominent part in the
battle. Mālyavān had to fight against a fierce archer
named Kolāhala. Kolāhala sent three arrows one each
on the forehead and the two shoulders. Mālyavān
returned the fight with arrows. Then Kolāhala showing
his swiftness of hand tormented him with several
different weapons. Unmindful of this vehement attack
Mālyavān plucked a hillock and threw it at Kolāhala.
<div n="NI"/>Then suddenly a fierce figure blazing with fire having
nine pairs of hands and feet and three heads looking
yellow in colour jumped out of the demon and made
Mālyavān faint by the terrible heat it gave out.
Mālyavān accepted defeat and ran away to the mountain.
(Chapter 13, Part 4, Agni Purāṇa).
