BUDHA I¦. Son of Candra.
<div n="NI"/>1) Birth. Bṛhaspati the teacher-priest of the devas
<div n="lb"/>had a very beautiful wife named Tārā. One day seeing
<div n="lb"/>the handsome figure of Candra, Tārā became amorous.
<div n="lb"/>Candra was the Disciple of Bṛhaspati. It was not right
<div n="lb"/>on the part of the wife of the teacher to feel amorous
<div n="lb"/>towards a disciple. Bṛhaspati came to know of the
<div n="lb"/>affair and sending for Candra asked him to return his
<div n="lb"/>wife. Both Candra and Tārā did not pay any heed to
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati. Both sides were about to engage in a battle.
<div n="lb"/>The devas arrayed themselves on both sides. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>that this was not an honourable thing some devas
<div n="lb"/>tried for a compromise. Finally Candra returned Tārā
<div n="lb"/>to Bṛhaspati. At this time Tārā was pregnant. Both
<div n="lb"/>Candra and Bṛhaspati claimed the paternity of the
<div n="lb"/>child in the womb of Tārā, who witnessed that Candra
[Page165-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was the father of the child. All accepted the words of
<div n="lb"/>Tārā. Budha was the child Tārā gave birth to.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage and birth of a child.%} Budha grew up to be
<div n="lb"/>a youth. During the period the King Sudyumna one
<div n="lb"/>day entered Kumāravana (a forest) and was changed to
<div n="lb"/>a woman. When the King became a woman the name
<div n="lb"/>adopted was Ilā, who grew amorous of Budha. The
<div n="lb"/>famous King Purūravas was the son born to them.
<div n="lb"/>(For more information see Ilā, Candra and Purū-
<div n="lb"/>ravas).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other information%}
