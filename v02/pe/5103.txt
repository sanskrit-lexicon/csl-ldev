PATINEṬṬARAKKAVI¦(S). (Eighteen and a half wise
<div n="lb"/>men).
<div n="NI"/>Mānavikrama, the zamorin who ruled the old state of
<div n="lb"/>Kozhikkoṭu in the beginning of the seventh century
<div n="lb"/>(Malayālam Era) was a talented man well-versed in
<div n="lb"/>all arts. He kept in his court a company of nineteen
<div n="lb"/>wise men whom he called by the well-known name
<div n="lb"/>Patineṭṭarakkavis meaning eighteen and a half kavis.
<div n="lb"/>The kavis of the zamorin were the nine Paṭṭeris of
<div n="lb"/>Payyūr, the five Nambūtiris of Tiruvegappura,
<div n="lb"/>Mullappilly Nambūtiri, Uddaṇḍaśāstri, Kākkaśśeri
<div n="lb"/>Bhaṭṭatiri, Cennās Nambūtirippāḍu and Punam
<div n="lb"/>Nambūtiri. Of these eighteen were scholars in Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>and the nineteenth, Punam Nambūtiri was a vernacular
<div n="lb"/>poet and so the then zamorin gave only half a unit
<div n="lb"/>value to the vernacular member and thus named the
<div n="lb"/>assembly as a company of eighteen and a half members.
<div n="lb"/>There is another explanation given to the word
<div n="lb"/>‘arakkavi’. ‘Ara’ means ‘half; but modern pandits say
<div n="lb"/>that ‘ara’ was a prefix to show a sign of royalty as is
<div n="lb"/>found in the words ‘aramana’ meaning royal mana or
<div n="lb"/>palace of the King. Śo ‘arakkavi’ would mean a Kavi
<div n="lb"/>attached to a King. Then the question comes, which
<div n="lb"/>of the nineteen was not included in the original com-
<div n="lb"/>pany to reduce the number to eighteen. We can leave
<div n="lb"/>the matter for further research.
<div n="NI"/>Payyūr Accan Bhaṭṭatirippāḍu, the top-most of Kerala
<div n="lb"/>pandits, was the president of the council of Patineṭṭarak-
<div n="lb"/>kavis. The illam (house) of this Bhaṭṭatirippāḍu
<div n="lb"/>belonged to the Kunnamkulam taluk near Guruvāyūr
<div n="lb"/>of Cochin state. He was known as Maharṣi also
<div n="lb"/>Uddaṇḍaśāstrikal in his Mallikāmāruta states that one
<div n="lb"/>of the Paṭṭeris was Payyūr Mahābhaṭṭatirippāḍu named
<div n="lb"/>Parameśvara. Uddaṇḍaśāstri belonged to Kāñcīpura.
<div n="lb"/>Kākkaśśeri Bhaṭṭatiri was born to defeat the invincible
<div n="lb"/>Uddaṇḍaśāstri. Cennās Nambūtiri was the author of
<div n="lb"/>Tantraṣamuccaya. Many poets and pandits were born
<div n="lb"/>in the family of these Kavis after their death.
