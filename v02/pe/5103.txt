PATINEṬṬARAKKAVI¦(S). (Eighteen and a half wise
men).
<div n="NI"/>Mānavikrama, the zamorin who ruled the old state of
Kozhikkoṭu in the beginning of the seventh century
(Malayālam Era) was a talented man well-versed in
all arts. He kept in his court a company of nineteen
wise men whom he called by the well-known name
Patineṭṭarakkavis meaning eighteen and a half kavis.
The kavis of the zamorin were the nine Paṭṭeris of
Payyūr, the five Nambūtiris of Tiruvegappura,
Mullappilly Nambūtiri, Uddaṇḍaśāstri, Kākkaśśeri
Bhaṭṭatiri, Cennās Nambūtirippāḍu and Punam
Nambūtiri. Of these eighteen were scholars in Sanskrit
and the nineteenth, Punam Nambūtiri was a vernacular
poet and so the then zamorin gave only half a unit
value to the vernacular member and thus named the
assembly as a company of eighteen and a half members.
There is another explanation given to the word
‘arakkavi’. ‘Ara’ means ‘half; but modern pandits say
that ‘ara’ was a prefix to show a sign of royalty as is
found in the words ‘aramana’ meaning royal mana or
palace of the King. Śo ‘arakkavi’ would mean a Kavi
attached to a King. Then the question comes, which
of the nineteen was not included in the original com-
pany to reduce the number to eighteen. We can leave
the matter for further research.
<div n="NI"/>Payyūr Accan Bhaṭṭatirippāḍu, the top-most of Kerala
pandits, was the president of the council of Patineṭṭarak-
kavis. The illam (house) of this Bhaṭṭatirippāḍu
belonged to the Kunnamkulam taluk near Guruvāyūr
of Cochin state. He was known as Maharṣi also
Uddaṇḍaśāstrikal in his Mallikāmāruta states that one
of the Paṭṭeris was Payyūr Mahābhaṭṭatirippāḍu named
Parameśvara. Uddaṇḍaśāstri belonged to Kāñcīpura.
Kākkaśśeri Bhaṭṭatiri was born to defeat the invincible
Uddaṇḍaśāstri. Cennās Nambūtiri was the author of
Tantraṣamuccaya. Many poets and pandits were born
in the family of these Kavis after their death.
