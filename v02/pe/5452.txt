PŪJANĪ¦. A bird of superior intellect. The story of
Pūjanī was told by Bhīṣma to illustrate that Kṣatriyas
can never be believed.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a king called Brahmadatta in the coun-
try of Kāmpilya. The King had a bird named Pūjanī.
Pūjanī was very intelligent and all-knowing and the king
treated her as his friend. Days went by and one day the
queen delivered a son. At the same time Pūjanī also
got a child. The prince and the little bird grew up as
great friends. The little bird used to bring to the prince
whatever eatable it could take in its little beak. They lived
as such thick chums.
<div n="NI"/>One day while Pūjanī was away from the cage, the
prince caught hold of the little bird and strangled it
to death. When Pūjanī came back she found her child
missing and went about crying loudly. She then knew
what had happened and got very angry. She flew and
pricked blind the eyes of the prince and bade farewell
to the King. The parting scene was very pathetic.
Pūjanī declared that Kṣatriyas were not to be believed
and flew away. (Chapter 139, Śānti Parva).
