PŪJANĪ¦. A bird of superior intellect. The story of
<div n="lb"/>Pūjanī was told by Bhīṣma to illustrate that Kṣatriyas
<div n="lb"/>can never be believed.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a king called Brahmadatta in the coun-
<div n="lb"/>try of Kāmpilya. The King had a bird named Pūjanī.
<div n="lb"/>Pūjanī was very intelligent and all-knowing and the king
<div n="lb"/>treated her as his friend. Days went by and one day the
<div n="lb"/>queen delivered a son. At the same time Pūjanī also
<div n="lb"/>got a child. The prince and the little bird grew up as
<div n="lb"/>great friends. The little bird used to bring to the prince
<div n="lb"/>whatever eatable it could take in its little beak. They lived
<div n="lb"/>as such thick chums.
<div n="NI"/>One day while Pūjanī was away from the cage, the
<div n="lb"/>prince caught hold of the little bird and strangled it
<div n="lb"/>to death. When Pūjanī came back she found her child
<div n="lb"/>missing and went about crying loudly. She then knew
<div n="lb"/>what had happened and got very angry. She flew and
<div n="lb"/>pricked blind the eyes of the prince and bade farewell
<div n="lb"/>to the King. The parting scene was very pathetic.
<div n="lb"/>Pūjanī declared that Kṣatriyas were not to be believed
<div n="lb"/>and flew away. (Chapter 139, Śānti Parva).
