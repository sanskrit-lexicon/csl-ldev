DHRUVA¦. I.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and childhood.%} Manu Svāyambhuva the son of
Brahmā, had two sons named Priyavrata and Uttāna-
pāda. They were mighty heroes and of righteous
character. Uttānapāda had two wives, Suruci and
Sunīti. Suruci gave birth to Uttama and Sunīti to
Dhruva. Uttānapāda showed more favour towards
Uttama and Suruci. But he looked upon Dhruva and
his mother with disfavour.
<div n="NI"/>Once Uttama sat on the lap of his father when the
latter was sitting on the throne. Seeing this, Dhruva
wanted to sit along with his brother. But fearing the
displeasure of Suruci, who was also there, the King did
not take Dhruva on to his lap. Seeing the endeavour of
Dhruva, Suruci said to him, “Child, if you wish to sit
on the lap of your father, you ought to have been born
in my womb. You cherish high ambition which you do
not deserve.” These words of Suruci were not palatable
to Dhruva who ran to his mother and sat on her lap.
When Sunīti knew what had happened she shed tears.
After a few moments Dhruva stood up and made a
vow. “I will get a position unattainable even for my
[Page238-b+ 65]
father, by my own endeavour.” He then started for the
forest. He attained self-renunciation even in childhood
becoming a disciple of hermits and performing severe
penance.
<div n="NI"/>Dhruva began penance in the forest of Madhuvana on
the river Jamunā. Sunīti came and tried to take him to
the palace. But he did not return. He intensified his pena-
nce more and more. At last Mahāviṣṇu appeared before
him. Dhruva requested for a lofty, and eternal place
which would become a prop of the world. Accordingly,
Viṣṇu pointed out to Dhruva, a noble place, higher
than the planets, stars Saptarṣis (Ursa Major) and the
devas who travelled in aeroplanes. Mahāviṣṇu said
that Dhruva would live in a lofty place as a star till
the end of the Kalpa and his mother Sunīti would also
remain as a star near Śiva as long as Dhruva lived
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapters 11 and 12).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The previous birth of Dhruva.%} Mahāviṣṇu appeared
before Dhruva and revealed his previous birth.
<div n="NI"/>Dhruva was a Brahmin in his previous birth. He used
to meditate on Viṣṇu with concentration of mind. In
course of time he befriended a prince who was a youth,
of beautiful and bright complexion, enjoying all the
pleasures of the world. Attracted by the position and
status of the prince, the Brahmin wanted to become a
prince. Mahāviṣṇu granted his wish. Accordingly
Dhruva took his next birth as the son of Uttānapāda.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The reign and end of Dhruva.%} After receiving the boon
from Mahāviṣṇu, Dhruva returned. All who were there
embraced Dhruva. Years passed by. Uttānapāda left
his kingdom to Dhruva and became a forest house-
holder. Dhruva became King. The King Dhruva
married Brāhmī, the daughter of Śiśumāra a Prajāpati.
The queen gave birth to two sons Kalpa and Vatsara.
Dhruva married Ilā the daughter of Vāyu (wind). She
gave birth to a son named Utkala.
<div n="NI"/>Uttama remained unmarried. While he was hunting in
the forest a Yakṣa (a demi-god) killed him. Suruci was
caught in wild fire and died. Hearing about the death
of Uttama, Dhruva took his weapons and reached the
realm of the Yakṣas. He stood at their gate and
challenged them for battle. One lac and thirty thousand
Yakṣa warriors fought with Dhruva. Dhruva destroyed
the entire army. The Yakṣas began illusive and
magical arts. Dhruva overcame that also. At last
Kubera himself appeared before Dhruva and blessed
him. They got him into a plane and placed him in a
place higher than all the planets. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The descendants of Dhruva.%} Two sons named Śiṣṭi and
Bhavya were born to Dhruva by his wife Śambhu.
Succhāyā the wife of Śiṣṭi gave birth to five sinless sons
named Ripu, Ripuñjaya, Vipra, Vṛkala and Vṛkatejas.
Bṛhatī the wife of Ripu gave birth to Cākṣuṣa of extreme
bright complexion. Manu was born to Cākṣuṣa by his
wife Puṣkaraṇī the daughter of Vīraṇaprajāpati and in-
cluded in the children of Varuṇa. Ten sons were born
to the bright Manu by his wife Naḍvalā, daughter
of Prajāpati Vairāja. These ten bright sons were Kuru,
Pūru, Śatadyumna Tapasvī, Satyavān, Śuci, Agniṣ-
ṭomā, Atirātra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. Āgneyī,
the wife of Kuru gave birth to six children.
They were Aṅga, Sumanas, Khyāti, Kratu, Aṅgiras
and Śibi. A son named Vena was born to Aṅga
[Page239-a+ 63]
by his wife Sunīthā. Hermits churned the right hand
of Vena to obtain children. As a result of churning
Vaineya was born from the right hand of Vena. That
King is the famous Pṛthu. This Pṛthu milked the earth
for the prosperity of his subjects. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa
1, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The place of Dhruva.%} The origin of the river Gaṅgā
was through the hole at the top of the shell of the
mundane egg. It flowed down and fell on the highest
part of heaven. That place is called Viṣṇupāda. Sitting
in this Viṣṇupāda, Dhruva does penance to Viṣṇu. So
this place got the name Dhruvamaṇḍala. (Devī Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 8).
