GAUTAMA¦ 1
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General Information.%} The Purāṇas record about a
<div n="lb"/>sage called Gautama though nothing is known about
<div n="lb"/>his genealogy. Yet the genealogy of his wife Ahalyā is
<div n="lb"/>available. See under ‘Ahalyā’.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Sons of Gautama.%} The eldest son of Gautama was
<div n="lb"/>Śatānanda. (Śloka 2, Sarga, 51, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa). Gautama had two sons. Śaradvān and
<div n="lb"/>Cirakārī. Śaradvān was born with arrows in his hand.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 2, Chapter 130, Ādi Parva). Cirakārī used to
<div n="lb"/>ponder over everything before he acted and so all his
<div n="lb"/>actions were delayed. He got his name Cirakārī.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 266, Sabhā Parva). Śaradvān was known as
<div n="lb"/>Gautama also. That was why Kṛpa and Kṛpī, children
<div n="lb"/>of Śaradvān were known as Gautama and Gautamī.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 2, Chapter 129, Ādi Parva). Besides these,
<div n="lb"/>Gautama had a daughter of unknown name. There is
<div n="lb"/>a reference to this girl in śloka 11 of Chapter 56 of
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha Parva. It is reported that this daughter
<div n="lb"/>wept when Utaṅga a disciple of Gautama came to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama with a huge load of firewood on his head. In
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 4, of Vāmana Purāṇa there is a reference to a
<div n="lb"/>few other daughters of Gautama, namely, Jayā, Jayantī
<div n="lb"/>and Aparājī.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%An attempt to kill Ahalyā.%} Once when Gautama was
<div n="lb"/>away from the āśrama Indra came there as a guest.
<div n="lb"/>Considering it as her duty to treat a guest of her
<div n="lb"/>husband properly during his absence Ahalyā received
<div n="lb"/>him well and gave him fruit to ease his tiredness.
<div n="lb"/>Indra went back. Gautama on knowing this on his
<div n="lb"/>return suspected the chastity of his wife and calling
<div n="lb"/>his son Cirakārī to his side asked him to cut off her
<div n="lb"/>head. After giving the order Gautama went to the
<div n="lb"/>forests.
<div n="NI"/>Cirakārī had a peculiar nature. He will ponder over
<div n="lb"/>things deeply before taking any action. He knew he must
<div n="lb"/>obey the orders of his father but killing one's own
<div n="lb"/>mother was a greater sin than disobeying a father.
<div n="lb"/>Weighing the merits and demerits of the act Cirakārī
<div n="lb"/>sat thinking without doing anything.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama when he reached the forest thought again
<div n="lb"/>about Ahalyā and her crime. After all what has she
<div n="lb"/>done? A guest came to the āśrama and as duty bound
<div n="lb"/>she welcomed him. It was indeed a great sin to have
<div n="lb"/>killed her by her own son. Immersed in thoughts of
<div n="lb"/>this kind, sad and repentant, Gautama returned to the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama to find Cirakārī sitting silently deeply engross-
<div n="lb"/>ed in thoughts. On seeing his father Cirakārī was
<div n="lb"/>perplexed and he explained to his father about the good
[Page286-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and bad effects of his order. Gautama was pleased at
<div n="lb"/>this and he blessed him with long life.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How the disciple Utaṅga was tested.%} Utaṅga was the
<div n="lb"/>best of the disciples of Gautama. So even when all
<div n="lb"/>the other disciples were sent away Gautama asked
<div n="lb"/>Utaṅga to continue as a disciple which Utaṅga did
<div n="lb"/>most willingly. The disciple became old with grey
<div n="lb"/>hairs. Then taking pity on him Gautama received
<div n="lb"/>gurudakṣiṇā from Utaṅga and sent him away with
<div n="lb"/>blessings. (For details see under ‘Utaṅga’).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Curse of Ahalyā.%} Indra became a lover of Ahalyā
<div n="lb"/>and slept with her. Gautama coming to know of that
<div n="lb"/>cursed both Indra and Ahalyā. (For details see under
<div n="lb"/>Ahalyā).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details regarding Gautama.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kalmāṣapāda, King of Ayodhyā. lived for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years as a demon following a curse of Vasiṣṭha. At
