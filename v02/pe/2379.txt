GAUTAMA¦ 1
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General Information.%} The Purāṇas record about a
sage called Gautama though nothing is known about
his genealogy. Yet the genealogy of his wife Ahalyā is
available. See under ‘Ahalyā’.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Sons of Gautama.%} The eldest son of Gautama was
Śatānanda. (Śloka 2, Sarga, 51, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa). Gautama had two sons. Śaradvān and
Cirakārī. Śaradvān was born with arrows in his hand.
(Śloka 2, Chapter 130, Ādi Parva). Cirakārī used to
ponder over everything before he acted and so all his
actions were delayed. He got his name Cirakārī.
(Chapter 266, Sabhā Parva). Śaradvān was known as
Gautama also. That was why Kṛpa and Kṛpī, children
of Śaradvān were known as Gautama and Gautamī.
(Śloka 2, Chapter 129, Ādi Parva). Besides these,
Gautama had a daughter of unknown name. There is
a reference to this girl in śloka 11 of Chapter 56 of
Aśvamedha Parva. It is reported that this daughter
wept when Utaṅga a disciple of Gautama came to the
āśrama with a huge load of firewood on his head. In
Chapter 4, of Vāmana Purāṇa there is a reference to a
few other daughters of Gautama, namely, Jayā, Jayantī
and Aparājī.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%An attempt to kill Ahalyā.%} Once when Gautama was
away from the āśrama Indra came there as a guest.
Considering it as her duty to treat a guest of her
husband properly during his absence Ahalyā received
him well and gave him fruit to ease his tiredness.
Indra went back. Gautama on knowing this on his
return suspected the chastity of his wife and calling
his son Cirakārī to his side asked him to cut off her
head. After giving the order Gautama went to the
forests.
<div n="NI"/>Cirakārī had a peculiar nature. He will ponder over
things deeply before taking any action. He knew he must
obey the orders of his father but killing one's own
mother was a greater sin than disobeying a father.
Weighing the merits and demerits of the act Cirakārī
sat thinking without doing anything.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama when he reached the forest thought again
about Ahalyā and her crime. After all what has she
done? A guest came to the āśrama and as duty bound
she welcomed him. It was indeed a great sin to have
killed her by her own son. Immersed in thoughts of
this kind, sad and repentant, Gautama returned to the
āśrama to find Cirakārī sitting silently deeply engross-
ed in thoughts. On seeing his father Cirakārī was
perplexed and he explained to his father about the good
[Page286-a+ 64]
and bad effects of his order. Gautama was pleased at
this and he blessed him with long life.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How the disciple Utaṅga was tested.%} Utaṅga was the
best of the disciples of Gautama. So even when all
the other disciples were sent away Gautama asked
Utaṅga to continue as a disciple which Utaṅga did
most willingly. The disciple became old with grey
hairs. Then taking pity on him Gautama received
gurudakṣiṇā from Utaṅga and sent him away with
blessings. (For details see under ‘Utaṅga’).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Curse of Ahalyā.%} Indra became a lover of Ahalyā
and slept with her. Gautama coming to know of that
cursed both Indra and Ahalyā. (For details see under
Ahalyā).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details regarding Gautama.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kalmāṣapāda, King of Ayodhyā. lived for twelve
years as a demon following a curse of Vasiṣṭha. At
last he took refuge in Gautama and following his
advice went to Gokarṇa and doing penance there to
propitiate Śiva attained mokṣa. (Śivarātri Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) It was sage Nodhas, alias Gautama, who composed
