YAŚAS¦. Father of Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Mahā-
viṣṇu. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 16, mentions that towards
the end of Kaliyuga all people will become atheists,
there will be an intermixture of castes and all people
will become thieves and devoid of virtue. At that time,
the 15 branches of the Veda called Vājasaneyas alone
will be the authority. Mlecchas (low-class people)
assuming the form of Kings will begin to eat human
beings. Agni Purāṇa states further that at that time,
Lord Viṣṇu will incarnate as Kalki, the son of Yaśas
and Yājñavalkya's priest and after training himself in
archery and weapons, annihilate all Mlecchas.
