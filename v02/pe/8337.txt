VIKRAMĀDITYA¦. Vikramāditya, who is believed to be
<div n="lb"/>one of the mighty emperors of Bhārata, was an extra-
<div n="lb"/>ordinarily wise, righteous and valiant ruler. There are
<div n="lb"/>several stories in all the languages of India, prevalent every-
<div n="lb"/>where. They are generally called Vikramāditya stories.
<div n="lb"/>Vikramāditya was the son of Mahendrāditya, King of
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayinī. Mahendrāditya and his wife Saumyadarśanā
<div n="lb"/>were in great distress as they were childless. Sumati,
<div n="lb"/>the Prime Minister, Vajrāyudha, the army commander,
<div n="lb"/>and Mahīdhara, the priest, were as distressed as the
<div n="lb"/>royal couple. The King and the queen engaged them-
<div n="lb"/>selves in fast and prayer.
<div n="NI"/>In the meanwhile, the Devas found life extremely
<div n="lb"/>difficult due to the wicked deeds of the barbarians, and
<div n="lb"/>they went to Kailāsa and told Rudradeva of their
<div n="lb"/>grievances. They said, “Oh! Lord! All the asuras
<div n="lb"/>exterminated by yourself and Mahāviṣṇu, are born
<div n="lb"/>on the earth as Barbarians. They commit great sins
<div n="lb"/>such as killing the Brahmins, obstructing sacrifices
<div n="lb"/>carrying away hermit damsels etc. The sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>offerings in the sacred fire with Vedic Mantras by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins, is the food of Devas. Because of the troubles
<div n="lb"/>caused by the Barbarians in the earth, the sacrifices are
<div n="lb"/>hindered and the Devas are in trouble due to lack of
<div n="lb"/>food. So a being, mighty and strong enough to ex-
<div n="lb"/>terminate all the Barbarians on the earth, should take
<div n="lb"/>incarnation.”
<div n="NI"/>Śiva agreed and sent the devas back to their world.
<div n="lb"/>Then he called Mālyavān and told him to take birth
<div n="lb"/>as the son of Mahendrāditya in the city of Ujjayinī.
[Page855-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Śiva added. “You should exterminate all the Barbarians
<div n="lb"/>and reinstate rituals and ceremonies. The Yakṣas,
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasas, ghosts etc. will be under your control. You
<div n="lb"/>will be an emperor there with divine powers.” Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly Mālyavān took birth as the son of Mahendrā-
<div n="lb"/>ditya. That infant was Vikramāditya who became a
<div n="lb"/>mighty emperor later. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Viṣamaśīla-
<div n="lb"/>lambaka, Taraṅga 1).
