VIKRAMĀDITYA¦. Vikramāditya, who is believed to be
one of the mighty emperors of Bhārata, was an extra-
ordinarily wise, righteous and valiant ruler. There are
several stories in all the languages of India, prevalent every-
where. They are generally called Vikramāditya stories.
Vikramāditya was the son of Mahendrāditya, King of
Ujjayinī. Mahendrāditya and his wife Saumyadarśanā
were in great distress as they were childless. Sumati,
the Prime Minister, Vajrāyudha, the army commander,
and Mahīdhara, the priest, were as distressed as the
royal couple. The King and the queen engaged them-
selves in fast and prayer.
<div n="NI"/>In the meanwhile, the Devas found life extremely
difficult due to the wicked deeds of the barbarians, and
they went to Kailāsa and told Rudradeva of their
grievances. They said, “Oh! Lord! All the asuras
exterminated by yourself and Mahāviṣṇu, are born
on the earth as Barbarians. They commit great sins
such as killing the Brahmins, obstructing sacrifices
carrying away hermit damsels etc. The sacrificial
offerings in the sacred fire with Vedic Mantras by
Brahmins, is the food of Devas. Because of the troubles
caused by the Barbarians in the earth, the sacrifices are
hindered and the Devas are in trouble due to lack of
food. So a being, mighty and strong enough to ex-
terminate all the Barbarians on the earth, should take
incarnation.”
<div n="NI"/>Śiva agreed and sent the devas back to their world.
Then he called Mālyavān and told him to take birth
as the son of Mahendrāditya in the city of Ujjayinī.

Śiva added. “You should exterminate all the Barbarians
and reinstate rituals and ceremonies. The Yakṣas,
Rākṣasas, ghosts etc. will be under your control. You
will be an emperor there with divine powers.” Accord-
ingly Mālyavān took birth as the son of Mahendrā-
ditya. That infant was Vikramāditya who became a
mighty emperor later. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Viṣamaśīla-
lambaka, Taraṅga 1).
