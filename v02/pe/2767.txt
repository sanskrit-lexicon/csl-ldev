INDRAPŪJĀ¦. This pūjā (Indra-worship) is also
called Indrotsava. It was during the reign of Vasu,
a king of the lunar dynasty that Indrotsava began
being celebrated in an organised manner. Pleased at
the long penance of Vasu, Indra appeared to him and
presented a Veṇudaṇḍa. Vasu planted the daṇḍa on
earth and conducted Indrapūjā. Thenceforward raising
the Veṇudaṇḍa became the first item in celebrating
Indrotsava. The staff is decorated with flowers, sandal,
garlands etc. To the top of the staff is attached the
form of a Haṃsa and offerings are given to it. The
reason for this is the fact that it was in the form of a
Haṃsa that Indra appeared to Vasu. Pleased by the
Indrapūjā of Vasu, Indra announced as follows:—If
men, and especially kings worship me in the manner
done by Vasu, prosperity and welfare will accrue to
them and to their kingdoms. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
63).
