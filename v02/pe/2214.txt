DUŚŚĪLĀ¦. A harlot who lived in Pratiṣṭhāna. One
Devadāsa was her husband. When Devadāsa had once
gone to the palace on some business Duśśīlā hid her
paramour, with the object of doing away with her
husband, on top of the ceiling of her room. He killed
Devadāsa while the latter was sleeping in the night.
Next day when people gathered at her house she gave
out the story that her husband was murdered by thieves.
But the people got the true story about the death of
Devadāsa from his four-year-old son and beat Duśśīlā
to death. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Śaktiyaśolaṃbaka,
Taraṅga 2).
