ĀRṢṬIṢEṆA¦. A Maharṣi. In the Mahābhārata, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 159 there is a reference to the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>visiting this sage during their life in the forest. Ārṣṭi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣeṇa's āśrama was midway between Badaryāśrama and
<div n="lb"/>Kubera's capital.
<div n="NI"/>{%Power of Tapas.%} In Kṛtayuga this sage did rigorous
<div n="lb"/>tapas in Pṛthūdakatīrtha. Owing to the rigour of the
<div n="lb"/>tapas he obtained all the chief vedas. He gave three
<div n="lb"/>boons to that sacred tīrtha:—
<div n="NI"/>1. Those who bathe in this tīrtha will get the benefit of
<div n="lb"/>Aśvamedha yāga.
<div n="NI"/>2. There will be no fear of snakes in this tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>3. A slight effort made here, will be rewarded with
<div n="lb"/>greater results.
<div n="NI"/>After giving these three boons to the river Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>which is Pṛthūdakatīrtha the sage attained Brahmin-
<div n="lb"/>hood and entered Devaloka. (M.B., Śalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 40, Verses 3-9).
