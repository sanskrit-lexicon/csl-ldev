JĀBĀLI IV¦. A hermit. The intensive penance of this
<div n="lb"/>hermit compelled Indra to depute the celestial maid
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā to hinder it. Jābāli became a prey to the entice-
<div n="lb"/>ment of this heavenly beauty and a daughter was born
<div n="lb"/>to them. This damsel was carried away by the King
<div n="lb"/>Citrāṅgada. The hermit Jābāli cursed Citrāṅgada to
<div n="lb"/>become a leper. (Skanda Purāṇa. Chapters 3, 143,
<div n="lb"/>and 144).
