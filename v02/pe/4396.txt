MARĪCI I¦. A Maharṣi (sage) born from Brahmā's
mind.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and Genealogy.%} The six great sages born from
Brahmā's mind were:—Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya,
Pulaha and Kratu, according to Mahābhārata, Ādi
Parva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Domestic life.%} Marīci had several wives and children.
He married Kalā, the daughter of Kardama Prajāpati
by his wife Devahūti. Marīci had two sons Kaśyapa
[Page487-b+ 64]
and Pūrṇiman by Kalā. This Kaśyapa was the original
ancestor of all living beings. But Pūrṇiman's family did
not become well-known. Pūrṇiman had two sons, Virajas
and Viśvaga and a daughter Devakulyā. Devakulyā
washed the feet of Mahāviṣṇu and merged with Ākāśa
Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>Ūrṇā was another wife of Marīci. Six sons were born
to Ūrṇā. Under a curse of Brahmā they were born first
as the sons of Hiraṇyakaśipu and in their next birth
as the sons of Vasudeva and Devakī. It was these six
children who were born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa's elder brothers
whom Kaṃsa killed immediately after their birth.
(See under Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Marīci had another wife named Sambhūti. She gave
birth to Paurṇamāsa. In Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part I, Chapter
10, we see that Paurṇamāsa who was a Mahātmā had
two sons Virajas and Parvata. Dharmavratā was yet
another wife of Marīci. She was a daughter born to
Dharmavatī by Dharmadeva.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Dharmavratā cursed.%} Marīci lived happily for long
with his wife Dharmavratā. Once he returned from
the forest, carrying darbha grass, flowers etc.
He was tired after a long walk. After taking food, he
wanted his wife to massage his legs. While she was
massaging him Marīci fell asleep. Just then Brahmā
happened to come there. Dharmavratā was in a fix.
She had to attend to her husband and at the same time
receive Brahmā with due respect. She could not leave
her husband's guru (Sire). It was her duty to honour
him properly.
<div n="NI"/>At last she got up and welcomed Brahmā, offering
him the customary honours. Meanwhile Marīci woke
up and not finding his wife near him cursed her to be
turned into a stone. Dharmavratā who was distressed
at the curse pleaded innocence and explained to him
that she had been honouring his guru. She warned him
that he would incur the curse of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Under Marīci's curse Dharmavratā was separated from
him. She performed penance in the midst of fires. Mahā-
viṣṇu appeared before her and asked her what boon
she wanted. She prayed that her curse might be lifted.
Viṣṇu replied:—“It was Marīci who cursed you. That
curse cannot be withdrawn. You will be turned into a
sacred stone. Your name “Dharmavratā” will be
changed into “Devavratā”. In future, that stone will
become famous under the name “Devavratā” or “Deva-
śilā”. Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara and goddesses like
Lakṣmī will dwell in that stone.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this, Mahāviṣṇu disappeared. Once
Dharmadeva held this Devaśilā above the demon Gaya
and the place became famous under the name of “Gayā
tīrtha”. (See under Gayātīrtha).
