VIDEGHA¦ MĀTHAVA A king born of the dynasty
of Mathu. There is an interesting story about this
king in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. It is as follows.
<div n="NI"/>Videgha put Agni in his mouth and lived without
talking, fearing that Agni might jump out. His priest
Rahūgaṇa tried to the utmost, but he could not extri-
cate fire from the mouth of the king.
<div n="NI"/>Once by chance the word Ghṛta got out of the mouth of
Rahūgaṇa. Instantly the fire in the mouth of the king
blazed into a big flame and burst out of the mouth.
That fire gradually increased and began to consume
the world, Rivers became dry. It seemed that even
Videgha and his priest would be burnt to ashes in that
blazing fire. At last Videgha got into the river Sadā-
nīrā, which flowed through the boundary of his own
kingdom, with the intention of not becoming a prey to
the ever-increasing fire. With this the fire abated.
