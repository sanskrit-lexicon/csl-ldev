VIPULA III¦. A hermit who was born in the dynasty of
Bhṛgu. There is a story showing how this hermit protect-
ed the wife of his teacher from Indra while he was the
disciple of the hermit Devaśarmā, in Mahābhārata,
Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 40. The story is given below:
Ruci, the wife of the hermit Devaśarmā, was extremely
beautiful. Devaśarmā was aware of the fact that Indra
had often looked at his wife with covetous eyes. He had
to perform a sacrifice. But he feared that if he went
away from the hermitage his wife would be carried away
by Indra. At last he called his beloved disciple Vipula
and revealed the secret to him. The teacher told his dis-
ciple that Indra was a libertine as well as a magician
and that he would appear in various forms to entice
Ruci, and asked him to protect Ruci even at the cost
of his life. Then Devaśarmā left the hermitage for the
sacrifice.
<div n="NI"/>Vipula followed the wife of his teacher, wherever she
went. He feared that Indra might come even unseen by
anybody. So he decided to get inside Ruci by super-
natural powers of Yoga. He made Ruci to sit in front of
him and stare into his eyes and through the rays of her
eyes he entered inside her.
<div n="NI"/>Knowing that Devaśarmā had left the hermitage, Indra
[Page858-b+ 64]
came in front of Ruci. By the power of Stambhana
(suppressing the use of faculties by mantra) Vipula
made Ruci stand motionless staring into the face of
Indra. She did not give any reply to the questions of
Indra. At last Indra looked into Ruci with inward eyes
and saw as in a mirror Vipula sitting inside her. With
shame Indra left the place instantly.
<div n="NI"/>When the teacher returned on completion of the sacri-
fice Vipula told him all that had taken place. The
teacher was pleased and told his disciple that he might
ask for any boon.
<div n="NI"/>He got the boon to be a righteous man throughout his
life and left the hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>It was during this period that the marriage of Prabhā-
vatī, the sister of Ruci, took place. The marriage of
Prabhāvatī with Citraratha, the king of Aṅga, was settled.
A messenger from Aṅga informed Ruci about it. Then
some flowers fell from the sky near Ruci. She wore
them and went to the marriage. Prabhāvatī wanted to
have the same flowers. Vipula was sent to bring flowers
of the same kind. As Vipula was returning with the
flowers, he saw two men turning a wheel. Each of them
claimed that he had turned more than the other, and
quarrelled with each other. One of them pointing at
Vipula, said that he who told lies would get what Vipula
would undergo in hell. Vipula was worried at hearing
this. He proceeded on his journey. He saw six men gamb-
ling. One of them pointed at Vipula and said “A false
gamester would get what Vipula would get in hell.”
Being flurried by these two talks, Vipula ran to his
teacher to understand its meaning. He went to Campā-
purī and saw the teacher and asked him the meaning of
what he had heard. The teacher told him, that the two
who turned the wheel were day and night and the six
who were engaged in gambling were the six Ṛtus (sea-
sons) and that Ṛtus and day and night are witnesses of
every sinful act committed any time. Vipula became
aware of his sin. While he was staying inside the wife of
his teacher, his genital touched her genital and face
touched face. He had not told the teacher this. But the
teacher said that it need not be considered a sin be-
cause the deed was done with no bad intention.
