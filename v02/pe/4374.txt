MANTHARĀ I¦. A maid of Kaikeyī the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Daśaratha. This hunchbacked woman was born of the
<div n="lb"/>species of a Gandharvī named Dundubhī. (Śloka 10,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 276, Vana Parva). When everything was
<div n="lb"/>made ready to crown Śrī Rāma as the heir-apparent
<div n="lb"/>of Ayodhyā, it was Mantharā who persuaded Kaikeyī
<div n="lb"/>to go to Daśaratha and ask him to send Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>to the forests. Had not the cruel tongue of Mantharā
<div n="lb"/>played like that, the history of the solar dynasty itself
<div n="lb"/>would have been different. (See under Kaikeyī).
