MANTHARĀ I¦. A maid of Kaikeyī the wife of
Daśaratha. This hunchbacked woman was born of the
species of a Gandharvī named Dundubhī. (Śloka 10,
Chapter 276, Vana Parva). When everything was
made ready to crown Śrī Rāma as the heir-apparent
of Ayodhyā, it was Mantharā who persuaded Kaikeyī
to go to Daśaratha and ask him to send Śrī Rāma
to the forests. Had not the cruel tongue of Mantharā
played like that, the history of the solar dynasty itself
would have been different. (See under Kaikeyī).
