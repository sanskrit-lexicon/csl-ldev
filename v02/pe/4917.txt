PADMĀVATĪ V¦. Daughter of Satyaketu, King of
Vidarbha. Ugrasena married her. After marriage she
went and stayed once in her father's house for a short
period. During that time through illegal intimacy with
a messenger from Kubera named Gobhila she became
pregnant. She started to destroy the foetus when from
inside a voice said “I am being born to wreak ven-
geance on Mahāviṣṇu for killing Kālanemi.” The son
born thus was Kaṃsa. (Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
