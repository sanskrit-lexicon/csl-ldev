DHANAŚARMĀ¦. A brahmin belonging to Madhyadeśa.
Once when Dhanaśarmā went to the forest to get
darbha he confronted three fierce evil spirits and gett-
ing frightened ran away from them. But the spirits
followed him and the Brahmin then cried and said
“Oh, please do not harm me. Mahāviṣṇu will bless
you.”
<div n="NI"/>The moment they heard the name of Viṣṇu there came
a change in them. They reiterated their story to
Dhanaśarmā. Their names were Vaiśākha, Sudāsa and
Advaita. Because of the ingratitude of Vaiśākha he
got a nick-name ‘Kṛtaghna’ (ungrateful man) also. All
the three were human beings in their previous birth.
Not only that, Advaita was a king called Harivīra.
All the three became evil spirits because of their sins.
<div n="NI"/>From the conversation Dhanaśarmā understood that
Vaiśākha was his father and they then knew each other.
[Page220-b+ 64]
The son then anxiously enquired what he should do to
absolve his father of his sins and save him from hell.
Vaiśākha then told him observe the vrata, Vaiśākha-
pūrṇimā. He did that and all the spirits went to
heaven. (Chapter 94, Padma Purāṇa).
