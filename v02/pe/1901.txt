DHANAŚARMĀ¦. A brahmin belonging to Madhyadeśa.
<div n="lb"/>Once when Dhanaśarmā went to the forest to get
<div n="lb"/>darbha he confronted three fierce evil spirits and gett-
<div n="lb"/>ing frightened ran away from them. But the spirits
<div n="lb"/>followed him and the Brahmin then cried and said
<div n="lb"/>“Oh, please do not harm me. Mahāviṣṇu will bless
<div n="lb"/>you.”
<div n="NI"/>The moment they heard the name of Viṣṇu there came
<div n="lb"/>a change in them. They reiterated their story to
<div n="lb"/>Dhanaśarmā. Their names were Vaiśākha, Sudāsa and
<div n="lb"/>Advaita. Because of the ingratitude of Vaiśākha he
<div n="lb"/>got a nick-name ‘Kṛtaghna’ (ungrateful man) also. All
<div n="lb"/>the three were human beings in their previous birth.
<div n="lb"/>Not only that, Advaita was a king called Harivīra.
<div n="lb"/>All the three became evil spirits because of their sins.
<div n="NI"/>From the conversation Dhanaśarmā understood that
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśākha was his father and they then knew each other.

<div n="lb"/>The son then anxiously enquired what he should do to
<div n="lb"/>absolve his father of his sins and save him from hell.
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśākha then told him observe the vrata, Vaiśākha-
<div n="lb"/>pūrṇimā. He did that and all the spirits went to
<div n="lb"/>heaven. (Chapter 94, Padma Purāṇa).
