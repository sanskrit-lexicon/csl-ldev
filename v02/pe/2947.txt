JAYADEVA I¦. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 13th cen-
<div n="lb"/>tury A.D. He is the author of the play ‘Prasannarāgha-
<div n="lb"/>vam’. As far as the story of Śrī Rāma is concerned,
<div n="lb"/>some changes have been made in this play from that
<div n="lb"/>given by Bhavabhūti in his ‘Mahāvīracarita’. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to this play Śrī Rāma and Bāṇāsura both were
<div n="lb"/>lovers of Sītā. The famous work ‘Candrāloka’, a trea-
<div n="lb"/>tise on rhetorical figures, was written by this poet Jaya-
<div n="lb"/>deva. His most important work is ‘Gītagovinda’, the
<div n="lb"/>theme of which is the early life of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, especially
<div n="lb"/>the love between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, which is very
<div n="lb"/>touchingly described. This book consists of 12 sargas
<div n="lb"/>and each sarga contains 24 octaves. This poet was a
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He used to sing lyrics before the
<div n="lb"/>image of Kṛṣṇa while his wife danced according to the
<div n="lb"/>beat.
