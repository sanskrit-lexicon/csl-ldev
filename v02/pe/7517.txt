TĀRĀ II¦. Wife of Bṛhaspati. She was extremely beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful. Once she fell in love with Candra (Moon) and
<div n="lb"/>leaving her husband started living with him. Candra
<div n="lb"/>was the disciple of Bṛhaspati. The devas were angry
<div n="lb"/>when they found the wife of their preceptor staying
<div n="lb"/>with a disciple of his. Bṛhaspati sent word to her to
<div n="lb"/>return home but she did not heed. At last the Devas
<div n="lb"/>decided to fight against Candra. Then they came to a
<div n="lb"/>compromise and Tārā was sent back to Bṛhaspati. In
<div n="lb"/>due course Tārā delivered a son. He was Budha, father
<div n="lb"/>of Purūravas. There arose then a dispute between
<div n="lb"/>Candra and Bṛhaspati regarding the fatherhood of the
<div n="lb"/>child. Then the Devas called Tārā and asked her to
<div n="lb"/>name the child's father. Tārā said that the child was
<div n="lb"/>of Candra and so Budha was looked after at the house
<div n="lb"/>of Candra. (9th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
