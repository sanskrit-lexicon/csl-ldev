TĀRĀ II¦. Wife of Bṛhaspati. She was extremely beauti-
ful. Once she fell in love with Candra (Moon) and
leaving her husband started living with him. Candra
was the disciple of Bṛhaspati. The devas were angry
when they found the wife of their preceptor staying
with a disciple of his. Bṛhaspati sent word to her to
return home but she did not heed. At last the Devas
decided to fight against Candra. Then they came to a
compromise and Tārā was sent back to Bṛhaspati. In
due course Tārā delivered a son. He was Budha, father
of Purūravas. There arose then a dispute between
Candra and Bṛhaspati regarding the fatherhood of the
child. Then the Devas called Tārā and asked her to
name the child's father. Tārā said that the child was
of Candra and so Budha was looked after at the house
of Candra. (9th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
