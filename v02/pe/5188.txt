PIṄGALA VII¦. A rākṣasa (demon). Once when this
demon was going through a forest he met a forester.
The latter got afraid and climbed up a Śamī tree. Then
a branch broke and it fell on the head of Gaṇeśa
sitting beneath that tree. It was an act of worship and
because of that both the forester and the demon were
elevated. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa).
