PIṄGALA VII¦. A rākṣasa (demon). Once when this
<div n="lb"/>demon was going through a forest he met a forester.
<div n="lb"/>The latter got afraid and climbed up a Śamī tree. Then
<div n="lb"/>a branch broke and it fell on the head of Gaṇeśa
<div n="lb"/>sitting beneath that tree. It was an act of worship and
<div n="lb"/>because of that both the forester and the demon were
<div n="lb"/>elevated. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa).
