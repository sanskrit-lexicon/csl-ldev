BUDDHA¦. The founder of Buddhism. Some consider
him to be an incarnation of Viṣṇu. In days of old in
a battle the devas were defeated by the asuras and the
gods approached Viṣṇu with their grievance. Mahā-
viṣṇu incarnated as the son of Śuddhodana with the
[Page165-b+ 65]
name Gautamabuddha (Siddhārtha). Then he went
to the asuras and made them reject the Vedas and the
laws thereof. All the Daityas (Asuras) became Bud-
dhists. There is a story in Agnipurāṇa, Chapter 16,
that thus it was the purpose of Buddha to convert
every asura to Buddhism and send him to hell.
<div n="NI"/>The story given above is in accordance with the Purā-
ṇas. The following are the facts gained by historic
investigations.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama Buddha was born in B.C. 560, in Kapilavastu
near the Himālayas. His father was Śuddhodana. He
was born in the family of the Śākyas. The word ‘Śākya’
is another form of the word Kṣatriya. The real name of
Buddha was Siddhārtha. Śuddhodana brought up his
son in such a way that he should not be subjected to
any sort of mental pain or worry. So he kept Buddha
aloof from the outer world. Thus he spent his childhood
in comfort and pleasure. Once by chance he happened
to see a sick man, an old man and a dead body. The
sight made him thoughtful. He began to think upon
a way to remove sorrow and pain from the world and
to bring about peace and comfort.
<div n="NI"/>The change that appeared in the son worried the
father. So at the age of sixteen he made Siddhārtha
marry Yaśodharā. A son was born to them. But the
mind of Siddhārtha was restless, distressed and agi-
tated. One day Siddhārtha discarded everything and
went out of the palace alone.
<div n="NI"/>Siddhārtha wandered from place to place learning
from various teachers. But he did not find peace.
Once on a full-moon day while he was sitting in medi-
tation under a banian tree he got ‘Bodha’. (insight or
conviction). From that day onwards he began to be
known by the name ‘Buddha’. After that he came to
Kāśi, and told his disciples how he got Bodha or con-
viction. The number of his followers increased day by
day. Thus Buddhism came into being. Buddha said
that the reason for pain and sorrow in the world was
desire and that sorrow could be exterminated only
by controlling and overcoming all desire. To attain
Eternal Bliss one should be true and righteous in
thought, deed and word and that ‘Not Killing’ was
the foundation of righteousness. Buddhism spread
everywhere in Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama Buddha died at the age of eighty.
