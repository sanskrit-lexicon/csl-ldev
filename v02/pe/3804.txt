KUMBHAKARṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
Pulastya—Viśravas—Kumbhakarṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Pulastya, one of the Prajāpatis married
Havirbhū (Māninī) and a son called Viśravas was
born to them.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa were born to Viśravas of
Puṣpotkaṭā, and Vibhīṣaṇa was born to him of Rākā,
and Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā were born to him of
Mālinī. The above version is based on verses—1 to 8 in
Chapter 275 of the Vana Parva. But, according to
Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa and Kumbha-
karṇa were born to Viśravas of his wife called Kaikasī.
According to the Agni Purāṇa, Puṣpotkaṭā and Kaikaśi
were one and the same.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Former births of Kumbhakarṇa.%} Rāvaṇa and Kumbha-
karṇa were originally the two Devas called Jaya and
Vijaya. Viṣṇu appointed them as gate-keepers at Vai-
kuṇṭha. Once they stopped sages like Sanaka and others
at the gates, and the latter cursed Jaya and Vijaya into
Rākṣasas. When they complained about the curse to
Viṣṇu he promised to welcome them back to Vaikuṇṭha
after they had lived three births as Rākṣasas. Accord-
ingly Jaya was born as Hiraṇyākṣa and Vijaya as
Hiraṇyakaśipu, both of them Asuras. Mahāviṣṇu incar-
nated himself as a Boar and killed Hiraṇyākṣa and
as Narasiṃha he killed Hiraṇyakaśipu. Hiraṇyākṣa and
Hiraṇyakaśipu were reborn as Rāvaṇa and Kumbha-
karṇa respectively. Mahāviṣṇu, during his incarnation
as Śrī Rāma killed both Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa.
Rāvaṇa was reborn as Śiśupāla and Kumbha-
karṇa as Dantavaktra. Both of them were killed by
Mahāviṣṇu during his incarnation as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Thus
the Deva called Vijaya, on account of the curse of
Sanaka and other sages, passed through three lives as
Hiraṇyakaśipu, Kumbhakarṇa and Dantavaktra and
finally reached Vaikuṇṭha. (Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kumbhakarṇa secured boons.%} Kumbhakarṇa spent his
childhood with his brothers at the āśrama of his father
on mount Gandhamādana. Kubera was at the zenith of
his glory at that time, having been crowned king of the
Yakṣas, and also having got the Puṣpaka Vimāna. The
reputation of Kubera kindled jealousy in Kumbhakarṇa
and his brothers. They too performed penance in the
forest on one foot for a thousand years. But, Brahmā
did not appear. They continued the penance without
eating any food. Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā stayed there
serving their brothers. Even after the second thousand
years Brahmā did not appear. Then Rāvaṇa cut off his
ten heads and made offerings of them to Brahmā. Then
Brahmā appeared. Brahmā restored his heads to Rāvaṇa
[Page440-a+ 64]
and he was granted the boon that he would not be
killed by anybody but a man. The Devas shuddered
at the gift to Rāvaṇa, and feared about the future in
case Kumbhakarṇa too got such a boon. At their request
Sarasvatī danced on his tongue at the time of
Kumbhakarṇa's request for a boon. Kumbha-
karṇa wanted NIRDEVATVAM (Absence of all
Devas). But by a slip of the tongue (caused by Saras-
vatī) what he asked for was nidrāvatvam (sleep).
Brahmā granted him nidrāvatvam; he said that Kum-
bhakarṇa would sleep for six months of the year
continuously. Vibhīṣaṇa got the boon that he should re-
member righteousness in danger and use the Brahmāstra
without any training in its use. The brothers returned
home after securing the boons, and, after driving off
Kubera, the lord of Laṅkā, Rāvaṇa and his brothers
took their abode there. (Vana Parva, Chapter 275 and
Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death of Kumbhakarṇa.%} Kumbhakarṇa played a very
important part in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war. Prominent
warriors on the side of Rāma, like Sugrīva, his minis-
ters and Lakṣmaṇa fought with him. But, none of them
could kill him. At last, Śrī Rāma's arrows killed him.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>Kumbhakarṇa is not to be viewed merely and purely
as an evil character. His advice to Rāvaṇa on various
occasions shows noble traits of his character. When Śrī
Rāma with his army of monkeys appeared on the other
side of the ocean Rāvaṇa held a conference of his
brothers, ministers and others at which Kumbhakarṇa
spoke as follows:—“You abducted Sītā without consult-
ing us, and we would not therefore be responsible for
the consequences of that action of yours. But, it is not
proper that the younger brother should keep away
when danger faces the elder one, and on that principle
here I am ready to fight Rāma.”
<div n="NI"/>These weighty words of Kumbhakarṇa throw consi-
derable light on the character of Kumbhakarṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddhakāṇḍa, Chapter 12).
