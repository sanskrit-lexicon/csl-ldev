GAṆḌAKĪ¦(GAṆḌAKA). A river in Orthern India
<div n="lb"/>which falls into the Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} There arose an argument between the
[Page274-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Devas and the asuras about the Amṛtam (nectar) got
<div n="lb"/>from the churning of Kṣīrābdhi (the milk ocean) and
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu appeared in the form of Mohinī and enti-
<div n="lb"/>ced the asuras away from the subject and gave the
<div n="lb"/>nectar to the Devas. Attracted by the great beauty of
<div n="lb"/>Mohinī, Śiva made love to her, and the sweet produced
<div n="lb"/>at the time of their embrace flowed as river Gaṇḍaki
<div n="lb"/>through the earth. (Skandha Purāṇa, Āsura Khaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%It became a holy river.%} While the worms on the banks
<div n="lb"/>of Gaṇḍakī were once collecting soil they fell into the
<div n="lb"/>river, and all at once they attained salvation, the reason
<div n="lb"/>being that the water in the river had been formed by
<div n="lb"/>the sweet of Viṣṇu and Śiva. And, from that day on-
<div n="lb"/>wards people began worshipping Gaṇḍakī as a holy
<div n="lb"/>river. (Skandha Purāṇa, Āsura Khaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) He who drinks the water of the river is freed from
<div n="lb"/>sins. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 169, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The river is also known as Nārāyaṇī, Śālagrāmī,
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇvatī and Hiraṇyavatī. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter

<div n="NI"/>(iii) Śrī Kṛṣṇa Arjuna and Bhīmasena once on their
<div n="lb"/>way from Indraprastha to Girivraja crossed this river.
<div n="lb"/>(Sabhā Parva, Chapter 20, Verse 27).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) The water in Gaṇḍakī is a mixture of the waters
<div n="lb"/>of all holy rivers. Therefore, a bath in Gaṇḍakī is of
