ŚYĀPARṆA¦(S). A priestly community. They were
<div n="lb"/>the priests of King Viśvantara. Once Viśvantara decided
<div n="lb"/>to perform a Somayāga. Without allowing Śyāparṇas
<div n="lb"/>to take part in that yāga, the King invited other priests
<div n="lb"/>for the purpose. At that time, Rāmabhārgaveya, one of
<div n="lb"/>the Śyāparṇas devised a new method concerning Soma-
<div n="lb"/>yāga and established his claim to priesthood. (Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmana, 7, 27).
