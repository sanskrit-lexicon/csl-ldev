ĀTREYĪ IV¦. Daughter of Maharṣi Atri. She was married
<div n="lb"/>to Aṅgiras, son of Agni. Aṅgiras always spoke rudely to
<div n="lb"/>her and pained at this she once approached her father
<div n="lb"/>and told him about this. Her father told her thus:
<div n="lb"/>“Your husband is the son of Agni. That is why he
<div n="lb"/>appears unbearable to you. Therefore give him a cold
<div n="lb"/>bath always and he would gradually become mild.”
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this the devout Ātreyī transformed herself into
<div n="lb"/>a river and started to cool him down by constant
<div n="lb"/>showers. This river later on became the famous Paruṣṇī
<div n="lb"/>Nadī. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
