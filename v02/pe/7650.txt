UCCAIŚŚRAVAS I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} A horse which emerged from water during
<div n="lb"/>the churning of the sea of Milk. (See under Kṣīrābdhi-
<div n="lb"/>mathana). Devendra grabbed it the moment he saw it,
<div n="lb"/>and thenceforth it became his vehicle. (M.B. Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 23, Verses 33-37).

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Colour of the horse.%} Once, during a controversy, Vinatā,
<div n="lb"/>wife of Kaśyapa, contended that the colour of Uccaiśśra-
<div n="lb"/>vas was white, while another wife of Kaśyapa, Kadrū
<div n="lb"/>said that its tail was black in colour. It was decided to bet
<div n="lb"/>that she who got defeated in this controversy should
<div n="lb"/>become the slave of the winner. Because the serpents,
<div n="lb"/>the sons of Kadrū, cheated Vinatā, she had to become
<div n="lb"/>Kadrū's slave. (See under Vinatā). (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 20).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Lakṣmīdevī became mare.%} Devī Bhāgavata relates a
<div n="lb"/>story of Mahālakṣmī becoming a mare on account of
<div n="lb"/>Uccaiś ravas. King Revanta, son of Sūrya and friend of
<div n="lb"/>Indra, once went to Vaikuṇṭha to pay his respects to
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān Viṣṇu, riding on Uccaiśśravas. Mahālakṣmī,
<div n="lb"/>who was then with Viṣṇu was surprised at the arri-
<div n="lb"/>val of Revanta. Seeing the scintillating form of
<div n="lb"/>Uccaiśśravas, her brother, Mahālakṣmi sat looking at
<div n="lb"/>the horse unmindful of all other things. (Mahālakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>and the horse were both born from the Sea of Milk and
<div n="lb"/>hence were sister and brother). Thus occupied Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī did not hear Mahāviṣṇu asking, “Who is this one
<div n="lb"/>who comes like a second Cupid?” Angry at this Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>said—
<div n="NI"/>“So much attracted by the horse, you have not answered
<div n="lb"/>me. Because you enjoy (Ramasi) so much your name in
<div n="lb"/>future will be Ramā. You will also become frivolous
<div n="lb"/>like an uncultured woman. You have never been
<div n="lb"/>constant. Because you felt so much attracted to this
<div n="lb"/>horse in my very presence, you will be born as a mare
<div n="lb"/>in the world of men.”
<div n="NI"/>According to this curse Mahālakṣmī had to be born as
<div n="lb"/>a mare in the world; the Hehaya dynasty had its origin
<div n="lb"/>from her. (See under Ekavīra). (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 6).
