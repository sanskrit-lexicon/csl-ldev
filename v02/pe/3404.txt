KAṬVĀKU¦ (KHAṬVĀKU). A son of Vaivasvata Manu.
Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa states that he was an ancestor of
Ikṣvāku.
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning Manu, alias Vaivasvata, had a son
named Kaṭvāku. He was the first of kings and he ruled
[Page399-a+ 65]
the world for a long time. On the banks of the river
Sarayū he constructed a city called Ayodhyā. Ayodhyā
was celebrated for its beauty and wise men proclaimed
that it was more beautiful than the cities of the eight
guards of the universe or the city of even Brahmā, the
Creator.
