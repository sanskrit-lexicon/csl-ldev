CITRARATHA I¦. (AṄGĀRAPARṄA). A devagan-
<div n="lb"/>dharva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Citraratha was the gandharva son of
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapaprajāpati of his wife Muni. (Śloka 43, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>65, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Citraratha and Arjuna.%} The greatest event in the
<div n="lb"/>life of Citraratha alias Aṅgāraparṇa was the defeat he
<div n="lb"/>suffered at the hands of Arjuna. The Pāṇḍavas after
<div n="lb"/>their escape from the lac palace (Lākṣāgṛha) through
<div n="lb"/>a tunnel arrived in a forest and there they killed the
<div n="lb"/>demons Hiḍiṃba and Baka. One night they were
<div n="lb"/>walking along the shores of the river Gaṅgā when they
<div n="lb"/>heard a sound of somebody bathing in the river. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>who was walking ahead waving a country torch went
<div n="lb"/>to see who was bathing at that time of the night. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>then saw Citraratha enjoying a bath with his wife
<div n="lb"/>Kumbhīnasī. That period of the night was allotted to
<div n="lb"/>the gandharvas, and human beings were not expected
<div n="lb"/>to be out walking at that time. Citraratha felt it
<div n="lb"/>impertinent that Arjuna a human being should be out
<div n="lb"/>walking at night and peep into the privacy of the
<div n="lb"/>gandharvas. The gandharva and Arjuna so entered into
<div n="lb"/>a combat. Citraratha who was a great fighter was,
<div n="lb"/>after a grim battle, subdued, bound hand and foot, and
<div n="lb"/>brought before his brothers by Arjuna. Kumbhīnasī
<div n="lb"/>followed her exhausted, powerless and spiritless husband
<div n="lb"/>and pleaded to Dharmaputra to release him. Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra advised Arjuna to do so and on getting his release
<div n="lb"/>he taught Arjuna the famous Cākṣuṣīvidyā—the magic
<div n="lb"/>art of seeing by one's own eyes anything and everything
<div n="lb"/>in the three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether-
<div n="lb"/>world. Manu was the author of this magic art and from
<div n="lb"/>him Soma learnt it and from Soma Viśvāvasu, from
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāvasu, Citraratha and from Citraratha, Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>Besides this Citraratha gave Arjuna many chariots
<div n="lb"/>and horses.
<div n="NI"/>In return Arjuna taught him the secret of the missile
<div n="lb"/>Agniśira. Exchanging faith and affection thus Citraratha
<div n="lb"/>and the Pāṇḍavas became friends. He then narrated to
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas many interesting stories, of which the
<div n="lb"/>following are a few. The story of the feud between
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, story of Tapatīsaṃvaraṇa
<div n="lb"/>and tales about the sage Parāśara, Kalmāṣapāda,
<div n="lb"/>Adṛśyantī, Bhārgavas, Kṛtavīrya and Aurva. Citra-
<div n="lb"/>ratha advised the Pāṇḍavas to have a priest for the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial rites and it was thus that they engaged
<div n="lb"/>Dhaumya as their family priest.
<div n="NI"/>Since Arjuna had destroyed all the chariots belonging to
<div n="lb"/>Citraratha, the latter got a name ‘Bhagnaratha’ (devoid
<div n="lb"/>of chariots). Citraratha admitted that Arjuna could
[Page186-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>conquer him because of his vow of celibacy. (Chapters
<div n="lb"/>165 to 183, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Citraratha attended one of the birthday festivals of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. (Śloka 52, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Citraratha worshipped Kubera sitting in the latter's
<div n="lb"/>council. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 10, Śloka 26).
<div n="NI"/>(3) He offered as a gift to Dharmaputra four hundred
<div n="lb"/>excellent horses which could fly like wind. (Chapter 52,
<div n="lb"/>Śloka 23, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) When the gandharvas milked the earth during the
<div n="lb"/>time of the emperor, Pṛthu, Citraratha acted as the calf.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 39, Chapter 6, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Śiva once sent Citraratha as a messenger to Asura
<div n="lb"/>Śaṃkhacūḍa, with a message that Śaṃkhacūḍa should
<div n="lb"/>abandon his satanic activities. (Devī Bhāgavata, Nava-
<div n="lb"/>ma Skandha).
