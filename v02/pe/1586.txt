CITRARATHA I¦. (AṄGĀRAPARṄA). A devagan-
dharva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Citraratha was the gandharva son of
Kaśyapaprajāpati of his wife Muni. (Śloka 43, Chapter
65, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Citraratha and Arjuna.%} The greatest event in the
life of Citraratha alias Aṅgāraparṇa was the defeat he
suffered at the hands of Arjuna. The Pāṇḍavas after
their escape from the lac palace (Lākṣāgṛha) through
a tunnel arrived in a forest and there they killed the
demons Hiḍiṃba and Baka. One night they were
walking along the shores of the river Gaṅgā when they
heard a sound of somebody bathing in the river. Arjuna
who was walking ahead waving a country torch went
to see who was bathing at that time of the night. Arjuna
then saw Citraratha enjoying a bath with his wife
Kumbhīnasī. That period of the night was allotted to
the gandharvas, and human beings were not expected
to be out walking at that time. Citraratha felt it
impertinent that Arjuna a human being should be out
walking at night and peep into the privacy of the
gandharvas. The gandharva and Arjuna so entered into
a combat. Citraratha who was a great fighter was,
after a grim battle, subdued, bound hand and foot, and
brought before his brothers by Arjuna. Kumbhīnasī
followed her exhausted, powerless and spiritless husband
and pleaded to Dharmaputra to release him. Dharma-
putra advised Arjuna to do so and on getting his release
he taught Arjuna the famous Cākṣuṣīvidyā—the magic
art of seeing by one's own eyes anything and everything
in the three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether-
world. Manu was the author of this magic art and from
him Soma learnt it and from Soma Viśvāvasu, from
Viśvāvasu, Citraratha and from Citraratha, Arjuna.
Besides this Citraratha gave Arjuna many chariots
and horses.
<div n="NI"/>In return Arjuna taught him the secret of the missile
Agniśira. Exchanging faith and affection thus Citraratha
and the Pāṇḍavas became friends. He then narrated to
the Pāṇḍavas many interesting stories, of which the
following are a few. The story of the feud between
Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, story of Tapatīsaṃvaraṇa
and tales about the sage Parāśara, Kalmāṣapāda,
Adṛśyantī, Bhārgavas, Kṛtavīrya and Aurva. Citra-
ratha advised the Pāṇḍavas to have a priest for the
sacrificial rites and it was thus that they engaged
Dhaumya as their family priest.
<div n="NI"/>Since Arjuna had destroyed all the chariots belonging to
Citraratha, the latter got a name ‘Bhagnaratha’ (devoid
of chariots). Citraratha admitted that Arjuna could
[Page186-b+ 65]
conquer him because of his vow of celibacy. (Chapters
165 to 183, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Citraratha attended one of the birthday festivals of
Arjuna. (Śloka 52, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Citraratha worshipped Kubera sitting in the latter's
council. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 10, Śloka 26).
<div n="NI"/>(3) He offered as a gift to Dharmaputra four hundred
excellent horses which could fly like wind. (Chapter 52,
Śloka 23, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) When the gandharvas milked the earth during the
time of the emperor, Pṛthu, Citraratha acted as the calf.
(Śloka 39, Chapter 6, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Śiva once sent Citraratha as a messenger to Asura
Śaṃkhacūḍa, with a message that Śaṃkhacūḍa should
abandon his satanic activities. (Devī Bhāgavata, Nava-
ma Skandha).
