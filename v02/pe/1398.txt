CĀKYĀRKŪTTU¦. A very important art practised in
<div n="lb"/>temples mainly in Kerala. It is called so because it is
<div n="lb"/>exhibited by Cākyārs (a sect attached to temples). In
<div n="lb"/>important temples a place called Kūttambala is set
<div n="lb"/>apart for displaying the art. The Kūttu now prevalent
<div n="lb"/>in Kerala temples is not exactly of its old form. Kula-
<div n="lb"/>śekharavarmā perumāl (elected ruler of old Kerala)
<div n="lb"/>effected some changes in the old art form, and Bhāskara-
<div n="lb"/>ravivarmā perumāl and Tolakavi made further reforms
<div n="lb"/>in it. The art of Kūttu was evolved with the object of
<div n="lb"/>relating purāṇic stories in such a manner as will help
<div n="lb"/>devotional feelings grow in man.
<div n="NI"/>The main aim of the Kūttu is to narrate purāṇic
<div n="lb"/>stories in such a way as to instil Bhakti in the hearers
<div n="lb"/>and to create an interest in them in the Purāṇas. The
<div n="lb"/>Cākyār (the man who gives the discourse who usually
<div n="lb"/>belongs to the Brahmin sect called Cākyārs) tells the
<div n="lb"/>story in a very interesting way, reciting appropriate
<div n="lb"/>passages from the Purāṇas and illustrating them with
<div n="lb"/>apt examples and similes. The narration is from the
<div n="lb"/>beginning till end humorous. The Cākyār who delivers
<div n="lb"/>the discourse is usually a man with a good sense of
<div n="lb"/>humour and a sense of what is odd, strange or eccentric
<div n="lb"/>in nature and human character. There are three varie-
[Page168-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ties of Kūttu: Prabandhaṃ Kūttu, Naṃbiar Kūttu and
<div n="lb"/>Kūṭiāṭṭam. Of these the first is narrative (Ākhyāna-
<div n="lb"/>para) while in the second and third type, the element
<div n="lb"/>of acting is more important (Abhinayapara).
