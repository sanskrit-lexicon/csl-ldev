AŚVATTHĀMĀ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and genealogy.%} The semen of Bharadvāja Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>fell into the hollow of a bamboo and from there was
<div n="lb"/>born Droṇa. As per the instructions of his father Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>married Kṛpī, daughter of the sage, Śāradvata. The
<div n="lb"/>good-natured Kṛpī gave birth to Aśvatthāmā. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Droṇa for genealogy). (Chapter 130, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.)
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got his name.%} The moment he was born he
<div n="lb"/>made a loud hoot like Uccaiśravas and the sound resem-
<div n="lb"/>bled the braying of a horse. Immediately a voice from
<div n="lb"/>heaven said that the boy should be named Aśvatthāmā.
[Page068-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>The boy was, therefore, named so. (Ślokas 48 and 49,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 130, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Training in archery.%} Aśvatthāmā took his lesson in
<div n="lb"/>archery from his father Droṇa. At that time Droṇa got
<div n="lb"/>new lessons from Paraśurāma and they were also im-
<div n="lb"/>parted to Droṇa's disciples. When Droṇa became the
<div n="lb"/>preceptor of the Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas Aśvatthāmā
<div n="lb"/>also went with him. (Ślokas 52 to 64, Chapter 130, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Droṇa's affection for his son.%} Droṇa was very affec-
<div n="lb"/>tionate to his son and wanted to teach him something
<div n="lb"/>special in archery. So he used to instruct him during
<div n="lb"/>the time the other disciples went to fetch water for the
<div n="lb"/>āśrama. Arjuna came to know of this and he, there-
<div n="lb"/>after, started bringing his quota of water quickly
<div n="lb"/>enough to join the special class of Droṇa. Thus Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and Aśvatthāmā learned a lot more than the others in
<div n="lb"/>the military art. (Ślokas 17-19, Chapter 132, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The Mahābhārata Battle and Aśvatthāmā.%} In Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva we find Aśvatthāmā participating in the Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>sūya of Yudhiṣṭhira. After that we meet him only at
<div n="lb"/>the Kurukṣetra war. Fighting on the side of the Kau-
<div n="lb"/>ravas he played a very important role in that war. He
<div n="lb"/>killed many veteran warriors and kings including the
<div n="lb"/>following: Nīla, Añjanaparvā, Suratha, Śatruñjaya,
<div n="lb"/>Balānīka, Jayānīka, Jayāśva, Srutāśva, Hemamālī, Vṛṣa-
<div n="lb"/>dhara, Candrasena, the ten sons of Kuntibhoja, Sudar-
<div n="lb"/>śana, Vṛddhakṣetra, Cedirāja, Malayadhvaja and Sura-
<div n="lb"/>tha. He defeated many including Śikhaṇḍī, Abhimanyu,
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa, Sātyaki and Vindhya. By using Āgneyāstra
<div n="lb"/>(the arrow of fire) he made Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna fall
<div n="lb"/>fainting in the battle-field. He commanded the Kaurava
<div n="lb"/>army once. He killed many Pāñcālas and Somakas
<div n="lb"/>while they were sleeping. In Chapter 139 of Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva we read about Arjuna defeating Aśvatthāmā in
<div n="lb"/>a single combat one day.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Aśvatthāmā sees a ghost.%} Dhṛṣṭadyumna, son of King
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcāla, killed Droṇa. When Aśvatthāmā heard of
<div n="lb"/>his father's death his rage knew no bound. He imme-
<div n="lb"/>diately went to the heart of the military camp of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas, Kṛpa and Sātvata following him. There at the
<div n="lb"/>gate of the camp he beheld a ghostly apparition. It is
<div n="lb"/>described in the Bhāṣā Bhārata (Malayālam version of
<div n="lb"/>M.B.) as follows: He saw a huge figure standing at the
<div n="lb"/>door with a body blazing like the Sun and the Moon.
<div n="lb"/>Bathed in blood and wearing a tiger's skin in the loins
<div n="lb"/>the figure wore a snake as his sacred thread and cover-
<div n="lb"/>ed his upper body with a deer-skin. There were innu-
<div n="lb"/>merable hands for this ghost and in each hand adorned
<div n="lb"/>with snake-bangles he held a deadly weapon. With
<div n="lb"/>crooked teeth and a ghastly face the goblin gave a
<div n="lb"/>shiver to those who saw him. Flames bursting forth
<div n="lb"/>from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth he barred the way
<div n="lb"/>of Aśvatthāmā. Undaunted the son of Droṇa showered
<div n="lb"/>divine arrows on the figure. But the ghost by his sup-
<div n="lb"/>reme powers absorbed the arrows to his body the
<div n="lb"/>moment they touched him. In despair Aśvatthāmā
<div n="lb"/>meditated on Śiva and the latter appearing before him
<div n="lb"/>in person gave him a divine dagger. With that he entered
<div n="lb"/>the bed-chamber of Dhṛṣṭadyumna, woke him up by
<div n="lb"/>striking him with his foot, caught hold of him by the
<div n="lb"/>hair on his head and killed him.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Aśvatthāmā and his jewel.%} The anger of Aśyatthāmā did
<div n="lb"/>not abate even after killing Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the butcher
[Page069-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>of his father. With a view to destroying the whole Pāṇḍ-
<div n="lb"/>ava dynasty he sent against the Pāṇḍavas the all-power-
<div n="lb"/>ful Brahmaśirāstra (a missile charged with great power
<div n="lb"/>by a holy incantation). But Droṇa had given the same
<div n="lb"/>type of missile to Arjuna also and so he sent forth his to
<div n="lb"/>meet the other. It created such a great explosion that
<div n="lb"/>all the elders on both the sides joined together and re-
<div n="lb"/>quested them to withdraw the missiles. Arjuna demanded
<div n="lb"/>the jewel on Aśvatthāmā's head to withdraw his missile.
<div n="lb"/>But Aśvatthāmā refused to part with it. He said, “This
<div n="lb"/>jewel of mine is more valuable than all the wealth of both
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas put together. If you wear this
<div n="lb"/>you need not be afraid of your enemies, disease, hunger
<div n="lb"/>and thirst. No harm will come to you from Yakṣas,
<div n="lb"/>Nāgas or thieves. I will never part with such a jewel”.
<div n="lb"/>(Ślokas 28-30, M.B., Chapter 15, Sautika Parva). After
<div n="lb"/>great persuasion Aśvatthāmā surrendered his jewel but
<div n="lb"/>without withdrawing the missile directed it towards the
<div n="lb"/>womb of Uttarā who was bearing a child then. We
<div n="lb"/>are reminded of an incident which happened when
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas were residing in Upaplāvya; a poor
<div n="lb"/>brahmin looking at Uttarā said, “When the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>will be weakening in power a child will be born to you.
<div n="lb"/>The boy will have to bear a test even while in the
<div n="lb"/>womb and so you must name the child Parīkṣit (One
<div n="lb"/>who has been tested)”.
<div n="NI"/>When the powerful missile was flying straight towards
<div n="lb"/>Uttarā's womb Śrī Kṛṣṇa said, “Even though the child
<div n="lb"/>in the womb will die of this arrow it will be reborn.
<div n="lb"/>Oh, Aśvatthāmā, you will be denounced by all as a
<div n="lb"/>sinner for killing this unborn babe. To suffer for this
<div n="lb"/>evil deed you will roam about in the earth for three
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. Nobody will associate with you; you will
<div n="lb"/>be shunned by society. You will be tormented by all
<div n="lb"/>diseases on earth. But the babe which you have now
<div n="lb"/>killed will be a famous scholar and brave King. He will
<div n="lb"/>rule this country for sixty years. He will be known
<div n="lb"/>as the next Kururāja. Look, I am giving life to the babe
<div n="lb"/>you have killed”. Vyāsa supported Kṛṣṇa, and Aśvat-
<div n="lb"/>thāmā repenting on his hasty action gave the jewel to
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas and left for the forest with Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>(Sautika Parva, M.B.).
