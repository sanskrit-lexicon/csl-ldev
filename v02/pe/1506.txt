CATURMUKHALIṄGA¦. A Brahma liṅga installed on
the northern bank of Sarasvatī by Brahmā. Brahmā,
to start with, created animate and inanimate objects,
and was thinking about further creation when a beauti-
ful girl, born of herself appeared before him. Brahmā
became enamoured of that girl and showed an unbe-
coming passion. As a punishment for this sin one of his
heads broke. Thus broken-headed Brahmā, went to
the Sthāṇutīrtha, which washes off all sins, on the north-
ern bank of Sarasvatī and installed his own liṅga, known
as the Caturmukhaliṅga. This installation of liṅga
redeemed him from sins. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 49).
