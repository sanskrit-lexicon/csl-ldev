SANYĀSA¦ (SANNYĀSA) One of the four stages of
<div n="lb"/>Brahminical life. The four stages are Brahmacarya
<div n="lb"/>(Religious student), Gārhasthya (householder), Vāna-
<div n="lb"/>prastha (Forest-dweller) and Sannyāsa (hermit or sage).
<div n="lb"/>(For further details see under Āśrama).
<div n="NI"/>{%Duties of a hermit.%} Manu has ordained that one should
<div n="lb"/>perform sannyāsa (renunciation) at the fourth stage of
<div n="lb"/>life renouncing every tie with the world. After becoming
<div n="lb"/>a hermit he should travel daily alone. He should enter
<div n="lb"/>villages only for food. He should have renounced
<div n="lb"/>wealth. He should not acquire any wealth. He should
<div n="lb"/>be a sage filled with knowledge. He should have a
<div n="lb"/>skull as the pot for taking alms. He should sleep under
<div n="lb"/>trees. He should wear poor cloth and should be solitary.
<div n="lb"/>He should consider everybody as equal. Having become
<div n="lb"/>a hermit he should not delight in death or life.
<div n="NI"/>A hermit should put every step looking straight down to
<div n="lb"/>the earth. He should drink water filtered by cloth.
<div n="lb"/>Words and deeds should be pure and true. The shells
<div n="lb"/>of water-gourd (pumpkin), wooden pots and earthen
<div n="lb"/>pots are the Vaiṣṇava sign of hermits. A hermit should
<div n="lb"/>beg for food daily from houses where no smoke comes
<div n="lb"/>out, where pestle is placed and where there is no char-
<div n="lb"/>coal, and after all have taken food and the pot for pre-
<div n="lb"/>paring food is placed upside down.
<div n="NI"/>It is said that the food got by hermits by begging is of
<div n="lb"/>five types. They are Mādhūkara (collected alms),
<div n="lb"/>asaṃkḷpta (unlimited), Prākpraṇīta (prepared much
<div n="lb"/>earlier), Ayācitam (got by not begging) and tātkālika
<div n="lb"/>(for the time being). In whichever stage of life he
<div n="lb"/>may be, he should be staunch in that stage and should
<div n="lb"/>perform the duties with honesty.
<div n="NI"/>If by ignorance a hermit engaged himself in killing
<div n="lb"/>animals by day or night, to remove the impurity and get
<div n="lb"/>purity, he should bathe and perform six prāṇāyāmas
<div n="lb"/>(restraints of the breath) daily. The hermit should
<div n="lb"/>discard his body made of five elements.
<div n="NI"/>The signs of duty are, resolution, forbearance, selfres-
<div n="lb"/>traint, not robbing, cleansing, control of sense-organs,
<div n="lb"/>modesty, knowledge, truth, not resorting to anger, and
<div n="lb"/>so on. Hermits are of four grades, such as Kuṭīcaka,
<div n="lb"/>Bahūdaka, Haṃsa and Paramahaṃsa, the last-mentioned
<div n="lb"/>being the noblest grade. The hermit who wears one or
<div n="lb"/>three daṇḍas (rod) will be freed from ties of birth and
<div n="lb"/>death.
<div n="NI"/>The five Yamas or restraints are not killing (Ahiṃsā),
<div n="lb"/>truth, not stealing, celibacy and not receiving. The
<div n="lb"/>five Niyamas or religious duties are cleansing, joy or
<div n="lb"/>contentedness, penance, self-study and meditation on
<div n="lb"/>God. The sitting postures suitable for hermits are
<div n="lb"/>Padmāsana etc. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 161).
