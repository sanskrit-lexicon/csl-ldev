ŚRĪMATĪ I¦. A Gandharva maid. In Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddhakāṇḍa there is a story associating this Gandharva
maid with the churning of the ocean of milk:-
<div n="NI"/>A Gandharva maid named Śrīmatī who had acquired
incomparable proficiency in music used to sing hymns in
praise of Lakṣmīdevī. Devī appeared before her and
presented a garland of Kalpaka flowers to Śrīmatī. As
she was returning with the garland, she met sage
Durvāsas on the way. She offered the garland to him.
Durvāsas who reached Devaloka with the garland gave
it to Indra. Indra used it for adorning the tusk of
Airāvata. Airāvata who was annoyed at it threw it away
in a fury. Durvāsas took it as a personal insult to him
and in his rage cursed all the gods to be subjected to
the infirmities of old age. It is to save them from the
effects of old age that the ocean of milk was churned to
obtain Amṛta. (For more details see under Amṛta).
