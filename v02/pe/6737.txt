ŚRĪMATĪ I¦. A Gandharva maid. In Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddhakāṇḍa there is a story associating this Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>maid with the churning of the ocean of milk:-
<div n="NI"/>A Gandharva maid named Śrīmatī who had acquired
<div n="lb"/>incomparable proficiency in music used to sing hymns in
<div n="lb"/>praise of Lakṣmīdevī. Devī appeared before her and
<div n="lb"/>presented a garland of Kalpaka flowers to Śrīmatī. As
<div n="lb"/>she was returning with the garland, she met sage
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas on the way. She offered the garland to him.
<div n="lb"/>Durvāsas who reached Devaloka with the garland gave
<div n="lb"/>it to Indra. Indra used it for adorning the tusk of
<div n="lb"/>Airāvata. Airāvata who was annoyed at it threw it away
<div n="lb"/>in a fury. Durvāsas took it as a personal insult to him
<div n="lb"/>and in his rage cursed all the gods to be subjected to
<div n="lb"/>the infirmities of old age. It is to save them from the
<div n="lb"/>effects of old age that the ocean of milk was churned to
<div n="lb"/>obtain Amṛta. (For more details see under Amṛta).
