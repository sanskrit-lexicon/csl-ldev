UPAKĪCAKAS¦. Kīcaka, the brother-in-law of King
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa, had one hundred and five brothers. They are
<div n="lb"/>called Upakīcakas. Kīcaka and the Upakīcakas were
<div n="lb"/>born of a portion of Kālakeya an asura. At the palace
<div n="lb"/>of Virāṭa, Kīcaka harassed Pāñcālī and was killed in
<div n="lb"/>the night by Bhīma. (See under Kīcaka). Hearing
<div n="lb"/>about the death of Kīcaka, the hundred and five Upakī-
<div n="lb"/>cakas came there and decided to burn Pāñcālī also,
<div n="lb"/>because they thought she was the cause of the death
<div n="lb"/>of their elder brother. They bound and carried her to
<div n="lb"/>the cremation ground. Hearing her loud cry, Bhīma
<div n="lb"/>jumped over the wall and ran to the cremation ground.
<div n="lb"/>He uprooted a tree, killed all the hundred and five
<div n="lb"/>Upakīcakas and brought Pāñcālī to the palace. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 23).
