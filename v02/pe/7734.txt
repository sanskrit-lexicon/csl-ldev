UPAKĪCAKAS¦. Kīcaka, the brother-in-law of King
Virāṭa, had one hundred and five brothers. They are
called Upakīcakas. Kīcaka and the Upakīcakas were
born of a portion of Kālakeya an asura. At the palace
of Virāṭa, Kīcaka harassed Pāñcālī and was killed in
the night by Bhīma. (See under Kīcaka). Hearing
about the death of Kīcaka, the hundred and five Upakī-
cakas came there and decided to burn Pāñcālī also,
because they thought she was the cause of the death
of their elder brother. They bound and carried her to
the cremation ground. Hearing her loud cry, Bhīma
jumped over the wall and ran to the cremation ground.
He uprooted a tree, killed all the hundred and five
Upakīcakas and brought Pāñcālī to the palace. (M.B.
Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 23).
