PITṚ¦(S). Pitṛs are a set of demigods. From Manu-
prajāpati, son of Brahmā, were born the Saptarṣis like
Marīci and they in turn created the Pitṛs. Besides
Marīci and his set many others like Virāṭ Puruṣa and
Brahmā have created Pitṛs. Some Purāṇas state that
Pitṛs are of daily creation. Brahmā in the beginning
created three sets of Pitṛs with form and four with
brightness making thus seven sets. The three sets of
bodied pitṛs are Agniṣvāttas, Barhiṣadas and Somapās
and the four bright ones are Yama, Anala, Soma and
Aryaman (10th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).

Pitṛs (manes) are classified into two types: The Agni-
ṣvāttas and Barhiṣadas. Of these the Agniṣvāttas do
not perform Yāgas and the Barhiṣadas are those who
perform yāgas. Besides these two major divisions they
are classified into many other groups as follows:
<div n="NI"/>1. {%Somasadasya (s).%} Virāṭ Puruṣa is the creator of these
Pitṛs. Somasadasyas are the Pitṛs of Sādhyadevas.
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Agniṣvātta (s).%} They are the pitṛs of devas.
<div n="NI"/>3. {%Barhiṣadas.%} These Pitṛs are the creation of the sage
Atri. They are the manes of daityas, dānavas, yakṣas,
gandharvas, uragas (serpents), rākṣasas (demons),
suvarṇas and kinnaras.

<div n="NI"/>4. {%Somapā (s).%} They are the sons of the sage Bhṛgu and
are the manes of brahmins.
<div n="NI"/>5. {%Havirbhuk (s).%} The sage Aṅgiras is the father of
these Pitṛs who are the manes of Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>6. {%Ājyapā (s).%} These are the sons of the sage Pulastya
and are the manes of Vaiśyas.
<div n="NI"/>7. {%Sukālika (s).%} Sons of the sage Vasiṣṭha, these Pitṛs
are the manes of the Śūdras.
<div n="NI"/>To the seven sages like Marīci were born the pitṛs and
to the pitṛs were born the devāsuras (devas and asuras)
and to the devāsuras were born everything else in this
universe, animate and inanimate. (Chapter 3, Manu-
smṛti).
<div n="NI"/>Performing a Śrāddha (offering obsequial oblations
to the departed) is just like a yajña. The oblations
should be offered in either silver or silver cum copper
pots. Viśvadevas are the guardians of the pitṛs. There-
fore the oblations should be offered after worshipping
the Viśvadevas first and then the pitṛs and then Viṣṇu.
