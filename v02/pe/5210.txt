PITṚ¦(S). Pitṛs are a set of demigods. From Manu-
<div n="lb"/>prajāpati, son of Brahmā, were born the Saptarṣis like
<div n="lb"/>Marīci and they in turn created the Pitṛs. Besides
<div n="lb"/>Marīci and his set many others like Virāṭ Puruṣa and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā have created Pitṛs. Some Purāṇas state that
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛs are of daily creation. Brahmā in the beginning
<div n="lb"/>created three sets of Pitṛs with form and four with
<div n="lb"/>brightness making thus seven sets. The three sets of
<div n="lb"/>bodied pitṛs are Agniṣvāttas, Barhiṣadas and Somapās
<div n="lb"/>and the four bright ones are Yama, Anala, Soma and
<div n="lb"/>Aryaman (10th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<Poem>“Manor hairaṇyagarbhasya
<div n="lb"/>ye marīcyādayaḥ sutāḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Teṣāmṛṣīṇāṃ sarveṣām
<div n="lb"/>putrāḥ pitṛgaṇāḥ smṛtāḥ” //

<div n="lb"/>Pitṛs (manes) are classified into two types: The Agni-
<div n="lb"/>ṣvāttas and Barhiṣadas. Of these the Agniṣvāttas do
<div n="lb"/>not perform Yāgas and the Barhiṣadas are those who
<div n="lb"/>perform yāgas. Besides these two major divisions they
<div n="lb"/>are classified into many other groups as follows:
<div n="NI"/>1. {%Somasadasya (s).%} Virāṭ Puruṣa is the creator of these
<div n="lb"/>Pitṛs. Somasadasyas are the Pitṛs of Sādhyadevas.
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Agniṣvātta (s).%} They are the pitṛs of devas.
<div n="NI"/>3. {%Barhiṣadas.%} These Pitṛs are the creation of the sage
<div n="lb"/>Atri. They are the manes of daityas, dānavas, yakṣas,
<div n="lb"/>gandharvas, uragas (serpents), rākṣasas (demons),
<div n="lb"/>suvarṇas and kinnaras.

<div n="NI"/>4. {%Somapā (s).%} They are the sons of the sage Bhṛgu and
<div n="lb"/>are the manes of brahmins.
<div n="NI"/>5. {%Havirbhuk (s).%} The sage Aṅgiras is the father of
<div n="lb"/>these Pitṛs who are the manes of Kṣatriyas.
<div n="NI"/>6. {%Ājyapā (s).%} These are the sons of the sage Pulastya
<div n="lb"/>and are the manes of Vaiśyas.
<div n="NI"/>7. {%Sukālika (s).%} Sons of the sage Vasiṣṭha, these Pitṛs
<div n="lb"/>are the manes of the Śūdras.
<div n="NI"/>To the seven sages like Marīci were born the pitṛs and
<div n="lb"/>to the pitṛs were born the devāsuras (devas and asuras)
<div n="lb"/>and to the devāsuras were born everything else in this
<div n="lb"/>universe, animate and inanimate. (Chapter 3, Manu-
<div n="lb"/>smṛti).
<div n="NI"/>Performing a Śrāddha (offering obsequial oblations
<div n="lb"/>to the departed) is just like a yajña. The oblations
<div n="lb"/>should be offered in either silver or silver cum copper
<div n="lb"/>pots. Viśvadevas are the guardians of the pitṛs. There-
<div n="lb"/>fore the oblations should be offered after worshipping
<div n="lb"/>the Viśvadevas first and then the pitṛs and then Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Śrāddha).
