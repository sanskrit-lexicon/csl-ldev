UPANIṢAD¦. The four Vedas are Ṛk, Yajus, Sāma and
<div n="lb"/>Atharva. Each of these four has a Brāhmaṇa (a treatise
<div n="lb"/>relating to prayer and sacrificial ceremony).
<div n="lb"/>Next come the Āraṇyakas (forest texts—writings meant
<div n="lb"/>for the forest-dwelling hermit) as appendices to the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas. Then come the Upaniṣads as appendices
<div n="lb"/>to the Āraṇyakas. These four classes of literary works
<div n="lb"/>(the Vedas, the Brāhmaṇas, the Āraṇyakas and the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads) constitute the Vedic literature proper. The
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyakas and the Upaniṣads are inseparably connected
<div n="lb"/>with each other. The Upaniṣads are called Vedāntas
<div n="lb"/>(the end of the Vedas). The bulk of these Vedāntas
<div n="lb"/>belong to different periods anterior to the Later Vedic
<div n="lb"/>Period. The students begin the study of Upaniṣads
<div n="lb"/>only after having completed the study of the Mantras
<div n="lb"/>(Vedic hymns) and the Brāhmaṇas (the ritual).

<div n="NI"/>The meaning of the word ‘Upaniṣad’ is that which is
<div n="lb"/>most near. Upa = near. ni = most. sad = exist.
<div n="lb"/>(or sit). The Upaniṣads can be called the Jñānakāṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>of the Vedas. They describe the nature of Brahman.
<div n="lb"/>The figure of the supreme Spirit (Brahman) exists in
<div n="lb"/>the Upaniṣads. Apparently the Upaniṣads are expla-
<div n="lb"/>nations of the mantras, but they are concerned more
<div n="lb"/>with the allegorical significations and the mystic mean-
<div n="lb"/>ings of the tattvas or essence, of the origin of life, the
<div n="lb"/>world, the soul, God etc. The Upaniṣads are the basis
<div n="lb"/>of the Ṣaḍ-darśanas, the six systems of philosophy.
<div n="lb"/>There are a large number of Upaniṣads. The most
<div n="lb"/>important among them are 108 in number.
