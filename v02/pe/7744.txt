UPANIṢAD¦. The four Vedas are Ṛk, Yajus, Sāma and
Atharva. Each of these four has a Brāhmaṇa (a treatise
relating to prayer and sacrificial ceremony).
Next come the Āraṇyakas (forest texts—writings meant
for the forest-dwelling hermit) as appendices to the
Brāhmaṇas. Then come the Upaniṣads as appendices
to the Āraṇyakas. These four classes of literary works
(the Vedas, the Brāhmaṇas, the Āraṇyakas and the
Upaniṣads) constitute the Vedic literature proper. The
Āraṇyakas and the Upaniṣads are inseparably connected
with each other. The Upaniṣads are called Vedāntas
(the end of the Vedas). The bulk of these Vedāntas
belong to different periods anterior to the Later Vedic
Period. The students begin the study of Upaniṣads
only after having completed the study of the Mantras
(Vedic hymns) and the Brāhmaṇas (the ritual).

<div n="NI"/>The meaning of the word ‘Upaniṣad’ is that which is
most near. Upa = near. ni = most. sad = exist.
(or sit). The Upaniṣads can be called the Jñānakāṇḍa
of the Vedas. They describe the nature of Brahman.
The figure of the supreme Spirit (Brahman) exists in
the Upaniṣads. Apparently the Upaniṣads are expla-
nations of the mantras, but they are concerned more
with the allegorical significations and the mystic mean-
ings of the tattvas or essence, of the origin of life, the
world, the soul, God etc. The Upaniṣads are the basis
of the Ṣaḍ-darśanas, the six systems of philosophy.
There are a large number of Upaniṣads. The most
important among them are 108 in number.
