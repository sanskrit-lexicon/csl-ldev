ASIKNI II¦. A wife of Dakṣa. Dakṣaprajāpati, son of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, commenced creation with his own mind. When
<div n="lb"/>he found that it was not conducive to the propagation
<div n="lb"/>of the species he pondered over the subject once more
<div n="lb"/>and decided to effect it by the sexual union of the male
<div n="lb"/>and the female. He, therefore, married Asikni daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Vīraṇaprajāpati. There is a version in the seventh
<div n="lb"/>Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata that Vīraṇī was born of
<div n="lb"/>the left thumb of Brahmā.
<F>*) It was Mahāviṣṇu who gave Dakṣa his wife, Asikni, when Dakṣa was doing penance in Vindhya. (Ṣaṣṭa Skandha, Bhāgavata).</F> Then the virile Dakṣa-
<div n="lb"/>prajāpati begot by Asikni five thousand Haryaśvas with
<div n="lb"/>a view to propagating his species and the Haryaśvas
<div n="lb"/>also evinced great desire to increase their number.
<div n="lb"/>Knowing this devarṣi Nārada of enchanting words
<div n="lb"/>approached them and said “Oh, Haryaśvas, I under-
<div n="lb"/>stand you, energetic young men, are going to continue
<div n="lb"/>creation. Phew! You are children who have not cared
<div n="lb"/>to understand the ins and outs or ups and downs of this
<div n="lb"/>earth and then how do you think you can create
<div n="lb"/>people? You are all endowed with the power to move
<div n="lb"/>about on all sides without any obstruction and you are
<div n="lb"/>only fools if you do not attempt so find out the limits
<div n="lb"/>of this earth”. Hearing this they started on a tour to
<div n="lb"/>different sides of the earth to find out its boundaries.
<div n="lb"/>Just like worms fallen into the ocean the Haryaśvas have
<div n="lb"/>never returned so far.
<div n="NI"/>When he found that the Haryaśvas were lost the mighty
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa begot in the daughter of Vīraṇī a thousand sons
<div n="lb"/>called Śabalāśvas. They were also desirous of propaga-
<div n="lb"/>tion but were also persuaded by the words of Nārada to
<div n="lb"/>follow the footsteps of their elder brothers. They dis-
<div n="lb"/>cussed it among themselves and said “The words of the
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi are right. We must also follow the course taken
<div n="lb"/>by our brothers. It is wise to commence creation after
[Page058-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>knowing the size of the earth.” They also went to
<div n="lb"/>different sides and never returned just like rivers falling
<div n="lb"/>into the ocean. The loss of the Śabalāśvas infuriated
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣa and he cursed Nārada.
<div n="NI"/>Again to commence creation Dakṣa got of Asikni sixty
<div n="lb"/>girls. Of these ten he gave to Dharmadeva, thirteen
<div n="lb"/>to Kaśyapa, twentyseven to Soma and four to Ariṣṭa-
<div n="lb"/>nemi. Two were given to Bahuputra, two to Aṅgiras
<div n="lb"/>and two to the scholar Kṛśāśva. Dharmadeva's wives
<div n="lb"/>were Arundhatī, Vasu, Yamī, Lambā, Bhānu, Marut-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, Saṅkalpā, Muhūrtā, Sādhyā and Viśvā. Of Viśvā
<div n="lb"/>were born Viśvedevas. Sādhya delivered the Sādhyas,
<div n="lb"/>Maruṭva, the Marutvans and Vasu, Vasus. Bhānus were
<div n="lb"/>born of Bhānu. From Muhūrta came Muhūrtābhimānis
<div n="lb"/>and from Lambā, Ghoṣa and from Yamī, Nāgavīthī.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 15, Anuśāsana Parva, 1; Viṣṇu Purāṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 6, Bhāgavata).
