NARMADĀ I¦. A famous holy river of South India. This
<div n="lb"/>river which springs from Amarakaṇṭaka flows through
<div n="lb"/>the valley called Khambhāta and falls into the ocean.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This river which is considered to be a holy
<div n="lb"/>river was the rebirth of Tapatī the daughter of the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>(To know how Tapatī was reborn as Narmadā, see under
<div n="lb"/>Tapatī).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The divine nature of the river Narmadā.%} Mention is
<div n="lb"/>made in most of the Purāṇas about the river Narmadā
<div n="lb"/>which is one of the holy rivers of Bhārata. Once Nārada
<div n="lb"/>said to Yudhiṣṭhira about the river Narmadā as follows:
<div n="lb"/>“Gaṅgā has more divinity in Kanakhala and Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>has more divinity in Kurukṣetra. But Narmadā is a holy
<div n="lb"/>river everywhere, whether in the villages or in the forests.
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī purifies us in three days and Gaṅgā in one day.
<div n="lb"/>But the moment we see Narmadā we are purified.”
<div n="NI"/>The river Narmadā, the former half of which embraces
<div n="lb"/>the mountain Amarakaṇṭaka in the country of
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga, is the purest of rivers in the three worlds. The
<div n="lb"/>devas, asuras, Gandharvas and hermits bathe in the
<div n="lb"/>river and attain eternal bliss. He who controls his
<div n="lb"/>organs of senses and takes fast for one night and bathes
<div n="lb"/>in this river would be prosperous for hundred generations.
<div n="lb"/>This great river is hundred yojanas long and two yojanas
<div n="lb"/>wide. There are sixty crores and sixty thousand holy
<div n="lb"/>ghats in this river around the mountain Amara-
<div n="lb"/>kaṇṭaka. Anybody who dies by fire, by drowning or by
<div n="lb"/>fast on this mountain Amarakaṇṭaka, will never have
<div n="lb"/>rebirth. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mahābhārata and Narmadā.%} Throughout Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata mention is made about Narmadā. Important of
<div n="lb"/>them are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Goddess Narmadā stays in the palace of Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>worshipping him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 9,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 18).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) While leading forest life Dharmaputra with his
<div n="lb"/>brothers visited Narmadādevī. (M.B. Vana Parva,

<div n="NI"/>(iii) Indra and the Aśvinīdevas once drank Soma
<div n="lb"/>sitting on the mountain Vaiḍūrya on the banks of the

<div n="lb"/>ful. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 2, Stanza 18).
