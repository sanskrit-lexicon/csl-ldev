NARMADĀ I¦. A famous holy river of South India. This
river which springs from Amarakaṇṭaka flows through
the valley called Khambhāta and falls into the ocean.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This river which is considered to be a holy
river was the rebirth of Tapatī the daughter of the Sun.
(To know how Tapatī was reborn as Narmadā, see under
Tapatī).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The divine nature of the river Narmadā.%} Mention is
made in most of the Purāṇas about the river Narmadā
which is one of the holy rivers of Bhārata. Once Nārada
said to Yudhiṣṭhira about the river Narmadā as follows:
“Gaṅgā has more divinity in Kanakhala and Sarasvatī
has more divinity in Kurukṣetra. But Narmadā is a holy
river everywhere, whether in the villages or in the forests.
Sarasvatī purifies us in three days and Gaṅgā in one day.
But the moment we see Narmadā we are purified.”
<div n="NI"/>The river Narmadā, the former half of which embraces
the mountain Amarakaṇṭaka in the country of
Kaliṅga, is the purest of rivers in the three worlds. The
devas, asuras, Gandharvas and hermits bathe in the
river and attain eternal bliss. He who controls his
organs of senses and takes fast for one night and bathes
in this river would be prosperous for hundred generations.
This great river is hundred yojanas long and two yojanas
wide. There are sixty crores and sixty thousand holy
ghats in this river around the mountain Amara-
kaṇṭaka. Anybody who dies by fire, by drowning or by
fast on this mountain Amarakaṇṭaka, will never have
rebirth. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mahābhārata and Narmadā.%} Throughout Mahā-
bhārata mention is made about Narmadā. Important of
