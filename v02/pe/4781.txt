NAUBANDHANA¦. A peak of the Himālayas. The peak
<div n="lb"/>came to be known by this name on account of the
<div n="lb"/>following cause. Once upon a time Hiraṇyakaśipu stole
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and with them hid in the bottom of the
<div n="lb"/>ocean. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated himself as fish to restore
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas. The world then was submerged in water
<div n="lb"/>and the maharṣis escaped in a boat attached to the
<div n="lb"/>horns of the Makara fish. On earth flood rose upto the
<div n="lb"/>peaks of the Himālayas. The Saptarṣis attached their
<div n="lb"/>boat to a peak of the mountain and that came to be
<div n="lb"/>known as Naubandhana. (nau = boat; bandha = tie).
<div n="lb"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 187, Verse 50).
