KĀLAKŪṬA¦. The virulent poison that came up
during the churning of the Ocean of Milk. Śiva swallow-
ed and retained it in his throat, and so he came to
be called Nīlakaṇṭha.
<div n="NI"/>“And Kālakūṭa arose like fire burning all the worlds.
The smell of it sent the three worlds into a swoon.
At the request of Brahmā Śiva swallowed the poison to
save the world from absolute destruction. And, he
(Śiva) retained it in his throat”. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 18).
