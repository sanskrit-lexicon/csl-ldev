MĀYĀVASIṢṬHA¦. There was once a King called Mitra-
<div n="lb"/>saha among the Kings of the Solar dynasty who ruled
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā. One day while he was hunting he saw two
<div n="lb"/>demons roaming about as tigers and Mitrasaha killed
<div n="lb"/>one of them. The other demon waited for an opportu-
<div n="lb"/>nity to wreak vengeance and an opportunity presented
<div n="lb"/>itself. Mitrasaha was conducting an Aśvamedha yāga to
<div n="lb"/>which Vasiṣṭha was the chief priest. The demon went
<div n="lb"/>to the King as Vasiṣṭha and privately told him that
<div n="lb"/>he desired to eat meat and the King accordingly pre-
<div n="lb"/>pared meat which was greatly resented by the real
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and the sage cursed Mitrasaha to become a
<div n="lb"/>demon. The false Vasiṣṭha who played the trick on the
<div n="lb"/>King is called Māyāvasiṣṭha. (See for details under
<div n="lb"/>Kalmāṣapāda).
