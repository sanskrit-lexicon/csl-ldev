PURĀṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The Amarakośa describes a
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa thus:
<Poem>Sargaśca pratisargaśca
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśo manvantarāṇi ca /
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśānucaritaṃ cāpi
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇam pañcalakṣaṇam //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>According to this definition, Purāṇa is one which des-
<div n="lb"/>cribes Sarga, Pratisarga, Vaṃśa, Manvantara and
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśānucarita. Among these Sarga and Pratisarga
<div n="lb"/>are natural creation and renovation (Cosmogony).
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśa means history of sages and patriarchs. By Man-
<div n="lb"/>vantara is meant the period of different Manus. Vaṃśā-
<div n="lb"/>nucarita means Genealogy of kings. In the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>which are current now some of these five divisions are
<div n="lb"/>wanting.
<div n="NI"/>Statements about Purāṇas are found even in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas. Therefore it is to be surmised that Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>existed even before historic times. Mahābhārata has
<div n="lb"/>used the term Purāṇa to mean stories about devas and
<div n="lb"/>siddhas. The Upaniṣads say that Purāṇas are itihāsas
<div n="lb"/>and as such constitute the fifth Veda. Smṛti says
<div n="lb"/>that Purāṇas are commentaries on Vedas. From all
<div n="lb"/>these statements it can be gathered that Purāṇas have
<div n="lb"/>a hoary past. The great Sanskrit scholar Raṅgācārya
<div n="lb"/>has defined Purāṇa as Purā nava (Purā=old; nava
<div n="lb"/>=new) meaning things which are as good as new
<div n="lb"/>though existing from olden times. Though there are
<div n="lb"/>large portions of wide imagination dealing with the
<div n="lb"/>human side in the Purāṇas many truths about the
<div n="lb"/>universe can be grasped from them. All the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>contain praises of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara. In
<div n="lb"/>most of the Purāṇas of old, new additions and interpo-
<div n="lb"/>lations are seen. The Purāṇas in original were in exis-
<div n="lb"/>tence before Christ.
<Poem>Ākhyānaiścāpyupākhyānair
<div n="lb"/>Gāthābhiḥ Kalpaśuddhibhiḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇasaṃhitāṃ cakre
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇārthaviśāradaḥ //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 15, Chapter 6, Aṃśa 3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa)
<Poem>Aṣṭādaśa Purāṇāni
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtvā Satyavatīsutaḥ /
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratākhyānamakhilaṃ
<div n="lb"/>Cakre tadupabṛṃhaṇam //</Poem>
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 70, Chapter 53, Matsya Purāṇa)
<div n="NI"/>From the above it can be gathered that it was Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>who composed all the Purāṇas. Bāṇa who lived in the
<div n="lb"/>seventh century A.D. speaks about Vāyu Purāṇa. Kumā-
<div n="lb"/>rila Bhaṭṭa who lived in the eighth century and Śaṅkarā-
<div n="lb"/>cārya who lived in the ninth century speak about the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas. Purāṇas must have therefore taken their pre-
<div n="lb"/>sent forms before the sixth or seventh century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>There are eighteen major Purāṇas and another eighteen
<div n="lb"/>minor ones. The major Purāṇas contain over four lakhs
<div n="lb"/>of Ślokas. All the Purāṇas are in verses like Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata. But none of them is as good as Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>as a piece of literature. Still the Purāṇas splendidly
<div n="lb"/>reflect the culture of Bhārata. The Purāṇas are the
<div n="lb"/>basis of the bulk of Indian thinking on matters
<div n="lb"/>social, cultural, religious and political. Even the Indian
<div n="lb"/>art has taken form from the Purāṇas. The Purāṇas are
<div n="lb"/>classified into three, those pertaining to Brahmā, those
<div n="lb"/>pertaining to Viṣṇu and those to Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%A. Viṣṇu-based Purānas.%}
[Page617-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Viṣṇu Purāṇa.%} This is one of the most important of
<div n="lb"/>all the Purāṇas. This contains the five technical
<div n="lb"/>divisions of the Purāṇas. This is divided into six aṃśas.
<div n="lb"/>This deals with the events of Vārāhakalpa and contains
<div n="lb"/>twentythree thousand ślokas. The theme is the ten
<div n="lb"/>incarnations of Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu Purāṇa is the most
<div n="lb"/>ancient of all the Purāṇas and has got the name
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇaratna (gem of Purāṇas).
<div n="NI"/>The method of narration is in the form of teaching
<div n="lb"/>his disciple Maitreya by sage Parāśara. Since
<div n="lb"/>there is a reference in it to the Maurya dynasty it is to
<div n="lb"/>be surmised that this was composed in the first or second
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. The narrator himself states thus:—
<div n="lb"/>“Vyāsa an adept in the composition of Purāṇas composed
<div n="lb"/>this Purāṇasaṃhitā with ākhyānas, Upākhyānas, gāthās
<div n="lb"/>and Kalpanirṇayas. A Sūta named Romaharṣaṇa was
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa's chief disciple. The broad-minded Vyāsa gave
<div n="lb"/>that saṃhitā to that sūta. Romaharṣaṇa had six dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciples named Sumati, Agnivarcas, Mitrāyus. Śāṃśapā-
<div n="lb"/>yana, Akṛtavraṇa, and Sāvarṇi. Of these Akṛtavraṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi and Śāṃśapāyana born in the Kaśyapagotra
<div n="lb"/>have composed Purāṇasaṃhitās. There is yet another
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā composed by Romaharṣaṇa which was the basis
<div n="lb"/>of the saṃhitās of his three disciples. I have composed
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇupurāṇa basing on the above four saṃhitās.”
<div n="NI"/>If a man gives as gift a book of Viṣṇu Purāṇa on
<div n="lb"/>the full moon day in the month of āṣāḍha (July) with
<div n="lb"/>Jaladhenu he will attain Viṣṇupāda.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Bhāgavata Purāṇa.%} This is the most popular and
<div n="lb"/>widely circulated of all the Purāṇas. It is dear to
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu-devotees. Divided into twelve Skandhas this con-
<div n="lb"/>tains eighteen thousand ślokas. All the incarnations of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu are described in this. The most interesting
<div n="lb"/>Skandha is the tenth Skandha in which the author has
<div n="lb"/>described the life and activities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There
<div n="lb"/>was once a belief that it was Baladeva who lived in the
<div n="lb"/>thirteenth century A.D. that had composed this Purāṇa.
<div n="lb"/>But this belief was smashed when it was found that Vallā-
<div n="lb"/>lasena of Bengal who lived in the eleventh century A.D.
<div n="lb"/>had made references to this Purāṇa in some of his works.
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata accepts Kapila and Buddha as incarnations
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu. This has been translated into all Indian
<div n="lb"/>languages. This book has to be given as gift on the full-
<div n="lb"/>moon day in the month of Proṣṭhapada (September).
<div n="lb"/>Agni Purāṇa instructs that this book is to be given
<div n="lb"/>along with a golden image of a lion.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Nāradīya Purāṇa.%} This is in the form of a
<div n="lb"/>narration by Nārada to Sanatkumāra. In this book of
<div n="lb"/>twentyfive thousand verses Nārada teaches the dharmas
<div n="lb"/>of Bṛhatkalpa. If this is given as gift on the full-moon
<div n="lb"/>day in the month of Āśvina there will be great pros-
<div n="lb"/>perity.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Garuḍa Purāṇa.%} This is in the form of instructions
<div n="lb"/>to Garuḍa by Viṣṇu. This deals with astronomy,
<div n="lb"/>medicine, grammar, and with the structure and qualities
<div n="lb"/>of diamonds. This Purāṇa is dear to Vaiṣṇavites. The
<div n="lb"/>latter half of this Purāṇa deals with life after death.
<div n="lb"/>The Hindus of north-India generally read this Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>while cremating the bodies of the dead. This has given
<div n="lb"/>great importance to the origin of Garuḍa. There are
<div n="lb"/>eight thousand verses in this book. This book should be
<div n="lb"/>given as gift along with an image in gold of a swan to
<div n="lb"/>get prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Padma Purāṇa (Pādma Purāṇa).%} This book is
<div n="lb"/>divided into six Khaṇḍas comprising fiftyfive thousand
[Page618-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>verses. The six Khaṇḍas are Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa, Bhūmi-
<div n="lb"/>khaṇḍa, Svargakhaṇḍa, Pātālakhaṇḍa, Uttarakhaṇḍa
<div n="lb"/>and Kriyāyogasāra. The Uttarakhaṇḍa describes
<div n="lb"/>the importance of all months and also the lotus, the
<div n="lb"/>seat of Brahmā. This contains the stories of Śakuntalā
<div n="lb"/>and Śrī Rāma as described by Kālidāsa in his works
<div n="lb"/>Śākuntala and Raghuvaṃśa which has made some
<div n="lb"/>believe that this Purāṇa was written after Kālidāsa.
<div n="lb"/>If this Purāṇa is given as gift with a cow in the month
<div n="lb"/>of Jyeṣṭha (June) it brings prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Varāha Purāṇa.%} The mode of narration is in the
<div n="lb"/>form of narrating the story by Varāha, the third incar-
<div n="lb"/>nation of Viṣṇu. The theme is about holy places and
<div n="lb"/>mantras. It states that the goddess of earth prayed to
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu and that prayer took the form of a goddess.
<div n="lb"/>This book contains fourteen thousand verses. If one
<div n="lb"/>copies down this Purāṇa and gives it as gift along with
<div n="lb"/>a golden image of Garuḍa on the full-moon day in the
<div n="lb"/>month of Caitra (April) one will attain Viṣṇuloka.
<div n="NI"/>{%B. Purāṇas relating to Brahmā.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Brahma Purāṇa.%} This is in the form of teachings by
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā to Dakṣa. This contains twentyfive thousand
<div n="lb"/>verses. This is called Ādi Purāṇa also. There is a special
<div n="lb"/>treatise in this book on Orissa, an ancient holy region
<div n="lb"/>of Bhārata. There is in this a special annexure explain-
<div n="lb"/>ing the intimacy between Śiva and Sūrya which is a
<div n="lb"/>deviation from other Purāṇas. Brahma Purāṇa states
<div n="lb"/>about a sūryakṣetra (sun-temple) situated at a place
<div n="lb"/>called Koṇārka near the holy place of Purī, installed
<div n="lb"/>there in the year 1241 A.D. If this Purāṇa along with
<div n="lb"/>Jaladhenu is given as a gift on the full-moon day in the
<div n="lb"/>month of Vaiśākha (May) the donor will attain heaven.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa.%} This deals with the origin of
<div n="lb"/>the universe as told by Brahmā. In the beginning
<div n="lb"/>there was a golden egg and the prapañca (universe with
<div n="lb"/>its activities) was formed out of it. Portions of Adh-
<div n="lb"/>yātma Rāmāyaṇa, references to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>the incarnation of Paraśurāma are included in this.
<div n="lb"/>This book contains twelve thousand verses and it is
<div n="lb"/>believed to be uttama (best) to give this book as a gift
<div n="lb"/>to a brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa.%} This was instructed to
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇika by Nārada. The theme is the story of
<div n="lb"/>Rathantara. There are four kāṇḍas in this Purāṇa called
<div n="lb"/>Brahmakāṇḍa, Prakṛtikāṇḍa, Gaṇeśakāṇḍa and Kṛṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>janmakāṇḍa. This deals with Prapañcasṛṣṭi (creation
<div n="lb"/>of the universe). It says that Prapañca is nothing
<div n="lb"/>but the Vaivartta (transformation) of Brahman. It is
<div n="lb"/>considered to be holy to give this book containing eighteen
<div n="lb"/>thousand verses as a gift on the full-moon day in the
<div n="lb"/>month of Māgha (February).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa.%} This is one of the ancient
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas. There are many stories regarding Indra,
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya and Agni in this. This includes a division called
<div n="lb"/>Devīmāhātmya containing praises about the goddess
<div n="lb"/>Durgā. This contains nine thousand verses and it is
<div n="lb"/>considered as uttama (best) to give this book as a gift
<div n="lb"/>to a brahmin on a full-moon day in the month of
<div n="lb"/>Kārttika (November).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Bhaviṣya Purāṇa.%} This is what is told to Manu by
<div n="lb"/>Sūrya (Sun). This contains statements about future
<div n="lb"/>events. The book praises the worship of Sūrya (Sun),
<div n="lb"/>Agni (fire) and Nāga (serpent). There is an annexure
<div n="lb"/>dealing with the several holy places of Bhārata and the
[Page618-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>rights of pilgrims. The book contains fourteen thousand
<div n="lb"/>verses and it is considered to be uttama (best) to give
<div n="lb"/>this book along with treacle as a gift to a brahmin on
<div n="lb"/>the full-moon day in the month of Pauṣa (January).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Vāmana Purāṇa.%} There is a great similarity between
<div n="lb"/>the contents of this Purāṇa and that of Varāha Purāṇa.
<div n="lb"/>All the incarnations of Viṣṇu from Vāmana downwards
<div n="lb"/>are described in this Purāṇa. The scene of Śiva marry-
<div n="lb"/>ing Pārvatī is vividly described in this book. This
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa contains ten thousand verses and it is considered
<div n="lb"/>to be uttama (best) to give this book as a gift in the
<div n="lb"/>autumn season or at the time of Viṣuva to a brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>{%C. Purāṇas relating to Śiva.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Vāyu Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa is told by Vāyu. Bāṇa-
<div n="lb"/>bhaṭṭa who lived in the seventh century A.D. makes
<div n="lb"/>references to this Purāṇa in his works. There are many
<div n="lb"/>references in this Purāṇa about the Gupta Kings who
<div n="lb"/>ruled Bhārata in the 4th century A.D. So it is believed
<div n="lb"/>that this Purāṇa must have been written in the fifth or
<div n="lb"/>sixth century A.D The book contains plenty of verses
<div n="lb"/>in praise of Śiva. There are fourteen thousand verses in
<div n="lb"/>the Vāyu Purāṇa and it is considered to be best to give
<div n="lb"/>this book as a gift to a brahmin on the full-moon day
<div n="lb"/>in the month of Śrāvaṇa (August).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Liṅga Purāṇa.%} This contains instructions of Śiva on
<div n="lb"/>Dharma sitting in the form of liṅga (Phallus). The
<div n="lb"/>twentyeight different forms of Śiva are described in
<div n="lb"/>this. This contains twelve thousand verses and if this
<div n="lb"/>book is given as a gift to a brahmin with tiladhenu on
<div n="lb"/>the full-moon day in the month of Phālguna (March)
<div n="lb"/>the donor will attain Śivasāyujya.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Skānda Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa is narrated by
<div n="lb"/>Skanda. The theme is the slaughter of the demon
<div n="lb"/>Tārakāsura by Skanda (Subrahmaṇya). There is a
<div n="lb"/>great similarity between this Purāṇa and the Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>sambhava of Kālidāsa. There are eightyfour thousand
<div n="lb"/>verses in this Purāṇa and giving this book as a gift is
<div n="lb"/>thought to be good.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Agni Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa was instructed to the
<div n="lb"/>sage Vasiṣṭha by Agnideva. There are several refer-
<div n="lb"/>ences in this to Śivaliṅga and Durgādevī. The incarna-
<div n="lb"/>tions of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa are also dealt with in this.
<div n="lb"/>Distinct from other Purāṇas this book deals with arts
<div n="lb"/>and science like Kavyālaṅkāranāṭakas (Poems, dramas,
<div n="lb"/>figures of speech), Jyotiśsāstra (Astronomy) and Śilpa-
<div n="lb"/>kalā (architecture). This Purāṇa contains twelve
<div n="lb"/>thousand verses and is capable of imparting knowledge
<div n="lb"/>on all arts and sciences.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Matsya Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa was taught to Manu
<div n="lb"/>by Matsya, the incarnation of Viṣṇu, The incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Matsya is dealt in this. Several subjects like Jaina-
<div n="lb"/>mata (religion of Jainism), Buddhamata (Buddhism),
<div n="lb"/>Nāṭyaśāstra (histrionics) and Āndhrarājavaṃsa (king-
<div n="lb"/>dom and Kings of Āndhra) are discussed in this book.
<div n="lb"/>The book contains thirteen thousand verses and this is
<div n="lb"/>to be given as gift along with a golden image of a fish
<div n="lb"/>at the time of Viṣuva.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Kūrma Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa is taught by Kūrma-
<div n="lb"/>mūrti (incarnation of Viṣṇu as Kūrma (tortoise) while
<div n="lb"/>narrating the story of Indradyumna at Pātāla. All the
<div n="lb"/>seven islands and seven oceans are described in this
<div n="lb"/>book. Bhārata is situated in the centre of all these and
<div n="lb"/>is called Jambūdvīpa. Though it is believed that there
<div n="lb"/>were four saṃhitās for this, only the Brāhmasaṃhitā is
<div n="lb"/>available now. It includes Īśvaragītā and Vyāsagītā.
[Page619-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>The book contains eight thousand verses and is to be
