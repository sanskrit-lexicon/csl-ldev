DEVAHŪTĪ¦. A daughter of Svāyambhuva Manu, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Brahmā. The Manu had two sons called Priya-
<div n="lb"/>vrata and Uttānapāda and three daughters named
<div n="lb"/>Ākūti, Devahūti and Prasūti. Ākūti was married by
<div n="lb"/>Ruciprajāpati and Devahūti by Kardamaprajāpati
<div n="lb"/>and Prasūti to Dakṣprajāpati. Kapila, the mighty
<div n="lb"/>exponent of the Sāṅkhya system of philosophy and great
<div n="lb"/>ascetic was the son born to Kardama by Devahūti.
<div n="lb"/>Kapila taught his mother the world famous Kapila
<div n="lb"/>Śāstra, (Devibhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha) and when the
<div n="lb"/>teaching was over he bade farewell to her and took to
<div n="lb"/>forest life. And, his mother performed a yajña on the
<div n="lb"/>lines advised by her son, on the banks of river Sarasvatī.
<div n="lb"/>Because she took three baths daily her hairs became a
<div n="lb"/>mixture of black and blue in colour and she got emacia-
<div n="lb"/>ted due to fasting. She wore the bark of trees. Deva-
<div n="lb"/>hūti, who realised all the principles and the truth be-
<div n="lb"/>came blind to all external objects like gardens, maids,
<div n="lb"/>mansions etc. Thus immersed in meditation she in
<div n="lb"/>course of time attained siddhi (realisation). The parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular spot on the banks of Sarasvatī where she attained
<div n="lb"/>Siddhi is called Siddhapada.
