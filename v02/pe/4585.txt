MṚTYU¦. The goddess of Death. Agni Purāṇa gives
<div n="lb"/>details about the birth of Death. Hiṃsā was the wife
<div n="lb"/>of Adharma. They got a son named Anṛta and a
<div n="lb"/>daughter named Nikṛti. From them were born Bhaya,
[Page506-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Naraka, Māyā and Vedanā. Of these Māyā gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to Mṛtyu, the destroyer of matter.
<div n="NI"/>Mṛtyu has been described both as a god and goddess
<div n="lb"/>in Mahābhārata. The statements regarding Mṛtyu as
<div n="lb"/>a deva are as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) Three sons were born to Nikṛti, wife of Adharma.
<div n="lb"/>One of them was Mṛtyu. Mṛtyudeva has neither wife
<div n="lb"/>nor children because he is the destroyer of all. (Śloka
<div n="lb"/>54, Chapter 66, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once the son of an old Gautamī was bitten by a
<div n="lb"/>snake. A hunter seeing it rushed to kill the serpent
<div n="lb"/>but Gautamī objected to it. She advised him that it
<div n="lb"/>was a sin to injure any living being. The serpent then
<div n="lb"/>said, “It is not my fault that I bit the boy. I was
<div n="lb"/>persuaded by the god of death to do so.” The god of
<div n="lb"/>death Mṛtyudeva also appeared there then. He con-
<div n="lb"/>firmed the snake's statement and added that God had
<div n="lb"/>programmed all events beforehand and the boy's
<div n="lb"/>death was not due to any mistake on anybody's part.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 50, Chapter 1, Anuśāsana Parva)
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once Mṛtyu followed the King Sudarśana, but
<div n="lb"/>Mṛtyudeva had to withdraw after accepting defeat
<div n="lb"/>because the King had been living a virtuous life of high
<div n="lb"/>standard. (See under Sudarśana).
<div n="NI"/>The statements regarding Mṛtyu as a goddess are the
<div n="lb"/>following:
<div n="NI"/>(1) This devatā was born from the body of Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>in the shape of a woman. (Śloka 17, Chapter 53,
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Brahmā gave the work of destruction to Mṛtyu.
<div n="lb"/>When she got that work she wept aloud. (Śloka 21.
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 257, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) The goddess of Mṛtyu once did severe penance.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 17, Chapter 54, Droṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Brahmā assured the goddess of death that any
<div n="lb"/>destruction by her would not be deemed as a sin.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 44, Chapter 54, Droṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) The terrible strength of Mṛtyudevatā is described
<div n="lb"/>in Chapter 819, Śānti Parva, Mahābhārata.
