KRAMAPĀṬHA¦. A method of teaching the Vedas. It
<div n="lb"/>is due to the insistence on strict adherence to this
<div n="lb"/>method of teaching that even after thousands of years
<div n="lb"/>variations have not crept into the original texts of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas which form the earliest literature. There is a
<div n="lb"/>portion called ‘word study’ (Pada Pāṭha) in the Vedas
<div n="lb"/>(the scripture). Every word in the Veda is separated
<div n="lb"/>from its prefixes and suffixes. The second step is Krama-
<div n="lb"/>pāṭha or the study of joining prefixes and suffixes to
<div n="lb"/>each word got by the first step. Next step is Jaṭāpāṭha
<div n="lb"/>in which words are combined with their prefixes and
<div n="lb"/>suffixes. To guard against the creeping in of mistakes
<div n="lb"/>in this step, the next step which is known as Ghana-
<div n="lb"/>pāṭha is taught. In this step the first step of Padapāṭha
<div n="lb"/>and the second step of Krama pāṭha are mixed together
[Page416-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and intermingled from beginning to end and end to
<div n="lb"/>beginning. There are rules to make combined words by
<div n="lb"/>using prefixes and suffixes. These rules are called
<div n="lb"/>Prātiśākhya. Because the Vedas are taught in this way
<div n="lb"/>with so much attention and care, their texts have never
<div n="lb"/>been subjected to changes and variations.
