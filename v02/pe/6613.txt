<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} It is assumed in the Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>that this river is a branch of the heavenly Gaṅgā. By
<div n="lb"/>the efforts of Bhagīratha, the heavenly Gaṅgā fell on
<div n="lb"/>the earth in the Lake Bindu. After that it had six
<div n="lb"/>channels. Three channels flowed to the east and three
<div n="lb"/>to the west. The rivers which flowed to the East were
<div n="lb"/>Hlādinī, Pāvanī and Nalinī. The three rivers Sucakṣus,
<div n="lb"/>Sītā and Sindhu flowed to the west. This seventh branch
<div n="lb"/>followed Bhagīratha and flowed to Pātāla to perform
<div n="lb"/>obsequies to the sons of Sagara.
