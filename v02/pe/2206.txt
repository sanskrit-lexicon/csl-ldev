DUṢPAṆYA¦. Last son of a merchant in Pāṭalīputra.
<div n="lb"/>Short-tempered and haughty, this Duṣpaṇya killed many
<div n="lb"/>children. The King outlawed him. He went into the
<div n="lb"/>forest where he drowned the child of maharṣi Ugraśravas
<div n="lb"/>The maharṣi cursed him that he also should end his life
<div n="lb"/>by drowning and his soul roam about in unsupportable
<div n="lb"/>distress. The curse came true. After roaming about for
<div n="lb"/>many years he approached Agastya and prayed for
<div n="lb"/>redemption from the curse. The sage directed his dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciple, Sutīkṣṇa to get holy water from Agnitīrtha in
<div n="lb"/>Mount Gandhamādana and sprinkle it on the sinful
<div n="lb"/>soul of Duṣpaṇya. Sutīkṣṇa did as he was asked by the
<div n="lb"/>guru, and the soul of Duṣpaṇya attained salvation.
<div n="lb"/>(Setumāhātmyam).
