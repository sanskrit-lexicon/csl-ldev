<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The temples of India are
<div n="lb"/>reflections of the outward form or body of man. As
<div n="lb"/>the soul lives in the body of man, God dwells in the
<div n="lb"/>temples. The stone, rock, marble, metals etc. are equal
<div n="lb"/>to the bones of the body of a man.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Two types of temples.%} Temples are of two types.
<div n="lb"/>One type is the Grāmadevatā temples. These are
<div n="lb"/>temples in which goddess Bhadrakālī is consecrated
<div n="lb"/>and worshipped for the protection of villages and
<div n="lb"/>cities. The second type is of special temples. These are
<div n="lb"/>temples specially meant for a particular god or
<div n="lb"/>goddess. Thus there are temples for Viṣṇu, Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati and so on.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Grāmadevatā temples.%} Worship of Bhadrakālī existed
<div n="lb"/>in India from very early times. When Mohanjodaro
<div n="lb"/>and Harappa were excavated idols of Devī (goddess)
<div n="lb"/>more than 4000 years old, were obtained from there.
<div n="lb"/>During the prevalence of Buddhism in India the
<div n="lb"/>goddesses Yaksī and Hāritī were worshipped in
<div n="lb"/>India. Later when Hinduism was revived these
<div n="lb"/>goddesses took their places in it as the goddesses of
<div n="lb"/>Hindu Purāṇas and epics. The Kālī temples of Ujja-
<div n="lb"/>yinī and Calcutta are famous. In the Cidambara
<div n="lb"/>temple also the main deity is Kālī. The legend is that
<div n="lb"/>Paramaśiva defeated Kālī in a dance. In Mysore
<div n="lb"/>Cāmuṇḍī (Kālī) is worshipped as chief goddess or
<div n="lb"/>family goddess. Kāmākṣī in Kāñcī, Mīnākṣī in Madura
<div n="lb"/>(South India), Mūkāmbikā in North Karṇāṭaka and
<div n="lb"/>so on are the gentle and peaceful forms of Kālī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Devas (gods).%} In many of the temples in South
<div n="lb"/>India, Munīśvaran and Karuppan are the grāma-
<div n="lb"/>devatās (village gods). In some places Bhairava also is
<div n="lb"/>worshipped as grāmadevatā. In certain other places
<div n="lb"/>Vīran, Irulan, Kāreṭṭi, Noṇḍi and Pañcaruli
<div n="lb"/>are worshipped. Śāstā or Ayyappan has a prominent
<div n="lb"/>place among the village gods. Importance is attached
<div n="lb"/>to Śāstā or Ayyappan mostly in Kerala and Tamil
<div n="lb"/>Nāḍu.
