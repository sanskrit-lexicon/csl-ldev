KṢETRA¦ (S). Sacred spots. In Malayālam it means
Temples also.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The temples of India are
reflections of the outward form or body of man. As
the soul lives in the body of man, God dwells in the
temples. The stone, rock, marble, metals etc. are equal
to the bones of the body of a man.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Two types of temples.%} Temples are of two types.
One type is the Grāmadevatā temples. These are
temples in which goddess Bhadrakālī is consecrated
and worshipped for the protection of villages and
cities. The second type is of special temples. These are
temples specially meant for a particular god or
goddess. Thus there are temples for Viṣṇu, Śiva,
Gaṇapati and so on.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Grāmadevatā temples.%} Worship of Bhadrakālī existed
in India from very early times. When Mohanjodaro
and Harappa were excavated idols of Devī (goddess)
more than 4000 years old, were obtained from there.
During the prevalence of Buddhism in India the
goddesses Yaksī and Hāritī were worshipped in
India. Later when Hinduism was revived these
goddesses took their places in it as the goddesses of
Hindu Purāṇas and epics. The Kālī temples of Ujja-
yinī and Calcutta are famous. In the Cidambara
temple also the main deity is Kālī. The legend is that
Paramaśiva defeated Kālī in a dance. In Mysore
Cāmuṇḍī (Kālī) is worshipped as chief goddess or
family goddess. Kāmākṣī in Kāñcī, Mīnākṣī in Madura
(South India), Mūkāmbikā in North Karṇāṭaka and
so on are the gentle and peaceful forms of Kālī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Devas (gods).%} In many of the temples in South
India, Munīśvaran and Karuppan are the grāma-
devatās (village gods). In some places Bhairava also is
worshipped as grāmadevatā. In certain other places
Vīran, Irulan, Kāreṭṭi, Noṇḍi and Pañcaruli
are worshipped. Śāstā or Ayyappan has a prominent
place among the village gods. Importance is attached
to Śāstā or Ayyappan mostly in Kerala and Tamil
Nāḍu.
