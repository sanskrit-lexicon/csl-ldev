<div n="lb"/>Āyodhadhaumya. To know how Āruṇi got the name

<div n="NI"/>It is stated in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 12 that this hermit Uddālaka was a prominent
<div n="lb"/>figure in the Durbar of Indra. Uddālaka had a son cal-
<div n="lb"/>led Śvetaketu and a daughter called Sujātā. He gave
<div n="lb"/>his daughter Sujātā in marriage to his favourite disci-
<div n="lb"/>ple Kahoḍaka. The hermit Aṣṭāvakra was their son. See

<div n="lb"/>Once Uddālaka caused the river Sarasvatī to appear at
<div n="lb"/>the place of sacrifice. From that day onwards Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>got the name ‘Manoramā’ because when the thought
<div n="lb"/>came to his mind (manas) the river made its appearance.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 33). It is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 57, Stanza 10, that
<div n="lb"/>Uddālaka expelled his son Śvetaketu from the house be-
<div n="lb"/>cause the son was a hater of Brahmins.
