UDDĀLAKA I¦. A disciple called Āruṇi of the teacher
Āyodhadhaumya. To know how Āruṇi got the name
Uddālaka, see under Āyodhadhaumya.
<div n="NI"/>It is stated in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 7,
Stanza 12 that this hermit Uddālaka was a prominent
figure in the Durbar of Indra. Uddālaka had a son cal-
led Śvetaketu and a daughter called Sujātā. He gave
his daughter Sujātā in marriage to his favourite disci-
ple Kahoḍaka. The hermit Aṣṭāvakra was their son. See
under Aṣṭāvakra. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 132).
Once Uddālaka caused the river Sarasvatī to appear at
the place of sacrifice. From that day onwards Sarasvatī
got the name ‘Manoramā’ because when the thought
came to his mind (manas) the river made its appearance.
(M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 33). It is mentioned in
Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 57, Stanza 10, that
Uddālaka expelled his son Śvetaketu from the house be-
cause the son was a hater of Brahmins.
