BARBARIKA¦. Son of Maurvī born of Ghaṭotkaca, son
of Bhīma. Skanda Purāṇa gives the following details
about him.
<div n="NI"/>Barbarika was a Yakṣa in his previous life. Once the
devas unable to bear the insufferable harm done to
them by the Dānavas approached Lord Mahāviṣṇu for
help and then the Yakṣa who was present there at that
time said with arrogance, “There is no need for Viṣṇu
to curb the activities of the Dānavas. I shall do it my-
self.” Hearing those arrogant words Brahmā cursed
him saying that in his next life he would be killed by
Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>True to the curse the Yakṣa was born in his next life
as Barbarika, son of Ghaṭotkaca. To lessen the force of
the curse Kṛṣṇa advised him to worship Devī. At last
pleasing the goddess by the kindly help of a brahmin
named Vijaya Barbarika killed a demoness called
Mahājihva and a demon of name Repalendra. The
brāhmin further gave him a weapon named Vibhūti
which could split the vital centres of the body of an
enemy and said, “Use this weapon against the Kaura-
vas who oppose the Pāṇḍavas.”
<div n="NI"/>Once Barbarika defeated his grandfather Bhīma in a
battle and greatly grieved over the injury done started
to commit suicide. Then Devī appeared before him and
reminded him thus, “You will get salvation only if you
are killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa and so desist from committing
suicide.”
[Page108-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>The great war started and Barbarika fighting on the
side of the Pāṇḍavas started using his weapon Vibhūti.
He sent it against all excepting the Pāṇḍavas, Kṛpā-
cārya and Aśvatthāmā. He did not leave even Kṛṣṇa
alone and the weapon fell on the feet of Kṛṣṇa also.
Enraged at this Kṛṣṇa used his Sudarśana Cakra and
cut off his head; at once Devī appeared and brought
him to life. After the great battle on the advice of
Kṛṣṇa Barbarika went and lived in Guptakṣetra.
