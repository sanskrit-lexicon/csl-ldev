URVAŚĪ I¦. A famous celestial damsel.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth of Urvaśī.%} In days of old two hermits named Nara
<div n="lb"/>and Nārāyaṇa did penance to Brahmā in the holy her-
<div n="lb"/>mitage of Badarikā for a thousand years. (Nara and
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa were the children born to Dharma, the son of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā). Because of the severity of their penance Indra
<div n="lb"/>was struck with fear. Thinking that they were doing
<div n="lb"/>this severe penance with a view to become Indra, he
<div n="lb"/>approached the hermits and told them that they might
<div n="lb"/>ask for any boon. Even though Indra told them several
<div n="lb"/>times, they did not speak a word nor did they make any
<div n="lb"/>stir. Indra's fear increased. So Indra decided to create
<div n="lb"/>some delusions which would arouse in them fear, desire
<div n="lb"/>etc., so that their penance might be broken. He began
<div n="lb"/>to bring around them wild animals such as lion, elephant
<div n="lb"/>wild snake etc. and natural phenomena such as storm,
[Page811-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>heavy rain, forest-fire etc. to terrify them. The efforts
<div n="lb"/>of Indra were futile. The disappointed Indra sent for
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadeva (Cupid) and consulted him, as a result of
<div n="lb"/>which Kāmadeva and his wife Ratidevī with many
<div n="lb"/>celestial maids came to the hermitage in the mountain
<div n="lb"/>of Gandhamādana with the intention of hindering the
<div n="lb"/>penance of Naranārāyaṇas. The season of spring was
<div n="lb"/>created in the forest. The celestial women such as
<div n="lb"/>Rambhā and others came before the hermits and began
<div n="lb"/>to sing and dance. The hearts of the hermits began to
<div n="lb"/>swell with passion. When they opened their eyes what
<div n="lb"/>they saw was a beautiful sight. The famous celestial
<div n="lb"/>women, Menakā, Rambhā, Tilottamā, Sukeśinī, Mano-
<div n="lb"/>ramā, Maheśvarī, Puṣpagandhā, Pramadvarā, Ghṛtācī,
<div n="lb"/>Candraprabhā, Somā, Vidyunmālā, Ambujākṣī, Kāñca-
<div n="lb"/>namālā, and others with their ten thousand and eighty
<div n="lb"/>hand-maids stood before them. Hermit Nārāyaṇa who
<div n="lb"/>got terribly angry struck on his thigh with his hand
<div n="lb"/>and instantly there arose a woman of extreme beauty.
<div n="lb"/>Because she had originated from the Ūru (thigh) of
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa, that woman, who was the most beautiful
<div n="lb"/>in the three worlds, got the name Urvaśī. All the others
<div n="lb"/>were struck with wonder at the sight of this new creat-
<div n="lb"/>ion. After that so many other beautiful women also
<div n="lb"/>were created. The hermit Nārāyaṇa gave all of them
<div n="lb"/>to Indra. With shame Indra accepted them and return-
<div n="lb"/>ed to heaven along with them. Thus Urvaśī arrived
<div n="lb"/>at the realm of the devas (gods). (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Position of Urvaśī.%} It is mentioned in Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>that Urvaśī had the eleventh place among the singers.
<div n="lb"/>The expert dancers were Anūcānā, Adrikā, Somakeśī,
<div n="lb"/>Miśrā, Alambuṣā, Marīci, Śucikā, Vidyutparṇā, Tilot-
<div n="lb"/>tamā, Ambikā, Kṣemā, Rambhā, Subāhu, Asitā,
<div n="lb"/>Supriyā, Puṇḍarīkā, Sugandhā, Surasā, Pramāthinī,
<div n="lb"/>Kāmyā and Śāradvatī. Urvaśī got the first place among
<div n="lb"/>the celestial maids in beauty. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>123).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Urvaśī and Purūravas.%} Purūravas was the son of Budha
<div n="lb"/>born of Ilā. He grew up and became a king of great
<div n="lb"/>renown. His fame reached even the realm of the gods.
<div n="lb"/>One day during that period Brahmā cursed Urvaśī. “Go
<div n="lb"/>and be born on the earth.” (It is stated in the Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata that it was Brahmā who cursed Urvaśī and in
<div n="lb"/>the Bhāgavata that it was the Mitrāvaruṇas who cursed
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī). Urvaśī had heard about the fame of Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>and had felt tender love for him. The celestial maid
<div n="lb"/>reached the earth. She went to the palace of Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>and saw him. Because of the perfection of their figures,
<div n="lb"/>both loved mutually. The king asked her to become
<div n="lb"/>his wife. She agreed. But she laid down three conditions.
<div n="NI"/>(i) I have with me two lambs which I bring up as my
<div n="lb"/>sons. You must take care of them. No harm should
<div n="lb"/>befall them.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) I take in only ghee. On no account should you
<div n="lb"/>compel me to eat any other food.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Don't come near me in nudity except at the time
<div n="lb"/>of coition.
<div n="NI"/>The king agreed to all these conditions. From that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards Urvaśī lived in the palace of the king as his
<div n="lb"/>wife. They lived happily for a long while without
<div n="lb"/>separating from each other.
<div n="NI"/>Urvaśī became conspicuous by her absence in the realm
<div n="lb"/>of the gods. She was the most expert actress in heaven.
[Page812-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Indra missed her. So a search was made and they found
<div n="lb"/>out that she was in the palace of Purūravas. Indra
<div n="lb"/>asked the Gandharvas to bring that celestial woman to
<div n="lb"/>heaven somehow. Viśvāvasu and some others of the
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas reached the palace of king Purūravas and
<div n="lb"/>waited for an opportunity. One midnight they stole
<div n="lb"/>the lambs and took them away through the sky. At
<div n="lb"/>that time the king was with Urvaśī in the harem.
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī heard the cry of the lambs and she was flurried.
<div n="lb"/>She reviled the king who was not capable of taking care
<div n="lb"/>of two lambs. Hearing her harsh words the king took
<div n="lb"/>his bow and arrow and following the cry of the lambs
<div n="lb"/>he was about to chase the thieves. Taking this oppor-
<div n="lb"/>tunity the Gandharvas caused a lightning to flash in the
<div n="lb"/>king's harem. In the light of the lightning Urvaśī saw
<div n="lb"/>the king standing nude. The Gandharvas having achi-
<div n="lb"/>eved their task had left the lambs and departed before
<div n="lb"/>the king had got out of the room. The king caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of the lambs and returned to the harem, within a
<div n="lb"/>short while. But Urvaśī had gone out of the palace
<div n="lb"/>and was on her way.
<div n="NI"/>The king was full of grief. He wandered all over the
<div n="lb"/>country in search of Urvaśī. At last he reached Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra and saw Urvaśī there. He bowed low before
<div n="lb"/>her and implored her to return to the palace. But
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī replied thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“Women are like wolves. Don't have alliance with them
<div n="lb"/>Oh King! Kings should not put faith in women and
<div n="lb"/>thieves.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying thus, Urvaśī vanished. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The reason why Purūravas had to remain separate from Urvaśī.%}
<div n="lb"/>Purūravas had once gone to heaven, in accordance with
<div n="lb"/>the invitation of Indra to help the Gods in the battle
<div n="lb"/>with the asuras. Indra had killed Māyādhara, a noble
<div n="lb"/>Asura, in that battle and had celebrated a festival. In
<div n="lb"/>that festival Rambhā was dancing before Tumburu, the
<div n="lb"/>sage-priest, and detecting some flaw in her dance Purū-
<div n="lb"/>ravas teased her. Rambhā retorted by asking the King
<div n="lb"/>what he knew about dance, and the king replied that he
<div n="lb"/>had learned from Urvasī more dance than Tumburu the
<div n="lb"/>teacher of Rambhā. Tumburu got angry at this, and
<div n="lb"/>cursed the king Purūravas to suffer from the pangs of
<div n="lb"/>separation from Urvaśī. Stricken with grief, Purūravas
<div n="lb"/>returned to his palace. It was after this that the Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharvas took away Urvaśī. Purūravas went to Badari-
<div n="lb"/>kāśrama and performed penance, meditating on God
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu for the nullification of the curse. Urvaśī, aggri-
<div n="lb"/>eved by separation from her husband, sat motionless as
<div n="lb"/>a picture, in the custody of the Gandharvas. Lord Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was pleased with the penance of Purūravas. The Gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharvas brought her back to the King. Thus it became
<div n="lb"/>possible for the king to meet Urvaśī at least once a year.
<div n="lb"/>(Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The sons born to Purūravas by Urvaśī.%} The king became
<div n="lb"/>very sad when Urvaśī was about to depart from him at
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra. Seeing his grief Urvaśī told him. “Oh
<div n="lb"/>King, if you want so much to live with me, you have to
<div n="lb"/>worship the Gandharvas. They will be pleased and
<div n="lb"/>will give me to you. Don't be sorry. Now I am preg-
<div n="lb"/>nant. Come to this place at the end of a year. We
<div n="lb"/>can spend that night together. Then we will get another
<div n="lb"/>son also that night.” Pleased at what Urvaśī had
<div n="lb"/>said, the king returned to his palace. On completion
<div n="lb"/>of a year Purūravas went to Kurukṣetra and spent a
[Page812-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>night with Urvaśī. Urvaśī gave Purūravas a very
<div n="lb"/>beautiful child and then she vanished. The king sat
<div n="lb"/>there and praised the Gandharvas, who gave the king
<div n="lb"/>an Agnisthālī (a fire pot). Because of his derangement,
<div n="lb"/>thinking it to be Urvaśī the king took the sthālī (pot)
<div n="lb"/>and wandered about in the forest. At last placing the
<div n="lb"/>pot in the forest, the king returned to his palace. On
<div n="lb"/>that day Tretāyuga (one of the four ages of the word)
<div n="lb"/>commenced, and the Vedas dawned in his mind as
<div n="lb"/>three in number. He returned to the place where
<div n="lb"/>he had left the Sthālī in the forest and took it. After
<div n="lb"/>that he made two ‘araṇis’ (wood from which fire is
<div n="lb"/>kindled by attrition) out of a banyan tree and placed his
<div n="lb"/>body between them and made fire. That fire is called
<div n="lb"/>‘Jātavedas.’ Thus Jātavedas became the son of
<div n="lb"/>Purūravas.
<div n="NI"/>Purūravas generated three fires from Jātavedas. The
<div n="lb"/>first of them is Praṇava. The second is called Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>and the third Agnivarṇa. (Śrīmad Bhāgavata, 9th
<div n="lb"/>Śkandha).
<div n="NI"/>To Purūravas six sons were born from the womb of
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī. They were Āyus, Śrutāyus, Satyāyus, Raya,
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya and Jaya. (A little difference is observed in these
<div n="lb"/>names in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 75,
<div n="lb"/>Stanzas 24 and 25).
<div n="NI"/>6) To know how a Gandharva named Durmada and
<div n="lb"/>a Vidyādharī named Unmadā played a trick on Purū-
<div n="lb"/>ravas and Urvaśī, see under Unmadā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%How Agastya and Vasiṣṭha were born to Mitrāvaruṇas be-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%cause of Urvaśī.%} In days of old there was a renowned
<div n="lb"/>king named Nimi in the family of Ikṣvāku. He decided
<div n="lb"/>to perform a sacrifice of a long duration. He began
<div n="lb"/>preparation and invited famous hermits such as Bhṛgu,
<div n="lb"/>Aṅgiras, Vāmadeva, Pulastya, Pulaha. Ṛcīka and others.
<div n="lb"/>Finally he invited Vasiṣṭha. At that time Indra had
<div n="lb"/>begun another sacrifice in heaven. So Vasiṣṭha went to
<div n="lb"/>heaven for that sacrifice, telling Nimi that he would
<div n="lb"/>conduct the sacrifice on his return. The emperor Nimi
<div n="lb"/>did not like it. Recognizing the hermit Gautama as
<div n="lb"/>the main priest, he began performing the sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>The sacrifice of Indra lasted for 500 years. When Vasiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭha returned after that, the sacrifice of Nimi was over.
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha cursed Nimi. “You will become devoid of
<div n="lb"/>body.” Nimi cursed back. “Let Vasiṣṭha also become
<div n="lb"/>thus.”
<div n="NI"/>The aggrieved Vasiṣṭha went to his father Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>complained about the curse. Brahmā told Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>“You penetrate the brightness of Mitrāvaruṇas and
<div n="lb"/>stay there. In due course you will get a birth which is
<div n="lb"/>not of a womb.” Hearing these words, Vasiṣṭha reached
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage of Mitrāvaruṇas. He left his body there
<div n="lb"/>and fused himself into their effulgence. During this
<div n="lb"/>period Urvaśī came to that hermitage. Seeing her,
<div n="lb"/>Mitrāvaruṇas had seminal flow. The semen fell in a
<div n="lb"/>pot. From the pot two bright and handsome sons were
<div n="lb"/>born. The first of them was Agastya and the second
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Indra cursing Urvaśī.%} Once Agastya went to the dur-
<div n="lb"/>bar of Indra. On the occasion Indra asked Urvaśī to
<div n="lb"/>dance. In the midst of the dance she saw Jayanta, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Indra, and became amorous and her steps went
<div n="lb"/>wrong. Nārada who was playing his famous lute called
<div n="lb"/>Mahatī could not play well. Agastya got angry and
<div n="lb"/>cursed Jayanta to become a bud. He cursed Nārada
<div n="lb"/>also. So his lute became the lute of the world. Urvaśī
[Page813-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was born on the earth under the name Mādhavī due to
<div n="lb"/>the curse.

<div n="lb"/>Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 10, Stanza 11, that Urvaśī had been in love
<div n="lb"/>with Kubera once.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Urvaśī was dismayed when Śukadeva attained Sup-
<div n="lb"/>reme Bliss. (See under Śuka).
