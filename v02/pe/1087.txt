BHĀSA¦. A very prominent dramatist in Sanskrit. As
<div n="lb"/>Bāṇa and Kālidāsa have noticed him in their works,
<div n="lb"/>it may safely be assumed that Bhāsa lived in an earlier
<div n="lb"/>period. Since Pratimā nāṭaka and Abhiṣeka nāṭaka,
<div n="lb"/>which are universally admitted to have been composed
<div n="lb"/>by Bhāsa, depend for their themes on the Vālmīki
[Page126-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, it is clear that Bhāsa lived after Vālmīki.
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa's period has not yet been fixed beyond doubt.
<div n="lb"/>It is almost settled that Bāṇa lived sometime between the
<div n="lb"/>sixth and seventh centuries A.D. Prof. Keith has been
<div n="lb"/>of the view that Vālmīki lived before the 4th century
<div n="lb"/>B.C. In the light of all such factors it could be presumed
<div n="lb"/>that Bhāsa lived in the period between the 4th century
<div n="lb"/>B.C. and 6th century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>Though Bhāsa has so many glories to his credit he does
<div n="lb"/>not fully match Kālidāsa, and this might have been the
<div n="lb"/>reason why Indians did almost forget Bhāsa with the
<div n="lb"/>advent of Kālidāsa on the literary arena.
<div n="NI"/>We are not in a position to name with unerring definite-
<div n="lb"/>ness the works of Bhāsa. The general belief is that he
<div n="lb"/>has written nearly twenty three dramas. In 1922, Pandit
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati Śāstrī unearthed from various sources thirteen
<div n="lb"/>dramas of Bhāsa. Three out of them, viz. Pratijñā-
<div n="lb"/>yaugandharāyaṇa, Śvapnavāsavadatta and Avimā-
<div n="lb"/>raka owe their themes to the Bṛhatkathā, while Prati-
<div n="lb"/>mā nāṭaka and Abhiṣeka nāṭaka have Rāmāyaṇa as
<div n="lb"/>their basic inspiration. Out of the eight remaining
<div n="lb"/>dramas six, viz. Madhyama vyāyoga, Pañcarātra, Dūta-
<div n="lb"/>vākya, Dūtaghaṭotkaca, Karṇabhāra and Ūrubhaṅga
<div n="lb"/>owe their themes to the Mahābhārata, while the last
<div n="lb"/>two dramas, Bālacarita and Cārudatta are dependent
<div n="lb"/>for their themes on anecdotes about Śrī Kṛṣṇa and on
<div n="lb"/>yakṣa stories.
<div n="NI"/>Though Dr. Gaṇapati Śāstrī has strongly contended that
<div n="lb"/>all the above thirteen dramas were written by Bhāsa
<div n="lb"/>himself, his view has not yet received universal accep-
<div n="lb"/>tance. Whatever that be, it is an admitted fact that
<div n="lb"/>Svapnavāsavadatta is by far the best among the thirteen
<div n="lb"/>dramas. It is a continuation of the story of Pratijñāyau-
<div n="lb"/>gandharāyaṇa. The wedding of king Udayana and
<div n="lb"/>Vāsavadattā is the subject matter of Svapnavāsava-
<div n="lb"/>datta.
<div n="NI"/>With his killing of the Rākṣasa ‘Avi’ the Sauvīra king
<div n="lb"/>comes to be known as Avimāra, and Avimāra's falling
<div n="lb"/>in love with Kuraṅgī, daughter of Kuntibhoja forms the
<div n="lb"/>theme of the drama, Avimāraka. In Pratimā nāṭaka
<div n="lb"/>is told the story narrated in Rāmāyaṇa from Ayodhyā-
<div n="lb"/>kāṇḍa to Paṭṭābhiṣeka. Abhiṣeka nāṭaka codifies the
<div n="lb"/>stories in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa and Sundara Kāṇḍa of
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛāmāyaṇa and describes the coronations of Sugrīva
<div n="lb"/>and of Śrī Rāma. Though the characters in Pañcarātra
<div n="lb"/>are borrowed from Mahābhārata the story is entirely
<div n="lb"/>Bhāsa's. Madhyama vyāyoga, Dūtavākya, Dūtaghaṭot-
<div n="lb"/>kaca, Karṇabhāra and Ūrubhaṅga are one-act plays.
<div n="lb"/>These five plays have as their basis some of the anecdotes
<div n="lb"/>in the Mahābhārata. In Cārudatta is treated the love
<div n="lb"/>story of Cārudatta and Vasantasenā.
<div n="NI"/>Indisputable evidence is still lacking to credit Bhāsa
<div n="lb"/>with the authorship of all the thirteen plays referred to
<div n="lb"/>above.
