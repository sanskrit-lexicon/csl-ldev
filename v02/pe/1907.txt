DHANAÑJAYA IV¦. A Sanskrit critic who lived during
<div n="lb"/>the period between 11th and 12th century A.D. He was
<div n="lb"/>a member of the court of King Muñja. His important
<div n="lb"/>work is ‘Daśarūpaka’. This work contains three
<div n="lb"/>hundred ślokas divided in four separate divisions. After
<div n="lb"/>the death of Muñja, Dhanika, brother of Dhanañjaya,
<div n="lb"/>wrote a commentary on this work. The treatise is
<div n="lb"/>named ‘Daśarūpāvaloka’. There are several quotations in
<div n="lb"/>this from the Sanskrit dramas ‘Veṇīsaṃhāra’ and ‘Ratnā-
<div n="lb"/>valī’. He has in this work discussed Drama and Poetry
<div n="lb"/>in general giving prominence to the emotional side of it.
<div n="lb"/>The critical work, Daśarūpāvaloka, contains quotations
<div n="lb"/>from a book ‘Kāvyanirṇaya’ by Dhanika himself. But
<div n="lb"/>the work ‘Kāvyanirṇaya’ has not yet been made avail-
<div n="lb"/>able. Even in composing poetry Dhanañjaya was well
<div n="lb"/>versed. He is the author of the well-known epic ‘Rāghava-
<div n="lb"/>pāṇḍavīya’. It is known as ‘Dvisandhāna Kāvya’ also.
<div n="lb"/>This is based on the lives of Pāṇḍavas and Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Dhanañjaya bears the name of Śrutakīrti also. It is
<div n="lb"/>stated by scholars that Rāghavapāṇḍavīya was written
<div n="lb"/>during the period 1123 to 1140 A.D. (History of classi-
<div n="lb"/>cal Sanskrit Literature).
