ŚIŚUMĀRA I¦. A Ṛṣi. This Ṛṣi used to live in water in
the form of a crocodile. There is a story about him in
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once all the Ṛṣis joined together in praising Indra.
Śiśumāra alone remained silent without taking part in
it. Seeing this, Devendra ordered Śiśumāra to praise
him. The sage answered proudly that he had no time
for it and that he would praise Indra for as much time
as was needed to throw the water upwards.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly he started praising Indra. The sage to
whom Indra's praise was at first disagreeable, subse-
quently felt that he could not do it too much. By his
austerity he acquired “Sāmavidyā”. He even compos-
ed a “Sāma” (a hymn) in praise of Indra. In later
times it became famous as “Śārkarasāma”.
