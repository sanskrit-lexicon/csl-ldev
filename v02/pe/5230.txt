PRABHĀKARA II¦. A great sage born of the race of

<div n="lb"/>and Strīratnakūṭā.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the Sun was in distress while he was being
<div n="lb"/>devoured by Rāhu, Sage Prabhākara said ‘Svasti’ to give
<div n="lb"/>salvation for the Sun and instantly the Sun came out
<div n="lb"/>from Rāhu's hold and shone brightly as before. It was
<div n="lb"/>as a result of this virtuous deed that the sage got the
<div n="lb"/>name Prabhākara. By his great knowledge and eminence
<div n="lb"/>he kept glowing the fame of Atrikula earned by gene-
<div n="lb"/>rations.

<div n="lb"/>the devas presented him with great wealth and ten sons
<div n="lb"/>(Harivaṃśa, 1. 81-8. 17).
