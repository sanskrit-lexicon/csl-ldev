PRABHĀKARA II¦. A great sage born of the race of
Atri. This sage married the ten daughters of Ghṛtācī
born of Raudrāśva (Bhadrāśva) of the family of Pūru.
The names of the daughters are Rudrā, Śūdrā, Maladā,
Bhadrā, Malahā, Khaladā, Naladā, Surasā, Gocapalā
and Strīratnakūṭā.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the Sun was in distress while he was being
devoured by Rāhu, Sage Prabhākara said ‘Svasti’ to give
salvation for the Sun and instantly the Sun came out
from Rāhu's hold and shone brightly as before. It was
as a result of this virtuous deed that the sage got the
name Prabhākara. By his great knowledge and eminence
he kept glowing the fame of Atrikula earned by gene-
rations.
<div n="NI"/>Sage Prabhākara conducted a Yāga and on the occasion
the devas presented him with great wealth and ten sons
(Harivaṃśa, 1. 81-8. 17).
