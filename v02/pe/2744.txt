INDĪVARĀKṢA¦. A Gandharva. He was the son of
Nalanābha, the chief of the Vidyādharas. There is a
story about this Gandharva in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa,
Chapter 60:—
<div n="NI"/>Indīvarākṣa went to the sage Brahmamitra to learn
Āyurveda. For some unknown reason, the sage did not
teach him. Indīvarākṣa decided to learn by overhearing
what the guru taught the other pupils from a hiding
place. In six months’ time he learnt Āyurveda. Over-
joyed at the thought that he was able to acquire as
much learning in this science as the other pupils, with-
in such a short time, and oblivious of his surroundings,
he laughed loudly. The guru who understood the secret,
uttered a curse that he would become a Rākṣasa within
seven days. The repentant Indīvarākṣa begged for his
pardon. Then the sage told him that he would be
restored to his own form and give up the Rākṣasa shape
when he was shot with arrows by his own children.
<div n="NI"/>Once when he approached his daughter Manoramā
to devour her, his son-in law, Svarocis who had learnt
the science of archery from that girl, defeated him. In
this way, Indīvarākṣa got his own former form. After
that he taught Svarocis, the sciences of archery which
he had learnt from his own daughter and also from
Brahmamitra.
