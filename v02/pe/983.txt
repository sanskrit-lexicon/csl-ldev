BHADRASĀRA¦. A king in the region of Kāśmīra. His
<div n="lb"/>only son, Sudharman, was very much devoted to Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and spent most of his time worshipping him. The
<div n="lb"/>father tried his best to withdraw his son from this ex-
<div n="lb"/>cessive devotion but failed.
<div n="NI"/>Then one day the great sage, Parāśara, came to the
<div n="lb"/>King as his guest and the King then requested him to
<div n="lb"/>make his son withdraw from his Śiva-worship. But
<div n="lb"/>Parāśara then told him about the previous life of
<div n="lb"/>Sudharmā and consoling him persuaded the King to do
<div n="lb"/>the ‘Rudrābhiṣeka’ (uninterrupted pouring of cold
<div n="lb"/>water over an idol of Śiva) by himself. The king then
<div n="lb"/>entrusted the state with his son and left for the forests
<div n="lb"/>accepting an ascetic life. (Skandha Purāṇa, 3.3.20-21).
