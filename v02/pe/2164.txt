aspects and moods assumes the forms of Kanyā,
Kāmākṣī and Mūkāmbā. In Kerala the Devī is called
Bhagavatī also, in Andhra Jokulāmbikā and in Tamil-
nadu Kaṇṇakī. Worship of the Devī is supposed to be
more than 4000 years old in India. In religious litera-
ture from Vedic times up to date Devī occupies an
important place. In modern India Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa
Paramahaṃsa, guru of Svāmī Vivekānanda, was a great
devotee of Durgā.
<div n="NI"/>In the Mahābhārata there are various references to the
Devī. When the Pāṇḍavas entered the capital of Virāṭa
for their life incognito they worshiped Durgā, who
appeared to them and granted them certain boons.
(Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 6). At the commencement of
the great war Arjuna, at the instance of Kṛṣṇa prayed
to Durgā, who appeared in the sky and granted him
boons, for victory in War. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 23).
