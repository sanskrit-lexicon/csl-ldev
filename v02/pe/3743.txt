KṢETRAPĀLA¦. Kṣetrapāla is consecrated on the South
East corner of the temple, for protecting the villages
and cities. This is a large image with three eyes. There
are figures which are Sāttvika, Rājasa and Tāmasa
(having the attributes goodness, ostentatiousness and
sloth). In some places figures having two or four or
eight hands are seen. It is presumed that this deity is
a portion of Śiva. It is stated in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter
51 that Kṣetrapālas should be figures having trident in
the hand.
