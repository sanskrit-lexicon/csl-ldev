UPAMANYU III¦. In the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa we come
across another Upamanyu as the son of a hermit named
Sutapas. Upamanyu reached the hermitage of Kaśyapa,
with the idea of marrying Sumati, the daughter of
Kaśyapa and the elder sister of Garuḍa. Nobody liked
the idea of giving Sumati in marriage to that old man.
The hermit got angry at this and cursed Kaśyapa that
if he gave his daughter in marriage to any Brāhmaṇa
his head would break into a hundred pieces. (Brahmā-
ṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 18).
