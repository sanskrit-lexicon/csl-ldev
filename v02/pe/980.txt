BHADRAMATI¦. A very poor brahmin. This brahmin
had six wives and two hundred and forty-four daughters.
(Nārada Purāṇam).
<div n="NI"/>Once, hearing the glory of Bhūdāna (giving away land
free to the deserved) he was much impressed and from
then onwards he became filled with a strong desire
to give land free to the poor. He had no land of his
own. But he went to the king of Kauśāmbī and begged
for some land which when received was immediately
given as gift to poor brahmins. After that he went and
bathed in the Pāpanāśana tīrtha situated in the mount
of Veṅkaṭācala. Bhadramati got salvation by this good
deed. (Skanda 2,1,10).
