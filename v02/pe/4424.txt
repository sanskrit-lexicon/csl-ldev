MARUTVĀMALA¦. In south India, at the southern tip
of the Sahya ranges, a mountain reputed for medicinal
herbs, may still be seen. This mountain is known by the
name “Marutvāmala”. A legend connected with the
origin of this mountain, is given in Uttara Rāmāyaṇa,
as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>It was the time of the battle between Śrī Rāma and
Rāvaṇa. Rāvaṇa's younger brother Vibhīṣaṇa joined
the side of Rāma and fought against Rāvaṇa. The
enraged Rāvaṇa shot his arrow at Vibhīṣaṇa. In his
endeavour to save Vibhīṣaṇa, Lakṣmaṇa fell down
unconscious. Rāma and his followers discussed how

Lakṣmaṇa could be revived. Jāmbavān observed that
there was a herb called “Droṇam” in one of the peaks
of the Himālayas and if it was brought at once,
Lakṣmaṇa could be restored to his senses. Hanūmān
flew to the Himālayas immediately. But although he
combed the forests there, he was not able to find the
herb Droṇam. So he tore away and lifted a whole peak
which was full of all kinds of medicinal herbs and
returned to Laṅkā. Jāmbavān took the needed herbs
from it and deposited the peak at the southern end of
India. This is the present Marutvāmala. (Mala means
mountain).
