APĀNTARATAMAS¦. 1) {%General.%} A Maharṣi (Great
<div n="lb"/>Sage). He was born out of the sound ‘bhu’ uttered by
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu. The sage is also known as Sārasvata and
<div n="lb"/>Apāntaratamas. Because he was absolutely free from
<div n="lb"/>inner darkness or ignorance he was called Apāntara-
<div n="lb"/>tamas. The sage, who was cognizant of the past, the
<div n="lb"/>present and the future divided and systematized the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas as ordered by Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>2) Vyāsa was Apāntaratamas reborn. Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>ordained that in the Dvāpara age he be born as the
<div n="lb"/>son of Parāśara and once again divide and systematize
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas, and so was he born as Vyāsa. (Śrī Śaṅkara's
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍakopaniṣad and Brahmasūtra Bhāṣya).
