AGNIPA¦. Son of a Brahmin named Vedanidhi. Once
<div n="lb"/>five gandharva maidens named Pramodinī, Suśīlā,
<div n="lb"/>Susvarā, Sutārā and Candrikā fell in love with him
<div n="lb"/>and requested him to marry them. Being a strict
<div n="lb"/>Brahmacārin Agnipa was offended by this request and
<div n="lb"/>so he cursed them and turned them into fiends. Veda-
<div n="lb"/>nidhi pitied them and sought the advice of sage Lomaśa
<div n="lb"/>as to how those unfortunate maidens could be redeemed
<div n="lb"/>from the curse. According to Lomaśa's advice the
<div n="lb"/>five maidens bathed in the holy lake of Prayāgatīrtha
<div n="lb"/>and regained their original forms. Then obeying the
<div n="lb"/>instructions of sage Lomaśa Agnipa married all these
<div n="lb"/>five gandharva maidens. (Chapters 128 and 129,
<div n="lb"/>Uttarakhaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
