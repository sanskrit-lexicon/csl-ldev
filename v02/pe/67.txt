AGNIPA¦. Son of a Brahmin named Vedanidhi. Once
five gandharva maidens named Pramodinī, Suśīlā,
Susvarā, Sutārā and Candrikā fell in love with him
and requested him to marry them. Being a strict
Brahmacārin Agnipa was offended by this request and
so he cursed them and turned them into fiends. Veda-
nidhi pitied them and sought the advice of sage Lomaśa
as to how those unfortunate maidens could be redeemed
from the curse. According to Lomaśa's advice the
five maidens bathed in the holy lake of Prayāgatīrtha
and regained their original forms. Then obeying the
instructions of sage Lomaśa Agnipa married all these
five gandharva maidens. (Chapters 128 and 129,
Uttarakhaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
