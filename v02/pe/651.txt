AVATĀRA¦. (Incarnation). The incarnations of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu:—
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} God takes three kinds of incar-
<div n="lb"/>nations such as avatāra, āveśa and aṃśa. That which
<div n="lb"/>has full power is avatāra; that which has power only
<div n="lb"/>for the time being is āveśa and partial incarnation in
<div n="lb"/>aṃśāvatāra.
<F>*) See Aṃśāvatāra.</F> The incarnations of Viṣṇu are count-
<div n="lb"/>less. Hermits, Manus, Devas (gods) and sons of Manus
<div n="lb"/>are incarnations in part (aṃśāvatāras) of Viṣṇu. Com-
<div n="lb"/>plete avatāras are ten in numbers of which Balabhadra
<div n="lb"/>Rāma is not considered as an avatāra by some. In-
<div n="lb"/>stead of him they place Buddha.
<div n="NI"/>{%b) Reason for the incarnations.%} Mahāviṣṇu has taken so
<div n="lb"/>many incarnations in the world. In the Śrī Mahādevī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata a story occurs to the effect that Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>was forced to take so large a number of incarnations
<div n="lb"/>due to the curse of the great hermit Bhṛgu. The story
<div n="lb"/>is as follows: Kaśyapa had a son named Kaśipu. He
<div n="lb"/>was daring and brave and ruled the country as an
<div n="lb"/>enemy of the Gods. There arose a severe battle between
<div n="lb"/>the gods and the Asuras. Kaśipu was killed in that
<div n="lb"/>battle. After Kaśipu his son Prahlāda became King.
<div n="lb"/>He too was an enemy of the Gods. So there was a
<div n="lb"/>battle between Indra and Prahlāda. The battle conti-
<div n="lb"/>nued for a hundred years. At last Prahlāda was defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed. He felt very sorry at the defeat. So he anointed
<div n="lb"/>Bali, son of Virocana, as King and leaving the Kingdom
<div n="lb"/>he went to the Gandhamādana and began to do
<div n="lb"/>penance. The fight continued between Bali and Indra.
<div n="NI"/>In this fight Mahāviṣṇu helped Indra. The Asuras were
<div n="lb"/>completely destroyed. The defeated Asuras went to
<div n="lb"/>their teacher Śukra who promised to protect them by
<div n="lb"/>spells and incantations and herbs. The Gods knew
<div n="lb"/>that Śukra had undertaken to protect the asuras.
<div n="NI"/>Leaving the asuras behind, Śukra went to Kailāsa to
<div n="lb"/>get more power of spells and incantations from Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Before going to Kailāsa Śukra had asked the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>to wait for him with faith. After this the Asuras sent
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda to the Gods for a truce. Prahlāda, though an
<div n="lb"/>Asura was in good favour with the Gods. He reached
<div n="lb"/>the court of Indra and said, “Gods, we have no desire
<div n="lb"/>at all for war. We have decided to spend the remain-
<div n="lb"/>ing period in penance wearing barks of trees and tufts
<div n="lb"/>of hair. How wicked a deed is battle and how delight-
<div n="lb"/>ful it is to become a devotee of God! So hereafter you
<div n="lb"/>will not be troubled by us. Likewise I hope you will
<div n="lb"/>not do us innocent people any harm.”
<div n="NI"/>The gods believed Prahlāda. The Asuras, in the guise
<div n="lb"/>of hermits waited for Śukra in the hermitage of Kaś-
<div n="lb"/>yapa. Śukra reached Kailāsa and bowed before Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>requested that he might be given the power of defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ing the Gods by some means quite unknown to Bṛhas-
<div n="lb"/>pati the teacher of the devas (Gods). Śiva was in
[Page079-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>trouble. He could refuse neither Śukra nor the Gods.
<div n="lb"/>At last he told hermit Śukra that to come by such a
<div n="lb"/>spell he had to stand head downwards, inhaling smoke
<div n="lb"/>for a thousand years. Śiva said so thinking that when
<div n="lb"/>the dreadful nature of the feat was considered, Śukra
<div n="lb"/>might desist from the attempt. But Śukra began that
<div n="lb"/>penance instantly.
<div n="NI"/>The Gods understood everything. The deceit of the
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, the crookedness of Śukra all were now clear to
<div n="lb"/>them. They trembled with fear and began to consult
<div n="lb"/>how to get over the difficult situation. Finally they
<div n="lb"/>decided to go to war with the Asuras. The gods did
<div n="lb"/>accordingly. The Asuras were in trouble. They were
<div n="lb"/>not strong enough to face the Gods. So they all went
<div n="lb"/>to Kāvyamātā, the mother of Śukra. The devas (gods)
<div n="lb"/>with Mahāviṣṇu at their head chased the Asuras. Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>mātā, by the merits of her devotional meditation
<div n="lb"/>petrified Mahāviṣṇu and Indra. Mahāviṣṇu thought of
<div n="lb"/>his Sudarśana (wheel-weapon of Viṣṇu) which instant-
<div n="lb"/>ly made its appearance and cut off the head of Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>mātā. The great hermit Bhṛgu got angry because Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu committed woman-slaughter, and cursed him thus:
<div n="lb"/>“You are a crooked being, a viper, a deceit. The
<div n="lb"/>hermits who adore you as the seat of all that is good
<div n="lb"/>are mere fools; you are wicked, of a black character,
<div n="lb"/>and I curse you to take countless incarnations in the
<div n="lb"/>world, and painful confinement by and by because of
<div n="lb"/>your sins.” (Śrī Mahādevī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Thus having cursed Viṣṇu, the hermit Bhṛgu took some
<div n="lb"/>water from his water-pot and sprinkled it on the face of
<div n="lb"/>Kāvyamātā, who woke up as if from sleep. (For the
<div n="lb"/>remaining portion of the story see Śukra).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Daśāvatāras. (The ten Incarnations).%} Owing to the curse
<div n="lb"/>of Bhṛgu, mentioned above, Mahāviṣṇu had to under-
<div n="lb"/>take so many incarnations, complete as well as partial.
<div n="lb"/>Complete incarnations are ten in number. They are
<div n="lb"/>called Daśāvatāras (The Ten Incarnations).

<div n="NI"/>Matsya (Fish), Kūrma (Turtle), Varāha (Pig), Nara-
<div n="lb"/>siṃha (Lion-man), Vāmana (Dwarf), Rāma (Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma), Rāma (Śrī Rāma), Rāma (Balabhadrarāma),
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa (Śrī Kṛṣṇa), Kalki (Yet to come). These are
<div n="lb"/>the ten incarnations of Janārdana.
<div n="NI"/>The daśāvatāras. are described one by one below.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Matsyāvatāra. (Fish Incarnation).%} To Kaśyapa, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Marīci, and the grandson of Brahmā a son
<div n="lb"/>was born, by his wife Aditi. He was called Vivasvān
<div n="lb"/>and the Manu who was the son of Vivasvān is known
<div n="lb"/>as Vaivasvata Manu or Satyavrata Manu. It was dur-
<div n="lb"/>ing the time of this Manu that Viṣṇu incarnated as a
<div n="lb"/>Matsya (fish).
<div n="NI"/>Once, while Brahmā was reciting the Vedas (the Scrip-
<div n="lb"/>tures) Hayagrīva, an asura, stole the Vedas from the
<div n="lb"/>side of Brahmā and with them he went under water to
<div n="lb"/>the bottom of the ocean and hid himself there. So
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu decided to take the form of a fish to recover
<div n="lb"/>the stolen Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>Vaivasvata Manu, the first and foremost of the godfear-
<div n="lb"/>ing, was once doing penance in a place known as Badarī.
<div n="lb"/>He got down into the river Kṛtamālā to take a bath.
<div n="lb"/>Then a small fish said to the Manu: “Oh King, I am
<div n="lb"/>afraid of large fishes. So please don't forsake me”. Hear-
[Page079-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ing this the Kind Manu took the fish in his hand and
<div n="lb"/>put it in an earthenware pot and brought it up. In a
<div n="lb"/>few days the fish began to grow. When the pot became
<div n="lb"/>insufficient the King put it in a larger pot. When that
<div n="lb"/>also became too small, the King put the fish in a pond.
<div n="lb"/>When the pond could not hold the fish any longer the
<div n="lb"/>King put it in the Ganges at its request. After a few days
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges also became too small for the fish. Finally
<div n="lb"/>the fish told the King: “Oh, King, within seven days
<div n="lb"/>there will be a great flood in the world. You should
<div n="lb"/>make a boat and take the seven hermit-sages with you
<div n="lb"/>in the boat and escape. I will help you.”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this he got an immensely large boat ready and
<div n="lb"/>obeyed the instructions of the fish. Within seven days
<div n="lb"/>rain started in torrents. Everything in the world, the
<div n="lb"/>moving and the not moving, were under the flood. A
<div n="lb"/>horn began to sprout from the head of the fish. Manu
<div n="lb"/>tied his boat on that horn. The fish reached the summit
<div n="lb"/>of the Himālayas with the boat, which was tied to the
<div n="lb"/>highest peak. Since the peak came to be called ‘Nau-
<div n="lb"/>bandhana Śṛṅga’ (The peak to which boat is tied).
<div n="lb"/>The rain ceased to pour. It was seen that everything
<div n="lb"/>in the world had been destroyed except the Manu and
<div n="lb"/>the seven hermit-sages and some of the germs, saved
<div n="lb"/>in the boat. (This story occurs in the great Hindi work
<div n="lb"/>‘Kāmāyanī’ of Jayaśaṅkar Prasād). (M.B., Araṇya
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 187; Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 2; Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>8th Skandha, Chapter 24).
<div n="NI"/>This story of the incarnation of Viṣṇu as fish is seen in
<div n="lb"/>the Bible figuratively. “In the order of the generations
<div n="lb"/>of Adam, the first creation of God, Śeth, Enos; Kainān,
<div n="lb"/>Mahalīl, Jāred, Enoch, Methūselah, Lamech and Noah
<div n="lb"/>were born. When Noah was five hundred years old he
<div n="lb"/>begot Shem, Ham and Japheth.
<div n="NI"/>There was a great flood during the time of Noah. God
<div n="lb"/>said to him: “The end of all flesh is come before one;
<div n="lb"/>for the earth is filled with violence through them, and
<div n="lb"/>behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee
<div n="lb"/>an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
<div n="lb"/>ark and shalt paint it within and without with pitch.
<div n="lb"/>And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of. The
<div n="lb"/>length of the ark should be three hundred cubits, the
<div n="lb"/>breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty
<div n="lb"/>cubits. A window shalt thou make to the ark and in a
<div n="lb"/>cubit shall thou finish it above and the door of the ark
<div n="lb"/>shalt thou set in the side thereof, with lower, second and
<div n="lb"/>third stories shalt thou make it. And behold, I, even I,
<div n="lb"/>do bring a flood of water up on the earth. to destroy all
<div n="lb"/>flesh wherein is the breadth of life from under heaven
<div n="lb"/>and everything that is in the earth shall die. But with
<div n="lb"/>thee will I establish my covenant, and thou shalt come
<div n="lb"/>into the ark, thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy
<div n="lb"/>sons' wives with thee, and of every living thing of all
<div n="lb"/>flesh, two of every sort, shalt thou bring into the ark to
<div n="lb"/>keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and fe-
<div n="lb"/>male. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after
<div n="lb"/>their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth
<div n="lb"/>after their kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee
<div n="lb"/>to keep them alive. And take thou unto thee of all food
<div n="lb"/>that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee, and it
<div n="lb"/>shall be for food for thee and for them.” Thus did Noah
<div n="lb"/>according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
<div n="NI"/>And the Lord said unto Noah, “Come thou and all thy
<div n="lb"/>house into the ark, for thee Have I seen righteous be-
<div n="lb"/>fore me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou
[Page080-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female
<div n="lb"/>and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and
<div n="lb"/>his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens the male
<div n="lb"/>and the female to keep seed alive up on the face of all
<div n="lb"/>the earth. For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain
<div n="lb"/>up on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every
<div n="lb"/>living substance that I have made will I destroy from
<div n="lb"/>off the earth.” And Noah did according unto all that
<div n="lb"/>the Lord commanded him.
<div n="NI"/>And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of
<div n="lb"/>waters was up on the earth. And Noah went in, and
<div n="lb"/>his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him into
<div n="lb"/>the ark because of the waters of the flood. Of clean
<div n="lb"/>beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and
<div n="lb"/>of everything that creepeth upon the earth. There went
<div n="lb"/>in two and two unto Noah into the ark the male and
<div n="lb"/>the female as God had commanded Noah. And it came
<div n="lb"/>to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were
<div n="lb"/>upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's
<div n="lb"/>life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the
<div n="lb"/>month the same day were all the fountains of the
<div n="lb"/>great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were
<div n="lb"/>opened and the rain was up on the earth for forty
<div n="lb"/>days and forty nights. In the self-same day entered
<div n="lb"/>Noah and Shem, and Ham and Japheth the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Noah and Noah's wife and the wives of the sons
<div n="lb"/>with them into the ark. They and every beast after
<div n="lb"/>his kind and all the cattle after their kind and
<div n="lb"/>every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
<div n="lb"/>and every fowl after his earth after his kind, every
<div n="lb"/>bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah
<div n="lb"/>into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the
<div n="lb"/>breadth of life. And they that went in, went in male
<div n="lb"/>and female of all flesh as God had commanded him
<div n="lb"/>and the Lord shut him in. And the flood was forty days
<div n="lb"/>upon the earth, and the waters increased and bore up
<div n="lb"/>the ark and it was lifted up above the earth. And the
<div n="lb"/>waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the
<div n="lb"/>earth and the ark went up on the face of the waters.
<div n="lb"/>And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth
<div n="lb"/>and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven
<div n="lb"/>were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters
<div n="lb"/>prevail and the mountains were covered. And all the
<div n="lb"/>flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and
<div n="lb"/>of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that
<div n="lb"/>creepeth up on the earth, and every man. All in whose
<div n="lb"/>nostrils was the breadth of life, of all that was in the
<div n="lb"/>dry land, died. And every living substance was des-
<div n="lb"/>troyed which was up on the face of the ground both
<div n="lb"/>man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl
<div n="lb"/>of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth.
<div n="lb"/>And Noah only remained alive, and they that were
<div n="lb"/>with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon
<div n="lb"/>the earth for hundred and fifty days.
<div n="NI"/>And God remembered Noah and every living thing
<div n="lb"/>and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and
<div n="lb"/>God made a wind to pass over the earth and the
<div n="lb"/>waters became calm. The fountains also of the deep
<div n="lb"/>and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain
<div n="lb"/>from heaven was restrained. And the waters returned
<div n="lb"/>from off the earth continually and after the end of the
<div n="lb"/>hundred and fifty days, the waters were abated. And the
<div n="lb"/>ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day
<div n="lb"/>of the month upon the mountains of Arārat. And the
<div n="lb"/>waters decreased continually until the tenth month.
[Page080-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>In the tenth month on the first day of the month
<div n="lb"/>were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to
<div n="lb"/>pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the
<div n="lb"/>window of the ark which he had made. And he sent
<div n="lb"/>forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters
<div n="lb"/>were dried up from off the earth. Also he sent forth
<div n="lb"/>a dove from him to see if the waters were abated
<div n="lb"/>from off the face of the ground. But the dove found
<div n="lb"/>no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned
<div n="lb"/>unto him into the ark for the waters were on
<div n="lb"/>the face of the whole earth. Then Noah put forth
<div n="lb"/>his hand and took her and pulled her to the ark. And
<div n="lb"/>he stayed yet other seven days. And again he sent
<div n="lb"/>forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came
<div n="lb"/>in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth
<div n="lb"/>was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that
<div n="lb"/>the waters were abated from off the earth. And he
<div n="lb"/>stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove,
<div n="lb"/>which returned not again unto him anymore. And it
<div n="lb"/>came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the
<div n="lb"/>first month, the first day of the month the waters were
<div n="lb"/>dried up from off the earth and Noah removed the
<div n="lb"/>covering of the ark and looked and beheld the face of
<div n="lb"/>the ground was dry. And in the second month on the
<div n="lb"/>seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth
<div n="lb"/>dried. And God spake unto Noah saying: “Go forth of
<div n="lb"/>the ark, thou and thy wife, and thy sons and thy sons'
<div n="lb"/>wives with thee. Bring forth with thee every living thing
<div n="lb"/>that is with thee, of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and
<div n="lb"/>of every creeping thing that creepeth up on the earth,
<div n="lb"/>that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be
<div n="lb"/>fruitful and multiply up on the earth. And Noah went
<div n="lb"/>forth and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives
<div n="lb"/>with him. Every beast, every creeping thing and every
<div n="lb"/>fowl and whatsoever creep up on the earth after their
<div n="lb"/>kinds went forth out of the ark. And Noah built an
<div n="lb"/>altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and
<div n="lb"/>of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the
<div n="lb"/>altar. And the Lord smelt a sweet savour and the Lord
<div n="lb"/>said in his heart: “I will not again curse the ground
<div n="lb"/>anymore for man's sake. For the imagination of man's
<div n="lb"/>heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I again smite
<div n="lb"/>anymore every thing as I have done. While the earth
<div n="lb"/>remaineth seed time and harvest and cold and heat
<div n="lb"/>and summer and winter and day and night shall not
<div n="lb"/>cease. (Holy Bible, Genesis, Chapters 6, 7 and 8).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kūrmāvatāra. (Incarnation as a tortoise).%} Long ago
<div n="lb"/>when Durvāsas visited the realm of Gods he presented
<div n="lb"/>Devendra with a garland made of flowers of exquisite
<div n="lb"/>fragrance. Indra tied it on to the tusk of Airāvata (the
<div n="lb"/>elephant of Indra). When the beetles which gathered
<div n="lb"/>on the garland for honey became a nuisance, Airā-
<div n="lb"/>vata destroyed that garland. Durvāsas who got angry
<div n="lb"/>at this cursed the gods as a whole that they would get
<div n="lb"/>wrinkles and grey hair. The gods were advised by
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu that if they got Ambrosia (Amṛta—celestial
<div n="lb"/>honey) from the sea of Milk by churning it they could
<div n="lb"/>escape from this. Accordingly the Gods called the
<div n="lb"/>asuras for help, and they approached the sea of Milk.
<div n="lb"/>They made use of the Mountain of Mandara as churn-
<div n="lb"/>drill and the huge snake Vāsuki as churning rope, and
<div n="lb"/>the churning commenced. The gods took hold of the
<div n="lb"/>tail of the snake and as the churning was proceeding
<div n="lb"/>the churn-drill, the mountain of Mandara, having no
<div n="lb"/>fixation at the bottom sank down. Then Mahāviṣṇu
[Page081-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>took the form of a turtle, and got under the Mandara
<div n="lb"/>mountain and lifted it up on his back. By the force of
<div n="lb"/>lifting it went higher and higher up. Then Mahāviṣṇu took
<div n="lb"/>the form of an eagle and sat on the top of the mountain
<div n="lb"/>and it came down a little and placed itself in the right
<div n="lb"/>position. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 8, Chapter 7; Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 3; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>Sarga 45).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Varāhāvatāra. (Incarnation as a Pig).%} Jaya and Vijaya
<div n="lb"/>were the two watchers who stood at the gate of Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu. Once the great hermit-sages Sanaka and others
<div n="lb"/>reached Vaikuṇṭha to visit Mahāviṣṇu. Then Jaya and
<div n="lb"/>Vijaya treated the hermits without respect. The hermits
<div n="lb"/>cursed them that they would become Dānavas (Asuras
<div n="lb"/>or giants). They also said that when they were slain
<div n="lb"/>thrice by Mahāviṣṇu they would reach heaven. At
<div n="lb"/>that period when hermit Kaśyapa was carrying on
<div n="lb"/>his evening prayer and devotional rites, his wife Diti
<div n="lb"/>approached him with lustful desire. Kaśyapa told her
<div n="lb"/>that as he was engaged in prayer and meditation it
<div n="lb"/>was not proper on her part to select that particular
<div n="lb"/>moment for her lustful desire. But she persisted and
<div n="lb"/>the sage yielded and out of that union two sons were
<div n="lb"/>born. They are the two asuras Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu. Of these Hiraṇyākṣa was the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Jaya and Hiraṇyakaśipu that of Vijaya.
<F>*) During their next birth they made their appearance as Rāvnca and Kumbhakarṇa and during the third birth they were Śiśupāla and
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍavaktra.</F> With the
<div n="lb"/>birth of these two the whole world began to tremble.
<div n="lb"/>These two asura brothers began to terrorize the world.
<div n="lb"/>They wandered about causing destruction and devasta-
<div n="lb"/>tion wherever they went. Once Hiraṇyākṣa got down
<div n="lb"/>into the ocean and began to beat the waves in the
<div n="lb"/>ocean with his cudgel. The ocean began to sway and
<div n="lb"/>surge. Varuṇa (the Lord of water) was terrified and
<div n="lb"/>he ran to Mahāviṣṇu and sought protection. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu took the form of a Pig and came to the ocean.
<div n="lb"/>When Hiraṇyākṣa saw Mahāviṣṇu he took the earth in
<div n="lb"/>his hand and ran to Pātāla (the nether world). Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu followed him and killed him and recovered the
<div n="lb"/>earth. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 3, Chapter 18; Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 2, Chapter 7 and Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 4).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Narasiṃhāvatāra. (Incarnation as lion-man).%} With the
<div n="lb"/>death of Hiraṇyākṣa, his brother Hiraṇyakaśipu became
<div n="lb"/>furious more than ever. He wanted to avenge the death
<div n="lb"/>of his brother. His fury was turned towards Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>So he got on the top of the Mountain of Mandara and
<div n="lb"/>did penance before Brahmā and Brahmā appeared and
<div n="lb"/>granted him boons, one of which was that nobody but
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu should be able to kill him. He returned with
<div n="lb"/>gladness and began to roam about torturing devotees
<div n="lb"/>of Viṣṇu everywhere.
<div n="NI"/>A son named Prahlāda was born to him. He was a god-
<div n="lb"/>fearing child and from birth an ardent believer in Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu tried his utmost to change his son to a
<div n="lb"/>hater of Viṣṇu. He got a special teacher for the
<div n="lb"/>purpose and Prahlāda was taken to the house of the
<div n="lb"/>teacher to live with him until he changed his mind. The
<div n="lb"/>result was that the teacher and all others who advised
<div n="lb"/>him ultimately became believers in Viṣṇu. Anger over-
<div n="lb"/>powered Hiraṇyakaśipu. Prahlāda was thrown before
<div n="lb"/>mad elephants. But the tusks of the elephant missed the
<div n="lb"/>aim and were driven into the earth and broken. Veno-
<div n="lb"/>mous snakes were employed and those which bit him had
<div n="lb"/>their fangs broken. Finally the child was put in blazing
[Page081-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>fire. But the child felt the fire to be cool and soothing.
<div n="lb"/>From that fire a ghost arose and tried to kill Prahlāda.
<div n="lb"/>Instantly the Sudarśana, the wheel-weapon of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>came down and cut off the head of the ghost. Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu jumped with anger and called out. “Where
<div n="lb"/>is your Viṣṇu?” His son replied that his Viṣṇu dwelt
<div n="lb"/>in every movable and immovable thing. Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>kicked at a stone pillar close by and asked him, “Is
<div n="lb"/>your Viṣṇu in this pillar?” Prahlāda replied, “My Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>is in Pillar and in fibre”. Before he had finished, the
<div n="lb"/>Pillar broke open and a monster as horrible as the
<div n="lb"/>Destroyer Śiva, in the shape of a lion-man made its
<div n="lb"/>appearance.

<div n="NI"/>“Before him who was waiting with curiosity to see what
<div n="lb"/>would happen, with eyes blazing as molten gold, mouth
<div n="lb"/>wide open in the middle of long bushy mane, tusks
<div n="lb"/>long and curved and protruding fearfully, tongue sway-
<div n="lb"/>ing like a sword, eyebrows fierce looking, ears standing
<div n="lb"/>erect and still, two nostrils as wide and deep as moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain canyons, jaws prominent and thick and broad and
<div n="lb"/>set with fierceness, colossal body reaching the sky, neck
<div n="lb"/>very thick and fat and short, breast excessively broad
<div n="lb"/>and strong, waist very small and narrow, body thickly
<div n="lb"/>covered with bushy hair exuberantly grown and as
<div n="lb"/>yellow as the light of the moon, a number of claws very
<div n="lb"/>sharp and pointed, the horrid monster Narasiṃha
<div n="lb"/>(Lion with human head) suddenly appeared. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, Skandha 7, Chapter 8, Stanzas 20-22).
<div n="NI"/>This was the figure of Narasiṃha. Mr. S. Paramesvara
<div n="lb"/>Iyer, Ulloor, has described this figure in his “Bhakti-
<div n="lb"/>dīpikā” as follows:
<div n="NI"/>“Glaring eyes burning as blazing cinder, tongue as a
<div n="lb"/>dagger just used in piercing to death, neck with folds,
<div n="lb"/>eyebrows looking mad, tusks like young moon, fierce
<div n="lb"/>face with bushy mane grown to it, hair long and sharp
<div n="lb"/>like pointed wire, claws looking like having drunk blood,
<div n="lb"/>body shining as if countless suns had risen together, all
<div n="lb"/>combined as if the fire of anger burning inside had
<div n="lb"/>incarnated, in the shape of a lion up to neck and
<div n="lb"/>human shape beyond the neck.” (Bhaktidīpikā)
<div n="NI"/>The horrid monster caught hold of Hiraṇyakaśipu the
<div n="lb"/>King of the Asuras, pushed him to the ground and
<div n="lb"/>opened his heart with its fierce claws. Blood sprouted
<div n="lb"/>like a spring. With great ferocity he pulled out the in-
<div n="lb"/>testines of Hiraṇyakaśipu and wore them round his
<div n="lb"/>neck as a garland and roared loudly. Prahlāda, with
<div n="lb"/>songs of praise and chanting of hymns of adoration
<div n="lb"/>pacified the stormy Narasiṃha and bowed low down
<div n="lb"/>before him. The Narasiṃha was pleased with the devo-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Prahlāda. He blessed the child and then dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 7, Chapter 8).
[Page082-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Vāmanāvatāra. (Incarnation as a Dwarf).%} It was to ex-
<div n="lb"/>pel the Emperor Mahābali, that Mahāviṣṇu incarnat-
<div n="lb"/>ed as a dwarf. To Kaśyapa, the son of Marīci and
<div n="lb"/>the grandson of Brahmā, was born of Diti, Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu. And from Prahlāda the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu
<div n="lb"/>was born Virocana and Bali was the son of Virocana.
<div n="lb"/>Bali got the name Mahābali because of his prowess.
<div n="lb"/>He was the emperor of the Asuras. A fierce battle
<div n="lb"/>began over the Ambrosia got from churning the sea
<div n="lb"/>of Milk, between the Asuras and the gods. In the battle
<div n="lb"/>Indra cut Mahābali down with his Vajrāyudha. The
<div n="lb"/>Asuras took the body of Mahābali to Pātāla (the
<div n="lb"/>nether world) where their teacher Śukra brought him to
<div n="lb"/>life again. Then Mahābali worshipped the Bhārgavas
<div n="lb"/>and became more powerful than before and went to
<div n="lb"/>heaven again and renewed the battle. This time he
<div n="lb"/>defeated the Gods altogether and subjugated the realm
<div n="lb"/>of the Gods who were scattered to all sides. The devas
<div n="lb"/>or gods are the sons of Kaśyapa born by his wife, Aditi.
<div n="lb"/>She felt very sorry at the defeat of the gods. Seeing that
<div n="lb"/>she was silent and sad Kaśyapa asked her the reason.
<div n="lb"/>She replied that she was thinking of ways to enable the
<div n="lb"/>gods to recover their lost power and position. Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>advised her to please Mahāviṣṇu by observing Dvā-
<div n="lb"/>daśī vrata (fast of the twelfth lunar night). Aditi did
<div n="lb"/>so and Viṣṇu appeared before her and asked her what
<div n="lb"/>she desired. Her request was that Viṣṇu should take
<div n="lb"/>birth in her womb and recover Indra to his lost power
<div n="lb"/>and position. Thus Viṣṇu took birth as the younger
<div n="lb"/>brother of Indra in the shape of Vāmana (dwarf.)
<div n="NI"/>At this time Emperor Mahābali was celebrating a sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fice on the bank of the River Narmadā after having
<div n="lb"/>subjugated the whole of the world. A large number of
<div n="lb"/>hermits gathered there. Vāmana also was among them.
<div n="lb"/>He requested Mahābali to grant him three feet of
<div n="lb"/>ground as alms. The teacher Śukra warned Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>against granting the request. But the emperor granted
<div n="lb"/>the request and asked Vāmana to measure the ground.
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana immediately enlarged his body and measured
<div n="lb"/>the heaven, the earth and the Pātāla (the upper realm,
<div n="lb"/>the earth and the lower realm) in two steps and asked
<div n="lb"/>for place for the third step. The honest Mahābali
<div n="lb"/>showed his head and requested to complete the three
<div n="lb"/>steps. Vāmana put his step on the head of Mahābali and
<div n="lb"/>pushed him down to Pātāla. Thus the gods regained
<div n="lb"/>their lost places. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 8, Chapter 19).
<div n="lb"/>A description that by the toe of Vāmanas' raised foot
<div n="lb"/>(raised for measuring the third step) the testicle of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā was cut open where from the Ganges originated,
<div n="lb"/>is seen in the Bhāgavata, Skandha 5.
<div n="NI"/>When Viśvāmitra took Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to the
<div n="lb"/>forest they entered a holy hermitage and Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>told the boys that it was the hermitage where Aditi,
<div n="lb"/>long ago had observed dvādaśī fast. It was in that same
<div n="lb"/>place that Vāmana incarnated and placed his step on
<div n="lb"/>the head of Mahābali.
<div n="NI"/>“The bright Mādhava took birth in Aditi as Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>and went to Mahābali, requested for three feet of ground
<div n="lb"/>and brought under control the three worlds for the good
<div n="lb"/>of all. By binding Bali by might, he gave to Indra the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds and this hermitage is the place where He
<div n="lb"/>once placed his steps. I am a devotee of that Vāmana.”
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 29).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Paraśurāmāvatāra. (Incarnation as Paraśurāma).%} Once
<div n="lb"/>Kārttavīryārjuna pleased the hermit-sage Dattātreya
[Page082-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>the son of Atri, by doing penance and got the boon of
<div n="lb"/>one thousand hands. One day he went to the forest for
<div n="lb"/>hunting and entered the bank of Narmadā. The hermit
<div n="lb"/>Jamadagni had been living there with his wife Reṇukā
<div n="lb"/>and sons Paraśurāma and others. The King being tired
<div n="lb"/>of hunting got into the hermitage. Paraśurāma was not
<div n="lb"/>there. The hermit called his divine cow Kāmadhenu,
<div n="lb"/>which provided the King and his followers with a very
<div n="lb"/>good supper.
<div n="NI"/>When the King departed he asked for the wonderful
<div n="lb"/>cow. The hermit did not consent. The King caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of the cow by force and went to his city. Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma went to Māhiṣmatīnagar the capital of Kārtta-
<div n="lb"/>vīryārjuna, killed the King and took Kāmadhenu back.
<div n="lb"/>From that day onwards the sons of Kārttavīrya were
<div n="lb"/>waiting for an opportunity to take revenge.
<div n="NI"/>Once Reṇukā went to the river to bring water. A gan-
<div n="lb"/>dharva (semi god) named Citraratha was bathing in
<div n="lb"/>the river. She happened to look at him for a little while.
<div n="lb"/>When she returned the hermit was very angry and asked
<div n="lb"/>each of his sons to cut off the head of their mother. They
<div n="lb"/>all refused. But Paraśurāma immediately obeyed his
<div n="lb"/>father and cut off her head. His father was pleased and
<div n="lb"/>said that he might ask any boon. He requested his father
<div n="lb"/>to bring his mother back to life. Accordingly Reṇukā
<div n="lb"/>was brought back to life.
<div n="NI"/>Once the sons of Kārttavīrya got into the hermitage,
<div n="lb"/>at a time when Paraśurāma was away and cut off the
<div n="lb"/>head of the hermit Jamadagni and took it off. When he
<div n="lb"/>returned his mother told him how his father was killed.
<div n="lb"/>She cried and beat her breast twentyone times. Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma became an incarnation of revenge, and travelled
<div n="lb"/>over the world twentyone times and killed every Kṣat-
<div n="lb"/>riya King. The blood of all those Kings flowed into one
<div n="lb"/>channel and gathered in a holy Bath called Syamanta-
<div n="lb"/>pañcakaṃ. Thus Mahāviṣṇu took his sixth incarna-
<div n="lb"/>tion as Paraśurāma and fulfilled his duty of destroying
<div n="lb"/>the wicked Kṣatriya Kings (For details about Paraśu-
<div n="lb"/>rāma see under Paraśurāma and Kārttavīryārjuna).
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, Chapter 16).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Śrī Rāmāvatāra.%} Mahāviṣṇu took the incarnation of
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Rāma to kill Rāvaṇa. (For further information see
<div n="lb"/>the words Śrī Rāma and Rāvaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Balabhadrarāmāvatāra.%} (The incarnation of Bala-
<div n="lb"/>bhadrarāma) (See the word Balabhadrarāma).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇāvatāra.%} (The incarnation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa) (See
<div n="lb"/>the word Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Kalkyavatāra (The incarnation as Kalki).%} At the end
<div n="lb"/>of Kaliyuga (the Age of Kali) all the people would
<div n="lb"/>become atheists and sceptics. Rewards will be received
<div n="lb"/>from the depraved. The classes will be mixed. People
<div n="lb"/>would become degenerate having no good qualities. A
<div n="lb"/>religion called ‘Vājasaneyam’ with its fifteen doctrines
<div n="lb"/>only will be acceptable. People would become irrespon-
<div n="lb"/>sible wearing the garment of duty. Lawless people
<div n="lb"/>would take the form of Kings and will begin to eat
<div n="lb"/>men. In those days Lord Viṣṇu will incarnate as Kalki,
<div n="lb"/>the son of Viṣṇuyaśas and the priest of Yājñavalkya and
<div n="lb"/>learn the arts of wielding weapon and handling missiles
<div n="lb"/>and destroy all lawless ones. The subjects will be
<div n="lb"/>brought back to the four classes and the four āśramas
<div n="lb"/>or stages of life and the doctrines and directions of the
<div n="lb"/>long-established religion and peace and order will be
[Page083-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>restored. Then the Lord will cast away the form of
<div n="lb"/>Kalki and go to heaven. After that, as of old, Kṛtayuga
<div n="lb"/>(the first age) will begin class distinctions and the four
<div n="lb"/>stages of life and such other establishments will once
<div n="lb"/>more prevail. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 16).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Incarnations of Mahāviṣṇu.%}
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Śrī Mahādevī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3 that Mahāviṣṇu had taken the twentysix
<div n="lb"/>incarnations given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) Sanaka 2) Sananda 3) Sanātana 4) Sanatkumāra
<div n="lb"/>5) Varāha (pig) 6) Nārada 7) Nara Nārāyaṇas 8)
<div n="lb"/>Kapila 9) Dattātreya 10) Yajña 11) Ṛṣabha 12) Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>13) Matsya (fish) 14) Mohinī 15) Kūrma (turtle)
<div n="lb"/>16) Garuḍa (eagle) 17) Dhanvantari 18) Narasiṃha
<div n="lb"/>(Lion-man) 19) Vāmana (dwarf) 20) Paraśurāma
<div n="lb"/>21) Vyāsa 22) Śrī Rāma 23) Balabhadrarāma 24)
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa 25) Buddha 26) Kalki. (Information about
<div n="lb"/>Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Narasiṃha, Vāmana and
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma, are given under the word Avatāra and
<div n="lb"/>for the rest see the same words).
<div n="NI"/>In the first Skandha of “Bhāgavata Kilippattu” the
<div n="lb"/>incarnations are exhaustively dealt with as follows:
<div n="NI"/>“And after that to make it possible for the Lord with
<div n="lb"/>four faces to rule his subjects justly and well. He took
<div n="lb"/>various incarnations with his portions, the first four of
<div n="lb"/>which are four persons, Sanaka, Sananda, Sanātana and
<div n="lb"/>Sanatkumāra, in the order given, four or five-year old
<div n="lb"/>children, well-versed in the four Vedas, the four always
<div n="lb"/>inseparable wandered everywhere come to the world
<div n="lb"/>to show the merits of Brahmacarya (the vow of celi-
<div n="lb"/>bacy). To kill Hiraṇyākṣa and to lift up the earth He
<div n="lb"/>took the form of Sūkara (Pig). To show the world the
<div n="lb"/>tattva (essence) of Sat (good) and tama (darkness)
<div n="lb"/>He took the form of hermit Nārada. To show the merits
<div n="lb"/>of penance He became Nara and Nārāyaṇa. To impart
<div n="lb"/>to the world the meaning of Sāṃkhya Yoga (Indian
<div n="lb"/>Philosophy dealing with evolution and union with the
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Spirit) He came as Kapila the learned. To
<div n="lb"/>teach the world the laws of chastisement He was
<div n="lb"/>born as Datta of the wife of Atri. Then He came as
<div n="lb"/>Yajña to become Indra. The next incarnation He took
<div n="lb"/>was Ṛṣabha, the noble King. To shorten and flatten
<div n="lb"/>the earth He came as Pṛthu. To recover the Vedas he
<div n="lb"/>took the form of Matsya (fish). To remove wrinkles and
<div n="lb"/>grey hair the gods had churned the sea of Milk and
<div n="lb"/>then to lift the mount Mandara He went under it and
<div n="lb"/>as a bird He got up on it. To give the world Āyurveda
<div n="lb"/>(the scripture of medicine) He came as Dhanvantari.
<div n="lb"/>To entice Asuras and to recover Ambrosia from them
<div n="lb"/>He took the form of Mohinī. To save the devoted
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda and to slay his father He came in the form of
<div n="lb"/>Narasiṃha. Then as Vāmana the younger brother of
<div n="lb"/>Indra to deceive Mahābali and to recover the lost worlds
<div n="lb"/>for the gods he came. To destroy the Kings who were
<div n="lb"/>haters of Brahmins He came as the son of Jama-
<div n="lb"/>dagni. Then he took the incarnation of Veda Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>And to slay the giant Rāvaṇa He became Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>Next we see Him as Balabhadrarāma. Then He came
<div n="lb"/>as Devakīsuta [son of Devakī (Kṛṣṇa)]. Next He came
<div n="lb"/>in the Kaliyuga as Śrī Buddha and at the end of Kali-
<div n="lb"/>yuga He will come as Kalki. And there are many in-
<div n="lb"/>carnations still to speak of.”
