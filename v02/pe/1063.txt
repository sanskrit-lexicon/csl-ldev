<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Duṣyanta was once hunting in the forests when
he hit a fawn with his arrow. The fawn fled to the
Āśrama of Kaṇva Muni and the king followed it. On
reaching the Āśrama grounds he saw Śakuntalā water-
ing the plants helped by her companions Anasūya and
Priyaṃvadā. Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā fell in love with
each other at first sight. Kaṇva was absent from the
Āśrama and they married according to the Gāndharva
rites and Śakuntalā became pregnant soon. The king
gave her his signet ring as a sign of faith and left for
his palace. When Duṣyanta left her Śakuntalā fell into
a deep reverie and she never knew about the arrival of
the arrogant sage, Durvāsas to the āśrama. Durvāsas
mistook her as disrespectful and cursed her saying that
she would be forgotten by the man of whom she was
thinking then. Śakuntalā never knew about the curse
also.

<div n="NI"/>Kaṇva Muni when he returned to the Āśrama and knew
everything, sent Śakuntalā to the palace of Duṣyanta.
But King Duṣyanta never recognised her and when
Śakuntalā was returning deeply grieved Menakā her
mother, took her and left her in the āśrama of Kaśyapa.
There Śakuntalā delivered a son. The boy grew brave
and fearless and he could subdue even the wildest of
animals around there. Kaśyapa, therefore, named him
Sarvadamana.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Duṣyanta was returning home after visiting
Indra he saw Śakuntalā, recognised her, and took her
and the boy to his palace. This was the boy who later
on became known as Bharata. (Chapter 73, Ādi Parva,
M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage and reign.%} Bharata was a partial incarna-
tion of Mahāviṣṇu. Even while he was young he became
a ruler and conquering the world destroyed the wicked.
Bharata had three wives. All the sons born to them
were bad and so the mothers killed them all. Aggrieved
over the loss of his sons he worshipped the devas to
get a son for him. At that time the great preceptor
Bṛhaspati forcibly married Mamatā the wife of his
brother. Mamatā was pregnant then and when she
conceived from Bṛhaspati also she bore two children.
On delivery she threw the child of Bṛhaspati in the
forests and went away with the other son.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas took care of the discarded child and named
him Bharadvāja and gave the child to Bharata. Bharata
gave the boy the name Vitatha (Dīrghatamas). Bharata
ruled over his land for twentyseven thousand years and
the land was, therefore, called Bhārata. (Śloka 96,
Chapter 2, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>After ruling the land ideally he left for the forests
entrusting the land to his son, Vitatha. (Navama
Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Vitatha also was called Bharata and he had five sons:
Suhotra, Suhota, Gaya, Garbha and Suketu. (Chapter
278, Agni Purāṇa).
