SŪRYA I¦. The God who gives light to the worlds.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} It is said that the Sun was born to
Kaśyapa by his wife Aditi. Mahāviṣṇu begot Brahmā
and Brahmā begot Marīci. Prajāpati Kaśyapa was
born from Marīci. Several sons were born to Kaśyapa
by Aditi the daughter of Dakṣa. They are known by
the names Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras and so on. Of these,
Ādityas are twelve in number. (Āditya means the son
of Aditi). There is a difference of opinion as to who
these twelve Ādityas are. According to Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 51, the twelve Ādityas are Varuṇa, Sūrya (the
Sun), Sahasrāṃśu, Dhātā, Tapana, Savitā, Gabhasti,
Ravi, Parjanya, Tvaṣṭā, Mitra and Viṣṇu. (See under
Dvādaśādityas). But in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 65, Stanza 15, it is stated that the twelve
Ādityas are Dhātā, Aryamā, Mitra, Śukra, Varuṇa,
Aṃśa, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā, Savitā Tvaṣṭā and
Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>Very often these names are used as synonyms of the Sun.
So it is better to assume that there are several Ādityas
and that it is the sun who gives light and heat to the
worlds. Vivasvān is this sun because it is said that from
this Vivasvān the Manu Vaivasvata was born and from
this Vaivasvata, Ikṣvāku, the first king of the Solar
dynasty, was born.
<div n="NI"/>2 {%The chariot of the Sun.%} The sun rises in the east and
sets in the west, in consequence of which days and
nights occur. The Purāṇic assumption is that the sun
travels in a very big chariot. The chariot of the Sun
is nine thousand yojanas long. The wheel is fixed to
this. The great wheel of time with three centres, five
tyres and six spokes, is fixed on that indestructible year.
It has seven horses, which are the seven Vedic metres,
called by the names Gāyatrī, Bṛhatī, Uṣṇik, Jagatī,
Tṛiṣṭubh, Anuṣṭubh and Paṅkti. Another axle used
for the chariot of the Sun is fortyfive thousand five
hundred yojanas long. The length of each half of the
Yoke is proportionate to the length of the axle. The
short axle of the chariot with the small half of the yoke
is fixed on Dhruva. The wheel fixed on the other axle
rests on the mount Mānasottara.
<div n="NI"/>Separate Ādityas, hermits Gandharvas, celestial maids,
Yakṣas, serpents and giants sit, in the chariot of the Sun
every month. In the month of Caitra, which is also
called Madhumāsa, the seven officers of the month who
travel daily in the chariot, are the Āditya Dhātā, the
celestial maid Kratusthalā, the hermit Pulastya, the
serpent Vāsuki, the Yakṣa Rathabhṛt, the giant Heti,
and the Gandharva Tumburu. In the month of
Vaiśākha also called Mādhava, the Āditya Aryaman,
the hermit Pulaha, the Yakṣa Rathaujas, the celestial
maid Puñjikasthalā, the giant Praheti, the serpent
Kacavīra and the Gandharva Nārada sit in the chariot.
In the month of Jyeṣṭha, the Āditya Mitra, the hermit
Atri, the serpent Takṣaka, giant Pauruṣeya, the celes-
[Page770-b+ 65]
tial maid Menakā, the Gandharva Hāhā, and the Yakṣa
Rathasvana, sit in the chariot. In the month of Āṣāḍha,
the Āditya Varuṇa, the hermit Vasiṣṭha, the serpent
Nāga, the celestial maid Sahajanyā, the Gandharva
Hūhū, the giant Ratha and the Yakṣa Citraratha,
travel in the chariot. In the month of Śrāvaṇa, the
Āditya Indra, the Gandharva, Viśvāvasu, the Yakṣa
Srotas, the serpent Elāputra, the hermit Aṅgiras, the
celestial maid Pramlocā, and the giant Sarpī travel in
the chariot. In the month of Bhādrapada the Āditya
Vivasvān, the Gandharva, Ugrasena, the hermit Bhṛgu,
the Yakṣa, Āpūraṇa, the celestial maid Anumlocā, the
serpent Śaṅkhapāla and the giant Vyāghra sit in the
chariot. In the month of Aśvanī, the Āditya Pūṣā,
the Gandharva Vasuruci, the giant Vāta, the hermit
Gautama, the serpent Dhanañjaya, the Yakṣa Suṣeṇa
and the celestial maid Ghṛtāci sit in the chariot. In
the month of Kārttika, the Gandharva is another
Viśvāvasu, the hermit Bharadvāja, Āditya Parjanya,
the serpent Airāvata, the celestial maid, Viśvācī, Yakṣa
Senajit and the giant Āpa, sit in the chariot. In the
month of Mārgaśīrṣa, the Āditya Aṃśa, the hermit
Kaśyapa, the Yakṣa Tārkṣya, the serpent Mahāpadma,
the celestial maid Urvaśī, the Gandharva Citrasena,
and the giant Vidyut travel in the chariot. In the
month of Pauṣa, the hermit Kratu, the Āditya Bhaga,
the Gandharva Ūrṇāyu, the giant Sphūrja,
the serpent Karkoṭaka, the Yakṣa Ariṣṭanemi and
the celestial maid Pūrvacitti travel in the chariot.
In the month of Māgha, the Āditya Tvaṣṭā, the
hermit Jamadagni, the serpent Kambala, the celes-
tial maid Tilottamā, the giant Brahmopeta, the Yakṣa
Ṛtajit and the Gandharva Dhṛtarāṣṭra sit in the chariot.
In the month of Phālguna the Āditya Viṣṇu, the serpent
Aśvatara, the celestial maid Rambhā, the Gandharva
Suvarcas, the Yakṣa Satyajit, the hermit Viśvāmitra, and
the giant Yajñopeta travel in the chariot. These seven
persons live in the region of the Sun in their time.
The hermits praise the Sun; the gandharvas sing; the
celestial maids dance; the giants walk behind as guards.
The serpents prepare the horses to be yoked; the
Yakṣas hold the bridle and the Bālakhilyas stand round
the Sun. These groups of seven in each month are
responsible for heat, coldness, rain etc. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Aṃśa 2, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Vedic figure of the Sun.%} Even though the sun is
only one of the seven groups, he is above the others in
prominence. The complete power of Viṣṇu is the three
Vedas Ṛg, Yajus and Sāma. The power in the form of
the three Vedas blazes in the form of the Sun. That
power destroys all the sins in the world. Viṣṇu stays
inside the sun in the form of Ṛg, Yajus and Sāma for
the Sustenance and protection of the world. As said be-
fore, the three Vedas are the parāśakti, or the feminine
supreme power of Viṣṇu. She is the three Vedas them-
selves. Every month she stays inside that particular
Āditya of the month. In the morning the Ṛgveda
praises the Sun. At noon the Yajurveda praises the Sun
and in the evening the Sāmans such as Bṛhad Rathantara
and so on. The three Vedas Ṛg, Yajus and Sāman are
portions of Viṣṇu. This power of Viṣṇu stays in Āditya
always. It stays not only in the Sun, but also in the
three godheads Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. At the time
of creation Brahmā was pervaded by Ṛg. At the time
of sustenance, Viṣṇu is pervaded by Yajus. At the end
[Page771-a+ 65]
Rudra will be pervaded by Sāman. So the sound of
Sāman will be unpalatable. Thus this Vaiṣṇavite power
which is having the attribute of purity (Sattva) and
Vedas, pervades mainly the sun though it remains
on the seven groups also. Being the seat of this power,
the Sun blazes with his rays and destroys the darkness
in all the worlds.
<div n="NI"/>Such a Sun is praised by the hermits. The Gandharvas
sing in front of the Sun. The celestial maids dance
before him. The giants guard him, the serpents prepare
his chariot, the Yakṣas hold the bridle and the Bāla-
khilyas stand around him. Viṣṇu who is having
the figure of the Sun pervaded by the power of the
Vedas, never rises or sets. The seven groups are separate
from that Viṣṇu. As the figures of those who approach,
are reflected in a mirror fixed on a post, that power of
Viṣṇu, without separating itself from that chariot,
pervades them who come every month in turn. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The direction of the sun.%} The Sun starts from the
east and goes to the western ocean. The directions east
and west originate from this rising and setting. As a
matter of fact when the sun rises in the east it is bright
in places behind it. But it does not shine in the palace
of Brahmā on the top of Mahāmeru. The rays of the
sun which enter the palace are driven back by the
radiance of the palace. The Mountain Meru is north to
all islands and countries. So on one side of that mount
it is always day and on the other side it is always night.
When the Sun sets his light enters fire. So at night the
light of fire goes far. In the same way, at day time, the
light of fire enters the sun. So the sun shines more. Thus
because the light of the sun and fire enter each other
the day and the night wax when the sun shines on
the southern and northern hemi-spheres. The dark nights
and bright days enter water gradually. The water seems
a little red, in day time because darkness has entered
it in the night. After sunset the water seems a little
white because the day has entered the water.
<div n="NI"/>Thus when the sun passes through the middle of the island
Puṣkara, the change of the Sun to one thirtieth
portion of the earth is called ‘Mauhūrtikagati’ (covering
the distance in a muhūrta—48 minutes). The sun, like
a fly sitting on the circumference of the wheel of a potter
travels round the earth inclining a portion of a thirtieth of
the earth, and making day and night. In the beginning
of the transit to the Tropic of Cancer, the sun passes
into the zodiac of Makara, and then to Kumbha and
Mīna. After having completed the three zodiacs, the
sun makes the day and night equal and enters Viṣuva.
At the end of travelling in the Northern hemi-sphere
the sun enters the zodiac of Karkaṭaka and transit to
the south begins. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The Sun in the clutches of the giants.%} The Sun is being
attacked daily by a kind of giants called the Mandehas.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Family life.%} The Sun married Saṃjñā, the daughter
of Viśvakarmā. Three children Manu, Yama and
Yamī were born to him by Saṃjñā. By Chāyā, the
maid of Saṃjñā, three children, Śanaiścara, Manu and
Tapatī were born to the Sun. Aśvinīkumāras and Revan-
ta were born by Saṃjñā to the sun who took the form of
a horse. (See under Saṃjñā and Chāyā).
<div n="NI"/>On several occasions other sons such as Sugrīva, Kālindī
Karṇa and so on were born to the Sun. (For details see
under those entries).
[Page771-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The rising delayed.%} A story stating that the rising of
the sun was delayed because of the curse of Śīlavatī, is
stated in Mahābhārata. (See under Śīlavatī).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The Sun and the Syamantaka.%} Once the King Satrājit
did penance and got the jewel Syamantaka from the Sun.
(For detailed story see under Prasena).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The Sun and Rāhu.%} Once the Sun and the moon
pointed out Rāhu who had come to partake of the
Amṛta (Ambrosia) in stealth and Mahaviṣṇu cut off his
head. (For detailed story see under Amṛta, Para 4).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The Sun the teacher of Hanūmān.%} The Sun is the
teacher of Hanūmān. (See under Hanūmān).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%The Sun and Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa happened to
reach the Solar region, while he was conducting regional
conquest. That night he rested on Mahāmeru, and then
got into his plane Puṣpaka, ready for fight in the
morning. Seeing the Sun rising up, Rāvaṇa called his
minister Prahasta and said to him. “Minister, go and
convey my words to the Sun. ‘Rāvaṇa has come to fight.
Either get down and fight or admit defeat.’ Prahasta
walked towards the sun and told the words of the King
to the two gate-keepers Piṅgala and Daṇḍī. The Sun
was informed of this by Daṇḍī. The Sun told Daṇḍī
thus: “Daṇḍī, I don't mind whether I defeat or I am
defeated by Rāvaṇa. The thing is, that I have no time.”
Daṇḍī informed Rāvaṇa of this. Rāvaṇa went away
shouting that he had defeated the Sun.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Fight with Śiva.%} See under Śiva Para 7, Sub
para 7.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%The Sun lost his lustre.%} See under Sukeśa.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Artificial Sun.%} See under Brahmā, para 13.
<div n="NI"/>15) {%The Sun and Karṇa.%} See under Karṇa.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%The hermit Atri and the Sun.%} See under Atri, para 4.
<div n="NI"/>17) {%The names of the Sun.%} Once the hermit Dhaumya
repeated to Dharmaputra the one hundred and eight
names of the Sun. Those names are given in Mahā-
bhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 3.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once Pāñcālī worshipped the Sun. The Sun created
an unseen giant for her protection. (M.B. Virāṭa
Parva, Chapter 15, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Pāñcālī did penance before the Sun and procured
the ‘Akṣayapātra’ (the pot that never became empty).
(See under Akṣayapātra).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The Sun destroys the ungrateful asuras (demons).
(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 108, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) There is a story connecting the Sun and the South.
In days of old the Sun performed a sacrifice according
to the Vedas, and to Kaśyapa who was the ministerial
priest, he gave the South as dakṣiṇā (offering). So the
south got the name ‘Dakṣiṇa’. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
Chapter 109, Verse 1).
<div n="NI"/>(v) The west is the place where the Sun pours his rays
after the end of the day. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
110, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) When Karṇa and Arjuna confronted each other
in the battle of Bhārata, the Sun boasted to Indra that
Karṇa would come out victorious. (M.B. Karṇa Parva,
Chapter 87, Stanza 57).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) The Sun gave Subrahmaṇya two attendants
named Subhrāja and Bhāsvara. (Śalya Parva, Chapter
45, Verse 31).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Once Śiva anointed the Sun as the King of all
the planets. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 112, Stanza
31).
[Page772-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ix) The Sun once gave Yājñavalkya the boon that he
would get knowledge of the Vedas. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 318, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(x) The story of one who had attained the region of
the Sun by ‘Uñchavṛtti’ (Living on the grains fallen on
the field) is given in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, a few
Chapters from 353, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>There was a Brahmin in a place called Mahāpadma on
the banks of the Ganges. He wandered here and there
for knowledge of Vedas. Once a hermit met him and
directed him towards a Nāga named Padmanābha.
Padmanābha is the serpent which supports the chariot
of the Sun. The Brahmin-hermit started in search of
Padmanābha. At last he found out his house. But
there was the wife of Padmanābha only. She said that
her husband would return within a few days. Accord-
ingly he remained on the banks of the Ganges without
any food. Padmanābha returned and both of them met
together. The hermit asked the nāga what he should
do in order to get merged in God. The Nāga replied
that he could become one with God by Uñchavṛtti. The
Nāga continued. “The Sun is a god who had invoked
into himself a saint who had lived only by the fallen
grains in the field. The activities of that Sun are wonder-
ful. The hermits and saints attach themselves to the
rays of the Sun as birds attach themselves to the
branches of trees. The great storms arising from the
Sun spread wide in the sky. I saw once a person sitting
inside that Sun who was a wonder of wonders. When
that person as shining as the Sun came to him in the
noon the Sun embraced him and seated him inside him.
I asked him who he was. The Sun replied that he was
a person who had attained heaven by Uñchavṛtti.”
Hearing the advice given by the Nāga, the Brahmin
engaged in Uñchavṛtti and attained heaven.
<div n="NI"/>(xi) The Sun gave Subrahmaṇya shining beauty.
(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 86, Verse 23).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) The Sun gave the hermit Jamadagni an umbrella
and slippers. (See under Cherippu).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) In olden days when a war between the Devas
and the Asuras was drawing near, Rāhu wounded the
Sun and the moon. Along with that the universe fell
in darkness, and the asuras began to destroy the Devas.
At this time according to the prayer of the gods the
hermit Atri assumed the figure of the Moon and made
the Sun as shining as of old. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 156, Stanza 2).
