SŪRYA I¦. The God who gives light to the worlds.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} It is said that the Sun was born to
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa by his wife Aditi. Mahāviṣṇu begot Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and Brahmā begot Marīci. Prajāpati Kaśyapa was
<div n="lb"/>born from Marīci. Several sons were born to Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>by Aditi the daughter of Dakṣa. They are known by
<div n="lb"/>the names Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras and so on. Of these,
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas are twelve in number. (Āditya means the son
<div n="lb"/>of Aditi). There is a difference of opinion as to who
<div n="lb"/>these twelve Ādityas are. According to Agni Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 51, the twelve Ādityas are Varuṇa, Sūrya (the
<div n="lb"/>Sun), Sahasrāṃśu, Dhātā, Tapana, Savitā, Gabhasti,
<div n="lb"/>Ravi, Parjanya, Tvaṣṭā, Mitra and Viṣṇu. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Dvādaśādityas). But in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 65, Stanza 15, it is stated that the twelve
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas are Dhātā, Aryamā, Mitra, Śukra, Varuṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśa, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā, Savitā Tvaṣṭā and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>Very often these names are used as synonyms of the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>So it is better to assume that there are several Ādityas
<div n="lb"/>and that it is the sun who gives light and heat to the
<div n="lb"/>worlds. Vivasvān is this sun because it is said that from
<div n="lb"/>this Vivasvān the Manu Vaivasvata was born and from
<div n="lb"/>this Vaivasvata, Ikṣvāku, the first king of the Solar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty, was born.
<div n="NI"/>2 {%The chariot of the Sun.%} The sun rises in the east and
<div n="lb"/>sets in the west, in consequence of which days and
<div n="lb"/>nights occur. The Purāṇic assumption is that the sun
<div n="lb"/>travels in a very big chariot. The chariot of the Sun
<div n="lb"/>is nine thousand yojanas long. The wheel is fixed to
<div n="lb"/>this. The great wheel of time with three centres, five
<div n="lb"/>tyres and six spokes, is fixed on that indestructible year.
<div n="lb"/>It has seven horses, which are the seven Vedic metres,
<div n="lb"/>called by the names Gāyatrī, Bṛhatī, Uṣṇik, Jagatī,
<div n="lb"/>Tṛiṣṭubh, Anuṣṭubh and Paṅkti. Another axle used
<div n="lb"/>for the chariot of the Sun is fortyfive thousand five
<div n="lb"/>hundred yojanas long. The length of each half of the
<div n="lb"/>Yoke is proportionate to the length of the axle. The
<div n="lb"/>short axle of the chariot with the small half of the yoke
<div n="lb"/>is fixed on Dhruva. The wheel fixed on the other axle
<div n="lb"/>rests on the mount Mānasottara.
<div n="NI"/>Separate Ādityas, hermits Gandharvas, celestial maids,
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas, serpents and giants sit, in the chariot of the Sun
<div n="lb"/>every month. In the month of Caitra, which is also
<div n="lb"/>called Madhumāsa, the seven officers of the month who
<div n="lb"/>travel daily in the chariot, are the Āditya Dhātā, the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maid Kratusthalā, the hermit Pulastya, the
<div n="lb"/>serpent Vāsuki, the Yakṣa Rathabhṛt, the giant Heti,
<div n="lb"/>and the Gandharva Tumburu. In the month of
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśākha also called Mādhava, the Āditya Aryaman,
<div n="lb"/>the hermit Pulaha, the Yakṣa Rathaujas, the celestial
<div n="lb"/>maid Puñjikasthalā, the giant Praheti, the serpent
<div n="lb"/>Kacavīra and the Gandharva Nārada sit in the chariot.
<div n="lb"/>In the month of Jyeṣṭha, the Āditya Mitra, the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Atri, the serpent Takṣaka, giant Pauruṣeya, the celes-
[Page770-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>tial maid Menakā, the Gandharva Hāhā, and the Yakṣa
<div n="lb"/>Rathasvana, sit in the chariot. In the month of Āṣāḍha,
<div n="lb"/>the Āditya Varuṇa, the hermit Vasiṣṭha, the serpent
<div n="lb"/>Nāga, the celestial maid Sahajanyā, the Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>Hūhū, the giant Ratha and the Yakṣa Citraratha,
<div n="lb"/>travel in the chariot. In the month of Śrāvaṇa, the
<div n="lb"/>Āditya Indra, the Gandharva, Viśvāvasu, the Yakṣa
<div n="lb"/>Srotas, the serpent Elāputra, the hermit Aṅgiras, the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maid Pramlocā, and the giant Sarpī travel in
<div n="lb"/>the chariot. In the month of Bhādrapada the Āditya
<div n="lb"/>Vivasvān, the Gandharva, Ugrasena, the hermit Bhṛgu,
<div n="lb"/>the Yakṣa, Āpūraṇa, the celestial maid Anumlocā, the
<div n="lb"/>serpent Śaṅkhapāla and the giant Vyāghra sit in the
<div n="lb"/>chariot. In the month of Aśvanī, the Āditya Pūṣā,
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharva Vasuruci, the giant Vāta, the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Gautama, the serpent Dhanañjaya, the Yakṣa Suṣeṇa
<div n="lb"/>and the celestial maid Ghṛtāci sit in the chariot. In
<div n="lb"/>the month of Kārttika, the Gandharva is another
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāvasu, the hermit Bharadvāja, Āditya Parjanya,
<div n="lb"/>the serpent Airāvata, the celestial maid, Viśvācī, Yakṣa
<div n="lb"/>Senajit and the giant Āpa, sit in the chariot. In the
<div n="lb"/>month of Mārgaśīrṣa, the Āditya Aṃśa, the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa, the Yakṣa Tārkṣya, the serpent Mahāpadma,
<div n="lb"/>the celestial maid Urvaśī, the Gandharva Citrasena,
<div n="lb"/>and the giant Vidyut travel in the chariot. In the
<div n="lb"/>month of Pauṣa, the hermit Kratu, the Āditya Bhaga,
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharva Ūrṇāyu, the giant Sphūrja,
<div n="lb"/>the serpent Karkoṭaka, the Yakṣa Ariṣṭanemi and
<div n="lb"/>the celestial maid Pūrvacitti travel in the chariot.
<div n="lb"/>In the month of Māgha, the Āditya Tvaṣṭā, the
<div n="lb"/>hermit Jamadagni, the serpent Kambala, the celes-
<div n="lb"/>tial maid Tilottamā, the giant Brahmopeta, the Yakṣa
<div n="lb"/>Ṛtajit and the Gandharva Dhṛtarāṣṭra sit in the chariot.
<div n="lb"/>In the month of Phālguna the Āditya Viṣṇu, the serpent
<div n="lb"/>Aśvatara, the celestial maid Rambhā, the Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>Suvarcas, the Yakṣa Satyajit, the hermit Viśvāmitra, and
<div n="lb"/>the giant Yajñopeta travel in the chariot. These seven
<div n="lb"/>persons live in the region of the Sun in their time.
<div n="lb"/>The hermits praise the Sun; the gandharvas sing; the
<div n="lb"/>celestial maids dance; the giants walk behind as guards.
<div n="lb"/>The serpents prepare the horses to be yoked; the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas hold the bridle and the Bālakhilyas stand round
<div n="lb"/>the Sun. These groups of seven in each month are
<div n="lb"/>responsible for heat, coldness, rain etc. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśa 2, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Vedic figure of the Sun.%} Even though the sun is
<div n="lb"/>only one of the seven groups, he is above the others in
<div n="lb"/>prominence. The complete power of Viṣṇu is the three
<div n="lb"/>Vedas Ṛg, Yajus and Sāma. The power in the form of
<div n="lb"/>the three Vedas blazes in the form of the Sun. That
<div n="lb"/>power destroys all the sins in the world. Viṣṇu stays
<div n="lb"/>inside the sun in the form of Ṛg, Yajus and Sāma for
<div n="lb"/>the Sustenance and protection of the world. As said be-
<div n="lb"/>fore, the three Vedas are the parāśakti, or the feminine
<div n="lb"/>supreme power of Viṣṇu. She is the three Vedas them-
<div n="lb"/>selves. Every month she stays inside that particular
<div n="lb"/>Āditya of the month. In the morning the Ṛgveda
<div n="lb"/>praises the Sun. At noon the Yajurveda praises the Sun
<div n="lb"/>and in the evening the Sāmans such as Bṛhad Rathantara
<div n="lb"/>and so on. The three Vedas Ṛg, Yajus and Sāman are
<div n="lb"/>portions of Viṣṇu. This power of Viṣṇu stays in Āditya
<div n="lb"/>always. It stays not only in the Sun, but also in the
<div n="lb"/>three godheads Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. At the time
<div n="lb"/>of creation Brahmā was pervaded by Ṛg. At the time
<div n="lb"/>of sustenance, Viṣṇu is pervaded by Yajus. At the end
[Page771-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Rudra will be pervaded by Sāman. So the sound of
<div n="lb"/>Sāman will be unpalatable. Thus this Vaiṣṇavite power
<div n="lb"/>which is having the attribute of purity (Sattva) and
<div n="lb"/>Vedas, pervades mainly the sun though it remains
<div n="lb"/>on the seven groups also. Being the seat of this power,
<div n="lb"/>the Sun blazes with his rays and destroys the darkness
<div n="lb"/>in all the worlds.
<div n="NI"/>Such a Sun is praised by the hermits. The Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>sing in front of the Sun. The celestial maids dance
<div n="lb"/>before him. The giants guard him, the serpents prepare
<div n="lb"/>his chariot, the Yakṣas hold the bridle and the Bāla-
<div n="lb"/>khilyas stand around him. Viṣṇu who is having
<div n="lb"/>the figure of the Sun pervaded by the power of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas, never rises or sets. The seven groups are separate
<div n="lb"/>from that Viṣṇu. As the figures of those who approach,
<div n="lb"/>are reflected in a mirror fixed on a post, that power of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu, without separating itself from that chariot,
<div n="lb"/>pervades them who come every month in turn. (Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The direction of the sun.%} The Sun starts from the
<div n="lb"/>east and goes to the western ocean. The directions east
<div n="lb"/>and west originate from this rising and setting. As a
<div n="lb"/>matter of fact when the sun rises in the east it is bright
<div n="lb"/>in places behind it. But it does not shine in the palace
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā on the top of Mahāmeru. The rays of the
<div n="lb"/>sun which enter the palace are driven back by the
<div n="lb"/>radiance of the palace. The Mountain Meru is north to
<div n="lb"/>all islands and countries. So on one side of that mount
<div n="lb"/>it is always day and on the other side it is always night.
<div n="lb"/>When the Sun sets his light enters fire. So at night the
<div n="lb"/>light of fire goes far. In the same way, at day time, the
<div n="lb"/>light of fire enters the sun. So the sun shines more. Thus
<div n="lb"/>because the light of the sun and fire enter each other
<div n="lb"/>the day and the night wax when the sun shines on
<div n="lb"/>the southern and northern hemi-spheres. The dark nights
<div n="lb"/>and bright days enter water gradually. The water seems
<div n="lb"/>a little red, in day time because darkness has entered
<div n="lb"/>it in the night. After sunset the water seems a little
<div n="lb"/>white because the day has entered the water.
<div n="NI"/>Thus when the sun passes through the middle of the island
<div n="lb"/>Puṣkara, the change of the Sun to one thirtieth
<div n="lb"/>portion of the earth is called ‘Mauhūrtikagati’ (covering
<div n="lb"/>the distance in a muhūrta—48 minutes). The sun, like
<div n="lb"/>a fly sitting on the circumference of the wheel of a potter
<div n="lb"/>travels round the earth inclining a portion of a thirtieth of
<div n="lb"/>the earth, and making day and night. In the beginning
<div n="lb"/>of the transit to the Tropic of Cancer, the sun passes
<div n="lb"/>into the zodiac of Makara, and then to Kumbha and
<div n="lb"/>Mīna. After having completed the three zodiacs, the
<div n="lb"/>sun makes the day and night equal and enters Viṣuva.
<div n="lb"/>At the end of travelling in the Northern hemi-sphere
<div n="lb"/>the sun enters the zodiac of Karkaṭaka and transit to
<div n="lb"/>the south begins. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The Sun in the clutches of the giants.%} The Sun is being
<div n="lb"/>attacked daily by a kind of giants called the Mandehas.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Family life.%} The Sun married Saṃjñā, the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvakarmā. Three children Manu, Yama and
<div n="lb"/>Yamī were born to him by Saṃjñā. By Chāyā, the
<div n="lb"/>maid of Saṃjñā, three children, Śanaiścara, Manu and
<div n="lb"/>Tapatī were born to the Sun. Aśvinīkumāras and Revan-
<div n="lb"/>ta were born by Saṃjñā to the sun who took the form of
<div n="lb"/>a horse. (See under Saṃjñā and Chāyā).
<div n="NI"/>On several occasions other sons such as Sugrīva, Kālindī
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa and so on were born to the Sun. (For details see
<div n="lb"/>under those entries).
[Page771-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The rising delayed.%} A story stating that the rising of
<div n="lb"/>the sun was delayed because of the curse of Śīlavatī, is
<div n="lb"/>stated in Mahābhārata. (See under Śīlavatī).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The Sun and the Syamantaka.%} Once the King Satrājit
<div n="lb"/>did penance and got the jewel Syamantaka from the Sun.
<div n="lb"/>(For detailed story see under Prasena).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The Sun and Rāhu.%} Once the Sun and the moon
<div n="lb"/>pointed out Rāhu who had come to partake of the
<div n="lb"/>Amṛta (Ambrosia) in stealth and Mahaviṣṇu cut off his
<div n="lb"/>head. (For detailed story see under Amṛta, Para 4).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The Sun the teacher of Hanūmān.%} The Sun is the
<div n="lb"/>teacher of Hanūmān. (See under Hanūmān).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%The Sun and Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa happened to
<div n="lb"/>reach the Solar region, while he was conducting regional
<div n="lb"/>conquest. That night he rested on Mahāmeru, and then
<div n="lb"/>got into his plane Puṣpaka, ready for fight in the
<div n="lb"/>morning. Seeing the Sun rising up, Rāvaṇa called his
<div n="lb"/>minister Prahasta and said to him. “Minister, go and
<div n="lb"/>convey my words to the Sun. ‘Rāvaṇa has come to fight.
<div n="lb"/>Either get down and fight or admit defeat.’ Prahasta
<div n="lb"/>walked towards the sun and told the words of the King
<div n="lb"/>to the two gate-keepers Piṅgala and Daṇḍī. The Sun
<div n="lb"/>was informed of this by Daṇḍī. The Sun told Daṇḍī
<div n="lb"/>thus: “Daṇḍī, I don't mind whether I defeat or I am
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Rāvaṇa. The thing is, that I have no time.”
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍī informed Rāvaṇa of this. Rāvaṇa went away
<div n="lb"/>shouting that he had defeated the Sun.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Fight with Śiva.%} See under Śiva Para 7, Sub
<div n="lb"/>para 7.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%The Sun lost his lustre.%} See under Sukeśa.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Artificial Sun.%} See under Brahmā, para 13.
<div n="NI"/>15) {%The Sun and Karṇa.%} See under Karṇa.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%The hermit Atri and the Sun.%} See under Atri, para 4.
<div n="NI"/>17) {%The names of the Sun.%} Once the hermit Dhaumya
<div n="lb"/>repeated to Dharmaputra the one hundred and eight
<div n="lb"/>names of the Sun. Those names are given in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 3.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once Pāñcālī worshipped the Sun. The Sun created
<div n="lb"/>an unseen giant for her protection. (M.B. Virāṭa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 15, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Pāñcālī did penance before the Sun and procured
<div n="lb"/>the ‘Akṣayapātra’ (the pot that never became empty).
<div n="lb"/>(See under Akṣayapātra).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The Sun destroys the ungrateful asuras (demons).
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 108, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) There is a story connecting the Sun and the South.
<div n="lb"/>In days of old the Sun performed a sacrifice according
<div n="lb"/>to the Vedas, and to Kaśyapa who was the ministerial
<div n="lb"/>priest, he gave the South as dakṣiṇā (offering). So the
<div n="lb"/>south got the name ‘Dakṣiṇa’. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 109, Verse 1).
<div n="NI"/>(v) The west is the place where the Sun pours his rays
<div n="lb"/>after the end of the day. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>110, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) When Karṇa and Arjuna confronted each other
<div n="lb"/>in the battle of Bhārata, the Sun boasted to Indra that
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa would come out victorious. (M.B. Karṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 87, Stanza 57).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) The Sun gave Subrahmaṇya two attendants
<div n="lb"/>named Subhrāja and Bhāsvara. (Śalya Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>45, Verse 31).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Once Śiva anointed the Sun as the King of all
<div n="lb"/>the planets. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 112, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>31).
[Page772-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ix) The Sun once gave Yājñavalkya the boon that he
<div n="lb"/>would get knowledge of the Vedas. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 318, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>(x) The story of one who had attained the region of
<div n="lb"/>the Sun by ‘Uñchavṛtti’ (Living on the grains fallen on
<div n="lb"/>the field) is given in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, a few
<div n="lb"/>Chapters from 353, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>There was a Brahmin in a place called Mahāpadma on
<div n="lb"/>the banks of the Ganges. He wandered here and there
<div n="lb"/>for knowledge of Vedas. Once a hermit met him and
<div n="lb"/>directed him towards a Nāga named Padmanābha.
<div n="lb"/>Padmanābha is the serpent which supports the chariot
<div n="lb"/>of the Sun. The Brahmin-hermit started in search of
<div n="lb"/>Padmanābha. At last he found out his house. But
<div n="lb"/>there was the wife of Padmanābha only. She said that
<div n="lb"/>her husband would return within a few days. Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ingly he remained on the banks of the Ganges without
<div n="lb"/>any food. Padmanābha returned and both of them met
<div n="lb"/>together. The hermit asked the nāga what he should
<div n="lb"/>do in order to get merged in God. The Nāga replied
<div n="lb"/>that he could become one with God by Uñchavṛtti. The
<div n="lb"/>Nāga continued. “The Sun is a god who had invoked
<div n="lb"/>into himself a saint who had lived only by the fallen
<div n="lb"/>grains in the field. The activities of that Sun are wonder-
<div n="lb"/>ful. The hermits and saints attach themselves to the
<div n="lb"/>rays of the Sun as birds attach themselves to the
<div n="lb"/>branches of trees. The great storms arising from the
<div n="lb"/>Sun spread wide in the sky. I saw once a person sitting
<div n="lb"/>inside that Sun who was a wonder of wonders. When
<div n="lb"/>that person as shining as the Sun came to him in the
<div n="lb"/>noon the Sun embraced him and seated him inside him.
<div n="lb"/>I asked him who he was. The Sun replied that he was
<div n="lb"/>a person who had attained heaven by Uñchavṛtti.”
<div n="lb"/>Hearing the advice given by the Nāga, the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>engaged in Uñchavṛtti and attained heaven.
<div n="NI"/>(xi) The Sun gave Subrahmaṇya shining beauty.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 86, Verse 23).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) The Sun gave the hermit Jamadagni an umbrella
<div n="lb"/>and slippers. (See under Cherippu).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) In olden days when a war between the Devas
<div n="lb"/>and the Asuras was drawing near, Rāhu wounded the
<div n="lb"/>Sun and the moon. Along with that the universe fell
<div n="lb"/>in darkness, and the asuras began to destroy the Devas.
<div n="lb"/>At this time according to the prayer of the gods the
<div n="lb"/>hermit Atri assumed the figure of the Moon and made
<div n="lb"/>the Sun as shining as of old. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 156, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) The Synonyms of Sun according to the Amarakośa
