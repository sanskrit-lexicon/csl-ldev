ŚĀKHA¦. According to one view Śākha was the
younger brother of Subrahmaṇya while there are others
who maintain that he was Subrahmaṇya's son. In verse
37, Chapter 44 of Śalya Parva it is stated that Śākha
was the son of the Vasu Anala and the younger
brother of Subrahmaṇya and that he had two brothers
called Vaiśākha and Naigameya. It is stated in
Chapter 15, part 1 of Viṣṇu Purāṇa as follows:- “Āpa,
Dhruva, Soma, Dharma, Anila, Agni, Pratyūṣa and
Prabhāsa are the aṣṭavasus. Vaitaṇḍa, Śrama, Śānta,
and Dhvani were sons of Āpa. Kāla, who annihilates
the entire world is the son of Dhruva and Varccas is
Soma's son. Varccas gives people the vital glow.
Draviṇa, Hutahavyavaha, Śiśvara, Prāṇa and Varuṇa
were the sons of Dharma by Manoharā. Anila's wife
was Śivā, and two sons, Manojava and Avijñatagati
were born to the couple. Kumāra, son of Agni was born
in Śarastamba and he had three brothers called Śākha,
Viśākha and Naigameya.”
<div n="NI"/>The following story about the birth of Śākha is from
Taraṅga 6, Lāvāṇakalambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara:
Defeated in battle by Tārakāsura, Indra decided to
have no more fight with him and retired to Mount
Mahāmeru. Devas and maharṣis sought asylum with
Subrahmaṇya, who gave them protection. Indra
came to know of it and fought with Subrahmaṇya
feeling that the latter had captured his kingdom. Two
sons, Śākha and Viśākha were born from the face of
Subrahmaṇya wounded by the Vajrāyudha of Indra.
