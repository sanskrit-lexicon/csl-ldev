SUTAPAS VI¦. A hermit who was born in the dynasty
<div n="lb"/>of Bharadvāja. This hermit had two wives. A son
<div n="lb"/>named Kalyāṇamitra was born by Pitṛkanyakā, one
<div n="lb"/>of the two wives.
<div n="NI"/>The glamour of the second wife of Sutapas attracted
<div n="lb"/>the sun, who raped her once and from this, the son
<div n="lb"/>Aśvinīsuta was born. On seeing that his wife was a
<div n="lb"/>harlot, Sutapas abandoned her with her son. After-
<div n="lb"/>wards, at the instance of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the hermit
<div n="lb"/>received his wife and her son back. (Brahmavaivarta: 1:
<div n="lb"/>11).
