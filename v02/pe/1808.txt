DEVADŪTA¦. A messenger of the Devas. When Dharma-
putra refused to live in heaven without his brothers
like Karṇa it was this Devadūta with whom Indra sent
Dharmaputra to Karṇa and others. (M.B. Svargā-
rohaṇa Parva, Chapter 2, Verse 14). This Devadūta
is to be meditated upon at dawn and before sun-set
