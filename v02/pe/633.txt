AUŚANAS¦ (Kapālamocana). A holy place on the
banks of the river, Sarasvatī. Brahmā, the devas and
many maharṣis lived here once. (Chapter 83, Vana
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>This place is called Kapālamocana also. There is a
story behind the place getting this name.
<div n="NI"/>At the forest of Daṇḍaka Śrī Rāma killed many demons.
The force of the arrows took the skulls of the demons
to far off places in the forest. One of the skulls thus
sent far fell on the feet of a sage named Mahodara
who was then going that way. The skull went deep
into his foot and not only did it wound his foot
but it stuck to his foot so hard that it could not
be drawn out also. With his foot in pains the sage
visited all the holy places but with no relief to his pain.
At last Mahodara came to Auśanasa and to his surprise
the skull came off from his foot healing his wound. He
remained there for some time and obtained many divine
attainments. From then onwards the place was called
‘Kapālamocana’. After this incident Brahmā, Viśvāmitra,
Balabhadrarāma and many such divine persons visited
the place. (Chapter 39, Śalya Parva, M.B.)
