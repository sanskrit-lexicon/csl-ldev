DHṚṢṬABUDDHI¦. A Vaiśya who attained heaven by
performing the fast of Vaiśākha Vrata. He lived in the
country of Bhadrāvatī, on the bank of the River
Sarasvatī. The name of the king of the country was
Dhṛtimān. Dhanapāla, a Vaiśya of that country had
five sons: Sumanas, Dyutimān, Medhāvī, Sukṛta and
Dhṛṣṭabuddhi. The last of them turned out to be a
wicked man. Going after many women, keeping
company with wicked people, gambling, wandering
about in search of harlots, not venerating Gods, Manes
or Brāhmaṇas, wasting the money of his father, eating
untouchable food, drinking liquor and such other acts,
he indulged in. Once he was seen walking in the
street with his hand on the shoulder of a harlot. So his
father turned him out of the house. He was discarded
by his relatives too. He sold the ornaments he had on
his body. When that was finished the harlots also
evaded him. He became a destitute having no money
or clothes. When he became tired with hunger and
thirst he began stealing in that city. The King's men
caught him. They chained him and scourged him.
Finally, he went to the forest and with a bow and
arrows he lived by hunting.
<div n="NI"/>Dhṛṣṭabuddhi happened to reach the hermitage of
Kauṇḍinya. It was the month of Vaiśākha. While
Kauṇḍinya was coming from the Ganges, having taken
bath, a drop of water fell on Dhṛṣṭabuddhi from the
wet cloth of the hermit, and consequently his sins were
washed off. He fell before the hermit and requested
him to instruct him in the way of attaining heaven.

The hermit advised him to observe the fast of Vaiśākha-
śuklaikādaśī known as Mohinī. Accordingly he observed
the fast and became sinless. Invested with a divine form
he entered the realm of Viṣṇu. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara
Khaṇḍa, Chapter 51).
