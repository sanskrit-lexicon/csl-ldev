TṚṆABINDU II¦. A sage. This sage sat and did
penance at a place called Ṛṣitīrtha. (Chapter 20,
Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Grandfather of Viśravas.%} Viśravas, father of Rāvaṇa
was the son of Māninī, daughter of Tṛṇabindu. There
is a story about him in Uttara Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once the sage Pulastya was doing penance in a seclud-
ed place in the Himālayas when a few Deva Gandharva
women came to that place and disturbed his penance
by their dances and noise. The angered sage gave a
curse to that place saying that any woman coming to
that place would become pregnant. Māninī, daughter
of Tṛṇabindu went to this place unaware of the curse
and got pregnant. She came weeping to her father and
Tṛṇabindu immediately took his daughter to Pulastya
and asked him to marry Māninī. Pulastya married
Māninī and Viśravas was born to her.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he cursed Hanūmān.%} Once Hanūmān caught
hold of a lion and elephant in fight and tied them
each to a post on the two sides of the āśrama of
Tṛṇabindu. When the sage stepped out from the
hermitage, he was for a moment frightened by the sight
of two mighty animals on the sides of his āśrama and
knew by his divine powers that the perpetrator of that
deed was Hanūmān and so he cursed him saying that
he would lose all his divine powers forthwith.
Hanūmān begged for relief and the sage said that he
would regain his powers at the time of his going in
search of Sītā when another member of his species
would remind him of his lost divine powers. Hanūmān
remained oblivious of his powers till the time when the
monkeys were trying to leap to Laṅkā from the
Mahendra mountain on the shores of Bhārata. Jāmba-
vān, a mighty monkey chief called Hanūmān to his
side and made him understand the great powers latent
in him. From that moment onwards Hanūmān regained
his lost powers and became his old self. (See under
Hanūmān).
