TṚṆABINDU II¦. A sage. This sage sat and did
<div n="lb"/>penance at a place called Ṛṣitīrtha. (Chapter 20,
<div n="lb"/>Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Grandfather of Viśravas.%} Viśravas, father of Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Māninī, daughter of Tṛṇabindu. There
<div n="lb"/>is a story about him in Uttara Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once the sage Pulastya was doing penance in a seclud-
<div n="lb"/>ed place in the Himālayas when a few Deva Gandharva
<div n="lb"/>women came to that place and disturbed his penance
<div n="lb"/>by their dances and noise. The angered sage gave a
<div n="lb"/>curse to that place saying that any woman coming to
<div n="lb"/>that place would become pregnant. Māninī, daughter
<div n="lb"/>of Tṛṇabindu went to this place unaware of the curse
<div n="lb"/>and got pregnant. She came weeping to her father and
<div n="lb"/>Tṛṇabindu immediately took his daughter to Pulastya
<div n="lb"/>and asked him to marry Māninī. Pulastya married
<div n="lb"/>Māninī and Viśravas was born to her.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he cursed Hanūmān.%} Once Hanūmān caught
<div n="lb"/>hold of a lion and elephant in fight and tied them
<div n="lb"/>each to a post on the two sides of the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Tṛṇabindu. When the sage stepped out from the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage, he was for a moment frightened by the sight
<div n="lb"/>of two mighty animals on the sides of his āśrama and
<div n="lb"/>knew by his divine powers that the perpetrator of that
<div n="lb"/>deed was Hanūmān and so he cursed him saying that
<div n="lb"/>he would lose all his divine powers forthwith.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān begged for relief and the sage said that he
<div n="lb"/>would regain his powers at the time of his going in
<div n="lb"/>search of Sītā when another member of his species
<div n="lb"/>would remind him of his lost divine powers. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>remained oblivious of his powers till the time when the
<div n="lb"/>monkeys were trying to leap to Laṅkā from the
<div n="lb"/>Mahendra mountain on the shores of Bhārata. Jāmba-
<div n="lb"/>vān, a mighty monkey chief called Hanūmān to his
<div n="lb"/>side and made him understand the great powers latent
<div n="lb"/>in him. From that moment onwards Hanūmān regained
<div n="lb"/>his lost powers and became his old self. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān).
