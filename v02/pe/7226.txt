ŚŪRASENA V¦. A king of the Somavaṃśa of Prati-
ṣṭhānapura. Śūrasena, who was childless, tried to propit-
iate the gods in many ways to obtain a son. In the end
he got a son in the form of a serpent. But to keep
it a secret, he performed the usual ceremonies connect-
ed with his son's Upanayana, marriage etc. in the
usual manner. At last by the mercy of Gautamīdevī
Śūrasena's son obtained human form. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, 111).
