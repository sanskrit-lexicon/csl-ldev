BAKA I¦. A demon. The Pāṇḍavas escaping from the
trap of Arakkilla (lac-house) through a secret tunnel
went to the village Ekacakrā on the banks of the
river Gaṅgā and stayed there in the house of a brahmin.
Baka was a demon who was terrorising the villagers
there. He used to come to the village freely and carry
away people for his food. Because of this nobody lived
in peace and so they all joined together and decided
to send one man daily with plenty of other eatables to
the demon in this cave. Days went by like that and
one day the turn came to the brahmin who was shelter-
ing the Pāṇḍavas. That brahmin had besides his wife
one son and a daughter. The problem arose as to who
should go to the demon. The father was willing but
the wife did not want him to go and vice versa. The
children began to cry and hearing the noise Kuntī,
mother of the Pāṇḍavas, went there to enquire and
learned the tragic story of the family. She immediately
went to Bhīma and acquainted him with the problem
before the brahmin. Bhīma at once volunteered to go
to the demon deciding to kill the man-eater and thus
putting an end to his depredations.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīma started on his journey to the demon carrying a
cartload of rice and curry. Deliberately Bhīma arrived
at the place of the demon very late. Baka rolled his
eyes in anger at the sight of the late-comer. But
Bhīma without heeding him sat in front of the demon
and started eating the rice and curry. Baka charged
at Bhīma with fury but Bhīma defended and a battle
ensued in which Baka was killed and he fell dead
like a mountain-head dropping down.
<F>*) Kirmīra, a demon, was the brother of Baka. (Śloka 23, Chapter 11, Araṇya Parva, M.B.).
{%f%} It is in the 10th Skandha of Bhāgavata that the story of this Baka occurs. But in the vernacular translation of the same the story is
not so clear. Hence the original in Sanskrit is quoted below:
<Poem>Sa vai Bako nāma mahānasuro bakarūpadhṛk
Āgatya sahasā Kṛṣṇam tīkṣṇatuṇḍo 'grasadbalī
Kṛṣṇam mahābakagrastaṃ dṛṣṭvā Rāmādayo 'rbhakāḥ
Babhūvurindriyāṇīva vinā prāṇaṃ vicetasaḥ.</Poem></F> (Chapters 157-
164, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
