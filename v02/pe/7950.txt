VĀKPĀRUṢYA¦ (Using harsh words). One of the
wrongs brought under the rule of chastisement in ancient
India. Without caring for the truth or falsity, a man

comes under this crime. In olden days kings issued
orders to fine anybody found guilty of this crime. Ordi-
narily the fine was 25 Paṇas. If the crime was committ-
ed against one who was below the level of the culprit
the fine to be paid was only half. If harsh words were
used against other women or people of a higher level
the fine was double. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 258).
