VĀKPĀRUṢYA¦ (Using harsh words). One of the
<div n="lb"/>wrongs brought under the rule of chastisement in ancient
<div n="lb"/>India. Without caring for the truth or falsity, a man
<div n="lb"/>praising another with a view to tease or offend him,
<div n="lb"/>is Vākpārusya. The teasing may be aimed at some-
<div n="lb"/>body with disabled members of the body or disabled
<div n="lb"/>organs of sense. Besides, using heart-rending words also
[Page822-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>comes under this crime. In olden days kings issued
<div n="lb"/>orders to fine anybody found guilty of this crime. Ordi-
<div n="lb"/>narily the fine was 25 Paṇas. If the crime was committ-
<div n="lb"/>ed against one who was below the level of the culprit
<div n="lb"/>the fine to be paid was only half. If harsh words were
<div n="lb"/>used against other women or people of a higher level
<div n="lb"/>the fine was double. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 258).
