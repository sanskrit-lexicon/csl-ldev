BHAVABHŪTI¦. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th
century A.D. His important works are the three dramas,
Mālatīmādhava, Mahāvīracarita and Uttararāma-
carita. Bhavabhūti was a brahmin of the Kaśyapa-
gotra. He was the son of one Nīlakaṇṭha and one Jātu-
karṇī. He was a great devotee of Śiva and he got his
name Bhavabhūti later because of this. His original
name was Nīlakaṇṭha. Bhavabhūti was born in Padma-
pura in the state of Vidarbha. But Bhavabhūti spent
most of his life in the palace of Yaśodharmā, king of
Kannauj.
<div n="NI"/>Bhavabhūti's first drama is believed to be Mahāvīra-
carita. There are seven acts in this. The theme is based
on the story of Śrī Rāma. But there are some variations
from the original Rāmāyaṇa in this drama. Bhava-
bhūti states that even at the time of the svayaṃvara of
Sītā, Rāvaṇa was a suitor. There is an opinion among
certain critics that Bhavabhūti did write only up to the
46th verse in the fourth act and the rest was written
by another poet named Subrahmaṇya.
<div n="NI"/>Mālatīmādhava is a drama of ten acts. It is a love-story
of Mālatī and Mādhava. Mālatī was the daughter of the
minister of Ujjayinī and Madhava was the son of the
minister of Vidarbha. It was while Mādhava was having
his education in Ujjayinī that he came to love Mālatī.
It was Kāmandakī who was a classmate of both the
ministers and who became a sannyāsinī later who pulls
the strings of this love story. The king of Ujjayinī wanted
Mālatī to marry Nandana, a friend of his. But Mālatī
did not love him. Yet afraid of getting the displeasure of
the King, Mālatī's father decided to give her in marriage
to Nandana. In despair Mādhava was about to commit
suicide when from the temple nearby Mādhava heard
an agonised weeping. He rushed to the site of the sound
and found to his bewilderment the gruesome sight of
Mālatī being dragged for sacrifice by a sorceress named
Kapālakuṇḍalā helped by her guru Aghoraghaṇṭa.
Mādhava killed Aghoraghaṇṭa and saved Mālatī.
Disappointed Kapālakuṇḍalā swore that she would
seek revenge on Mādhava and disappeared. Mālatī
went back to her palace. At this time Madayantikā,
sister of Nandana and Makaranda, a friend of Mādhava
became lovers. Once Madayantikā was attacked by a
tiger in a Śiva temple and Makaranda saved her from
[Page128-a+ 63]
the wild beast, and they became lovers thereafter. The
proposal to give Mālatī in marriage to Nandana was
still pending then. The marriage day was fixed and a
day before that by a clever ruse played by the keen-
witted Kāmandakī Mālatī and Mādhava eloped together.
Makaranda, friend of Mādhava, was disguised and dressed
in bridal robes and Nandana little suspecting the trick
played on him married the substitute. Before they went
to the bridal chamber for the night Nandana's sister
came to see her new sister-in-law and the moment she
put her eyes on her she understood who it was and that
night they also eloped. Thus poor Nandana was left
alone.
<div n="NI"/>Kapālakuṇḍalā by her sorcery separated Mālatī from
Mādhava but luckily Saudāminī a disciple of Kāman-
takī saved her from Kapālakuṇḍalā. Later Mālatī
married Mādhava with the permission of the King.
This is the story of Mālatī-Mādhava.
<div n="NI"/>Uttararāmacarita is a play of seven acts. The theme is
the story of Rāma after his return to Ayodhyā after the
exile. It begins with the renouncement of Sītā by Rāma
and ends with the vanishing of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>All these three dramas used to be enacted during the
festival of ‘Kālapriyanātha’ at Ujjayinī. The predomi-
nant emotion in Mahāvīracarita is ‘Vīra’, in Mālatī-
Mādhava, ‘Sṛṅgāra’ and in Uttararāmacarita ‘Karuṇa’.
In expressing and elaborating the emotion of ‘Karuṇa’
Bhavabhūti excels Kālidāsa. The one draw-back which
keeps him second to Kālidāsa is his lack of humour and
wit. The sanskrit poet Dhanapāla in his book’
‘Tilakamañjari’ speaks about Bhavabhūti thus:
<Poem>Spaṣṭabhāvarasā citraiḥ
Padanyāsaiḥ pravarttitā /
Nāṭakeṣu naṭastrīva
Bhāratī Bhavabhūtinā //</Poem>
