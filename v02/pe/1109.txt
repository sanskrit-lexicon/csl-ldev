BHAVABHŪTI¦. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. His important works are the three dramas,
<div n="lb"/>Mālatīmādhava, Mahāvīracarita and Uttararāma-
<div n="lb"/>carita. Bhavabhūti was a brahmin of the Kaśyapa-
<div n="lb"/>gotra. He was the son of one Nīlakaṇṭha and one Jātu-
<div n="lb"/>karṇī. He was a great devotee of Śiva and he got his
<div n="lb"/>name Bhavabhūti later because of this. His original
<div n="lb"/>name was Nīlakaṇṭha. Bhavabhūti was born in Padma-
<div n="lb"/>pura in the state of Vidarbha. But Bhavabhūti spent
<div n="lb"/>most of his life in the palace of Yaśodharmā, king of
<div n="lb"/>Kannauj.
<div n="NI"/>Bhavabhūti's first drama is believed to be Mahāvīra-
<div n="lb"/>carita. There are seven acts in this. The theme is based
<div n="lb"/>on the story of Śrī Rāma. But there are some variations
<div n="lb"/>from the original Rāmāyaṇa in this drama. Bhava-
<div n="lb"/>bhūti states that even at the time of the svayaṃvara of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā, Rāvaṇa was a suitor. There is an opinion among
<div n="lb"/>certain critics that Bhavabhūti did write only up to the
<div n="lb"/>46th verse in the fourth act and the rest was written
<div n="lb"/>by another poet named Subrahmaṇya.
<div n="NI"/>Mālatīmādhava is a drama of ten acts. It is a love-story
<div n="lb"/>of Mālatī and Mādhava. Mālatī was the daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>minister of Ujjayinī and Madhava was the son of the
<div n="lb"/>minister of Vidarbha. It was while Mādhava was having
<div n="lb"/>his education in Ujjayinī that he came to love Mālatī.
<div n="lb"/>It was Kāmandakī who was a classmate of both the
<div n="lb"/>ministers and who became a sannyāsinī later who pulls
<div n="lb"/>the strings of this love story. The king of Ujjayinī wanted
<div n="lb"/>Mālatī to marry Nandana, a friend of his. But Mālatī
<div n="lb"/>did not love him. Yet afraid of getting the displeasure of
<div n="lb"/>the King, Mālatī's father decided to give her in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to Nandana. In despair Mādhava was about to commit
<div n="lb"/>suicide when from the temple nearby Mādhava heard
<div n="lb"/>an agonised weeping. He rushed to the site of the sound
<div n="lb"/>and found to his bewilderment the gruesome sight of
<div n="lb"/>Mālatī being dragged for sacrifice by a sorceress named
<div n="lb"/>Kapālakuṇḍalā helped by her guru Aghoraghaṇṭa.
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava killed Aghoraghaṇṭa and saved Mālatī.
<div n="lb"/>Disappointed Kapālakuṇḍalā swore that she would
<div n="lb"/>seek revenge on Mādhava and disappeared. Mālatī
<div n="lb"/>went back to her palace. At this time Madayantikā,
<div n="lb"/>sister of Nandana and Makaranda, a friend of Mādhava
<div n="lb"/>became lovers. Once Madayantikā was attacked by a
<div n="lb"/>tiger in a Śiva temple and Makaranda saved her from
[Page128-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>the wild beast, and they became lovers thereafter. The
<div n="lb"/>proposal to give Mālatī in marriage to Nandana was
<div n="lb"/>still pending then. The marriage day was fixed and a
<div n="lb"/>day before that by a clever ruse played by the keen-
<div n="lb"/>witted Kāmandakī Mālatī and Mādhava eloped together.
<div n="lb"/>Makaranda, friend of Mādhava, was disguised and dressed
<div n="lb"/>in bridal robes and Nandana little suspecting the trick
<div n="lb"/>played on him married the substitute. Before they went
<div n="lb"/>to the bridal chamber for the night Nandana's sister
<div n="lb"/>came to see her new sister-in-law and the moment she
<div n="lb"/>put her eyes on her she understood who it was and that
<div n="lb"/>night they also eloped. Thus poor Nandana was left
<div n="lb"/>alone.
<div n="NI"/>Kapālakuṇḍalā by her sorcery separated Mālatī from
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava but luckily Saudāminī a disciple of Kāman-
<div n="lb"/>takī saved her from Kapālakuṇḍalā. Later Mālatī
<div n="lb"/>married Mādhava with the permission of the King.
<div n="lb"/>This is the story of Mālatī-Mādhava.
<div n="NI"/>Uttararāmacarita is a play of seven acts. The theme is
<div n="lb"/>the story of Rāma after his return to Ayodhyā after the
<div n="lb"/>exile. It begins with the renouncement of Sītā by Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and ends with the vanishing of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>All these three dramas used to be enacted during the
<div n="lb"/>festival of ‘Kālapriyanātha’ at Ujjayinī. The predomi-
<div n="lb"/>nant emotion in Mahāvīracarita is ‘Vīra’, in Mālatī-
<div n="lb"/>Mādhava, ‘Sṛṅgāra’ and in Uttararāmacarita ‘Karuṇa’.
<div n="lb"/>In expressing and elaborating the emotion of ‘Karuṇa’
<div n="lb"/>Bhavabhūti excels Kālidāsa. The one draw-back which
<div n="lb"/>keeps him second to Kālidāsa is his lack of humour and
<div n="lb"/>wit. The sanskrit poet Dhanapāla in his book’
<div n="lb"/>‘Tilakamañjari’ speaks about Bhavabhūti thus:
<Poem>Spaṣṭabhāvarasā citraiḥ
<div n="lb"/>Padanyāsaiḥ pravarttitā /
<div n="lb"/>Nāṭakeṣu naṭastrīva
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratī Bhavabhūtinā //</Poem>
