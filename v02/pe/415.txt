ARAYANNAM¦. The swan (Haṃsa).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A bird (Haṃsa) in Devaloka. The prefix
<div n="lb"/>‘ara’ denotes royalty, sublimity, greatness etc. Many
<div n="lb"/>purāṇas describe Arayannam as a bird of the Devas.
<div n="lb"/>Mānasasaras at the heights of the Himālayas is the
<div n="lb"/>permanent abode of these divine birds. They do not
<div n="lb"/>like the rainy season. So they come down to the earth
<div n="lb"/>when rain begins at the Mānasasaras, and go back to
<div n="lb"/>the Saras, when rain begins on the earth. This pheno-
<div n="lb"/>menon explains Ceruśśeri's (Malayalam poet) state-
<div n="lb"/>ment in his Kṛṣṇagāthā that ‘when rain set in haṃsas
<div n="lb"/>-Arayannams—began flying away’.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} Kaśyapa, the son of Brahmā, married the
<div n="lb"/>eight daughters of Dakṣa, Tāmrā being one of them.
<div n="lb"/>Tāmrā bore five daughters Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Śukī. Śyenī gave birth to the kite,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭrī, the Haṃsa and the Kokā and Śukī the
<div n="lb"/>Śukas (doves). Kokā or the Cakravākī bird is the sister
<div n="lb"/>of Haṃsa. This is how the Arayanna and the Cakra-
<div n="lb"/>vāka got Devatva (divinity). (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 14).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhīṣma and the Arayanna.%} Śiśupāla, before his death,
<div n="lb"/>blabbered a lot of unbecoming things about Bhīṣma,
<div n="lb"/>who was partial to his (Śiśupāla's) enemies. And, he rela-
<div n="lb"/>ted the story of an Arayanna to elaborate the stand taken
<div n="lb"/>by the aged Bhīṣma. An aged Haṃsa (Arayanna) which
<div n="lb"/>once dwelt on the sea-coast preached to all the other
<div n="lb"/>birds much about ethical actions. The birds felt great res-
<div n="lb"/>peet for the Arayanna. They flew across the sea in search
<div n="lb"/>of prey after entrusting their eggs to the Arayanna. The
<div n="lb"/>old Arayanna grew fat on those eggs. There was one
<div n="lb"/>intelligent bird among the lot, and when it looked for
<div n="lb"/>the eggs they were not to be found. That bird informed
<div n="lb"/>its colleagues about the treacherous conduct of the
<div n="lb"/>Arayanna. The birds organised themselves and attacked
<div n="lb"/>the Arayanna to death. Oh! Bhīṣma, the same will be
<div n="lb"/>your end also. (M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 41, Verses
<div n="lb"/>30-41).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Nala and Arayanna.%} While Nala, the prince of the
<div n="lb"/>Niṣadha kingdom was resting in a garden he saw an
<div n="lb"/>Arayanna in a tank there. Out of curious pleasure Nala
<div n="lb"/>caught it, but seeing its mental tremor he let it free.
<div n="lb"/>Out of gratitude for this generous act, the Arayanna
<div n="lb"/>played the role of the messenger for Nala to get as his
<div n="lb"/>wife Damayantī, the very beautiful daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>King of Vidarbha.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%How the Arayanna (Haṃsa) got the white colour.%} Once
<div n="lb"/>king Marutta was conducting the Māheśvara Satra
<div n="lb"/>(a yāga) and Devas like Indra came down to receive
<div n="lb"/>their share of the Havis (oblations in the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>fire). And, this was the time when Rāvaṇa with his
<div n="lb"/>attendants was on his triumphal tour. Hearing that the
<div n="lb"/>Devas were at the Āśrama of Marutta, Rāvaṇa also
<div n="lb"/>went there, and Indra and the other Devas, trembling
<div n="lb"/>with fear, assumed different disguises and hid them-
<div n="lb"/>selves away. Indra assumed the guise of the peacock,
<div n="lb"/>Yama of the crow, Kubera of the chameleon and
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa of the Arayanna. Thus beguiled Rāvaṇa went
<div n="lb"/>his own way. The Devas, who thus escaped blessed the
<div n="lb"/>family of those birds whose forms they assumed. Indra
<div n="lb"/>shaped the blue feathers of the peacock with mixed
<div n="lb"/>colours and eyes like his own. Moreover, he blessed
<div n="lb"/>them that they would never be affected with any
<div n="lb"/>disease, and that they would dance with their feathers
<div n="lb"/>spread when rain set in. Yamadharma blessed the
[Page047-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>crows that they would get the offerings made on earth
<div n="lb"/>by men to their departed ancestors. And Bhagavān
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa told the Rāja-Haṃsas: “I escaped the clutches
<div n="lb"/>of Rāvaṇa by assuming your shape and form. Therefore,
<div n="lb"/>be thee, who are now black and white, in future as
<div n="lb"/>purely white as milk”. Kubera blessed the Chameleon
<div n="lb"/>with capacity to change colour as and how it pleased,
<div n="lb"/>and also for its cheeks to appear golden in colour to the
<div n="lb"/>onlookers. After thus blessing the birds the Devas dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
