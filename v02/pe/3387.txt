KĀŚMĪRAMAṆḌALAM¦. A particular place in Kaśmīra
where once a conference of sages was held. (Vana
Parva, Chapter 203). Besides all the prominent sages
of North India, distinguished persons like Nahuṣa,
Yayāti, Asi and Kaśyapa attended the conference.
Rivers Jhelam and Chenab flow through this place, and
it is a holy centre. Those who bathe here will become
like sages.
