MARAṆA¦ (M) (DEATH). Death is a goddess whose
name is Mṛtyu. The Purāṇas state that there was no
death in the world before the birth of this goddess. In
Mahābhārata, Droṇa Parva, Chapter 53 there is the
following story about the circumstances in which
Brahmā created Mṛtyu.
<div n="NI"/>Living beings multiplied endlessly on earth. As they
had no death, the goddess Earth found their weight too
much for her to bear. She went weeping to Brahmā and
prayed for his help. At that time, Rudra and Nārada
were present in Brahmā's assembly. Brahmā said that
he did not like destroying living beings. Because of
the pressure of Rudra and Nārada, Brahmā created out
of Viśvaprakāsa (Cosmic Light) a woman. She
was born from the south and Brahmā gave her the
[Page486-b+ 65]
name “Mṛtyu”. He gave her permission to destroy
human beings.
<div n="NI"/>When she heard that she was to kill living beings, she shed
tears and Brahmā gathered those tears. She went to
Dhenukāśrama and other places and performed tapas. At
last Brahmā called her back and assured her that it was
not against Dharma to kill living beings. He changed
the tears he had gathered from her face into the various
diseases and returned them to her. He gave those dis-
eases and the god Yama as her companions. Thus the
goddess Mṛtyu started her dance of destruction. (See
also under the word PUNARJANMA).
