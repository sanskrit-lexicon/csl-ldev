SUKṚṢA¦. A liberal hermit. A story about this hermit
<div n="lb"/>occurs in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once Indra wanted to test Sukṛṣa. So he came in the
<div n="lb"/>guise of a bird and requested for human flesh. Then
<div n="lb"/>the hermit called his sons and asked them to give their
<div n="lb"/>flesh to the bird. They were not prepared to do so.
<div n="lb"/>Sukṛṣa got angry and cursed his sons that they would
<div n="lb"/>be born as birds. Accordingly the sons of the hermit
<div n="lb"/>took birth in the Garuḍa family under the names
<div n="lb"/>Droṇaputra, Piṅgākṣa, Vibodha, Suputra and Sumukha.
<div n="lb"/>As a remission of the curse, the hermit said that even
<div n="lb"/>as birds they would be having wisdom and knowledge.
<div n="NI"/>After this, to keep his word, Sukṛṣa got ready to cut
<div n="lb"/>his own flesh for the bird. Then Indra appeared in his
<div n="lb"/>own form and blessed the hermit.
