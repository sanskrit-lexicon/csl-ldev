SUKṚṢA¦. A liberal hermit. A story about this hermit
occurs in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once Indra wanted to test Sukṛṣa. So he came in the
guise of a bird and requested for human flesh. Then
the hermit called his sons and asked them to give their
flesh to the bird. They were not prepared to do so.
Sukṛṣa got angry and cursed his sons that they would
be born as birds. Accordingly the sons of the hermit
took birth in the Garuḍa family under the names
Droṇaputra, Piṅgākṣa, Vibodha, Suputra and Sumukha.
As a remission of the curse, the hermit said that even
as birds they would be having wisdom and knowledge.
<div n="NI"/>After this, to keep his word, Sukṛṣa got ready to cut
his own flesh for the bird. Then Indra appeared in his
own form and blessed the hermit.
