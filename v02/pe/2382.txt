GAUTAMA IV¦. Another ascetic of great virtue. Once
<div n="lb"/>when this Gautama was going through the forest he
<div n="lb"/>saw an elephant babe lying wearied. He took it to his
<div n="lb"/>āśrama and brought it up. When it became a full
<div n="lb"/>grown elephant Indra disguised as the emperor
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra came to take it away secretly. Gautama
<div n="lb"/>found it out and then he was offered thousand cows
<div n="lb"/>and much wealth in lieu of the elephant. But Gautama
<div n="lb"/>refused to part with the elephant. Pleased with his
<div n="lb"/>extreme affection for his dependant, Indra took both
<div n="lb"/>Gautama and the elephant to heaven. (Chapter 102,
<div n="lb"/>Anuśāsana Parva).
