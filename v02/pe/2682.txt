HIRAṆYA¦. (Hiraṇyakaśipu, Hiraṇyākṣa)
[Page314-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Owing to a curse Jaya and Vijaya who were
gate-keepers at Vaikuṇṭha were born as two asuras,
Hiraṇyākṣa (elder brother) and Hiraṇyakaśipu (youn-
ger brother). These brothers are known also as the
Hiraṇyas. (See Jayavijayas).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Three sons called Hiraṇyākṣa, Hiraṇyakaśipu
and Vajrāṅga and a daughter, Siṃhikā were born to
Kaśyapaprajāpati by his wife Diti. To Hiraṇyakaśipu
were born four sons called Anuhlāda, Hlāda Prahlāda
and Saṃhlāda. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>There is yet another story relating to the birth of these
asuras. Though the other wives of Kaśyapa became
mothers Diti alone was not blessed with a child for a
long time. One day at dusk while Kaśyapa was immers-
ed in meditation Diti rushed into his room and began
lamenting and complaining about her having not yet
been made a mother, and urgently asked Kaśyapa to
make her one. But, Kaśyapa pointed out that it was
not the proper time for such things. It was dusk when
Śiva with his attendants would be out sight-seeing
covered with ashes from burning ghats spread all around
by storms. So Kaśyapa wanted to wait for some time
more. But, she was not in a mood to pay heed to his
advice and Kaśyapa had to yield to her proposal. After
obliging her, once again he took his bath and began
meditation.
<div n="NI"/>Diti became pregnant. She also got alarmed about the
indiscretion committed at dusk time that day and,
Kaśyapa told her: “Your mind became impure, you
did not obey me, you insulted the Devas also. There
are two kids of a very low type in your womb. They
will oppress the three worlds and kill innocent people.
Mahāviṣṇu will never tolerate such things. He will
incarnate himself to kill them. But since you feel peni-
tent now, a grand-son of yours will become liked by all
good people, and he will be a great devotee of Mahā-
viṣṇu. (This was Prahlāda).
<div n="NI"/>At any rate, one hundred years after her getting preg-
nant Diti delivered twin sons. The first born was named
Hiraṇyākṣa and the next one Hiraṇyakaśipu. (Accor-
ding to certain Purāṇas Hiraṇyakaśipu was the first
born).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Hiraṇyākṣa.%} The boys grew up to become a growing
menace to the whole world. Hiraṇyākṣa toured all the
three worlds with a club. He besieged svarga. Devas ran
away in fear. Hiraṇyākṣa, shaking his club, jumped
from the sky into the sea and engaged himself in the
sport of thrashing the waves with his club. Years passed
by like this, and at last he went to Vibhāvarī, the capi-
tal of Varuṇa and challenged him to fight. Varuṇa
came out of the palace, admitted his incapacity to fight
Hiraṇyākṣa, and suggested to him to challenge Mahā-
viṣṇu. Accordingly he set out in search of Mahāviṣṇu.
It was during this period of time that the earth got engulf-
ed in water. Svāyambhuvamanu requested his father,
Brahmā to raise up the earth from water. But, nowhere
could be seen the earth, everywhere it was only a vast
expanse of water. Brahmā then meditated upon Mahā
viṣṇu, who came out through Brahmā's nose in the form
of a tiny boar. It grew up into a very big boar within
no time, and jumped from the sky into the ocean, and
within a few minutes it picked up from under the
ocean the earth on its tusks and appeared on the surface
of the water. Hiraṇyākṣa understood that the boar,
which without the least fear picked up the earth from
[Page314-b+ 65]
Pātāla was none other than Mahāvisṇu and he chal-
lenged Viṣṇu to fight. After replacing the earth in its
old position Viṣṇu fought with Hiraṇyākṣa and killed
him.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Hiraṇyakaśipu.%} With the killing of his brother,
Hiraṇyakaśipu's hatred and enmity towards Viṣṇu in-
creased very much. He, by doing tapas for very long
years, secured boons from Brahmā and conquered the
three worlds and ruled them as Triloka Cakravarti
(Emperor of the three worlds). He prohibited through-
out the empire not only the chanting of Viṣṇu's name,
but even thinking about him (Viṣṇu) by his subjects.
“Hiraṇyāya namaḥ” (salutations to Hiraṇya) replaced
the old custom of chanting ‘Nārāyaṇāya namaḥ’ (salu-
tations to Nārāyaṇa). Meantime, a son called Prahlāda,
a great devotee of Mahāviṣṇu was born to Hiraṇya-
kaśipu. (For the story of Hiraṇyakaśipu's death see
Prahlāda). (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa; Padma
Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapter 20).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Story about the name Hiraṇyakaśipu.%} Sage Kaśyapa
once conducted an Aśvamedha yajña. A golden seat
was put up there for the great sages who came to parti-
cipate in the yajña. Diti was pregnant during the time
of the yajña, and while it was duly progressing she one
day came and sat on the above-mentioned golden seat,
and very shortly she delivered a child. As the child was
delivered on the golden seat the child came to be called
Hiraṇyakaśipu. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, 8, 5, 7-12; Vāyu
Purāṇa 67, 69).
