DHANURVEDA¦.
<div n="NI"/>{%General information.%} A scientific treatise on the art of
warfare in ancient Bhārata. Because of the undue im-
portance of the science the treatise is deemed and respect-
ed as a Veda. There have been innumerable books on the
subject to teach Dhanurveda to the Kṣatriya youths.
In the book ‘Prasthānabheda’ by Madhusūdana Saras-
vatī he states that Dhanurveda is a branch of Yajurveda.
A Sanskrit book called Dhanurvedasaṃhitā is now
available. Some scholars are of opinion that not much
antiquity can be attributed to this work. Many books
relating to Dhanurveda have been lost to us. What
details are there in Agni Purāṇa are given below:
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Divisions of Dhanurveda.%} This is known as Catuṣpāda
(four-footed) also because of the fact that the four
main constituents of an army are the chariots, elephants,
horses and men. Dhanurveda has been divided into
five parts (1) Yantramukta, (2) Pāṇimukta, (3) Mukta-
sandhārita, (4) Amukta and (5) Bāhuyuddha. There is
another division according to Astra and Śastra. There
is yet another division of the science into two by some
scholars from a different viewpoint calling them Māyā
and Ṛju.
<div n="NI"/>{%Yantramukta%} (Yantra = machine). This means a war-
fare where machines are used. Kṣepiṇī (sling) bow and
arrow and other such machines are included in this.
<div n="NI"/>{%Pāṇimukta.%} (Pāṇi = hand). This is where the hand is used
mainly. Stone, mace etc. are used in this.
<div n="NI"/>{%Muktasandhārita.%} This includes the use of weapons like
a spear.
<div n="NI"/>{%Amukta.%} The use of a weapon like a sword which never
leaves your hand.
<div n="NI"/>{%Bāhuyuddha.%} (Bāhu = head). The fight with only bare
hands without the use of a weapon. One who wishes
to fight should make ready his own weapons. He should
be one who will never get tired even after exertion. A
war with bows and arrows is considered the best and
[Page222-a+ 65]
most manly, that with a spear ranks next, a fight with a
sword is bad and a fight with hands, the most mean.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Trainees.%} Only a brahmin is entitled to be a pre-
ceptor in Dhanurveda. The Kṣatriya and Vaiśya should
learn from him. The Śūdra can fight of his own in
danger. He is not allowed to learn military science
from a preceptor. Those mixed-born are to help the
king during a war.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Various postures.%} There are nine different ways of
standing when you give a fight, classified according to
the different positions of one's foot, heel and knee.
<div n="NI"/>{%Samapāda.%} When you stand with your Aṅguṣṭha, Nari-
yāṇi (Gulpha), Pāṇi and Pāda closely joined together,
it is termed Samapāda.
<div n="NI"/>{%Vaiśākha.%} Keep your legs twentyseven inches apart and
without bending your knees stand erect throwing your
weight on the fingers of the foot. This stand is called
Vaiśākha.
<div n="NI"/>{%Maṇḍala.%} Keep your knees thirtysix inches apart and
stand in the shape of a haṃsapaṅkti and this position
is called Maṇḍala.
<div n="NI"/>{%Ālīḍha.%} Bend your right knee and thigh in the shape of a
plough and without any movement to that posture
draw your left leg fortyfive inches apart. This stand is
called Ālīḍha.
<div n="NI"/>{%Pratyālīḍha.%} If you bend your left knee and thigh and
stand like above it is called Pratyālīḍha.
<div n="NI"/>{%Jāta.%} Place your right foot straight and place the left one
perpendicular to the right one with the heels and the
ankles of the feet five fingers apart. The whole length
of the posture should not exceed twelve fingers. This
stand is called Jāta.
<div n="NI"/>{%Daṇḍayāta.%} Keep the right knee bent and the left leg
straight or vice versa. This posture is called Daṇḍāyata.
<div n="NI"/>{%Vikaṭa.%} If for the above posture the distance between
the two legs is two palm-length it is Vikaṭa.
<div n="NI"/>{%Svapuṭa.%} Keep the knees viguṇas and the feet Uttāyanas
for the posture of Svapuṭa.
<div n="NI"/>{%Śvastika.%} Keep your legs sixteen fingers apart and raise
your feet a little keeping the level of both the feet equal.
This is Svastika.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Use of arrows.%} Before a man is to make use of a bow
and arrow he should first take the posture of Svastika
and bow down. He should take the bow by the left hand,
take the arrow by the right hand. He then should adopt
a posture of either Vaiśākha or Jāta and taking the bow
should sink into the earth one end of the bow and
draw the bow-string up to the other end and see whe-
ther there is sufficient length for the string. He should
take an arrow from his sheath and thrust the arrow-
head into the ground near the bow. He should
place his elbow on the top of the arrow with his forearm
bent and fist clenched. If the clenched fist touches the
top of the bow that bow and arrow is superior to any
other. He should tie the bow-string in a way that the
distance between the tied bow-string and the bow is
twelve fingers. He should place the bow in front of his
navel and the arrows in a quiver on his hip. Taking an
arrow he should raise the bow and fix the arrow at a
point on the bow-tring between his eye and ear. He
should take the arrow by his left fist and fix it so that the
fist touches the left nipple. The bow should not change
position horizontally, vertically, laterally, face down-
wards or upwards. Then taking an arrow from the sheath
by the thumb and forefinger fix it on the bow-string and
[Page222-b+ 65]
stretch it well before sending the shot. The clue to
correct aim is this. Anything that one can see with one's
eyes but can be covered by his fist is within the arrow-
shot. When one arrow is sent another should be taken
immediately from the sheath and sent in quick succes-
sion. This is called Upaccheda.
