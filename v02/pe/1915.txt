DHANURVEDA¦.
<div n="NI"/>{%General information.%} A scientific treatise on the art of
<div n="lb"/>warfare in ancient Bhārata. Because of the undue im-
<div n="lb"/>portance of the science the treatise is deemed and respect-
<div n="lb"/>ed as a Veda. There have been innumerable books on the
<div n="lb"/>subject to teach Dhanurveda to the Kṣatriya youths.
<div n="lb"/>In the book ‘Prasthānabheda’ by Madhusūdana Saras-
<div n="lb"/>vatī he states that Dhanurveda is a branch of Yajurveda.
<div n="lb"/>A Sanskrit book called Dhanurvedasaṃhitā is now
<div n="lb"/>available. Some scholars are of opinion that not much
<div n="lb"/>antiquity can be attributed to this work. Many books
<div n="lb"/>relating to Dhanurveda have been lost to us. What
<div n="lb"/>details are there in Agni Purāṇa are given below:
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Divisions of Dhanurveda.%} This is known as Catuṣpāda
<div n="lb"/>(four-footed) also because of the fact that the four
<div n="lb"/>main constituents of an army are the chariots, elephants,
<div n="lb"/>horses and men. Dhanurveda has been divided into
<div n="lb"/>five parts (1) Yantramukta, (2) Pāṇimukta, (3) Mukta-
<div n="lb"/>sandhārita, (4) Amukta and (5) Bāhuyuddha. There is
<div n="lb"/>another division according to Astra and Śastra. There
<div n="lb"/>is yet another division of the science into two by some
<div n="lb"/>scholars from a different viewpoint calling them Māyā
<div n="lb"/>and Ṛju.
<div n="NI"/>{%Yantramukta%} (Yantra = machine). This means a war-
<div n="lb"/>fare where machines are used. Kṣepiṇī (sling) bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrow and other such machines are included in this.
<div n="NI"/>{%Pāṇimukta.%} (Pāṇi = hand). This is where the hand is used
<div n="lb"/>mainly. Stone, mace etc. are used in this.
<div n="NI"/>{%Muktasandhārita.%} This includes the use of weapons like
<div n="lb"/>a spear.
<div n="NI"/>{%Amukta.%} The use of a weapon like a sword which never
<div n="lb"/>leaves your hand.
<div n="NI"/>{%Bāhuyuddha.%} (Bāhu = head). The fight with only bare
<div n="lb"/>hands without the use of a weapon. One who wishes
<div n="lb"/>to fight should make ready his own weapons. He should
<div n="lb"/>be one who will never get tired even after exertion. A
<div n="lb"/>war with bows and arrows is considered the best and
[Page222-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>most manly, that with a spear ranks next, a fight with a
<div n="lb"/>sword is bad and a fight with hands, the most mean.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Trainees.%} Only a brahmin is entitled to be a pre-
<div n="lb"/>ceptor in Dhanurveda. The Kṣatriya and Vaiśya should
<div n="lb"/>learn from him. The Śūdra can fight of his own in
<div n="lb"/>danger. He is not allowed to learn military science
<div n="lb"/>from a preceptor. Those mixed-born are to help the
<div n="lb"/>king during a war.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Various postures.%} There are nine different ways of
<div n="lb"/>standing when you give a fight, classified according to
<div n="lb"/>the different positions of one's foot, heel and knee.
<div n="NI"/>{%Samapāda.%} When you stand with your Aṅguṣṭha, Nari-
<div n="lb"/>yāṇi (Gulpha), Pāṇi and Pāda closely joined together,
<div n="lb"/>it is termed Samapāda.
<div n="NI"/>{%Vaiśākha.%} Keep your legs twentyseven inches apart and
<div n="lb"/>without bending your knees stand erect throwing your
<div n="lb"/>weight on the fingers of the foot. This stand is called
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśākha.
<div n="NI"/>{%Maṇḍala.%} Keep your knees thirtysix inches apart and
<div n="lb"/>stand in the shape of a haṃsapaṅkti and this position
<div n="lb"/>is called Maṇḍala.
<div n="NI"/>{%Ālīḍha.%} Bend your right knee and thigh in the shape of a
<div n="lb"/>plough and without any movement to that posture
<div n="lb"/>draw your left leg fortyfive inches apart. This stand is
<div n="lb"/>called Ālīḍha.
<div n="NI"/>{%Pratyālīḍha.%} If you bend your left knee and thigh and
<div n="lb"/>stand like above it is called Pratyālīḍha.
<div n="NI"/>{%Jāta.%} Place your right foot straight and place the left one
<div n="lb"/>perpendicular to the right one with the heels and the
<div n="lb"/>ankles of the feet five fingers apart. The whole length
<div n="lb"/>of the posture should not exceed twelve fingers. This
<div n="lb"/>stand is called Jāta.
<div n="NI"/>{%Daṇḍayāta.%} Keep the right knee bent and the left leg
<div n="lb"/>straight or vice versa. This posture is called Daṇḍāyata.
<div n="NI"/>{%Vikaṭa.%} If for the above posture the distance between
<div n="lb"/>the two legs is two palm-length it is Vikaṭa.
<div n="NI"/>{%Svapuṭa.%} Keep the knees viguṇas and the feet Uttāyanas
<div n="lb"/>for the posture of Svapuṭa.
<div n="NI"/>{%Śvastika.%} Keep your legs sixteen fingers apart and raise
<div n="lb"/>your feet a little keeping the level of both the feet equal.
<div n="lb"/>This is Svastika.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Use of arrows.%} Before a man is to make use of a bow
<div n="lb"/>and arrow he should first take the posture of Svastika
<div n="lb"/>and bow down. He should take the bow by the left hand,
<div n="lb"/>take the arrow by the right hand. He then should adopt
<div n="lb"/>a posture of either Vaiśākha or Jāta and taking the bow
<div n="lb"/>should sink into the earth one end of the bow and
<div n="lb"/>draw the bow-string up to the other end and see whe-
<div n="lb"/>ther there is sufficient length for the string. He should
<div n="lb"/>take an arrow from his sheath and thrust the arrow-
<div n="lb"/>head into the ground near the bow. He should
<div n="lb"/>place his elbow on the top of the arrow with his forearm
<div n="lb"/>bent and fist clenched. If the clenched fist touches the
<div n="lb"/>top of the bow that bow and arrow is superior to any
<div n="lb"/>other. He should tie the bow-string in a way that the
<div n="lb"/>distance between the tied bow-string and the bow is
<div n="lb"/>twelve fingers. He should place the bow in front of his
<div n="lb"/>navel and the arrows in a quiver on his hip. Taking an
<div n="lb"/>arrow he should raise the bow and fix the arrow at a
<div n="lb"/>point on the bow-tring between his eye and ear. He
<div n="lb"/>should take the arrow by his left fist and fix it so that the
<div n="lb"/>fist touches the left nipple. The bow should not change
<div n="lb"/>position horizontally, vertically, laterally, face down-
<div n="lb"/>wards or upwards. Then taking an arrow from the sheath
<div n="lb"/>by the thumb and forefinger fix it on the bow-string and
[Page222-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>stretch it well before sending the shot. The clue to
<div n="lb"/>correct aim is this. Anything that one can see with one's
<div n="lb"/>eyes but can be covered by his fist is within the arrow-
<div n="lb"/>shot. When one arrow is sent another should be taken
<div n="lb"/>immediately from the sheath and sent in quick succes-
<div n="lb"/>sion. This is called Upaccheda.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Operations with a sword and a carma (shield).%} There
<div n="lb"/>are thirtytwo different ways of putting into use a sword
