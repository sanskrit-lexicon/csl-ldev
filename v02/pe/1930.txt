DHARĀPĀLA¦. A king of ancient times. He ruled over
<div n="lb"/>a country named Vidiśā. There is a holy place where
<div n="lb"/>the rivers Vetasī and Vetravatī meet. Dharāpāla cons-
<div n="lb"/>tructed a temple at the confluence. There is a story also
<div n="lb"/>for his doing so.
<div n="NI"/>Once a Śiva-pārṣada brought to Śiva a woman at a time
<div n="lb"/>when Pārvatī was away from the place. Śiva and the
<div n="lb"/>woman were enjoying each other when Pārvatī came
<div n="lb"/>to the place. Getting angry she cursed the Pārṣada and
<div n="lb"/>made him into a fox. The fox came to the place where
<div n="lb"/>the rivers Vetasī and Vetravatī meet and did penance
<div n="lb"/>there and attained Mokṣa. Dharāpāla saw the divine
<div n="lb"/>plane coming down to take the Pārṣada away and he,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, constructed a temple at the place where the
<div n="lb"/>plane landed. He then arranged scholars well versed
<div n="lb"/>in Vedas and śāstras to read Padma Purāṇa there. He
<div n="lb"/>himself read Padma Purāṇa and attained mokṣa.
