DHARĀPĀLA¦. A king of ancient times. He ruled over
a country named Vidiśā. There is a holy place where
the rivers Vetasī and Vetravatī meet. Dharāpāla cons-
tructed a temple at the confluence. There is a story also
for his doing so.
<div n="NI"/>Once a Śiva-pārṣada brought to Śiva a woman at a time
when Pārvatī was away from the place. Śiva and the
woman were enjoying each other when Pārvatī came
to the place. Getting angry she cursed the Pārṣada and
made him into a fox. The fox came to the place where
the rivers Vetasī and Vetravatī meet and did penance
there and attained Mokṣa. Dharāpāla saw the divine
plane coming down to take the Pārṣada away and he,
therefore, constructed a temple at the place where the
plane landed. He then arranged scholars well versed
in Vedas and śāstras to read Padma Purāṇa there. He
himself read Padma Purāṇa and attained mokṣa.
(Chapter 29, Padma Purāṇa).
