KURAṄṄU¦. (The Malayālam word for monkey).
Kaśyapa, the grandson of Brahmā and son of Marīci
married eight daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati and one
of them Krodhavaśā delivered ten daughters. Monkeys
and lions were born from Harī, one of those ten
daughters. Thus they are brothers, and both are
called ‘hari’. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa,
Canto 14, Verse 24).
