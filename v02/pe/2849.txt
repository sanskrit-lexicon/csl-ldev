JAMBUKA¦. (JAMBUMĀLIKA). A Śūdra Sage. The
child of a brahmin died when Śrī Rāma, after his twelve
years’ exile in forest had returned to Ayodhyā and was
ruling the country in an ideal manner. The brahmin
and his wife carried the dead body of their child to the
palace with loud lamentations. Everybody felt surprised
how there could be child-death in the land when the
King was ruling it in the most dhārmic (righteous)
manner. Then did Nārada, who was present in the
assembly, point out that in a corner of Rāmarājya a
Śūdra Sage was doing tapas and that it was the reason
for the untimely death of the brahmin child. At once
Śrī Rāma set out in search of the Śūdra Sage after
directing Śatrughna to see that no enemy entered the
country, and asking Lakṣmaṇa to take care of the dead
body of the brahmin child. After a rather detailed
search Śrī Rāma found Jambuka at the mountain called
Śailam doing tapas hanging from the branch of a tree
on his legs with head down. He told Śrī Rāma that he
was the Śūdra Sage called Jambuka and was performing
tapas thus so that he might ascend to heaven in his very
body. Śrī Rāma at once cut off the head of the Śūdra
Sage, who attained, as soon as Rāma's sword fell on him,
mokṣa (salvation), and the dead child of the brahmin
returned to life again. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
