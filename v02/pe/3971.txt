LAṄKĀ¦. The kingdom of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} It is believed that the present island of
<div n="lb"/>Ceylon was the Laṅkā of the Purāṇas, the city of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa. This city of Laṅkā was situated on the top of
<div n="lb"/>the mountain Trikūṭa. This Trikūṭa was a peak
<div n="lb"/>of Mahāmeru. Because of a fight between Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>and Vāyubhagavān this peak broke away from
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmeru and fell into the ocean. (See Para 5 under
<div n="lb"/>Kubera).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%History.%} Viśvakarmā constructed a magnificent city
<div n="lb"/>on the top of the mountain Trikūṭa for the use of
<div n="lb"/>Kubera. Kubera lived there adored and worshipped by
<div n="lb"/>all. One day Kubera travelled by air in an aeroplane of
<div n="lb"/>his. Kaikasī, mother of Rāvaṇa saw that and she became
<div n="lb"/>jealous. She called her son to her side and said that
<div n="lb"/>at any cost the city of Laṅkā on the mount Trikūṭa
<div n="lb"/>should be captured and given to her. Rāvaṇa along
<div n="lb"/>with his brothers went to the Himālayas and performed
<div n="lb"/>penance there and obtained several boons from Śiva. Then
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa conducted a victory march as an arch-opponen
[Page451-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>of all living forces and drove away Kubera from Laṅkā
<div n="lb"/>and took possession of Laṅkā as the place of his abode.
<div n="lb"/>He took along with him all the demons residing in
<div n="lb"/>Pātālaloka.
<div n="NI"/>3). {%The design of Laṅkā.%} Viśvakarmā, the celebrated
<div n="lb"/>architect designed the beautiful Laṅkā and the supreme
<div n="lb"/>building ability of Maya brought into form the enchant-
<div n="lb"/>ing city. On the top of Trikūṭa was the all important
<div n="lb"/>Navaratnaśṛṅga and on a spacious plateau on its top
<div n="lb"/>stood the majestic city of Laṅkā. In the centre was the
<div n="lb"/>ten-storeyed palace of Rāvaṇa and around it in eight
<div n="lb"/>different places stood the nine-storeyed buildings of the
<div n="lb"/>great ministers of Rāvaṇa. The nine edifices were like
<div n="lb"/>the Navagrahas (nine planets) of Laṅkā. Each of the nine
<div n="lb"/>edifices was built with one of the nine gems and the royal
<div n="lb"/>palace in the centre was built by using all the nine gems.
<div n="lb"/>Even the sun avoided passing over these buildings and
<div n="lb"/>changed his path either a bit to the north or to the
<div n="lb"/>south making what is known as the Dakṣiṇāyana and
<div n="lb"/>Uttarāyaṇa. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%No sand in Laṅkā.%} The ancient belief is that there is
<div n="lb"/>no sand in Laṅkā The fourth taraṅga of Kathāmukha-
<div n="lb"/>lambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara gives a story relating to the
<div n="lb"/>reason for this belief.
<div n="NI"/>Garuḍa flew to Devaloka to bring Amṛta (nectar) to
<div n="lb"/>redeem his mother from her servitude to his step-mother.
<div n="lb"/>On his way he took an elephant and tortoise from near
<div n="lb"/>the āśrama of Kaśyapa for his food. He sat on a huge
<div n="lb"/>banyan tree to eat them. On the ground below the
<div n="lb"/>Bālakhilyas were performing penance. The branch on
<div n="lb"/>which Garuḍa sat with his food sagged and before it
<div n="lb"/>broke Garuḍa took away the elephant and tortoise
<div n="lb"/>and deposited them on the mountain Gandhamādana
<div n="lb"/>near the ocean. The branch broke and fell into the ocean
<div n="lb"/>and the city of Laṅkā was built on the branch and that
<div n="lb"/>was why the ancient people believed there was no sand
<div n="lb"/>in Laṅkā.
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Other details.%}
