AŚVAMEDHA II¦. A yāga. Kings used to conduct this
in order to get absolved of all sins. Fixing a victory
card on the head of a horse it is allowed to roam about
freely. If anybody stops the horse and ties it, the King
should go and defeat him in battle and bring back the
horse. If you do a hundred such yāgas you can become
Indra.

about should go into all countries. Those who opposed the sovereignty of the King could stop the horse and tie it. Then the King had

to fight those who opposed the King. Indra had conducted a hundred such yāgas.</F>
