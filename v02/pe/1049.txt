BHARADVĀJA II¦. The sage Bharadvāja of Purāṇic
<div n="lb"/>fame.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of Kampa
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa states that this sage was the son of Atri
<div n="lb"/>Maharṣi. He lived for many thousands of years. He is
<div n="lb"/>connected with Vālmīki and the story of Śrī Rāma.
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja was for many years a disciple of Vālmīki.
<div n="lb"/>He was present with Vālmīki when the hunter killed
<div n="lb"/>one of the couple of Krauñca. When Vālmīki and
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja reached the shores of the river, Tamasā,
<div n="lb"/>that day Vālmīki told Bharadvāja thus: “Look, Bhara-
<div n="lb"/>dvāja, what a clean ghat this is. The water is pure and
<div n="lb"/>clear. Place your water-jug here and give me my
<div n="lb"/>valkala. We will get down here in this sacred water”.
<div n="lb"/>Then Vālmīki taking the valkala from the disciple
<div n="lb"/>walked along the shore admiring the beauty of the
<div n="lb"/>forest trees and found on his way the historic Krauñca
<div n="lb"/>couple. (Sarga 2, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Bharadvāja and the study of Vedas.%} Bharadvāja gave
<div n="lb"/>himself untiringly to the study of the Vedas. He obtain-
<div n="lb"/>ed from Indra a boon to extend his term of life on
<div n="lb"/>earth to many thousands of years by different stages,
<div n="lb"/>each stage covering a span of a thousand years of life.
<div n="lb"/>All these years he devoted to an incessant study of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas. Finding the term not sufficient for completing
<div n="lb"/>the study of the Vedas he appealed to Indra again for
<div n="lb"/>extension and Indra appearing in person took him before
<div n="lb"/>three mountains and giving him three handfuls of
<div n="lb"/>sand told him thus, “What you have studied about
<div n="lb"/>Vedas till this time is equivalent to the amount of
<div n="lb"/>sand I have now given and what is yet to be studied
<div n="lb"/>about the Vedas is as big as the three mountains before
<div n="lb"/>you”. Any other mortal being would have been dis-
<div n="lb"/>heartened by this revelation made by Indra, but not
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja. Undaunted he continued his studies. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bharadvāja in the role of a magician.%} The āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja was in Citrakūṭa and Śrī Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa in the beginning of their exile went to his
<div n="lb"/>āśrama accepting his blessings. Bharata on his return
<div n="lb"/>from Kekaya knew about the exile of his brothers and
<div n="lb"/>hoping to bring them back to Ayodhyā went in search
<div n="lb"/>of them with a big retinue of soldiers and men. Keeping
<div n="lb"/>the retinue outside, Bharata went to the āśrama of
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja. The latter decided to give Bharata and his
<div n="lb"/>people a grand reception and calling Viśvakarmā to his
<div n="lb"/>side asked him to arrange a royal banquet that night.
<div n="lb"/>Devas, Gandharvas, Apsarases, Aṣṭadikpālas and all
<div n="lb"/>such people were invited for the night. Renowned dancers
<div n="lb"/>from devaloka like Ghṛtācī, Hemā, Viśvācī Miśrakeśī and
<div n="lb"/>Alambuṣā appeared for entertainment. Even Vanarājī
<div n="lb"/>took part in the dance. Dishes of food came to the
<div n="lb"/>guests of their own accord. The night came to an end
<div n="lb"/>wonderfully and at daybreak everything vanished and
<div n="lb"/>all were amazed at the magic of the sage. (Sarga 91,
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Droṇa's origin.%} Droṇa was the son born to Bhara-
<div n="lb"/>dvāja of the celestial woman, Ghṛtācī. (see under
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%How Bharadvāja died once but was born again.%} See under
<div n="lb"/>Arvāvasu.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The name Bharadvāja.%} This is how the connotation of
<div n="lb"/>the word is explained.
