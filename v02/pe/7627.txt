TUMBURU I¦. A Deva Gandharva. He was the best
musician among the Gandharvas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Tumburu was the son of Kaśyapa, son of
Marīci and grandson of Brahmā, born of his wife
Pradhā. Of the sons of Kaśyapa the four Gandharva
sons, Tumburu, Bāhu, Hāhā and Hūhū were noted for
their sweet and pleasant conversation.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Tumburu and the Pāṇḍavas.%} Mahābhārata states
about several occasions when Tumburu has shown a
special and deep interest in the Pāṇḍavas. The follow-
ing few are of special mention—
<div n="NI"/>(i) Tumburu attended the Janmotsava of Arjuna.
(Śloka 54, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once this Gandharva gave Yudhiṣṭhira a hundred
horses. (Śloka 24, Chapter 52, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Tumburu welcomed Arjuna when the latter went
to Devaloka at the invitation of Indra. (Vana Parva,
Chapter 43, Verse 14).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Once when the Pāṇḍavas were living incognito in
the country of Virāṭa the Kauravas carried away the
cattle of the King. Arjuna in disguise then fought
against the Kauravas and Tumburu watched the fight
with interest. (Śloka 12, Chapter 56, Virāṭa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Tumburu was present at the Aśvamedhayāga of
Yudhiṣṭhira. (Śloka 39, Chapter 88, Aśvamedha
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Tumburu was born as Virādha.%} When Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa were in the forests in exile a demon named
[Page799-a+ 64]
Virādha attacked them. That demon was none other
than Tumburu. Once when Tumburu was living in the
city of Kubera he committed a sin and Kubera cursed
him and made him into a demon. Kubera had then
told him that he would get relief from the curse when
he was slain by Rāma, son of Daśaratha. Śrī Rāma
killed Virādha and the latter regaining the form of
Tumburu left for Gandharvaloka. (See under Virādha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How he cursed Purūravas.%} It is found in Kathāsaritsā-
gara that the temporary separation which Purūravas
had from Urvaśī was due to a curse by the Gandharva
Tumburu.
<div n="NI"/>After marrying Urvaśī Purūravas once went to Deva-
loka at the invitation of Indra. He was invited to help
Indra in his fight against the asuras. Indra celebrated
the day on which one of the best of the demons, Māyā-
dhara was killed. Rambhā was dancing before ācārya
Tumburu on the occasion and Purūravas finding fault
with her dance mocked at her. Rambhā felt insulted
and asked the King thus: “Fool of a King, what do
you know of the divine dances of Devaloka?” Purūra-
vas retorted that he had learnt more of dancing from
Urvaśī than what her preceptor Tumburu knew. Tum-
buru got angry and cursed Purūravas that he would
live separated from Urvaśī till he did penance to please
Mahāviṣṇu. The Gandharvas then carried away
Urvaśī from Purūravas. (See under Purūravas).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Tumburu was a member of the court of Indra.
(Śloka 14, Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Tumburu was a member of the court of Kubera.
(Śloka 26, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The songs of Tumburu who was a worshipper of
Kubera used to be heard from the mountain of Gan-
dhamādana on the full-moon day. (Śloka 29, Chapter
159, Vana Parva).
