PṚTHU I¦. (VAINYA). A King of great virtue born in
the line of Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
Brahmā—Svāyambhuva Manu—Uttānapāda—Dhruva
Śiṣṭi—Ripu—Cākṣuṣa Manu—Kuru—Aṅga—Vena—
Pṛthu.
<div n="NI"/>Manu, son of Cākṣuṣa, got of his wife Naḍvalā eleven
sons Puru, Kuru, Pūru, Śatadyumna, Tapasvī, Satya-
vāk, Śuci, Agniṣṭu, Atiratha, Sudyumna and
Abhimanyu. Of these the second son Kuru got of his
wife Ātreyī seven sons named Aṅga, Sumanas, Svāti
Kratu, Aṅgiras, Gaya and Śibi. Aṅga married Sunīthā.
She delivered a very wicked son named Vena. Pṛthu
was born to Vena. Pṛthu got six sons named Antar-
dhāna, Vādī, Sūta, Māgadha, Pālita and Vijitāśva.
[Page608-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and Coronation.%} Sunīthā, wife of Aṅga, was
the eldest daughter of Yama. Vena was born of her.
Vena, the grandson of Yama, because of hereditary
traits from his grandfather, was very wicked even from
birth. When Vena was crowned king by the maharṣis
and he became the supreme lord of the world he an-
nounced to the world thus: “Yāgas should not be per-
formed; gifts should not be given; no kind of homa
should be done. There is nobody but me to accept as
Yajñapuruṣa the share of yajñas. I am the sole lord and
consumer of yajñas.”
<div n="NI"/>The sages were dumbfounded. They all approached
Vena and impressed upon him the necessity of perform-
ing a Yāga to propitiate Mahāviṣṇu. Vena who got
angry at this request of the sages told them thus:
“There is nobody greater than I and I have none to be
worshipped. Who is Hari, your Yajñeśvara? (lord of
the yāga). All such great powers who can bless and
curse alike and such eminent deities and entities like
Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva, Indra, Vāyu, Yama, Varuṇa,
Sūrya, Agni, Dhātā, Pūṣā, Bhūmi and Candra are
merged in me, the king. Do understand this fact and
obey my orders.”
<div n="NI"/>Despite repeated requests Vena did not give permission
to conduct a Vaiṣṇava yajña. The sages got angry and
cried aloud “Kill this wicked man”, “Kill this wicked
man”. Saying thus the sages killed Vena by Kuśa grass
made sacred and powerful by mantras—Vena, who was
spiritually dead because of his contempt of the gods
even before. Then the sages saw dust rising in columns
from all sides and asked the people the cause of the
same. The people said “When they knew that there was
no king poor people have turned themselves into rogues
and are plundering the wealth of the rich. The swift
movements of these running in haste are raising dust
from the ground below.”
<div n="NI"/>The ṛṣis conferred together and to get a son from
the dead Vena they churned the thigh of the wicked
king. Then from the thigh came out a short and black
(as black as a burnt pillar) man with a compressed face
who stood before the sages in distress and asked “What
am I to do?” The sages said ‘Niṣīda’ meaning ‘sit
down’. He thus became Niṣāda (an illiterate forest-
dweller). He went to the mountain of Vindhya and
along with him went all the sins of Vena. Niṣādas there-
after are said to be those who have destroyed the sins
of Vena.
<div n="NI"/>Then the sages churned the right hand of Vena and
from it came out a brilliant boy of great strength and
power and he was named Pṛthu. At the time of his
birth there dropped from heaven the divine bow Aja-
gava and many powerful arrows and a divine armour.
All animate objects of the world were happy at his birth.
Vena attained svarga for having delivered such a brilli-
ant son. For the coronation of Pṛthu the oceans brought
very many precious diamonds and the rivers holy water.
Brahmā along with Āṅgirases came and crowned Pṛthu
as the emperor. Brahmā saw the line of Candra in his
right hand and was, therefore, pleased to know that he
was part of Mahāviṣṇu. Thus Pṛthu, valiant and brill-
iant, was crowned their emperor by the virtuous people
of Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>He united his people by his love for them. When he
travelled through the ocean the water stood still and
[Page609-a+ 64]
when he travelled on land the mountains gave way and
his flag-pole was never obstructed anywhere.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sūta-Māgadhas.%} Brahmā performed a yāga as soon
as Pṛthu was born. From that yāga was born a very
wise and intelligent demon named Sūta. A scholarly
Māgadha also was born from the yāga. The maharṣis
commanded the Sūta-Māgadhas to praise Pṛthu and
they then said “Oh revered sages, we do not know
anything good or bad about this king just born. He
has not earned a name or fame. Then on what basis
are we to sing praises about him?” The maharṣis said
that they should praise him for the qualities he should
have in future. Pṛthu heard that and feeling elated
decided to become a very virtuous emperor. When
Pṛthu was thinking like that the Sūta-Māgadhas sang
in melodious tones thus: “This king speaks the truth
always, is charitable, is one who keeps his promises,
is valiant and full of all good qualities.” Thus with the
blessings and good wishes of all, Pṛthu started his reign.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Pṛthu attacks the Earth.%} The people were hungry
for want of proper food crops. They approached Pṛthu
and told him that during the short interval between
Vena's death and Pṛthu's assuming charge the goddess
of earth drew inside all her vegetations and so the peo-
ple were put to great difficulties. They requested him
to generate vegetations again.
<div n="NI"/>Pṛthu got angry on hearing this and taking his bow
Ajagava and several arrows went in search of the god-
dess of earth. The goddess got frightened and fled taking
the form of a cow. She went to all lokas but Pṛthu fol-
lowed her with his bow and arrows everywhere. At last
desiring to escape from the arrows of such a valiant
king Bhūmidevī went to him and trembling with fear said
“Oh king, why do you make such a persistent attempt,
to kill me which would be the great sin of Strīvadha?
(killing a woman).” The Rājā replied that there was
no sin in killing wicked persons. The goddess asked
what refuge was there for the people if the earth was
destroyed. The king said that he would protect his
people by the power of his yoga. Bhūmidevī was fright-
ened and she said “Oh king, I shall give you back all
I have destroyed in the form of milk. Therefore, virt-
uous as you are, if you are really interested in the wel-
fare of the people I shall allow you to milk me and
take back everything you want. Do bring a calf.”
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Pṛthu milks the Earth.%} Pṛthu by the end of his bow
put in arrangement at one place the thousands of
mountains which were lying scattered over the country.
The grounds were not even and so there were formerly
no divisions into villages and towns. There were no
grain-plants like paddy or wheat, no agriculture, no
cow-protection and no trade. It was since the time of
Pṛthu that all these came into being. People desired
to live in places where the grounds were even. Then
the people lived on fruits, leaves and roots. When they
were all destroyed people found it difficult to live.
<div n="NI"/>Therefore Pṛthu making Svāyambhuva Manu as calf
milked for the welfare of his people all plants from the
earth. People do live even today by what was milked
then. Pṛthu, because he gave life to Bhūmidevī,
became her father and she got the name Pṛthvī.
<div n="NI"/>The brahmin sages milked the cow of earth again.
Then Agastya became the calf and Bṛhaspati milked.
When the planets milked, Candra became the calf and
[Page609-b+ 65]
again Bṛhaspati milked. The devas even now feed on
the Ūrjjakṣīra (milk rich in food value) they got then.
All the animals live because of their virtue and truth.
The ṛṣis milked truth and virtue. The manes made
Yama the calf and Antaka the milker. They milked
Svadhā in a silver pot. The cobras and serpents
making Takṣaka the calf milked poison making
Dhṛtarāṣṭra the milker. They live by their poison
which is their great defence also. The daityas and
dānavas using Virocana as calf and making the two-
headed Ṛtvik Madhu as the milker milked jointly
courage, valour and the sarvaśatruvināśinī māyā
(māyā, the destroyer of all enemies). They milked in
an iron pot. All their knowledge, bodily health,
strength, vigour, brilliance and valour are made from
this and that is why they are adepts in the art of
māyā even now.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣas milked in an iron pot milk that disappeared
from the earth. Rajatanābha milked using Vaiśravaṇa
as calf. That Yakṣarājaputra was sarvajña (knowing
all) and Sarvadharmajña (conversant with all charitable
things) with two heads and eight hands. The rākṣasas,
piśācas and wicked maruts using Rajatanābha as milker
and Sumālī as the calf milked blood in a pot made of a
skull. They live on this.
<div n="NI"/>The Gandharvas and nymphs using lotus as their pot,
Suruci as milker and Citraratha as calf milked music
from her. The mountains making Mahāmeru as milker
and Himālayas as the calf milked diamonds and
medicines. The sacred trees made Sāla the milker and
plakṣa the calf and milked in a pot of palāśa Chinna-
dagdhaprarohaṇa (the power of growing again even
if cut or burnt). The siddhaguhyakacāraṇavidyādharas
also milked her each using different pots, calves and
milkers and they all got what they wanted.
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Aśvamedha.%} Pṛthu's land became rich and
prosperous. Then he performed an Aśvamedha. The
Yāga horse was led by Vijitāśva, son of Pṛthu. Indra
did not like Pṛthu conducting the yāga. Indra hid at
a place on the path of the yāga horse. The sage Atri
helped Indra. Indra bound the horse and a fight
ensued between Indra and Vijitāśva in which Indra
was deplorably defeated and confessing his guilt he
craved for pardon and Pṛthu granting him pardon
became his great friend. (4th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Pṛthu's rule.%} In the history of Bhārata the period
of Pṛthu's rule is considered a golden period. When
Pṛthu became the emperor, Brahmā divided the uni-
verse into several kingdoms and made a separate ruler
for each of them. Soma was appointed King of the
stars, planets, brahmins, plants, yāgas and austerities.
He appointed Kubera as the lord of Kings, Varuṇa as
the lord of all waters, Viṣṇu, as the lord of all ādityas
and Pāvaka as the lord of all Vasus. Dakṣa was given
lordship over prajāpatis, Indra over maruts, and
Prahlāda over all daityas and dānavas. Yama, the
Dharmarāja was made lord of the manes. Airāvata
was made King of all elephants and Garuḍa King of
all birds. Uccaiśśravas was made King of all horses
and Vṛṣabha of all cattle. The lion was made King of
all beasts and Himavān the lord of all immovable
things. Kapila became chief of all sages and the tiger
the leader of all beasts with nails and snouts. Plakṣa
was made the King of all trees.
<div n="NI"/>After distributing kingdoms thus, Brahmā appointed
[Page610-a+ 64]
Dikpālakas (guardians of the zones). In the east he
posted Sudhanvā, son of Vairājaprajāpati, in the
south he posted Śaṅkhapāda son of Kardamaprajāpati,
in the west he put Ketumān, son of Rajas and in the
north Hiraṇyaromā. Thus Brahmā organised a
universe with suitable emperors to control and super-
vise. (Chapter 22, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The end of Pṛthu.%} After several years of benign
rule Pṛthu became old. He then entrusted the affairs
of the state to his son Vijitāśva and left for penance
with his wife Arccis. After doing severe penance for
a long time he merged with Parabrahman. Arccis who
was all along serving her husband with devotion
ended her life by jumping into the funeral pyre of her
husband following her husband like Lakṣmī following
Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Pṛthu's sons.%} Pṛthu had five sons named Vijitāśva,
Haryakṣa, Dhūmrakeśa, Vṛka and Draviṇa.
The eldest of these Vijitāśva, with the help of his
brothers ruled the country. Haryakṣa ruled over the
east, Dhūmrakeśa over the south, Vṛka, west and
Draviṇa, north. (Padma Purāṇa).
