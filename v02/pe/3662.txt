KṚṢṆA¦ (ŚRĪ KṚṢṆA). Born in the Yādava dynasty
<div n="lb"/>as the son of Vasudeva and Devakī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the
<div n="lb"/>ninth of the ten incarnations of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā

<div n="lb"/>—Yayāti—Yadu—Sahasrajit—Śatajit—Hehaya—

<div n="NI"/>Ten sons called Vasudeva, Devabhāga, Devaśravas,
<div n="lb"/>Ānaka, Sṛñjaya, Kākānīka, Śyāmaka, Vatsa, Kāvūka
<div n="lb"/>and Vasu were born to King Śūrasena by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Māriṣā. Of those ten sons Vasudeva married Devakī,
<div n="lb"/>the sister of Kaṃsa. He had also a second wife called
<div n="lb"/>Rohiṇī and she was the mother of Balabhadrarāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa's former births.%} Owing to a curse of
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, Kaśyapaprajāpati was born on earth as
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva and his (Kaśyapa) wives Aditi and Surasā
<div n="lb"/>were born as Devakī and Rohiṇī. (See under Kaśyapa
<div n="lb"/>and Aditi). Like this Śrī Kṛṣṇa also had previous births.
<div n="lb"/>Once upon a time from the heart of Brahmā was
<div n="lb"/>born the Prajāpati called Dharma, who was very truth-
<div n="lb"/>ful and wedded to righteous living according to the
<div n="lb"/>injunctions of the Vedas. He wedded the ten daughters
<div n="lb"/>of Dakṣaprajāpati, and four sons called Hari, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>Nara and Nārāyaṇa were born to him. Hari and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa turned out to be great Yogins, and Nara and
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa ascetics. Naranārāyaṇas performed penance
<div n="lb"/>to please Brahmā for a thousand years at Badarik-
<div n="lb"/>āśrama in the valley of the Himālayas. Celestial
<div n="lb"/>women, whom Indra had deputed to break their
<div n="lb"/>penance, approached them and requested them to take
<div n="lb"/>them (celestial women) as their wives. Ascetic Nārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa who got angry at the celestial women's request
<div n="lb"/>was about to curse them when sage Nara intervened
<div n="lb"/>and pacified him. Then sage Nārāyaṇa told them
<div n="lb"/>thus:—“You must protect my Vrata (penance) in
[Page420-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>this life. In that case, in the next birth I shall satisfy
<div n="lb"/>your desire. In the 28th Dvāparayuga I will be
<div n="lb"/>incarnating on earth on behalf of the Devas. Then you
<div n="lb"/>also may be born as princesses. I shall incarnate as
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa in the Yadu dynasty and marry all of you.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly sage Nārāyaṇa was born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa in
<div n="lb"/>the Yadu dynasty, and sage Nara was born as Arjuna to
<div n="lb"/>be his companion.
<div n="NI"/>The curse of Bhṛgu the great sage also contributed to
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu's incarnating himself as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Once
<div n="lb"/>in a war which lasted for 100 years between the Devas
<div n="lb"/>and the Asuras most of the latter were killed. Then
<div n="lb"/>Śukra, preceptor of the Asuras went to Mount
<div n="lb"/>Kailāsa to secure exceptional weapons, and the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>took refuge under Kāvyamātā, the mother of Śukra.
<div n="lb"/>Devendra sought Mahāviṣṇu's aid, and he cut off
<div n="lb"/>Kāvyamātā's head with his Cakra (discus). Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>was enraged at this killing of a woman. He cursed that
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu should be born as man. Owing to various
<div n="lb"/>reasons like the above Mahāviṣṇu happened to be
<div n="lb"/>born as man in the Yādava dynasty, as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva. (Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Vasudeva's wedding.%} To Śūrasena, the Yādava King
<div n="lb"/>of Mathurāpurī was born a son called Vasudeva, and
<div n="lb"/>Devakī was born as the grand-daughter of Devaka, the
<div n="lb"/>brother of Ugrasena, another Yādava King. Devakī
<div n="lb"/>was the sister of Kaṃsa. Devakī was given in marriage
<div n="lb"/>to Vasudeva with a dowry of twelve bhāras (a
<div n="lb"/>particular weight) of gold and a chariot. Kaṃsa
<div n="lb"/>acted as charioteer in the wedding procession during
<div n="lb"/>which a celestial voice addressed Kaṃsa as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>‘Asyāḥ tvām aṣṭamagarbho hantā’ (Her eighth son
<div n="lb"/>will kill you). As soon as he heard the celestial voice
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa stood up in the chariot ablaze with rage. He
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of Devakī by her hair and raised his
<div n="lb"/>sword to cut her throat. All the conciliatory words of
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva failed to pacify Kaṃsa. Then Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>promised to hand over to Kaṃsa all the children born
<div n="lb"/>to Devakī immediately after their birth. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa left them alone.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%First-born son of Vasudeva.%} The first-born child of
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva was duly handed over to Kaṃsa. But, he
<div n="lb"/>returned the child to its parents as, according to the
<div n="lb"/>celestial voice the first-born child was not to be his
<div n="lb"/>enemy. Vasudeva and Devakī brought it up under the
<div n="lb"/>name Kīrtimān. On one of those days Nārada visited
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa and told him about his previous life, the
<div n="lb"/>object of Kṛṣṇa's incarnation etc. Then it was that
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa realised how fatal to him was the existence of
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva and Devakī, and he hurried up to them and
<div n="lb"/>killed the child by dashing its head against a rock. He
<div n="lb"/>also kept them chained in prison.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaṃsa's excitement.%} The information imparted by
<div n="lb"/>Nārada upset Kaṃsa much. He shut his father
<div n="lb"/>Ugrasena in prison and himself became King. He
<div n="lb"/>deputed Asuras like Pralamba, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta,
<div n="lb"/>Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭa, Keśī, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and
<div n="lb"/>Pūtanā to harass the Yādavas, the Andhakas and the
<div n="lb"/>Vṛṣṇis. After the death of Kīrtimān, Devakī, in the
<div n="lb"/>prison, delivered five sons. (See under Kaṃsa. Para 2
<div n="lb"/>for the previous history of the first six sons of Devakī).
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa killed all the five children also as soon as they
<div n="lb"/>were born.
[Page421-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Birth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} The Asuras killed in the old
<div n="lb"/>Devāsura war were later born as cruel and evil Kings
<div n="lb"/>on earth. The burden of such Kings having become
<div n="lb"/>too much for her, goddess Earth, in the guise of a cow
<div n="lb"/>complained about it to Brahmā who took her to Śiva
<div n="lb"/>who too could not find a solution to the problem posed
<div n="lb"/>by Bhūmidevī. So, all of them accompanied by the
<div n="lb"/>Devas approached Mahāviṣṇu and prayed for the
<div n="lb"/>redress of their grievance. Mahāviṣṇu sent them back
<div n="lb"/>comforted by the assurance that he would be born as
<div n="lb"/>the son of Vasudeva and Devakī to solve the problem.
<div n="lb"/>He also arranged the Devas to be born as Gopas and
<div n="lb"/>the Apsarā women as Gopikās on earth for his
<div n="lb"/>assistance.
<div n="NI"/>Devakī conceived for the 7th time, and it was an aspect
<div n="lb"/>of Ananta. Mahāviṣṇu instructed Māyādevī thus:
<div n="lb"/>“You go to the earth and transfer the child in Devakī's
<div n="lb"/>womb to that of Rohiṇī, the second wife of Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>and after that, at the very time of my birth you
<div n="lb"/>should be born as daughter of Yaśodā, wife of
<div n="lb"/>Nandagopa. You would be worshipped by the world
<div n="lb"/>in various names like Ambikā, Nārāyaṇī, Caṇḍikā,
<div n="lb"/>Durgā, Bhadrakālī etc. The child transferred by you to
<div n="lb"/>the womb of Rohiṇī will become known as Saṅkarṣaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadra and Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Māyādevī transferred the child in Devakī's
<div n="lb"/>womb to that of Rohiṇī, and it was given out that the
<div n="lb"/>seventh child of Devakī was aborted in the womb.
<div n="lb"/>Devakī conceived for the eighth time, and on Aṣṭamī
<div n="lb"/>day in the month of Siṃha (Leo, August-September)
<div n="lb"/>when the Brāhma stars were collected on the same day
<div n="lb"/>was Śrī Kṛṣṇa born. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated himself
<div n="lb"/>as Kṛṣṇa with the conch, the discus, the club and the
<div n="lb"/>lotus flower in his four hands. Vasudeva saluted the
<div n="lb"/>marvellous child, and the chain that bound himself
<div n="lb"/>and Devakī broke asunder, and the new-born child
<div n="lb"/>spoke thus to Vasudeva:—“In Svāyambhuva Manvan-
<div n="lb"/>tara the Prajāpati called Sutapas with his wife Pṛśni
<div n="lb"/>meditated upon me for 12,000 years, and when I
<div n="lb"/>appeared to them and asked them to choose any boon
<div n="lb"/>they prayed for my being born as their son. In the
<div n="lb"/>next life Sutapas was born as Kaśyapa and Pṛśni as
<div n="lb"/>Aditi, and I incarnated in the form of Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>(Dwarf) as their son. Afterwards Kaśyapa and Aditi
<div n="lb"/>took various births, and I too took various births as
<div n="lb"/>their son. Now also, Kaśyapa and Aditi, are born as
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva and Devakī. Just at this time a daughter
<div n="lb"/>has been born to Nandagopa and Yaśodā at Gokula.
<div n="lb"/>You shall take me over there and replace me with the
<div n="lb"/>child born at Gokula.” After having told Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>the above facts Kṛṣṇa assumed the form of an ordinary
<div n="lb"/>child and lay by the side of its mother. At mid-night
<div n="lb"/>when the guards at the prison house were deep in sleep
<div n="lb"/>the doors of the prison opened by themselves. Vasudeva
<div n="lb"/>with the child Kṛṣṇa, started for Gokula and on his
<div n="lb"/>way the river Yamunā changed its course for him to
<div n="lb"/>proceed. The doors of Yaśodā's house were open.
<div n="lb"/>Owing to the divine prowess of Māyādevī, the child of
<div n="lb"/>Yaśodā, everybody in the house went into deep sleep.
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva placed Kṛṣṇa by the side of Yśodaā and
<div n="lb"/>returned home with her child. As soon as he had thus
<div n="lb"/>returned the prison-guards woke up and reported to
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa about the delivery of a child by Devakī.
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa rushed to the house, caught hold of the child
<div n="lb"/>and was about to dash it against the rock when lo!
[Page421-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>the child slipped free of his hands and rose in the sky
<div n="lb"/>wherefrom it spoke as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Oh! unrighteous and cruel Kaṃsa! thy prowess is
<div n="lb"/>not to be exhibited against women. Thy killer is born
<div n="lb"/>on earth, and search for him everywhere. (Śiva Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Colour of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was dark in colour and Balabhadra white. There is a
<div n="lb"/>story in the Mahābhārata to explain this difference in
<div n="lb"/>their colour. The Devas informed Mahāviṣṇu of their
<div n="lb"/>decision to incarnate themselves on earth for the
<div n="lb"/>annihilation of the evil and cruel people. Pleased at
<div n="lb"/>their decision Viṣṇu plucked from his head a black
<div n="lb"/>hair and also a white hair and threw them on the
<div n="lb"/>ground, and he said that the black hair would enter
<div n="lb"/>Devakī and be born as Kṛṣṇa while the white one
<div n="lb"/>would enter Rohiṇī and be born as Balabhadra.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly Kṛṣṇa became of the colour of the cloud
<div n="lb"/>(black) and Balabhadra white in colour. (Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 199, Verse 31).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The incidents during the childhood of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%}
<div n="lb"/>(1) {%Pūtanāmokṣa (Salvation to Pūtanā).%} Pūtanā, a
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasī and one of the assassins deputed by Kaṃsa to
<div n="lb"/>search out and kill Kṛṣṇa, went to Kṛṣṇa's house
<div n="lb"/>disguised as a Gopa woman and fed him on her breasts.
<div n="lb"/>But the child extracted her life also with her breast-
<div n="lb"/>milk, and she assumed her original form and fell down
<div n="lb"/>dead.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Śakaṭāsura killed.%} Kaṃsa next deputed the Asura
<div n="lb"/>called Śakaṭa to kill Kṛṣṇa. He approached the
<div n="lb"/>sleeping Kṛṣṇa in the form of a cart and raised great
<div n="lb"/>sound. Kṛṣṇa jumped awake and kicked the cart into
<div n="lb"/>hundreds of pieces. (See under Śakaṭa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Killed Tṛṇāvartāsura.%} Tṛṇāvarta, son of Tārakāsura,
<div n="lb"/>at the behest of Kaṃsa went to Ambāḍi in an invisible
<div n="lb"/>(formless) manner. Yaśodā was then breast-feeding
<div n="lb"/>child Kṛṣṇa, and the child appeared to gradually
<div n="lb"/>increase in weight. Yaśodā tried to lay the child on
<div n="lb"/>the bed, but had to lay him on the ground as it was too
<div n="lb"/>heavy for her to lift up to the bed. At once, Tṛṇā-
<div n="lb"/>varta, in the form of a whirl-wind, rose up to the sky
<div n="lb"/>carrying Kṛṣṇa along with him. Ambāḍi (Gokula)
<div n="lb"/>was chokingly filled with clouds of dust; the Gopālas
<div n="lb"/>cried out. But, Śrī Kṛṣṇa clasped round the Asura's
<div n="lb"/>neck and rested, and on account of the child's weight
<div n="lb"/>he could not rise any more. The child hardened its
<div n="lb"/>hands around the Asura's throat and he got killed and
<div n="lb"/>fell down with a thud on a rock. Yaśodā hurriedly
<div n="lb"/>took the child in her hands and covered it with kisses.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Tṛṇāvarta).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Naming.%} During this period the famous sage
<div n="lb"/>Garga visited Kṛṣṇa at Ambāḍi, and he informed
<div n="lb"/>Vasudeva and Devakī of the actual facts relating to
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. The son of Rohiṇī was brought there, and the
<div n="lb"/>sage named him Rāma, and Yaśodā's child Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>and blessed them. Thenceforth Rāma and Kṛṣṇa grew
<div n="lb"/>up in Ambāḍi as the apple of the people's eyes. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Garga).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%All the worlds in Kṛṣṇa's mouth.%} The Gopikās once
<div n="lb"/>saw Kṛṣṇa eating mud and informed Yaśodā of it, and
<div n="lb"/>she, in great anger, opened the child's mouth to look
<div n="lb"/>for the sand when she saw there all the worlds including
<div n="lb"/>herself and she closed her eyes in great alarm.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata 10th Skandha).
[Page422-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Kṛṣṇa drags Ulūkhala. (Mortar).%} Yaśodā was once
<div n="lb"/>breast-feeding Kṛṣṇa when she noticed milk flowing
<div n="lb"/>out of the boiling pan, and she put the child on the
<div n="lb"/>floor and went to attend to the boiling milk. Angry at
<div n="lb"/>this Kṛṣṇa broke the milk-pot by throwing a stone at
<div n="lb"/>it. Yaśodā then tried to bind the child to the mortar
<div n="lb"/>with a cord. But, any number of cords could not
<div n="lb"/>reach round the child's waist. At this trouble of his
<div n="lb"/>mother Kṛṣṇa decided to oblige her and then the first
<div n="lb"/>cord itself sufficed to bind him round the mortar. But,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa then began running, dragging the mortar
<div n="lb"/>behind him. Dragging the Ulūkhala behind him he
<div n="lb"/>passed through a narrow gap between two trees. The
<div n="lb"/>trees were shaken and at once the trees rose up in the
<div n="lb"/>sky as two Devas. The two trees were actually
<div n="lb"/>Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva, the sons of Vaiśravaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>both of whom had been cursed into the form of trees
<div n="lb"/>by Nārada. (See under Nalakūbara).
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Vatsāsura killed.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma
<div n="lb"/>were one day, engaged in sports along with the Gopālas
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of river Kālindī. At that time an Asura
<div n="lb"/>sent by Kaṃsa got into the ranks of the cows disguised
<div n="lb"/>as a cow. Śrī Kṛṣṇa understood it; Balabhadra also
<div n="lb"/>pointed out the new ‘cow’ to him. Then Kṛṣṇa leisure-
<div n="lb"/>ly went towards the herd of cattle, lifted the new ‘cow’
<div n="lb"/>by its legs and tail and dashed it against a peepal
<div n="lb"/>tree. The peepal tree and the one next to it were
<div n="lb"/>broken, and thus ended the life of Vatsāsura.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Baka killed%} On another occasion Kaṃsa deputed
<div n="lb"/>Bakāsura, brother of Pūtanā to kill Kṛṣṇa. He assumed
<div n="lb"/>the form of a bird, and lay there on the road with his
<div n="lb"/>fierce mouth wide open. The Gopālas were terror-
<div n="lb"/>stricken. But, Kṛṣṇa entered the cave-like mouth of the
<div n="lb"/>bird leaving his companions behind. The Asura
<div n="lb"/>closed his mouth, and the Gopālas cried out in fear
<div n="lb"/>and agony. But, Śrī Kṛṣṇa stirred round and round
<div n="lb"/>within Baka's stomach and he was forced to vomit
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa out. Along with Kṛṣṇa he vomited blood and
<div n="lb"/>died. (See under Baka).
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Killed Aghāsura.%} Aghāsura, brother of Baka and
<div n="lb"/>Pūtanā, deputed by Kaṃsa to kill Kṛṣṇa assumed the
<div n="lb"/>form of a serpent and with its mouth opened like a
<div n="lb"/>cave lay on the road used by the Gopālas. The stench
<div n="lb"/>that emanated from its mouth vitiated the atmosphere.
<div n="lb"/>The Gopālas including Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra entered
<div n="lb"/>the serpent's mouth, and immediately its entire body
<div n="lb"/>shook and it vomited blood. Life escaped through its
<div n="lb"/>broken stomach. The Gopālas came out of it and fell
<div n="lb"/>down unconscious. But, at the very sight of Kṛṣṇa they
<div n="lb"/>regained consciousness. (See under Agha).
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Brahmā placed in ridiculous situation.%} On another
<div n="lb"/>occasion Brahmā saw Mahāvisṇu, in the assumed form
<div n="lb"/>of man, playing on the banks of the Kālindī along with
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadra and his companions. To test whether God
<div n="lb"/>possessed powers in the assumed form of man also
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā carried away the cattle of the Gopālas. The
<div n="lb"/>Gopālas were naturally upset at the disappearance of
<div n="lb"/>their cows. After consoling them Kṛṣṇa searched for
<div n="lb"/>the cattle on the heights of mount Govardhana and in
<div n="lb"/>the forest. But, the cattle were to be found nowhere,
<div n="lb"/>and when Kṛṣṇa returned to the banks of the Kālindī
<div n="lb"/>the Gopālas too had disappeared. Divining the reason
<div n="lb"/>for the whole affair by his divine powers, Kṛṣṇa created
<div n="lb"/>both the Gopālas and the cows with his divine powers.
[Page422-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>One year passed by thus, and one day Kṛṣṇa and his
<div n="lb"/>companions with their cattle went to the top of
<div n="lb"/>Govardhana. Brahmā was alarmed to find Kṛṣṇa with
<div n="lb"/>the artificially created Gopālas and the cattle, and
<div n="lb"/>while he was looking at them the colour of all of them
<div n="lb"/>began changing and within minutes they put on the
<div n="lb"/>form of Viṣṇu. Moreover, he saw another Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaloka. Upset and alarmed by the whole
<div n="lb"/>phenomenon he sang the praises of Mahāviṣṇu at which
<div n="lb"/>his illusion was lifted and he saw the actual Kṛṣṇa, the
<div n="lb"/>Gopālas and the cattle.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Dhenukāsura killed.%} There lived in the Kadalī forest
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of the Kālindī an Asura called Dhenuka
<div n="lb"/>with his followers. The forest was thick with palm trees.
<div n="NI"/>Out of fear of the Asura nobody dared to travel in the
<div n="lb"/>forest. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra having heard the
<div n="lb"/>story about Dhenuka one day went to the forest with
<div n="lb"/>their companions. Balabhadra shook down a lot of the
<div n="lb"/>palm fruits, the Gopālas loudly cheered him. The
<div n="lb"/>Asura rushed forth challenging them when Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Balabhadra thrashed him to death.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Suppressed Kāliya.%} There lived in Kālindī a fierce
<div n="lb"/>serpent called Kāliya with his wife and relations. The
<div n="lb"/>trees on the banks of the river were withered and had
<div n="lb"/>dried up on account of the poisonous breath emitted by
<div n="lb"/>the serpent. One day the Gopālas and their cattle drank
<div n="lb"/>water in the Kālindī and fell down dead. Then Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>climbed a tree on the banks of the river and jumped
<div n="lb"/>into its waters and Kāliya rushed forward to him with
<div n="lb"/>his hoods spread out. Kṛṣṇa stepped on the hoods and
<div n="lb"/>danced thereon. Kāliya vomited blood, got exhausted
<div n="lb"/>and prayed to Kṛṣṇa for mercy. At the instance of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa the serpent with its family emigrated to the
<div n="lb"/>Ramaṇaka island. (See under Kāliya).
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Kṛṣṇa swallows fire.%} When Kṛṣṇa came out of the
<div n="lb"/>waters after having suppressed Kāliya and taking with
<div n="lb"/>him the gem presented by Kāliya, the Gopālas covered
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa with embraces. People of Ambāḍi came to the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Kālindī looking out for the children. As the
<div n="lb"/>sun had set by now the Yādavas spent the night there,
<div n="lb"/>when a wild fire enveloped them, and they cried out
<div n="lb"/>to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa swallowed the entire fire. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Killed Pralamba.%} While the Gopālas were playing
<div n="lb"/>once under the shade of a giant peepal tree called
<div n="lb"/>Bhāṇḍīraka an Asura known as Pralamba joined their
<div n="lb"/>games disguised as a Gopāla. Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
<div n="lb"/>understood the trick. They made all the others take
<div n="lb"/>the following pledge, i.e. that all of them would beat
<div n="lb"/>one another, and the vanquished should carry about
<div n="lb"/>the victor on his head. The beating began, and the
<div n="lb"/>Gopa called Śrīdāman defeated Kṛṣṇa. Vṛṣabha defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed Bhadrasena and Balabhadra defeated Pralamba.
<div n="lb"/>According to the pledge Śrī Kṛṣṇa carried on his
<div n="lb"/>shoulders Śrīdāman, Bhadrasena carried Vṛṣabha and
<div n="lb"/>Pralamba carried Balabhadra. But, Pralamba rose up
<div n="lb"/>to the skies with Balabhadra, who broke the former's
<div n="lb"/>head, and Pralamba fell down dead in his actual form
<div n="lb"/>as an Asura.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Again in wild fire.%} The Gopālas were once again
<div n="lb"/>caught in wild fire at the Muñja forest on the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Kālindī. They cried out in great fear when Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to them and asked them to remain standing with
<div n="lb"/>eyes closed. They obeyed him, and he swallowed the
<div n="lb"/>fire as though it were nectar. The Gopālas were aston-
[Page423-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ished to find themselves safe when they opened their
<div n="lb"/>eyes. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Blessed the wives of Brahmins.%} Kṛṣṇa and his com-
<div n="lb"/>panions one day travelled a long way along the banks
<div n="lb"/>of the Kālindī. They felt very hungry and Kṛṣṇa advis-
<div n="lb"/>ed them to request for food at brahmin houses. They
<div n="lb"/>begged for food the wives of brahmins, and the
<div n="lb"/>wives happy at Kṛṣṇa's presence there, came with food.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa blessed them. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Theft of clothes.%} Kṛṣṇa once picked up the clothes
<div n="lb"/>of the Gopa women who were bathing in the Kālindī and
<div n="lb"/>climbed to the top of a tree with the clothes and play-
<div n="lb"/>ed on his flute. The Gopa women came out of the river
<div n="lb"/>and saluted Kṛṣṇa with folded hands. He then returned
<div n="lb"/>the clothes to them. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Mount Govardhana used as Umbrella.%} Indra is the
<div n="lb"/>rain-God. The people of Ambāḍi used to perform yajña
<div n="lb"/>every year in favour of Indra for rain-fall. Kṛṣṇa oppos-
<div n="lb"/>ed the custom saying that Mount Govardhana was the
<div n="lb"/>house-hold deity of the people of Ambāḍi and it was
<div n="lb"/>enough for them to worship the mountain. The people
<div n="lb"/>of Ambāḍi, therefore, offered the Yajña they had arrang-
<div n="lb"/>ed that year for Indra to Govardhana. Angered at
<div n="lb"/>this Indra let loose heavy rains on Ambāḍi. Kṛṣṇa up-
<div n="lb"/>rooted and held Mount Govardhana like an umbrella
<div n="lb"/>lest the people should suffer from the heavy rains, and they
<div n="lb"/>took shelter under it. The rain did not stop even after
<div n="lb"/>seven days. Yet, due to Kṛṣṇa's kindness the people did
<div n="lb"/>not suffer any hardships. Beaten at his own game, Indra
<div n="lb"/>sang the praises of Kṛṣṇa. Devasurabhi (cow of the
<div n="lb"/>Devas) came and saluted Kṛṣṇa and anointed him, as
<div n="lb"/>the Indra of the Gopālas. The Devas addressed him
<div n="lb"/>‘Govinda’ meaning, he who protects the cattle. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(19) {%Nandagopa abducted by Varuṇa.%} Once after having
<div n="lb"/>observed Ekādaśīvrata Nanda bathed in the river Kāl-
<div n="lb"/>indī. At the instance of Varuṇa a Deva abducted and
<div n="lb"/>took him to the abode of Varuṇa. People of Ambāḍi were
<div n="lb"/>distressed at the disappearance of Nandagopa. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Balabhadra dived into the Kālindī and rose up at
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇālaya. Varuṇa told them that he had abducted
<div n="lb"/>Nandagopa so that he might see Viṣṇu in person, and
<div n="lb"/>requested to be pardoned. Meanwhile the people of
<div n="lb"/>Ambāḍi, who came to Kālindī saw all the worlds reflect-
<div n="lb"/>ed in it. Kṛṣṇa and Rāma returned to Ambāḍi with
<div n="lb"/>their father, Nandagopa. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(20) {%Rāsakrīḍā.%} At the advent of the spring the melody
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛṣṇa's flute rendered the Gopa women love-lorn.
<div n="lb"/>He went to Vṛndāvana with his flute, and all the
<div n="lb"/>Gopa women, both married and unmarried followed
<div n="lb"/>him. Kṛṣṇa made a futile attempt to send them back
<div n="lb"/>to their houses. But, the love-sick Gopa women did not.
<div n="lb"/>Suddenly Kṛṣṇa disappeared from among them, and the
<div n="lb"/>Gopa women mad with love roamed about Vṛndāva-
<div n="lb"/>na with Rādhā calling “O Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!” Suddenly
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa appeared before them. He entered the waters
<div n="lb"/>of the Kālindī with them and satisfied them. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>thus explained Bhaktiyoga to the world. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(21) {%Python swallowed Nandagopa.%} One day the Gopas
<div n="lb"/>performed Maheśvara Pūjā (worship) in Devī forest,
<div n="lb"/>and they spent the night without going to sleep on the
<div n="lb"/>banks of the Kālindī. A python from somewhere began
<div n="lb"/>swallowing Nandagopa. Though the Gopas tried their
<div n="lb"/>best the snake did not loosen its grip on Nandagopa.
[Page423-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Then Kṛṣṇa gave it a kick and the snake transformed
<div n="lb"/>itself into a Deva called Sudarśana. He was a Vidyā-
<div n="lb"/>dhara, who had been converted into a python by the
<div n="lb"/>curse of sage Aṅgiras. (See under Sudarśana).
<div n="NI"/>(22) {%Killed Ariṣṭāsura. (Vṛṣāsura).%} During this period
<div n="lb"/>Ariṣṭāsura, a follower of Kaṃsa, came to Ambāḍi dis-
<div n="lb"/>guised as an ox, and people got terror-stricken at the
<div n="lb"/>sight of the fierce ox. Kṛṣṇa engaged himself in a duel
<div n="lb"/>with the ox (Ariṣṭa) and killed it. (See under Ariṣṭa).
<div n="NI"/>(23) {%Killed Keśī.%} Kaṃsa then sent an Asura called Keśī
<div n="lb"/>to Ambāḍi. He approached Kṛṣṇa in the guise of a
<div n="lb"/>horse into whose mouth the latter thrust his hand, which
<div n="lb"/>began growing in size with the result that the Asura
<div n="lb"/>vomited blood and expired; Kṛṣṇa got the name
<div n="lb"/>Keśava as he killed Keśī. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(24) {%Killed Vyomāsura.%} Vyomāsura, son of Mayāsura
<div n="lb"/>was the last of the Asuras deputed by Kaṃsa to kill
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa. He joined the company of the Gopas disguised
<div n="lb"/>as a goat. Kṛṣṇa dragged him into a cave and killed
<div n="lb"/>him there. (Bhāgavata 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa quits Ambāḍi.%} When all the attempts of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa to do away with Kṛṣṇa failed he resorted to
<div n="lb"/>another trick. Kaṃsa invited Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra,
<div n="lb"/>feigning great affection, to witness the dhanur yajña
<div n="lb"/>(worshipping the bow) being held at Mathurāpurī, the
<div n="lb"/>capital of the country. The invitation was sent through
<div n="lb"/>Akrūra, a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He went to Ambāḍi
<div n="lb"/>with a chariot and delivered to Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa's invitation to them for the fourteen days'dhanur
<div n="lb"/>yajña. The Gopas and Gopīs shed tears at the prospect
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛṣṇa leaving Ambāḍi. But, Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
<div n="lb"/>took leave of them and started for Mathurāpurī in the
<div n="lb"/>chariot brought by Akrūra. On their way to Mathurā
<div n="lb"/>they bathed in the Kālindī and when they dived in its
<div n="lb"/>waters Akrūra saw the Viśvarūpa (Cosmic form of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa). After the bath they continued their journey
<div n="lb"/>when Akrūra informed Kṛṣṇa in secret, about all the
<div n="lb"/>evil tactics of Kaṃsa and requested him to kill the
<div n="lb"/>latter. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>10). {%Rāma and Kṛṣṇa in Mathurāpurī.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Rajakavadha (the washerman is slain).%} Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa duly reached Mathurāpurī, and in the evening
<div n="lb"/>they went out for a stroll in the city to view its beauties
<div n="lb"/>when they saw a washerman carrying the washed clothes
<div n="lb"/>of Kaṃsa. They asked him for some of the clothes but
<div n="lb"/>the washerman not only refused them the clothes but
<div n="lb"/>also ridiculed them calling them cattle-breeders. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa thrashed the washerman on the spot and distri-
<div n="lb"/>buted the clothes among the children who had gather-
<div n="lb"/>ed there, himself wearing a yellow cloth from the stock
<div n="lb"/>and giving a blue one to Balabhadra.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Kañcukakāra (tailor) given salvation.%} Next, they
<div n="lb"/>saw a tailor who used to stitch shirts, turbans etc. for
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa. He presented costly shirts and turbans to Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa gave him salvation and distributed
<div n="lb"/>the clothes to the Gopas with him.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Sudāman presents garlands.%} Then Kṛṣṇa and Rāma
<div n="lb"/>entered the house of Sudāman who gave them each a
<div n="lb"/>garland. Kṛṣṇa blessed him.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Straightened the hunch-back Trivakrā.%} Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa continued their walk when they saw a female
<div n="lb"/>hunch-back coming opposite to them with a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>vessel filled with aṅgarāga (fragrant things like sandal-
[Page424-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>wood, musk etc. reduced into a paste to be smeared on
<div n="lb"/>the body). She told them that she was the maid-in-
<div n="lb"/>attendance of Kaṃsa; her name was Trivakrā and the
<div n="lb"/>aṅgarāga in the vessel was for the use of Kaṃsa. She
<div n="lb"/>felt pure love for Kṛṣṇa and gave him the aṅgarāga
<div n="lb"/>along with the vessel. Rāma and Kṛṣṇa smeared their
<div n="lb"/>bodies with it. Kṛṣṇa stepped on her feet and with his
<div n="lb"/>right hand raised her chin upwards and she was cured
<div n="lb"/>of her hunch. Her love for Kṛṣṇa knew no bounds and
<div n="lb"/>she begged him to spend the night in her house. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>promised to oblige her on another occasion and conti-
<div n="lb"/>nued the walk.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kṛṣṇa broke the bow.%} Rāma and Kṛṣṇa continued
<div n="lb"/>their walk into the Yajña hall of Kaṃsa. A big bow
<div n="lb"/>was seen there, and Kṛṣṇa broke it with his left hand
<div n="lb"/>before the guards could approach him. With the broken
<div n="lb"/>pieces of the bow he killed the soldiers sent by Kaṃsa to
<div n="lb"/>take him and Rāma into custody. They again continued
<div n="lb"/>their walk. The sun set, and though they lay down to
<div n="lb"/>sleep thoughts about the underhand dealings of Kaṃsa
<div n="lb"/>kept them sleepless.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Kṛṣṇa killed the fierce elephant.%} That night Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>dreamt many an inauspicious dream. The next morning
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa set up an arena for pugilistic combats. Yādava
<div n="lb"/>chiefs like Nandagopa, many other important persons in
<div n="lb"/>Mathurā and Kaṃsa took their seats on the dais. Famous
<div n="lb"/>pugilists like Cāṇūra, Muṣṭika, Kūṭa, Śala and Kosala
<div n="lb"/>also entered the scene. Kaṃsa had stationed a fierce
<div n="lb"/>elephant called Kuvalayāpīḍa on the way Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa had to take to enter the arena for pugilistic
<div n="lb"/>competition. The mahout prompted the elephant to
<div n="lb"/>catch hold of Kṛṣṇa, and in the fight that ensued with
<div n="lb"/>the animal Kṛṣṇa killed it and gave one tusk of it to
<div n="lb"/>Rāma. Kṛṣṇa beat the mahout also to death with the
<div n="lb"/>tusk. After this they entered the scene.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Kaṃsa killed.%} The pugilistic competition started.
<div n="lb"/>Cāṇūra fought against Kṛṣṇa and Muṣṭika against
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and both Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika were killed. Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa killed three other famous pugilists too, who
<div n="lb"/>confronted them following the death of Cāṇūra and
<div n="lb"/>Muṣṭika. Thereupon the remaining pugilists ran away
<div n="lb"/>into the forest. Kaṃsa, burning with anger, jumped up
<div n="lb"/>from his seat roaring, “Annihilate the Gopālas, kill
<div n="lb"/>Nandgopa, drown Ugrasena, the friend of our enemies,
<div n="lb"/>in the Kālindī” etc. Responding to Kaṃsa's war-cry
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa jumped into the former's sofa and pushed him
<div n="lb"/>down. Kṛṣṇa jumped on to the back of Kaṃsa and
<div n="lb"/>killed him. Balabhadra killed with his iron club the
<div n="lb"/>eight brothers of Kaṃsa who rushed against Kṛṣṇa. After
<div n="lb"/>consoling the women, who lamented over the death of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa and others Śrī Kṛṣṇa got their dead bodies duly
<div n="lb"/>cremated. Rāma and Kṛṣṇa released Vasudeva and
<div n="lb"/>Devakī and Ugrasena immediately from prison. Ugra-
<div n="lb"/>sena was crowned King of Mathurā.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Farewell to the people of Ambāḍi.%} Rāma and Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>saluted Nandagopa and Yaśodā, and entrusted to them
<div n="lb"/>their clothes and bows for safe custody. Then saying
<div n="lb"/>that they would return after strengthening the Yadu
<div n="lb"/>dynasty, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa sent their parents and the
<div n="lb"/>other Gopas home. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Education of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.%}
<div n="lb"/>(1) After bidding adieu to the people of Ambāḍi, Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>deva, on the advice of sage Garga sent Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa for their studies to the Āśrama of the great sage
<div n="lb"/>Sāndīpani. During their education at the Āśrama Kṛṣṇa
[Page424-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and Kucela became intimate friends. One day, at the in-
<div n="lb"/>stance of the wife of their preceptor, Kṛṣṇa and Kucela
<div n="lb"/>went into the forest to gather firewood. In the heavy
<div n="lb"/>rain and storm that followed they lost their track and
<div n="lb"/>wandered about in the forest. The next day the precep-
<div n="lb"/>tor brought them back from the forest. Kṛṣṇa learned
<div n="lb"/>the sixty-four arts and dhanurveda (science of archery)
<div n="lb"/>at the feet of Sāndīpani. (Bhārata, Southern Text,
<div n="lb"/>Page 802; Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Gurudakṣiṇā (Preceptor's fees).%} When Rāma and
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa completed their studies they asked the precep-
<div n="lb"/>tor as to what he wanted by way of tuition fee, and
<div n="lb"/>the guru wanted to get back his son, who was, years
<div n="lb"/>ago, drowned in Prabhāsa tīrtha. Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Rāma and Kṛṣṇa went in their chariot to Varuṇa at the
<div n="lb"/>sea coast. Varuṇa told them that it was the Asura
<div n="lb"/>called Pañcajana, who lived in the sea in the form of
<div n="lb"/>a conch, who had killed their preceptor's son. Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa entered the sea and killed the Asura. But, the
<div n="lb"/>child was not to be seen inside the conch. Blowing
<div n="lb"/>this conch, which in later years became famous as
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcajanya, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa went to Yama's abode,
<div n="lb"/>who on being told about the object of their visit return-
<div n="lb"/>ed the child to Rāma and Kṛṣṇa. They presented the
<div n="lb"/>child to their preceptor. He blessed them and they
<div n="lb"/>returned to Mathurāpurī.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Upto Kṛṣṇa's return to Dvārakā.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Message through Uddhava.%} Rāma and Kṛṣṇa who
<div n="lb"/>returned to Mathurāpurī after their studies at Sāndī-
<div n="lb"/>pani's Āśrama thought about the people of Ambāḍi.
<div n="lb"/>It was a long time since they had heard about them. So
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa sent a massage to Ambāḍi by his minis-
<div n="lb"/>ter Uddhava. After duly delivering the message
<div n="lb"/>Uddhava stayed at Ambāḍi four or five months after
<div n="lb"/>which he returned to Mathurā with the presents given
<div n="lb"/>to Kṛṣṇa by Nandagopa, Yaśodā and the other Gopas.
<div n="lb"/>(2) {%Visited Trivakrā.%} Kṛṣṇa had promised to visit the
<div n="lb"/>house of Trivakrā at the time he cured her of her
<div n="lb"/>hunch, and she had been for long awaiting Kṛṣṇa. But
<div n="lb"/>only now he got the opportunity to fulfil his promise.
<div n="lb"/>He accepted her hospitality at her house and thus
<div n="lb"/>ended her grief.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Interested himself in the Pāṇḍavas.%} By this time
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu had died. The Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī, sister of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's father were living at Hastināpura along with
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas. They were victims to all sorts of miseries.
<div n="lb"/>Hearing about the sad plight of the Pāṇḍavas Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>deputed Akrūra to Hastināpura to enquire about them.
<div n="lb"/>Kuntīdevī, with tears in her eyes, told Akrūra about
<div n="lb"/>the injustice being done against the Pāṇḍavas by the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas and the continuous attempts being made to kill
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma. Akrūra visited important persons like Vidura,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra etc. Akrūra exhorted Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who had
<div n="lb"/>succeeded Pāṇḍu as King, to mete out equal justice to
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas as well as to the Pāṇḍavas. Akrūra returned
<div n="lb"/>to Mathurā and gave a report to Kṛṣṇa about his visit
<div n="lb"/>to the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%The Jarāsandha war.%} Asti and Prāpti, wives of
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa complained about the killing of their husband
<div n="lb"/>by Kṛṣṇa to their father Jarāsandha, King of Magadha.
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha, aided by such famous Kings as Sālva,
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga, Cedirāja, Dantavaktra and Śiśupāla besieged
<div n="lb"/>Mathurāpurī with a big army. Yādava leaders like
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa, Balabhadra, Uddhava, Akrūra and Kṛtavarman
<div n="lb"/>met the enemies in battle in which many kings got
[Page425-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>killed. Balabhadra met Jarāsandha in duel, but let him
<div n="lb"/>off on the request of Kṛṣṇa. But, Jarāsandha, supported
<div n="lb"/>by Bāṇāsura and others besieged Mathurā again and
<div n="lb"/>again. When Balabhadra attempted to kill Jarāsandha,
<div n="lb"/>a celestial voice declared that it was not possible for
<div n="lb"/>the former to kill Jarāsandha, and the war, therefore,
<div n="lb"/>ended for the time being.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra meet Paraśurāma.%} The conti-
<div n="lb"/>nuous war with Jarāsandha reduced the financial re-
<div n="lb"/>sources of the Yādavas and to replenish their treasury
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra started for mount Gomantaka
<div n="lb"/>the repository of gems and on their way they saw
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma engaged in penance under a peepal tree.
<div n="lb"/>Paraśurāma told them that there was a kingdom at the
<div n="lb"/>foot of the Gomantaka called Karavīra ruled by King
<div n="lb"/>Sṛgālavāsudeva and advised them to kill him and collect
<div n="lb"/>enough money and gems. Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra did
<div n="lb"/>so and reached Pravarṣaṇagiri with money and gems so
<div n="lb"/>collected. There Garuḍa brought back to Kṛṣṇa his
<div n="lb"/>crown which had been, sometime back, stolen away by
<div n="lb"/>Bāṇāsura. Kṛṣṇa and Rāma returned to Mathurāpurī.
<div n="lb"/>Since Sṛgālavāsudeva had been killed by Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Rāma, Jarāsandha attacked Mathurāpurī again, for the
<div n="lb"/>eighteenth time. Though during all the wars Jarāsandha
<div n="lb"/>was defeated, by that time the Yādava power had been
<div n="lb"/>weakened much and so Kṛṣṇa ultimately decided to
<div n="lb"/>leave Mathurā and found another kingdom somewhere
<div n="lb"/>else. Kṛṣṇa had two reasons to come to this decision.
<div n="lb"/>Firstly, Jarāsandha was the father-in-law of his uncle
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa. Next, it was Jarāsandha's object to conquer
<div n="lb"/>Mathurāpurī for Kaṃsa's sons. Taking into considera-
<div n="lb"/>tion the above two objects of Jarāsandha, Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb"/>Rāma voluntarily quitted Mathurā with the Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>and went and lived in the city built for them by Viśva-
<div n="lb"/>karman on an island called Dvārakā in the western sea.
<div n="lb"/>(See under Kuśasthalī). (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Kṛṣṇa killed Kālayavana.%} King Kālayavana wanted
<div n="lb"/>to conquer Mathurāpurī for which purpose he performed
<div n="lb"/>penance and secured from Śiva the boon that none of
<div n="lb"/>the Yādavas would be able to kill him. Kṛṣṇa had
<div n="lb"/>shifted to Dvārakā, somewhat dejected by the thought
<div n="lb"/>that Kālayavana could not be killed because of the
<div n="lb"/>protection accorded by Śiva's boon.
<div n="NI"/>Another thing also happened at this juncture. King
<div n="lb"/>Mucukunda, son of Māndhātā had on the request of
<div n="lb"/>Indra gone to Devaloka and defeated the Asuras in
<div n="lb"/>war. Indra asked him to choose his reward for this
<div n="lb"/>service and Mucukunda wanted to be shown a place
<div n="lb"/>for him to sleep as he had not slept for a long time.
<div n="lb"/>Indra, accordingly showed him a cave on earth and
<div n="lb"/>told him that he who disturbed him in sleep would be
<div n="lb"/>reduced to ashes by his very look. Mucukunda went to
<div n="lb"/>sleep in that cave.
<div n="NI"/>Kālayavana approached Kṛṣṇa to kill him and the
<div n="lb"/>latter, pretending to be in fear of Kālayavana, ran
<div n="lb"/>before him. Kālayavana followed Kṛṣṇa, who entered
<div n="lb"/>the cave where Mucukunda was sleeping and he followed
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa into the cave also. Kālayavana, mistaking
<div n="lb"/>Mucukunda for Kṛṣṇa, kicked him violently whereupon
<div n="lb"/>he jumped up from sleep and looked at Kālayavana,
<div n="lb"/>who was reduced to ashes. Then Kṛṣṇa appeared before
<div n="lb"/>Mucukunda. who praised the former. On the advice of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa he performed penance at Badarikāśrama and
<div n="lb"/>attained salvation. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
[Page425-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa escaped from fire.%} Balabhadra and Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>started for Dvārakā carrying all the riches of Kālaya-
<div n="lb"/>vana. They met Jarāsandha on their way and took to
<div n="lb"/>their heels. Jarāsandha followed them to the heights of
<div n="lb"/>Mount Pravarṣaṇa where they disappeared. Jarāsandha
<div n="lb"/>set fire to the four sides of the mountain when Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛṣṇa escaped secretly from the fire to Dvārakā.
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha returned to Magadha believing that both
<div n="lb"/>his antagonists were burned to death. (Bhāgavata, 10th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Wedding of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Balabhadra-Revatī.%} Balabhadra married Revatī,
<div n="lb"/>daughter of King Ānarta of Kuśasthalī, former name
<div n="lb"/>of Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Kṛṣṇa-Rukmiṇī.%} King Bhīṣmaka of Vidarbha had
<div n="lb"/>five sons the eldest of whom was Rukmī. His sixth
<div n="lb"/>child was a daughter and she was named Rukmiṇī.
<div n="lb"/>Stories about Kṛṣṇa kindled in Rukmiṇī love for him.
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī, who hated Kṛṣṇa, wanted to give his sister in
<div n="lb"/>marriage to Śiśupāla. Rukmiṇī sent through a brahmin
<div n="lb"/>a message about the affair to Dvārakā. On the day of
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī's Svayaṃvara Rāma and Kṛṣṇa also went to
<div n="lb"/>Kuṇḍinapurī, capital of Vidarbha. and Kṛṣṇa. in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of all Kings, carried Rukmiṇī away in his
<div n="lb"/>chariot. The Kings who, under the leadership of
<div n="lb"/>Rukmī, attacked Kṛṣṇa were routed. A son called
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna was born to Kṛṣṇa by Rukmiṇī. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Kṛṣṇa-Jāmbavatī.%} Prasena, brother of the Yādava
<div n="lb"/>King Satrājit, went ahunting wearing on him the gem
<div n="lb"/>called Syamantaka presented to the latter by the Sun-
<div n="lb"/>god. Jāmbavān saw a lion carrying off the gem after
<div n="lb"/>killing Prasena. He killed the lion, recovered the gem
<div n="lb"/>from it and gave it to his children to play with. A
<div n="lb"/>rumour was spread that it was Kṛṣṇa who had killed
<div n="lb"/>and stolen the gem. Kṛṣṇa searched for the gem in the
<div n="lb"/>forest and found it out in the cave of Jāmbavān. In
<div n="lb"/>the duel that ensued between Jāmbavān and Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>the former was defeated. He recognised Kṛṣṇa to be
<div n="lb"/>the Lord, and presented Syamantaka and also his
<div n="lb"/>daughter Jāmbavatī to Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavatī thus
<div n="lb"/>became Kṛṣṇa's wife. (See under Syamantaka).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Satyabhāmā.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa returned Syaman-
<div n="lb"/>taka to Satrājit and he, in return, gave his daughter
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā in marriage to Kṛṣṇa. Though Syaman-
<div n="lb"/>taka was given to Kṛṣṇa by way of dowry he did not
<div n="lb"/>accept it. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Kālindī.%} The happy news that the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb"/>vas had escaped from the lac palace and were living at
<div n="lb"/>Khāṇḍavaprastha took some time to reach Kṛṣṇa, who
<div n="lb"/>had been pained to know that they were burned to
<div n="lb"/>death in the palace. As soon as Kṛṣṇa knew that the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas were safe at Khāṇḍavaprastha he went to
<div n="lb"/>them along with Yādava chiefs like Sātyaki and others.
<div n="lb"/>It was then that the fire-god Vahni, requested Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>for the Khāṇḍava forest for his food and Arjuna con-
<div n="lb"/>sented to it. It was Kṛṣṇa who drove Arjuna's chariot
<div n="lb"/>in his fight with Indra at the burning of the forest by
<div n="lb"/>Agnideva. (See under Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna saved
<div n="lb"/>Maya from the Khāṇḍava fire and Maya, in return for
<div n="lb"/>the kindness, built a palace for the Pāṇḍavas at Indra-
<div n="lb"/>prastha. Kṛṣṇa also lived there for a few days. One
<div n="lb"/>day while Kṛṣṇa was strolling on the banks of the
<div n="lb"/>Kālindī in the company of Arjuna they saw a woman,
<div n="lb"/>who told them that her name was Kālindī and that
[Page426-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>she would marry none but Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa then took her
<div n="lb"/>as his wife. (See under Kālindī). After staying at
<div n="lb"/>Indraprastha for three or four months Kṛṣṇa returned
<div n="lb"/>to Dvārakā with Kālindī. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Mitravindā.%} The King of Avantī had
<div n="lb"/>married Rājādhidevī, sister of Kṛṣṇa's father and they
<div n="lb"/>had two sons called Vinda and Anuvinda and a
<div n="lb"/>daughter Mitravindā, who had fixed in her mind
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa as her husband. Kṛṣṇa, who was present at her
<div n="lb"/>Svayaṃvara carried her off on his chariot to Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Satyā.%} King Nagnajit of Kosala, father of
<div n="lb"/>Satyā, had seven oxen like elephants in strength. The
<div n="lb"/>King proclaimed that his daughter would be married
<div n="lb"/>to the person who would tie down the oxen. Various
<div n="lb"/>Kings attempted the task but failed. Ultimately
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa went to Kosala and Kṛṣṇa assumed
<div n="lb"/>seven forms and tied down the oxen with cords. The
<div n="lb"/>seven oxen at once fell down. Kṛṣṇa took Satyā for his
<div n="lb"/>wife.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Kaikeyī (Bhadrā).%} Kṛṣṇa married
<div n="lb"/>Kaikeyī, the daughter of Śrutakīrti, sister of Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>father.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Lakṣmaṇā.%} Lakṣmaṇā, daughter of King
<div n="lb"/>of Madra chose Kṛṣṇa at her Svayaṃvara and she
<div n="lb"/>became Kṛṣṇa's wife.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Kṛṣṇa-16000 women.%} Brahmā had given the boon
<div n="lb"/>to the 16000 daughters of Narakāsura in their previous
<div n="lb"/>birth that Viṣṇu would marry them in their next birth.
<div n="lb"/>While even the Devas were suffering on account of
<div n="lb"/>Narakāsura, Śrī Kṛṣṇa along with Satyabhāmā mounted
<div n="lb"/>Garuḍa, went to Prāgjyotiṣa, the kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Narakāsura, defeated him in fight and released his
<div n="lb"/>16000 daughters from captivity. He returned with
<div n="lb"/>them to Dvārakā, assumed the guise of 16000 men and
<div n="lb"/>married those 16000 girls. He built a palace for each
<div n="lb"/>of his 16000 wives. (For details see under Narakāsura).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Kṛṣṇa's%} 16008 {%wives.%} The eight women, i.e.
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī, Jāmbavatī, Satyabhāmā, Kālindī, Mitra-
<div n="lb"/>vindā, Satyā, Kaikeyī (Bhadrā) Lakṣmaṇā and the 16000
<div n="lb"/>daughters of Narakāsura constituted Kṛṣṇa's harem.
<div n="lb"/>(The 16000 daughters of Narakāsura are not mentioned
<div n="lb"/>by name in the Purāṇas). (See under Sudattā and
<div n="lb"/>Ketumān IV.)
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Gave Salvation to Ghaṇṭākarṇas.%} Ghaṇṭa and
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa were two demon brothers. Kṛṣṇa met them at
<div n="lb"/>Badarikāśrama where he had gone after his marriage
<div n="lb"/>with Rukmiṇī, to perform penance to Śiva for a child.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa offered salvation to the two demon brothers,
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṇṭa and Karṇa.
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Fight between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna.%} (See under Gālava).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Killed Murāsura.%} (See under Mura).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%Killed Narakāsura.%} (See under Naraka).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%Plucked away Pārijāta.%} During the period when
<div n="lb"/>Narakāsura was having his own ways on the earth and
<div n="lb"/>when he took away by force Indra's royal umbrella
<div n="lb"/>and the ear-rings of Aditi, the Devamātā, Indra sought
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's help to suppress the Asura. Kṛṣṇa along with
<div n="lb"/>Satyabhāmā, mounted Garuḍa, went and killed the
<div n="lb"/>Asura and restored the royal umbrella to Indra and
<div n="lb"/>the ear-rings to Aditi. On their way back home Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>as desired by Satyabhāmā, plucked by its roots the
<div n="lb"/>Pārijāta from Devaloka at which Indra fought Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb"/>but got defeated. The Pārijāta was brought to Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>and planted in front of Satyabhāmā's palace. It is
<div n="lb"/>stated that Pārijāta was thus brought and planted by
[Page426-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa to alleviate the grief caused to Satyabhāmā by
<div n="lb"/>the return by Kṛṣṇa of Syamantaka to Satrājit.
<div n="lb"/>(Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Kṛṣṇa's sons and grand-children.%} Ten sons were born
<div n="lb"/>to each of the eight chief wives—from Rukmiṇī to
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇā—of Kṛṣṇa. Names of the chief among
<div n="lb"/>those eighty sons are given below.

<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Of Bhadrā—%} Saṅgrāmacitta.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Of Lakṣmaṇā—%} Praghoṣa.
<div n="NI"/>A daughter called Rukmāvatī was born to Rukmī,
<div n="lb"/>brother of Rukmiṇī. Pradyumna married Rukmāvatī
<div n="lb"/>and Aniruddha was their son. It was this Aniruddha,
<div n="lb"/>who wedded Uṣā. Cārumatī, the daughter of Rukmiṇī
<div n="lb"/>was married by the son of Kṛtavarman (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Kṛṣṇa tested Rukmiṇī%} While Śrī Kṛṣṇa was once
<div n="lb"/>having a chat with Rukmiṇī he wanted to test her
<div n="lb"/>love for him. So he told her that he was penniless and
<div n="lb"/>helpless and was hiding from his enemies there at
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā and that he would only be really glad if she
<div n="lb"/>married some other powerful King. Kṛṣṇa had not
<div n="lb"/>completed his sentences when Rukmiṇī fell down
<div n="lb"/>unconscious. Kṛṣṇa then consoled her. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Kṛṣṇa fought with Bāṇa.%} See under Bāṇa
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Kṛṣṇa killed Pauṇḍraka.%} See under Pauṇḍraka.

<div n="NI"/>27) {%Śrīkṛṣṇa blessed Pāñcālī at the time of her Svayaṃvara%}
<div n="lb"/>(See under Pāñcālī).
<div n="NI"/>28) {%Subhadrā given in marriage to Arjuna.%} Arjuna had
<div n="lb"/>to go on a pilgrimage for one year as atonement for
<div n="lb"/>having got into the palace where Yudhiṣṭhira was
<div n="lb"/>spending the days with Pāñcālī. It was during this
<div n="lb"/>period of his pilgrimage that Arjuna married Subhadrā,
<div n="lb"/>who was the younger sister of Kṛṣṇa due to whose
<div n="lb"/>cleverness alone Arjuna got her as his wife. (For
<div n="lb"/>details see under Subhadrā).
<div n="NI"/>29) {%Kṛṣṇa got the club called Kaumodakī and he saved Maya.%}
<div n="lb"/>See under Khāṇḍavadāha.
<div n="NI"/>30) {%Kṛṣṇa with the Pāṇḍavas.%} The rest of Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>life was intimately connected with the history of the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. Important roles played by Kṛṣṇa during
<div n="lb"/>the period up to the great war, are summarised below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) He conducted Yajña continuously for many years
<div n="lb"/>for the protection of Dharma (righteousness). (Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Permitted Yudhiṣṭhira to perform Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>yajña. (Chapter 14, Sabhā Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Along with Bhīma and Arjuna, he went to
<div n="lb"/>Mathurā in the guise of a brahmin and killed Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha. (See under Jarāsandha).
<div n="NI"/>(4) He crowned Sahadeva, son of Jarāsandha, as
<div n="lb"/>King of Mathurā. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 24, Verse 43).
<div n="NI"/>(5) He gave a lot of money as donation at the
[Page427-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya Yajña of Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>33, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(6) He was presented with ear-rings by Bhūmidevī
<div n="lb"/>(goddess Earth). (Sabhā Parva, Page 808, Southern
<div n="lb"/>text).
<div n="NI"/>(7) He killed Śiśupāla. (See under Śiśupāla).
<div n="NI"/>(8) He made the clothes of Pāñcālī unending when
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana tried to strip her naked in the royal
<div n="lb"/>assembly. (See under Pāñcālī).
<div n="NI"/>(9) He fought Sālva and Saubha. (See under Sālva
<div n="lb"/>and Saubha).
<div n="NI"/>(10) He once took Subhadrā and Arjuna to Dvārakā.
<div n="lb"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 22; Verses 47, 48).
<div n="NI"/>(11) He consoled the Pāṇḍavas at the Kāmyaka
<div n="lb"/>forest. (Vana Parva, Chapter 183, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(12) He ate the bit of a leaf of greens from Pāñcālī's
<div n="lb"/>vessel and was pleased with her. (See under Pāñcālī).
<div n="NI"/>(13) Attended the wedding of Abhimanyu at
<div n="lb"/>Upaplavyanagara and gave a lot of money to Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra. (Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 72, Verse 24).
<div n="NI"/>(14) He sent to the court of King Virāṭa a messenger,
<div n="lb"/>who explained to him the corrupt ways of the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas and the righteousness of the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="lb"/>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>31) {%Tested by Nārada.%} Nārada wanted to know how
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa managed to satisfy all his 16008 wives. For
<div n="lb"/>this purpose he visited their houses and Nārada was
<div n="lb"/>wonder-struck to find Kṛṣṇa engaged in conversation
<div n="lb"/>with his wives in all the houses he visited. (Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>32) {%Kṛṣṇa blessed Kucela.%} See under Kucela.
<div n="NI"/>33) {%The story of Santānagopālam.%} See para 7 (d) under
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>34) {%Kṛṣṇa feigned sleep.%} The Kauravas refused to part
<div n="lb"/>with half the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas, who had
<div n="lb"/>returned from their exile in the forest. Both the
<div n="lb"/>sides began preparations for war. Duryodhana went to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā to invite Kṛṣṇa to his side, and seeing him
<div n="lb"/>at a distance Kṛṣṇa feigned sleep and lay down there.
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana occupied a stool at the head of Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb"/>bed. Arjuna, who also came to seek his help, stood
<div n="lb"/>with folded hands at Kṛṣṇa's feet. It was Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>whom Kṛṣṇa first saw on waking up. But Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>told him that it was he who had come first. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>was in a fix, and he had to promise to help both the
<div n="lb"/>sides. He promised his entire army to one side and his
<div n="lb"/>personal help, himself without any weapons with him,
<div n="lb"/>to the other side, and Arjuna was asked to make his
<div n="lb"/>choice first as he was younger than Duryodhana.
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna chose Kṛṣṇa without arms and Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>with his infantry. Kṛṣṇa agreed to act as Arjuna's
<div n="lb"/>charioteer.
<div n="NI"/>35) {%As messenger of peace in Kaurava assembly.%} Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>putra requested Kṛṣṇa to find out means to avoid war
<div n="lb"/>somehow or other and Kṛṣṇa sent a message to Dhṛtarā-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭra through Sañjaya but nothing came out of it. Ultima-
<div n="lb"/>tely Kṛṣṇa himself decided to visit the Kauravas for which
<div n="lb"/>purpose he went first to Dvārakā in his chariot with
<div n="lb"/>Sātyaki. On his way Kṛṣṇa held talks with many a
<div n="lb"/>great sage. From Dvārakā he returned to Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>where he visited and consoled Kuntī at Vidura's house.
<div n="lb"/>He had his supper also there. The next day he attended
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana's court and strongly pleaded for the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. But Duryodhana and others ridiculed him
<div n="lb"/>and even attempted to take him captive. Śrī Kṛṣṇa at
[Page427-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>once exhibited his Viśva-rūpa (Cosmic form). The
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas were frightened to witness Brahmā on
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's forehead, Śiva on his chest, Āditya-Vasu-
<div n="lb"/>Rudras in his mouth etc. Śrī Kṛṣṇa granted the blind
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra divine eyes to see this Viśvarūpa and he
<div n="lb"/>sang the praise of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa returned to the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas after advising Karṇa to fight on the Pāṇḍava
<div n="lb"/>side in the impending war. (Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>36) {%Kṛṣṇa in the great war.%} The parts Kṛṣṇa played
<div n="lb"/>during the Kuru-Pāṇḍava war are briefly given below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) The Kaurava and the Pāṇḍava armies were gather-
<div n="lb"/>ed at Kurukṣetra in full battle array and Arjuna, at
<div n="lb"/>the sight of the thousands of relations in the opposite
<div n="lb"/>camp, became a prey to a great delusion and sat down.
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa then enthused him to fight by giving him
<div n="lb"/>advice, which came later to be known as the great
<div n="lb"/>Gītā. The Gītā contains the Sāṅkhya, Yoga, the
<div n="lb"/>characteristics of the wise people and the unwise, des-
<div n="lb"/>cription about yajñas, greatness of knowledge, chara-
<div n="lb"/>cteristics of Sāṃkhya and niṣkāmakarma, yogins,
<div n="lb"/>jñānayoga etc. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapters 26-42).
<div n="NI"/>(2) At the commencement of the battle, Kṛṣṇa blew
<div n="lb"/>aloud his conch Pāñcajanya. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>25, Verse 15).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Kṛṣṇa rushed forward with his Cakrāyudha to
<div n="lb"/>kill Bhīṣma, who then praised Kṛṣṇa. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>(4) He prompted Arjuna to kill Bhīṣma. (Bhīṣma Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 106, Verse 33).
<div n="NI"/>(5) He received on his chest the Vaiṣṇavāstra shot by
<div n="lb"/>Bhagadatta against Arjuna. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 29,
<div n="lb"/>Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Consoled Arjuna, who was lamenting over the
<div n="lb"/>death of Abhimanyu. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 72).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Consoled Subhadrā, who was sunk in sorrow at
<div n="lb"/>the loss of her son. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 77).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Consoled the crying Pāñcālī and Uttarā. (Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 78).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Took Arjuna in a dream to Śiva and got Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>blessing for him. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 80).
<div n="NI"/>(10) He looked after the horses in the battle-field.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Prompted Arjuna to kill Duryodhana. (Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 102).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Kṛṣṇa created illusory darkness and prompted
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna to kill Jayadratha. (See under Jayadratha).
<div n="NI"/>(13) He lifted the darkness after Jayadratha was killed
<div n="lb"/>by Arjuna. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 146).
<div n="NI"/>(14) As it was not proper for Arjuna and Karṇa to be
<div n="lb"/>fighting with each other at mid-night he deputed
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca to fight Karṇa. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>173).
<div n="NI"/>(15) He consoled Dharmaputra, who was grieving
<div n="lb"/>over the death of Ghaṭotkaca. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>153).
<div n="NI"/>(16) He prompted Arjuna to kill Karṇa. (Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 60).
<div n="NI"/>(17) Withdrew Arjuna from confrontation with Karṇa
<div n="lb"/>on the pretext of attending to Dharmaputra, who had
<div n="lb"/>been wounded. (Karṇa Parva, Chapter 64).
<div n="NI"/>(18) A sudden dispute arose between Dharmaputra and
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna, who drew his sword to kill the former. And
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa reconciled them by relating the story of Vyādha
<div n="lb"/>and Kauśika (For the story see under Valāka).
[Page428-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(19) Arjuna got ready to commit suicide: Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>dissuaded him from the attempt. (Karṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 70).
<div n="NI"/>(20) Kṛṣṇa again prompted Arjuna to kill Karṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(21) In the fierce battle that ensued between Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>and Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa pressed down the platform of the
<div n="lb"/>chariot when the latter shot the nāgāstra (the serpent
<div n="lb"/>arrow). The arrow flew off with Arjuna's crown.
<div n="lb"/>(Karṇa Parva, Chapter 90).
<div n="NI"/>(22) Arjuna killed Karṇa after which Kṛṣṇa prompted
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaputra to kill Śalya. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>(23) Kṛṣṇa prompted Bhīma to kill Duryodhana in an
<div n="lb"/>illusory battle. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>(24) As requested by Yudhiṣṭhira Kṛṣṇa left the
<div n="lb"/>battle-field for Hastināpura and returned after con-
<div n="lb"/>soling Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī. (Śalya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 62).
<div n="NI"/>(25) Kṛṣṇa cursed Aśvatthāmā who released arrows
<div n="lb"/>against pregnant women. (See under Aśvatthāmā).
<div n="NI"/>(26) Asked Bhīṣma to instruct Yudhiṣṭhira on dharma
<div n="lb"/>(righteousness). (Śānti Parva, Chapter 51).
<div n="NI"/>(27) He granted the boon to Bhīṣma lying on the bed of
<div n="lb"/>arrows that he would not feel hunger and thirst and
<div n="lb"/>that his intellect would function powerfully as long as
<div n="lb"/>he was discoursing on dharma. (Śānti Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>52).
<div n="NI"/>(28) He related to Arjuna the root meaning of his
<div n="lb"/>various names. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 341).
<div n="NI"/>(29) He explained to sages and Bhūmidevī some pro-
<div n="lb"/>found doctrines about God and the world. (Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 167).
<div n="NI"/>(30) He gave permission to Bhīṣma to die. (Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 167).
<div n="NI"/>(31) Consoled Gaṅgādevī who grieved over the death
<div n="lb"/>of Bhīṣma. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 168).
<div n="NI"/>(32) He once again revealed the doctrine of the Gītā
<div n="lb"/>in the form of discussions between Siddhamaharṣis and
<div n="lb"/>Kaśyapa. (Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 16).
<div n="NI"/>(33) After the great war was over he went to Dvārakā
<div n="lb"/>with Subhadrā and Sātyaki with the consent of Yudhiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṭhira. (Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 57, Verses 54-58).
<div n="NI"/>37) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa again at Dvārakā.%} When Kṛṣṇa returned to
<div n="lb"/>Dvārakā, Sage Uttaṅka visited him. The sage was told
<div n="lb"/>details about the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas by Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>He detailed to the sage spiritual principles too and
<div n="lb"/>showed him his Viśvarūpa (Cosmic form). Kṛṣṇa parti-
<div n="lb"/>cipated in festival held by the Yādavas on the Raivata
<div n="lb"/>mountain. Afterwards when he went to Dvārakā he
<div n="lb"/>told his father Vasudeva details about the war. He him-
<div n="lb"/>self performed the obsequies of Abhimanyu. (Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(38) {%Killed Haṃsaḍibhakas.%} See under Ḍibhaka.
<div n="NI"/>(39) {%Kṛṣṇa brought back Parīkṣit to life.%} Kṛṣṇa again
<div n="lb"/>went to Hastināpura. There Uttarā, wife of Abhimanyu,
<div n="lb"/>delivered, but the child was born dead as the arrow
<div n="lb"/>of Aśvatthāmā had hit her womb. Kṛṣṇa brought the
<div n="lb"/>dead child back to life on the request of Kuntī. It was
<div n="lb"/>this child, who became later famous as Parīkṣit. (Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha Parva, Chapter 66).
<div n="NI"/>(40) {%The evening of Kṛṣṇa's life.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%The curse of Gāndhārī.%} Most of the heroes and
<div n="lb"/>distinguished archers like Duryodhana had been killed
<div n="lb"/>in the great war, and Gāndhārī overwhelmed with grief
<div n="lb"/>and anger at the death of her sons lamented over them
[Page428-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>loudly. She realised that Kṛṣṇa was the cause of all
<div n="lb"/>the destruction and cursed him as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>“If I have gained any powers by my loyal and devout
<div n="lb"/>service to my husband, O! Kṛṣṇa I curse you on the
<div n="lb"/>strength of that power. Since you forsook relations like
<div n="lb"/>the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas who quarrelled with
<div n="lb"/>each other, you also will have to witness the killing of
<div n="lb"/>relations. Thirtysix years from today your relations,
<div n="lb"/>ministers and sons will be killed, and you too will be
<div n="lb"/>killed by a hunter in the forest. Your women-folk also
<div n="lb"/>will cry as we women cry now.” (Strī Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>25).
<div n="NI"/>The curse of Gāndhārī that the Yādava dynasty would
<div n="lb"/>be annihilated after thirtysix years was fulfilled. In the
<div n="lb"/>thirty-sixth year another curse also befell the dynasty
<div n="lb"/>which contributed further to its annihilation.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Curse of the sages.%} The sages Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva
<div n="lb"/>and Nārada came to Dvārakā once. Some Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>brought Sāmba dressed as a pregnant woman before the
<div n="lb"/>sages and asked them derisively what child, whether
<div n="lb"/>male or female, would Sāmba give birth to. Angry at
<div n="lb"/>this insult, the sages said that the ‘pregnant woman’
<div n="lb"/>would deliver an iron rod, which would become instru-
<div n="lb"/>mental for the destruction of the Yādava dynasty. Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>who was told about the curse said that it was as it was
<div n="lb"/>destined to be. Next day Sāmba delivered an iron rod.
<div n="lb"/>The Yādavas filed it into powder and threw the
<div n="lb"/>powder into the sea. Śrī Kṛṣṇa enforced prohibition of
<div n="lb"/>liquors in Dvārakā with the object of avoiding any
<div n="lb"/>untoward incidents in Dvārakā. It was declared that
<div n="lb"/>those who produced liquor would be hanged to death
<div n="lb"/>along with their families. (Mausala Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Evil omens.%} Signs of the destruction of the Yādavas
<div n="lb"/>began appearing. Agents of Kāla visited house after
<div n="lb"/>house. Rats multiplied in numbers everywhere in the
<div n="lb"/>land, and they began gnawing the nails and hairs of
<div n="lb"/>people enjoying sleep. Sheep howled like jackals. Asses
<div n="lb"/>were born from cows and cats from mules. Dogs coha-
<div n="lb"/>bited with rats. The Cakrāyudha (Discus) given to
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa by Agnideva at the time of Khāṇḍavadāha dis-
<div n="lb"/>appeared into the sky while the Yādavas were looking
<div n="lb"/>on. Thus symptoms of an all-round destruction were
<div n="lb"/>witnessed.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Destruction of the rādavas.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Balabhadra,
<div n="lb"/>Uddhava and others were about to go on a pilgrimage,
<div n="lb"/>and the Yadus, the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas began
<div n="lb"/>manufacturing and drinking liquor. They also began to
<div n="lb"/>quarrel with one another. The powder of the iron rod
<div n="lb"/>thrown into the sea was washed ashore and it grew up
<div n="lb"/>like arrow-like grass. The Yādavas fought with one
<div n="lb"/>another and many were killed. Kṛṣṇa got terribly angry
<div n="lb"/>at the death of Sātyaki, Pradyumna and others. He
<div n="lb"/>plucked a handful of grass and it transformed itself into
<div n="lb"/>an iron rod with which he beat to death those around
<div n="lb"/>him. Then all the people plucked up the grass which
<div n="lb"/>turned into iron rods. They fought amongst themselves
<div n="lb"/>with the iron rods and all of them got killed.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Death of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.%} During this period Bala-
<div n="lb"/>bhadra went and seated himself under a tree in deep
<div n="lb"/>meditation. Kṛṣṇa stood near him. Dāruka and Babhru
<div n="lb"/>also arrived there. Kṛṣṇa deputed Dāruka to Hastinā-
<div n="lb"/>pura to inform Arjuna about the annihilation of the
<div n="lb"/>Yādava race. Then Kṛṣṇa went to the palace and con-
<div n="lb"/>soled the women-folk there. When he told them that
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna would come and take care of them, his wives
[Page429-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>shed tears. Kṛṣṇa then took leave of Vasudeva and
<div n="lb"/>returned to Balabhadra. Kṛṣṇa saw even at a distance
<div n="lb"/>a white serpent coming out of Balabhadra's mouth
<div n="lb"/>and moving away to Pātāla through the sea. The ser-
<div n="lb"/>pent which was the soul of Balabhadra was duly receiv-
<div n="lb"/>ed by the prominent Nāgas in Pātāla. Kṛṣṇa roamed
<div n="lb"/>about the forest for some time and then lay down on
<div n="lb"/>the ground immersed in Yoga with his feet raised up.
<div n="lb"/>An Asura called Jara, who saw Kṛṣṇa's raised feet from
<div n="lb"/>a distance mistook the same for a deer and shot it with
<div n="lb"/>his arrows. Kṛṣṇa expired at once and rose up in the
<div n="lb"/>guise of Viṣṇu to Vaikuṇṭha. (Mausala Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Reason for Kṛṣṇa's foot being hit by arrow.%} Durvāsas
<div n="lb"/>once went to Dvārakā and enquired who was there to
<div n="lb"/>put him up as a guest. Kṛṣṇa invited him to his palace
<div n="lb"/>and treated him as a very honoured guest. He began
<div n="lb"/>creating trouble there by breaking vessels, eating only
<div n="lb"/>very sparsely at times but eating all that he saw at
<div n="lb"/>other times. Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī put up with the
<div n="lb"/>vagaries of the sage quite patiently. One day the sage
<div n="lb"/>expressed a desire to taste pudding, and accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī cooked it and served it to the sage.
<div n="lb"/>After tasting some pudding he asked Kṛṣṇa to smear
<div n="lb"/>his whole body with the balance of it and Kṛṣṇa did so
<div n="lb"/>except the bottom of his feet. The sage asked him why
<div n="lb"/>he did not smear the nether surface of his feet with
<div n="lb"/>the pudding to which Kṛṣṇa humbly answered that he
<div n="lb"/>did not like doing so. Durvāsas smeared Rukmiṇī's
<div n="lb"/>body with what remained of the pudding. He yoked
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī to the chariot and rode off swiftly in it. On
<div n="lb"/>the way he whipped Rukmiṇī. Kṛṣṇa ran after the
<div n="lb"/>chariot so that he might be of service to the sage.
<div n="lb"/>After he had gone some distance the sage jumped out
<div n="lb"/>of the chariot and ran through the forest. Ultimately
<div n="lb"/>he turned round to Kṛṣṇa and told him as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>“Oh! Kṛṣṇa! I am pleased with your service. Let
<div n="lb"/>Rukmiṇī have the first place among your wives. She will
<div n="lb"/>not be affected by old age. And, you will never meet
<div n="lb"/>with death by being hit at those parts of your body
<div n="lb"/>which have been smeared with the pudding.”
<div n="NI"/>When Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī returned to the palace the
<div n="lb"/>vessels which Durvāsas had broken were found to be
<div n="lb"/>in a more glittering condition than of old. Their welfare
<div n="lb"/>and happiness were also increased. Kṛṣṇa died hit by
<div n="lb"/>the arrow of the hunter on the lower surface of his feet
<div n="lb"/>as he had not smeared that part of the body with the
<div n="lb"/>pudding left over by Durvāsas. (Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 159), (There is another story to the effect that
<div n="lb"/>Jara, the hunter, was Bāli (whom Śrī Rāma had killed)
<div n="lb"/>reborn, and he killed Kṛṣṇa in retaliation for his former
<div n="lb"/>death).
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%After Kṛṣṇa's death.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Arjuna came to Dvārakā and cremated Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="lb"/>(Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 31).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) After his death Kṛṣṇa, lives in the guise of Nārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa in the divine sphere. (Svargārohaṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5, Verses 24-26).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Anointed queens like Rukmiṇī and Jāmbavatī
<div n="lb"/>and some other wives of Kṛṣṇa entered his funeral
<div n="lb"/>pyre and ended their lives. (Mausala Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>7, Verses 73 and 74).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) While Arjuna was leading the remaining wives of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa away from Dvārakā forest-dwellers attacked
<div n="lb"/>them on the way. But the women, to escape from their
[Page429-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>clutches, ran off and jumped into the river Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>and died in its waters. Their souls entered heaven
<div n="lb"/>(Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 25).
