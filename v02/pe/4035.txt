MADANAMĀLĀ¦. A celebrated prostitute of the city of
Pratiṣṭhāna. Narasiṃha, King of Pratiṣṭhāna, did not
surrender himself to Vikramāditya, emperor of
Pāṭalīputra. The resourceful Vikramāditya went to
Pratiṣṭhāna and caught hold of the prostitute Madana-
mālā first and then through her subdued the King
Narasiṃha. After that Vikramāditya took Madana-
mālā to his place and made her stay there. (Taraṅga
