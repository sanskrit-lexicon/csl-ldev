MITRAVINDĀ¦. Daughter of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's father's sister.
Mitravindā's mother's name was Rājādhidevī. Rājādhi-
devī, queen of Avantī, got three children named Vinda,
Anuvinda and Mitravindā. In the Svayaṃvara Mitra-
vindā chose Kṛṣṇa as her husband. Vinda and
Anuvinda did not like it and joining the Kaurava side
fought against Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa defeated them all and
took Mitravindā to Dvārakā. (10th Skandha, Bhāga-
