AṢṬAKA II¦. A Rājarṣi born to Viśvāmitra of Mādhavī,
<div n="lb"/>wife of Yayāti. (Śloka 18, Chapter 119, Udyoga Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.). See under Gālava.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How Aṣṭaka went to heaven.%} This story was told to
<div n="lb"/>the Pāṇḍavas by the sage Mārkaṇḍeya.
<div n="NI"/>“Aṣṭaka, son of Viśvāmitra, performed an Aśvamedha
<div n="lb"/>Yāga. All the kings took part in this. Pratardana,
<div n="lb"/>Vasumanas and Auśīnara Śibi, and all the brothers of
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭaka attended the function. After the yāga Aṣṭaka
<div n="lb"/>took his three brothers for an air travel and on the way
<div n="lb"/>met the great sage Nārada. Nārada was also taken in
<div n="lb"/>and as they continued their flight, Aṣṭaka asked Nārada
<div n="lb"/>who should step down from the aeroplane if only four
<div n="lb"/>were allowed to go to heaven. “Aṣṭaka”, replied Nārada
<div n="lb"/>and explained the reason also. Once when Nārada
<div n="lb"/>stayed at the āśrama of Aṣṭaka the former found many
<div n="lb"/>varieties of cows there and asked Aṣṭaka whose they
<div n="lb"/>were. Then in self praise Aṣṭaka had said that all
<div n="lb"/>those were cows which he had given away as gifts.
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭaka then asked who should get down if only three
<div n="lb"/>were allowed to go to heaven. ‘Pratardana’, said
<div n="lb"/>Nārada and explained the reason. Once when
<div n="lb"/>Pratardana was taking Nārada in the former's chariot
<div n="lb"/>four brahmins one behind the other approached him
<div n="lb"/>and begged for a horse each. When Pratardana asked
<div n="lb"/>for some time the brahmins were not prepared to wait
<div n="lb"/>and so he gave all but one of his four horses and asked
<div n="lb"/>the fourth to wait. As he was also found to be persistent
<div n="lb"/>he gave the one drawing his chariot also and dragged the
<div n="lb"/>chariot himself but abusing the brahmins all the way. It
<div n="lb"/>was that abuse that gave him the slur. Then Aṣṭaka asked
[Page063-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Nārada who should get down if only two were permitted to
<div n="lb"/>enter heaven. ‘Vasumanas’, said Nārada and explained
<div n="lb"/>the reason. Nārada went to the house of Vasumanas
<div n="lb"/>three times and each time the latter spoke highly of his
<div n="lb"/>chariot. Nārada also joined in praising his flower-cha-
<div n="lb"/>riot and the brahmins present there also followed suit.
<div n="lb"/>Pleased at this Vasumanas became proud of his possession
<div n="lb"/>and his vainglorious talks made him unfit. Then Aṣṭaka
<div n="lb"/>asked if only one were allowed to go to heaven who
<div n="lb"/>should go. ‘Śibi’, said Nārada immediately. Even Nārada
<div n="lb"/>would be only next to Śibi and Nārada explained the
<div n="lb"/>reason thus. Once a brahmin went to Śibi for food. Śibi
<div n="lb"/>asked him what food he relished most and the brahmin
<div n="lb"/>said that he would like to have the fresh flesh of Śibi's
<div n="lb"/>only son, Bṛhadgarbha. Without even the slightest hesi-
<div n="lb"/>tation Śibi killed his son and cooked his flesh and when
<div n="lb"/>the food was ready he went out to invite the brahmin.
<div n="lb"/>But on going out the King saw the brahmin setting
<div n="lb"/>fire to his palace, treasury, armoury, stables, harem and
<div n="lb"/>elephant-sheds. Without even a quiver on his face, the
<div n="lb"/>king respectfully took the brahmin inside and gave him
<div n="lb"/>food. The brahmin was amazed at the patience of the
<div n="lb"/>King and sitting before his food for some time told the
<div n="lb"/>King that he would be satisfied if the King himself ate
<div n="lb"/>that food. Respecting the request the King was about to
<div n="lb"/>eat the flesh of his own son when the brahmin who was
<div n="lb"/>none other than Brahmā in disguise praised him for
<div n="lb"/>his devotion and gave him back his son adorned with
<div n="lb"/>sweet smelling flowers and disappeared blessing them.
<div n="lb"/>When his ministers questioned him about this Śibi said,
<div n="lb"/>“I do not give for a name or fame. Neither do I give
<div n="lb"/>for wealth and happiness. I do it because it is the only
<div n="lb"/>way to be rid of sins”. (Chapter 168, Araṇya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other details.%} (1) Aṣṭaka was a Rājarṣi. (Śloka 5,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 86, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Aṣṭaka gave away all the puṇya (goodness) he
<div n="lb"/>earned to Yayāti. See under Yayāti. (Ślokas 13 & 14,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 122, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
