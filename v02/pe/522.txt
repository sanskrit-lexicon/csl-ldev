AṢṬAKA II¦. A Rājarṣi born to Viśvāmitra of Mādhavī,
wife of Yayāti. (Śloka 18, Chapter 119, Udyoga Parva,
M.B.). See under Gālava.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How Aṣṭaka went to heaven.%} This story was told to
the Pāṇḍavas by the sage Mārkaṇḍeya.
<div n="NI"/>“Aṣṭaka, son of Viśvāmitra, performed an Aśvamedha
Yāga. All the kings took part in this. Pratardana,
Vasumanas and Auśīnara Śibi, and all the brothers of
Aṣṭaka attended the function. After the yāga Aṣṭaka
took his three brothers for an air travel and on the way
met the great sage Nārada. Nārada was also taken in
and as they continued their flight, Aṣṭaka asked Nārada
who should step down from the aeroplane if only four
were allowed to go to heaven. “Aṣṭaka”, replied Nārada
and explained the reason also. Once when Nārada
stayed at the āśrama of Aṣṭaka the former found many
varieties of cows there and asked Aṣṭaka whose they
were. Then in self praise Aṣṭaka had said that all
those were cows which he had given away as gifts.
Aṣṭaka then asked who should get down if only three
were allowed to go to heaven. ‘Pratardana’, said
Nārada and explained the reason. Once when
Pratardana was taking Nārada in the former's chariot
four brahmins one behind the other approached him
and begged for a horse each. When Pratardana asked
for some time the brahmins were not prepared to wait
and so he gave all but one of his four horses and asked
the fourth to wait. As he was also found to be persistent
he gave the one drawing his chariot also and dragged the
chariot himself but abusing the brahmins all the way. It
was that abuse that gave him the slur. Then Aṣṭaka asked
[Page063-b+ 65]
Nārada who should get down if only two were permitted to
enter heaven. ‘Vasumanas’, said Nārada and explained
the reason. Nārada went to the house of Vasumanas
three times and each time the latter spoke highly of his
chariot. Nārada also joined in praising his flower-cha-
riot and the brahmins present there also followed suit.
Pleased at this Vasumanas became proud of his possession
and his vainglorious talks made him unfit. Then Aṣṭaka
asked if only one were allowed to go to heaven who
should go. ‘Śibi’, said Nārada immediately. Even Nārada
would be only next to Śibi and Nārada explained the
reason thus. Once a brahmin went to Śibi for food. Śibi
asked him what food he relished most and the brahmin
said that he would like to have the fresh flesh of Śibi's
only son, Bṛhadgarbha. Without even the slightest hesi-
tation Śibi killed his son and cooked his flesh and when
the food was ready he went out to invite the brahmin.
But on going out the King saw the brahmin setting
fire to his palace, treasury, armoury, stables, harem and
elephant-sheds. Without even a quiver on his face, the
king respectfully took the brahmin inside and gave him
food. The brahmin was amazed at the patience of the
King and sitting before his food for some time told the
King that he would be satisfied if the King himself ate
that food. Respecting the request the King was about to
eat the flesh of his own son when the brahmin who was
none other than Brahmā in disguise praised him for
his devotion and gave him back his son adorned with
sweet smelling flowers and disappeared blessing them.
When his ministers questioned him about this Śibi said,
“I do not give for a name or fame. Neither do I give
for wealth and happiness. I do it because it is the only
way to be rid of sins”. (Chapter 168, Araṇya Parva,
M.B.).
