MEDHĀVĪ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A fierce sage. His father was a
sage known as Bāladhi. For a very long time Bāladhi
had no children and so, griefstricken, Bāladhi did
penance and Medhāvī was born as a result of his
penance. Even from boyhood the child showed wonder-
ful powers of grasping things and so he was named
Medhāvī. (Chapter 135, Vana Parva).

<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Medhāvī cursed a nymph.%} One day in spring,
Mañjughoṣā (Śucismitā), a nymph, was playing with
other companions in the Caitrarathodyāna. Medhāvī
was doing penance in a place nearby and Mañjughoṣā
fell in love with the sage and she went near him and
made love to him by dance and music. Medhāvī was
attracted by her and the sage accepted her advances
and lived with her for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>One day Mañjughoṣā sought permission to go to Deva-
loka. “Wait till daybreak” said the sage. When it was
morning the nymph renewed her request and the sage
said “Wait till I finish my evening prayers.” Hearing
this Śucismitā said “Oh, best of brahmins, how many
mornings and evenings have gone by this time! Fiftyfive
years nine months and three days have gone by since we
started living together”. The sage then counted the
years and found she was correct. The astounding fact
that his penance had such a long break made the sage
angry and he cursed her and made her into an evil
spirit. She begged for pardon and the sage said “If you
observe with fasting the Caitrakṛṣṇaikādaśī called
Pāpamocinī it will absolve you of all sins and give you
release from the curse”. (Chapter 48, Part 4, Padma
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%In Ṛgveda.%} The Aśvinīdevas once gave rice to this
sage. (Sūkta 117, Anuvāka 17, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
