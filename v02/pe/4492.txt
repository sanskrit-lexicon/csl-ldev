MEDHĀVĪ I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A fierce sage. His father was a
<div n="lb"/>sage known as Bāladhi. For a very long time Bāladhi
<div n="lb"/>had no children and so, griefstricken, Bāladhi did
<div n="lb"/>penance and Medhāvī was born as a result of his
<div n="lb"/>penance. Even from boyhood the child showed wonder-
<div n="lb"/>ful powers of grasping things and so he was named
<div n="lb"/>Medhāvī. (Chapter 135, Vana Parva).

<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Medhāvī cursed a nymph.%} One day in spring,
<div n="lb"/>Mañjughoṣā (Śucismitā), a nymph, was playing with
<div n="lb"/>other companions in the Caitrarathodyāna. Medhāvī
<div n="lb"/>was doing penance in a place nearby and Mañjughoṣā
<div n="lb"/>fell in love with the sage and she went near him and
<div n="lb"/>made love to him by dance and music. Medhāvī was
<div n="lb"/>attracted by her and the sage accepted her advances
<div n="lb"/>and lived with her for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>One day Mañjughoṣā sought permission to go to Deva-
<div n="lb"/>loka. “Wait till daybreak” said the sage. When it was
<div n="lb"/>morning the nymph renewed her request and the sage
<div n="lb"/>said “Wait till I finish my evening prayers.” Hearing
<div n="lb"/>this Śucismitā said “Oh, best of brahmins, how many
<div n="lb"/>mornings and evenings have gone by this time! Fiftyfive
<div n="lb"/>years nine months and three days have gone by since we
<div n="lb"/>started living together”. The sage then counted the
<div n="lb"/>years and found she was correct. The astounding fact
<div n="lb"/>that his penance had such a long break made the sage
<div n="lb"/>angry and he cursed her and made her into an evil
<div n="lb"/>spirit. She begged for pardon and the sage said “If you
<div n="lb"/>observe with fasting the Caitrakṛṣṇaikādaśī called
<div n="lb"/>Pāpamocinī it will absolve you of all sins and give you
<div n="lb"/>release from the curse”. (Chapter 48, Part 4, Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%In Ṛgveda.%} The Aśvinīdevas once gave rice to this
<div n="lb"/>sage. (Sūkta 117, Anuvāka 17, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
