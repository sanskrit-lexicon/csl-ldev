BRAHMĀ¦:
<div n="NI"/>One of the trimūrtis of the Hindu Pantheon. The tri-
<div n="lb"/>mūrtis are Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} God who is the creator of the
<div n="lb"/>Universe. It is mentioned in the Purāṇas that Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>creates, Viṣṇu preserves and Paramaśiva destroys the
<div n="lb"/>universe.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The birth of Brahmā.%} The birth of Brahmā is from
<div n="lb"/>the nave of Viṣṇu. It is mentioned in Devī Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 1, about the birth of Brahmā as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>In the beginning Mahāviṣṇu lay on a banian leaf in the
<div n="lb"/>shape of a baby and began to think, “Who am I? Who
<div n="lb"/>created me? What for? What is my work? Where to
<div n="lb"/>work?” and so on. At that time an ethereal voice said:—
<div n="lb"/>“Sarvaṃ khalvidamevāhaṃ nānyadasti sanāta-
<div n="lb"/>nam”.
<F>*) Idaṃ sarvaṃ khalu aham eva, Sanātanam anyad nāsti. All these are myself. Except me there is nothing eternal.</F> Mahāviṣṇu was amazed at this ethereal
<div n="lb"/>voice. He did not know whose oracle it was. Still He
<div n="lb"/>lay meditating upon the words. Then Mahādevī,
<div n="lb"/>with four hands and weapons such as Śaṅkha (conch),
<div n="lb"/>Cakra (wheel), Gadā (club), Padma (lotus) and
<div n="lb"/>maids who are prosperities and having worn glorious
<div n="lb"/>clothes and ornaments, and accompanied by the Śaktis
[Page147-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>(powers) named Rati, Bhūti, Buddhi, Mati, Kīrti,
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛti, Smṛti, Śraddhā, Medhā, Svadhā, Svāhā, Kṣudhā,
<div n="lb"/>Nidrā, Dayā, Gatī, Tuṣṭi, Puṣṭi, Kṣamā, Lajjā, Jṛṃbhā
<div n="lb"/>and Tandrā, appeared before Mahāviṣṇu, who was
<div n="lb"/>struck with wonder. Mahādevī said, “Oh, Viṣṇu, what
<div n="lb"/>is there to wonder at? Every time the universe is sub-
<div n="lb"/>jected to creation, preservation and destruction, you
<div n="lb"/>are born thus due to the great power of the supreme
<div n="lb"/>spirit. It seems that you have forgotten those matters.
<div n="lb"/>Know that the supreme power is beyond qualities. We
<div n="lb"/>are all with qualities. Your main quality is Sattva.
<div n="lb"/>From your nave Brahmā will be born. His attribute is
<div n="lb"/>Rajoguṇa (activity, passion or motion). From the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the eyebrows of Brahmā, will be born Rudra, whose
<div n="lb"/>attribute will be Tāmasaguṇa (darkness). Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>with the power of penance, will acquire the ability of
<div n="lb"/>creation and by his attribute of Rajoguṇa will create
<div n="lb"/>the world in the colour of blood. You will be the preserver
<div n="lb"/>of that world. The same world will be destroyed by
<div n="lb"/>Rudra at the end of the Kalpa (world age)”.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly from the nave of Viṣṇu a lotus grew up and
<div n="lb"/>in that lotus flower Brahmā took his form. The same
<div n="lb"/>Brahmadeva did penance before Mahāviṣṇu and Jaga-
<div n="lb"/>dambā, who were pleased at his penance and gave him
<div n="lb"/>all the boons he wanted. After that Brahmā began the
<div n="lb"/>work of creation. He created with his mind the Saptarṣis,
<div n="lb"/>(seven sages) and then the Prajāpatis (the lords of
<div n="lb"/>emanation). From them all the movables and the
<div n="lb"/>immovables in the universe came into existence. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>In manusmṛti, Chapter 1, the following stanza about the
<div n="lb"/>creation of Brahmā occurs.
<Poem>“Tadaṇḍamabhavad haimam
<div n="lb"/>Sahasrāṃśusamaprabhaṃ /
<div n="lb"/>Tasmin jajñe svayaṃ Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>Sarvalokapitāmahaḥ” //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>That egg was as radiant as the Sun, with the colour of
<div n="lb"/>gold. Brahmā the great grandfather of everything in the
<div n="lb"/>world took birth by himself in it.
<div n="NI"/>From the supreme power, an egg fell on the water which
<div n="lb"/>was the first creation. That egg became a germ of golden
<div n="lb"/>colour. Creating a life, which had done penance in its
<div n="lb"/>former births in such a way as to enable it to become
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā, in the golden germ of the egg, the supreme power
<div n="lb"/>entered the life that is to become Brahmā as its inner
<div n="lb"/>guide. That Brahmā is known as the Pitāmaha (Grand-
<div n="lb"/>father of the manes) or Paternal grandfather of all the
<div n="lb"/>worlds.”
<div n="NI"/>Vāmanapurāṇa Chapter 43 states as follows about the
<div n="lb"/>creation of Brahmā:—
<div n="NI"/>Ages before the beginning, when all the worlds with
<div n="lb"/>everything they contained were submerged in the single
<div n="lb"/>ocean of the great flood, the germ of living things formed
<div n="lb"/>itself into a big egg. Brahmā who had been inside the
<div n="lb"/>egg went to a long sleep. The sleep continued for a
<div n="lb"/>thousand yugas (ages) when Brahmā woke up; as
<div n="lb"/>Sattva guṇa (purity) was the foremost attribute of him,
<div n="lb"/>he saw that the world was void. When the thought of
<div n="lb"/>creation occurred in his mind Rajoguṇa (activity or
<div n="lb"/>passion) became his foremost attribute. Rajas is the
<div n="lb"/>attribute that creates and Sattva, that which preserves.
<div n="lb"/>At the time of destruction Tamoguṇa (darkness) be-
<div n="lb"/>comes the foremost attribute. That Bhagavān (Supreme
[Page148-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Spirit) the Puruṣa (the Male creative Energy) pervades
<div n="lb"/>over everything, in all the living worlds. That Eternal
<div n="lb"/>Being is Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Knowing that the world was lying in pure water, the
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān (Supreme Being) cut the egg open. From it the
<div n="lb"/>Oṃkāra (the sacred syllable ‘Om’) emanated. The
<div n="lb"/>first sound of it was ‘Bhūḥ’, the second, sound, ‘Bhuvaḥ’
<div n="lb"/>and the third sound ‘Svaḥ’. So they came to be known
<div n="lb"/>as “Bhūrbhuvaḥ Svaḥ”. Then the glorious radiance of
<div n="lb"/>the sun was born from it and Brahmā the grandfather of
<div n="lb"/>the worlds originated in the centre of the egg.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Instigation to compose Rāmāyaṇa.%} It was Brahmā who
<div n="lb"/>instigated Vālmīki to compose the Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>A fowler of the forest tribe shot down one of a couple of
<div n="lb"/>snipes which were carrying on love-making, on the banks
<div n="lb"/>of the River Tamasā. Seeing this Vālmīki cursed the
<div n="lb"/>fowler. The curse came out of the mouth of Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>in the form of a verse,
<F>1) You forester, your life will not continue for many years since you have killed one of the couple of snipes.</F> “mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhām tvama-
<div n="lb"/>gamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ, yat krauñcamithunādekam,
<div n="lb"/>avadhīḥ kāmamohitam,” which according to hearsay,
<div n="lb"/>is the first piece of poetry in the world. Brahmā who
<div n="lb"/>was attracted by the poetry came to the hermitage of
<div n="lb"/>Vālmīki and instigated him to compose the story of
<div n="lb"/>Rāma in verse. It is stated in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 2, that the Rāmāyaṇa was composed
<div n="lb"/>thus.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rāvaṇa is given a boon.%} It was Brahmā who made
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa an ever-powerful hero. Penance was done by
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa in the vicinity of the Himālayas and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>appeared before him and granted him the boon that no
<div n="lb"/>living creature except man, would kill him. (Vālmīki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 16).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The loss of a head.%} Long ago Śiva plucked off a head
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. This story occurs in various purāṇas with
<div n="lb"/>slight changes. Two of them are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) In olden days, in the period of Satyayuga, Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu did penance in Śvetadvīpa (the island Śveta)
<div n="lb"/>to obtain Eternal Bliss, being deeply engaged in the study
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmavidyā. Brahmā also went to another place
<div n="lb"/>and began to do penance for the suppression of passions.
<div n="lb"/>Both were doing severe penance. So they began to
<div n="lb"/>walk in order to take rest from the penance. On the way
<div n="lb"/>they met each other. One asked “who are you?” The
<div n="lb"/>other also asked the same question. The talk ended in a
<div n="lb"/>contest as to who was the greater of the two. Each
<div n="lb"/>claimed himself to be the supreme power of the world.
<div n="lb"/>Neither of them was prepared to recognize the claims
<div n="lb"/>of the other. In the midst of this contest, a phallus,
<div n="lb"/>extra-ordinarily bulky and fair appeared before them and
<div n="lb"/>an ethereal voice said from the sky: “You need not
<div n="lb"/>quarrel as to who is superior. He who reaches the extre-
<div n="lb"/>mity of this phallus is the superior person. So both of
<div n="lb"/>you proceed, one upwards and the other downwards
<div n="lb"/>and find out the end.” Hearing this Viṣṇu went down-
<div n="lb"/>wards to find out the bottom and Brahmā, upwards to
<div n="lb"/>the top. Viṣṇu travelled for a long time and finding no
<div n="lb"/>end thought the attempt futile and returned to the start-
<div n="lb"/>ing point with disappointment and sat down.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā travelled upwards for a long time and found no
<div n="lb"/>end. On the way he saw the petal of a paṇḍānus flower,
<div n="lb"/>coming down from the sky. Brahmā took it and joyfully
<div n="lb"/>returned and said haughtily to Viṣṇu: “See, I have
<div n="lb"/>taken this flower from the head of the Phallus. I have
[Page148-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>brought this to convince you. You have been defeated.
<div n="lb"/>So can you not admit that I am the superior?”
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu did not believe the words of Brahmā. So he
<div n="lb"/>called the Paṇḍānus flower to him and questioned it.
<div n="lb"/>The Paṇḍānus flower took false oath and witnessed in
<div n="lb"/>favour of Brahmā, who had asked the flower before-
<div n="lb"/>hand to be on his side. Mahāviṣṇu did not believe
<div n="lb"/>this either and said, “Let Śiva be witness to this flower”.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva at these words appeared before them and revealed
<div n="lb"/>the deceit played by Brahmā and the flower and then
<div n="lb"/>cursed the Paṇḍānus flower that thenceforward it
<div n="lb"/>should not have a place among the flowers of oblation
<div n="lb"/>to Śiva. Then Śiva got angry and plucked off a head
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā. That is the skull Śiva uses for receiving
<div n="lb"/>alms. (Devī Bhāgavata, Śkandha 5.)
<div n="NI"/>(2) In days of old all the worlds with everything in them
<div n="lb"/>were under water in a single ocean. The Sun, the
<div n="lb"/>Moon, the Stars, air, fire, everything was destroyed. A
<div n="lb"/>day of utter darkness appeared. Grass, bush all were
<div n="lb"/>destroyed. Nothing could be seen and recognized. All
<div n="lb"/>existents and non-existents were destroyed. Bhagavān,
<div n="lb"/>(Supreme Being) was sleeping continuously for so many
<div n="lb"/>thousands of nights. At the end of the night Bhagavān
<div n="lb"/>assumed the attribute of Rajas (Activity) and got ready
<div n="lb"/>for the work of creation. He, the knower of all Vedas
<div n="lb"/>and Vedāṅgas appeared in the shape of a wonderful be-
<div n="lb"/>ing with five faces. Another being with three eyes, matted
<div n="lb"/>hair, a trident in one hand, and a garland of beads in the
<div n="lb"/>other, and with darkness as its attribute took shape. That
<div n="lb"/>being was called Puruṣa (the male creative energy).
<div n="lb"/>Then the Mahātmā (the Supreme Spirit) created Ahaṃ-
<div n="lb"/>kāra (Egoism). It affected Brahmā and Śiva. Overcome
<div n="lb"/>by egoism, Śiva said to Brahmā:—“Who are you? Who
<div n="lb"/>created you?” Swelled with egoism Brahmā asked in
<div n="lb"/>reply:—“Who are you? Who are your parents? Let
<div n="lb"/>me hear it.” This talk ended in a quarrel. The origin of
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān (the Lord) was from this quarrel. Immedi-
<div n="lb"/>ately after his birth the Lord took an unparalleled lute
<div n="lb"/>and playing it, went up to the sky. Śiva being defeated
<div n="lb"/>by Brahmā, bowed his head and coloured. While Para-
<div n="lb"/>meśvara was standing angrily thus, the fifth face told
<div n="lb"/>him, “You, who are having three eyes and whose attri-
<div n="lb"/>bute is darkness! look here! I will tell you all. You, who
<div n="lb"/>wear air as garments, and ride on an ox, are the destroyer
<div n="lb"/>of the world.” Hearing these words Śiva grew more and
<div n="lb"/>more angry, opened his third eye and looked steadily
<div n="lb"/>at Brahmā to burn him. Seeing the faces shining like the
<div n="lb"/>Sun Brahmā said, “When you beat on water, bubbles will
<div n="lb"/>appear. But do they have any prowess? Hearing this,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva plucked off the head of Brahmā with the tip of his
<div n="lb"/>finger nails. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Changing Vijayalakṣmī to Laṅkālakṣmī, by curse.%} Vijaya-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī, one of the eight Lakṣmīs, was the treasury-
<div n="lb"/>keeper of Brahmā. Once she became careless in dis-
<div n="lb"/>charging her duties. Brahmā got angry and cursed her.
<div n="lb"/>“You go to Rāvaṇa and keep his tower”. She humbly
<div n="lb"/>requested for absolution from the curse. Brahmā said,
<div n="lb"/>“At the time of the incarnation of Śrī Rāma, a monkey-
<div n="lb"/>hero named Hanumān will reach Laṅkā in search of Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma's wife, whom Rāvaṇa had kidnapped. You will
<div n="lb"/>obstruct him, and he will strike you down. On that day
<div n="lb"/>you will be absolved from the curse and you will return
<div n="lb"/>here instantly.” Accordingly Vijayalakṣmī was born in
[Page149-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā under the name Laṅkālakṣmī. When Hanumān
<div n="lb"/>jumped to Laṅkā she prevented him, and he struck her
<div n="lb"/>down to the ground. (Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Brahmā cursing the daughters of Himavān.%} Three dau-
<div n="lb"/>ghters named Kuṭilā, Rāgiṇī and Pārvatī and a son
<div n="lb"/>named Sunābha were born to Himavān by his wife
<div n="lb"/>Menā. The three daughters went to the Himālayas for
<div n="lb"/>penance, to get Śiva as husband. They were not even
<div n="lb"/>six years old then. The devas saw them. The Ādityas
<div n="lb"/>and the Vasus took Kuṭilā who was doing penance, to
<div n="lb"/>the world of the gods. All the gods gathered together
<div n="lb"/>and asked Brahmā. “Oh Lord, be pleased to tell us if
<div n="lb"/>this girl will be able to bear a son who could kill Mahiṣā-
<div n="lb"/>sura”. Brahmā replied. “This poor girl will not be
<div n="lb"/>capable of bearing the radiance of Śiva. So let her go
<div n="lb"/>away.” Kuṭilā got angry at Brahmā and said “Lord,
<div n="lb"/>I will try to become fit to bear the unbearable radiance of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva. Harken, I will do penance properly and please
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and make Śiva bow his head. I take a vow to
<div n="lb"/>that effect.” Brahmā became angry and told Kuṭilā,
<div n="lb"/>“You, wicked Kuṭilā, you did not succumb to my words.
<div n="lb"/>So by my curse you will be turned to water.”
<div n="NI"/>Kuṭilā having been cursed by Brahmā became water
<div n="lb"/>and began to flood the world of Brahmā. Seeing the flow
<div n="lb"/>of water, Brahmā made cause-ways on four sides with the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas of Ṛg, Yajus, Sāma and Atharva. Thus being
<div n="lb"/>tied up she stays in the world of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas took Rāgiṇī also before Brahmā and put the
<div n="lb"/>same question. The reply of Brahmā was the same as
<div n="lb"/>before. She also got angry and said to Brahmā. “I will
<div n="lb"/>do great penance so as to enable to give birth to one in
<div n="lb"/>my family to be the killer of Mahiṣāsura.” Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>cursed her also. “You are deliberately disobeying my
<div n="lb"/>words which even devas won't gainsay. So you will be-
<div n="lb"/>come the colours of the twilight.” Thus she became the
<div n="lb"/>fast colours of the twilight, and her body was divid-
<div n="lb"/>ed among the Pleiades. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>51).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Giving a boon to a tiger and golden colour to Pārvatī.%} The
<div n="lb"/>first name of Pārvatī, the daughter of Himavān was Kālī.
<div n="lb"/>She was given this name (Kālī) because of her dark
<div n="lb"/>complexion. After the marriage Śiva and Pārvatī led a
<div n="lb"/>household life in the golden house built by Viśvakarmā.
<div n="lb"/>Once Śiva called Devī humorously, by the name Kālī.
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī got angry and said to her husband. “A wound by
<div n="lb"/>an arrow will be cured. If you cut down a tree by an
<div n="lb"/>axe it will sprout again. A wound inflicted by hard
<div n="lb"/>words will never be cured. The arrows of words shoot
<div n="lb"/>out of the mouth. Those who are hit by them suffer
<div n="lb"/>pain day and night. Wise people should not shoot them
<div n="lb"/>at others. You have violated that principle. So my lord,
<div n="lb"/>I am going to do intensive penance. I will endeavour to
<div n="lb"/>create such a condition, that you may not call me by the
<div n="lb"/>name Kālī again.” Saying thus, Pārvatī bowed before
<div n="lb"/>Parameśvara and bidding good-bye she went up into the
<div n="lb"/>air and reached the peak of Himālayas and thought of
<div n="lb"/>Jayā, Vijayā, Jayantī and Aparājitā. Instantly they
<div n="lb"/>arrived to see Kālī. They got permission and stayed with
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī to attend on her.
<div n="NI"/>While Pārvatī was engaged in doing penance, a tiger,
<div n="lb"/>with his weapons of tusks and claws came there from the
<div n="lb"/>jungles of the Himālayas. Umā (Pārvatī) was standing
<div n="lb"/>on one leg. The tiger began to think, “I shall do it when
[Page149-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>it is needed”. Thinking thus it gazed at the face of Devī
<div n="lb"/>with staring eyes and consequently it lost one eye.
<div n="NI"/>Pronouncing the word Brahmā Devī did penance for a
<div n="lb"/>hundred years. After that Brahmā, the Lord of the three
<div n="lb"/>worlds appeared before her and said to her: “I am much
<div n="lb"/>pleased. Your penance was flawless. Ask your boon.”
<div n="lb"/>Kālī replied, “Oh, Lotus-born! First give this tiger a
<div n="lb"/>boon. It will please me.” Then Brahmā gave the wonder-
<div n="lb"/>ful tiger leadership of the Gaṇas, devotion to Śiva, invin-
<div n="lb"/>cibility and righteousness. After giving the tiger this boon
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā told Pārvatī, “Now, Ambikā, ask your boon.
<div n="lb"/>Don't hesitate, I will grant the boon.” Then Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>asked the boon. “Brahmā, give me golden colour”.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā said “Let it be so”, and disappeared. The
<div n="lb"/>dark complexion of Pārvatī disappeared. She got the
<div n="lb"/>colour of the filament of the lotus flower. From the dis-
<div n="lb"/>carded skin Kātyāyanī was born. Then Indra appeared
<div n="lb"/>and asked for her as a gift. Indra requested Pārvatī on
<div n="lb"/>behalf of heaven. “Let me have her. Let this Kauśikī
<div n="lb"/>be my sister. Because she was born from your Kośa,
<div n="lb"/>(outer skin) she is Kauśikī, I am also Kauśika.” Devī
<div n="lb"/>gave the beautiful Kauśikī to Indra. Sahasrākṣa (Indra
<div n="lb"/>who has thousand eyes) took her to the Vindhya moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain; when they reached there Indra told her. “You stay
<div n="lb"/>on this mount, honoured and revered by gods. You will
<div n="lb"/>be known as Vindhyavāsinī (who stays on the Vindhya).
<div n="lb"/>He consecrated the goddess there. She was given a lion
<div n="lb"/>as her carrier (Vāhana) “You destroy the asuras?”
<div n="lb"/>saying so Indra returned to Heaven. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 54).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Brahmā became river.%} Long ago in the period of
<div n="lb"/>Cākṣuṣa manvantara (the age of a Manu), Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>decided to perform a sacrifice on the Sahya Mountain
<div n="lb"/>and preparations were made for it. Brahmā came with
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu and Śiva. Bhṛgu and the other hermits took their
<div n="lb"/>seats. Mahāviṣṇu called Svarādevī, the wife of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>But she was very slow in coming. The hermit Bhṛgu
<div n="lb"/>said to Viṣṇu: “You yourself have gone to call Devī.
<div n="lb"/>But she is very slow. The auspicious moment is coming
<div n="lb"/>to an end. So how are we to commence the rituals?”
<div n="lb"/>“If Svarā does not appear before the end of the stipulated
<div n="lb"/>time we shall seat Gāyatrī in her place,” said Viṣṇu.
<div n="lb"/>Śiva also agreed to it. So Bhṛgu seated Gāyatrī on the
<div n="lb"/>right side of Brahmā and the rituals were performed. By
<div n="lb"/>then Svarā reached the sacrificial hall. When she saw
<div n="lb"/>that Gāyatri was placed in her place and the rituals were
<div n="lb"/>performed she became angry, because of her quarrel
<div n="lb"/>with her co-wife. She called out: “Where the person to
<div n="lb"/>whom respect is due, is not given respect and where the
<div n="lb"/>person who ought not to be respected is given undue
<div n="lb"/>respect, there, scarcity, death and fear will be rampant.
<div n="lb"/>She dared to sit on the right in my place. So she will
<div n="lb"/>grow lean and become a river which will not be seen in
<div n="lb"/>the world. All of you will become rivers because you have
<div n="lb"/>placed a person lower than me in my position.” Hearing
<div n="lb"/>the curse of Svarā, Gāyatrī rose up trembling, and cursed
<div n="lb"/>Svarā also to become a river. Before Svarā was changed
<div n="lb"/>to a river, Brahmā and the other gods rose up and
<div n="lb"/>requested for absolution from the curse. Svarā said,
<div n="lb"/>“Gods, it is because you have not given oblations to
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati in the beginning of the sacrifice, that this
<div n="lb"/>break, due to my anger, has been caused. My curse
<div n="lb"/>cannot be futile. So each of you change to a river by
<div n="lb"/>your portions and we, your wives, will also become rivers
<div n="lb"/>by our portions, and flow to the west.”
[Page150-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Thus Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara became rivers
<div n="lb"/>with their portions. Brahmā became the fast-flowing
<div n="lb"/>Kukudmatī, Mahāviṣṇu changed to river Kṛṣṇā and
<div n="lb"/>Śiva, the river Veṇī. The devas also changed their
<div n="lb"/>portions to rivers and flowed from the Sahya mountain
<div n="lb"/>to the east and their wives changed to rivers by their
<div n="lb"/>portions and flowed to the west. Svarā and Gāyatrī
<div n="lb"/>flowed as two rivers to the west and then joined together
<div n="lb"/>as one river called Sāvitrī. Viṣṇu and Śiva who were
<div n="lb"/>consecrated at the sacrifice by Brahmā came to be called
<div n="lb"/>Bala and Atibala (Powerful and more powerful). This is
<div n="lb"/>the origin of the rivers in Kerala. (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 113).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Brahmā is not worshipped.%} Long ago Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu went to see Śiva near Himavān. They saw a shin-
<div n="lb"/>ing phallus there in front of them. It was of immense
<div n="lb"/>size. One of them went downwards and the other
<div n="lb"/>upwards to find out the end of it. Both returned without
<div n="lb"/>reaching the top or the bottom and by penance they
<div n="lb"/>pleased Śiva who appeared before them and asked them
<div n="lb"/>what boon they desired. Brahmā asked Śiva to take
<div n="lb"/>birth as his son. Śiva did not like this and said that no-
<div n="lb"/>body would worship Brahmā because of his extravagant
<div n="lb"/>desire (namely, to have Śiva as his son). Viṣṇu requested
<div n="lb"/>that he should be made a servant at Śiva's feet. So
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu incarnated as Śiva's Śakti (power). That Śakti is
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī. So Viṣṇu and Pārvatī are one and the same in a
<div n="lb"/>sense. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭhalambakaṃ, Ta-
<div n="lb"/>raṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The abode of Brahmā.%} It is said in Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 8, that the abode of Brahmā is on the top of
<div n="lb"/>Mount Mahāmeru. There are nine towns there. Mano-
<div n="lb"/>vatī which is in the centre, is the town of Brahmā. Due
<div n="lb"/>east of Manovatī stands Amarāvatī, the town of Indra.
<div n="lb"/>On the south-east corner there is Rajovatī which is owned
<div n="lb"/>by Agni (fire-god). Due south of Brahmapurī there is
<div n="lb"/>the town of Saṃyamanī which is the town of Yama (God
<div n="lb"/>of death) On the south west corner there is the town of
<div n="lb"/>Nirṛti. It is named Kṛṣṇāñjanā. On the west there is
<div n="lb"/>the town called Śraddhāvatī. It is the abode of God
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa. On the north-west corner there is the town
<div n="lb"/>called Gandhavatī which is the abode of Bhagavān
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu (Wind-God). Due north to Brahmapurī stands the
<div n="lb"/>town of Kubera (God of wealth). It is known by the
<div n="lb"/>name Mahodaya. On the north east corner there is the
<div n="lb"/>city of Śiva. It is known as Yaśovatī.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%The sons of Brahmā.%} Brahmā is the creator of all
<div n="lb"/>the living things in the world. Still mention is made in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas about countless divine persons who were born
<div n="lb"/>from the mind and body of Brahmā, directly and indi-
<div n="lb"/>rectly. They are given below in groups.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>65, Stanza 10, that these six grand hermits were born
<div n="lb"/>from the mind of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dhātā and Vidhātā. It is mentioned in Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 51 that these
<div n="lb"/>two were good sons born to Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Rudra. Mention is made in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>20, that Brahmā had a roaring son who was named
<div n="lb"/>Rudra.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Svāyaṃbhuva Manu. It occurs in Bhāgavata
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 11, that Manu Svāyaṃbhuva was the son of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(5) Kandarpa (Kāmadeva—Cupid). In Kathāsarit-
[Page150-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>sāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃbaka, Taraṅga, 6, it is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>that Cupid was born from the Egoism of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(6) Madhuka and Golikā. In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, men-
<div n="lb"/>tion is made that from the playful habit of Brahmā, a
<div n="lb"/>giant named Madhuka and a giantess named Golikā
<div n="lb"/>were born.
<div n="NI"/>(7) Bhṛgu. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 5, Stanza 8, that the hermit Bhṛgu was the son
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(8) Jāṃbavān. It is seen in Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa that
<div n="lb"/>Jāṃbavān was born from the sweat of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(9) The Sanakas. In Bhāgavata mention is made that
<div n="lb"/>the Sanakas (Sanaka, Sananda, Sanātana and Sanat-
<div n="lb"/>kumāra) were sons of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(10) In Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva there is a
<div n="lb"/>passage given as the words of Vasiṣṭha spoken to Bhṛgu,
<div n="lb"/>about the birth of many of the sons of Brahmā. “May
<div n="lb"/>I tell you a story I have heard long ago about the revela-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Brahmā of himself?
<div n="NI"/>Lord Rudra took the form of Varuṇa and performed a
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. Many hermits, all the devas, Agni and others,
<div n="lb"/>Vaṣaṭk ra (Exclamation in sacrifice) which took body,
<div n="lb"/>and all yajñāṅgas came to the sacrificial hall. All the
<div n="lb"/>expedients, all the glories which are thousands in number
<div n="lb"/>took shape and came to the sacrifice. Ṛgveda arrayed
<div n="lb"/>in garments of heroism came there. All the omens, all
<div n="lb"/>the voices, all the emotions, all the etymologies of pro-
<div n="lb"/>nouncing Veda Sūktas, all the svarabhaktikas, Oṃkāra
<div n="lb"/>(the syllable Oṃ) the eye of all the Vedic metres and
<div n="lb"/>their theories, all restraints and donations, all Vedas,
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads, accomplishments, Sāvitrī, the past, the near
<div n="lb"/>future and distant future, all these came there. The
<div n="lb"/>Lord Śiva held everyone of them. He offered his spirit
<div n="lb"/>by his spirit. The sacrifice took many forms and shed
<div n="lb"/>radiances. Paramaśiva is heaven, is the sky, is the earth,
<div n="lb"/>is the ether and the husband of the Earth, is the lord
<div n="lb"/>of all accomplishments, is noble and the lord of radiance.
<div n="lb"/>This Lord is lauded by the names Brahmā, Śiva, Rudra,
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, Agni, and Prabhāvatī. Śiva is the King of all
<div n="lb"/>the worlds. Penances, sacrifices, vows emblazed by fast,
<div n="lb"/>all the directions and gods of directions, Indras, celestial
<div n="lb"/>maids, mothers of the worlds, all these assumed forms
<div n="lb"/>and came to the sacrifice in multitudes. Everybody who
<div n="lb"/>witnessed the sacrifice of Parameśvara, who was in the
<div n="lb"/>form of Varuṇa, was greatly pleased. Seeing the pleased
<div n="lb"/>celestial maids standing in rows passion arose in Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>He had seminal discharge. Āditya (the Sun) took the
<div n="lb"/>earth on which the semen fell and threw it into the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficial fire, which blazed furiously. Brahmā who became
<div n="lb"/>the offerer of oblation had discharge again. He got it in
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial ladle and with recitation of spells offered
<div n="lb"/>it in the sacrificial fire as if it was ghee. The powerful
<div n="lb"/>semen contained the three attributes of Sattva, Rajas
<div n="lb"/>and Tamas. From the attribute of Rajas arose the
<div n="lb"/>living world which had activity as its purpose. Radiance
<div n="lb"/>is the quality of Sattva which entered the living and non-
<div n="lb"/>living world. It gives light to everything. It also gives
<div n="lb"/>the power of discrimination. From the semen offered
<div n="lb"/>in the fire, three sons with body and the attributes of
<div n="lb"/>demi-gods came out. The male who had originated from
<div n="lb"/>the flame called ‘Bharjana’ became Aṅgiras. The male
<div n="lb"/>who originated from the burning coals became Kavi.
<div n="lb"/>Over and above these three radiances, other radiances
<div n="lb"/>also originated from the sacrificial fire. From the Marīcis
[Page151-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>(rays) of the fire Marīci the father of Kaśyapa was born.
<div n="lb"/>From the Kuśa-grass spread on the floor of the hall of
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice, the Bālakhilyas were born. Atri also was
<div n="lb"/>born from the Kuśa-grass. The noble hermits called
<div n="lb"/>Vaikhānasas, who have grown powerful by penance and
<div n="lb"/>became the seat of all good qualities, were born from
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial ashes. From the stream of fire which are
<div n="lb"/>the eyes of the sacrificial fire the handsome Aśvins
<div n="lb"/>were born. The rest of the Prajāpatis were born from
<div n="lb"/>the ears of the fire. From the pores of the skin of fire
<div n="lb"/>were born the hermits, from the sweat the ‘chandas’
<div n="lb"/>(metre of Vedas) and from might, the mind. For this
<div n="lb"/>reason the Vedic scholars and knowers of the Śruti and
<div n="lb"/>those who see the superiority of Vedas, say that fire is a
<div n="lb"/>combination of all the gods. The trees that feed the fire
<div n="lb"/>are called Māsas (months), the sap of the tree is called
<div n="lb"/>Pakṣa (half of the month i.e. full moon to new moon and
<div n="lb"/>new moon to full moon), the pith of the tree is called
<div n="lb"/>night and day and the flames are called Muhūrtas
<div n="lb"/>(auspicious moments). Rudras were born from the
<div n="lb"/>blood of fire and the golden coloured gods, the Maitras,
<div n="lb"/>also were born from the blood of fire. From the smoke
<div n="lb"/>of the fire, the Vasus, from the flame of the fire Rudras
<div n="lb"/>and the Ādityas of the extreme radiance were born.
<div n="lb"/>The planets and stars which stand in their places in
<div n="lb"/>the sky are the charcoal of the fire. Brahmā declared that
<div n="lb"/>fire was Brahmā the supreme spirit, eternal and the
<div n="lb"/>giver of all wishes. The sinless Mahādeva, who was in
<div n="lb"/>the form of Varuṇa said, “This sacrificial fire is mine,
<div n="lb"/>and I am the sacrificer. So the children born as the first
<div n="lb"/>fruit of this sacrifice are mine. So Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras and
<div n="lb"/>Kavi are my sons, no doubt. Let everybody who moves
<div n="lb"/>along the sky know that these three are my sons, the
<div n="lb"/>fruit of my sacrifice.” Agni said, “These are born from
<div n="lb"/>my organs. They had been depending on me for their
<div n="lb"/>sustenance. So they are my sons.” Brahmā the teacher
<div n="lb"/>of all the worlds and the grandfather of all living beings
<div n="lb"/>said, “They are my sons. I offered my sperm to the fire,
<div n="lb"/>and these sons were born therefrom, How can they be
<div n="lb"/>claimed by anybody else? Here, I am the utterer of the
<div n="lb"/>spell and the offerer of the sperm. I am the owner of
<div n="lb"/>the sperm. Am I not the owner of the fruit? There is no
<div n="lb"/>contest on the point that the birth of Bhṛgu and others is
<div n="lb"/>from the oblation of my sperm.” The Gods who heard
<div n="lb"/>these arguments bowed their heads before Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>greeting him said, “Lord Brahmā, It is not only us that
<div n="lb"/>are born from you, but the entire world of living and
<div n="lb"/>non-living is born from you. So let Agni and Deva in
<div n="lb"/>the shape of Varuṇa have their wishes.”
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Brahmā and the giantess Karkkaṭī.%} In days of old, a
<div n="lb"/>ferocious giantess named Karkkaṭī lived on the northern
<div n="lb"/>side of the Himālayas. Because of the hugeness of her
<div n="lb"/>body and the scarcity of food she became famished. She
<div n="lb"/>began to do penance for the alleviation of her hunger
<div n="lb"/>and thirst. She stood on one leg in the Himālaya Moun-
<div n="lb"/>tain, fixing her eyes on the sun in the day and on the
<div n="lb"/>Moon in the night, and the severe penance continued
<div n="lb"/>for a thousand years. Then Brahmā appeared before her
<div n="lb"/>and told her that she could ask for any boon. She said
<div n="lb"/>“I wish to become a Sūcī (Needle) as hard as iron, hav-
<div n="lb"/>ing the form of disease. This is the boon I pray for,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā”. Brahmā blessed her and said, “Let it be so,
<div n="lb"/>my daughter, you shall be a sūcikā (needle) with the
<div n="lb"/>prefix ‘V’ that is Viśūcikā (Spasmodic cholera) You
<div n="lb"/>can eat those who eat stale food, those who are wicked,
[Page151-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>those who sit in places where they ought not to sit and
<div n="lb"/>those who are hard-hearted. Enter into their bodies and
<div n="lb"/>affect their hearts, spleens and life-breaths. Thus carry
<div n="lb"/>out the work of destruction? You can affect both the
<div n="lb"/>good and the bad. But good people should not be killed.
<div n="lb"/>So to save them from death, you can use this mantra
<div n="lb"/>(spell).
<div n="NI"/>“oṃ, hrāṃ, hrīṃ, śrīṃ, śāṃ, viṣṇuśaktaye, namaḥ;
<div n="lb"/>bhagavati viṣṇuśakti ehi, enāṃ hara hara: dehe hana
<div n="lb"/>hana? paca paca! matha matha: utsādaya utsā-
<div n="lb"/>daya: dūre kuru kuru svāhā—viṣūcike! tvaṃ hima-
<div n="lb"/>vantaṃ gaccha? jīvasaraḥ candramaṇḍalaṃ gatāsi
<div n="lb"/>svāhā.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying these words Brahmā disappeared. Karkkaṭī made
<div n="lb"/>her body smaller and smaller and finally assumed the
<div n="lb"/>shape of a needle. After that she began her work by
<div n="lb"/>entering the body of those who had lost their energy
<div n="lb"/>because of illness, in the form of a needle of gout and
<div n="lb"/>caused Cholera, and the body of those who were lean
<div n="lb"/>and worn and weary, in the form of internal cholera.
<div n="lb"/>Thus assuming two bodies and killing countless people
<div n="lb"/>she travelled for a long time in the earth and the sky,
<div n="lb"/>until she herself felt aversion to her work. When she
<div n="lb"/>remembered her original form she loathed the needle-
<div n="lb"/>form. Karkkaṭī again went to the vicinity of the Himā-
<div n="lb"/>layas and began to do penance, which lasted for another
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. Thus she became pure and by the
<div n="lb"/>power of thinking, she acquired spiritual knowledge.
<div n="lb"/>Then she wanted to be saved from the mirage of birth
<div n="lb"/>and death, to attain which, she did penance for yet
<div n="lb"/>another thousand years at the end of which, the highly
<div n="lb"/>pleased Brahmā appeared before her and said, “daugh-
<div n="lb"/>ter Karkkaṭī, all the darkness is erased from your heart
<div n="lb"/>and you have attained deliverance from delusion. Now
<div n="lb"/>I will bless you according to your wish. Receive your
<div n="lb"/>original body and walk about in the worlds eating the
<div n="lb"/>ignorant, bad beginners, the imprudent, those who sit in
<div n="lb"/>bad places and dwell in bad places.”
<div n="NI"/>She became a giantess again, but as she had attained
<div n="lb"/>purity of soul, she engaged herself in deep meditation
<div n="lb"/>which was free from doubt. The meditation lasted for a
<div n="lb"/>long time. Finally her mind waved. Then she remem-
<div n="lb"/>bered about worldly things and felt hunger. She remem-
<div n="lb"/>bered, “Brahmā has ordained the wicked as my food.
<div n="lb"/>So I shall seek them.” Thinking thus she went to a jungle
<div n="lb"/>in the vicinity of the Himālayas. That was the dwelling
<div n="lb"/>place of foresters. In that dark night the King and the
<div n="lb"/>minister of the foresters approached the place where
<div n="lb"/>Karkkaṭī sat. Karkkaṭī seeing them thought, “let me
<div n="lb"/>know first if they are good or bad.” So she decided to
<div n="lb"/>ask them some questions.
<div n="NI"/>She asked them in a voice like thunder. “Who are you?
<div n="lb"/>Are you enlightened sages or ignorant fools? say quickly.”
<div n="lb"/>The king of the foresters hearing this replied in a cynical
<div n="lb"/>way. “You insignificant ghost? What is your form?
<div n="lb"/>Where do you sit? Let us see your powerless body. Who
<div n="lb"/>is there to fear at your sound which is like the humming
<div n="lb"/>of a she-beetle?”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this reply Karkkaṭī showed her tusks and lau-
<div n="lb"/>ghed loud, to spread light, and to terrify them. They
<div n="lb"/>heard the loud roaring sound of her laugh and saw her
<div n="lb"/>huge form in the light. But those mighty heroes were
<div n="lb"/>not at all shaken by the sound they heard or the sight
<div n="lb"/>they witnessed. The Minister looked at her and said,
<div n="lb"/>“Hei, Giantess? These delusions of yours will have no
[Page152-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>effect on us. Even if a number of mosquitoes like you
<div n="lb"/>come before us, they will be only dry leaves before wind.
<div n="lb"/>You are acting like this merely for food. So what is
<div n="lb"/>your need? Tell us, we will satisfy you”.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the words of the minister Karkkaṭī knew that
<div n="lb"/>her might was useless before such valiant men. She
<div n="lb"/>thought them to be sages. So she said “Hey mighty
<div n="lb"/>heroes. Who are you? Tell me the truth”. The minister
<div n="lb"/>said: “This the King of foresters and I am his minister.
<div n="lb"/>We came for a night-walk to find out and punish wicked
<div n="lb"/>people like you.”
<div n="NI"/>The giantess appreciated them and said: “I am about to
<div n="lb"/>put some questions to you. If you give me suitable ans-
<div n="lb"/>wers you will be saved.” The King agreed. The ques-
<div n="lb"/>tions put by her are given below in the order they were
<div n="lb"/>asked:—
<div n="NI"/>1) Inside what atom which is unit and multiple at the
<div n="lb"/>same time, do the lakhs of universes originate and vanish
<div n="lb"/>as bubbles in a sea?
<div n="NI"/>2) What does shine as ether and non-ether?
<div n="NI"/>3) What is it that is something and nothing?
<div n="NI"/>4) What is it that is going and not going at the same
<div n="lb"/>time?
<div n="NI"/>5) What is it that has taken form from voidness?
<div n="NI"/>6) What is it that is moving and at the same time station-
<div n="lb"/>ary as a rock?
<div n="NI"/>7) Who draws pictures in clear sky?
<div n="NI"/>8) In what seed do the worlds exist as a big tree in its
<div n="lb"/>seed?
<div n="NI"/>9) From what substance can the living and non-living
<div n="lb"/>things in the worlds, not be separated as the foam and
<div n="lb"/>waves cannot be separated from the ocean?
<div n="NI"/>10) What substance is dualism not separate from
<div n="lb"/>(others) as fluidity from water?
<div n="NI"/>The reply given by the minister to each question is given
<div n="lb"/>below in the order of the questions.
<div n="NI"/>1) Hey, Giantess: All the questions you have put be-
<div n="lb"/>fore us encased in figurative words discernible only to
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic sages, are concerned with the supreme Being.
<div n="lb"/>The atom is the supreme Spirit which is beyond all
<div n="lb"/>knowledge of the mind and the senses. As it is without
<div n="lb"/>organs of action it is as unmanifested as the sky. And
<div n="lb"/>inside that supreme atom which could be felt only by the
<div n="lb"/>mind, crores and crores of bubbles of universes originate
<div n="lb"/>and vanish due to frailty.
<div n="NI"/>2) The impersonal Supreme Being, having no substance,
<div n="lb"/>pervades everything. This Supreme Being, Brahman,
<div n="lb"/>is pure knowledge (Jñānasvarūpa). It is the sky and the
<div n="lb"/>non-sky.
<div n="NI"/>3) As it is indescribable the Impersonal Supreme Spirit
<div n="lb"/>is nothing, but as it is a reality it is something.
<div n="NI"/>4) As it pervades everything accessible, the Impersonal
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Spirit has the quality of motion. But as it has
<div n="lb"/>no emotions and as there exists no space beyond, it is
<div n="lb"/>motionless.
<div n="NI"/>5) As it is inaccessible to others the Supreme Spirit is
<div n="lb"/>having no existence, but as it is the essence of everything
<div n="lb"/>that is good, it has existence.
<div n="NI"/>6) The Supreme Spirit is the radiance of motion or
<div n="lb"/>activity and as there is nothing else to be found out, that
<div n="lb"/>is, as it doesn't know anything else it is as rigid as a
<div n="lb"/>rock.
<div n="NI"/>7) In the clear sky the Supreme Spirit draws the pictures
<div n="lb"/>of the universe.
<div n="NI"/>8) Exists in the Supreme Atom.
[Page152-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>9) As the entire visible world cannot be separated from
<div n="lb"/>the Supreme Spirit nothing is other than the Impersonal
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Spirit.
<div n="NI"/>10) The differentiations of the various worlds are mere
<div n="lb"/>appearances of the Supreme Spirit and so dualism is of the
<div n="lb"/>same figure.
<div n="NI"/>The King drew Karkkaṭī nearer to the Impersonal
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Spirit. He advised her not to commit slaughter.
<div n="lb"/>She accepted the advice. The King asked her to come
<div n="lb"/>to his palace assuming the form of a beautiful woman.
<div n="lb"/>She asked, what could he offer to a giantess as food.
<div n="lb"/>The King said: “You good woman, we shall find out a
<div n="lb"/>way for that. You change yourself to a beautiful woman
<div n="lb"/>wearing golden ornaments and stay in my palace for a
<div n="lb"/>while. I shall arrange to gather sinners, robbers and
<div n="lb"/>such other wicked people who are to be given capital
<div n="lb"/>punishment, in thousands from various places, and shall
<div n="lb"/>give them to you. You can take your original form and
<div n="lb"/>take them all to the peaks of the Himalaya and feed on
<div n="lb"/>them.
<div n="NI"/>Gluttonous people like to eat in solitude. After having
<div n="lb"/>eaten sumptuously, take some sleep, and a little rest in
<div n="lb"/>meditation. When you wake up you come again and
<div n="lb"/>take away people destined to be killed. The slaughter
<div n="lb"/>done for the sake of righteousness is not a sin. It is said
<div n="lb"/>to be equal to mercy. When your desire for meditation
<div n="lb"/>is over you must come to me. If an attachment of love
<div n="lb"/>is formed even with bad persons it is difficult to break
<div n="lb"/>the love.”
<div n="NI"/>Karkkaṭī obeyed the King. They all reached the palace.
<div n="lb"/>Within six days three thousand wicked persons, who
<div n="lb"/>were sentenced to death, were brought before the King,
<div n="lb"/>from his own country and the various dependent coun-
<div n="lb"/>tries, and were given to Karkkaṭī. In the night she took
<div n="lb"/>her original form, gathered all the wicked people, who
<div n="lb"/>deserved killing and bidding good bye to the King,
<div n="lb"/>went to the Peaks of the Himālayas. (Jñānavāsiṣṭha).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Brahmā and Haindavas.%} At the end of the day of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā there was the great flood, and destroying all the
<div n="lb"/>heavens, Brahmā went to sleep. He woke up next morn-
<div n="lb"/>ing and after the usual morning ablutions, prepared for
<div n="lb"/>creation. He looked around at the sky, and saw some
<div n="lb"/>heavens still engaged in usual activities. He was amazed
<div n="lb"/>at this unusual occurrence. Ten Brahmās and the count-
<div n="lb"/>less devas (gods) under them were doing their routine
<div n="lb"/>work. Brahmā stared at the worlds for a long time think-
<div n="lb"/>ing “How is it”. Then he by his divine power caused one
<div n="lb"/>of the suns, working in a heaven, to come to him, and
<div n="lb"/>asked him. “Who are you, shining one? How have these
<div n="lb"/>worlds come into existence?”
<div n="NI"/>The Sun said with humility. “Your sons Marīci and
<div n="lb"/>others erected a beautiful shed called Suvarṇataṭam,
<div n="lb"/>in a corner of Jaṃbudvīpa in the valley below Kailāsa.
<div n="lb"/>A Brāhmaṇa named Indu arose from that hall.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmāṇa who was a Vedic scholar, righteous
<div n="lb"/>and peaceful, led the life of a house-holder with his
<div n="lb"/>wife for a long time. But they were childless. So they
<div n="lb"/>went to Kailāsa and did penance to get children. They
<div n="lb"/>entered a natural arbour which was quite silent and began
<div n="lb"/>severe penance. Śiva appeared and said that they
<div n="lb"/>would get children.
<div n="NI"/>In course of time, ten sons were born to them. After
<div n="lb"/>a long time, when the sons had reached manhood the
<div n="lb"/>old parents died. The sons felt very sorry. They regarded
<div n="lb"/>life as short and full of woe and misery. So they went for
[Page153-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>penance, as they had no relatives left to care for them.
<div n="lb"/>They abstained from all the pleasures of the world and
<div n="lb"/>reached Kailāsa. They began to meditate upon the
<div n="lb"/>shortness of life. “What is there which is noble in this
<div n="lb"/>world? Is there anything except woe and misery? How
<div n="lb"/>simple is the desire of man for greatness? One thinks
<div n="lb"/>himself prosperous if he becomes a house-holder. The
<div n="lb"/>head of the village is more prosperous than a house-
<div n="lb"/>holder. The King of a dependent state is more powerful
<div n="lb"/>than the head of a village. An independent king is far
<div n="lb"/>more prosperous than a dependent King. When we
<div n="lb"/>think of the state of an emperor how simple is an inde-
<div n="lb"/>pendent king! When compared with Indra, the Lord
<div n="lb"/>of the three worlds what is an emperor after all? But
<div n="lb"/>there is nothing glorious in the state of Indra also as it
<div n="lb"/>ends in a Brahmamuhūrtta (a period in the life of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā). So what is there substantial and eternal?
<div n="lb"/>“Brahmā alone is eternal and indestructible.” said the
<div n="lb"/>eldest brother. “Concentrate your mind and say to your-
<div n="lb"/>self, ‘I am the supreme Being Brahmā seated on a lotus’,
<div n="lb"/>and meditate upon it and pray for it and knowledge of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā will be conferred upon you.” They understood
<div n="lb"/>this and thus the ten brothers became Brahmās. There
<div n="lb"/>are ten heavens of them. They are ten worlds in the
<div n="lb"/>sky of mind. I am the sun who creates day and night in
<div n="lb"/>one of them,” saying thus the Sun went away. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>commenced his activity. (Jñānavāsiṣṭha).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%The age of Brahmā.%} Forty-three crores twenty lacs
<div n="lb"/>of human years is one four-yuga period called ‘Deva-
<div n="lb"/>caturyuga’ (a period of four yugas of the devas or gods).
<div n="lb"/>One thousand deva caturyugas will make one Mahāyuga
<div n="lb"/>(great yuga) A Mahāyuga is a day time of Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>During the period of one Mahāyuga, that is, during
<div n="lb"/>one day of Brahmā, fourteen Manus, one after another,
<div n="lb"/>help Brahmā in doing the work of creation. This is the
<div n="lb"/>time of the seventh Manu in the present day time
<div n="lb"/>(Kalpa) of the present Brahmā. The period of six Manus
<div n="lb"/>are over in the present day time of the present Brahmā.
<div n="lb"/>Vaivasvata is the present Manu. Brahmā wakes up in
<div n="lb"/>the morning—the beginning of a Kalpa. Those which
<div n="lb"/>underwent destruction in the night, are created again
<div n="lb"/>in the morning. As Brahmā wakes up daily in the morn-
<div n="lb"/>ing, what are the things created before, which do not
<div n="lb"/>undergo destruction? At that time there will remain,
<div n="lb"/>without destruction, six or twentyfour tattvas (princi-
<div n="lb"/>ples) which are natural creations. These twenty-four
<div n="lb"/>principles are not the creation of Brahmā. He who is
<div n="lb"/>beyond names, He who created Brahmā in the lotus
<div n="lb"/>flower, created them. Brahmā who was originated in the
<div n="lb"/>lotus which grew from the nave of Nārāyaṇa performs
<div n="lb"/>the work of creation guided by these twentyfour princi-
<div n="lb"/>ples. The work of creation performed by Brahmā is
<div n="lb"/>called Pratisarga (substitute creation). Everything
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā created in the day time will be destroyed in the
<div n="lb"/>evening. After a day time is over there is the night time
<div n="lb"/>and sleep for Brahmā. The life of Brahmā is hundred
<div n="lb"/>years, that is thirty-six thousand Brahmā days and
<div n="lb"/>and Brahmā nights. At the expiry of this period the life
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā will come to an end, and will dissolve in
<div n="lb"/>Nārāyaṇa. Thus crores and crores of Brahmās have
<div n="lb"/>appeared and passed away and in future also crores
<div n="lb"/>will appear and pass away. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%The creations and substitute creations of Brahmā.%} The
<div n="lb"/>creations performed by Brahmā are of two kinds. The
<div n="lb"/>first is Sarga or creation and the second is Pratisarga or
[Page153-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>substitute creation. In the first Kalpa when a Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>is born from the lotus, certain creations are made and
<div n="lb"/>the things thus originated do not undergo destruction in
<div n="lb"/>the evening or at the end of the Kalpa. They are the
<div n="lb"/>sarga or creation. On that day and every day of the life
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā they help Brahmā in the work of creation.
<div n="lb"/>In a sense they could be called Prajāpatis (the lords of
<div n="lb"/>emanation). But as most of them have not left sons,
<div n="lb"/>and for other reasons also, they are not well known by
<div n="lb"/>that name. Only the persons mentioned here have as
<div n="lb"/>long a life as that of Brahmā. The Sanakas, Karddama,
<div n="lb"/>Marīci, Atri, Aṅgiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhṛgu,
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, Dakṣa, Nārada, Dharma, Adharma, Nirṛti,
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī, Kāma, Atharva, the Manes, Agni, Sthāṇu,
<div n="lb"/>and Svāyaṃbhuva: these do not end at the end of a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā's day (or Kalpa) and will be dissolved only when
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā is dissolved. A Brahmā creates in his first morn-
<div n="lb"/>ing not only persons from Sanaka to Svāyaṃbhuva, but
<div n="lb"/>also creations which have a history only up to the end
<div n="lb"/>of that day, such as the lokas (worlds) of Bhūloka,
<div n="lb"/>Bhuvarloka and Svarloka, and minerals, plants, animals,
<div n="lb"/>humanity etc. Sarga or creation is called Prākṛta Sṛṣṭi
<div n="lb"/>(natural creation). Pratisarga or substitute creation
<div n="lb"/>is called Aprākṛta Sṛṣṭi or unnatural creation. At the
<div n="lb"/>end of the Kalpa, Saṃvarttakāgni (Fire which destroys
<div n="lb"/>the universe) and Saṃvarttaka varṣā (Rain which des-
<div n="lb"/>troys the universe) will occur and all the unnatural crea-
<div n="lb"/>tions will be destroyed. In all the morning, following
<div n="lb"/>the first morning of a Brahmā substitute creation takes
<div n="lb"/>place, and they are destroyed at the end of each Kalpa
<div n="lb"/>by Saṃvarttakāgni and Saṃvarttakavarṣā. (Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata).

<div n="NI"/>(52) In almost all the Purāṇas Brahmā is called ‘Catur-
<div n="lb"/>mukha’ (having four faces) and to substantiate this the
<div n="lb"/>following story is given in the Matsyapurāṇa. Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>created Śatarūpā with half the portion of his body, and
<div n="lb"/>accepted that bright and beautiful woman as his wife.
<div n="lb"/>He could not bear his beautiful wife to be away from
<div n="lb"/>his sight even for a moment. So much had he become
<div n="lb"/>attached to her.
<div n="NI"/>One day Śatarūpā was walking round Brahmā. The
<div n="lb"/>daughters born from his mind also were seated close by.
<div n="lb"/>So he could not turn round and round and look at his
<div n="lb"/>wife as she was moving. To solve this problem, in place
<div n="lb"/>of one face, there arose four faces.
<div n="NI"/>Once Śatarūpā was walking in the air. To see her at
<div n="lb"/>that time there arose a fifth head on the top of his matted
<div n="lb"/>hair. It is this face that was plucked off by Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>(53) Various stories occur in the purāṇas regarding how
<div n="lb"/>Śiva plucked off the fifth head of Brahmā. They are
<div n="lb"/>given below.
[Page155-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once Brahmā praised Śiva and pleased him and
<div n="lb"/>asked him to become his son. Śiva did not like it. He
<div n="lb"/>got angry and cursed, “I shall become your son. But I
<div n="lb"/>will pluck off your fifth head.”
<div n="NI"/>(2) In the beginning Brahmā created the incarnation
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva, called Nīlalohita also, along with the creation
<div n="lb"/>of worlds and everything in it. In later creations Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>did not think of Nīlalohita. Seeing Brahmā carrying
<div n="lb"/>on the work of creation forgetting him, Nīlalohita got
<div n="lb"/>angry and cursed Brahmā, “Your fifth head will shortly
<div n="lb"/>be destroyed.”
<div n="NI"/>(3) After Brahmā became five-faced the brightness of
<div n="lb"/>the devas began to decrease day by day. Seeing this the
<div n="lb"/>conceited Brahmā said to Śiva: “I am the first who got
<div n="lb"/>existence in this world. So by all means I am the eldest.”
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this Śiva got angry and plucked off the fifth
<div n="lb"/>head of Brahmā and threw it away. (Matsyapurāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>183, 84-86).
<div n="NI"/>When the fifth head was gone, the rest of the heads were
<div n="lb"/>benumbed. The sweat which flowed from them was
<div n="lb"/>thrown into the earth by Brahmā. Out of it came out
<div n="lb"/>a horrible monster, which began to chase Śiva, who
<div n="lb"/>caught hold of it and gave it to Viṣṇu. (Skanda, 5,
<div n="lb"/>13, 4).
<div n="NI"/>(4) In the Śiva-Rudra collections a story occurs about
<div n="lb"/>the quarrel between Śiva and Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā fell in love with Satī the wife of Śiva;
<div n="lb"/>coming to know of this Śiva tried to kill Brahmā. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>viṣṇu tried to pacify Śiva, but it was of no avail. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>took away the fifth head of Brahmā and made him ugly,
<div n="lb"/>and consequently Brahmā became invincible in the
<div n="lb"/>world.
<div n="NI"/>(5) Once Śiva showed his daughter Sandhyā to Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>who grew lustful instantly; Śiva insulted Brahmā by
<div n="lb"/>showing this ill-owned passion of his to his sons
<div n="lb"/>(Brahmā's sons). As a revenge Brahmā created Satī
<div n="lb"/>and insulted Śiva through Dakṣa. (Skanda, 2, 2, 26).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Various names of Brahmā and their meanings:%} In Amara-
