BRĀHMAṆA¦. (BRĀHMIN).
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Origin.%} Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, and Śūdras
<div n="lb"/>are the caturvarṇas or the four castes. The Purāṇas say
<div n="lb"/>that the four castes originated from different parts of
<div n="lb"/>the body of Brahmā. See Manusmṛti, Chapter 1,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 87
<Poem>“Sarvasyāsya tu sargasya
<div n="lb"/>Guptyarthaṃ sa mahādyutiḥ
<div n="lb"/>Mukhabāhūrūpajjānāṃ
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthakkarmāṇyakalpayat.</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(With a view to sustain the world, Brahmā ordered acti-
<div n="lb"/>vities, for the four castes (Brāhmaṇa Kṣatriya, Vaiśya,
<div n="lb"/>and Śūdra) who were born from his face, arms, thighs
<div n="lb"/>and feet). From this statement it is seen that the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas were born from the face, Kṣatriyas from the
<div n="lb"/>arms, Vaiśyas from the thighs and Sūdras from the feet
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The activities of a Brāhmaṇa.%} The duties of a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>are, performing sacrifice, and encouraging others to
<div n="lb"/>perform sacrifice, learning Vedas and teaching Vedas,
<div n="lb"/>giving gifts and getting remuneration. A Brāhmaṇa has
<div n="lb"/>two births in one life. Till the time of investiture with
<div n="lb"/>the sacred string is one birth and from that period on-
<div n="lb"/>wards is the second birth. So a Brāhmaṇa is called
<div n="lb"/>‘dvija’ or twice-born.
<div n="NI"/>The Brāhmaṇas were allowed to do the works of agri-
<div n="lb"/>culture, keeping cows, trade and commerce and Kusīda
<div n="lb"/>(money-lending). Living on the interest of money
<div n="lb"/>giving out as loan is Kusīda. But they should not trade
<div n="lb"/>on products from cow, jaggery, salt, lac and flesh.
<div n="lb"/>The suffix ‘Śarmā’ should be added to the name of
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa. A Brāhmaṇa can have four wives.
