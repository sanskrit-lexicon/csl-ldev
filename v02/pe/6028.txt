SAMĀDHICHEṬṬI¦. A Vaiśya who became learned
<div n="lb"/>and abstemious by the grace of Devī. The story of this
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya, who ran away from the cruel and wicked
<div n="lb"/>treatment that he had suffered from his wife and
<div n="lb"/>children, and took to spiritual knowledge by the force
<div n="lb"/>of circumstances was told to Janamejaya by Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>After telling several stories about the kind regard of
<div n="lb"/>Devī towards those who worship her with devotion,
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa continued as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>During the time of Svārociṣa Manu, there lived a
<div n="lb"/>King named Suratha. Because of his liberality and
<div n="lb"/>truthfulness he had very few enemies. While he was
<div n="lb"/>ruling over the kingdom known as Kolāpura, once the
<div n="lb"/>low caste people of the mountains fought a battle with
<div n="lb"/>the King. Though the army of the low castes was
<div n="lb"/>small it was the King who sustained defeat. He
<div n="lb"/>returned to the palace thoughtful. He had no peace of
<div n="lb"/>mind. So he went to the forest to get peace. After
<div n="lb"/>travelling for a long time on horse-back, he reached the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of the sage Sumedhas. Forgetting himself
<div n="lb"/>in the peaceful stillness of the hermitage, the King got
<div n="lb"/>down from the horse and sat under a tree. The hermit
<div n="lb"/>Sumedhas came there and talked with the King.
<div n="lb"/>The King told his story to the hermit, who invited the
<div n="lb"/>King to live with him. Thus the King lived in the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage eating fruits, roots etc.
<div n="NI"/>The King found it difficult to reconcile himself with
<div n="lb"/>the purity and simplicity of the hermit's surroundings.
<div n="lb"/>He always thought of his wife and children. He was
<div n="lb"/>troubled in mind by thinking that the money kept in
<div n="lb"/>the treasury would be wasted by others. Thus thinking
<div n="lb"/>about many things, with a troubled mind, the King
<div n="lb"/>was sitting under a tree near the hermitage once when
<div n="lb"/>he saw another man coming towards him, with a
<div n="lb"/>troubled mind like himself. They talked with each
<div n="lb"/>other. The new-comer said to the King “I am a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya. My name is Samādhiceṭṭi. My wife and
<div n="lb"/>children love wealth. They want to take possession of
<div n="lb"/>my wealth and to waste it. But I was against it. I did
<div n="lb"/>not favour unnecessary expenditure. They resolved to
<div n="lb"/>remove the obstacle from their path, and began to
<div n="lb"/>make preparation for it secretly. I understood it and
<div n="lb"/>fearing death I ran away from the house.”
<div n="NI"/>As soon as the king heard this story he said his own
<div n="lb"/>story to the Vaiśya. The Vaiśya continued. “Oh!
<div n="lb"/>Still, my mind is troubled. I am worried about my
<div n="lb"/>wife and children. They will be put to much difficulty
<div n="lb"/>if I am not there to look after them. Who is there to
<div n="lb"/>support them without me? All the children are lean.
<div n="lb"/>My wife also is likewise, lean. They are all always
<div n="lb"/>ill. What will they do without me? While I think of
<div n="lb"/>all these things I have no peace of mind at all.”
<div n="NI"/>Suratha: “What a fool are you! You yourself have
<div n="lb"/>said that all your children are wicked and cruel.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover they and their mother joining together had
[Page676-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>been trying to murder you. Why do you feel so
<div n="lb"/>miserable about such a wife and children?”
<div n="NI"/>When the King had finished saying thus much,
<div n="lb"/>Sumedhas came there. To remove the darkness of
<div n="lb"/>illusion from their minds, the hermit taught them the
<div n="lb"/>Nine-lettered Mantra (spell) with prayer and medi-
<div n="lb"/>tation. Thus giving them the mantra, the teacher
<div n="lb"/>hermit advised them to go to the bank of the river and
<div n="lb"/>select a suitable place and worship Devī with devotion
<div n="lb"/>and concentration of mind. Accordingly they went to
<div n="lb"/>the bank of the river and selected a pure and solitary
<div n="lb"/>place, and concentrating their minds on Devī, began
<div n="lb"/>to meditate and worship her taking only very little
<div n="lb"/>food. Thus engaged in deep meditation they spent two
<div n="lb"/>years. One day in a dream Devī appeared to them.
<div n="lb"/>She was clad in red clothes, and wore beautiful
<div n="lb"/>ornaments. They were full of joy on seeing the goddess.
<div n="lb"/>The third year of the penance was over. But Devī did
<div n="lb"/>not appear directly before them. In the third year
<div n="lb"/>they took only water. They finished the fourth year
<div n="lb"/>without seeing the goddess. They decided to do severe
<div n="lb"/>penance. Their intention was to offer their bodies to
<div n="lb"/>Devī. So they made a triangular cavity, with three
<div n="lb"/>parts each having an extension of 1½ ft. and made
<div n="lb"/>the walls of the cavity firm and kindled a large fire in
<div n="lb"/>it. The King and the Vaiśya began to cut pieces of
<div n="lb"/>flesh from their bodies and offered to Devī in the
<div n="lb"/>fire, and with the blood coming from the body they
<div n="lb"/>performed sacrifice to Devī. Instantly Devī appeared
<div n="lb"/>before them and asked them what boon they wanted.
<div n="lb"/>The King wanted to get his kingdom back. Devī
<div n="lb"/>said. “You return home. Your enemies shall leave the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom. Your ministers will fall at your feet and beg
<div n="lb"/>your pardon. You can rule over your country for ten
<div n="lb"/>thousand years. After that you will take rebirth as
<div n="lb"/>Sāvarṇi Manu, the son of the Sun.”
<div n="NI"/>What Samādhi Ceṭṭi wished was a life of self-renun-
<div n="lb"/>ciation. Devī gave him the wisdom and knowledge to
<div n="lb"/>renounce everything he had and to live a life of
<div n="lb"/>complete abstinence. Then Devī disappeared. The
<div n="lb"/>King returned to his kingdom and resumed his rule.
<div n="lb"/>Ceṭṭi renounced everything and wandered about
<div n="lb"/>immersed in meditation on Devī. (Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 5).
