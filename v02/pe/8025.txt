VARARUCI¦. An ancient Indian scholar in astronomy
<div n="lb"/>and astrology. (Some details regarding Vararuci are
<div n="lb"/>given under Bhartṛhari).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} It is stated in Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭha-
<div n="lb"/>lambaka, Taraṅga 1, that Vararuci was the rebirth of
<div n="lb"/>a Gaṇanāyaka (guard of Śiva) named Puṣpadanta.
<div n="lb"/>Once Śiva happened to tell Pārvatī some previous
<div n="lb"/>stories of the Vidyādharas. Puṣpadanta eavesdropped
<div n="lb"/>and heard everything. Pārvatī understood this and
<div n="lb"/>cursed him to become a man. Accordingly Puṣpadanta
<div n="lb"/>was born in the city of Kauśāmbī under the name
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci or Kātyāyana. (For details about the curse
<div n="lb"/>see under Guṇāḍhya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Of sharp intelligence.%} Vararuci was born as the son
<div n="lb"/>of the Brahmin Somadatta at Kauśāmbī. Agni-
<div n="lb"/>śikha was another name of Somadatta. Vasudattā
<div n="lb"/>was the mother of Vararuci. In the previous birth,
<div n="lb"/>Vasudattā was a hermit maid. Due to a curse she
<div n="lb"/>lost her hermit-maidhood and took birth as a woman
<div n="lb"/>under the name Vasudattā and became the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Somadatta.
<div n="NI"/>As his father died in his childhood, Vararuci was
<div n="lb"/>brought up by his mother. She was in great penury
<div n="lb"/>after the death of her husband. One day two travellers
<div n="lb"/>came to her house. While they were sitting on the
<div n="lb"/>veranda, the sound of a conch was heard. Then the
<div n="lb"/>mother called Vararuci and said to him. “Son, the
<div n="lb"/>dance of Nanda, the friend of your father, is about to
<div n="lb"/>begin.” Vararuci requested his mother to let him go
<div n="lb"/>to the temple and see the dance so that he might learn
<div n="lb"/>it. Hearing this, the guests were amazed. How can
<div n="lb"/>one learn dance by seeing only once? That was the
<div n="lb"/>doubt in the minds of the travellers. “Vararuci could
<div n="lb"/>learn anything by hearing only once,” his mother
<div n="lb"/>said. As a test, they recited to him a portion from the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas. Vararuci repeated the portion to them without
<div n="lb"/>any mistake. After this the guests took the boy and
[Page828-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>showed him the dance and brought him back. The boy
<div n="lb"/>performed every item of the dance he saw, before the
<div n="lb"/>guests. They were immensely pleased.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Getting a teacher.%} The guests had actually been
<div n="lb"/>searching for a boy who could understand anything at
<div n="lb"/>the first hearing. There was reason for it.
<div n="NI"/>In the great city of Nandarāja, there was a great
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin named Śaṅkarasvāmī. He had two sons
<div n="lb"/>named Varṣa and Upavarṣa. Both married and lived in
<div n="lb"/>separate houses. By and by Varṣa became cruel and
<div n="lb"/>wicked and poor. Upavarṣa became learned and
<div n="lb"/>wealthy. The rainy season approached. In those days
<div n="lb"/>it was a custom for women to make a sweet food of rice
<div n="lb"/>flour with sugar and give it to cruel Brahmins. It was
<div n="lb"/>to prevent the extreme cold in the winter and the ex-
<div n="lb"/>treme heat in the summer from affecting them severely.
<div n="lb"/>The wife of Upavarṣa made this sweet food and gave it
<div n="lb"/>to Varṣa. When he brought it home, his wife scolded
<div n="lb"/>him. Varṣa felt very sorry because of his foolishness.
<div n="lb"/>He gave up all his desires and began to worship
<div n="lb"/>Kumārasvāmī. Kumārasvāmī was pleased with him
<div n="lb"/>and blessed him with all kinds of knowledge. Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>svāmī had ordered him to teach all of this knowledge
<div n="lb"/>to one who could learn at first hearing. From that day
<div n="lb"/>onwards Varṣa had been waiting for a disciple who
<div n="lb"/>could learn at first hearing.
<div n="NI"/>During this period there lived two Brahmins named
<div n="lb"/>Devasvāmī and Karambhaka in the city of Vetasapura.
<div n="lb"/>They were friends. A son was born to each of them.
<div n="lb"/>The son of Devasvāmī was named Vyālī. The name of
<div n="lb"/>the son of Karambhaka was Indradatta. When Vyālī
<div n="lb"/>was a child, his father died. Seeing their grief the
<div n="lb"/>father of Indradatta left the country. Both of the boys,
<div n="lb"/>having nobody to look after them, went to perform
<div n="lb"/>penance, before Subrahmaṇyasvāmī. Subrahmaṇya
<div n="lb"/>ordered them in their sleep to go to Varṣa in Pāṭalikā,
<div n="lb"/>the city of King Nanda, and to learn every thing from
<div n="lb"/>him. The boys immediately went to the city of King
<div n="lb"/>Nanda and enquired about the teacher Varṣa. The
<div n="lb"/>people told them that Varṣa was a fool. They were
<div n="lb"/>sorry to hear it. Still they did not turn back. They
<div n="lb"/>reached the house of Varṣa, and entered the house which
<div n="lb"/>was the abode of rats and bats, the walls of which were
<div n="lb"/>crumbling due to rain as it had not been thatched for
<div n="lb"/>a long time. The courtyard was full of Cassiatora
<div n="lb"/>plants. Inside the house, here and there on the floor,
<div n="lb"/>Cyperus-grass was growing. The wife of Varṣa who was
<div n="lb"/>in utter penury stood up and welcomed them. She told
<div n="lb"/>them about her husband. “He is waiting for a disciple
<div n="lb"/>who would learn everything at first hearing.” Vyālī
<div n="lb"/>and Indradatta agreed to bring such a disciple and
<div n="lb"/>they started on a journey in search of such a boy. They
<div n="lb"/>were the two travellers who came to the house of
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci.
<div n="NI"/>Vyālī said all about these things to the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci. She was very glad and said. “Everything
<div n="lb"/>fits well. At the birth of my son, an ethereal
<div n="lb"/>voice said: “At first hearing he will learn every-
<div n="lb"/>thing. He will learn everything from the teacher
<div n="lb"/>Varṣa. He will publish works in grammar and astro-
<div n="lb"/>nomy.” If he has interest in good things he will get the
<div n="lb"/>name Vararuci. So I had been thinking how and where
<div n="lb"/>to find this teacher Varṣa.”
<div n="NI"/>Next morning, with the permission of his mother,
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci started for the house of Varṣa, with Vyālī and
[Page829-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>Indradatta. They reached the house of Varṣa. Next
<div n="lb"/>morning they smeared and purified the floor and the
<div n="lb"/>three sincere and simple disciples sat facing the east.
<div n="lb"/>The teacher Varṣa recited to them the divine spell
<div n="lb"/>‘Om,’ and instantly all the Vedas and the ancillaries of
<div n="lb"/>Vedas made their appearance. The teacher commenced
<div n="lb"/>teaching. The three disciples learned, Vararuci
<div n="lb"/>hearing only once, Vyālī hearing twice and Indradatta
<div n="lb"/>hearing thrice. Hearing these divine recitations and
<div n="lb"/>repetitions which were not to be heard anywhere else,
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins crowded to the place. King Nanda of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭalīputra praised the teacher Varṣa and sent him
<div n="lb"/>plenty of wealth and conferred on him ranks and
<div n="lb"/>privileges.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage.%} Vararuci learned everything from the
<div n="lb"/>teacher Varṣa. He went with his friends once to see
<div n="lb"/>the Indra-festival. There, Vararuci happened to see
<div n="lb"/>Upakośā the daughter of Upavarṣa and fell in love
<div n="lb"/>with her. That night he did not sleep. At last he slow-
<div n="lb"/>ly closed his eyes. A divine woman clad in white
<div n="lb"/>garments appeared before him It seemed to him that
<div n="lb"/>the woman said to him. “You need not worry in this
<div n="lb"/>matter. Upakośā was your wife in the previous birth.
<div n="lb"/>She will marry only you. I am Sarasvatī who pervades
<div n="lb"/>your body.” Vararuci woke up. Next day the elders
<div n="lb"/>came to know of this, and gave her in marriage to
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Vararuci becoming a Minister.%} Education was finished.
<div n="lb"/>It was time for Vyālī and Indradatta to give presents
<div n="lb"/>to the teacher Varṣa. The teacher demanded a crore
<div n="lb"/>of Vilkas (a Venetian ducat used for neck-ornament).
<div n="lb"/>They were not having so much wealth. They went
<div n="lb"/>with Vararuci to Nanda, the King of Ayodhyā, and the
<div n="lb"/>Brother-in-law of Vararuci. When they reached Ayodhyā,
<div n="lb"/>they heard that the King had just died. Indradatta
<div n="lb"/>said “By the practice of contemplation I shall enter the
<div n="lb"/>body of the King. Vararuci should come and beg money
<div n="lb"/>of me. Till my return Vyālī must keep my body.”
<div n="NI"/>“The spirit of Indradatta immediately entered the
<div n="lb"/>King's body. The dead King rose up. People were
<div n="lb"/>struck with wonder. They celebrated a festival. Vyālī
<div n="lb"/>kept the body of Indradatta within a temple. Vararuci
<div n="lb"/>went to the presence of the King and begged for a
<div n="lb"/>crore of Vilkas. The King called his minister Śakaṭāla
<div n="lb"/>and told him to give Vararuci a crore of Vilkas.
<div n="lb"/>Śakaṭāla, who was an intelligent man, felt some doubt
<div n="lb"/>in the coming to life of the King. He decided that some
<div n="lb"/>one might have entered the body of the King. He
<div n="lb"/>ordered that every dead body in the city should be
<div n="lb"/>burnt. Along with the bodies, the body of Indradatta
<div n="lb"/>also was taken by force from Vyālī. At this time the
<div n="lb"/>King compelled Śakaṭāla to give the beggar Vilkas.
<div n="lb"/>But till the dead bodies were burnt, Śakaṭāla did not
<div n="lb"/>obey him. Because his body was burnt Indradatta had
<div n="lb"/>to remain in the body of the King. Śakaṭāla gave Vara-
<div n="lb"/>ruci the required amount. But of what use was the
<div n="lb"/>money? Indradatta had become the King. The King
<div n="lb"/>and Vyālī made a secret consultation, as a result of
<div n="lb"/>which Vararuci was made the Prime Minister. Śakaṭāla
<div n="lb"/>was charged with Brahmahatyā and was put into a
<div n="lb"/>dungeon with his hundred sons. They were allowed
<div n="lb"/>fried and powdered grain and a ‘ceratu’ (a measure)
<div n="lb"/>of water as food for each.
<div n="NI"/>Śakaṭāla said to his sons. “My sons, all of us cannot
<div n="lb"/>live with so little food. The most intelligent one among
[Page829-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>us should live by eating the whole food, to take revenge
<div n="lb"/>on the Yoga Nanda King. Who will do so?”
<div n="NI"/>Sons:—We don't think that we are powerful to do that.
<div n="NI"/>So you must live, father!
<div n="NI"/>So Śakaṭāla ate the whole food and lived while his sons,
<div n="lb"/>one by one, died of hunger before his eyes. Śakaṭāla
<div n="lb"/>sat in the middle of the Skeletons with the sole purpose
<div n="lb"/>of taking revenge. Vyālī gave the present to the teacher
<div n="lb"/>and went home.
<div n="NI"/>Indradatta and Vararuci lived as king and minister.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Loss of ministership.%} By and by Indradatta had fallen
<div n="lb"/>into bad ways. The subjects were beset with famine.
<div n="lb"/>The people hated the king and the minister. They made
<div n="lb"/>a cry to bring Śakaṭāla back. They obtained the per-
<div n="lb"/>mission of the king and brought Śakaṭāla out of the
<div n="lb"/>dungeon. Śakaṭāla knew that so long as Vararuci was
<div n="lb"/>alive, he could do nothing to the King Yoga Nanda. So
<div n="lb"/>he decided to wait for an opportunity, and accepted
<div n="lb"/>an office under Vararuci. One day Yoga Nanda went
<div n="lb"/>out for a walk. He saw in the Ganges the palm of a
<div n="lb"/>hand with five fingers. He called Vararuci and asked
<div n="lb"/>him what the sight was. Vararuci showed two fingers
<div n="lb"/>in that direction. Immediately the palm of the hand
<div n="lb"/>disappeared. The King was amazed at this and asked
<div n="lb"/>him for its meaning. He said “The meaning of showing
<div n="lb"/>fingers was that if five men unite together, they could
<div n="lb"/>accomplish anything. I showed two fingers, to mean that
<div n="lb"/>if two men unite together they also could achieve any-
<div n="lb"/>thing.” At this reply the king was much pleased and
<div n="lb"/>Śakaṭāla felt miserable at the intelligence of Vararuci.
<div n="NI"/>On another occasion the King saw his wife looking at a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin guest through the window. He got angry and
<div n="lb"/>ordered that Brahmin to be killed. When that Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>was being taken to the scaffold, a dead fish, placed for
<div n="lb"/>sale, laughed loud. The king asked Vararuci for its
<div n="lb"/>reason. Saying that he had to consider about it before
<div n="lb"/>giving a reply, he went out and meditated upon Sara-
<div n="lb"/>svatī. Devī appeared and told him. “If you climb up to
<div n="lb"/>the top of this palm tree and sit there to night you will
<div n="lb"/>understand why the dead fish laughed.” Vararuci did
<div n="lb"/>as he was told. A fierce giantess came there with her
<div n="lb"/>young ones. The children began to ask her for food.
<div n="lb"/>The giantess told them that they would get the flesh of
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin next day, and that he was not killed that day
<div n="lb"/>because the dead fish had laughed. The young ones
<div n="lb"/>asked her why the dead fish laughed. The giantess said
<div n="lb"/>“The wives of the kings are not chaste. In all harems
<div n="lb"/>men live in the guise of women. Without stopping this
<div n="lb"/>the king was going to kill an innocent Brahmin. That
<div n="lb"/>is why the dead fish laughed.”
<div n="NI"/>Vararuci, who heard this conversation, got down when
<div n="lb"/>the giantess was gone. He went to the king and told
<div n="lb"/>him why the fish laughed. The king made a sudden
<div n="lb"/>search in the harem. He found out some men in the
<div n="lb"/>dress of women. The king honoured Vararuci and
<div n="lb"/>released the Brahmin. One day an artist who drew
<div n="lb"/>portraits, came to the palace. He drew a portrait of
<div n="lb"/>the king and the queen and placed it before the king.
<div n="lb"/>The picture was life-like. The king gave the artist
<div n="lb"/>several presents. Once Vararuci happened to enter the
<div n="lb"/>bed-room of the king. He saw the picture on the wall.
<div n="lb"/>The picture was beautiful. Still, considering the appear-
<div n="lb"/>ance of each part of her body the queen ought to have
<div n="lb"/>a mole on her loin. Vararuci put that mole in the
<div n="lb"/>picture. When Vararuci had gone the king entered the
[Page830-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>room and saw the mole in the picture. The king asked his
<div n="lb"/>servant, who that person was who had put that mole in
<div n="lb"/>the picture. He replied that it was Vararuci. The king
<div n="lb"/>thought that Vararuci had nocturnal connections with
<div n="lb"/>the queen. Perhaps it was in this way that Vararuci
<div n="lb"/>found out men in the dress of women. The king called
<div n="lb"/>Śakaṭāla to him and told him to kill Vararuci secretly.
<div n="lb"/>Śakaṭāla felt pity on Vararuci and hid him in a place.
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci told Śakaṭāla “No body can kill me. My
<div n="lb"/>friend is a giant. He will come to me the moment
<div n="lb"/>think of him. If I tell him he will swallow the whole
<div n="lb"/>world.” When he heard this, Śakaṭāla desired to see
<div n="lb"/>the giant. Vararuci thought of him and the giant
<div n="lb"/>appeared. Śakaṭāla was terribly afraid of the giant.
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci made him disappear. Śakaṭāla asked him how
<div n="lb"/>he got the friendship of the giant. Vararuci replied.
<div n="NI"/>“While you were in the dungeon, a city chief was disap-
<div n="lb"/>pearing daily from this city. The king asked me to find
<div n="lb"/>out the reason. One night, while I was walking through
<div n="lb"/>the city, I saw this giant. He asked me. “Who is the
<div n="lb"/>most beautiful woman in this city?” I replied “Whoever
<div n="lb"/>falls in love with a woman, to him, that woman is the
<div n="lb"/>most beautiful. You who do not know this principle,
<div n="lb"/>are a fool.” The giant had no answer. He said “You
<div n="lb"/>alone have defeated me. I am glad of it. The moment
<div n="lb"/>you think of me I will come and help you.” Saying
<div n="lb"/>this the giant disappeared. Thenceforward we became
<div n="lb"/>friends.”
<div n="NI"/>Śakaṭāla felt great respect for Vararuci. Hiraṇyagupta,
<div n="lb"/>the son of Yoga Nanda, went for hunting. His horse ran
<div n="lb"/>fast and he was separated from his army and got into
<div n="lb"/>a deep forest far away. He ate some fruits and plums
<div n="lb"/>and got on a tree to rest for the night. At that time a
<div n="lb"/>lion chased a bear, which climbed on the same tree.
<div n="lb"/>The prince trembled with fear. The bear said “Do not
<div n="lb"/>fear. I am your friend.” Both talked for a while and
<div n="lb"/>became fast friends. Shortly, the prince began to sleep.
<div n="lb"/>The lion asked the bear to push that man down. The
<div n="lb"/>bear said that he would not deceive his friend. The dis-
<div n="lb"/>appointed lion sat under the tree. Then the bear slept
<div n="lb"/>and Hiraṇyagupta sat awake. The lion asked the prince
<div n="lb"/>to push the bear down. Thinking that he could save
<div n="lb"/>his life by complying with the request of the lion, he
<div n="lb"/>pushed the bear down. Fortunately the hold of the bear
<div n="lb"/>was firm and so it did not fall. The bear cursed Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta. “May you become mad.” The king was very
<div n="lb"/>sorry when his son returned a mad man. The king
<div n="lb"/>repented that he had killed Vararuci. For this was the
<div n="lb"/>time when the king needed him most.
<div n="NI"/>Śakaṭāla went to the presence of the king and said that
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci was still alive. In accordance with the order
<div n="lb"/>of the king, Śakaṭāla brought Vararuci. The king
<div n="lb"/>showed him his mad son. By the blessing of Sarasvatī,
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci understood that the prince had deceived his
<div n="lb"/>friend, and informed the king of what had happened.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately the prince was cured of his madness. Yoga
<div n="lb"/>Nanda asked Vararuci, how he knew the cause of the
<div n="lb"/>madness of the prince. He replied. “A man of intelli-
<div n="lb"/>gence can understand anything by symptoms and in-
<div n="lb"/>ference.” He also said that in this way he knew about
<div n="lb"/>the mole of the queen. When the king heard this he
<div n="lb"/>bowed down his head.
<div n="NI"/>After this Vararuci left the palace. He did not stop to
<div n="lb"/>accept the favours of the king. Nor did he pay any heed
<div n="lb"/>to the compulsion of the king to stay. He reached his
[Page830-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>house. Everybody who saw Vararuci began to cry. Not
<div n="lb"/>knowing the reason, he stood dumbfounded. Upavarṣa
<div n="lb"/>came to him and said that when the news about the
<div n="lb"/>slaughter of Vararuci reached home, Upakośā got in-
<div n="lb"/>to fire and his mother died of broken heart. The grief-
<div n="lb"/>stricken Vararuci went to the forest for penance.
<div n="NI"/>After this Śakaṭāla waited for an opportunity to bring
<div n="lb"/>Indradatta (Yoga Nanda) down. Once he had been
<div n="lb"/>walking out side the city when he saw a Brahmin dig-
<div n="lb"/>ging a pit. Śakaṭāla asked him why he was digging the
<div n="lb"/>pit. He replied “I stumbled on this Darbha grass. So
<div n="lb"/>I am rooting it out.” Śakaṭāla resolved to make use of
<div n="lb"/>this Brahmin to achieve his purpose. His name was
<div n="lb"/>Cāṇakya. Śakaṭāla took Cāṇakya to the palace. A
<div n="lb"/>ceremony of offerings to the manes was being conducted
<div n="lb"/>in the Palace. Another Brahmin named Subandhu
<div n="lb"/>also came there. The king ordered ‘agrabhojana’ (first
<div n="lb"/>meal) to be given to Subandhu. Cāṇakya trembled
<div n="lb"/>with fury. At that time his lock of hair was loosened.
<div n="lb"/>He took a vow that only after pacifying his anger by
<div n="lb"/>killing Yoga Nanda within seven days, would he tie up
<div n="lb"/>his lock. Cāṇakya began practising sorcery against the
<div n="lb"/>king. The king caught burning fever and died on the
<div n="lb"/>seventh day. Śakaṭāla killed Hiraṇyagupta. After this
<div n="lb"/>Sakaṭāla made Candragupta, the son of the real Nanda
<div n="lb"/>who died earlier, the king. Making Cāṇakya his minis-
<div n="lb"/>ter, Śakaṭāla went for penance.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Sons.%} See under Pākkanār.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The end.%} Vararuci began to perform penance in the
<div n="lb"/>Vindhya mountain. At that time a brahmin came to
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage of Vararuci. He informed Vararuci of
<div n="lb"/>the death of Yoga Nanda. Thinking about the littleness
<div n="lb"/>of the pleasures of the world, he began to walk through
<div n="lb"/>the Vindhya mountain when he saw the devil called
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇabhūti. Telling everything to the devil Kāṇabhūti,
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci started for Badaryāśrama to discard his body.
<div n="lb"/>On the way he saw a hermit who lived on water alone.
<div n="lb"/>In the meanwhile his finger was cut with the tip of
<div n="lb"/>Darbha grass and blood oozed from the wound. Vara-
<div n="lb"/>ruci, by his attainments, changed the blood into the
<div n="lb"/>juice of a pot-herb. The hermit cried out “Oh, I have
<div n="lb"/>become a man of attainments.” With a laugh
<div n="lb"/>Vararuci said “You have not yet overcome your egoism.
<div n="lb"/>I did so to test you. First of all you must overcome
<div n="lb"/>your egoism and become wise.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this Vararuci went to Badaryāśrama and
<div n="lb"/>reached there. He did penance there and Devī appear-
<div n="lb"/>ed. According to her advice he made a fire by contem-
<div n="lb"/>plation and burned his body in it. Then Vararuci
<div n="lb"/>became the old Puṣpadanta and went to the presence
<div n="lb"/>of Śiva.
