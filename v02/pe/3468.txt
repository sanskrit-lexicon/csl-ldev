KESARĪ¦. A forest King who lived in the Mahā Meru.
<div n="lb"/>While Kesarī was living in the Mahāmeru, Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>cursed a celestial maid named Mānagarvā and changed
<div n="lb"/>her into a female monkey. She became the wife of
<div n="lb"/>Kesarī, under the name Añjanā. For a long time the
<div n="lb"/>couple had no children. Añjaña worshipped Vāyu Bha-
<div n="lb"/>gavān (Wind-God) for a child.
<div n="NI"/>Once during this period the gods and hermits went
<div n="lb"/>to Parama Śiva and requested him to beget a son to
<div n="lb"/>help Mahāviṣṇu who was about to incarnate as Śrī
<div n="lb"/>Rāma to kill Rāvaṇa. Śiva and Pārvatī instantly took
<div n="lb"/>the form of monkeys and entered the forest for play.
<div n="lb"/>They having not returned for a long time the gods
<div n="lb"/>asked the wind-god to go in search of them. The wind
<div n="lb"/>god came in the form of a great storm and shook the
<div n="lb"/>whole of the forest. Still they did not come out. Pārvatī
<div n="lb"/>who was pregnant was ashamed to come out. With
<div n="lb"/>Śiva she got on an Aśoka tree and sat there. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>that tree alone standing motionless in the big storm
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu god approached the tree and looked up. Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī appeared before Vāyu. Pārvatī refused to take
<div n="lb"/>the foetus in the form of monkey to Kailāsa. As Śiva
<div n="lb"/>had instructed, Pārvatī gave the child in the womb to
<div n="lb"/>the wind-god. It was at this time that Añjanā had
<div n="lb"/>prayed to Vāyu for a child. Vāyu gave that child
<div n="lb"/>to Añjanā, who gave birth to it. That child was
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān. Thus Hanūmān got the names, Añjanāputra
<div n="lb"/>(son of Añjanā), Vāyuputra (son of Vāyu), Kesari-
<div n="lb"/>putra (Son of Kesarī) etc. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 417).
