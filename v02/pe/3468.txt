KESARĪ¦. A forest King who lived in the Mahā Meru.
While Kesarī was living in the Mahāmeru, Brahmā
cursed a celestial maid named Mānagarvā and changed
her into a female monkey. She became the wife of
Kesarī, under the name Añjanā. For a long time the
couple had no children. Añjaña worshipped Vāyu Bha-
gavān (Wind-God) for a child.
<div n="NI"/>Once during this period the gods and hermits went
to Parama Śiva and requested him to beget a son to
help Mahāviṣṇu who was about to incarnate as Śrī
Rāma to kill Rāvaṇa. Śiva and Pārvatī instantly took
the form of monkeys and entered the forest for play.
They having not returned for a long time the gods
asked the wind-god to go in search of them. The wind
god came in the form of a great storm and shook the
whole of the forest. Still they did not come out. Pārvatī
who was pregnant was ashamed to come out. With
Śiva she got on an Aśoka tree and sat there. Seeing
that tree alone standing motionless in the big storm
Vāyu god approached the tree and looked up. Śiva and
Pārvatī appeared before Vāyu. Pārvatī refused to take
the foetus in the form of monkey to Kailāsa. As Śiva
had instructed, Pārvatī gave the child in the womb to
the wind-god. It was at this time that Añjanā had
prayed to Vāyu for a child. Vāyu gave that child
to Añjanā, who gave birth to it. That child was
Hanūmān. Thus Hanūmān got the names, Añjanāputra
(son of Añjanā), Vāyuputra (son of Vāyu), Kesari-
putra (Son of Kesarī) etc. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chap-
ter 417).
