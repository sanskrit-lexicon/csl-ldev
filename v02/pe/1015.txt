BHAKTI¦. A Devī born in Drāviḍa deśa (Southern
<div n="lb"/>India). Once Devī, along with her two sons, Jñāna
<div n="lb"/>and Vairāgya, started on a walking tour to Gokula and
<div n="lb"/>Vṛndāvana via Karṇāṭaka, Mahārāṣṭra and Gurjara
<div n="lb"/>(Gujarat). During the long tour the mother and her
<div n="lb"/>sons became aged. But, as soon as they set foot on
<div n="lb"/>Gokula and Vṛndāvana old age quitted Bhakti and
<div n="lb"/>she became young again. But, her sons remained old.
<div n="lb"/>So the mother requested Nārada to turn them young
<div n="lb"/>again. Nārada read out to them the Vedas, the
<div n="lb"/>Vedānta (Upaniṣads) and the Bhagavad Gītā, all to no
<div n="lb"/>purpose. Bhakti's sons still remained old. Then Sanaka,
<div n="lb"/>Sananda and Sanatkumāra asked Nārada to read out
<div n="lb"/>the Bhāgavata to them. Nārada did so, and the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Bhaktī Devī became young again. (Padma Purāṇa).
