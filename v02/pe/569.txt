AŚVAKṚTA¦. A river. Once a sage called Rcīka went to
Gādhi and asked for the hand of his daughter, Satya-
vatī, in marriage. He demanded as dowry a thousand
horses black in colour and with only one ear for each.
Ṛcīka prayed to Varuṇa and he gave him the horses
required. The river Aśvakṛta (created by horse) was
made by the flow of urine from these horses. (Chapter
57, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
