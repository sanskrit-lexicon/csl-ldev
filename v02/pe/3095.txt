KALAHĀ¦. Wife of a brāhmaṇa named Bhikṣu who was
<div n="lb"/>an inhabitant of the city of Saurāṣṭra. This woman
<div n="lb"/>used to do only just the opposite of what her husband
<div n="lb"/>asked her to do and so Bhikṣu kept it a rule to ask her
<div n="lb"/>to do the opposite of what he wanted her to do. But
<div n="lb"/>one day he asked her to float the śrāddha piṇḍa in the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā, and she threw it in Śaucyakūpa. As a
<div n="lb"/>result of that she was born in a demoniac womb. But
<div n="lb"/>Dharmadatta got her purified by the Dvādaśākṣarī
<div n="lb"/>mantra and giving her half the virtue accrued by him.
<div n="lb"/>By virtue of this they were reborn as Daśaratha and
<div n="lb"/>Kausalyā. (Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa, Sārakāṇḍa; Uttara-
<div n="lb"/>khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa). See also under Dharmadatta.
