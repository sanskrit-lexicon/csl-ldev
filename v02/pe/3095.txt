KALAHĀ¦. Wife of a brāhmaṇa named Bhikṣu who was
an inhabitant of the city of Saurāṣṭra. This woman
used to do only just the opposite of what her husband
asked her to do and so Bhikṣu kept it a rule to ask her
to do the opposite of what he wanted her to do. But
one day he asked her to float the śrāddha piṇḍa in the
river Gaṅgā, and she threw it in Śaucyakūpa. As a
result of that she was born in a demoniac womb. But
Dharmadatta got her purified by the Dvādaśākṣarī
mantra and giving her half the virtue accrued by him.
By virtue of this they were reborn as Daśaratha and
Kausalyā. (Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa, Sārakāṇḍa; Uttara-
khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa). See also under Dharmadatta.
