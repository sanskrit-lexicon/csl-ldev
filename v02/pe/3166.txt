<div n="lb"/>SAUDĀSA). A famous king of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
<div n="lb"/>He wandered about in the forest as a Rākṣasa for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Name.%} His actual name was Mitrasaha. Since he
<div n="lb"/>was the son of Sudāsa, he was called Saudāsa also.
[Page377-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 78). Kalmāṣāṅghri
<div n="lb"/>and Kalmāṣapāda were names which he got as a result
<div n="lb"/>of Vasiṣṭha's curse.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mitrasaha became a Rākṣasa.%} Mitrasaha was a re-
<div n="lb"/>puted and glorious king belonging to the solar dynasty
<div n="lb"/>of kings who ruled over Ayodhyā. He had a queen
<div n="lb"/>named Madayantī. While they were leading a happy
<div n="lb"/>and enviable married life, Mitrasaha was forced to
<div n="lb"/>lead the life of a Rākṣasa in the forest for a period of
<div n="lb"/>12 years, as the result of a curse. The story of this
<div n="lb"/>curse is given in different Purāṇas in different versions
<div n="lb"/>and they are given below;—
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śakti Cursed Mitrasaha.%} One day Mitrasaha went to
<div n="lb"/>the forest for hunting. Viśvāmitra wished to get this
<div n="lb"/>mighty King as his disciple. While the King was
<div n="lb"/>passing through the forest, he saw Śakti, Vasiṣṭha's son,
<div n="lb"/>coming towards him. The King was a Kṣatriya and
<div n="lb"/>Śakti was a Brāhmaṇa. They were faced with the
<div n="lb"/>problem of whether the Kṣatriya should make way for
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa or vice versa. Neither of them made way
<div n="lb"/>for the other. At last, Mitrasaha struck Sakti with his
<div n="lb"/>whip. In his anger Śakti cursed Mitrasaha that he
<div n="lb"/>should become a Rākṣasa and roam about in the forest
<div n="lb"/>for 16 years. Viśvāmitra who was standing nearby at
<div n="lb"/>the time introduced a devil into the body of the King
<div n="lb"/>and from that day Mitrasaha wandered about in the
<div n="lb"/>forest in the form of a Rākṣasa. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 176).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Vasiṣṭh cursed Mitrasaha.%} Mitrasaha once went to hunt
<div n="lb"/>in the forest. While hunting he came across two tiger
<div n="lb"/>cubs. Actually, they were two Rākṣasas in disguise.
<div n="lb"/>The King who was unaware of it, killed one of them
<div n="lb"/>with an arrow. The other cub suddenly assumed his
<div n="lb"/>own form as a Rākṣasa and after giving Mitrasaha a
<div n="lb"/>warning that he would take revenge on him at the
<div n="lb"/>proper time, vanished.
<div n="NI"/>After the hunt the King returned to his palace. He
<div n="lb"/>informed Vasiṣṭha that he wished to perform Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medhayāga like his ancestors. The sage offered to assist
<div n="lb"/>him in it. Shortly after, one day, the old Rākṣasa-tiger,
<div n="lb"/>disguising himself as the sage Vasiṣṭha, came to Mitra-
<div n="lb"/>saha and said;— “Oh King! I will tell you a secret.
<div n="lb"/>Don't tell anyone else. I have a great desire to eat
<div n="lb"/>meat food. Please send some cooked meat to my Āśrama
<div n="lb"/>without anyone knowing about it.” After saying this,
<div n="lb"/>the disguised Rākṣasa-sage left the place.
<div n="NI"/>The King told this secret to his wife Madayantī. They
<div n="lb"/>prepared the meat-food secretly and took it to Vasiṣṭha's
<div n="lb"/>Āśrama. When Vasiṣṭha saw the meat food, he took it
<div n="lb"/>as a personal insult and transformed the King into a
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Another story of Vasiṣṭha's curse on Mitrasah.%} Once
<div n="lb"/>while Mitrasaha was hunting in the forest, he happened
<div n="lb"/>to kill a Rākṣasa by accident. The dead Rākṣasa's
<div n="lb"/>younger brother swore to avenge his death. He went to
<div n="lb"/>the King in the disguise of a young Brāhmaṇa cook.
<div n="lb"/>Mitrasaha appointed him as a cook in the royal
<div n="lb"/>kitchen.
<div n="NI"/>At about that time, one day, Vasiṣṭha came to Ayodhyā,
<div n="lb"/>on the invitation of Mitrasaha for a Śrāddha. Mitra-
<div n="lb"/>saha, accompanied by his queen, greeted the sage with
<div n="lb"/>honour. He ordered the cook to prepare food for the
<div n="lb"/>guest at once. The Rāksasa disguised as cook, decided
<div n="lb"/>to make the best of this opportunity. In a short time
[Page377-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>he cooked some human flesh and offered it as food for
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. The enraged sage cursed the King to become
<div n="lb"/>a man-eating Rākṣasa who would roam about for twelve
<div n="lb"/>years in the woods. Thus Mitrasaha became a Rākṣasa.
<div n="lb"/>(Śiva Purāṇa, Śivarātri Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%How Mitrasaha got the name “Kalmāṣapāda.”%} Mitra-
<div n="lb"/>saha became very angry when he was cursed by
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. He decided to pay back in the same coin by
<div n="lb"/>cursing Vasiṣṭha also. He took water in his hand and
<div n="lb"/>was about to throw it down with the words of curse.
<div n="lb"/>But his queen Madayantī stopped him. She reminded
<div n="lb"/>him that it was not right to curse a Brāhmaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>requested him to sprinkle that water on his own feet.
<div n="lb"/>The King's anger cooled down and he sprinkled the
<div n="lb"/>water on his own feet. Since his feet were polluted by
<div n="lb"/>the water of sin Mitrasaha came to be called “Kalmā-
<div n="lb"/>ṣapāda”, and Kalmāṣāṅghri” from that day. (Śiva
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Śivarātri Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kalmāṣapāda's life as Rākṣasa.%} The curse-ridden
<div n="lb"/>Kanmāṣapāda began to look upon Vasiṣṭha and his
<div n="lb"/>sons with inveterate hatred. He roamed the country-
<div n="lb"/>sides and forests in the form of a Rākṣasa. He started
<div n="lb"/>man-eating by feeding upon Śakti, the eldest son of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. After that he ate all the remaining 99 sons
<div n="lb"/>of Vasiṣṭha. Distreseeḍ at the loss of his children,
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha left his Āsrama, bent on committing suicide.
<div n="lb"/>He tied his own hands and feet securely with a rope and
<div n="lb"/>jumped into the river to drown himself. This attempt,
<div n="lb"/>like several other attempts to commit suicide, failed
<div n="lb"/>and he did not die. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 177).
<div n="lb"/>In the Mahābhārata there is a story which says that
<div n="lb"/>once Uttaṅka, a disciple of the sage Gautama went to
<div n="lb"/>beg the Kuṇḍalas (ear ornaments) worn by Kanmāṣa-
<div n="lb"/>pāda's (Saudāsa's) queen, for the sake of Gautama's
<div n="lb"/>wife. (For details, see under the word “Uttaṅka”).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Brāhmaṇī's curse on Kalmāṣapāda.%} In the course of
<div n="lb"/>his wanderings through the forest as a Rākṣasa, Kalmā-
<div n="lb"/>ṣapāda happened to come across a Brāhmaṇa youth
<div n="lb"/>engaged in amorous pleasures with his wife Āṅgirasī.
<div n="lb"/>The King caught hold of the youth and killed him. His
<div n="lb"/>wife, the Brāhmaṇī wept loudly and after cremating her
<div n="lb"/>husband's body in a funeral pyre, jumped into it and
<div n="lb"/>burnt herself to death. Just before her death she pro-
<div n="lb"/>nounced a curse on Kalmāṣapāda that if he touched
<div n="lb"/>any woman in future he would die immediately.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of the Brāhmaṇa couple, the sin of
<div n="lb"/>Brahmahatyā (killing of Brāhmaṇa) continued to pur-
<div n="lb"/>sue Kalmāṣapāda in the form of a terrible monster.
<div n="lb"/>He fled for life from it and at last reached the pre-
<div n="lb"/>sence of King Janaka. There, he happened to see the
<div n="lb"/>sage Gautama who taught Kalmāṣapāda Divyajñana
<div n="lb"/>(Divine wisdom). As advised by the sage, he went to
<div n="lb"/>the temple at Gokarṇa and spent some years in deep
<div n="lb"/>meditation. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śivarātri Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Śāpamokṣa. (Liberation from Curse).%} Towards the
<div n="lb"/>close of the twelve years which Mitrasha (Kalmāṣa-
<div n="lb"/>pāda) spent as a Rākṣasa, Vasiṣṭha saw him. The sage
<div n="lb"/>sprinkled holy water on Mitrasha and at once the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasa (the spirit of the Rākṣasa) left his body and he
<div n="lb"/>resumed his original figure of the King. He accepted
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha as his preceptor. They went back together to
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>Although Madayantī, queen of Mitrasaha was there, the
<div n="lb"/>King was not able to touch her owing to the Brāhmaṇī's
[Page378-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>curse. So he requested Vasiṣṭha to beget children by
<div n="lb"/>her. Accordingly Madayantī became pregnant by
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha. But she did not deliver the child even after
<div n="lb"/>twelve years. At last she hit the embryo in her womb
<div n="lb"/>with a stone and the child was born. Since he was born
<div n="lb"/>with the help of a stone (Aśman), the child was named
<div n="lb"/>“A maka”. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 167).
