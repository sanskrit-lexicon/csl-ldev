HARITĀŚVA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A King born in the solar dynasty. In the
<div n="lb"/>art of music he defeated Nārada and shamed Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>(Goddess of language), pleased Brahmā and by the
<div n="lb"/>melody of his music sent Viṣṇu to sleep. The mounting
<div n="lb"/>achievements of the King in the art of music evoked
<div n="lb"/>jealousy in Śivaśaṅkara, the lord of music. When
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkaramūrti in a competitive spirit played the rāga
<div n="lb"/>Śaṅkarābharaṇa (a particular tune) Haritāśva) pointed
<div n="lb"/>out that Śāntarasa (the calmness and poise) which was
<div n="lb"/>suited to that rāga had given place to raudra rasa
<div n="lb"/>which was a serious mistake. Enraged at this Śiva
<div n="lb"/>opened his eye of fire at the King who retorted boldly
<div n="lb"/>thus, ‘even if the eye of fire was opened a mistake was a
<div n="lb"/>mistake’. This stand of the King pleased Śiva so much
<div n="lb"/>that he bestowed on the King boons and good wishes
<div n="lb"/>as presents for his (king's) victory over all.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Killed Andhaka.%} Andhakāsura conquered Svarga
<div n="lb"/>and took Indra prisoner during the period when Hari-
<div n="lb"/>tāśva was King. The combined efforts of Brahmā, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and Śiva could not kill Andhaka. At last at the ins-
<div n="lb"/>tance of Bṛhaspati a representative of the Devas visited
<div n="lb"/>Haritāśva at Ayodhyā and sought his help to kill Andh-
<div n="lb"/>aka and accordingly the King set out for war against
<div n="lb"/>the demon. Agastya told the King in secret that Andh-
<div n="lb"/>aka treasured an image of Śiva and Pārvatī in his
<div n="lb"/>stomach, and after removing, with his arrows the idol
<div n="lb"/>from his stomach, Haritāśva killed him and restored
[Page310-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the Deva-loka to Indra. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
