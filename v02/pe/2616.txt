HARITĀŚVA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A King born in the solar dynasty. In the
art of music he defeated Nārada and shamed Sarasvatī
(Goddess of language), pleased Brahmā and by the
melody of his music sent Viṣṇu to sleep. The mounting
achievements of the King in the art of music evoked
jealousy in Śivaśaṅkara, the lord of music. When
Śaṅkaramūrti in a competitive spirit played the rāga
Śaṅkarābharaṇa (a particular tune) Haritāśva) pointed
out that Śāntarasa (the calmness and poise) which was
suited to that rāga had given place to raudra rasa
which was a serious mistake. Enraged at this Śiva
opened his eye of fire at the King who retorted boldly
thus, ‘even if the eye of fire was opened a mistake was a
mistake’. This stand of the King pleased Śiva so much
that he bestowed on the King boons and good wishes
as presents for his (king's) victory over all.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Killed Andhaka.%} Andhakāsura conquered Svarga
and took Indra prisoner during the period when Hari-
tāśva was King. The combined efforts of Brahmā, Viṣṇu
and Śiva could not kill Andhaka. At last at the ins-
tance of Bṛhaspati a representative of the Devas visited
Haritāśva at Ayodhyā and sought his help to kill Andh-
aka and accordingly the King set out for war against
the demon. Agastya told the King in secret that Andh-
aka treasured an image of Śiva and Pārvatī in his
stomach, and after removing, with his arrows the idol
from his stomach, Haritāśva killed him and restored
[Page310-b+ 65]
the Deva-loka to Indra. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
Kāṇḍa).
