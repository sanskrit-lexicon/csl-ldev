MĀMĀṄKAM¦. Māmāṅkam was a very important national
<div n="lb"/>festival of Kerala. This festival used to be conducted on
<div n="lb"/>the sandy beach of Tirunāvāya. It represented the crown-
<div n="lb"/>ing ceremony of the sovereign of Kerala. There used to
<div n="lb"/>be a grand assembly of all the artistes of Kerala. There
<div n="lb"/>was an exhibition of the arts, trade and commerce of
<div n="lb"/>the land attracting a huge crowd of people from differ-
<div n="lb"/>ent parts of Bhārata. Scholars believe that the word
<div n="lb"/>Māmāṅkam is derived from the Sanskrit word “Mahā-
[Page473-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>maghā”. Some say that it was so called because it was
<div n="lb"/>conducted on the day of Maghā in the month of
<div n="lb"/>Māgha.
<div n="NI"/>The festival was conducted under the auspices of the
<div n="lb"/>supreme power in Malabar. For a long period Peru-
<div n="lb"/>māls were in power in Malabar and so Māmāṅkam was
<div n="lb"/>conducted under the control of the Perumāls. The last
<div n="lb"/>of the line of Perumāls handed over the right to the
<div n="lb"/>then mighty chief, the King of Valluvanāḍ and for
<div n="lb"/>several years Māmāṅkam was conducted under his aus-
<div n="lb"/>pices. The foreign traders who came to Malabar, the
<div n="lb"/>Mohammadans and the Portuguese, persuaded Sāmūtiri
<div n="lb"/>(zamorin) to take control of this festival and with the
<div n="lb"/>help of the foreigners Sāmūtiri wrested from the King
<div n="lb"/>of Valluvanāḍ the right of conducting the Māmāṅkam.
<div n="lb"/>After some time the King. of Valluvanāḍ made an
<div n="lb"/>attempt to get back the right from Sāmūtiri. This
<div n="lb"/>enraged Sāmūtiri and there ensued a fight between
<div n="lb"/>them resulting in much shedding of blood. An agree-
<div n="lb"/>ment was reached that after twelve years each would
<div n="lb"/>relinquish the right in favour of the other. So after
<div n="lb"/>twelve years Sāmūtiri was compelled to relinquish his
<div n="lb"/>right but by resorting to many sly tactics he retained
<div n="lb"/>the right. The strength of Sāmūtiri increased and he
<div n="lb"/>became a great power in Malabar. He was bold enough
<div n="lb"/>to send away the Portuguese from the coast and
<div n="lb"/>Sāmūtiri maintained his position till the advent of
<div n="lb"/>Tippu Sultan to Malabar in the year 1788 A.D. Every
<div n="lb"/>twelve years Sāmūtiri had to show his might to retain
<div n="lb"/>the right of the Māmāṅkam and those days of exhibit-
<div n="lb"/>ing strength were ghastly.
<div n="NI"/>The place of this Māmāṅkam was at Tirunāvāya in Tirūr
<div n="lb"/>taluk. A Śiva temple of historic fame stands on the
<div n="lb"/>shores of the river Bhārata flowing through Tirūr taluk.
<div n="NI"/>There was an expansive sand beach on its shores,
<div n="lb"/>become famous by being the scene of many socio-politi-
<div n="lb"/>cal events there. It was the venue of the mighty
<div n="lb"/>Nambūdiris of Malabar to discuss matters of socio-
<div n="lb"/>political importance. Every year on the full-moon day
<div n="lb"/>in the month of Māgha all the ruling chiefs of Kerala
<div n="lb"/>would assemble there and on a special dais there
<div n="lb"/>Sāmūtiri would sit with royal robes and a sword in his
<div n="lb"/>right hand presiding over the assembly. The sword was
<div n="lb"/>given to the Sāmūtiris by Ceramān Perumāl and was
<div n="lb"/>considered the symbol of undisputed sovereignty of
<div n="lb"/>Kerala. It was also a sanction to conduct the Māmāṅ-
<div n="lb"/>kam. The Sāmūtiris came prepared to give a fight if their
<div n="lb"/>authority was challenged by anybody. The ruling
<div n="lb"/>Sāmūtiri would send an invitation to all chiefs of
<div n="lb"/>Kerala. On either side of Sāmūtiri would sit the rela-
<div n="lb"/>tives and friends of Sāmūtiri. There would be an army
<div n="lb"/>of Nairs and Tiyyas ready outside and only after
<div n="lb"/>defeating them could anybody approach the dais of
<div n="lb"/>Sāmūtiri. The dais was called Nilapāṭṭutara.
<div n="NI"/>The whole atmosphere would resound with drummings
<div n="lb"/>and shots from pop-guns. Majestic elephants adorned
<div n="lb"/>with golden headdresses would be arrayed there. The
<div n="lb"/>conference of the chiefs would last for twelve days and
<div n="lb"/>the festival for twentyfour days. The Māmāṅkam attract-
<div n="lb"/>ed a huge crowd from far and wide because there were
<div n="lb"/>then many items of interest and information. The
<div n="lb"/>Māmāṅkam commenced on a fixed day at an auspicious
<div n="lb"/>hour in the morning when the caparisoned elephants
<div n="lb"/>started moving to the accompaniment of drums and
<div n="lb"/>pipes. The last Māmāṅkam was in 1755 A.D. By the
[Page474-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>time of Mārttaṇḍa Varmā the centre of power shifted
<div n="lb"/>from Malabar to the south. Even today the memories
<div n="lb"/>of the same are brightening spots in the history of
<div n="lb"/>Malabar.
