DHARMAVYĀDHA¦. Though he was born in the caste
<div n="lb"/>of foresters he became a saint by following the path of
<div n="lb"/>duty and righteousness. In his previous birth he was a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin. He was a friend of a king who was an adept
<div n="lb"/>in archery. Once both went on hunting expedition to the
<div n="lb"/>forest. The brahmin sent an arrow at a wild animal but
<div n="lb"/>the arrow went and struck a sage who was doing
<div n="lb"/>penance under a tree. When the sage was rolling on the
<div n="lb"/>arrow he said: “Oh, evil-natured Brāhmaṇa, may you
<div n="lb"/>be born as a hunter selling flesh in your next life.” The
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin went and apologised to the sage and craved
<div n="lb"/>for pardon. Taking pity on him the sage consoled him
<div n="lb"/>by saying that though he would be born as such, he
<div n="lb"/>would be a great scholar and attain mokṣa by doing his
<div n="lb"/>duty without even once wavering from it.
<div n="NI"/>The Brahmin was born a hunter in the country of
<div n="lb"/>Mithilā He took to looking after his parents as a vow
<div n="lb"/>and soon became a top-ranking righteous man. He did
<div n="lb"/>his duty to which he was born. He sold meat and
<div n="lb"/>earned a living. He never killed or butchered an animal.
<div n="lb"/>One day a Brahmin named Kauśika was doing penance
<div n="lb"/>sitting under a tree when a crane perched on the top
<div n="lb"/>of its branches defiled the Brahmin's head with its
<div n="lb"/>droppings. The Brahmin in rage looked up and his
<div n="lb"/>powerful stare burnt the crane and it fell down dead.
<div n="lb"/>Leaving that place some time later he went to a house
<div n="lb"/>to beg. The house-wife informed him that he would be
<div n="lb"/>given alms only after attending to her husband. The
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin was not pleased with her reply. Seeing that she
<div n="lb"/>added “Please do not look at me like that. I am no
<div n="lb"/>crane. To me my husband is supreme.”
<div n="NI"/>The Brahmin was taken aback when he heard the lady
<div n="lb"/>mention the incident of the crane. The lady explained
<div n="lb"/>to him that all her powers were due to her devotion to
<div n="lb"/>her husband and advised the Brahmin to go and meet
<div n="lb"/>Dharmavyādha of Mithilā to remove the egoism in him.
<div n="lb"/>Obeying her instructions Kauśika went and accepted
<div n="lb"/>Dharmavyādha as his guru. The learned hunter then
<div n="lb"/>spoke to Kauśika about Varṇadharmas, Śiṣṭācāras,
<div n="lb"/>hiṃsā and ahiṃsā, Mīmāṃsā relating to dharma and
<div n="lb"/>karma, the importance and glory of Brahmavidyā, the
<div n="lb"/>significance of the control of the senses, Triguṇas, Prāṇa-
<div n="lb"/>vāyu, service to father and mother and many such
<div n="lb"/>other things. The egoism of Kauśika was removed and
<div n="lb"/>he returned home. Devoted to his parents he attained
<div n="lb"/>heaven. (Chapters 27 to 33, Vana Parva).
