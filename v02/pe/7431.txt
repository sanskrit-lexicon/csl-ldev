ŚVETAKETU¦. A Maharṣi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Śvetaketu was the son of the sage Āruṇi or
Uddālaka who was born in the Gautama clan. Śveta-
ketu had a sister named Sujātā. Aṣṭāvakra was her son
by the sage, Kahoṭaka. Thus Śvetaketu was Aṣṭāvakra's
uncle. Śvetaketu and Aṣṭāvakra grew up together in
Uddālaka's āśrama. (See under Aṣṭāvakra).

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pride perishes.%} Under his father's training Śveta-
ketu became a great scholar. With the increase in his
scholarship, he became very proud. The father who
understood this called him to his side and asked him:-
“By studying all about what you can see, hear and
understand, have you learnt anything about what you
cannot see, hear or understand?” Śvetaketu admitted
that he did not know. Then Uddālaka explained to
him the mystery of Paramātmā (universal soul) which
is without beginning or end. (Chāndogyopaniṣad).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śvetaketu in Pāñcāla.%} After completing his education
under his father, Śvetaketu went to Pāñcāla. There, in
the royal assembly Jaivali, the Pravāhaṇa King asked
him the following questions:—“Where do people go
from this world? How do they return? Where do
Devayāna and Pitṛyāna meet? From where do they
diverge? Why is Pitṛloka imperfect? What is the fifth
yajñabali?”
<div n="NI"/>Śvetaketu answered that he did not know because his
father had not taught him these things. Then he went
to his father Āruṇi and told him about his failure to
answer these questions. The father admitted that he
too did not know them and suggested that they should
ask Pravāhaṇa himself. Since Śvetaketu refused to go
with him to see the King, Uddālaka himself went to
Prāvahaṇa. The King enlightened him on the above
topics and sent him back. (Chāndogyopaniṣad 1. 8).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ācārya of Yajña Rules.%} In Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,
Śvetaketu is described as the Ācārya of the rules of
Yajña. He has laid down definite rules and procedures
for priests officiating in Yajñas. Besides, he has suggested
the different customs and practices to be observed by
Brahmacārins and tapasvins. In the treatises dealing with
Dharmaśāstra before his time, food of sweet taste was
denied to Brahmacārins. But Śvetaketu has pointed
out that it was an entirely wrong doctrine. (Gopatha
Brāhmaṇa, 1. 33; Sāṃkhyāyana Brāhmaṇa, 1. 33).
<div n="NI"/>Once an ācārya named Jātūkaṛṇya became the priest
of the Kings of Kāśī, Kosala and Videha. Śvetaketu
who was angry at this complained bitterly about this
to his father. Then Uddālaka reminded his son that
priests should yearn for wisdom instead of being
attracted by worldly pleasures.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Author of Kāmaśāstra.%} It is more or less clear that
it was Śvetaketu who abridged the original work on
Kāmaśāstra by Nandi, into 500 chapters. This abridge-
ment of Śvetaketu was again abridged after some years
by Bābhravya. It was after abridging it again and
adding Dattakācārya's “Vaiśika” and Suvarṇanābha's
“Sāmprayogika” etc., that Vātsyāyana composed his
famous treatise “Kāmasūtra”. Really speaking, the
basis of Vātsyāyana's “Kāmasūtra” was the works of
Bābhravya and Śvetaketu on Kāmaśāstra.
<div n="NI"/>It has been observed that the first person who raised
his voice against the evils of drinking and adultery by
the Brāhmaṇa community was Śvetaketu. There is a
story in the Mahābhārata about the fact which prompt-
ed him to bring marriage within the framework of law.
Śvetaketu was Uddālaka's son, born to his wife by one
of his disciples. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 35, Verse
22). Once his mother was abducted by a Brāhmaṇa.
This incident inspired him to make stringent laws
insisting on monogamy for men and women.
