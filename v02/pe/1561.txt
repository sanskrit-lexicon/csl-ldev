CITRAKETU I¦. An emperor, who remained childless
for a long time. At last a son was born to him owing to
[Page184-b+ 65]
the blessings of Sage Aṅgiras. But, ere long the child was
dead and gone, and its parents, immersed in sorrow
took the dead child to Aṅgiras. Nārada also happened
to be there on the occasion. Aṅgiras restored the dead
child to life and asked him to live with the parents.
The boy immediately stood up and told Aṅgiras that
he had many parents in his many previous lives, and
requested to be enlightened as to which of those parents
he was to live with. Brahmā and Nārada felt confused.
In the end they disappeared after imparting spiritual
wisdom to Citraketu. And, Citraketu, who, for eight
days immersed himself in concentrating the mind on
God was turned into a Gandharva; his wife too turned
Gandharva.
<div n="NI"/>And, both of them rose up in the sky and flying over
Mount Kailāsa looked down to the mountain. There they
saw Pārvatī being seated on the thighs of Śiva at which
sight Citraketu laughed. Enraged by the laughter
Pārvatī cursed him to be born as an asura, and he was
born as such. Vṛtrāsura was Citraketu born as asura.
