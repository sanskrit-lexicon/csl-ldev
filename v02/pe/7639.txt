TURVĪTI II¦. A King. But since in some places he is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as a sage, it must be presumed that he must
<div n="lb"/>have been a King who had become a sannyāsin during
<div n="lb"/>the latter part of his life. Once this sage was drowned
<div n="lb"/>and Indra came in time and rescued him. (Sūkta 61,
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
