DEVAŚARMĀ IV¦. The hero of a story told by Viṣṇu-
śarman.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇuśarman, the intelligent preceptor, told five stories
based on five tactics to educate the five dull sons of
emperor Sudarśana. The fifth tactics is called asaṃprek-
ṣyakāritva. He told two important stories to illustrate
the dangers, which would happen to those who act in
haste and in anger, without patiently attempting to
find out the truth. Devaśarman is the hero of one of
the stories.
<div n="NI"/>{%Story one.%} Once upon a time there lived in Gauḍadeśa
[Page213-a+ 65]
a brahmin called Devaśarman with his wife Yajñasenā.
When his wife got pregnant Devaśarman told her that a
good and lucky son would be born to them to which she
replied as follows:—“On no account build castles in
the air and brood over things. I shall tell you a story
about a danger which happened to one who built
castles in the air. A brahmacārī was carrying home in
a pot on his head some rice flour. On the way he
thought thus: “I will purchase a she-goat with the
money I get out of the sale of this rice powder, and
it will deliver two kids every year. I will sell all the
kids and with the sale proceeds purchase a cow and
when it multiplies I will have the wherewithals for cul-
tivation and then I will do cultivation in a good field
and produce much paddy. And when I have thus money
in hand I will renovate my house and marry. We will
then have a good son whom I will name Somaśarman,
and if my wife, without caring for the boy, goes to milk
the cow I will go to the cow shed and give her a good
beating. “When his imagination reached this point the
pot on his head received, without his knowing, a blow
with the stick in his hand and it fell down on the ground
and was broken to pieces.”
<div n="NI"/>Five or six days after telling the above story to her
husband Yajñasenā gave birth to a child. One day she
went to the river to take her bath leaving the child
to the care of her husband. Soon after a messenger came
from the palace to invite Devaśarman for food, the day
being Amāvasī when Brahmins were fed well and also
given dakṣiṇā, (presents of money). He could not wait
till his wife arrived; the child became a problem to
him.
<div n="NI"/>The brahmin had a beloved Mongoose. After entrusting
the child to the care of it the Brahmin went to the
palace. Within a short time a serpent was seen crawling
towards the child and the Mongoose attacked it and
bit it into pieces. Naturally the Mongoose got itself
smeared all over with the blood of the serpent, and the
brahmin on returning home finding the Mongoose bath-
ed in blood thought it might have eaten the child
and in a rage he killed the poor Mongoose. But, when
he entered the room and found pieces of the killed ser-
pent strayed all over there truth and light dawned on
him. Yajñasenā, who had returned after bath by now
also found fault with him.
<div n="NI"/>{%The second story.%} Once there was a Brahmin in very indi-
gent circumstances. He was an orphan from his very
childhood. One day while he was asleep quite weary
and tired as he had no food that day some one
appeared and told him in a dream that three sannyāsins
would come to his house that noon and that if beaten to
death they would turn into three pot-fulls of treasure
with which he could live comfortably well.
<div n="NI"/>His dream came true, and he locked up the treasure in
his room after sending away a barber who had witnessed
the incident with a piece of gold. The barber returned
home cherishing in his mind the false belief that sann-
yāsins beaten to death would turn into pot-fulls of
treasure. And, one day some sannyāsins came to his
house and he began beating them and they ran out
crying aloud. Their cries attracted the attention of the
servants of the King. The barber's limbs were cut off
and he was killed on Śūla (a three-pronged weapon).
