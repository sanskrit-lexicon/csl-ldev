MOKṢA II¦.
<F>1) Jīvātmā = The individual soul enshrined in the human body imparting to it life, motion and sensation as opposed to Paramātmā.
Paramātmā = The Supreme spirit or Brahman
Saṃsāra = The circuit of life consisting of births and rebirths with sufferings and enjoyments of woes and happiness.</F> Mokṣa means liberation and is generally
meant to convey the meaning of the deliverance of the
soul from recurring births. The Jīvātmā enshrined in
the body has the delusion that it enjoys or suffers happi-
ness or woe. In truth it neither suffers nor enjoys anything.
It is detached from all. It is the Supreme Being (Para-
brahman). When Jīvātmā deserts its woes it gets mokṣa
i.e. Jīvātmā gets merged with Paramātmā. When once
Jīvātmā merges with Paramātmā, Jīvātmā is devoid
of happiness or woes. It need not be enshrined in any
body. A Jīvātmā getting released from one body joins
another new body and thus a Jīvātmā in succession
enters thousands of bodies and each time without know-
ing the absolute Truth laments over its woes. In the
words of a Ṛṣi it is explained thus: “Jīvātmā, which is
bliss in itself living in births after births searches for
bliss elsewhere just as a person wearing a golden neck-
lace round his neck searches for the same elsewhere.”
The passage of Jīvātmā from one birth to another and
the bodies that enshrine it each time constitutes the
worldly life. When once a Jīvātmā thus involved
in Saṃsāra (mundane existence) gets real knowledge,
the knowledge that Jīvātmā and Paramātmā are one
and the same, then that Jīvātmā gets final emancipa-
tion, liberation from recurring births. It merges with
Brahman. This is called Mokṣa.
