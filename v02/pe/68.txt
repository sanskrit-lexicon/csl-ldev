AGNIPRAVEŚA¦(M). Entering fire. In the Yuddha-
Kāṇḍā of the Rāmāyaṇa, Vālmīki has described Sītā's
entering and standing in fire (Agnipraveśam) as a
test of her purity. Though Rāma recovered Sītā from
Rāvaṇa, he wanted to accept her as his wife only after
her purity had been tested and proved. So he decided to
test her by fire (Agniparīkṣaṇa). Sītā shed tears at the
thought that her husband doubted her chastity.
Lakṣmaṇa, at Rāma's bidding, made a pyre. Sītā
jumped into it after praying to the gods. She remained
unscorched by the fire and Rāma gladly received her
once more as his wife.
