MADRA¦ (M). An ancient place of habitation in Bhārata.
This is situated near the river Jhelum. Mādrī,
the wife of Pāṇḍu was a princess of this place. Bhīṣma
went to Madra and brought Mādrī for Pāṇḍu. (Chapter
112, Ādi Parva). At the time of Arjuna's birth there
was a voice from heaven which said, “This child will
grow up and capture many countries like Madra”.
Aśvapati, father of Sāvitrī, was a king of Madra. Karṇa
condemned Madra and Vāhīka as countries which had
fallen low in virtue. (Chapter 44, Karṇa Parva).
