KUṬṬĀLA¦ (M). Seat of a famous Śiva temple in
South India, originally a Viṣṇu temple. There is a
story about its conversion into the present Śiva temple
as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Agastya, on his journey to the south, reached Tirukku-
tralam (Kuṭṭālam) in the Tirunelveli Zilla on the
southern borders of Tamil Nadu. The temple there was
dedicated to Viṣṇu, and the Vaiṣṇavas (devotees of
Viṣṇu) prevented Agastya from entering the temple
with ashes on his forehead. At once he transformed
himself into a devotee of Viṣṇu, and was permitted
entry into the temple. As Viṣṇu wanted to show the
[Page448-b+ 61]
world that he and Śiva were one and the same,
and also the greatness of Agastya, the idol of Viṣṇu
was all on a sudden changed into a Śiva Liṅga. Since
then the temple has remained a Śiva Temple.
(Skanda Purāṇa).
