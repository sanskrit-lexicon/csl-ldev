KAIṬABHA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Kaiṭabha was the brother of
<div n="lb"/>Madhu, an Asura (demon). These two brothers are
<div n="lb"/>known in the Purāṇas as Madhu-Kaiṭabhas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} In the Purāṇas, two stories slightly different
<div n="lb"/>from each other, occur about the birth of Madhu and
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha. One story occurs in Devī Bhāgavata,
<div n="lb"/>Skandha 10 and the other in Mahābhārata, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva. In Devī Purāṇa, Chapter 1, it is stated as
<div n="lb"/>follows:—
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning there was no earth or any other
<div n="lb"/>planet. There was only water. Mahāviṣṇu slept on the
<div n="lb"/>surface of the water. From the navel of Mahāviṣṇu the
<div n="lb"/>stalk of a lotus grew up and there was a lotus flower
<div n="lb"/>at the end of the stalk. Brahmā was born in the lotus
<div n="lb"/>flower. Brahmā stayed in the flower in deep meditation
<div n="lb"/>reciting the Vedas. Ear-wax flowed out from both the
<div n="lb"/>ears of Mahāviṣṇu. From the ear-wax two Asuras
<div n="lb"/>Madhu and Kaiṭabha were born.
<div n="NI"/>The following occurs in the Mahābhārata, Śānti
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 348 about the birth of Madhu-
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabhas.
<div n="NI"/>A lotus flower grew up from the navel of Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and Brahmā was born in the flower. In the flower there
<div n="lb"/>were two drops of water created by Mahāviṣṇu. One
<div n="lb"/>drop was as sweet as honey and from that drop was
<div n="lb"/>born the Asura Madhu with the attributes of tamas
[Page365-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>(darkness). The other drop was hard and from it
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha was born with the attribute of Rajas
<div n="lb"/>(activity).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Madhu-Kaiṭabhas’ acquiring boons.%} Madhu-Kaiṭabhas
<div n="lb"/>were born in water, grew up in water and walked on
<div n="lb"/>the surface of water, haughty and arrogant. They
<div n="lb"/>began to think about how the big flood of water came
<div n="lb"/>into existence. Then Devī appeared before them and
<div n="lb"/>taught them the mantra or incantation of Vāgbīja
<div n="lb"/>(origin of logos). Reciting this mantra, Madhu and
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha worshipped Devī for thousand years. Devī
<div n="lb"/>appeared and asked them what they wished. They
<div n="lb"/>wanted the boon that death should befall them only as
<div n="lb"/>they desired. Devī granted them the boon. After this
<div n="lb"/>they became haughtier because of the boon, and lived
<div n="lb"/>in the water playing with the creatures in water having
<div n="lb"/>nobody to confront them (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The theft of the Vedas.%} Madhu Kaiṭabhas saw
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā lying in the lotus flower reciting the four
<div n="lb"/>Vedas which he had created. They caught hold of all
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and went to Pātāla, (the nether world) and
<div n="lb"/>hid themselves there. Brahmā grew sad at the loss of
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and followed Madhu-Kaiṭabhas, who began
<div n="lb"/>to attack Brahmā. At this Brahmā became terribly
<div n="lb"/>afraid of the Asuras and ran to Mahāviṣṇu who was
<div n="lb"/>lying in a deep sleep of contemplation. Brahmā praised
<div n="lb"/>him. Mahāviṣṇu woke up. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha
<div n="lb"/>10).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The death of Madhu and Kaiṭabha.%} According to the
<div n="lb"/>request of Brahmā, Mahāviṣṇu confronted Madhu and
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha. Madhu engaged Viṣṇu in fighting while
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha took rest and when Madhu became tired,
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha engaged Viṣṇu in fighting. Thus the fight
<div n="lb"/>went on for a long time and Viṣṇu became tired of
<div n="lb"/>continuous fight. Viṣṇu understood that owing to the boon
<div n="lb"/>given by Devī the Asuras would die only if they wished
<div n="lb"/>for death, and that no body could kill them. So Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>began to meditate on Devī, who said “It would never
<div n="lb"/>be possible for you to kill Madhu and Kaiṭabha
<div n="lb"/>because of my boon. They could be killed only by
<div n="lb"/>deceit. So you may kill them deceitfully”.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing these words Mahāviṣṇu approached the Asuras
<div n="lb"/>and said to them. “I am much pleased with you. So
<div n="lb"/>you may ask for any boon.” Hearing this they laughed
<div n="lb"/>and said that they were more powerful than Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>and that he might ask of them any boon. Taking that
<div n="lb"/>opportunity Mahāviṣṇu said “Oh ! powerful persons.
<div n="lb"/>I ask you to grant me this boon. Give me the boon to
<div n="lb"/>kill you.” This request shook them. They were willing
<div n="lb"/>to be killed at any place except water. They thought
<div n="lb"/>that Viṣṇu would not be powerful enough to kill them.
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu instantly raised his thighs which were
<div n="lb"/>enlarged to a great extent over the water as solid earth
<div n="lb"/>seeing which the Asuras enlarged their bodies to the
<div n="lb"/>extent of a thousand yojanas. But Mahāviṣṇu enlarged
<div n="lb"/>his thighs further, caught hold of Madhu and Kaiṭa-
<div n="lb"/>bha, laid them on his thighs and cut off their heads
<div n="lb"/>with his discus. All the surface of the sea was covered
<div n="lb"/>with the medas (fat) of these Asuras. This medas of
<div n="lb"/>Madhu and Kaiṭabha collected itself into a lump and
<div n="lb"/>became the earth. So the earth got the name ‘Medinī’.
<div n="lb"/>As the earth was the fat of the Asuras it was not fit for
<div n="lb"/>food. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The so of Madhu-Kaiṭabhas.%} A horrible son named
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu was born to Madhu-Kaiṭabhas. He lived
[Page366-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>under the sand in a wilderness called Ujjālakam. A
<div n="lb"/>King of the Ikṣvāku family named Kuvalayāśva killed
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu. So Kuvalayāśva got the name Dhundhu-
<div n="lb"/>māra. See under Dhundhu. (Mahābhārata, Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 202). (Khara and Atikāya are the
<div n="lb"/>rebirths of Madhu and Kaiṭabha. See under Atikāya).
