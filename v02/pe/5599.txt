RAIBHYA IV¦. One of the sons of Brahmā. Once Raibhya
went with Vasu and Aṅgiras to Bṛhaspati and asked him
several questions, about the attainment of Supernal bliss.
Bṛhaspati replied that attainment of heaven could be
had, not by action but only by devotion. Raibhya
immediately started to Gayā to do penance. There
he met with the Sanatkumāras. (Varāha Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Urvaśī made an earnest effort to hinder the severe vow
and penance of Raibhya. But it was of no use, and by
his curse, that celestial woman became ugly. She
entreated him for liberation from the curse. Raibhya
blessed her and said that she could obtain her original
form by bathing in Yodhinīkuṇḍa. (Yoginī Kuṇḍa).
Urvaśī bathed in Yodhinīkuṇḍa and from that day
onwards that tīrtha (holy bath) came to be known as
Urvaśīyoginīkuṇḍa.
