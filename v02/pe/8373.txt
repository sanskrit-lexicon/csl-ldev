VINĀYAKACATURTHĪ¦. One of the important festivals
of the Hindus. This is called the day of worship of
Gaṇeśa. The Caturthī (4th day) of the bright lunar
fortnight in the month of Siṃha is the birth day of
Gaṇapati. It is a famous festival in North India. They
make the images of Gaṇapati, every year, and make
offerings to them on this particular day.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed, that he who sees the moon on Vināyaka
Caturthī, will be subjected to dishonour and derision.
This belief is based on the following story.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇapati is very fond of sweetmeat especially Kozhuk-
kaṭṭa (globular solid sweetmeat, called Modaka). It is
the custom in North India to worship Gaṇapati by
offering these sweetmeats, even today, with all kinds
of festivities. On one birthday Gaṇapati went from house
to house and ate belly-ful of modakas and returned
home on his conveyance, the rat. On the way the rat
saw a snake and began to tremble with fear. Due to
the shivering of its legs Gaṇapati fell down. The belly
of Gaṇapati was broken due to the fall and a large
quantity of modakas came out. Gaṇapati gathered
everything that fell out of his belly and stuffed them
again in the stomach and joining the cut edges entwin-
ed the snake tightly round the stomach. Candra who
was standing in the sky seeing all these things laughed
with contempt. At this, Gaṇapati got wild and plucked
his tusk and throwing it at the moon cursed him. “Let
[Page857-a+ 65]
nobody look at you on the Gaṇapati-festival day.”
(Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa). This story is slightly differ-
ent according to Gaṇeśa Purāṇa. That story is, that
Śrī Parameśvara gave a plum to his elder son
Subrahmaṇya without the knowledge of his younger son
Gaṇapati, on the 4th day of a bright lunar fortnight
and the moon who smiled at it, was cursed.
