JVĀLĀ II¦. The wife of Nīladhvaja. There is a story about
<div n="lb"/>this Jvālā in the “Jaimini Aśvamedha Parva”, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>15, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas began the sacrifice of Aśvamedha. Arjuna
<div n="lb"/>led the sacrificial horse. He continued his victorious
<div n="lb"/>march defeating all Kings and reached the city of Nīla-
<div n="lb"/>dhvaja. Nīladhvaja was not prepared for a fight. Seeing
<div n="lb"/>this his wife Jvālā tried various ways to push her
<div n="lb"/>husband to war. Seeing them to be futile she approa-
<div n="lb"/>ched her brother Unmūka and asked him to fight with
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna. He also was not prepared to fight with Arjuna.
<div n="lb"/>Jvālā became very angry and walked to the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges. When the Ganges-water touched her feet
<div n="lb"/>she stopped and said, “Dear me ! I am become sinful
[Page359-b+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>by the touch of Ganges-water.” The amazed Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>took the form of Sumaṅgalādevī and stood before Jvālā
<div n="lb"/>and aked her the reason for saying so. Jvālā said “Gaṅ-
<div n="lb"/>gādevī submerged her seven sons and killed them. After
<div n="lb"/>that she took the eighth son from Śantanu. That son
<div n="lb"/>too was killed by Arjuna in the Bhārata-battle. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā is childless and sinful.” Hearing this Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>Devī cursed Arjuna “Let his head be cut off in six
<div n="lb"/>months’ time.” Jvālā was satisfied. (For the result of
<div n="lb"/>the curse see under Arjuna, Para 28).
