SĀVITRĪ IV¦. The wife of Satyavān.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} In the country of Madra, famous in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas, there was a king named Aśvapati. His wife was
<div n="lb"/>Mālatī. Though the couple grew old they were child-
<div n="lb"/>less. At last they worshipped Devī Sāvitrī. After vows
<div n="lb"/>and prayers for eighteen years the Devī appeared before
<div n="lb"/>them, and giving them the boon that a daughter would
<div n="lb"/>be born to them, she disappeared. The couple returned
<div n="lb"/>to the palace and Mālatī conceived and delivered a
<div n="lb"/>daughter whom they named Sāvitrī. (Skandha 9, Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata; Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 293).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Sāvitrī grew up as though Lakṣmī had
<div n="lb"/>taken an incarnation and bloomed into a beautiful
<div n="lb"/>damsel. But nobody came forward to marry her. On
<div n="lb"/>a New moon day she bathed and purified herself and
<div n="lb"/>getting the blessings of Brahmins, came and bowed
<div n="lb"/>before her father. The King felt sorry as nobody had
<div n="lb"/>offered to marry her though she was in the full bloom of
<div n="lb"/>youth. He advised her to travel in the outside world
<div n="lb"/>and to select a husband by herself. According to the
<div n="lb"/>order of her father she took the aged ministers of the
<div n="lb"/>King and travelled through the forests in which hermits
<div n="lb"/>lived.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nārada came to the palace and while he was
<div n="lb"/>talking with King Aśvapati, Sāvitrī and the aged
<div n="lb"/>ministers returned. She bowed before her father and
<div n="lb"/>Nārada. As soon as Nārada saw her, he asked with
<div n="lb"/>curiosity about her marriage. The father replied that he
<div n="lb"/>had sent her in search of a husband. Sāvitrī said “I have
<div n="lb"/>accepted the Prince Satyavān as my husband. He is
<div n="lb"/>the son of King Dyumatsena of Sālva. Dyumatsena
<div n="lb"/>became blind in his old age, and taking this opportunity
<div n="lb"/>his enemies captured his country. Dyumatsena with
<div n="lb"/>his wife and son went to the forest and lived there.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada described the qualities of Satyavān. “Satyavān
<div n="lb"/>is as radiant as the sun, as intelligent as Bṛhaspati,
<div n="lb"/>as valiant as Indra and as patient as the Earth.
<div n="lb"/>Aśvapati was immensely pleased at hearing about the
<div n="lb"/>good qualities of Satyavān, and asked Nārada, if
<div n="lb"/>there was anything to say against him. Nārada said
<div n="lb"/>that he had nothing to say against Satyavān except
<div n="lb"/>that he would die “within one year from this date.”
<div n="lb"/>(Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 294).
<div n="NI"/>The King felt miserable when he heard this. Sāvitrī
<div n="lb"/>said that she had accepted Satyavān as her husband
<div n="lb"/>and that nothing could make her waver from her
<div n="lb"/>decision even if he is not going to live more than a
<div n="lb"/>year. The King agreed to the wish of his daughter and
<div n="lb"/>preparations for the marriage were begun. The King
<div n="lb"/>went with Sāvitrī to the forest and saw Dyumatsena
[Page713-b+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>who gladly consented to the marriage. Aśvapati return-
<div n="lb"/>ed to the palace leaving Sāvitrī with Satyavān and his
<div n="lb"/>parents. As soon as Aśvapati had returned, Sāvitrī dis-
<div n="lb"/>carded her ornaments and assumed the dress suitable
<div n="lb"/>to life in the forest and lived with them.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The death of Satyavān.%} It was nearly a year and the day
<div n="lb"/>of death of Satyavān was fast approaching. There were
<div n="lb"/>only four days more. Sāvitrī had taken a vow lasting
<div n="lb"/>for three days. Dyumatsena dissuaded her from taking
<div n="lb"/>fast. She completed the fast. There was left only one
<div n="lb"/>night more. She kept awake for the whole night.
<div n="lb"/>Morning came. Though she ended her fast she had not
<div n="lb"/>taken any food. Dyumatsena wanted to know the
<div n="lb"/>reason. She humbly said that she would eat only after
<div n="lb"/>sun-set.
<div n="NI"/>As usual Satyavān took his axe and started for the wood.
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī also followed him.
<div n="NI"/>Satyavān:-“You have never accompanied me before.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover you are very weak on account of the fast.
<div n="lb"/>Then how can you come with me?”
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī: “I am not at all weak by the fast and vow. I
<div n="lb"/>want to come with you. I pray, don't hinder me.”
<div n="NI"/>At last Satyavān consented after getting the permission of
<div n="lb"/>his parents. Both went to the forest to gather fruits and
<div n="lb"/>roots. They gathered fruits and roots. Then Satyavān began
<div n="lb"/>to cut wood. By that exertion Satyavān sweated all over.
<div n="lb"/>He was affected by headache. “Let me lie down!” He said.
<div n="lb"/>The axe fell from his hand. Sāvitrī caught her husband
<div n="lb"/>who was falling down and laid him on her lap. Sāvitrī
<div n="lb"/>saw a person clad in blood-coloured garments, with red
<div n="lb"/>eyes and a rope in hand, coming towards them. He
<div n="lb"/>came to the spot and stood there looking at the body of
<div n="lb"/>Satyavān. Realizing the person to be Kāla (Deathgod)
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī stood up instantly and bowed before him.
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī:—“Who are you Lord. What may be your
<div n="lb"/>object in coming here?”
<div n="NI"/>Yama:—Hei, Sāvitrī. As you are a hermitess of chas-
<div n="lb"/>tity I may converse with you. I am Yama. I am come to
<div n="lb"/>take away the life of your husband.”
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī:—“Lord, I have heard that your messengers
<div n="lb"/>come and take away the souls. How is it that you have
<div n="lb"/>come in person today?”
<div n="NI"/>Yama:—This Satyavān is a righteous man who is an
<div n="lb"/>ocean of good qualities. Messengers are not sent, in the
<div n="lb"/>cases of persons like him.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying thus Yama cast his rope and caught the soul of
<div n="lb"/>Satyavān. Sāvitrī saw the body of her husband lying
<div n="lb"/>without life and soul. Sāvitrī followed Yama who had
<div n="lb"/>gone to the south with the soul of Satyavān.
<div n="NI"/>Yama:—Child, you go back and conduct his funerals.
<div n="lb"/>You have followed your husband as far as you can.
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī:—I am coming to the place where my husband
<div n="lb"/>is being taken. That is the duty of a wife. What im-
<div n="lb"/>pediment is there on my way to follow you, when I
<div n="lb"/>have the merits of vow, fast, devotion to my elders, love
<div n="lb"/>and regard for my husband and the good will of your-
<div n="lb"/>self, my Lord.”
<div n="NI"/>When Yama realized that it was difficult to send
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī back, he asked Sāvitrī to ask for any boon. Yama
<div n="lb"/>was prepared to give anything except the life of Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vān. She requested for the recovery of sight by Dyumat-
<div n="lb"/>sena. Yama granted it. Still Sāvitrī did not turn back.
<div n="lb"/>Yama asked her to pray for one more boon. She
[Page714-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>requested for the recovery of the lost kingdom of Dyu-
<div n="lb"/>matsena. Yama sanctioned that request also. Still she
<div n="lb"/>followed Yama, who was ready to grant her a third
<div n="lb"/>boon. She requested: “My father may, please be given
<div n="lb"/>a hundred sons who would continue the family. Yama
<div n="lb"/>granted that too. But she did not turn back. Yama
<div n="lb"/>told her that she might ask for a fourth boon. She said:
<div n="lb"/>“I may be given a hundred sons born directly from
<div n="lb"/>Satyavān. Yama granted this fourth boon also. Then
<div n="lb"/>Sāvitrī asked Yama how the boon would be realized
<div n="lb"/>unless the life of Satyavān was given back to him.
<div n="lb"/>Yama was pleased with her at her love and devotion
<div n="lb"/>for her husband and returned the life of Satya-
<div n="lb"/>vān. Yama blessed her that she and Satyavān would
<div n="lb"/>live for hundred years.
<div n="NI"/>Yama disappeared. Sāvitrī returned and sat there
<div n="lb"/>taking the body of Satyavān on her lap. Satyavān
<div n="lb"/>came to life. Both of them rose up. Night came on. It
<div n="lb"/>was dark. They could not find the way. Satyavān
<div n="lb"/>wanted to reach their hermitage somehow. Sāvitrī
<div n="lb"/>took the axe and supporting her husband in the dim
<div n="lb"/>moon light, walked to the hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>Dyumatsena got sight. He started with his wife in
<div n="lb"/>search of his children, and walked about in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>At last all of them met together. They reached home.
<div n="lb"/>Then Sāvitrī told them all that had happened. Every-
<div n="lb"/>one was delighted. Then some people from Sālva came
<div n="lb"/>to the hermitage. They said that the minister had
<div n="lb"/>killed the King, that the people had expelled the
<div n="lb"/>minister, and that they had come to request Dyumat-
<div n="lb"/>sena to return to his country and to resume the reign.
<div n="lb"/>Accordingly all of them returned to Sālva. Dyumatsena
<div n="lb"/>was anointed as the King of Sālva. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 293 to 299).
