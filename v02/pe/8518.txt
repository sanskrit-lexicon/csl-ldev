<div n="lb"/>wife Kaikasī. In Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>274, there is a story about the birth of Vaiśravaṇa
<div n="lb"/>(Kubera) as son to Viśravas.
<div n="NI"/>The son Vaiśravaṇa was born to Pulastya. Vaiśravaṇa
<div n="lb"/>rejected his father Pulastya and served his grandfather
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. Pulastya did not like this. He generated an-
<div n="lb"/>other son Viśravas from half of his body. Viśravas
<div n="lb"/>tried to wreak vengeance on Vaiśravaṇa, who took
<div n="lb"/>refuge near Brahmā, who was much pleased at Vaiśra-
<div n="lb"/>vaṇa and granted him immortality, the state of being
<div n="lb"/>the owner of wealth, the position of ‘Lokapāla’, connec-
<div n="lb"/>tion with Śiva, a son named Nalakūbara, the city of
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā, the Puṣpaka Vimāna, the lordship of the
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas and the title Rājarāja (King of Kings).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family Life.%} Kubera engaged three beautiful Rākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>damsels, Puṣpotkaṭā, Rākā and Mālinī to attend on
<div n="lb"/>Viśravas. Puṣpotkaṭā had the name Kaikasī also.
<div n="lb"/>Kaikasī gave birth to Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa.
<div n="lb"/>Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā were born to Rākā and Mālinī
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to Vibhīṣaṇa. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>275, Verse 7).
