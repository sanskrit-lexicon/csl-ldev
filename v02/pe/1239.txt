BINDUGA¦. A Brāhmaṇa who lived in the village of
Bāṣkala. Being a frequenter of the houses of harlots
and of various other mean habits, he had led his wife
Cañcalā also to lead an immoral life. Once Binduga
called his wife and told her thus: “You may continue
the life of a harlot; but all the money acquired must be
handed over to me.” Thus they continued their lives
and after their death both were reborn as devils in the
mountain of Vindhya. In the midst of their life as devils,
once it chanced for Cañcalā to hear the Śiva Purāṇa
recited and she got her shape of devil changed. She
requested Pārvatī to change the shape of her husband
also. Pārvatī sent her attendant Tumburu to Binduga
to tell him the story of Śiva and thus he also got his form
changed. (Śiva Purāṇa Māhātmya).
