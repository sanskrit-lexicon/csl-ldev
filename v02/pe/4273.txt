MĀNASA IV¦. (MĀNASASARAS). A lake on the peak of
the Himālayas. Arjuna visited this lake once. (Śloka
4, Chapter 8, Sabhā Parva). In the precincts of this
lake many devotees conduct Śiva-worship. They believe
they would merge with Śiva at the end of the yuga.
Those who bathe in that pond would acquire mokṣa.
Mānasasaras is called Ujjānaka also. Vasiṣṭha and
Arundhatī became realised souls at this place. (Śloka
14, Chapter 130, Vana Parva). A sage who lived in
Mānasasaras in the form of a swan visited Bhīṣma
while he was lying on his bed of arrows. (Śloka 98,
Chapter 119, Bhīṣma Parva). Once a Devī named
Upaśruti pointed out Indra who was hiding amongst
the lotus stems in Mānasasaras. It was Brahmā who
made this lotus lake and the river Sarayū starts from
here. (Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
