ARUṆA VI¦. A Dānava (Asura) born in the dynasty of
<div n="lb"/>Vipracitti. He did tapas for long years repeating the
<div n="lb"/>Gāyatrī mantra, and got from Brahmā the boon not to
<div n="lb"/>die in war. Becoming very arrogant on account of this
<div n="lb"/>boon he left Pātāla (nether region) for the earth and
<div n="lb"/>deputed a messenger to challenge Indra for war. At that
<div n="lb"/>time a heavenly voice called out that as long as Aruṇa
<div n="lb"/>did not give up the Gāyatrī he could not be worsted in
<div n="lb"/>war. Then the Devas sent Bṛhaspati to Aruṇa to make
<div n="lb"/>him give up Gāyatrī. Aruṇa questioned Bṛhaspati as to
<div n="lb"/>why he of the enemy camp had come to him (Aruṇa).
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati replied: “You and I are not different; both
<div n="lb"/>of us are worshippers of Gāyatrī Devī. Being told so
<div n="lb"/>Aruṇa gave up worship of Gāyatrī Devī, and she felt
<div n="lb"/>offended at this and sent thousands of beetles against
<div n="lb"/>him. Thus, without fighting Aruṇa and his army were
<div n="lb"/>extinguished. (Devī Bhāgavata).
