CAÑCALĀKṢĪ II¦. A vidyādhara girl. Once while she
was concentrating her mind in prayer over Mahālaksmī,
Rāvaṇa, King of the Rākṣasas, committed rape on her,
and she cursed him that he should die on account of
Mahālakṣmī herself and accordingly at last he was
killed by Rāma on account of Sītā, the incarnation of
Mahālakṣmī. (Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa).
