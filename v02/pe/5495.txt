The other seventeen are: Bhṛgu, Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Viśva-
karmā, Maya, Nārada, Nagnajit, Viśālākṣa, Brahmā,
Kumāra, Nandīśa, Śaunaka, Garga, Vāśudeva, Śukra,

<div n="NI"/>According to Mahābhārata Lord Śiva wrote a book
“Vaiśālākṣa” containing ten thousand chapters dealing
with Dharmārthakāmas. Purandara condensed it into
a book of five thousand chapters called ‘Bāhudantaka.’
Purandara gave that book that name in honour of his
mother who was called Bāhudantī. (Chapters 59, 89
and 90, Śānti Parva).
