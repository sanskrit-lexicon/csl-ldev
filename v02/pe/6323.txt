SARPABALI¦. An offering made by Hindus in South
<div n="lb"/>India to propitiate serpents. Serpents are pleased by
<div n="lb"/>songs by Pulluvan and Pulluvatti (Male and female
<div n="lb"/>members of a Hindu sub-caste). To draw Kalams
<div n="lb"/>(drawings on floor conveying certain esoteric meanings),
<div n="lb"/>to make offerings and for the Pulluvars to sing—these
<div n="lb"/>form important elements of Sarpabali. The bali has
<div n="lb"/>a connection with the story of Khāṇḍavadāha. The
<div n="lb"/>legend behind the bali is that a Pulluva woman saved
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka, who escaped to the ocean after the Khāṇḍava
<div n="lb"/>forest was burnt down. Songs by Pulluvan and Pullu-
<div n="lb"/>vatti are unavoidable items in Sarpabali.
<div n="NI"/>Drawing the Kalam is a very important item in Sarpa-
<div n="lb"/>bali. It is drawn on a platform made of puṭṭumaṇṇu
<div n="lb"/>(small heaps of earth thrown up by earthworms and ter-
<div n="lb"/>mites), the platform being demarcated by four pieces
<div n="lb"/>of arecanut wood. The platform is covered with silk
<div n="lb"/>and tender coconut leaves are hung all around it. The
<div n="lb"/>Kalam is drawn with rice powder, and other coloured
<div n="lb"/>powders. The husk of paddy burnt into charcoal is
<div n="lb"/>powdered and with it serpents are sketched first on the
<div n="lb"/>maṇḍapa (platform). The nāga drawings are tinted
<div n="lb"/>with colours. The (colour) powders are collected in
<div n="lb"/>coconut shells and sprinkled on the drawings through
<div n="lb"/>holes in shells. Pulluvas exhibit wonderful artistic talents
<div n="lb"/>in making the drawings.
<div n="NI"/>When the kalam is drawn worship of nāga is begun
<div n="lb"/>compulsorily by a male member of the house, and he is
<div n="lb"/>technically called ‘Kalattil Kaimal’. He has been observ-
<div n="lb"/>ing ‘vrata’ during two days previous to the pūjā
<div n="lb"/>(worship). Having taken his bath and wearing an
<div n="lb"/>additional cloth across his shoulders (Uttarīya) he
<div n="lb"/>comes with water in a jar. Four lamps should be burn-
<div n="lb"/>ing on four sides of the kalam. Also, paddy, rice,
<div n="lb"/>tender coconut, milk, fruit etc. should be placed on its
<div n="lb"/>four sides. As directed by the Pulluvan the ‘Kaimal’
<div n="lb"/>conducts the worship by offering flower, water etc. The
<div n="lb"/>Kaimal is to sit on each of the four sides of the kalam
<div n="lb"/>and do the pūjā. Then wicks (made of cloth) should
<div n="lb"/>be lighted, water sprinkled on it and with that the
<div n="lb"/>Kaimal should go around the kalam thrice. With the
<div n="lb"/>wicks placed on a leaf with paddy underneath it and
<div n="lb"/>also with burning camphor he should go round the
[Page698-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>kalam. Then the Pulluvan playing on the Vīṇā in front
<div n="lb"/>and a male member of the house with a vessel contain-
<div n="lb"/>ing milk, a female member holding a lamp, two girls
<div n="lb"/>holding brass plates and the Kaimal and all of them
<div n="lb"/>following the Pulluvan go round the Kalam thrice and
<div n="lb"/>proceed to the serpents' temple in the compound, pray
<div n="lb"/>and return. After all these persons are seated, the
<div n="lb"/>Kaimal washes the feet of and puts flowers on the heads
<div n="lb"/>of the two girls, who had held the brass plates; seats
<div n="lb"/>them on two pieces of round wood in the kalam. The
<div n="lb"/>girls will have mirror etc. in their hands. They should
<div n="lb"/>concentrate their eyes on the heads of the serpents. Now
<div n="lb"/>begins the Pulluvan pāṭṭu (song by Pulluvan). At the
<div n="lb"/>time of the worship they will be beating tunes on a brass
<div n="lb"/>pot, music being made on the Vīṇā.
<div n="NI"/>‘Pulluvan pāṭṭu’ is the most important item in the whole
<div n="lb"/>programme. The songs relate to the burning of the
<div n="lb"/>khāṇḍava forest, Kāliyamardana (suppression of the
<div n="lb"/>nāga king) etc. One Pulluvan sings songs and a second
<div n="lb"/>one repeats them. A minimum of two Pulluva males
<div n="lb"/>and two females are required for the purpose. As the
<div n="lb"/>songs acquire momentum the girls begin to shake their
<div n="lb"/>heads and to wipe off the kalam. Then the girls are
<div n="lb"/>asked questions and they answer. Within a short time
<div n="lb"/>the girls will swoon and fall on the ground. They are
<div n="lb"/>brought back to consciousness by water being sprinkled
<div n="lb"/>on them and by fanning. This is in general the nature
<div n="lb"/>of a Sarpabali.
