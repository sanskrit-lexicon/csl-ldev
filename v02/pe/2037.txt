DHUNDHU I¦. A notorious Asura. He was the son of
<div n="lb"/>the Madhu Kaiṭabhas.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā was born in the lotus from the navel of Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>who was lying in meditation on the surface of water.
<div n="lb"/>From the ear-wax of Viṣṇu two asuras—Madhu and
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha sprang up. They terrified Brahmā by sha-
<div n="lb"/>king the stalk of the lotus. Brahmā became terribly
<div n="lb"/>afraid of the asuras and ran about on the surface of
<div n="lb"/>water. Hearing the cry of Brahmā Viṣṇu awoke, but
<div n="lb"/>he could not defeat the asuras. Viṣṇu decided to
<div n="lb"/>employ ‘Sāma’ (conciliation) the first expedient. The
<div n="lb"/>arrogant demons ordered Viṣṇu to ask of them any
<div n="lb"/>boon. Viṣṇu replied. “If it is so, you must be killed by
<div n="lb"/>me.” They could not but give the boon. They agreed
<div n="lb"/>to the request of Viṣṇu and said: “But we must be
<div n="lb"/>killed in an atmosphere, which is not cloudy.” Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>killed them when the atmosphere was clear.
<div n="NI"/>A son named Dhundhu had been born to Madhu and
<div n="lb"/>Kaiṭabha. Because Viṣṇu had killed his fathers
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu decided to take revenge on Viṣṇu and the
<div n="lb"/>Gods. With this idea in view Dhundhu began to do
<div n="lb"/>penance in the sandy desert of Ujjālaka in Marudhanva.
<div n="lb"/>Standing on one leg he did penance for thousands of
<div n="lb"/>years. Then Brahmā appeared before him and gave the
<div n="lb"/>boon that he would not be killed by Devas, Dānavas
<div n="lb"/>(asuras), Gandharvas (Demi-gods), Rākṣasas (demons),
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣas (paragods) and Uragas (serpents). Having got
<div n="lb"/>this boon, he lived under sand in the desert of Ujjālaka.
<div n="lb"/>His idea was to destroy the gods.
<div n="NI"/>A hermit named Uttaṅka had erected his hermitage in
<div n="lb"/>another part of Marudhanva and began penance. By his
<div n="lb"/>penance he made Viṣṇu appear before him and then
<div n="lb"/>made a request that Dhundhu's activities be put a
<div n="lb"/>stop to. Viṣṇu replied “Uttaṅka! Dhundhu has become
<div n="lb"/>a curse to the three worlds. There is a king named
<div n="lb"/>Kuvalāśva, born of the dynasty of Ikṣvāku. He will
<div n="lb"/>kill Dhundhu.” Saying these words, Viṣṇu disappear-
<div n="lb"/>ed.
<div n="NI"/>Uttaṅka went to the palace of Kuvalāśva and told
<div n="lb"/>him what Viṣṇu had said. Kuvalāśva and his sons
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest and killed Dhundhu in a fight.
<div n="lb"/>From that day Kuvalāśva came to be known by the
[Page240-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>name Dhundhumāra,
<F>1. Dhundhu was the son of Kaśyapa, born of Danu. It was to kill Dhundhu that Viṣṇu incarnated a Vāmana, Vāmanapurāna
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 8.</F> which meant ‘the killer of
<div n="lb"/>Dhundhu. (M.B. Vana Parva, 4 Chapters from 201).
