BHṚṄGĪ¦. A Maharṣi who was a devotee of Śiva. Once
<div n="lb"/>he went to Kailāsa and began to go round Śiva to pay
<div n="lb"/>homage to him. But since Pārvatī and Śiva were sitting
<div n="lb"/>together as one body, he could not go round Śiva sepa-
<div n="lb"/>rately. He did not have much reverence for Pārvatī.
<div n="lb"/>So he took the form of a female beetle (Bhṛṅgī) and
<div n="lb"/>bored his way through a hole made in the place where
<div n="lb"/>their bodies were united and thus went round Śiva alone.
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī was angry at this slight shown to her and cursed
<div n="lb"/>him to become physically weak. His legs became so
<div n="lb"/>weak that they were unable to support his body. So
<div n="lb"/>he prayed to Śiva again and he blessed him with a third
<div n="lb"/>leg. In this way Bhṛṅgī became a Maharṣi with three
<div n="lb"/>legs. (Maharṣis).
