AKṚTAVRAṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Akṛtavraṇa was a great sage of
erudition and was a disciple of Paraśurāma. He is ex-
tolled in the Purāṇas and it is said that Sūta who recited
first the story of Mahābhārata to an assembly of sages in
the forest of Naimiśa was a disciple of Akṛtavraṇa.
(Skandha 12 of Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he became a disciple of Paraśurāma.%} Para urāma
was returning after obtaining arrows from Lord Śiva
after pleasing him by fierce penance. He was walking
briskly through the dense forests anxious to be at the side
of his preceptors to get their blessings. As he passed a
great cave he heard a moan and on getting to the site
of the sound found a brahmin boy being attacked by a
tiger. The tiger immediately fell dead by an arrow from
[Page022-a+ 65]
Paraśurāma. Lo! the tiger turned into a gandharva
freed now from a curse because of which he was for years
living as a tiger. The gandharva bowed down respect-
fully and thanked the sage for giving him relief and left
the place. The brahmin boy fell down at the feet of
Paraśurāma and said, “Great Lord, because of you I
have now become Akṛtavraṇa meaning one who has not
received any wound. (Akṛta=not having secured.
Vraṇa=wound). I shall, therefore, be your disciple for-
ever hereafter”. From that day onwards he never left
Paraśurāma but followed him as his disciple.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} (1) In the story of Mahābhārata we
find Akṛtavraṇa in several different contexts appearing
on behalf of Paraśurāma. It was Akṛtavraṇa who told
Dharmaputra the life and exploits of Paraśurāma during
the exile of the Pāṇḍavas in the forests. (Chapters 115 to
117, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) In Chapter 83 of Udyoga Parva we read about
Akṛtavraṇa meeting Śrī Kṛṣṇa while the latter was going
to Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>(3) In Chapter 173 of Udyoga Parva we read about
Akṛtavraṇa detailing the history of the Kaurava dynasty
to Duryodhana.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Akṛtavraṇa has played a very important role in the
story of Ambā, daughter of the King of Kāśī. Ambā
along with her two sisters, Ambikā and Ambālikā, were
brought down to Hastināpura by Bhīṣma for his brother
Vicitravīrya to marry. But on knowing that Ambā had
mentally chosen Sālva as her husband, Bhīṣma allowed
her to go back to Sālva. But on her return to Sālva he
refused to accept her and she came back to Hastināpura.
Bhīṣma then requested Vicitravīrya to accept her as
his wife which, unfortunately, Vicitravīrya also refused
to do. Ambā then turned to Bhīṣma and besought him
to marry her which, much to his regret, he could not do
because of his vow of celibacy. Thus forsaken by all,
all her sweetness turned into bitter hatred towards
Bhīṣma and she remained alive thereafter only to kill
Bhīṣma. But even the foremost of warriors were not
willing to antagonise Bhīṣma and so her appeal to help
was not heeded by any. It was then that Hotravāha her
grandfather on the maternal side met her and directed
her to Paraśurāma. When she went to Paraśurāma it
was Akṛtavraṇa who received her and on hearing her
sorrowful tale encouraged her to seek vengeance on
Bhīṣma. Again it was he who persuaded Paraśurāma to
champion her cause and go for a fight against Bhīṣma.
During the fight Akṛtavraṇa acted as charioteer to
Paraśurāma. (Śloka 9, Chapter 179, Udyoga Parva,
M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Akṛtavraṇa was one of the many sages who were
lying on a bed of arrows during the great Kurukṣetra
battle. (Śloka 8, Chapter 26, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
