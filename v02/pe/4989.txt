PAÑCĀYATANA¦. An idol of Śiva in Kāśī. This idol is
called Oṃkāra also. Bhagavān Parameśvara who gives
mokṣa to men dwells in this idol in the form of Pañcā-
yatana. The five souls of Śiva are the five āyatanas.
They are Śānti (tranquillity), Atītaśānti (passed beyond
tranquillity), Parāparavidyā (Greater and smaller know-
ledge), Pratiṣṭhā (celebrity) and Nivṛtti (Recession).
Because these five āyatanas dwell in the idol of Śiva
at Kāśī it got the name Pañcāyatana. (Chapter 34,
Padma Purāṇa).
