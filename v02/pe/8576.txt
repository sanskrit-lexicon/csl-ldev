VIVAHA¦. An air (wind) which blows very speedily.
This wind will be transformed to a fierce storm which
will cause havoc everywhere. At the time of the great
flood this Vivaha will blow away the cloud called
Valāhaka in consequence of which destruction and
devastation will become rampant on earth. (M.B, Śānti
Parva, Chapter 328).
