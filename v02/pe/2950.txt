JAYADRATHA I¦. A mighty warrior King who ruled over
<div n="lb"/>the kingdom of Sindhu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order: Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas-
<div n="lb"/>Āyus—Nahuṣa—Yayāti—Pūru—Janamejaya—Prācin-
<div n="lb"/>vān—Pravīra—Namasyu—Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahuvi-
<div n="lb"/>dha—Saṃyāti—Rahovādi—Raudrāśva—Matināra—
<div n="lb"/>Santurodha—Duṣyanta—Bharata—Suhotra—Suhotā—
<div n="lb"/>Gala—Gardda—Suketu—Bṛhatkṣatra—Hasti—Ajamī-
<div n="lb"/>ḍha—Bṛhadiṣu—Bṛhaddhanu—Bṛhatkāya—Jayadratha
<F>1. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 67 that Jayadratha was the son of Bṛhatkṣatra. After Bharata, Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>kṣatra was the only famous and mighty emperor. Really speaking Jayadratha was the grandson of Bṛhatkṣatra. The statement that Jayad-
<div n="lb"/>ratha was the son of Bṛhatkṣatra only means that he was a descendant of that king.</F>
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and attainment of Boon.%} Jayadratha was born as
<div n="lb"/>a result of severe fasts and vows taken by his father.
<div n="lb"/>There was an ethereal voice at the birth of Jayadratha,
<div n="lb"/>“This child would become a very famous King.
<div n="lb"/>The head of him, who puts down the head of this child
<div n="lb"/>on the earth would break into a hundred pieces within a
<div n="lb"/>moment” His father was filled with joy when he heard
<div n="lb"/>this ethereal voice, and so he made Jayadratha King at
[Page353-b+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>a very young age and went to Samantapañcaka to per-
<div n="lb"/>form penance. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 146).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 116, Stanza 17, that Jayadratha married
<div n="lb"/>the princess Dusśalā.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Jayadratha and Pāñcālī.%} From the very beginning
<div n="lb"/>Jayadratha was a bitter enemy of the Pāṇḍavas. It is
<div n="lb"/>not difficult to find out the root of this enmity. It is
<div n="lb"/>stated in Ādi Parva, Chapter 185, Stanza 21 that Jayad-
<div n="lb"/>ratha was present at the svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī. The
<div n="lb"/>fact that he did not get Pāñcālī, might have laid the
<div n="lb"/>foundation of this enmity.
<div n="NI"/>From this moment Jayadratha was looking forward to a
<div n="lb"/>chance to carry off Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>The forest life of the Pāṇḍavas began. They wandered
<div n="lb"/>through many forests and finally reached the forest,
<div n="lb"/>Kāmyaka. Once the Pāṇḍavas left Pāñcālī alone in the
<div n="lb"/>hut and went to the forest for hunting. Jayadratha
<div n="lb"/>came to know of this. He came with his men to the
<div n="lb"/>place where the hut stood. At the very first sight of
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī, he fell in love with her. He sent Koṭikāsya,
<div n="lb"/>the King of Trigarta, who was the son of Suratha as a
<div n="lb"/>messenger to Pāñcālī. Koṭikāsya told Pāñcālī about the
<div n="lb"/>superior qualities of Jayadratha and requested her to
<div n="lb"/>accept Jayadratha, leaving the Pāṇḍavas. But she
<div n="lb"/>rejected his request. The messenger returned to Jayad-
<div n="lb"/>ratha and told him what had happened. Jayadratha
<div n="lb"/>himself came in a chariot and tried to entice her.
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī did not yield. Jayadratha caught her by force
<div n="lb"/>and took her away in his chariot. Dhaumya the priest
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāṇḍavas followed them with tears. Shortly after-
<div n="lb"/>wards, the Pāṇḍavas returned to the hut. They searched
<div n="lb"/>for Pāñcālī here and there. They heard everything
<div n="lb"/>from a maid, and instantly followed Jayadratha, whose
<div n="lb"/>army confronted the Pāṇḍavas. The heads of almost all
<div n="lb"/>the warriors of Jayadratha fell on the ground. Jayad-
<div n="lb"/>ratha fled from the battlefield. The Pāṇḍavas followed
<div n="lb"/>him and caught him and scourged him. Bhīma shaved
<div n="lb"/>his head letting only five hairs to stand on the head.
<div n="lb"/>They took him as a prisoner before Dharmaputra.
<div n="lb"/>Finally at the instruction of Yudhiṣṭhira and Pāñcālī,
<div n="lb"/>he was released. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 264 to
<div n="lb"/>272).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) In the sacrifice of Rājasūya (imperial consecration)
<div n="lb"/>performed by Yudhiṣṭhira, Jayadratha took part as a
<div n="lb"/>tributary King. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 34,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Jayadratha was present at the game of dice between
<div n="lb"/>Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>58, Stanza 28).
<div n="NI"/>(3) It was while going to Sālva to marry a damsel that
<div n="lb"/>Jayadratha attacked Pāñcālī at the forest of Kāmyaka.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 264).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Feeling ashamed at the result of his attempt to
<div n="lb"/>carry off Pāñcālī, Jayadratha went direct to Gaṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>dvāra and pleased Śiva by penance. Śiva gave him the
<div n="lb"/>boon that he would be able to defeat all the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>except Arjuna. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 272).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Jayadratha in the battle of Bhārata.%}
<div n="lb"/>In the battle of Bhārata, which lasted for eighteen days
<div n="lb"/>between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, Jayadratha
[Page354-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>took the side of the Kauravas and fought against the
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍavas. The part played by him in the battle is given
<div n="lb"/>below:—
<div n="NI"/>On the first day there was a combat between Jayad-
<div n="lb"/>ratha and Drupada. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>45, Stanzas 55 to 57).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Attacked Bhīmasena. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 79, Stanzas 17 to 20).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Fought with Arjuna and Bhīmasena. (M.B. Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapters 113 and 115).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Engaged in a combat with the King Virāṭa. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 116, Stanzas 42 to 44).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Jayadratha and Abhimanyu fought with each
<div n="lb"/>other. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 14, Stanzas 64
<div n="lb"/>to 74).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Fought with Kṣatravarman. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 25, Stanzas 10 to 12).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jayadratha, who
<div n="lb"/>tried to flee from the battle-field when he came to know
<div n="lb"/>of this. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 74, Stanzas 4
<div n="lb"/>to 12).
<div n="NI"/>(8) He began to combat with Arjuna. (M.B. Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter, 145).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The death of Jayadratha.%} When a fierce fight began
<div n="lb"/>between Arjuna and Jayadratha, Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna and said, “Arjuna, there was an ethereal voice
<div n="lb"/>at the birth of Jayadratha. The head of the person who
<div n="lb"/>puts down the head of Jayadratha on the earth, would
<div n="lb"/>be broken into a hundred pieces. So send an arrow in
<div n="lb"/>such a way that his head falls on the lap of his father.”
<div n="lb"/>Hearing this, Arjuna sent an arrow which cut off the
<div n="lb"/>head of Jayadratha and the head fell in the lap of Jayad-
<div n="lb"/>ratha's father who had been sitting in deep penance
<div n="lb"/>and meditation in Samantapañcaka. Instantly the father
<div n="lb"/>awoke from meditation and stood up and the head of
<div n="lb"/>his beloved son, with ear-rings on both ears fell on the
<div n="lb"/>earth and the head of the father was broken into a
<div n="lb"/>hundred pieces and he died. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>146, Stanzas 104 to 130).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The names of Jayadratha.%} Saindhavaka, Saindhava,

<div n="lb"/>Sindhurāṭ, Sindhusauvīrabhartā, Suvīra, Suvīrarāṣṭrapa,
