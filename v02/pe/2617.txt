HARIVAṂŚA¦(M). An appendix to the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>in 10,000 verses. The main object of it is to sing the
<div n="lb"/>praises of Mahāviṣṇu. It contains three parts called
<div n="lb"/>respectively Harivaṃśa Parva, Viṣṇu Parva, and Bha-
<div n="lb"/>viṣya Parva. Creation of the world, kings of the solar
<div n="lb"/>dynasty and of the lunar dynasty, Yadu dynasty and the
<div n="lb"/>birth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa form the theme of Harivaṃśa Parva.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Parva deals mainly with the pranks and games
<div n="lb"/>of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in his childhood. Though there occur
<div n="lb"/>certain hints about the future at the beginning of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhaviṣya Parva, the creation of the world, the incar-
<div n="lb"/>nation of Viṣṇu as Vāmana (Dwarf) and as Narasiṃha
<div n="lb"/>(half man and half lion), Śiva and Viṣṇu constitute its
<div n="lb"/>main theme.
<div n="NI"/>The following verses prove that the Harivaṃśa also was
<div n="lb"/>composed by Vyāsa.
<Poem>Harivaṃśastataḥ parva-
<div n="lb"/>purāṇaṃ khilasaṃjñitam /
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇuparvaśi śoścaryā
<div n="lb"/>Visṇoḥkaṃsavadhastathā //
<div n="lb"/>Bhaviṣyam parvacāpyuktaṃ

<div n="lb"/>Etat parvaśatam pūrṇam
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsenoktaṃ mahātmanā //</Poem>
