KĪCAKA¦. Brother-in-law of Mātsya, king of Virāṭa and
son of Kekaya, king of the Sūtas.
[Page411-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} To Kekaya, king of the Sūtas
was born of queen Mālavī, Kīcaka and other 105 sons
younger to him called Upa-Kīcakas. Their only sister
was called Sudeṣṇā, (Bhārata, Southern text, Page
1898). Kīcaka and Upa-Kīcakas took their birth from
an aspect of Bāṇa, the eldest of the Asuras known as
the Kālakeyas. (See Bhārata, Page 1893). Mātsya, the
Virāṭa king wedded Sudeṣṇā; and from that day on-
wards, the brothers too lived in the Virāṭa palace. Kīcaka
was the chieftain of Virāṭa's army, and he had, many a
time, defeated in war King Suśarman of Trigarta.
(Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 30).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kīcaka and Pāñcālī.%} During their life incognito,
the Pāṇḍavas lived in the Virāṭa palace after taking
up various jobs. Pāñcāli, under the assumed name
Mālinī, served Sudeṣṇā and her daughter Uttarā as
their chaperon. Kīcaka fell in love with Pāñcālī at
first sight. But, Pāñcālī resisted all his advances. Then,
he sought the help of his sister Sudeṣṇā to bring round
Pāñcālī to him somehow. Sudeṣṇā asked Kīcaka to be
ready on the New Moon day with liquor and rice and
promised to send Mālinī (Pāñcālī) to him. Ordered
by Sudeṣṇā, she went to Kīcaka with his plate of food
much against her will. Kīcaka caught hold of her, but
she ran when the former caught her by the hair, felled
her on the floor and kicked her. A Rākṣasa, who was
deputed for Pāñcālī's security appeared on the scene in
a trice and felled Kīcaka.
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kīcaka's Death.%} The very same night with tears in
her eyes, Pāñcālī told Bhīma all about the indecent
behaviour. He asked Pāñcālī to invite Kīcaka to a
secret meeting at a specified place the next night, and
promised her that he would remain concealed there
and kill Kīcaka. Accordingly Bhīma concealed himself
the next night in the dancing hall and, as requested by
Pāñcālī, Kīcaka came to the hall at midnight to spend
a few hours with Pāñcālī. Bhīma was lying there on
a cot, and Kīcaka, mistaking him for Pāñcālī kissed
him. Bhīma caught him in his iron grips and crushed him
to death. The next morning, it was the fate of Kīcaka's
brothers to lament over his death. The story also was
spread that Kīcaka was killed by some Gandharva, the
husband of Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>The Upa-Kīcakas removed the dead body of their
brother to the burning ghat. Proclaiming that Pāñcālī,
who was responsible for the death of their brother
would also be burnt to death on the same pyre, the
Upa-Kīcakas forcibly took her with them. Hearing the
heart-rending cries of Pāñcālī Bhīma rushed to the spot
and killed all the Upa-Kīcakas and saved Pāñcālī
from death. In the presence of the Virāṭa king the
cremation of Kīcaka and the Upa-Kīcakas took place.
(Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 13 et seq).
