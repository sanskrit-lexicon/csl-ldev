NAMUCI II¦. An army-captain of Hiraṇyākṣa. In the
battle with Indra, Namuci made him unconscious and
the elephant Airāvata thrust its tusks on the ground.
After that by his magic and sorcery he created many
creatures. But Viṣṇu destroyed all those creatures with
his discus Sudarśana. At last Indra killed Namuci.
