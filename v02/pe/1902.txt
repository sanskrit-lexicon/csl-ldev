DHANAVARDHANA¦. A virtuous Vaiśya who lived in
the island of Puṣkara in the Kṛtayuga. Once Dhana-
vardhana after having performed Vaiśvadeva sat for
his food. At that time he heard a cry from outside
“Annaṃ dehi (give me food)”. Dhanavardhana imme-
diately came out to see who the visitor was but seeing
none went in and started taking his food. Because he
ate his food once left aside, his body was torn to
hundred pieces. (Bhaviṣya, Brahma Kāṇḍa).
