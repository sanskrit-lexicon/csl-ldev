ĀṄGIRASĪ¦. A very chaste wife of a Brahmin. By the
curse of Śakti, son of Vasiṣṭha Kalmāṣapāda, a king of
the Ikṣvāku dynasty became a demon. That demon
killed and devoured the husband of Āṅgirasī. Enraged
at this the Brahmin lady cursed Kalmāṣapāda saying
that if he touched his wife thereafter he would die.
That was why Vasiṣṭha had to beget a son for Kal-
māṣapāda of his wife. (Ślokas 16-22, Chapter 181, Ādi
Parva, M.B.).
