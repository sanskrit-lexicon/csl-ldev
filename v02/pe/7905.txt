VAIŚVADEVA¦(M). A sacrifice. It is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, that a brahmin should
<div n="lb"/>perform this sacrifice to protect himself from hurts
<div n="lb"/>caused by oven, threshing stone, axe, cutting knife, and
<div n="lb"/>other weapons. This sacrifice could be performed in a
<div n="lb"/>cavity for kindling fire on the floor besmeared with
<div n="lb"/>cowdung and mud. It should not be done in an
<div n="lb"/>ordinary oven meant for cooking, in iron oven, in
<div n="lb"/>earthenware or on ordinary floor. As all the deities
<div n="lb"/>are having faces of fire, the sacrificial fire should not be
<div n="lb"/>kindled by fanning the flame with hand, winnow, hide
<div n="lb"/>of black antelope or cloth. By fanning the flame with
<div n="lb"/>cloth, the sacrificer will contract disease; by winnowing
<div n="lb"/>he would sustain loss of wealth; and death, by fanning
<div n="lb"/>with hand. Plums, fruits, roots, curd, ghee etc. could
<div n="lb"/>be used as burnt offerings. When these are not avail-
<div n="lb"/>able, firewood, roots of herbs, grass etc. could be used
<div n="lb"/>instead. Things to be offered as burnt-offerings should
<div n="lb"/>be purified, first by sprinkling ghee on them. In the
<div n="lb"/>absence of ghee, milk, curd and water may be used.
<div n="lb"/>Using things which are unfit as burnt-offerings will
<div n="lb"/>invite bad results.
<div n="NI"/>In Vaiśvadeva-sacrifice, half-burnt firewood used in
<div n="lb"/>cooking, should never be used. So also salts of any
<div n="lb"/>kind. After finishing Vaiśvadeva, Gogrāsa (giving rice
<div n="lb"/>to cow) also should be done.
