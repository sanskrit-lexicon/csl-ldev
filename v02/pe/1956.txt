DHARMAŚARMĀ I¦. A brahmin who was born a parrot
<div n="lb"/>named Kañjala in his rebirth. Dharmaśarmā was one of
[Page231-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>the three sons of an eminent Brahmin called Vidyādhara.
<div n="lb"/>His other two sons were Vasuśarmā and Nāmaśarmā.
<div n="lb"/>While both his brothers became great scholars Dhar-
<div n="lb"/>maśarmā never studied anything and became a muff.
<div n="lb"/>His father was greatly worried on account of this.
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaśarmā never heeded the advice of his father
<div n="lb"/>and went about in bad company ruining himself. Years
<div n="lb"/>went by and Dharmaśarmā became old.
<div n="NI"/>One day Dharmaśarmā was sitting repentant in a
<div n="lb"/>temple sadly pondering over his past when a siddha
<div n="lb"/>came to the temple. Watching him Dharmaśarmā saw
<div n="lb"/>him go and sit in a lonely place for meditation with his
<div n="lb"/>eyes shut. Dharmaśarmā went and stood near him
<div n="lb"/>very respectfully. When the Siddha opened his eyes
<div n="lb"/>after some time he saw Dharmaśarmā standing before
<div n="lb"/>him and then the Siddha made enquiries about Dhar-
<div n="lb"/>maśarmā. The latter then requested the Siddha to give
<div n="lb"/>him instructions to acquire the supreme knowledge.
<div n="lb"/>The Siddha then gave him Jñānopadeśa (advice on
<div n="lb"/>knowledge) and Dharmaśarmā soon became a Siddha
<div n="lb"/>himself. He then started on a pilgrimage and on the
<div n="lb"/>way he got a parrot. He took care of the bird just like
<div n="lb"/>his son and loved it very affectionately. One day when
<div n="lb"/>Dharmaśarmā was away from the place to collect
<div n="lb"/>fruits for his food a cat caught and ate the parrot.
<div n="lb"/>Greatly grief-stricken Dharmaśarmā wept bitterly and
<div n="lb"/>ran about like a mad man. After some days he died
<div n="lb"/>and because at the time of death he was thinking about
<div n="lb"/>the parrot he was born a parrot in his next birth. The
<div n="lb"/>jñānopadeśa of the siddha was still lingering in him
<div n="lb"/>while he died and so even in his life as a parrot the never
<div n="lb"/>lost the jñāna he had acquired in his previous life.
<div n="lb"/>(Chapter 122, Padma Purāṇa).
