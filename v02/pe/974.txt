BHADRAKA II¦. A brahmin outcaste. This brahmin, who
spent his whole life in committing sins, by chance,
took māgha bath for three days at Prayāga, and thus
got himself sanctified.
<div n="NI"/>King Vīrasena, who was then ruling the Avanti king-
dom had earned ample sanctity by the performance of
seventeen Aśvamedha yāgas. The Deaths of King
Vīrasena and Bhadraka took place on one and the same
day. Though Bhadraka was immoral in his life, he
went to heaven along with Vīrasena after death as he
had taken the māgha bath. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara-
khaṇḍa).
