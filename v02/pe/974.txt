BHADRAKA II¦. A brahmin outcaste. This brahmin, who
<div n="lb"/>spent his whole life in committing sins, by chance,
<div n="lb"/>took māgha bath for three days at Prayāga, and thus
<div n="lb"/>got himself sanctified.
<div n="NI"/>King Vīrasena, who was then ruling the Avanti king-
<div n="lb"/>dom had earned ample sanctity by the performance of
<div n="lb"/>seventeen Aśvamedha yāgas. The Deaths of King
<div n="lb"/>Vīrasena and Bhadraka took place on one and the same
<div n="lb"/>day. Though Bhadraka was immoral in his life, he
<div n="lb"/>went to heaven along with Vīrasena after death as he
<div n="lb"/>had taken the māgha bath. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara-
<div n="lb"/>khaṇḍa).
