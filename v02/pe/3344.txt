KARKOṬAKA¦. A terrible serpent.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This serpent was born to Kaśyapa by his
<div n="lb"/>wife Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The curse.%} Once Karkoṭaka cheated the sage Nārada.
<div n="lb"/>The angry sage cursed him and said that he would
<div n="lb"/>have to remain without the power of movements in
<div n="lb"/>the forest till Nala came to rescue him. From that day
<div n="lb"/>Karkoṭaka lived in that forest, awaiting the arrival of
<div n="lb"/>Nala.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Nala and Karkoṭaka.%} Once a wild fire spread all
<div n="lb"/>over the forest. Karkoṭaka whose power of movement
<div n="lb"/>was destroyed by Nārada's curse, cried aloud, calling
<div n="lb"/>upon Nala to come and save him. It was at this time
<div n="lb"/>that Nala arrived at the spot after leaving Damayantī
<div n="lb"/>in the forest. Nala came to him, on hearing his cries.
<div n="lb"/>The serpent informed Nala about the story of Nārada's
<div n="lb"/>curse and reducing himself to the size of a thumb sat
<div n="lb"/>on the ground. Nala removed him to a safe spot away
[Page391-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>from the fire. The serpent asked Nala to walk a few
<div n="lb"/>steps counting his footsteps. Nala did so and at the
<div n="lb"/>tenth step, Karkoṭaka stung him and his whole body
<div n="lb"/>was turned blue. Suddenly Karkoṭaka assumed his own
<div n="lb"/>original shape and spoke to Nala as follows:—“I have
<div n="lb"/>changed your appearance so that people may not be
<div n="lb"/>able to recognize you. Kali who is troubling you, still
<div n="lb"/>lives within you. It is he who is affected by my
<div n="lb"/>poison. You need not fear danger from poison any
<div n="lb"/>more. You will never be defeated in battle. Go and
<div n="lb"/>engage yourself as the charioteer of Ṛtuparṇa, King of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā. You will teach him Aśvahṛdaya mantra. In
<div n="lb"/>return for it he will teach you Akṣahṛdaya mantra.
<div n="lb"/>Here are two garments which I give you. If you put
<div n="lb"/>them on, you will be restored to your own shape.
<div n="lb"/>May you be blessed again with a happy family life.”
<div n="lb"/>After saying this, Karkoṭaka vanished. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 66).
