UNMADĀ¦. A celestial woman.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Became a woman by the curse of Uravaśī.%} Haṃsa, the
<div n="lb"/>King of Gandharvas (semi-gods) had a general of the
<div n="lb"/>army called Durmada. He was a dangler. He had an
<div n="lb"/>eye on Urvaśī. She was the wife of Purūravas a famous
<div n="lb"/>King. On several occasions Durmada followed Urvaśī,
<div n="lb"/>with lustful desire. He had expressed his amour for her
<div n="lb"/>on several occasions. But Urvaśī did not pay any heed
<div n="lb"/>to his words.
<div n="NI"/>One day Purūravas and Urvaśī were present in the
<div n="lb"/>durbar of Indra. Purūravas and Urvaśī had signalled
<div n="lb"/>a rendezvous for that night at the corner of the Nan-
<div n="lb"/>dana Park. Durmada understood this. He called a
<div n="lb"/>celestial woman named Unmadā to his side. They made
<div n="lb"/>a plan and accordingly Unmadā disguised herself as
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī and Durmada took the guise of Purūravas and
<div n="lb"/>both of them entered Nandana park. Purūravas went to
<div n="lb"/>Unmadā and conjugated with her. In the same way
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī received Durmada, mistaking him for Purūravas.
<div n="lb"/>After the conjugation Durmada laughed loud as if he
<div n="lb"/>had played a trick on Urvaśī. Urvaśī understood every-
<div n="lb"/>thing. Purūravas also arrived there. Urvaśī cursed
<div n="lb"/>Durmada to take birth in the earth as a Rākṣasa and
<div n="lb"/>cursed Unmadā to be born in the earth as the daughter
<div n="lb"/>of a King and she said that at that time she would love
<div n="lb"/>one man and become the wife of another man. The
<div n="lb"/>aggrieved Durmada and Unmadā prayed for liberation
<div n="lb"/>from the curse. Urvaśī gave them liberation thus:—
<div n="lb"/>“This Durmada will be born as the son of Unmadā.
<div n="lb"/>Seeing the death of her husband and son, she would
<div n="lb"/>jump into fire. After that she will enter heaven.
<div n="lb"/>Durmada will be killed by the sword of an enemy and
<div n="lb"/>will obtain heaven.” According to this curse Durmada
<div n="lb"/>was born as the son of Dīrghajaṅgha, the emperor of
<div n="lb"/>Hiraṇyapura, under the name Pingākṣa and Unmadā
[Page807-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>was born as the daughter of the King of Videha. Her
<div n="lb"/>name was Hariṇī (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The marriage and death of Hariṇī.%} Hariṇī grew up to
<div n="lb"/>be a young woman Once Piṅgākṣa growing lustful took
<div n="lb"/>Hariṇī and went through the sky. She cried aloud for
<div n="lb"/>a long time. Piṅgākṣa, the asura, left her in a wild
<div n="lb"/>forest. At that time a King named Vasumanas came
<div n="lb"/>by that way hunting. He killed Piṅgākṣa and then
<div n="lb"/>having heard the story of Hariṇī got her on the horse
<div n="lb"/>called Jīmūta and sent her to Videha (Mithilā). Her
<div n="lb"/>father was much pleased at getting her back. He want-
<div n="lb"/>ed to give her in marriage to Vasumanas. The date of
<div n="lb"/>the marriage was fixed. Invitations were sent to many
<div n="lb"/>Kings. Among them there was a king named Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>śreṇya, who took her by force and went away. There
<div n="lb"/>was a fierce battle between the two Kings, Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>śreṇya and Vasumanas and Vasumanas was defeated. See-
<div n="lb"/>ing this Divodāsa, the King of Kāśī, attacked Bhadraśre-
<div n="lb"/>ṇya. Though Divodāsa defeated Bhadraśreṇya, he did
<div n="lb"/>not like to harm the beaten King. So he returned to his
<div n="lb"/>kingdom. Bhadraśreṇya took Hariṇī to his palace and
<div n="lb"/>married her. A son was born to her and he was named
<div n="lb"/>Durmada. This was the same Durmada who had
<div n="lb"/>taken birth and died as Piṅgākṣa and who had been born
<div n="lb"/>again as the son of Hariṇī. This Durmada took by force
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of his uncle called Citrāṅgī and a child
<div n="lb"/>was born to them. Bhadraśreṇya again engaged in a
<div n="lb"/>battle with Divodāsa, the King of Kāśī, and was defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed. Then his son Durmada got into the battlefield and
<div n="lb"/>he also was defeated.
<div n="NI"/>When all this news reached Vasumanas, the King
<div n="lb"/>of Ayodhyā, he became jealous of Bhadraśreṇya. A
<div n="lb"/>battle was fought between them in which Vasumanas
<div n="lb"/>was defeated. But a fierce battle was fought again in
<div n="lb"/>which Bhadraśreṇya and his son Durmada were killed.
<div n="lb"/>Durmada obtained heaven. Stricken with grief at the
<div n="lb"/>death of her husband and son, Hariṇī got into fire and
<div n="lb"/>went to heaven. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 3).
