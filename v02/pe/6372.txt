ŚATADRŪ¦. The Purāṇic name of the Indian river now
<div n="lb"/>called Sutlej. Grief-stricken over the death of his son,
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha once jumped into this river, which, realising
<div n="lb"/>that the maharṣi was as powerful as fire, divided itself
<div n="lb"/>into many branches and flowed in various directions,
<div n="lb"/>and hence the river came to be known as Śatadrū.
<div n="lb"/>(Ādi Parva, Chapter 176, Verse 8). Once in talking
<div n="lb"/>about sublime rivers to Śiva, Pārvatī mentioned this
<div n="lb"/>river also. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 146, Verse 18).
<div n="lb"/>Śatadrū is also one of the ten rivers referred to in the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda.
