VYĀSA¦. The sage Vyāsa who is the author of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order: Brahmā-Vasiṣṭha-Śakti-Parāśara-Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Vyāsa was born to hermit Parāśara by a fisher-
<div n="lb"/>woman named Kālī. His name when he was a child
<div n="lb"/>was Kṛṣṇa. As his birth took place in an island (Dvīpa)
<div n="lb"/>he got the name Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana. After dividing the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas he got the name Vedavyāsa. He is the composer
<div n="lb"/>of Mahābhārata, one of the greatest books in world-
<div n="lb"/>literature. The births of great men, generally will be
<div n="lb"/>wonderful. Behind the birth of Vyāsa also there is a
<div n="lb"/>wonderful story.
<div n="NI"/>As has already been mentioned, Kālī, a fisherwoman
<div n="lb"/>was the mother of Vyāsa. There is a story about this
<div n="lb"/>Kālī also. When king Vasu of Cedi went to the forest
<div n="lb"/>for hunting, he saw the coition of animals and he had
<div n="lb"/>seminal discharge. The king sent that semen to his
<div n="lb"/>queen. But on the way it fell in the river Kālindī and
<div n="lb"/>was eaten by a fish. This fish was a celestial maid
<div n="lb"/>named Adrikā transformed to fish by a curse. The fish
<div n="lb"/>conceived and got into the net of a fisherman, who lived
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of Kālindī. When this fish was cut open
<div n="lb"/>a male and a female infant were seen inside. The male
<div n="lb"/>child was given to the king himself. The fisherman
<div n="lb"/>brought up the girl naming her Kālī. As the girl had
<div n="lb"/>the gandha (smell) of matsya (fish), she got the name
<div n="lb"/>‘Matsya-gandhā’, also. This fisherman was also a ferry-
<div n="lb"/>man. Kālī used to help her father in ferrying people
<div n="lb"/>across the river Kālindī. She grew up and became a
<div n="lb"/>young woman.
<div n="NI"/>Once the hermit Parasara came by that way to go to
<div n="lb"/>the other side of the river. At that time, the fisherman
<div n="lb"/>who has been taking people across the river, was sitting
<div n="lb"/>on the bank of the river and having his meals. As soon
<div n="lb"/>as Parāśara came, the innocent fisherman—the foster-
<div n="lb"/>father of Matsyagandhā—called her, who was standing
<div n="lb"/>close by and asked her to take the hermit across the
[Page885-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>river. The hermit got into the boat. Matsyagandhā
<div n="lb"/>began to row the boat. The beauty of the damsel sitting
<div n="lb"/>in front of him and the little waves of the river, com-
<div n="lb"/>bined together had the effect of arousing passion in the
<div n="lb"/>hermit. He became sexually excited and sat close to her.
<div n="lb"/>Discerning his intention she moved away from him and
<div n="lb"/>prayed to him humbly not to violate her chastity. She
<div n="lb"/>repeated her prayer. The hermit Parāśara created an
<div n="lb"/>artificial fog around the boat. The smell of fish was
<div n="lb"/>gone from her and the fragrance of Musk took its place.
<div n="lb"/>The hermit created an artificial island in the middle of
<div n="lb"/>the river. They got down on the island and acted a love
<div n="lb"/>drama. She became pregnant. Parāśara said to her.
<div n="lb"/>“Beautiful girl! Even after your confinement you shall
<div n="lb"/>remain a virgin. A son, who will be a portion of Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>a man of purity, famous throughout the three worlds,
<div n="lb"/>highly learned, the teacher-priest of the whole world,
<div n="lb"/>shall be born to you. He will divide the Vedas and will
<div n="lb"/>be exalted by the people of the world.”
<div n="NI"/>After this the great hermit took his bath in Yamunā and
<div n="lb"/>went away. The pregnancy of Kālī was completed in-
<div n="lb"/>stantly and she gave birth to a very handsome boy in
<div n="lb"/>that island of Yamunā. As soon as he was born, he grew
<div n="lb"/>up and became a hermit radiant with devotion and as-
<div n="lb"/>suming a vow of purity and abstinence he said to his
<div n="lb"/>mother. “Mother! You can go anywhere, as you please.
<div n="lb"/>You need have no worry on my account. I am about to
<div n="lb"/>go for penance. When anything unpleasant happens to
<div n="lb"/>you, just think of me. The moment you wish to see me,
<div n="lb"/>I will be there by you. I wish you a happy life. I am
<div n="lb"/>going.” Saying thus the brave boy walked away. (Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata, Skandha 2; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 60 to 63).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Spiritual life.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%i) Introduction.%} Two sides, the spiritual as well as the
<div n="lb"/>material, are seen in the life of Vyāsa. It was after the
<div n="lb"/>marriage of Śantanu, a king of the Lunar dynasty, with
<div n="lb"/>his mother Kālī, otherwise known as Satyavatī, that
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa came into contact with Hastināpura. Participating
<div n="lb"/>in all the vicissitudes of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>was the worldly side of the life of Vyāsa. But the major
<div n="lb"/>part of his life was spent in living as a hermit in his
<div n="lb"/>hermitage in the forest with a large group of disciples;
<div n="lb"/>teaching them the Vedas. A small description of that
<div n="lb"/>spiritual life is given below:
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%In the forest.%} We do not see Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana, who
<div n="lb"/>had grown up to a youth at the time of his birth, for
<div n="lb"/>many years after his departure, bidding adieu to his
<div n="lb"/>mother. He might have been living with hermits in the
<div n="lb"/>forests, learning Vedas from them. After this he appears
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of river Sarasvatī as a teacher and Priest.
<div n="lb"/>As he was doing penance there, he saw two sparrows,
<div n="lb"/>legs and beaks red, without even down feathers, crying
<div n="lb"/>for food, and the parent birds, with the utmost care and
<div n="lb"/>tenderness feeding them. They flew about here and there
<div n="lb"/>and gathered food and came back quickly. Because of
<div n="lb"/>joy at the sight of their parents, the little ones opened
<div n="lb"/>their ruby-red mouths with cries and throbbing. They
<div n="lb"/>kissed the young ones and fed them. The young spar-
<div n="lb"/>rows hid under the wings of their father and mother
<div n="lb"/>and enjoyed the surroundings by thrusting out their
<div n="lb"/>heads and looking on all sides.
<div n="NI"/>{%iii) Birth of son.%} Seeing this, the paternity instinct in
<div n="lb"/>him was aroused. He understood that love of children
<div n="lb"/>was merely for the sake of love, that this love was pure
[Page886-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>and simple. Moreover there is the maxim that a man
<div n="lb"/>without a son has no right to aspire for heaven. Sad
<div n="lb"/>and silent, thinking of these things he walked on unwill-
<div n="lb"/>ingly and reached the vicinity of the Himālayas. Still,
<div n="lb"/>he was doubtful. He began to consider about the deity,
<div n="lb"/>before whom he had to do penance for the fulfilment of
<div n="lb"/>his wish. He could not decide. As he was sitting in
<div n="lb"/>thought, Nārada came there. From the talk of Vyāsa,
<div n="lb"/>Nārada knew that childlessness was the cause of his
<div n="lb"/>sorrow. Nārada advised him that for the attainment of
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣārthas (objects of life) penance was to be done
<div n="lb"/>before Devī. Accepting that advice, Vyāsa went to a
<div n="lb"/>place near Mahāmeru to do penance.
<div n="NI"/>When Vyāsa began penance, the celestial maids also
<div n="lb"/>commenced their work of hindering the penance. It was
<div n="lb"/>Ghṛtācī who confronted Vyāsa. She took the form of a
<div n="lb"/>parrot of five colours and flew in front of Vyāsa. The
<div n="lb"/>hermit was excited at the beauty of Ghṛtācī and sat
<div n="lb"/>forgetting himself. As he sat there thinking of the infat-
<div n="lb"/>uating beauty of the parrot, seminal discharge occurred
<div n="lb"/>to him. He became a slave to this infatuation, when he
<div n="lb"/>was engaged in making fire by attrition. In this
<div n="lb"/>amorous state of mind he was quite unaware of the
<div n="lb"/>seminal discharge or its falling on the pieces of wood
<div n="lb"/>used for attrition. He continued attrition. Then a very
<div n="lb"/>bright, divine person appeared from the pieces of wood.
<div n="lb"/>At the birth of a person, without attachment to a womb,
<div n="lb"/>all the worlds were delighted. The hide of black ante-
<div n="lb"/>lope, water pot, hermit's rod etc. fell from the sky.
<div n="lb"/>Birth rituals and ceremonies, according to the custom,
<div n="lb"/>were conducted by Vyāsa. As he was born from the
<div n="lb"/>semen discharged at the sight of the Śuka (parrot) the
<div n="lb"/>infant was named Śuka. As soon as he was born Śuka
<div n="lb"/>began to grow by divine power and shortly became a
<div n="lb"/>boy of shining radiance. After investiture with the
<div n="lb"/>Brahma-string, the boy was sent for education to the
<div n="lb"/>hermitage of Bṛhaspati, the teacher of the devas. Śuka
<div n="lb"/>completed his education with Bṛhaspati and having
<div n="lb"/>performed Samāvarta and offering of gift to the teacher,
<div n="lb"/>he returned home to his father.
<div n="NI"/>{%iv) Disciples.%} Śuka commenced advanced study under
<div n="lb"/>his father Vyāsa. Besides Śuka, Vyāsa had disciples such
<div n="lb"/>as Vaiśampāyana, Sūta, Paila, Jaimini and others also,
<div n="lb"/>living with him. The hermitage of Vyāsa soon grew up
<div n="lb"/>to be a great educational institution, with plenty of dis-
<div n="lb"/>ciples.
<div n="NI"/>{%v) Separation of son.%} In the meanwhile Śuka married and
<div n="lb"/>lived the life of a householder in the hermitage of his
<div n="lb"/>father, for a time. Then forsaking his family and his
<div n="lb"/>father, Śuka went to the peak of Kailāsa and began to
<div n="lb"/>do penance meditating on Śiva. At last he became a
<div n="lb"/>divine person who had obtained complete attainments,
<div n="lb"/>and breaking the top of the peak open, he rose up into
<div n="lb"/>the sky and shone there as a second Sun. The devas who
<div n="lb"/>saw Śuka rising up by breaking the peak of Kailāsa and
<div n="lb"/>staying up in the sky, praised him.
<div n="NI"/>This untimely separation of his son had undermined the
<div n="lb"/>firmness of the mind of Vyāsa. Filled with grief, he left
<div n="lb"/>his hermitage and wandered here and there calling out
<div n="lb"/>his son by name. He could not find his son. At last he
<div n="lb"/>reached the peak of Kailāsa where his son had been
<div n="lb"/>doing penance. Standing there he called aloud his son
<div n="lb"/>by name cryingly. Paramaśiva appeared before the
<div n="lb"/>lamenting father and consoled him. Thus getting a little
<div n="lb"/>bit of peace of mind, Vyāsa returned to his hermitage
[Page886-b+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>and lived there. The sorrowing Vyāsa, was made still
<div n="lb"/>more sorrowful by the departure of his beloved disciples,
<div n="lb"/>Asita, Devala, Vaiśampāyana, Sumantu, Jaimini and
<div n="lb"/>others who had been living in the hermitage and who
<div n="lb"/>had departed, having finished their education. All the
<div n="lb"/>surroundings of the hermitage seemed to him filled
<div n="lb"/>with pain. At last he thought about his mother.
<div n="lb"/>(Devī Bhāgavata Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%His terrestrial life.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%i) Preface.%} Within this period many changes had
<div n="lb"/>taken place in Hastināpura and the bank of Yamunā.
<div n="lb"/>Śantanu the king of the Lunar dynasty had married
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgādevī, who had disappeared after giving the king
<div n="lb"/>a son named Devavrata (Bhīṣma). Bhīṣma grew up.
<div n="lb"/>Once Śantanu was hunting in the forest when he was
<div n="lb"/>attracted by the sweet smell of musk. Tracing the
<div n="lb"/>origin of that smell, the king reached the fisherman's
<div n="lb"/>hut on the banks of the Yamunā. That smell proceeded
<div n="lb"/>from Kastūrigandhā (Satyavatī) the mother of Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>The king fell in love with her. He returned to the
<div n="lb"/>palace, sad and silent. Learning the cause of his father's
<div n="lb"/>sadness, Devavrata went to the fisherman's hut and took
<div n="lb"/>Śatyavatī to the palace to be given to his father. Deva-
<div n="lb"/>vrata had taken a vow that the kingdom would be given
<div n="lb"/>to the son born to Satyavatī and that he would remain
<div n="lb"/>unmarried, throughout his life. Because he had taken
<div n="lb"/>so terrible a vow, Devavrata came to be called Bhīṣma
<div n="lb"/>from that day onwards.
<div n="NI"/>Two sons named Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya, were
<div n="lb"/>born to Śantanu. Citrāṅgada died when he was young.
<div n="lb"/>Vicitravīrya married Ambikā and Ambālikā, daughters
<div n="lb"/>of the King of Kāśī. Vicitravīrya also died before any
<div n="lb"/>children were born to him. It seemed as if the family
<div n="lb"/>was about to become extinct. At this juncture Satyavatī
<div n="lb"/>thought about her son Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%Vyāsa in Hastināpurī.%} The mother thought about
<div n="lb"/>him, and instantly he reached Hastināpurī. Because of
<div n="lb"/>her compulsion, two sons were born, one each to Ambi-
<div n="lb"/>kā and Ambālikā from Vyāsa. The son of Ambikā was
<div n="lb"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the son of Ambālikā was Pāṇḍu. Vid-
<div n="lb"/>ura was the son born to Vyāsa by their maid.
<div n="NI"/>iii) {%Vyāsa and the Kaurava-Pāṇḍavas.%} From this time
<div n="lb"/>onwards we see Vyāsa as the spiritual teacher of the
<div n="lb"/>Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas. Behind all the movements
<div n="lb"/>of these two families we could see the hand of Vyāsa.
<div n="lb"/>Thus though he came to Hastināpurī and gave advice
<div n="lb"/>to the members of the family frequently, his main abode
<div n="lb"/>was his hermitage. Vyāsa's contact with Hastināpura
<div n="lb"/>could be seen up to the Mahāprasthāna (the great
<div n="lb"/>departure) of the Pāṇḍavas. In all the administrative
<div n="lb"/>affairs up to this period, Vyāsa also had a part. The
<div n="lb"/>situations in which Vyāsa had taken part in the life-
<div n="lb"/>voyage of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas are given
<div n="lb"/>below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Vyāsa gave the boon that hundred sons would be
<div n="lb"/>born to Gāndhārī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 114,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Vyāsa cut the mass of flesh given birth to by
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārī into a hundred pieces and kept them in
<div n="lb"/>hundred pots. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 114, Stanza
<div n="lb"/>17).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Vyāsa consoled Gāndhārī by telling her that over
<div n="lb"/>and above hundred sons a daughter also would be born
<div n="lb"/>to her. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 115, Stanza 16).
[Page887-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Vyāsa consoled the Pāṇḍavas who had been
<div n="lb"/>living in the forest with their mother Kuntī, after the
<div n="lb"/>death of Pāṇḍu their father. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 155, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>(v) On another occasion Vyāsa came to the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>and told them the stories of the previous births of
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcālī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 168).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Vyāsa rendered all possible help to the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>to marry Pāñcālī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 195).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Very often Vyāsa was a member of the council
<div n="lb"/>of Dharmaputra. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) It was Vyāsa who sent Arjuna to the north,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīmasena to the east, Sahadeva to the south and
<div n="lb"/>Nakula to the west for regional conquest. (M.B. Sabhā
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha, Chapter 26).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) Vyāsa engaged himself in making various arrange-
<div n="lb"/>ments in the Rājasūya (sacrifice of royal consecration)
<div n="lb"/>of Yudhiṣṭhira. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 33,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 34).
<div n="NI"/>(x) At the end of the Rājasūya, Vyāsa predicted the
<div n="lb"/>future of Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 46,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 1).
<div n="NI"/>(xi) When the Rājasūya ended, Vyāsa anointed
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) Vyāsa advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to prevent Duryodhana
<div n="lb"/>from doing injustice. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 7
<div n="lb"/>and 8).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) When the Pāṇḍavas were living in the Dvaita-
<div n="lb"/>vana (forest) Vyāsa visited them and taught Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira the art of Pratismṛti. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>36, Stanza 24).
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) He sent Sañjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra to tell him about
<div n="lb"/>the greatness of Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Udyoga
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 69, Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>(xv) He gave Sañjaya the power of having the eye of a
<div n="lb"/>seer penetrating beyond time and space (Divya dṛṣṭi).
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 2, Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(xvi) Vyāsa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira who was stricken
<div n="lb"/>with grief in the course of the battle of Bhārata. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa Parva, Chapter 71, Stanza 23).
<div n="NI"/>(xvii) When Yudhiṣṭhira cried over the death of
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca in the battle of Bhārata, Vyāsa came to
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira and consoled him. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 183, Stanza 58).
<div n="NI"/>(xviii) He talked to Aśvatthāmā about the greatness of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva and Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 201,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 56).
<div n="NI"/>(xix) When Sātyaki was about to kill Sañjaya, Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>turned him back from the attempt and rescued Sañjaya.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 29, Stanza 39).
<div n="NI"/>(xx) Vyāsa argued and established that the act of
<div n="lb"/>cursing Aśvatthāmā on the part of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was
<div n="lb"/>correct. (M.B. Sauptika Parva, Chapter 16, Stanza 17).
<div n="NI"/>(xxi) Vyāsa prevented Gāndhārī from her intention to
<div n="lb"/>curse the Pāṇḍavas. (M.B. Strī Parva, Chapter 14,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(xxii) When the battle of Bhārata was over, Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>advised Yudhiṣṭhira about matters regarding the
<div n="lb"/>administration of the country.
<div n="NI"/>(xxiii) Yudhiṣṭhira felt grieved at the death of relatives
<div n="lb"/>and friends in the battle of Bhārata and he decided to
<div n="lb"/>commit suicide. But Vyāsa dissuaded him from that
<div n="lb"/>attempt. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 27, Stanza 28).
[Page887-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(xxiv) Vyāsa walked to the place where Bhīṣma lay on
<div n="lb"/>the bed of arrows and visited him. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 45, Stanza 5).
<div n="NI"/>(xxv) Vyāsa advised Yudhiṣṭhira to perform Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha (horse sacrifice). (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 3, Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(xxvi) Vyāsa advised the Pāṇḍavas to go to King
<div n="lb"/>Marutta for wealth when the battle of Bhārata was
<div n="lb"/>over. (Aśvamedhika Parva, Chapter 3, Stanza 20).
<div n="NI"/>(xxvii) Vyāsa consoled Uttarā, who was lamenting
<div n="lb"/>over the death of her husband. (Aśvamedha Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 62, Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>(xxviii) He consoled Arjuna who was crying over the
<div n="lb"/>death of his son. (Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 62,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 14).
<div n="NI"/>(xxix) Vyāsa advised Yudhiṣṭhira on the various
<div n="lb"/>arrangements which were to be made for the conducting
<div n="lb"/>of horse-sacrifice. (Aśvamedhika Parva, Chapters 62 to
<div n="lb"/>72).
<div n="NI"/>(xxx) Vyāsa went to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who had gone to the
<div n="lb"/>forest after the Bhārata-battle and pacified him. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 28).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxi) Vyāsa brought the spirits of those who died in
<div n="lb"/>the Bhārata-battle, to the surface of the river Ganges,
<div n="lb"/>by the power of his penance and Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the
<div n="lb"/>others saw them. (See under Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Para 7).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxii) At the instruction of Vyāsa, all the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>widows immersed themselves in the river Ganges and
<div n="lb"/>everyone of them entered the world of her husband.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 33, Stanza 18).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxiii) When the Yadu-clan was completely destroyed,
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna went to the hermitage of Vyāsa and talked with
<div n="lb"/>him. (Mausala Parva, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxiv) Vyāsa had been an adviser of King Janame-
<div n="lb"/>jaya. (See under Janamejaya).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Saving a worm.%} Once a wicked man took rebirth as
<div n="lb"/>a worm. This worm was crawling in haste for life in
<div n="lb"/>front of a cart coming at great speed. He saved the
<div n="lb"/>worm and gave it Brahminhood, and in the next birth
<div n="lb"/>it became a Brahmin who lived in peace and comfort.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 117).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The literary life of Vyāsa.%} Towards the close of his
<div n="lb"/>life Vyāsa again entered the caves of Himālayas. Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>who had steered through a very wide and rough sea of
<div n="lb"/>life, was in a position to understand clearly the
<div n="lb"/>various sides of human life. In the mind of that sage,
<div n="lb"/>who sat in deep contemplation in the eternally silent
<div n="lb"/>caves of the Himālayas, the events of his past life began
<div n="lb"/>to line up one after the other. From that inward insti-
<div n="lb"/>gation the Purāṇetihāsas (the Myths and legends) took
<div n="lb"/>form. It might have been during this period that Vyāsa
<div n="lb"/>divided the Vedas and composed Purāṇas and Upa-
<div n="lb"/>purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>One does not go wrong in saying that it was the com-
<div n="lb"/>posing of the Mahābhārata that brought Vyāsa very
<div n="lb"/>close to the later generations. The stories of the Kaura-
<div n="lb"/>vas and the Pāṇḍavas, flowed through his mind as a
<div n="lb"/>river flows down crushing down the banks on either
<div n="lb"/>side. A scribe was necessary to take them down in the
<div n="lb"/>form of verses. Vyāsa informed Brahmā of this need.
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā replied “Gaṇapati is the only person capable
<div n="lb"/>of taking down every thing that you sing.” Accordingly
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa thought of Gaṇapati, who came to the side of
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa, and he informed Gaṇapati of his need. Gaṇapati
<div n="lb"/>said that he was willing to do the work on condition
[Page888-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>that Vyāsa would go on singing unceasingly, so that he
<div n="lb"/>might not have to stop the iron pen. Vyāsa said that
<div n="lb"/>while he would be singing the poems without stopping,
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇapati should not take down this and that without
<div n="lb"/>grasping the meaning. Both agreed to this condition
<div n="lb"/>and the composing of the Mahābhārata commenced.
<div n="lb"/>Within two years and a half the great poetic work was
<div n="lb"/>finished. The great disciples of Vyāsa, such as Vaiśam-
<div n="lb"/>pāyana, Jaimini and such others sang them and learned
<div n="lb"/>them by heart and published them in the world. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Many Vyāsas.%} It is stated in the Purāṇas that in
<div n="lb"/>every Manu's age, a Vyāsa will be born. It is mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed in Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter 3, as to who
<div n="lb"/>were the persons who took birth as Vyāsa in a parti-
<div n="lb"/>cular Manu's age and which were the Vedas and
<div n="lb"/>branches of Vedas they had divided. It is given below:
<div n="lb"/>During the age of Manu Vaivasvata, in each of the
<div n="lb"/>past Dvāparayugas, the Veda had been divided by
<div n="lb"/>great hermits, twentyeight times. Twentyeight Veda-
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsas have passed, each of whom had divided the
<div n="lb"/>Veda into four parts in each Dvāpara Yuga. It was
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā himself who had divided the Veda into four in
<div n="lb"/>the first Dvāparayuga. Prajāpati was the Vedavyāsa in
<div n="lb"/>the second Dvāparayuga. In the third, Vyāsa was the
<div n="lb"/>teacher-priest Śukra; in the fourth Bṛhaspati; in the
<div n="lb"/>fifth the Sun; and in the sixth the all powerful Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>rāja. It was Indra in the seventh, Vasiṣṭha in the
<div n="lb"/>eighth, Sārasvata in the ninth, and Tridhāmā in the
<div n="lb"/>tenth. It was Triśikha in the eleventh, Bharadvāja in
<div n="lb"/>the twelfth, Antarīkṣa in the thirteenth, Varṇī in the
<div n="lb"/>fourteenth, Trayyāruṇa in the fifteenth, Dhanañjaya in
<div n="lb"/>the sixteenth, Kratuñjaya in the seventeenth and Jaya
<div n="lb"/>in the eighteenth. Next Bharadvāja comes as Vedavyāsa
<div n="lb"/>and Gautama after Bharadvāja. It was hermit Haryā-
<div n="lb"/>tmā who was the next Vyāsa, and then comes Vājaśra-
<div n="lb"/>vas. The Next Vyāsa was Tṛṇabindu born in the clan
<div n="lb"/>of Somaśuṣma. He was followed by Ṛkṣa. otherwise
<div n="lb"/>called Vālmīki born in the family of Bhṛgu. Śakti is
<div n="lb"/>the Next Vyāsa. After that Parāśara, then Jātūkarṇa
<div n="lb"/>and then Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana. They are the twentyeight
<div n="lb"/>Vedavyāsas. Each one of these had divided the Veda
<div n="lb"/>which had been one at the beginning of each Dvāpara-
<div n="lb"/>yuga, into four Vedas. It is Aśvatthāmā, the son of
<div n="lb"/>Droṇa, who is going to be the Vedavyāśa of the coming
<div n="lb"/>Dvāparayuga.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Most of the scholars are of opinion that the period
<div n="lb"/>of Vyāsa was between 1800 and 1500 B.C.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Apāntaratamas was the rebirth of Vyāsa. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Apāntaratamas).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In Mahābhārata, the word Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇadvaipā-
<div n="lb"/>yana, Dvaipāyana, Satyavatīsuta, Satyavatyātmaja,
<div n="lb"/>Pārāśarya, Parāśarātmaja, Bādarāyaṇa, Vedavyāsa etc.
<div n="lb"/>are used as synonyms of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) The word Vyāsa means he who describes elabora-
<div n="lb"/>tely.
<div n="NI"/>“He became Vyāsa because he had described all the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas”. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 63, Stanza 88).
<div n="lb"/>Vyas = describe (Differentiate the branches and divide).
