VYĀSA¦. The sage Vyāsa who is the author of the Mahā-
Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
order: Brahmā-Vasiṣṭha-Śakti-Parāśara-Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Vyāsa was born to hermit Parāśara by a fisher-
woman named Kālī. His name when he was a child
was Kṛṣṇa. As his birth took place in an island (Dvīpa)
he got the name Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana. After dividing the
Vedas he got the name Vedavyāsa. He is the composer
of Mahābhārata, one of the greatest books in world-
literature. The births of great men, generally will be
wonderful. Behind the birth of Vyāsa also there is a
wonderful story.
<div n="NI"/>As has already been mentioned, Kālī, a fisherwoman
was the mother of Vyāsa. There is a story about this
Kālī also. When king Vasu of Cedi went to the forest
for hunting, he saw the coition of animals and he had
seminal discharge. The king sent that semen to his
queen. But on the way it fell in the river Kālindī and
was eaten by a fish. This fish was a celestial maid
named Adrikā transformed to fish by a curse. The fish
conceived and got into the net of a fisherman, who lived
on the banks of Kālindī. When this fish was cut open
a male and a female infant were seen inside. The male
child was given to the king himself. The fisherman
brought up the girl naming her Kālī. As the girl had
the gandha (smell) of matsya (fish), she got the name
‘Matsya-gandhā’, also. This fisherman was also a ferry-
man. Kālī used to help her father in ferrying people
across the river Kālindī. She grew up and became a
young woman.
<div n="NI"/>Once the hermit Parasara came by that way to go to
the other side of the river. At that time, the fisherman
who has been taking people across the river, was sitting
on the bank of the river and having his meals. As soon
as Parāśara came, the innocent fisherman—the foster-
father of Matsyagandhā—called her, who was standing
close by and asked her to take the hermit across the
[Page885-b+ 65]
river. The hermit got into the boat. Matsyagandhā
began to row the boat. The beauty of the damsel sitting
in front of him and the little waves of the river, com-
bined together had the effect of arousing passion in the
hermit. He became sexually excited and sat close to her.
Discerning his intention she moved away from him and
prayed to him humbly not to violate her chastity. She
repeated her prayer. The hermit Parāśara created an
artificial fog around the boat. The smell of fish was
gone from her and the fragrance of Musk took its place.
The hermit created an artificial island in the middle of
the river. They got down on the island and acted a love
drama. She became pregnant. Parāśara said to her.
“Beautiful girl! Even after your confinement you shall
remain a virgin. A son, who will be a portion of Viṣṇu,
a man of purity, famous throughout the three worlds,
highly learned, the teacher-priest of the whole world,
shall be born to you. He will divide the Vedas and will
be exalted by the people of the world.”
<div n="NI"/>After this the great hermit took his bath in Yamunā and
went away. The pregnancy of Kālī was completed in-
stantly and she gave birth to a very handsome boy in
that island of Yamunā. As soon as he was born, he grew
up and became a hermit radiant with devotion and as-
suming a vow of purity and abstinence he said to his
mother. “Mother! You can go anywhere, as you please.
You need have no worry on my account. I am about to
go for penance. When anything unpleasant happens to
you, just think of me. The moment you wish to see me,
I will be there by you. I wish you a happy life. I am
going.” Saying thus the brave boy walked away. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 2; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapters 60 to 63).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Spiritual life.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%i) Introduction.%} Two sides, the spiritual as well as the
material, are seen in the life of Vyāsa. It was after the
marriage of Śantanu, a king of the Lunar dynasty, with
his mother Kālī, otherwise known as Satyavatī, that
Vyāsa came into contact with Hastināpura. Participating
in all the vicissitudes of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas
was the worldly side of the life of Vyāsa. But the major
part of his life was spent in living as a hermit in his
hermitage in the forest with a large group of disciples;
teaching them the Vedas. A small description of that
spiritual life is given below:
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%In the forest.%} We do not see Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana, who
had grown up to a youth at the time of his birth, for
many years after his departure, bidding adieu to his
mother. He might have been living with hermits in the
forests, learning Vedas from them. After this he appears
on the banks of river Sarasvatī as a teacher and Priest.
As he was doing penance there, he saw two sparrows,
legs and beaks red, without even down feathers, crying
for food, and the parent birds, with the utmost care and
tenderness feeding them. They flew about here and there
and gathered food and came back quickly. Because of
joy at the sight of their parents, the little ones opened
their ruby-red mouths with cries and throbbing. They
kissed the young ones and fed them. The young spar-
rows hid under the wings of their father and mother
and enjoyed the surroundings by thrusting out their
heads and looking on all sides.
<div n="NI"/>{%iii) Birth of son.%} Seeing this, the paternity instinct in
him was aroused. He understood that love of children
was merely for the sake of love, that this love was pure
[Page886-a+ 65]
and simple. Moreover there is the maxim that a man
without a son has no right to aspire for heaven. Sad
and silent, thinking of these things he walked on unwill-
ingly and reached the vicinity of the Himālayas. Still,
he was doubtful. He began to consider about the deity,
before whom he had to do penance for the fulfilment of
his wish. He could not decide. As he was sitting in
thought, Nārada came there. From the talk of Vyāsa,
Nārada knew that childlessness was the cause of his
sorrow. Nārada advised him that for the attainment of
Puruṣārthas (objects of life) penance was to be done
before Devī. Accepting that advice, Vyāsa went to a
place near Mahāmeru to do penance.
<div n="NI"/>When Vyāsa began penance, the celestial maids also
commenced their work of hindering the penance. It was
Ghṛtācī who confronted Vyāsa. She took the form of a
parrot of five colours and flew in front of Vyāsa. The
hermit was excited at the beauty of Ghṛtācī and sat
forgetting himself. As he sat there thinking of the infat-
uating beauty of the parrot, seminal discharge occurred
to him. He became a slave to this infatuation, when he
was engaged in making fire by attrition. In this
amorous state of mind he was quite unaware of the
seminal discharge or its falling on the pieces of wood
used for attrition. He continued attrition. Then a very
bright, divine person appeared from the pieces of wood.
At the birth of a person, without attachment to a womb,
all the worlds were delighted. The hide of black ante-
lope, water pot, hermit's rod etc. fell from the sky.
Birth rituals and ceremonies, according to the custom,
were conducted by Vyāsa. As he was born from the
semen discharged at the sight of the Śuka (parrot) the
infant was named Śuka. As soon as he was born Śuka
began to grow by divine power and shortly became a
boy of shining radiance. After investiture with the
Brahma-string, the boy was sent for education to the
hermitage of Bṛhaspati, the teacher of the devas. Śuka
completed his education with Bṛhaspati and having
performed Samāvarta and offering of gift to the teacher,
he returned home to his father.
<div n="NI"/>{%iv) Disciples.%} Śuka commenced advanced study under
his father Vyāsa. Besides Śuka, Vyāsa had disciples such
as Vaiśampāyana, Sūta, Paila, Jaimini and others also,
living with him. The hermitage of Vyāsa soon grew up
to be a great educational institution, with plenty of dis-
ciples.
<div n="NI"/>{%v) Separation of son.%} In the meanwhile Śuka married and
lived the life of a householder in the hermitage of his
father, for a time. Then forsaking his family and his
father, Śuka went to the peak of Kailāsa and began to
do penance meditating on Śiva. At last he became a
divine person who had obtained complete attainments,
and breaking the top of the peak open, he rose up into
the sky and shone there as a second Sun. The devas who
saw Śuka rising up by breaking the peak of Kailāsa and
staying up in the sky, praised him.
<div n="NI"/>This untimely separation of his son had undermined the
firmness of the mind of Vyāsa. Filled with grief, he left
his hermitage and wandered here and there calling out
his son by name. He could not find his son. At last he
reached the peak of Kailāsa where his son had been
doing penance. Standing there he called aloud his son
by name cryingly. Paramaśiva appeared before the
lamenting father and consoled him. Thus getting a little
bit of peace of mind, Vyāsa returned to his hermitage
[Page886-b+ 64]
and lived there. The sorrowing Vyāsa, was made still
more sorrowful by the departure of his beloved disciples,
Asita, Devala, Vaiśampāyana, Sumantu, Jaimini and
others who had been living in the hermitage and who
had departed, having finished their education. All the
surroundings of the hermitage seemed to him filled
with pain. At last he thought about his mother.
(Devī Bhāgavata Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%His terrestrial life.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%i) Preface.%} Within this period many changes had
taken place in Hastināpura and the bank of Yamunā.
Śantanu the king of the Lunar dynasty had married
Gaṅgādevī, who had disappeared after giving the king
a son named Devavrata (Bhīṣma). Bhīṣma grew up.
Once Śantanu was hunting in the forest when he was
attracted by the sweet smell of musk. Tracing the
origin of that smell, the king reached the fisherman's
hut on the banks of the Yamunā. That smell proceeded
from Kastūrigandhā (Satyavatī) the mother of Vyāsa.
The king fell in love with her. He returned to the
palace, sad and silent. Learning the cause of his father's
sadness, Devavrata went to the fisherman's hut and took
Śatyavatī to the palace to be given to his father. Deva-
vrata had taken a vow that the kingdom would be given
to the son born to Satyavatī and that he would remain
unmarried, throughout his life. Because he had taken
so terrible a vow, Devavrata came to be called Bhīṣma
from that day onwards.
<div n="NI"/>Two sons named Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya, were
born to Śantanu. Citrāṅgada died when he was young.
Vicitravīrya married Ambikā and Ambālikā, daughters
of the King of Kāśī. Vicitravīrya also died before any
children were born to him. It seemed as if the family
was about to become extinct. At this juncture Satyavatī
thought about her son Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%Vyāsa in Hastināpurī.%} The mother thought about
him, and instantly he reached Hastināpurī. Because of
her compulsion, two sons were born, one each to Ambi-
kā and Ambālikā from Vyāsa. The son of Ambikā was
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the son of Ambālikā was Pāṇḍu. Vid-
ura was the son born to Vyāsa by their maid.
<div n="NI"/>iii) {%Vyāsa and the Kaurava-Pāṇḍavas.%} From this time
onwards we see Vyāsa as the spiritual teacher of the
Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas. Behind all the movements
of these two families we could see the hand of Vyāsa.
Thus though he came to Hastināpurī and gave advice
to the members of the family frequently, his main abode
was his hermitage. Vyāsa's contact with Hastināpura
could be seen up to the Mahāprasthāna (the great
departure) of the Pāṇḍavas. In all the administrative
affairs up to this period, Vyāsa also had a part. The
situations in which Vyāsa had taken part in the life-
voyage of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas are given
below.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Vyāsa gave the boon that hundred sons would be
born to Gāndhārī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 114,
Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Vyāsa cut the mass of flesh given birth to by
Gāndhārī into a hundred pieces and kept them in
hundred pots. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 114, Stanza
17).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Vyāsa consoled Gāndhārī by telling her that over
and above hundred sons a daughter also would be born
to her. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 115, Stanza 16).
[Page887-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Vyāsa consoled the Pāṇḍavas who had been
living in the forest with their mother Kuntī, after the
death of Pāṇḍu their father. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 155, Verse 5).
<div n="NI"/>(v) On another occasion Vyāsa came to the Pāṇḍavas
and told them the stories of the previous births of
Pāñcālī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 168).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Vyāsa rendered all possible help to the Pāṇḍavas
to marry Pāñcālī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 195).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Very often Vyāsa was a member of the council
of Dharmaputra. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4,
Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) It was Vyāsa who sent Arjuna to the north,
Bhīmasena to the east, Sahadeva to the south and
Nakula to the west for regional conquest. (M.B. Sabhā
Parva, Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha, Chapter 26).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) Vyāsa engaged himself in making various arrange-
ments in the Rājasūya (sacrifice of royal consecration)
of Yudhiṣṭhira. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 33,
Stanza 34).
<div n="NI"/>(x) At the end of the Rājasūya, Vyāsa predicted the
future of Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 46,
Stanza 1).
<div n="NI"/>(xi) When the Rājasūya ended, Vyāsa anointed
Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) Vyāsa advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to prevent Duryodhana
from doing injustice. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 7
and 8).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) When the Pāṇḍavas were living in the Dvaita-
vana (forest) Vyāsa visited them and taught Yudhi-
ṣṭhira the art of Pratismṛti. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
36, Stanza 24).
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) He sent Sañjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra to tell him about
the greatness of Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Udyoga
Parva, Chapter 69, Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>(xv) He gave Sañjaya the power of having the eye of a
seer penetrating beyond time and space (Divya dṛṣṭi).
(M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 2, Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(xvi) Vyāsa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira who was stricken
with grief in the course of the battle of Bhārata. (M.B.
Droṇa Parva, Chapter 71, Stanza 23).
<div n="NI"/>(xvii) When Yudhiṣṭhira cried over the death of
Ghaṭotkaca in the battle of Bhārata, Vyāsa came to
Yudhiṣṭhira and consoled him. (M.B. Droṇa Parva,
Chapter 183, Stanza 58).
<div n="NI"/>(xviii) He talked to Aśvatthāmā about the greatness of
Śiva and Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 201,
Stanza 56).
<div n="NI"/>(xix) When Sātyaki was about to kill Sañjaya, Vyāsa
turned him back from the attempt and rescued Sañjaya.
(M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 29, Stanza 39).
<div n="NI"/>(xx) Vyāsa argued and established that the act of
cursing Aśvatthāmā on the part of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was
correct. (M.B. Sauptika Parva, Chapter 16, Stanza 17).
<div n="NI"/>(xxi) Vyāsa prevented Gāndhārī from her intention to
curse the Pāṇḍavas. (M.B. Strī Parva, Chapter 14,
Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(xxii) When the battle of Bhārata was over, Vyāsa
advised Yudhiṣṭhira about matters regarding the
administration of the country.
<div n="NI"/>(xxiii) Yudhiṣṭhira felt grieved at the death of relatives
and friends in the battle of Bhārata and he decided to
commit suicide. But Vyāsa dissuaded him from that
attempt. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 27, Stanza 28).
[Page887-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(xxiv) Vyāsa walked to the place where Bhīṣma lay on
the bed of arrows and visited him. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 45, Stanza 5).
<div n="NI"/>(xxv) Vyāsa advised Yudhiṣṭhira to perform Aśva-
medha (horse sacrifice). (M.B. Aśvamedha Parva,
Chapter 3, Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(xxvi) Vyāsa advised the Pāṇḍavas to go to King
Marutta for wealth when the battle of Bhārata was
over. (Aśvamedhika Parva, Chapter 3, Stanza 20).
<div n="NI"/>(xxvii) Vyāsa consoled Uttarā, who was lamenting
over the death of her husband. (Aśvamedha Parva,
Chapter 62, Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>(xxviii) He consoled Arjuna who was crying over the
death of his son. (Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 62,
Stanza 14).
<div n="NI"/>(xxix) Vyāsa advised Yudhiṣṭhira on the various
arrangements which were to be made for the conducting
of horse-sacrifice. (Aśvamedhika Parva, Chapters 62 to
72).
<div n="NI"/>(xxx) Vyāsa went to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who had gone to the
forest after the Bhārata-battle and pacified him. (M.B.
Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 28).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxi) Vyāsa brought the spirits of those who died in
the Bhārata-battle, to the surface of the river Ganges,
by the power of his penance and Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the
others saw them. (See under Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Para 7).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxii) At the instruction of Vyāsa, all the Kṣatriya
widows immersed themselves in the river Ganges and
everyone of them entered the world of her husband.
(M.B. Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 33, Stanza 18).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxiii) When the Yadu-clan was completely destroyed,
Arjuna went to the hermitage of Vyāsa and talked with
him. (Mausala Parva, Chapter 8).
<div n="NI"/>(xxxiv) Vyāsa had been an adviser of King Janame-
jaya. (See under Janamejaya).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Saving a worm.%} Once a wicked man took rebirth as
a worm. This worm was crawling in haste for life in
front of a cart coming at great speed. He saved the
worm and gave it Brahminhood, and in the next birth
it became a Brahmin who lived in peace and comfort.
(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 117).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The literary life of Vyāsa.%} Towards the close of his
life Vyāsa again entered the caves of Himālayas. Vyāsa
who had steered through a very wide and rough sea of
life, was in a position to understand clearly the
various sides of human life. In the mind of that sage,
who sat in deep contemplation in the eternally silent
caves of the Himālayas, the events of his past life began
to line up one after the other. From that inward insti-
gation the Purāṇetihāsas (the Myths and legends) took
form. It might have been during this period that Vyāsa
divided the Vedas and composed Purāṇas and Upa-
purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>One does not go wrong in saying that it was the com-
posing of the Mahābhārata that brought Vyāsa very
close to the later generations. The stories of the Kaura-
vas and the Pāṇḍavas, flowed through his mind as a
river flows down crushing down the banks on either
side. A scribe was necessary to take them down in the
form of verses. Vyāsa informed Brahmā of this need.
Brahmā replied “Gaṇapati is the only person capable
of taking down every thing that you sing.” Accordingly
Vyāsa thought of Gaṇapati, who came to the side of
Vyāsa, and he informed Gaṇapati of his need. Gaṇapati
said that he was willing to do the work on condition
[Page888-a+ 64]
that Vyāsa would go on singing unceasingly, so that he
might not have to stop the iron pen. Vyāsa said that
while he would be singing the poems without stopping,
Gaṇapati should not take down this and that without
grasping the meaning. Both agreed to this condition
and the composing of the Mahābhārata commenced.
Within two years and a half the great poetic work was
finished. The great disciples of Vyāsa, such as Vaiśam-
pāyana, Jaimini and such others sang them and learned
them by heart and published them in the world. (M.B.
Ādi Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Many Vyāsas.%} It is stated in the Purāṇas that in
every Manu's age, a Vyāsa will be born. It is mention-
ed in Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter 3, as to who
were the persons who took birth as Vyāsa in a parti-
cular Manu's age and which were the Vedas and
branches of Vedas they had divided. It is given below:
During the age of Manu Vaivasvata, in each of the
past Dvāparayugas, the Veda had been divided by
great hermits, twentyeight times. Twentyeight Veda-
Vyāsas have passed, each of whom had divided the
Veda into four parts in each Dvāpara Yuga. It was
Brahmā himself who had divided the Veda into four in
the first Dvāparayuga. Prajāpati was the Vedavyāsa in
the second Dvāparayuga. In the third, Vyāsa was the
teacher-priest Śukra; in the fourth Bṛhaspati; in the
fifth the Sun; and in the sixth the all powerful Dharma-
rāja. It was Indra in the seventh, Vasiṣṭha in the
eighth, Sārasvata in the ninth, and Tridhāmā in the
tenth. It was Triśikha in the eleventh, Bharadvāja in
the twelfth, Antarīkṣa in the thirteenth, Varṇī in the
fourteenth, Trayyāruṇa in the fifteenth, Dhanañjaya in
the sixteenth, Kratuñjaya in the seventeenth and Jaya
in the eighteenth. Next Bharadvāja comes as Vedavyāsa
and Gautama after Bharadvāja. It was hermit Haryā-
tmā who was the next Vyāsa, and then comes Vājaśra-
vas. The Next Vyāsa was Tṛṇabindu born in the clan
of Somaśuṣma. He was followed by Ṛkṣa. otherwise
called Vālmīki born in the family of Bhṛgu. Śakti is
the Next Vyāsa. After that Parāśara, then Jātūkarṇa
and then Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana. They are the twentyeight
Vedavyāsas. Each one of these had divided the Veda
which had been one at the beginning of each Dvāpara-
yuga, into four Vedas. It is Aśvatthāmā, the son of
Droṇa, who is going to be the Vedavyāśa of the coming
Dvāparayuga.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Most of the scholars are of opinion that the period
of Vyāsa was between 1800 and 1500 B.C.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Apāntaratamas was the rebirth of Vyāsa. (See
under Apāntaratamas).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In Mahābhārata, the word Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇadvaipā-
yana, Dvaipāyana, Satyavatīsuta, Satyavatyātmaja,
Pārāśarya, Parāśarātmaja, Bādarāyaṇa, Vedavyāsa etc.
are used as synonyms of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) The word Vyāsa means he who describes elabora-
tely.
<div n="NI"/>“He became Vyāsa because he had described all the
Vedas”. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 63, Stanza 88).
