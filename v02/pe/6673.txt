SODARYAVĀN¦. A chariot of Indra. The peculiarity of
this chariot was that two chariot-fighters could sit and
fight at the same time in this. It is mentioned in
Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 24, Verse 12,
that Indra had, sitting in this chariot, killed ninety-
nine asuras (demons). This chariot passed hands from
Indra to Uparicaravasu; from him to Bṛhadratha, and
from this King to Jarāsandha, on whose death, Indra
took possession of it again. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chap-
ter 24, Verse 48).
