<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Birth.%} She was born as the daughter of Karddama
<div n="lb"/>Prajāpati and Devahūti. (See Vasiṣṭha).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Other information.%} (1) Once Arundhatī got suspi-
<div n="lb"/>cious about the character of Vasiṣṭha and as a result
<div n="lb"/>of misunderstanding her chaste husband her beauty
<div n="lb"/>suffered a set-back. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 232,
<div n="lb"/>Verses 27-29).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Arundhatī shone forth in Brahmā's assembly with
<div n="lb"/>other Devīs like, Pṛthvī, Hṛī, Svāhākīrtī, Surā and Śacī.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 41).
<div n="NI"/>(3) She outshone all other chaste women in devotion to
<div n="lb"/>her husband. She owed her great power to her chastity
<div n="lb"/>and service of her husband. (M.B., Araṇya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 225, Verse 15).
<div n="NI"/>(4) The seven great Ṛṣis once offered her an honourable
<div n="lb"/>seat. (M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 226, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>(5) There is a story in the Mahābhārata of how Śiva
<div n="lb"/>once blessed Arundhatī. While the seven great Ṛṣis
<div n="lb"/>were staying at the Himālayas it did not rain consecu-
<div n="lb"/>tively for twelve years, and the Munis suffered much
<div n="lb"/>without either roots or fruits to eat. Then Arundhatī
[Page056-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>began a rigorous tapas, and Śiva appeared before her
<div n="lb"/>disguised as a brahmin. Since, due to the failure of
<div n="lb"/>rains, Arundhatī had no food with her. She cooked food
<div n="lb"/>with some cheap roots and served the guest with it,
<div n="lb"/>and with that it rained profusely all over the land. Śiva
<div n="lb"/>then assumed his own form and blessed Arundhatī,
<div n="lb"/>and from that day onwards it became a sacred spot.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B., Śalya Parva, Chapter 48, Verses 38-54).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Arundhatī once pointed out to Vṛṣdarbhi the evils
<div n="lb"/>of receiving remuneration (fee). (M.B., Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 45).
<div n="NI"/>(7) On another occasion she spoke about the secret
<div n="lb"/>principles of ethics among others. (M.B., Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 130, Verses 3-11).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Once all the Devas eulogized Arundhatī and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>blessed her. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 130,
<div n="lb"/>Verses 12 and 13).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Arundhatī and Vasiṣṭha did tapas at the sacred
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī tīrtha and entered into Samādhi. (M.B.,
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 17).
