once blessed Arundhatī. While the seven great Ṛṣis
were staying at the Himālayas it did not rain consecu-

without either roots or fruits to eat. Then Arundhatī

began a rigorous tapas, and Śiva appeared before her
disguised as a brahmin. Since, due to the failure of
rains, Arundhatī had no food with her. She cooked food
with some cheap roots and served the guest with it,

then assumed his own form and blessed Arundhatī,
and from that day onwards it became a sacred spot.
