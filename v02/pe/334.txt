AÑJANA¦. This is an elephant belonging to the Asuras.
His origin is in the family of Supratīka. The other
three elephants born in this family are: Airāvata,
Vāmana and Kumuda. (This Airāvata was not the
Airāvata of Devendra). There are references to
Rākṣasas coming to the battle-field on the back of
elephants. There is another mention of Añjana the
elephant standing in the battle-field. (M.B., Udyoga
Parva, Chapter 99, Verse 15; Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 64,
Verse 57; Droṇa Parva, Chapter 112, Verse 32).
