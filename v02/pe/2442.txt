GIRIVRAJA¦. A city which has gained great importance
in all the Purāṇas of India.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} There was once a King named Kuśa in the
Pūru dynasty. (For genealogy see under ‘Gādhi’).
This Kuśa begot of his wife, Vaidarbhī, four sons
named Kuśāmba, Kuśanābha, Asūrtarajasa and Vasu.
Each of them built a city of his own and started his
rule there. Girivraja is the magnificent city built by
Vasu. (Sarga 32, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jarāsandha's rule.%} Vasu had a son named Bṛhaḍratha
and Jarāsandha was the son of Bṛhadratha. During the
rule of Jarāsandha Girivraja became glorious like
Nandanodyāna. This city lying in the midst of five
mountains was the seat of prosperity then. (Chapter 21,
Sabhā Parva). Jarāsandha kept many mighty kings of
his time, as prisoners in this city. Unable to control
his wrath against Kṛṣṇa once he hurled his mace a
hundred times and threw it from Girivraja to Mathurā.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Bhīmasena and Arjuna entered Girivraja in
[Page292-b+ 64]
disguise and engaging Jarāsandha in a duel killed him
and crowned his son as King. (Chapter 24, Sabhā
Parva). Once King Duṃdhumāra abandoning the gifts
offered by the devas came and slept in Girivraja.
(Śloka 39, Chapter 6, Anuśāsana Parva).
