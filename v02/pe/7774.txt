ŪRMILĀ¦. Lakṣmaṇa married Ūrmilā, the daughter of
<div n="lb"/>King Janaka and the sister of Sītā. When Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>went to the forest with Śrī Rāma and Sītā, Ūrmilā
<div n="lb"/>remained in Ayodhyā. After the forest life, Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmaṇa returned with Sītā. When Śrī Rāma
<div n="lb"/>was ruling over the country, two sons were born to
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmaṇa by Ūrmilā. The elder son was named
<div n="lb"/>Takṣaka and the second was given the name Chatra-
[Page811-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>ketu. At the instruction of Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa went
<div n="lb"/>to the Eastern sea and killed the foresters there and
<div n="lb"/>built there a city called Agatī. Takṣaka was made the
<div n="lb"/>King of Agatī. Lakṣmaṇa then went to the western sea
<div n="lb"/>and killed the Barbarians there and built a city called
<div n="lb"/>Candramatī and made Chatraketu the King of that
<div n="lb"/>city. Being punished by Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa drowned
<div n="lb"/>himself in the river Sarayū. (See under Lakṣmaṇa).
<div n="lb"/>After that Ūrmilā jumped into a pile of fire and reach-
<div n="lb"/>ed the world of Viṣṇu. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
