PĀṆḌYA¦. II. (A Tamilian dynasty of Kings.) A place of
Purāṇic fame in Dakṣiṇa Bhārata. The three states
Cera, Cola and Pāṇḍya were from early times renown-
ed states of Dakṣiṇa Bhārata. Historically and Puraṇic-
ally Pāṇḍya was a state of eminence.
<div n="NI"/>(A.) {%Historically.%} The Pāṇḍya dynasty of Kings is
very ancient, The exact period of its beginning is still
unknown. Megasthanes who lived in the fourth century
B.C. has made mention of the Pāṇḍya dynasty in his
diary. Julian, an emperor of Italy, who lived in 361
A.D. is stated to have received visitors from Pāṇḍya-
deśa. The Pāṇḍya dynasty was revived and elevated
under the leadership of Katuṅka in the 7th century A.D.
From that time till the 16th century Madura was the
capital of Pāṇḍyadeśa. The Uccāṅgī dynasty which was
ruling the places to the south of Tuṅgabhadrā during
the period from 9th century to 13th century A.D. is
believed to be a part of the Pāṇḍyavaṃśa which had
gone from Madura. A continuous history of the Pāṇḍya
line of Kings is not available. Many Kings bear names
like Jātavarmā or Māravarmā. The Pāṇḍya Kings
were devotees of Śiva even from the period of the
Jainas. At times they have ruled over the combined
kingdoms of Cera and Cola. During the period from
the 12th to the 14th century A.D. Pāṇḍya was ruled by
five of the most valiant rulers and at that time the
Pāṇḍyadeśa included all the places in south India up
to Nellore. But the power of the Pāṇḍyas waned when
the power of the Sultans who ruled Delhi spread to the
south. After 1370 A.D only on rare occasions has the
power of the Pāṇḍyas spread to the north of river
Kāverī. In 1312 A.D. Kerala got herself free from the
hold of the Tamilian Kings. (Pāṇḍyarājya).
