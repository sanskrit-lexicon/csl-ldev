CAṆḌAMAHĀSENA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A very prominent and reputed king of
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayini. Vāsavadattā, wife of Udayana was his
<div n="lb"/>daughter.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The name Caṇḍamahāsena.%} His real name was Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>sena. After ascending the throne he began doing
<div n="lb"/>tapas to get a noble wife and a good sword. When he
<div n="lb"/>cut his own flesh and made an offering of the same to
<div n="lb"/>the sacred fire after a long period of tapas the Devī
<div n="lb"/>became pleased, and offered him a sword of exceptional
<div n="lb"/>excellence and said that as long as he had that sword
<div n="lb"/>with him no enemy would defeat him. The Devī also
<div n="lb"/>assured him that ere long Aṅgāravatī, daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>asura called Aṅgāraka and the fairest damsel in the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds would become his wife. Since he (Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>sena) did the most austere rites and rituals, the Devī
<div n="lb"/>said, he would come to be called Caṇḍamahāsena.
<div n="lb"/>Afterwards the sword given by the Devī and the ele-
<div n="lb"/>phant called naḍāgiri proved as successful and effective
<div n="lb"/>to him as were Vajrāyudha and his elephant Airāvata
<div n="lb"/>to Indra.

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} One day, during a hunting expedition
<div n="lb"/>a boar escaped unhurt by the king's arrows and after
<div n="lb"/>turning turtle his chariot it went into a cave. The king
<div n="lb"/>in great anger followed the pig into the cave, and going
<div n="lb"/>forward some distance he saw a beautiful animal where-
<div n="lb"/>upon he seated himself on the side of a tank. There he
<div n="lb"/>saw, amidst a number of women an exceptionally
<div n="lb"/>beautiful woman moving about. Casting her charming
<div n="lb"/>eyes glistering with love the woman approached the
<div n="lb"/>King. During their conversation, when the king told
<div n="lb"/>her about himself she began crying. To the query as
<div n="lb"/>to the reason for her crying she answered as follows:—
<div n="lb"/>“The boar you saw is my father, Aṅgārakāsura. His
<div n="lb"/>body is harder than even diamond, and none can inflict
<div n="lb"/>any injury on it. The women you see around are
<div n="lb"/>princesses captured by my father from various palaces
<div n="lb"/>for my help, and my name is Aṅgāravatī. My father
<div n="lb"/>became a Rākṣasa as the result of a curse; he is now
<div n="lb"/>asleep in the assumed form of a boar. On awaking he
<div n="lb"/>is sure to eat you for food, and it was that thought which
<div n="lb"/>brought tears to my eyes”. To these words of Aṅgāra-
<div n="lb"/>vatī, the king replied as follows:—“If you have any
<div n="lb"/>love for me you would go to your father and begin
<div n="lb"/>crying when he wakes up, and to his question as to
<div n="lb"/>why you are crying you should reply that thoughts
<div n="lb"/>about your future in the event of your fathers's death
<div n="lb"/>brought tears in your eyes.”
<div n="NI"/>Aṅgāravatī agreed to the above proposal of the King.
<div n="lb"/>She hid the King in a safe place and went and stood
<div n="lb"/>by the side of her father. Everything happened as was
<div n="lb"/>anticipated and Aṅgāraka consoled his daughter by
<div n="lb"/>saying that none would be able to kill him whose
<div n="lb"/>body was as hard and strong as diamond, there being
<div n="lb"/>only one opening through which he might be struck on
<div n="lb"/>the left wrist which might be concealed by the bow.
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍamahāsena who heard the above talk came out of
<div n="lb"/>his hiding place and challenged the asura to war. He
<div n="lb"/>raised his left hand to show the sign, “just coming,
<div n="lb"/>please wait”, and the king then shot his arrow through
<div n="lb"/>the opening on his left wrist. The asura fell dead.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Vāsavadattā:%} And, now Caṇḍamahāsena
<div n="lb"/>married Aṅgāravatī and returned to his kingdom with
<div n="lb"/>his wife. Two sons, Gopālaka and Pālaka were born to
<div n="lb"/>the royal couple, and the King celebrated an Indro-
<div n="lb"/>tsava for the welfare and prosperity of the children.
<div n="lb"/>Pleased at the utsava Indra appeared to the king in
<div n="lb"/>sleep and blessed him saying that a daughter would be
<div n="lb"/>born to him and that her son would be crowned empe-
<div n="lb"/>ror of the Vidyādharas. Accordingly a daughter was
<div n="lb"/>born to the King, and she was called Vāsavadattā.
<div n="lb"/>(given by Vāsava, i.e. Indra). Udayana married Vāsava-
<div n="lb"/>dattā. (See Udayana).
