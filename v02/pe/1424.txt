CAṆḌAMAHĀSENA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A very prominent and reputed king of
Ujjayini. Vāsavadattā, wife of Udayana was his
daughter.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The name Caṇḍamahāsena.%} His real name was Mahā-
sena. After ascending the throne he began doing
tapas to get a noble wife and a good sword. When he
cut his own flesh and made an offering of the same to
the sacred fire after a long period of tapas the Devī
became pleased, and offered him a sword of exceptional
excellence and said that as long as he had that sword
with him no enemy would defeat him. The Devī also
assured him that ere long Aṅgāravatī, daughter of the
asura called Aṅgāraka and the fairest damsel in the
three worlds would become his wife. Since he (Mahā-
sena) did the most austere rites and rituals, the Devī
said, he would come to be called Caṇḍamahāsena.
Afterwards the sword given by the Devī and the ele-
phant called naḍāgiri proved as successful and effective
to him as were Vajrāyudha and his elephant Airāvata
to Indra.

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} One day, during a hunting expedition
a boar escaped unhurt by the king's arrows and after
turning turtle his chariot it went into a cave. The king
in great anger followed the pig into the cave, and going
forward some distance he saw a beautiful animal where-
upon he seated himself on the side of a tank. There he
saw, amidst a number of women an exceptionally
beautiful woman moving about. Casting her charming
eyes glistering with love the woman approached the
King. During their conversation, when the king told
her about himself she began crying. To the query as
to the reason for her crying she answered as follows:—
“The boar you saw is my father, Aṅgārakāsura. His
body is harder than even diamond, and none can inflict
any injury on it. The women you see around are
princesses captured by my father from various palaces
for my help, and my name is Aṅgāravatī. My father
became a Rākṣasa as the result of a curse; he is now
asleep in the assumed form of a boar. On awaking he
is sure to eat you for food, and it was that thought which
brought tears to my eyes”. To these words of Aṅgāra-
vatī, the king replied as follows:—“If you have any
love for me you would go to your father and begin
crying when he wakes up, and to his question as to
why you are crying you should reply that thoughts
about your future in the event of your fathers's death
brought tears in your eyes.”
<div n="NI"/>Aṅgāravatī agreed to the above proposal of the King.
She hid the King in a safe place and went and stood
by the side of her father. Everything happened as was
anticipated and Aṅgāraka consoled his daughter by
saying that none would be able to kill him whose
body was as hard and strong as diamond, there being
only one opening through which he might be struck on
the left wrist which might be concealed by the bow.
Caṇḍamahāsena who heard the above talk came out of
his hiding place and challenged the asura to war. He
raised his left hand to show the sign, “just coming,
please wait”, and the king then shot his arrow through
the opening on his left wrist. The asura fell dead.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Birth of Vāsavadattā:%} And, now Caṇḍamahāsena
married Aṅgāravatī and returned to his kingdom with
his wife. Two sons, Gopālaka and Pālaka were born to
the royal couple, and the King celebrated an Indro-
tsava for the welfare and prosperity of the children.
Pleased at the utsava Indra appeared to the king in
sleep and blessed him saying that a daughter would be
born to him and that her son would be crowned empe-
ror of the Vidyādharas. Accordingly a daughter was
born to the King, and she was called Vāsavadattā.
(given by Vāsava, i.e. Indra). Udayana married Vāsava-
dattā. (See Udayana).
