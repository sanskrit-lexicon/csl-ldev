ARVĀVASU¦. An ancient Ascetic who had been a lumi-
<div n="lb"/>nary in the Durbar hall of King Yudhiṣṭhira. There
<div n="lb"/>is a story in the Mahābhārata showing the merits of
<div n="lb"/>penance of Arvāvasu. This story was told by the her-
<div n="lb"/>mit Lomaśa to the Pāṇḍavas, when they arrived at the
<div n="lb"/>holy bath Madhugilasamaṅga, during their exile in
<div n="lb"/>the forest. “Long ago two ascetics Raibhya and Bhara-
<div n="lb"/>dvāja had built their hermitages and lived here. A son
<div n="lb"/>named Yavakrīta was born to Bharadvāja. To Raibh-
<div n="lb"/>ya, two sons called Arvāvasu and Parāvasu were born.
<div n="lb"/>Raibhya and his sons were learned men. Bharadvāja and
<div n="lb"/>Yavakrīta became ascetics. Yavakrīta started doing
<div n="lb"/>penance with a view to get the boon of learning com-
<div n="lb"/>ing to him automatically without getting it directly
<div n="lb"/>from Brahmins. When his penance became severe Indra
<div n="lb"/>appeared and told him that the boon he asked for was
<div n="lb"/>an impossibility and tried to dissuade him from his
<div n="lb"/>attempt. Yavakrīta was not willing to give up penance.
<div n="lb"/>Later Indra came in the guise of a Brahmin to the
[Page057-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Banks of the Ganges and began to build a dam with
<div n="lb"/>sand particles. Yavakrīta said that it was an impossible
<div n="lb"/>task. Indra said that the desire of Yavakrīta also was
<div n="lb"/>as impossible as that. Still Yavakrīta did not show any
<div n="lb"/>intention of drawing back. Finally Indra granted him
<div n="lb"/>the boon.
<div n="NI"/>Yavakrīta returned to the hermitage. Full of arrogance
<div n="lb"/>he hankered after the daughter-in-law of Raibhya.
<div n="lb"/>Raibhya plucked a tuft of hair from his head and put
<div n="lb"/>it as oblation in fire and created a giant who killed
<div n="lb"/>Yavakrīta. Bharadvāja felt sad and cursed Raibhya
<div n="lb"/>that he would be killed by his son. Then with Yava-
<div n="lb"/>krīta he jumped into the fire and died.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Bṛhaddyumna, a Brahmin performed a
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. He invited Arvāvasu and Parāvasu as helpers.
<div n="lb"/>As Parāvasu was going along the forest he saw his father
<div n="lb"/>covered with the hide of a deer and shot at him think-
<div n="lb"/>ing him to be a deer. He stealthily informed the matter
<div n="lb"/>to Arvāvasu. Arvāvasu went to the forest completed the
<div n="lb"/>funeral rites of his father and returned. Parāvasu spread
<div n="lb"/>the rumour everywhere that Arvāvasu had murdered
<div n="lb"/>his father. In the innocence of Arvāvasu, nobody
<div n="lb"/>believed. Everyone avoided him. He became sad and
<div n="lb"/>forlorn and went to the forest and did penance to the
<div n="lb"/>Sun. The Sun appeared before him and blessed him.
<div n="lb"/>He returned and brought Yavakrīta, Bharadvāja and
<div n="lb"/>Raibhya to life again.
<div n="NI"/>All these occurrences happened in this bath called
<div n="lb"/>Madhubilasaṃgama. (Mahābhārata, Araṇya Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapters 135, 136, 137, 138).
<div n="NI"/>The report of a conversation between this hermit, and
<div n="lb"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa who had been on his way to Hastināpura,
<div n="lb"/>is given in the Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 336,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 7. Arvāvasu also is counted among the hermits
<div n="lb"/>who possessed the Brightness of Brahmā like Rudra.
<div n="NI"/>“Hermit Vasiṣṭha! Now I shall give their names in
<div n="lb"/>order. Yavakrīta, Raibhya, Arvāvasu, Parāvasu, Kak-
<div n="lb"/>ṣīvān, Aurṣija, Bala, Aṅgiras, Ṛṣimedha, Tithisuta,
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva, these are the Bright hermits, having the bright-
<div n="lb"/>ness of Brahmā, lauded by the world and as bright as
<div n="lb"/>Rudra, Fire and Vasu”. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 150, Stanzas 30, 31 & 32).
<div n="NI"/>Arvāvasu did penance to the Sun for getting children.
<div n="lb"/>The Sun-God came down from his way in the sky and
<div n="lb"/>gave him through Aruṇa directions mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Kalpa (one of the six Śāstras or Sciences) regarding
<div n="lb"/>Saptamī rituals. Arvāvasu observed them strictly and
<div n="lb"/>as a result he got children and wealth. This story is
<div n="lb"/>given in Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brahma Parva).
