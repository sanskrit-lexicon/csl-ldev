JARĀ¦. A harpy (Rākṣasī). Though she was a harpy
<div n="lb"/>she loved human beings. It is believed that if the
<div n="lb"/>picture of Jarā and her children is placed in the
<div n="lb"/>house and venerated, there will be no haunting of any
<div n="lb"/>other kinds of demons.
<div n="NI"/>The figure of Jarā was sculptured on the wall of the
<div n="lb"/>Palace of Bṛhadratha, the King of Magadha, and was
<div n="lb"/>being worshipped. Because the King worshipped her,
<div n="lb"/>she had been looking forward to an opportunity to
<div n="lb"/>reward the King. Bṛhadratha had married two
<div n="lb"/>daughters of the King of Kāśī. They were twin sisters.
<div n="lb"/>For a long time they remained childless. The King
<div n="lb"/>was very sorry, and went to the forest with his wives.
<div n="lb"/>He saw the hermit Kakṣīvān or Caṇḍakauśika, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Gautama and requested that a son should be born
<div n="lb"/>to him. The hermit was sitting in meditation under a
<div n="lb"/>mango tree and a mango fell on his lap. The hermit
<div n="lb"/>took it and by prayer and meditation he invoked
<div n="lb"/>divine power into it and gave it to the King. The King
<div n="lb"/>divided it into two and gave it to his wives. The queens
<div n="lb"/>became pregnant and the three returned joyously.
<div n="NI"/>In due course both delivered. But each of them gave
<div n="lb"/>birth to only half of a child. The horrified queens took
<div n="lb"/>the uncouth figures outside the palace and left them
<div n="lb"/>there. Jarā was watching this. She ran to the spot
<div n="lb"/>and placed the two portions together. Instantly it
<div n="lb"/>became a child of proper form. Hearing the cry of the
<div n="lb"/>child the mothers came out. Jarā appeared there and
<div n="lb"/>placed the child before the King Bṛhadratha. As desired
<div n="lb"/>by Jarā the child was named Jarāsandha because he
<div n="lb"/>was joined together by Jarā. This child grew up and
<div n="lb"/>became the notorious King Jarāsandha of Magadha.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Sabhā Parva, 3 Chapters from 17).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Droṇa Parva, Chapter
<div n="lb"/>182, Stanza 12 that when Arjuna fought with Jarā-
<div n="lb"/>sandha this harpy had been staying in the weapon of
<div n="lb"/>Jarāsandha and was killed in that fight.
