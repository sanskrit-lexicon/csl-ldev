UTSAVA¦. Celebrations conducted in temples from
olden days. There are Śāstraic (scriptural) injunctions
as regards conducting utsavas. Utsava is an indispens-
able celebration when once the deity (idol) is in-
stalled in the temple. Utsava should be celebrated for
one day, three days or seven days in the very same
month in which the deity was installed, because non-
celebration of Utsava will render the installation in-
effective. Utsava should be conducted either during
Uttarāyaṇa (movement of the sun from south to North)
or Viṣu (when the Sun is in the centre) or at a time
suitable to the temple authorities who conduct the
utsava in Śayana, Upavana or Gṛha. It should com-
mence with auspicious ceremonies like the sowing of
seeds of nine varieties of foodgrains, and with dance,
song, instrumental music etc.
