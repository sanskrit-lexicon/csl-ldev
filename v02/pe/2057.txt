DILĪPA I¦. (Khaṭvāṅga). A mighty king of the Ikṣvāku
<div n="lb"/>dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See Daśaratha's Genealogy.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Reign and Birth of Son.%} Dilīpa is counted as one of the
<div n="lb"/>noblest kings. His reign was extremely popular. But
<div n="lb"/>even after a long period of married life, he had no
<div n="lb"/>issue. His queen was Sudakṣiṇā, the princess of Maga-
<div n="lb"/>dha. In order to get Vasiṣṭha's advice, Dilīpa and
<div n="lb"/>Sudakṣiṇā went to the sage's āśrama. After hearing
<div n="lb"/>about their grievance, Vasiṣṭha meditated for a little
<div n="lb"/>while and described why the royal couple were not
<div n="lb"/>blessed with children:—“Long ago, Dilīpa had paid
<div n="lb"/>a visit to Indra. While returning after the visit, he
<div n="lb"/>passed by Kāmadhenu who was lying under the shade of
<div n="lb"/>Kalpavṛkṣa. He paid no heed to her, as he did not
<div n="lb"/>see her. The divine cow (Kāmadhenu) took this as
<div n="lb"/>a personal slight to her and cursed the King that he
<div n="lb"/>would not have children until he served and propitiat-
<div n="lb"/>ed her daughter, Nandinī. Neither the King nor his
<div n="lb"/>charioteer was aware of the curse. Kāmadhenu has
<div n="lb"/>now gone to Pātāla (underworld) to attend a sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>of Varuṇa. Therefore Dilīpa and his queen should
<div n="lb"/>attend on and propitiate her daughter, Nandinī.”
<div n="NI"/>From the next morning the King and queen began to
<div n="lb"/>offer their services to Nandinī. The King followed her
<div n="lb"/>as her shadow. After twentyone days, one morning
<div n="lb"/>Nandinī went to graze in a dense forest. As usual, the
<div n="lb"/>King also followed her. As they reached the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the woods, the King was enchanted for a moment
<div n="lb"/>by the charm of the Sylvan scenery. Just then, on
<div n="lb"/>turning round he saw a lion springing towards Nandinī
<div n="lb"/>to prey upon her. Suddenly he took up his bow and
<div n="lb"/>aimed an arrow at the lion, but to his great amaze-
<div n="lb"/>ment, his hands were paralysed. The lion spoke to him
<div n="lb"/>as follows:—“O King, you need not exert yourself in
<div n="lb"/>vain. I am the servant of Lord Śiva. This holy deodar
[Page242-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>tree which you see in front of us, was planted and
<div n="lb"/>tended by Pārvatī. My task is to protect this tree.
<div n="lb"/>Pārvatī and lord Śiva have authorized me to kill and
<div n="lb"/>eat the animals which come this way. Therefore this
<div n="lb"/>cow is my food.”
<div n="NI"/>The king was in a fix. He begged the lion to spare
<div n="lb"/>Nandinī and to eat his (king's) body instead. The
<div n="lb"/>lion agreed. The King put down his arms and stood
<div n="lb"/>bowing down in front of the lion. Hearing the words,
<div n="lb"/>“Beloved child, arise” he looked up, and the lion had
<div n="lb"/>vanished. Just then Nandinī told him that it was she
<div n="lb"/>herself who had done this to test him. The King and
<div n="lb"/>Nandinī then returned to the Āśrama. As a result of
<div n="lb"/>Nandinī's blessing, the King's wife bore a son who
<div n="lb"/>later became the celebrated emperor Raghu. (Padma
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 198).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Killing of the Asura, Vīrasena.%} Once a powerful Asura
<div n="lb"/>named Vīrasena attacked Vaiśravaṇa. When lord
<div n="lb"/>Śiva came to know of it he tried to defeat Vīrasena,
<div n="lb"/>but in vain. At Śiva's request, Mahāviṣṇu entered the
<div n="lb"/>scene. He was also unable to subdue the Asura.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu advised Vaiśravaṇa to seek the help of Dilīpa.
<div n="lb"/>Dilīpa went to Alakāpurī and encountered Vīrasena.
<div n="lb"/>Under the shower of arrows from Dilīpa, blood began
<div n="lb"/>to flow from the body of Vīrasena. But each drop of
<div n="lb"/>his blood came to life as a new Vīrasena and all those
<div n="lb"/>Vīrasenas continued a ceaseless battle with Dilīpa.
<div n="lb"/>At last Dilīpa prayed to Rakteśvarī who suddenly
<div n="lb"/>appeared and drank all the blood. In this way the king
<div n="lb"/>managed to kill Vīrasena. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Dilīpa and the Holy Waters.%} Once king Dilīpa led
<div n="lb"/>a saintly life on the bank of Gaṅgā, the sacred place
<div n="lb"/>worshipped by Devas, Ṛṣis and Gandharvas. With
<div n="lb"/>religious practices and offering pūjā to Devas, Ṛṣis
<div n="lb"/>and Pitṛs, he spent time in prayer and meditation.
<div n="lb"/>One day he happened to meet Vasiṣṭha, and paid
<div n="lb"/>homage to him. The sage Vasiṣṭha described to him
<div n="lb"/>all the places of sacred waters and explained the great-
<div n="lb"/>ness of each. (See under Khaṭvāṅga). (Padma Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 10).
