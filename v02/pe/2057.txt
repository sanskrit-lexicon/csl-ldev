DILĪPA I¦. (Khaṭvāṅga). A mighty king of the Ikṣvāku
dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See Daśaratha's Genealogy.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Reign and Birth of Son.%} Dilīpa is counted as one of the
noblest kings. His reign was extremely popular. But
even after a long period of married life, he had no
issue. His queen was Sudakṣiṇā, the princess of Maga-
dha. In order to get Vasiṣṭha's advice, Dilīpa and
Sudakṣiṇā went to the sage's āśrama. After hearing
about their grievance, Vasiṣṭha meditated for a little
while and described why the royal couple were not
blessed with children:—“Long ago, Dilīpa had paid
a visit to Indra. While returning after the visit, he
passed by Kāmadhenu who was lying under the shade of
Kalpavṛkṣa. He paid no heed to her, as he did not
see her. The divine cow (Kāmadhenu) took this as
a personal slight to her and cursed the King that he
would not have children until he served and propitiat-
ed her daughter, Nandinī. Neither the King nor his
charioteer was aware of the curse. Kāmadhenu has
now gone to Pātāla (underworld) to attend a sacrifice
of Varuṇa. Therefore Dilīpa and his queen should
attend on and propitiate her daughter, Nandinī.”
<div n="NI"/>From the next morning the King and queen began to
offer their services to Nandinī. The King followed her
as her shadow. After twentyone days, one morning
Nandinī went to graze in a dense forest. As usual, the
King also followed her. As they reached the middle
of the woods, the King was enchanted for a moment
by the charm of the Sylvan scenery. Just then, on
turning round he saw a lion springing towards Nandinī
to prey upon her. Suddenly he took up his bow and
aimed an arrow at the lion, but to his great amaze-
ment, his hands were paralysed. The lion spoke to him
as follows:—“O King, you need not exert yourself in
vain. I am the servant of Lord Śiva. This holy deodar
[Page242-a+ 64]
tree which you see in front of us, was planted and
tended by Pārvatī. My task is to protect this tree.
Pārvatī and lord Śiva have authorized me to kill and
eat the animals which come this way. Therefore this
cow is my food.”
<div n="NI"/>The king was in a fix. He begged the lion to spare
Nandinī and to eat his (king's) body instead. The
lion agreed. The King put down his arms and stood
bowing down in front of the lion. Hearing the words,
“Beloved child, arise” he looked up, and the lion had
vanished. Just then Nandinī told him that it was she
herself who had done this to test him. The King and
Nandinī then returned to the Āśrama. As a result of
Nandinī's blessing, the King's wife bore a son who
later became the celebrated emperor Raghu. (Padma
Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 198).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Killing of the Asura, Vīrasena.%} Once a powerful Asura
named Vīrasena attacked Vaiśravaṇa. When lord
Śiva came to know of it he tried to defeat Vīrasena,
but in vain. At Śiva's request, Mahāviṣṇu entered the
scene. He was also unable to subdue the Asura.
Viṣṇu advised Vaiśravaṇa to seek the help of Dilīpa.
Dilīpa went to Alakāpurī and encountered Vīrasena.
Under the shower of arrows from Dilīpa, blood began
to flow from the body of Vīrasena. But each drop of
his blood came to life as a new Vīrasena and all those
Vīrasenas continued a ceaseless battle with Dilīpa.
At last Dilīpa prayed to Rakteśvarī who suddenly
appeared and drank all the blood. In this way the king
managed to kill Vīrasena. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Dilīpa and the Holy Waters.%} Once king Dilīpa led
a saintly life on the bank of Gaṅgā, the sacred place
worshipped by Devas, Ṛṣis and Gandharvas. With
religious practices and offering pūjā to Devas, Ṛṣis
and Pitṛs, he spent time in prayer and meditation.
One day he happened to meet Vasiṣṭha, and paid
homage to him. The sage Vasiṣṭha described to him
all the places of sacred waters and explained the great-
ness of each. (See under Khaṭvāṅga). (Padma Purāṇa,
Chapter 10).
