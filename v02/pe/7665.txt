UDDAṆḌAŚĀSTRĪ¦. One of the eighteen and a half
<div n="lb"/>famous poets of Kerala. He was a Sanskrit poet. His
<div n="lb"/>native place was Lāṭapura on the bank of river Pālār
<div n="lb"/>in Toṇḍamaṇḍala in the Tamilnad. The name of his
<div n="lb"/>father was Śrī Kṛṣṇa and that of his mother was Raṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>devī. Poet Ulloor says that Śāstrī had another name
<div n="lb"/>Irugupanātha. He had a very good education. After
<div n="lb"/>having completed his education, he travelled through
<div n="lb"/>Āndhra, Karṇāṭaka, Kaliṅga, Cola, Kerala and many
<div n="lb"/>other countries and finally came to Kozhikode and
<div n="lb"/>visited the King Mānavikramamahārāja. At the instance
<div n="lb"/>of the king he composed the drama called Mallikāmā-
<div n="lb"/>rutam. Besides this we have obtained only the ‘Kokila-
<div n="lb"/>sandeśa’ and some other single poems of Śāstrī. It is said
<div n="lb"/>that there is a thesis on dramas also. Śāstrī was not
<div n="lb"/>in the habit of respecting those who did not pay respect
<div n="lb"/>to him, however superior they might be. So some say
<div n="lb"/>that he was arrogant. A Malayāla Brahmin called
<div n="lb"/>Bhaṭṭatiri of Kākkaśśeri, rose against Śāstrī in Kerala.
