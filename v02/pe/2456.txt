GOHATYĀ¦. In ancient India killing of cows was con-
sidered to be a great sin. It is interesting to note the
punishment prescribed for this crime in the Agni
Purāṇa. For one month he should drink barley water
only. He should live in a cow-shed wearing the hide of
the cow he has killed. He can have some supper and
that too without salt He must bathe for two months in
cow's urine. During day time he should follow the cows
looking after their comfort. He should drink the
menstrual discharge with his face lifted upwards.
Fasting, he should give away as charity ten cows and a
bull. If not, he should give as charity all his wealth to
god-fearing brahmins. If a man only stops the cow for
others to kill he should bear a fourth of the punishment;
if he stops and ties it for killing he should bear half of
the punishment and if he stops it, ties it and gives the
weapon for killing he should bear three-fourths of the
punishment. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 159),
