JAYANTA I¦. Son of Indra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
<div n="lb"/>order: Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Indra—Jayanta.
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta was the son born to Indra by his wife Śacī-
<div n="lb"/>devī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 112, Stanzas 3 and 4).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jayanta lost one eye.%} During his forest life, Śrī Rāma
[Page354-b+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>lived with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa on the mountain Citra-
<div n="lb"/>kūṭa for some days. Once Śrī Rāma, being very tired
<div n="lb"/>of walking in the forest fell asleep with his head in the
<div n="lb"/>lap of Sītā. Taking this chance Jayanta came in the
<div n="lb"/>shape of a crow and scratched the breast of Sītā with
<div n="lb"/>his claws. Sītā cried and Śrī Rāma woke up and saw
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta in the shape of a crow. Rāma got angry and
<div n="lb"/>shot the Brahmāstra (a divine arrow) against Jayanta.
<div n="lb"/>Fear of life made him fly throughout the whole of the
<div n="lb"/>three worlds. Even Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara
<div n="lb"/>were unable to protect him, All the while the divine
<div n="lb"/>arrow followed him. Finally having no go he came and
<div n="lb"/>fell at the feet of Śrī Rāma. Śrī Rāma said that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmāstra could never become futile and so the arrow
<div n="lb"/>must hit his right eye. Accordingly the arrow struck at
<div n="lb"/>his right eye and thus Jayanta lost his right eye. In
<div n="lb"/>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa this story is stated with some
<div n="lb"/>slight changes. According to Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>this incident took place when Sītā had been drying raw
<div n="lb"/>flesh. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 38).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jayanta hidden in the ocean.%} After getting the boons
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa became arrogant and with a big army went to
<div n="lb"/>the realm of the gods. Rāvaṇa engaged Indra in a
<div n="lb"/>fierce battle. In that fight Meghanāda the son of
<div n="lb"/>Rāvaṇa attacked Jayanta, who swooned and fell down.
<div n="lb"/>Immediately Pulomā, the father of Śacīdevī, gathered
<div n="lb"/>Jayanta in his hands unseen by anybody and hid him
<div n="lb"/>in the sea. After the disappearance of Jayanta the battle
<div n="lb"/>entered the second stage. Thinking that his son Jayanta
<div n="lb"/>had been killed, Indra began to fight with Rāvaṇa
<div n="lb"/>with more vigour than before. In the battle which
<div n="lb"/>followed Meghanāda subdued Indra and made him a
<div n="lb"/>captive. Taking Indra and the celestial maids as
<div n="lb"/>captives, Rāvaṇa and his men went to Laṅkā. (Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Jayanta became Bamboo.%} Once Agastya came to
<div n="lb"/>Indra's durbar. Indra arranged for the dance of
<div n="lb"/>Urvaśī in honour of Agastya's visit. In the midst of
<div n="lb"/>the dance Urvaśī saw Jayanta before her and she fell
<div n="lb"/>in love with him. Consequently her steps went out of
<div n="lb"/>beat. Nārada who was playing his lute called Mahatī
<div n="lb"/>went wrong. Agastya got angry and cursed Jayanta
<div n="lb"/>and changed him to a bamboo. Urvaśī was cursed to
<div n="lb"/>become a woman with the name Mādhavī. Agastya
<div n="lb"/>cursed Nārada that his lute Mahatī would become the
<div n="lb"/>lute of the people of the world. (Vāyu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) In the stealing of the Pārijātapuṣpa (the flower of
<div n="lb"/>a paradise tree) Jayanta fought with Pradyumna the
<div n="lb"/>son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and was defeated. (Viṣṇu Parva
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 73).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Jayanta was defeated by Śūrapadma, an Asura,
<div n="lb"/>in a battle. (Skanda Purāṇa, Asura Kāṇḍa).
