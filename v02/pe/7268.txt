SŪRYAKETU¦. A daitya (demon). Once this daitya
<div n="lb"/>conquered the world of the gods and expelled Indra.
<div n="lb"/>At that time Purañjaya was the King of Ayodhyā, who
<div n="lb"/>was born in the Solar dynasty. Indra requested for his
<div n="lb"/>help. Purañjaya agreed to help Indra, on condition that
<div n="lb"/>Indra should stand as an ox and that he would sit on
<div n="lb"/>the hump of that ox and fight. Accordingly he sat on
<div n="lb"/>the ‘Kakud’ (hump) of the ox and fought in the battle,
<div n="lb"/>killed Sūryaketu, and reinstated Indra in his former
<div n="lb"/>position. Because he sat on the ‘Kakud’, Purañjaya got
<div n="lb"/>the name Kakutstha. The dynasty of the King came to
<div n="lb"/>be called by the name Kākutstha. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Yuddhakāṇḍa).
