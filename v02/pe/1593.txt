CITRARATHA VIII¦. Son of Vīrabāhu and a friend of
Śrī Rāma. In the Rājya Kāṇḍa of Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa
there is the following story about him.
<div n="NI"/>Citraratha was also one among those assembled for the
svayaṃvara of Hemā, daughter of Kuśa. He sent an
anaesthetic missile to the assemblage and made them
all fall down senseless. He then took Hemā out from the
marriage hall. But on reaching outside he felt he had
done a very unjust thing and so withdrew the missile
and stood outside ready to fight. A fight ensued in
which Citraratha defeated all. But Lava alone continued
to fight with him. Vīrabāhu, father of Citraratha, who
was closely watching the fight came to the help of Citra-
ratha and engaging Lava in a fight struck him down.
Kuśa seeing this attacked Vīrabāhu and bound him
hand and foot. At that time Śrī Rāma came to the scene
and told Kuśa that Vīrabāhu was a friend of his and
set Vīrabāhu free. Hemā was then married to Citra-
ratha and Vīrabāhu was sent away with due respect.
