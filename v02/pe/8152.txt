VĀYU I¦. One of the eight guardians of the world.
<div n="lb"/>(Dikpālakas).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Vāyu was born from the breath
<div n="lb"/>of Viśvapuruṣa. (Ṛgveda 10, 90). Tvaṣṭā was the son
<div n="lb"/>in-law of Vāyu. The eight dikpālakas are Indra, Vahni
<div n="lb"/>(Fire), Yama, Nirṛti, Varuṇa, Vāyu, Kubera and Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu is the guardian of the North West zone. The
<div n="lb"/>palace of Bhagavān Vāyu is known as Gandhavatī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Confrontation with Vāsuki.%} Once Vāyu and Vāsuki
<div n="lb"/>tried to find out who of the two was mightier, in con-
<div n="lb"/>sequence of which, Trikūṭaparvata, a peak of Mount
[Page841-a+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Himālaya, was broken from its bed and thrown into
<div n="lb"/>the southern ocean near Laṅkā. Later, the city of
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā was built on this mountain. (For details see
<div n="lb"/>under Trikūṭa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Children.%} Bhīmasena and Hanūmān are said to be
<div n="lb"/>the prominent sons of Bhagavān Vāyu. It is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 7, Sūkta 112, that
<div n="lb"/>Agni was the son of Vāyu. To make fire from wood by
<div n="lb"/>attrition, the hands obtain strength by the help of the
<div n="lb"/>life breath called Vyāna (a breath or vāyu). It is from
<div n="lb"/>this, that the idea that fire is the son of Vāyu, came in-
<div n="lb"/>to existence. To know how Vāyu obtained the paternity
<div n="lb"/>of Bhīma and Hanūmān see under Bhīma and Hanūmān.
<div n="lb"/>It is stated in Brahma Purāṇa that a group of celestial
<div n="lb"/>maids called ‘Mudā’ owes its origin to Vāyu.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Love of Vāyu.%} Once Bhagavān Vāyu happened to see
<div n="lb"/>the six beautiful daughters of Kuśanābha, a king, and
<div n="lb"/>he was excited sexually. As the princesses refused to
<div n="lb"/>satisfy his desire, Vāyu changed the damsels into hunch-
<div n="lb"/>backs, by a curse. (For detailed story see under Kuśa-
<div n="lb"/>nābha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The Vāyus (breaths) in the body.%} (See under Nāḍīcakra).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Curbing the arrogance of Silk-cotton tree.%} Long ago a
<div n="lb"/>silk-cotton tree grew up on the top of the Himālayas.
<div n="lb"/>It grew up to be a big tree spreading its branches in
<div n="lb"/>all directions. Birds built their nests on the branches of
<div n="lb"/>that big tree and hermits and animals found shelter
<div n="lb"/>under its shade. The silk-cotton tree became arrogant.
<div n="lb"/>Once Nārada came there and praised the tree:—“How
<div n="lb"/>gigantic, this silk-cotton tree is! Even in a great storm
<div n="lb"/>its branches do not move.” The praise of Nārada made
<div n="lb"/>the tree more haughty. It told Nārada that the storm
<div n="lb"/>etc. were its servants. Nārada told Vāyu, what the
<div n="lb"/>silk-cotton tree said to him. Vāyu got angry and com-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the tree, said thus:- “You, wicked silk-cotton
<div n="lb"/>tree, in days of yore, when Brahmā was carrying on
<div n="lb"/>creation he took rest on you for a while. That is why I
<div n="lb"/>keep motionless when I come to you. It is not because
<div n="lb"/>I am afraid of you. I knew that you belittled me before
<div n="lb"/>Nārada. If you are bold enough, come and fight with
<div n="lb"/>me.”
<div n="NI"/>The silk-cotton tree accepted the challenge. Next day
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān Vāyu changed into a storm and blew against
<div n="lb"/>the tree. The tree lost leaves, flowers and fruits and
<div n="lb"/>stood bare. Thus within a very short time the arrogance
<div n="lb"/>of the tree was curbed.
<div n="NI"/>This story was told to Yudhiṣṭhira by Bhīṣma, to show
<div n="lb"/>that rendering help to a foe, will only make him
<div n="lb"/>haughty. (M.B. Śānti Parva, 3 Chapters from 154).
<div n="NI"/>{%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) When Indra cut off the wings of the mountains,
<div n="lb"/>Bhagavān Vāyu saved the mountain Maināka from this
<div n="lb"/>danger, by hiding it in the ocean. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Sundara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 1, Stanza 126).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The image of Bhagavān Vāyu should be consecrated
<div n="lb"/>as sitting on the haunch of a deer, holding a flag. (Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa, Chapter 51).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Indra sent Vāyu also along with Menakā to hinder
<div n="lb"/>the penance of Viśvāmitra. While Menakā was dancing
<div n="lb"/>in front of Viśvāmitra, Vāyu displaced her cloth. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapter 72, Stanza 1).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 19, Stanza 22, that Vāyu is the messenger of
<div n="lb"/>the gods.
[Page841-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(v) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 11, Stanza 20, that Vāyu stays in the palace
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā, praising him.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Once Pradyumna tried to kill Śālva. At that time
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu went to Pradyumna as the messenger of Gods.
<div n="lb"/>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 19, Stanza 22).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Vāyu proved that Damayantī was chaste. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Vana Parva, Chapter 76, Stanza 36).
<div n="NI"/>(viii) Vāyu declared that Sītā was chaste. (M.B. Vana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 291, Stanza 27).
<div n="NI"/>(ix) In Tripuradahana (the burning of Tripura) Vāyu
<div n="lb"/>acted as the arrow of the bow of Śiva. (M.B. Droṇa
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 202, Stanza 76).
<div n="NI"/>(x) Vāyu gave Subrahmaṇya two attendants called
<div n="lb"/>Bala and Atibala. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 45,
<div n="lb"/>Stanza 44).
<div n="NI"/>(xi) Once Vāyu advised Purūravas about the need of
<div n="lb"/>a priest. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 72, Stanzas 10-25).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) Once Bhagavān Vāyu talked elaborately on the
<div n="lb"/>secrets of goodness and badness. (M.B. Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 128).
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) Bhagavān Vāyu once talked about the greatness
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmins to Kārtavīryārjuna. (M.B. Anuśāsana
<div n="lb"/>Parva, Chapter 152).
