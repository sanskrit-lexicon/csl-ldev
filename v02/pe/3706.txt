KṚTTIKĀ I¦. When Subrahmaṇya was born the Devas
deputed six mothers to breast-feed him, and they are
called Kṛttikās. Certain Purāṇas hold the view that
six faces were caused to Subrahmaṇya as he had to
feed on six breasts at the same time while others opine
that six mothers were deputed to feed him as he was
born with six faces. Again, according to certain
Purāṇas it was Pārvatī, who deputed the Kṛttikās. The
child came to be known as Kārttikeya also as it was fed
by the Kṛttikās. (Skanda Purāṇa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 37 and Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇaka-
lambaka, Taraṅga 6).
<div n="NI"/>After having fed Skanda the Kṛttikās entered into the
sphere of the stars. (Vana Parva, Chapter 236, Verse
11). The star into which the Kṛttikās entered is
called the Kṛttikā star. Nārada said once that if one
feeds brahmins with ghee and pudding on Kārttika day
one may ascend to Devaloka. (Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 64, Verse 5).
