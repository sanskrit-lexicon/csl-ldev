SUBĀHU VII¦. A Rākṣasa. One of the two sons of
Tāṭakā, the other being Mārīca. A Gandharva named
Sunda was their father. Subāhu and Mārīca possessed,
like Tāṭakā, great power and adeptness in magic.
Agastya once cursed Tāṭakā and her two sons who went
to fight him for his having cursed Sunda to ashes when
he attacked his āśrama. Subāhu was killed in a battle
with Śrī Rāma during his stay in exile in the forest.
