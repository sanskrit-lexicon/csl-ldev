SURASĀ I¦. Mother of nāgas (serpents).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Ten daughters were born to Kaśyapaprajā-
<div n="lb"/>pati by his wife Krodhavaśā, daughter of Dakṣa includ-
<div n="lb"/>ing Surasā. From Surasā were born all the nāgas.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 14).
<div n="NI"/>Nāgas and Uragas are two sects of serpents. From Surasā
<div n="lb"/>were born Nāgas and from Kadrū, Uragas. (Vālmiki
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Canto 14, Verse 28).
<div n="NI"/>Surasā was born from the wrath of Krodhavaśā and the
<div n="lb"/>former had three daughters called Analā, Ruhā and
<div n="lb"/>Vīrudhā. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 61).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Obstructed the passage of Hanūmān.%} To test whether
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān, who jumped into Laṅkā to seek out Sītā,
<div n="lb"/>possessed power enough for the purpose, Devagandharvas
<div n="lb"/>beckoned Surasā to them and told her as follows: “You
<div n="lb"/>mother of nāgas, do please assume a terrible form like a
<div n="lb"/>big mountain and appear before Hanūmān and obstruct
<div n="lb"/>his passage. As soon as she heard the injunction, she
<div n="lb"/>jumped before Hanūmān and attempted to devour him.
<div n="lb"/>In spite of Hanūmān's earnest pleadings she stood
<div n="lb"/>before him with her mouth opened wide. Hanūmān
<div n="lb"/>then, by his power of illusion, grew ten yojanas in size.
<div n="lb"/>Then Surasā opened her mouth twenty yojanas wide.
<div n="lb"/>Hanūmān then grew thirty yojanas in size and Surasā
<div n="lb"/>opened her mouth forty yojanas wide. In this competi-
<div n="lb"/>tion ultimately when Surasā opened her mouth hundred
<div n="lb"/>yojanas wide, Hanūmān reduced his size to that of a
<div n="lb"/>finger, entered Surasā's mouth and came out through
<div n="lb"/>her ear. Surasā was pleased and blessed Hanūmān.
<div n="lb"/>(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Canto 1).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Surasā lives in the court of Brahmā worshipping
<div n="lb"/>him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 39).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Rohiṇī, mother of Balabhadrarāma, was an incar-
<div n="lb"/>nation of Surasā. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
