SURASĀ I¦. Mother of nāgas (serpents).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Ten daughters were born to Kaśyapaprajā-
pati by his wife Krodhavaśā, daughter of Dakṣa includ-
ing Surasā. From Surasā were born all the nāgas.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 14).
<div n="NI"/>Nāgas and Uragas are two sects of serpents. From Surasā
were born Nāgas and from Kadrū, Uragas. (Vālmiki
Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Canto 14, Verse 28).
<div n="NI"/>Surasā was born from the wrath of Krodhavaśā and the
former had three daughters called Analā, Ruhā and
Vīrudhā. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 61).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Obstructed the passage of Hanūmān.%} To test whether
Hanūmān, who jumped into Laṅkā to seek out Sītā,
possessed power enough for the purpose, Devagandharvas
beckoned Surasā to them and told her as follows: “You
mother of nāgas, do please assume a terrible form like a
big mountain and appear before Hanūmān and obstruct
his passage. As soon as she heard the injunction, she
jumped before Hanūmān and attempted to devour him.
In spite of Hanūmān's earnest pleadings she stood
before him with her mouth opened wide. Hanūmān
then, by his power of illusion, grew ten yojanas in size.
Then Surasā opened her mouth twenty yojanas wide.
Hanūmān then grew thirty yojanas in size and Surasā
opened her mouth forty yojanas wide. In this competi-
tion ultimately when Surasā opened her mouth hundred
yojanas wide, Hanūmān reduced his size to that of a
finger, entered Surasā's mouth and came out through
her ear. Surasā was pleased and blessed Hanūmān.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Canto 1).
