ADṚŚYANTĪ¦, wife of sage Śakti, the son of Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>and mother of sage Parāśara.
<div n="NI"/>Kalmāṣapāda, a king of the Ikṣvāku dynasty reached
<div n="lb"/>the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha during a hunting expedi-
<div n="lb"/>tion when Śakti, eldest of the hundred sons of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha came walking towards him. False pride
<div n="lb"/>prevented either of them from giving way to the
<div n="lb"/>other. The King got angry and whipped Śakti. Śakti
<div n="lb"/>cursed the king and he was converted into a demon.
<div n="lb"/>This happened at a period when sages Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra were at logger-heads. Viśvāmitra got
<div n="lb"/>admitted into the body of King Kalmāṣapāda a
<div n="lb"/>demon called Kiṃkara, and the king set out to take
<div n="lb"/>revenge upon Śakti, the son of Vasiṣṭha. The King
<div n="lb"/>was further promised all support by Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>Kalmāṣapāda ate up all the hundred sons of Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="lb"/>Overcome with grief Vasiṣṭha attempted suicide
<div n="lb"/>many a time. But the spirit (Ātman) did not quit
<div n="lb"/>the body. Thus sunken in grief Vasiṣṭha lived in his
<div n="lb"/>hermitage with Adṛśyantī, wife of Śakti. One day
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha heard distinct sounds of the chanting of
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and Adṛśyantī told him that a child of
<div n="lb"/>his son, Śakti, was developing in her womb and that
<div n="lb"/>the vedic sounds heard were sounds produced by
<div n="lb"/>that son chanting the vedic hymns. Vasiṣṭha thus
<div n="lb"/>was happy to hear that the dynasty will not become
<div n="lb"/>extinct and, so, gave up all ideas of suicide. Another
<div n="lb"/>day Kalmāṣapāda in the guise of the demon hurriedly
<div n="lb"/>came to devour Adṛśyantī and Vasiṣṭha gave him
<div n="lb"/>redemption from the curse. He was restored to his
<div n="lb"/>old state and form. Adṛśyantī duly gave birth to a
<div n="lb"/>son, and the child grew up to become Parāśara,
<div n="lb"/>father of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>While the Pāṇḍavas, in the course of their forest
<div n="lb"/>life, were passing the banks of river Gaṅgā at midnight,
<div n="lb"/>a Gandharva named Aṃgāraparṇa enjoying in the
<div n="lb"/>river-water clashed with Arjuna, and he was defeat-
<div n="lb"/>ed. The story of Adṛśyantī is one of the many
<div n="lb"/>stories told by Aṃgāraparṇa to the Pāṇḍavas. (M.B.
<div n="lb"/>Ādi Parva, Chapters 175-178).
