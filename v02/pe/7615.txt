TṚṆĀVARTA¦. A demon who was the son of Tārakā-
<div n="lb"/>sura. This demon was living serving Kaṃsa. Kaṃsa
<div n="lb"/>once sent Tṛṇāvarta to kill Kṛṣṇa growing up in
<div n="lb"/>Ambāḍi. Tṛṇāvarta, in magic disguise went to the
[Page797-a+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>house of Nandagopa. Even when he entered the place
<div n="lb"/>bad omens were visible. Yaśodā was breast-feeding
<div n="lb"/>baby Kṛṣṇa keeping the babe in her lap. Soon Yaśodā
<div n="lb"/>felt the babe gaining weight and very soon she felt the
<div n="lb"/>weight unbearable and rose up to place the child on a
<div n="lb"/>mat on the ground. But even before that Yaśodā was
<div n="lb"/>fixed to the ground by the weight of the babe. But
<div n="lb"/>somehow she placed the babe on a mat on the ground
<div n="lb"/>and went out to wash her hands and face. When she
<div n="lb"/>came back she could not find the babe on the mat.
<div n="lb"/>Tṛṇāvarta had come in the form of whirl-wind and had
<div n="lb"/>already carried away the child. But after some time the
<div n="lb"/>weight of the babe increased so much that Tṛṇāvarta,
<div n="lb"/>unable to carry the weight, wanted to drop the child to
<div n="lb"/>the ground. But the child stuck on to his neck and
<div n="lb"/>breast tightly and Tṛṇāvarta finding no escape from
<div n="lb"/>the tight hold which suffocated him, fell to the ground
<div n="lb"/>dead on a hard rock. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
