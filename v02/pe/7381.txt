SVĀHĀDEVI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Wife of god Agni (fire). There
is a story about the birth of this goddess, as given below,
in Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9.
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning of creation sufficient arrangements
had not been made for food to be supplied to the
Devas (gods). They were in misery. At last the devas
reached Satyaloka and requested Brahmā to make some
arrangements for their food. Brahmā pacified them by
saying that he would make available to them, the
‘havis’ offered by Brahmins as food. Then Brahmā
meditated on the Mūla-Prakṛti. A particle of Mūla-
Prakṛti appeared before Brahmā and asked him what
boon he required. Brahmā said thus:—Oh Goddess!
The gods are miserable due to lack of food. The fire
is not powerful enough to digest the ‘havis’ offered by
Brahmins in the fire so as to convert them as food for
the gods. The fire would become powerful to digest the
havis only if your esteemed self would reside in fire as
the power of digestion. Only the havis offered, with the
mantra, (spell) ending with the holy name of your
glorious self could be digested by fire and taken to the
gods as food, and they could accept it as food. So it is
my request that your gracious self would become the
power that dwells in fire as the figure of wealth and
prosperity, adored by men and gods.”
<div n="NI"/>But that goddess said that her desire was to get
[Page777-b+ 64]
Śrī Kṛṣṇa as her husband. She did penance to Śrī
Kṛṣṇa, who appeared and said: “Devī! you will take
birth as the daughter of King Nagnajit in Varāha
Kalpa (a world-age) and then you will become my
wife. Now you have to become the wife of Agni under
the name Svāhādevī and become the power of digestion,
and part of the spell (mantra). You and Agni will be
worshipped together by all. From that day onwards
Svāhādevī became the wife of Fire. It is mentioned in
Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 10, that three sons
Pāvaka, Pavamāna and Śuci, were born to the couple.
(See under Devī).
