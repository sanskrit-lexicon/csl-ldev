BĀHUDĀ¦. A holy bath. If one stays in this place for a
<div n="lb"/>night in celibacy and fast, one will get the fruits of
<div n="lb"/>performing a sacrifice to devas (gods). The modern
<div n="lb"/>investigators say that this place is on the bank of river
<div n="lb"/>Dhavala which flows near Avadhi. It is mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 23 that the hermit
<div n="lb"/>Likhita had recovered his lost hand, by bathing in this
<div n="lb"/>holy place and giving oblations to his ancestors.
