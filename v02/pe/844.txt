BĀHUDĀ¦. A holy bath. If one stays in this place for a
night in celibacy and fast, one will get the fruits of
performing a sacrifice to devas (gods). The modern
investigators say that this place is on the bank of river
Dhavala which flows near Avadhi. It is mentioned in
Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 23 that the hermit
Likhita had recovered his lost hand, by bathing in this
holy place and giving oblations to his ancestors.
