MŪLAKA¦, A son of Kumbhakarṇa. Mūlaka was born
on Mūla day and Kumbhakarṇa deeming that day and
the constellation inauspicious threw the baby away. The
abandoned child was brought up by honey-bees giving
the babe honey. When Mūlaka grew up he became a
mighty demon who always tormented people. He was
killed by Sītā with the help of Śrī Rāma. (Ānanda
Rāmāyaṇa, Rājyakāṇḍa).
