VĀSTUPURUṢA¦. In days of yore a ghost of immense
<div n="lb"/>size, who was feared by all other ghosts came into
<div n="lb"/>existence. This ghost was buried inside the earth by
<div n="lb"/>the Devas. This ghost is called Vāstupuruṣa. He is
<div n="lb"/>the deity of whatever we build on the earth. The
<div n="lb"/>offering made to this Vāstupuruṣa on completion of a
<div n="lb"/>house is called “Puravāstubali”. (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 40).
