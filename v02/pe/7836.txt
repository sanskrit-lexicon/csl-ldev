<div n="lb"/>Jambū). Mention is made in the Mahābhārata that
<div n="lb"/>during his conquest Arjuna had gone up to this place
<div n="lb"/>and carried away from there plenty of wealth. It is

<div n="lb"/>ible to human beings. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 28,
<div n="lb"/>Stanzas 7 to 20). The southern end of this place is the
<div n="lb"/>Nīlagiri and the Northern end Mount Meru. The in-
<div n="lb"/>habitants are gifted people, with trees bearing flowers
<div n="lb"/>and fruits, the flowers fragrant and the fruits sweet.
<div n="NI"/>A particular type of tree known as Kṣīrī (milky)
<div n="lb"/>grows here from which milk will flow. There are also trees
<div n="lb"/>which will give you whatever you ask. It was the belief
<div n="lb"/>of ancient people that with the fruits of Kṣīrī, you could
<div n="lb"/>make garments and ornaments. The soil of this
<div n="lb"/>place contains gems and in the sand there is gold.

<div n="lb"/>The average age of the inhabitants of this place is said
<div n="lb"/>to have been eleven thousand years. There is a kind of

<div n="lb"/>dead bodies away to caves. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chap-
<div n="lb"/>ter 8, Stanzas 2 to 13).
