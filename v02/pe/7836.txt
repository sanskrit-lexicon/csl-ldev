Jambū). Mention is made in the Mahābhārata that
during his conquest Arjuna had gone up to this place
and carried away from there plenty of wealth. It is

Stanzas 7 to 20). The southern end of this place is the
Nīlagiri and the Northern end Mount Meru. The in-
habitants are gifted people, with trees bearing flowers
and fruits, the flowers fragrant and the fruits sweet.

grows here from which milk will flow. There are also trees
which will give you whatever you ask. It was the belief
of ancient people that with the fruits of Kṣīrī, you could
make garments and ornaments. The soil of this
place contains gems and in the sand there is gold.
