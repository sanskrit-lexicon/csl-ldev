LOKA¦.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Origin of Loka.%} There are several views in the
Purāṇas regarding the origin of Loka or the world
(Universe).
<div n="NI"/>(i) In the beginning of the universe Mahāviṣṇu alone
[Page455-b+ 65]
stood as the Eternal, unseen, unheard, unknown entity.
Then there was neither sky nor day nor night. When
the time of creation came Prakṛti entered Viṣṇu as
Puruṣa creating emotion. From emotion arose Mahat
or the Great Principle and from Mahat arose cosmic
egoism (Ahaṅkāra). Ahaṅkāra divided itself into
Vaikārika, Taijasa and Tāmasa. From Ahaṅkāra arose
Ākāśa with the quality of sound and from Ākāśa came
the air having the quality of touch and from air came
fire having the quality of colour and from fire came
water having the quality of taste and from water came
earth with the quality of smell. All these were born of
tāmasic egoism. From taijasic egoism came into being the
organs of sense. From the Vaikārika egoism came the
ten Vaikārika devas and the eleventh organ of sense,
the mind. After that Mahāviṣṇu discharged his virility
into water and that virility is life. (Chapter 17, Agni
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahaviṣṇu with a view to creating many different
kinds of living things created water first and threw his
whole energy into it. That energy grew into a golden
mass of an egg and Brahmā was born from that egg.
Mahāviṣṇu broke that egg into two, making one half
heaven and the other earth. Between the two halves he
created the sky. The earth was floating on the waters
and he fixed it by anchoring it at ten sides. Then he
created Prajāpati, Kāla, Manas, Vāk, Kāma, Krodha
and Rati. Then he created thunder, lightning, clouds,
rainbows and birds. Then for yajñasiddhi he created
from his face Ṛgveda, Yajurveda and Sāmaveda. He
did sacrifices with them. From his hands he created
the different Bhūtagrāmas and Sanatkumāras. He
created Rudra out of Krodha. From his mind were
born Marīci, Atri, Aṅgiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu
and Vasiṣṭha. He made these seven Brahmarṣis. These
seven Brahmarṣis and Rudra began to create the prajās.
Then Prajāpati divided his body into two. One half of
it became man and the other woman. Brahmā started
creation through that woman. (Chapter 18; Agni
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In the beginning Mahāviṣṇu in the form of a
child lay on a leaf of the Banyan tree. Lying there the
Lord began to think like this, “Who am I? Who created
me? Why was I created? What should I do here?”
At once from the sky came a voice which said:—
<Poem>Sarvaṃ khalvidamevāhaṃ
Nāṅyadasti sanātanam /</Poem>
(All these am I. There is nothing eternal except me).
The Lord was surprised by the voice and there appear-
ed before him Mahādevī with four hands bearing the
Śaṅkha, Cakra, Gadā and Padma one in each hand.
She wore divine garments and ornaments and was accom-
panied by Prosperity as her maid. She was surrounded
by such forces as Rati Bhūti, Buddhi, Mati, Kīrti, Smṛti,
Dhṛti, Śraddhā, Medhā, Svadhā, Svāhā, Kṣudhā, Nidrā,
Dayā, Gati, Tuṣṭi, Puṣṭi, Kṣamā, Lajjā, Jṛmbhā and
Tandrī. Devī then addressed Mahāviṣṇu thus: “Why
wonder? You have always come into being whenever
creation was started by the greatness of great powers. The
Supreme Being is without quality of any kind. We are all
with quality. You have predominance of Sattvaguṇa.
From your navel will arise Brahmā who will be dominat-
ed by Rajoguṇa and from the centre of the forehead
of Brahmā will be born Rudra with Tamoguṇa
predominant in him. Brahmā by the power of his pen-
[Page456-a+ 65]
ance will acquire the energy to create and he will then
create the world. You will be the protector of this
world which will in the end be destroyed by Rudra. I
am the sāttvic power to help you in your work and I
am always at your service.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Brahmā and Rudra were born and Brahmā
started his creation. (1st Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) In times of old during the great deluge everything
in this universe became extinct. It went on like that
for some time and then the five elements and Brahmā
were born. Brahmā was born in a lotus. Brahmā
decided there should be mud beneath the lotus. He
went down through the stem of the lotus and travelled
for a thousand years and yet did not find the earth. He
came back and sitting inside the lotus started doing
penance. After a thousand years Madhu-Kaiṭabhas
rushed to attack Brahmā (See under Kaiṭabha).
<div n="NI"/>Fearing them Brahmā went under water again. As he
went deep down he saw a great man sleeping there. It
was Mahāviṣṇu and then only he knew he was sitting
on the lotus originating from the navel of Mahāviṣṇu.
Mahāviṣṇu killed Madhu Kaiṭabhas and gave per-
mission to start creation and Brahmā started his work
of creation.
<div n="NI"/>(v) Before the origin of the Universe the shapeless
qualityless Parāśakti permeated everything. From it
there were born three powers: Jñānaśakti, Kriyāśakti
and Arthaśakti. The power of Sattvaguṇa was Jñāna-
śakti, the power of Rajoguṇa was Kriyāśakti and the
power of Tamoguṇa was Arthaśakti. From the divine
power of Tāmasa came the five basic things, sound,
colour, touch, taste and smell. The quality of the sky
was sound, the quality of air was touch, the quality of
fire was colour, the quality of water was taste and the
quality of earth was smell.
<div n="NI"/>Rajoguṇa was born of Kriyāśakti. The five organs of
senses, ear, eye, nose, tongue and skin and the five
organs of work, hand, leg, speech, organ of excretion
and the organ of sex and the five breaths, Prāṇa, Apāna,
Vyāna, Samāna and Udāna are the offsprings of Rājasa.
These are the forms of Kriyāśakti. These are controlled
by the favourable activity of Cicchakti. The five gods
controlling the sense-organs like Vāyu, Sūrya, Pāśī
and Aśvinīdevas and the four gods controlling intelli-
gence, conscience etc. like Candra, Brahmā, Rudra,
and Kṣetrajña and the mind are ten Tattvas (Princi-
ples) born of sāttvika empowered with Jñānaśakti.
<div n="NI"/>All the Tattvas were made into five basic elements
through the process of Pañcīkaraṇa and the Brahmāṇḍa
originated from it.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The constitution of Brahmāṇḍa.%} The Brahmāṇḍa is made
up of seven Kośas (coverings). The one in the extreme
interior is very small. The second Kośa originates from
the centre of the first Kośa. The third Kośa also has
its origin from the first one. Each of them envelops
the one before it. The seventh Kośa thus originating
from the first Kośa and bursting forth through the
other six Kośas spreads out for millions of miles around.
If you cut the Brahmāṇḍa longitudinally the one in
the extreme interior is the earth. Then come Bhuvar-
loka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, and
Satyaloka in succession. The worlds in the lower half
are called Pātāla, Rasātala, Mahātala, Talātala Sutala,
Vitala and Atala. From Satyaloka to Atala there are
fourteen lokas. The Brahmāṇḍa consists of the Sūrya,
[Page456-b+ 65]
Candra, Stars, Śukra, Budha, Aṅgāraka, Bṛhaspati,
Śani, Saptarṣis, Dhruva, Śiṃśumāra and Rāhu, called
the Jyotiścakra. Besides these there are twentyeight
hells also. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃsa 1).
<div n="NI"/>Rāhu is ten thousand yojanas below Sūrya. Ten thou-
sand yojanas below Rāhu is the loka of Siddhavidyā-
dharas. Below that up to the path of the clouds is the
loka of the demons, genū and manes. Hundred yojanas
below this is the Bhūloka (earth). Ten thousand yojanas
below the earth and as many yojanas below the world
above each are Atala, Vitala Sutala, Talātala, Mahātala
Rasātala and Pātāla. (5th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Origin of life.%} Brahmā originated from the navel
of Mahāviṣṇu. Brahmā started creation after obtaining
permission from Viṣṇu. In the beginning Brahmā created
from the mind Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha,
Kratu, and Pulastya. They are therefore called the
Mānasaputras of Brahmā. (Manas = mind, Putra, =
son). From his wrath came Rudra, from his lap came
Nārada, from his right thumb Dakṣa, from his mind
Sanaka and others and from his left thumb, Vīraṇī.
Dakṣa married Vīraṇī.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa got five thousand sons of Vīraṇī. They also got
sons. When the population began to increase thus
Nārada intervened and questioned the advisability of
increasing the population before knowing the capacity of
the earth. The sons of Dakṣa realised the sense in it
and started to have a survey of the earth. Dakṣa was
disappointed that the children left him without showing
any interest in the work of creation. So he produced
another five thousand sons and asked them to start the
work of creation. But they were also sent away as
before by Nārada. Dakṣa became angry and he created
sixty daughters.
<div n="NI"/>He gave thirteen daughters to Kaśyapa, ten to Dharma,
twentyseven to Candra, two to Bhṛgu, four to Ariṣṭa-
nemi, two to Kṛtāśva, and two to Aṅgiras. Of these
most of the living things in the world were born to
Kaśyapa. (7th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Kaśyapa was the last of the Prajāpatis. Kaśyapa
married the daughters of Dakṣa named Aditi, Diti,
Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu, and Analā.
Aditi got thirtythree sons and their family consists of the
thirtythree crores of Devas. From Diti were born the
daityas or asuras. From Danu was born the dānava
Hayagrīva. Kālikā got two sons, Naraka and Kālaka.
Tāmrā got five daughters, Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛta-
rāṣṭrī and Śukī. Krauñcī gave birth to owls, Bhāsī
to Bhāsas and Śyeni to Śyenas (Vultures, Kites etc.).
Dhṛtarāṣṭrī gave birth to Haṃsas, Kalahaṃsas and
Kokas. Śukī gave birth to Natā and Nāta in turn to
Vinatā. Krodhavaśā gave birth to ten daughters;
Mṛgī, Mṛgamandā, Harī, Bhadramadā, Mātaṅgī,
Śārdūlī, Śvetā, Surabhi, Surasā and Kadrū. Of these
Mṛgī gave birth to beasts, Mrgamandā to trees and
plants. Lions and monkeys are the children of Hari,
Bhadramadā got a daughter named Irāvatī. Airāvata
was the son of Irāvatī. From Mātaṅgī were born the
elephants and from Śārdūlī the tigers. The Aṣṭadigga-
jas are the sons of Śvetā. Surabhi got two daughters
named Rohiṇī and Gandharvī. Cows are the children
of Rohiṇī and horses are the children of Gandharvī.
Serpents are the sons of Surasā and Kadrū gave birth
to snakes. From Manu were born men. Trees are the
sons of Analā. Vinatā got two sons named Aruṇa and
[Page457-a+ 63]
Garuḍa. To Aruṇa were born two sons, Jaṭāyu and
Sampāti.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The end of the World%}—There are different views in
the Purāṇas regarding the end of the world. The differ-
ent Purāṇas give different views. For knowing the
views of Agni Purāṇa on the subject see under the
heading ‘Pralaya’. The eleventh Skandha of Bhāgavata
gives the following theory regarding the end of the
world.
<div n="NI"/>All the material objects of the world will become
illusory. Fire will increase. There will be no rains for
hundred years together. The World will be burnt by
the heat. The heat will go down to the head of Ananta
who holds this world on his head. The Saptameghas
(Seven Clouds) will rise up in the sunshine infested
with the poisonous breath of Ananta. Then rains will
start pouring down in streams as thick as the trunk of
an elephant. Everything will be drowned in that water.
Viṣṇu alone will be left above the vast expanse of
water. (See under Manvantara).
