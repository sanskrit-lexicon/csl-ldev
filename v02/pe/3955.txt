LAKṢMĪ I¦. Consort of Mahāviṣṇu.
[Page449-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Devī originated from the left side of
<div n="lb"/>Paramātmā (Supreme Being). The beautiful Devī by
<div n="lb"/>a command from the Supreme Being divided herself
<div n="lb"/>into two enchanting damsels both equal in figure,
<div n="lb"/>splendour, age, majesty, adornment and love. One of
<div n="lb"/>these was Lakṣmīdevī and the other Rādhādevī. That
<div n="lb"/>born of the left was Ramā and that of the right, Rādhā.
<div n="lb"/>Rādhā wedded herself to the two-handed Śrī Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Lakṣmī also wanted the same person and so Bhaga-
<div n="lb"/>vān himself became two, Śri Kṛṣṇa from the left side
<div n="lb"/>as a two-handed person and as four-handed
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu from the right side. (9th Skandha. Devī
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Different incarnations of Lakṣmī.%} Lakṣmī had many
<div n="lb"/>incarnations and she had been on earth in different
<div n="lb"/>forms at different times. They are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Birth from the ocean of milk.%} Once the Devas
<div n="lb"/>became aged and afflicted with rugosity and
<div n="lb"/>grey hairs by a curse of Durvāsas. Indra lost his
<div n="lb"/>majesty and was ousted from Svarga. Svargalakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>deserted Devaloka and went to Vaikuṇṭha and merged
<div n="lb"/>with Mahālakṣmī.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas were greatly aggrieved on account of this
<div n="lb"/>plight of theirs and they went to Satyaloka and
<div n="lb"/>appealed to Brahmā to find a solution to their difficult-
<div n="lb"/>ies. Brahmā was helpless in the matter and so they
<div n="lb"/>all together went to Vaikuṇṭha and represented their
<div n="lb"/>grievances before Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu smiled and told
<div n="lb"/>Mahālakṣmī thus: “You go and be born as Kṣīra-
<div n="lb"/>sāgarakanyakā using a part of your inherent power
<div n="lb"/>and do give relief to the Devas.” Accordingly when
<div n="lb"/>the Devas conducted the churning of the ocean of milk
<div n="lb"/>(Kṣīrābdhimathana) Mahālakṣmī, the goddess of
<div n="lb"/>beauty, wealth and prosperity arose from the ocean as
<div n="lb"/>Kṣīrasāgarakanyakā (Daughter of the ocean of milk)
<div n="lb"/>and blessed the Devas and put a Vanamālā (garland
<div n="lb"/>of wild flowers) on Mahāviṣṇu. The Devas got back
<div n="lb"/>all their lost wealth and prosperity and they, on going
<div n="lb"/>to Devaloka, worshipped Lakṣmīdevī properly. (9th
<div n="lb"/>Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahālakṣmī was born as a mare. (See under
<div n="lb"/>Ekavīra, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Mahālakṣmī was born as the Tulasī plant (Holy
<div n="lb"/>Basil. (See under Tulasī.)
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Mahālakṣmī was born as Sītā and Vedavatī. (See
<div n="lb"/>under Sītā).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Other births:%} Mahālakṣmī was born as a daughter
<div n="lb"/>to the sage Bhṛgu of Khyāti. When Mahāviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>incarnated as Sūrya, Lakṣmī rose up from the lotus.
<div n="lb"/>When Viṣṇu became Paraśurāma, Lakṣmī became
<div n="lb"/>the earth. When Mahāviṣṇu incarnated as Śrī Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī became Sītā and when Viṣṇu was born as Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb"/>Lakṣmī became Rādhā. Thus whenever and wherever
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu changed his form, Mahālakṣmī also chang-
<div n="lb"/>ed hers to form part of the changed life. (Chapter 9,
<div n="lb"/>Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mahālakṣmī cursed Viṣṇu.%} Once Mahālakṣmī cursed
<div n="lb"/>Mahāviṣṇu, her husband, that his head would drop off
<div n="lb"/>from his body. (See under Cital).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Two forms of Lakṣmī.%} Mahālakṣmī has two forms,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu-priyā Lakṣmī and Rājyalakṣmī. The former is the
<div n="lb"/>embodiment of chastity and virtuousness. The latter
<div n="lb"/>goes about courting Kings. Rājyalakṣmī is fickle and
<div n="lb"/>unsteady. This Lakṣmī enters all places where virtue
<div n="lb"/>and charity are found and as soon as these two vanish
[Page450-a+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>from any place Rājyalakṣmī will also vanish from that
<div n="lb"/>place.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Lakṣmī in cow-dung.%} The people of Bhārata consider
<div n="lb"/>cow dung as very sacred and there is a story in the 82nd
<div n="lb"/>Chapter of Anuśāsana Parva as to how cow-dung be-
<div n="lb"/>came so sacred;
<div n="NI"/>Once a herd of cows was grazing in a large grassy ground
<div n="lb"/>when Lakṣmī happened to pass that way. Mahālakṣmī
<div n="lb"/>was pleased at the cows and bade them ask for any boon
<div n="lb"/>they wanted. The cows were prosperity incarnate and
<div n="lb"/>contented and they rejected the offer of Lakṣmī and
<div n="lb"/>when pressed again by her, said that they would like to
<div n="lb"/>have prosperity deposited in their dung also. Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>lakṣmī did so and so even today it is believed that the
<div n="lb"/>cowdung is embedded with prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Other details:%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Lakṣmī stays in the court of Kubera. (Śloka 19,
<div n="lb"/>Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahālakṣmī is installed in temples as an idol carrying
<div n="lb"/>a lotus in her right hand and a Bilva fruit in her left
<div n="lb"/>hand. (Chapter 50, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Lakṣmīdevī stays in the court of Brahmā also.
<div n="lb"/>(Śloka 41, Chapter 11, Sabhā Parva).
