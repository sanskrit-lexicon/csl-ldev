RATI I¦. Wife of Kāmadeva and some Purāṇas hold
<div n="lb"/>the view that Kāma was the son of Dharma whose
<div n="lb"/>father was Brahmā. But, the story of Kāma and Rati
<div n="lb"/>is described in the Kālikāpurāṇa as follows.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā created ten prajāpatis. A beautiful lady
<div n="lb"/>called Sandhyā was his next creation. As soon as she was
<div n="lb"/>born, seeing her exquisite beauty Brahmā and the prajā-
<div n="lb"/>patis jumped to their feet. All of them thought in the
<div n="lb"/>same way. While the court of Brahmā was in such a
<div n="lb"/>perplexed confusion, an extremely handsome person
<div n="lb"/>emerged from his mind. Fish was the symbol on his
<div n="lb"/>flag, and he aked Brahmā thus: “Oh father, what
<div n="lb"/>should I do? Give me a suitable name and you should
<div n="lb"/>also decide upon a place and position and also a wife
<div n="lb"/>for me.” Brahmā told him as follows:—“You be moving
<div n="lb"/>about everywhere in this world (full of men and-
<div n="lb"/>women) engaged in the eternal function of creation with
<div n="lb"/>the five arrows of flower in your hands and thus multiply
<div n="lb"/>the population. Your arrows will go everywhere and no
<div n="lb"/>one, not even the Devas will dare to obstruct your
<div n="lb"/>arrows. Everyone will yield to your behests. Viṣṇu, Śiva
<div n="lb"/>and I also will yield before your arrows. You will enter
<div n="lb"/>the hearts of living beings in invisible form and giving
<div n="lb"/>them happiness engage yourself in eternal creation. The
<div n="lb"/>chief aim and object of your arrows of flower will be the
<div n="lb"/>hearts of living beings. You will be given a suitable
<div n="lb"/>name just now.”
<div n="NI"/>The prajāpatis, who understood the wish of Brahmā,
<div n="lb"/>after mutual consultation said: “You emerged churning
<div n="lb"/>our minds. Therefore, you will become famous under
<div n="lb"/>the name Manmatha (he who churns the mind). You
<div n="lb"/>will lay low Śiva's haughtiness and conceit. Oh! best
<div n="lb"/>among men, Dakṣa, chief among the prajāpatis, will
<div n="lb"/>give you a wife.”
<div n="NI"/>Happily pleased at the above words of Brahmā Kāma
<div n="lb"/>held up in his hands the bow and arrows of flowers
<div n="lb"/>and decided to shoot five arrows, i.e. harṣaṇam (pleas-
<div n="lb"/>ing or gladdening), Rocanam (attracting or tempting),
<div n="lb"/>mohanam (deluding or infatuating), śoṣaṇam (weaken-
<div n="lb"/>ing) and māraṇam (killing). He decided to use the
<div n="lb"/>arrows first against Brahmā and then against the prajā-
<div n="lb"/>patis. Accordingly the arrows shot forth and Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>and all the prajāpatis overwhelmed by sexual passion
<div n="lb"/>stared at Sandhyādevī. Sandhyā also got excited and
<div n="lb"/>from her body sprouted up 49 parts; 64 kalās (arts)
<div n="lb"/>also were born from her. She used incessantly against
<div n="lb"/>the leaders of the world (Brahmā and others) who
<div n="lb"/>were downed by the arrows of sexual passion, arrows
<div n="lb"/>dear to Manmatha. The expressions of Brahmā made
<div n="lb"/>Sandhyā sick with love.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva, who was just then travelling along the sky, seeing
<div n="lb"/>the boisterous exhibitions of passion by Brahmā and
<div n="lb"/>others alighted there. He ridiculed Brahmā for his dis-
<div n="lb"/>play of passion towards his own daughter Sandhyā and
<div n="lb"/>spoke further like this: “This Kāma too is a fool. He
<div n="lb"/>tested his arrows here itself, he has no sense of propriety
<div n="lb"/>and discretion.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā was thoroughly ashamed at the words of Śiva.
<div n="lb"/>He perspired and swept with his hands the drops of
<div n="lb"/>sweat that oozed from his body. With great difficulty he
<div n="lb"/>controlled his passion and gave up Sandhyā. From
[Page645-a+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>the drops of sweat falling on the ground from the body
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmā were born the pitṛs called Agniṣvāttas and
<div n="lb"/>the Barhiṣadas, the former 64,000 in number and the
<div n="lb"/>latter 4,80,000. Drops of sweat from the bodies of the
<div n="lb"/>prajāpatis also fell on the ground and from them were
<div n="lb"/>born the Devas. The pitṛs called Somapās are the sons
<div n="lb"/>of Kratu; those called Svakālikas are the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha; sons of Pulastya are called Ājyapās and
<div n="lb"/>Havirbhuks are the sons of Aṅgiras.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā, who was angry that Kāma shot his arrows
<div n="lb"/>against him in the presence of Śiva cursed the former
<div n="lb"/>that he would be burnt to ashes in the fire of Śiva's
<div n="lb"/>eyes, and Kāma trembling with fear at the curse pros-
<div n="lb"/>trated at the feet of Brahmā and wept Then Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>said that though he would die in the fire of Śiva's eyes,
<div n="lb"/>he would be born again.
<div n="NI"/>From the drops of perspiration that fell on the ground
<div n="lb"/>from Dakṣa's body arose a beautiful woman, and Dakṣa
<div n="lb"/>told Kāma that the woman, his daughter would
<div n="lb"/>become famous as Rati devī. Dakṣa gave Rati Devī
<div n="lb"/>to Kāma to be his wife. Thus did Rati become
<div n="lb"/>Kāma's wife. (For the second birth of Rati see under
<div n="lb"/>Pradyumna and for other details see under Kāma.)
