ACALA¦. Subrahmaṇya, who was born from Śiva's
semen which fell into the fire, was made Commander-
in-Chief (Generalissimo) by the gods to kill Tārakāsura.
A large number of warriors and mothers were
assigned to assist him. A woman named Acalā was in-
cluded among those mothers. (M.B. Śalya Parva,
Chapter 40, Verse 14).
