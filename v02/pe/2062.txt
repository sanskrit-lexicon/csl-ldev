DĪNANĀTHA¦. A King who lived in Dvāpara Age. He
<div n="lb"/>was a mighty and famous Vaiṣṇava. But his childless
<div n="lb"/>life distressed him very much. Once he consulted
<div n="lb"/>Gālava about his plight. Gālava assured him that if he
<div n="lb"/>performed a human sacrifice, a son would be born to
<div n="lb"/>him. A handsome, scholarly and highly-born man was
<div n="lb"/>to be sacrificed into the fire, A cripple, a dark-skinned
<div n="lb"/>man or a crude fellow was unsuitable for the purpose.
<div n="lb"/>The King's servants scoured the villages and towns
<div n="lb"/>looking for such a perfect man, but in vain. At last
<div n="lb"/>they reached a country called Daśapura, inhabited by
<div n="lb"/>noble Brāhmaṇas. The women of that place were
<div n="lb"/>reputed for their charming eyes. No man could resist
<div n="lb"/>their fascination. In that lovely city there lived a
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa named Kṛṣṇadeva with his virtuous wife and
<div n="lb"/>three sons. The King's servants requested Kṛṣṇadeva
<div n="lb"/>to give one of his sons to be sacrificed. They offered
<div n="lb"/>four lakhs of gold coins as price. The Brāhmaṇa and
<div n="lb"/>his wife cried bitterly and Kṛṣṇadeva offered himself
<div n="lb"/>instead of his sons. The royal servants seized one of his
<div n="lb"/>sons after throwing gold coins in the house and
<div n="lb"/>prepared to take him away. At this stage the second
<div n="lb"/>son of Kṛṣṇadeva came forward and volunteered
<div n="lb"/>himself. They agreed and he accompanied them to the
<div n="lb"/>palace. On their way they met the sage Viśvāmitra.
<div n="lb"/>He asked them to release the boy but they refused to
<div n="lb"/>set him free. The sage followed them to the palace and
<div n="lb"/>undertook to perform a sacrifice which would bless the
<div n="lb"/>King with progeny without a human sacrifice. The
<div n="lb"/>King accepted the offer and thus the boy was saved.
<div n="lb"/>(Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 12).
