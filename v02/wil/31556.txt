.²5 Devotion, spiritual worship of GOD, or union with the Supreme Being by means
of abstract contemplation; this does not necessarily imply an abandonment of the
world or relinquishment of the usual observances of religion, but it involves
internal indifference to objects of pleasure and pain, and utter disregard of
the consequences or fruit of ceremonial rites.
.²6 The particular practice of the preceding sort of devotion, or the exercise
of that abstraction by which union with GOD is supposed to be obtained; in the
{%Gītā%} it is described as sitting on {%Kuśa%} grass, with the body firm,
the eyes fixed on the tip of the nose, and the mind intent on the Deity; in the

in the lower part of the body, and the etherial spirit placed in the head, are
supposed to be brought into combination in the brain, when the devotee becomes
united with BRAHMA.

or GOD; it is the same as the {%Pātañjali%} doctrine, and constitutes one of

worship of ŚIVA and DURGĀ especially.

the ecliptic, and used in calculating the longitudes of the sun and moon; each
{%Yogas%} has a distinct name; astrologers also enumerate twenty-eight
{%Yogas%} differently named from the foregoing, and corresponding with the
twenty-eight {%Nakṣatras,%} or the divisions of the moon's path, but varying
according to the day of the week.
