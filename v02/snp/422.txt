śālī¦
<div n="P"/>I cannot find śālī in any text available to me. Acc. to the PW, it
<div n="lb"/>is Nigella indica Roxb. (Rā.nigh. in Śkdr.). This plant is usually cal-
<div n="lb"/>led kṛṣṇajīraka. The Rā.nigh. (Ānandāśrama ed.) does not mention śālī
<div n="lb"/>as one of its synonyms, but kālī; śālī may be an error to be found in
<div n="lb"/>some Mss. or early editions of the Rā.nigh.
