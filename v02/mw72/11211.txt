[Page0160-b+ 73]
<div n="lb"/>pressing) towards, near to (opposed to {%apa,%} away), by
<div n="lb"/>the side of, with, together with, under, down (e. g. {%upa-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%gam,%} to go near, undergo; {%upa-gamana,%} approach-
<div n="lb"/>ing. In the Veda the verb has sometimes to be supplied
<div n="lb"/>from the context, and sometimes {%upa%} is placed after the
<div n="lb"/>verb with which it ought to have been compounded,
<div n="lb"/>e. g. {%āyayur upa = upāyayuḥ,%} they approached).
<div n="P"/>(As unconnected with verbs and prefixed to nouns
<div n="lb"/>{%upa%} expresses) direction towards, nearness, contiguity
<div n="lb"/>in space, time, number, degree, resemblance, and re-
<div n="lb"/>lationship, but with the idea of subordination and inferi-
<div n="lb"/>ority (e. g. {%upa-kaniṣṭhikā,%} the finger next to the
<div n="lb"/>little finger; {%upa-purāṇam,%} a secondary or subordinate
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa; {%upa-daśa,%} nearly ten); sometimes forming
<div n="lb"/>with the nouns to which it is prefixed compound ad-
<div n="lb"/>verbs (e. g. {%upa-mūlam,%} at the root; {%upa-pūrva-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%rātram,%} towards the beginning of night; {%upa-kūpe,%}
<div n="lb"/>near a well), which adverbs lose their adverbial ter-
<div n="lb"/>minations if they are again compounded with nouns
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%upakūpa-jalāśaya,%} a reservoir in the neigh-
<div n="lb"/>bourhood of a well). Prefixed to proper names {%upa%}
<div n="lb"/>may express in classical literature ‘a younger brother’
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%Upendra,%} ‘the younger brother of Indra’), and
<div n="lb"/>in Buddhist literature ‘a son.’
<div n="P"/>(As a separable adverb {%upa%} rarely expresses) thereto,
<div n="lb"/>further, moreover (e. g. {%tatra upa brahma yo veda,%}
<div n="lb"/>who further knows the Veda).
<div n="P"/>(As a separable preposition with locative) near to,
<div n="lb"/>towards, in the direction of, under, below (e. g. {%upa%}
<div n="lb"/>{%āśāḥ,%} towards the regions); near to, at, on, upon; at
<div n="lb"/>the time of, upon, up to, in, above (with loc., e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%upa sānuṣu,%} on the tops of the mountains); with,
<div n="lb"/>together with, at the same time with, according to
<div n="lb"/>(with inst., e. g. {%upa dharmabhiḥ,%} according to the
<div n="lb"/>rules of duty).
<div n="P"/>Besides the meanings given above {%upa%} is said to
<div n="lb"/>imply disease, extinction; ornament; command; re-
<div n="lb"/>proof; undertaking; giving; killing; diffusing; wish;
<div n="lb"/>power; effort; resemblance, &c.; [cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">ὑπό</lang> Lat.
