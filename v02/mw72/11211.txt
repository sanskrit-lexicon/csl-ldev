{#उप#}¦ {%upa,%} a prefix to verbs and nouns (ex-

pressing) towards, near to (opposed to {%apa,%} away), by
the side of, with, together with, under, down (e. g. {%upa-%}
{%gam,%} to go near, undergo; {%upa-gamana,%} approach-
ing. In the Veda the verb has sometimes to be supplied
from the context, and sometimes {%upa%} is placed after the
verb with which it ought to have been compounded,
e. g. {%āyayur upa = upāyayuḥ,%} they approached).
<div n="P"/>(As unconnected with verbs and prefixed to nouns
{%upa%} expresses) direction towards, nearness, contiguity
in space, time, number, degree, resemblance, and re-
lationship, but with the idea of subordination and inferi-
ority (e. g. {%upa-kaniṣṭhikā,%} the finger next to the
little finger; {%upa-purāṇam,%} a secondary or subordinate
Purāṇa; {%upa-daśa,%} nearly ten); sometimes forming
with the nouns to which it is prefixed compound ad-
verbs (e. g. {%upa-mūlam,%} at the root; {%upa-pūrva-%}
{%rātram,%} towards the beginning of night; {%upa-kūpe,%}
near a well), which adverbs lose their adverbial ter-
minations if they are again compounded with nouns
(e. g. {%upakūpa-jalāśaya,%} a reservoir in the neigh-
bourhood of a well). Prefixed to proper names {%upa%}
may express in classical literature ‘a younger brother’
(e. g. {%Upendra,%} ‘the younger brother of Indra’), and
in Buddhist literature ‘a son.’
<div n="P"/>(As a separable adverb {%upa%} rarely expresses) thereto,
further, moreover (e. g. {%tatra upa brahma yo veda,%}
who further knows the Veda).
<div n="P"/>(As a separable preposition with locative) near to,
towards, in the direction of, under, below (e. g. {%upa%}
{%āśāḥ,%} towards the regions); near to, at, on, upon; at
the time of, upon, up to, in, above (with loc., e. g.
{%upa sānuṣu,%} on the tops of the mountains); with,
together with, at the same time with, according to
(with inst., e. g. {%upa dharmabhiḥ,%} according to the
rules of duty).
<div n="P"/>Besides the meanings given above {%upa%} is said to
imply disease, extinction; ornament; command; re-
proof; undertaking; giving; killing; diffusing; wish;
power; effort; resemblance, &c.; [cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">ὑπό</lang> Lat.
