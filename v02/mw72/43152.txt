1. 8782 &c., the personified Vindhya mountain,
jealous of Himālaya, demanded that the sun should
revolve round him in the same way as about Meru,
which the sun declining to do, the Vindhya then began
to elevate himself that he might bar the progress of
both sun and moon; the gods alarmed, asked the
aid of the saint Agastya, who approached the moun-
tain and requested that by bending down he would
afford him an easy passage to the South country,
begging at the same time that he would retain a low
position till his return; this the mountain promised
to do, but Agastya never returned, and the Vindhya
range consequently never attained the elevation of
the Himālaya); a hunter; ({%ā%}), f. a kind of plant
