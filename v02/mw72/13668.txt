{#कम्#} 1¦. {%kam,%} ind. (Gr. <lang n="greek">κεν</lang>), well, bene (op-
<div n="lb"/>posed to {%akam,%} ‘badly’), a particle placed after the
<div n="lb"/>word to which it belongs with an affirmative sense
<div n="lb"/>(Well, Yes), which sense, however, is generally so weak
<div n="lb"/>that the Indian grammarians are perhaps right in
<div n="lb"/>enumerating {%kam%} among the expletives; it is often
<div n="lb"/>found attached to a dat. case, giving to the latter a
<div n="lb"/>stronger meaning, and is generally placed at the end
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāda (e. g. {%ajījana oskadhīr bhojanāya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kam,%} thou didst create the plants for actual food);
<div n="lb"/>it is also used as an enclitic with the particles {%nu, su,%}
<div n="lb"/>and {%hi,%} but is nevertheless treated in the Padapāṭha
<div n="lb"/>as a separate word. Rarely {%kam%} seems to be used,
<div n="lb"/>like {%kad%} and {%kim,%} as an interrogative particle; some-
<div n="lb"/>times it occurs, like {%kim%} and {%kad,%} at the beginning
[Page0203-b+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>of compounds, marking the strange or unusual cha-
<div n="lb"/>racter of anything, [cf. {%kandarpa%}]: according to
<div n="lb"/>native lexicographers {%kam%} means also head; water;
<div n="lb"/>food. {%—Kam-vat, ān, atī, at,%} Ved. lovely.
