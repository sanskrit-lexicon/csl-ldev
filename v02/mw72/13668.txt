{#कम्#} 1¦. {%kam,%} ind. (Gr. <lang n="greek">κεν</lang>), well, bene (op-
posed to {%akam,%} ‘badly’), a particle placed after the
word to which it belongs with an affirmative sense
(Well, Yes), which sense, however, is generally so weak
that the Indian grammarians are perhaps right in
enumerating {%kam%} among the expletives; it is often
found attached to a dat. case, giving to the latter a
stronger meaning, and is generally placed at the end
of the Pāda (e. g. {%ajījana oskadhīr bhojanāya%}
{%kam,%} thou didst create the plants for actual food);
it is also used as an enclitic with the particles {%nu, su,%}
and {%hi,%} but is nevertheless treated in the Padapāṭha
as a separate word. Rarely {%kam%} seems to be used,
like {%kad%} and {%kim,%} as an interrogative particle; some-
times it occurs, like {%kim%} and {%kad,%} at the beginning
[Page0203-b+ 80]
of compounds, marking the strange or unusual cha-
racter of anything, [cf. {%kandarpa%}]: according to
native lexicographers {%kam%} means also head; water;
food. {%—Kam-vat, ān, atī, at,%} Ved. lovely.
