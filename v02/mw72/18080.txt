{#च#} 2¦. {%ca,%} ind. (a particle and conjunction
<div n="lb"/>usually translateable by) and, both, also, moreover,
<div n="lb"/>as well as. This conjunction, like the Lat. <nsi>que</nsi> and
<div n="lb"/>Gr. <lang n="greek">τε,</lang> is usually placed as an enclitic after the word
<div n="lb"/>which it connects with what precedes, and when used
<div n="lb"/>with the personal pronouns these must appear in
<div n="lb"/>their fuller accented forms (e. g. {%tava ca mama ca,%}
<div n="lb"/>both of thee and of me, not {%te ca me ca%}). It con-
<div n="lb"/>nects whole sentences as well as parts of sentences,
<div n="lb"/>and seems to have been originally placed after both
<div n="lb"/>the words or clauses which it joins together, for in
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛg-veda the double {%ca%} occurs much more fre-
<div n="lb"/>quently than the single (e. g. {%ahaṃ ca tvaṃ ca,%}
<div n="lb"/>I and thou). The double {%ca%} may also be used
<div n="lb"/>somewhat redundantly in classical Sanskrit (e. g. {%kva%}
<div n="lb"/>{%hariṇakānāṃ jīvitaṃ cātilolaṃ kva ca vajra-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%sārāḥ śarās te,%} where is both the frail existence of
<div n="lb"/>fawns and where are thy adamantine arrows ?). In the
<div n="lb"/>later literature, however, the first {%ca%} is more usually
<div n="lb"/>omitted (e. g. {%ahaṃ tvaṃ ca%}), and when more than
<div n="lb"/>two things are enumerated only one {%ca%} is often found
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%tejasā yaśasā lakṣmyā sthityā ca parayā,%}
<div n="lb"/>in glory, in fame, in beauty, and in high condition).
<div n="lb"/>Elsewhere, when more than two things are enume-
<div n="lb"/>rated, {%ca%} is placed after some and omitted after others
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%ṛṇa-dātā ca vaidyaśca śrotriyo nadī,%} both
<div n="lb"/>the payer of a debt and a physician [and] a Brāhman
<div n="lb"/>[and] a river). In the Veda and even in classical
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit, when the double {%ca%} would generally be
<div n="lb"/>used, the second may occasionally be omitted (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%Indraśca Somaḥ,%} both Indra [and] Soma; {%dur-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhedyaśca āśu-sandheyaḥ,%} both difficult to be
<div n="lb"/>divided [and] quickly to be united). Rarely {%ca%} may
<div n="lb"/>imply a reference to certain other words which are
<div n="lb"/>not expressed (e. g. {%kamaṇḍalau ca karakaḥ,%} the
<div n="lb"/>word {%karaka%} has the meaning ‘pitcher’ and other
<div n="lb"/>meanings).
