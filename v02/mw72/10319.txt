{#उत#} 2¦. {%uta,%} ind. (as a particle of doubt or
deliberation) and, also, even, or. Often used for the
sake of emphasis, especially at the end of a line after
{%iti%} or a verb (e. g. {%sarva-bhūtāni tam pārtha sadā%}
{%paribhavanty uta,%} all creatures, O king, certainly
always despise him).
<div n="P"/>(As an interrogative particle, generally at the begin-
ning of the second or following part of a double in-
terrogation) or, utrum-an (e. g. {%katham nirṇīyate%}
{%kiṃ syān niṣkāraṇo bandhur uta viśvāsa-ghā- %}
[Page0147-c+ 73]
{%takaḥ,%} how can it be decided whether he be a friend
without a motive or a violator of confidence ?). In
this sense it may be strengthened by {%āho%} (e. g. {%kaccit%}
{%tvam asi mānuṣī utāho surāṅganā,%} art thou a
mortal woman or divine ?), or by {%āho-svit%} (e. g.
{%Śālihotraḥ kiṃ nu syād utāhosvid rājā Nalaḥ,%}
can it be Śālihotra or king Nala ?). Rarely {%kim%} is
repeated before {%uta%} used in this sense (e. g. {%kiṃ nu%}
{%svargāt prāptā tasyā rūpeṇa kimuta anyā āgatā,%}
has she arrived from heaven or has another come in
her form ?).
<div n="P"/>(As a particle of wishing, especially at the beginning
of a sentence followed by a potential) would that!
utinam! (e. g. {%uta adhīyīta,%} would that he would
read!).
<div n="P"/>({%Uta%} preceded by {%kim%}) on the contrary, how
much more, how much less (e. g. {%samartho 'si sa-%}
{%hasram api jetuṃ kimuta ekam,%} thou art able to
conquer even a thousand, how much more one ?).
<div n="P"/>({%Uta%} preceded by {%prati%}) on the contrary, rather
(e. g. {%eṣa pṛṣṭo 'smābhir na jalpati hanti%}
{%pratyuta pāṣāṇaiḥ,%} this one questioned by us does
not speak, but rather throws stones at us). {%Uta vā,%}
or else, and (e. g. {%samudrād uta vā purīṣāt,%} from
the sea or from the moisture in the air); {%vā-uta%}
{%vā%} or {%utāho vāpi-vā,%} either — or; {%uta-uta,%} both — 
and (e. g. {%uta balavān uta abalaḥ,%} both the strong
and the weak); {%kim-uta vā,%} whether — or else.
