{#कालिदास#}¦ {%kālidāsa, as,%} m. (fr. {%kālī,%} the
goddess Durgā, and {%dāsa,%} a slave, the final of {%kālī%}
being shortened), N. of a celebrated poet, supposed
to be the author of the Śakuntalā, Vikramorvaśī,
Mālavikāgnimitra, the Megha-dūta, Raghu-vaṃśa,
Nalodaya, and other poems; also of the Śruta-bodha;
he was one of the nine poets or gems of Vikra-
māditya's court, and is supposed to have flourished
in the century preceding the Christian era; the name
is however applied to more persons than one, and
seems, in some measure, to have been used as an
honorary title; the works attributed to this author
are amongst the most elegant compositions in the
Sanskrit language.
