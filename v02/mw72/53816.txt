{%Svarita, as, ā, am,%}¦ sounded; sounded as a note,
pitched; articulated; accented; having the mixed
or circumflex accent, circumflexed; ({%as%}), m. the third
or mixed tone between high and low, which is
thought to correspond with the circumflex accent,
(the other two tones being called Ud-ātta and An-
[Page1163-a+ 74]
udātta, q.q. v.v.; the Ud-ātta sound of a vowel is
said to result from the employing the upper half of
the organs of utterance, and the An-udātta from em-
ploying the lower half, while the Svarita represents
a sustained mixed intonation neither high nor low,
which is well illustrated by the expression {%tiryag-%}
{%gamana,%} i. e. a horizontal or wavy movement of
the hand as distinguished from a direct upward and
downward motion; Pāṇini, however, applies the
term {%an-udātta,%} ‘non-elevated,’ to the neutral accent-
less tone, and uses the term {%sanna-tara%} or {%an-%}
{%udātta-tara%} for ‘the very or proper An-udātta,’ i. e.
the true grave accent which precedes the Udātta;
in I. 2, 31. he calls the Svarita {%sam-āhāra,%} i. e. ‘a
combination’ of the elevated and non-elevated tones;
the Svarita accent is denoted in the Ṛg-veda by a
small upright stroke above the syllable, the Anudātta-
tara by a horizontal mark underneath, and the Udātta
is left unmarked; but the Svarita mark may denote
either a dependent or an independent Svarita, i. e.
one produced by an Udātta immediately preceding
or a real Svarita belonging to the word itself, and
commonly produced by the suppression of an Udātta
syllable; again, as a word is supposed to have only
one real accent, so words which have real Svaritas
of their own do not have Udātta accents; they are
called {%ādi-svarita, madhya-svarita, anta-svarita,%}
according as they have Svaritas on the first, middle,
or last syllable; it must also be borne in mind that
when a dependent Svarita is immediately followed
by an Udātta, the Svarita becomes a kind of Anudātta-
tara, and is so marked, see {%tāthābhāvya;%} there were,
doubtless, different kinds of Svarita pronunciation.)
{%—Svarita-tva, am,%} n. the state of having the Svarita
accent. {%—Svaritopadha (°ta-up°), as, ā, am,%} pre-
ceded by the Svarita; having the penultimate marked
with the Svarita.
