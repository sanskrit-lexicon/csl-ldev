{%Svarita, as, ā, am,%}¦ sounded; sounded as a note,
<div n="lb"/>pitched; articulated; accented; having the mixed
<div n="lb"/>or circumflex accent, circumflexed; ({%as%}), m. the third
<div n="lb"/>or mixed tone between high and low, which is
<div n="lb"/>thought to correspond with the circumflex accent,
<div n="lb"/>(the other two tones being called Ud-ātta and An-
[Page1163-a+ 74]
<div n="lb"/>udātta, q.q. v.v.; the Ud-ātta sound of a vowel is
<div n="lb"/>said to result from the employing the upper half of
<div n="lb"/>the organs of utterance, and the An-udātta from em-
<div n="lb"/>ploying the lower half, while the Svarita represents
<div n="lb"/>a sustained mixed intonation neither high nor low,
<div n="lb"/>which is well illustrated by the expression {%tiryag-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%gamana,%} i. e. a horizontal or wavy movement of
<div n="lb"/>the hand as distinguished from a direct upward and
<div n="lb"/>downward motion; Pāṇini, however, applies the
<div n="lb"/>term {%an-udātta,%} ‘non-elevated,’ to the neutral accent-
<div n="lb"/>less tone, and uses the term {%sanna-tara%} or {%an-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%udātta-tara%} for ‘the very or proper An-udātta,’ i. e.
<div n="lb"/>the true grave accent which precedes the Udātta;
<div n="lb"/>in I. 2, 31. he calls the Svarita {%sam-āhāra,%} i. e. ‘a
<div n="lb"/>combination’ of the elevated and non-elevated tones;
<div n="lb"/>the Svarita accent is denoted in the Ṛg-veda by a
<div n="lb"/>small upright stroke above the syllable, the Anudātta-
<div n="lb"/>tara by a horizontal mark underneath, and the Udātta
<div n="lb"/>is left unmarked; but the Svarita mark may denote
<div n="lb"/>either a dependent or an independent Svarita, i. e.
<div n="lb"/>one produced by an Udātta immediately preceding
<div n="lb"/>or a real Svarita belonging to the word itself, and
<div n="lb"/>commonly produced by the suppression of an Udātta
<div n="lb"/>syllable; again, as a word is supposed to have only
<div n="lb"/>one real accent, so words which have real Svaritas
<div n="lb"/>of their own do not have Udātta accents; they are
<div n="lb"/>called {%ādi-svarita, madhya-svarita, anta-svarita,%}
<div n="lb"/>according as they have Svaritas on the first, middle,
<div n="lb"/>or last syllable; it must also be borne in mind that
<div n="lb"/>when a dependent Svarita is immediately followed
<div n="lb"/>by an Udātta, the Svarita becomes a kind of Anudātta-
<div n="lb"/>tara, and is so marked, see {%tāthābhāvya;%} there were,
<div n="lb"/>doubtless, different kinds of Svarita pronunciation.)
<div n="lb"/>{%—Svarita-tva, am,%} n. the state of having the Svarita
<div n="lb"/>accent. {%—Svaritopadha (°ta-up°), as, ā, am,%} pre-
<div n="lb"/>ceded by the Svarita; having the penultimate marked
<div n="lb"/>with the Svarita.
