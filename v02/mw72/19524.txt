{#जातु#}¦ {%jātu,%} ind. (fr. {%jan ?;%} cf. {%januṣā%} under
{%janus%}), at all, ever; possibly, perhaps; sometimes,
some day, once, once upon a time (e. g. {%kiṃ tena%}
{%jātu jātena,%} what is the use at all of him born ?).
{%Jātu%} is said to be used in connection with the
potential in the sense of ‘not allowing’ (e. g. {%jātu%}
{%vṛṣalaṃ yājayen na marṣayāmi,%} I suffer not
that he should cause an outcast to sacrifice), or with
a present indicative to express censure (e. g. {%jātu%}
{%yājayati vṛṣalam,%} ought he to cause an outcast
to sacrifice ?). In the Veda when {%jātu%} stands at the
beginning of a sentence the verb which follows re-
tains its accent. {%Na jātu,%} not at all, by no means,
never; {%api jātu,%} perhaps, possibly; {%jātu-cit,%} at
some time or other, some day, one day. {%—Jātū-%}
{%ṣṭhira, as, ā, am,%} Ved. eminently strong; (Sāy.)
always strong; or ({%as%}), m., N. of a man.
