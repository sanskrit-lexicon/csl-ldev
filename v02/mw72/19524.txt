{#जातु#}¦ {%jātu,%} ind. (fr. {%jan ?;%} cf. {%januṣā%} under
<div n="lb"/>{%janus%}), at all, ever; possibly, perhaps; sometimes,
<div n="lb"/>some day, once, once upon a time (e. g. {%kiṃ tena%}
<div n="lb"/>{%jātu jātena,%} what is the use at all of him born ?).
<div n="lb"/>{%Jātu%} is said to be used in connection with the
<div n="lb"/>potential in the sense of ‘not allowing’ (e. g. {%jātu%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vṛṣalaṃ yājayen na marṣayāmi,%} I suffer not
<div n="lb"/>that he should cause an outcast to sacrifice), or with
<div n="lb"/>a present indicative to express censure (e. g. {%jātu%}
<div n="lb"/>{%yājayati vṛṣalam,%} ought he to cause an outcast
<div n="lb"/>to sacrifice ?). In the Veda when {%jātu%} stands at the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of a sentence the verb which follows re-
<div n="lb"/>tains its accent. {%Na jātu,%} not at all, by no means,
<div n="lb"/>never; {%api jātu,%} perhaps, possibly; {%jātu-cit,%} at
<div n="lb"/>some time or other, some day, one day. {%—Jātū-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṣṭhira, as, ā, am,%} Ved. eminently strong; (Sāy.)
<div n="lb"/>always strong; or ({%as%}), m., N. of a man.
