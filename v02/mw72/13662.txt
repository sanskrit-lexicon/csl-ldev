(metaphorically) a cloud; the belly; the clouds
which obscure the sun at sunset and sunrise (some-
times they are personified); water; a N. of Rāhu;
a headless trunk (shaped like a barrel), especially one
retaining vitality; ({%as%}), m., N. of an Ātharvaṇa and
Gandharva; N. of a Muni; N. of the Dānava or
Rākṣasa called Danu, who was son of Śrī. (His story
is told in Rāmāy. III. 75. It is there related that
Indra punished him for his insolence in challenging the
god to combat, by striking his head and thighs with
his thunderbolt and so pressing them into his body.
He had enormously long arms and a huge mouth in
his belly. It was predicted that he would not recover
his original shape until killed in a battle with Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa. The whole story probably repre-
sents one of Indra's battles with the clouds.) {%—Ka-%}

decapitation. {%—Kabandha-vadha, as,%} m. ‘the slay-
ing of Kabandha,’ title of a chapter of the Padma-
purāṇa.
