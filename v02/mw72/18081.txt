{%Ca%}¦ may be used for {%vā%} and is then translateable by
‘either,’ ‘or’ (e. g. {%iha cāmutra vā,%} either here or
hereafter; {%strī vā pumān vā yaccānyat sattvam,%}
either a woman or a man or any other being); and
when a negative particle is joined with {%ca%} the
two may then be translated by ‘neither,’ ‘nor.’
Occasionally one {%ca%} or one {%na%} may be omitted (e. g.
{%na ca paribhoktuṃ naiva śaknomi hātum,%} I am
able neither to enjoy nor to abandon; {%na pūrvāhṇe%}
{%na ca parāhṇe,%} neither in the forenoon nor in the
afternoon).
