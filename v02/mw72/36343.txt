{%Manas, as,%}¦ n. mind (in its widest sense as applied
to all the mental powers), intellect, intelligence, un-
derstanding, perception, sense, conscience, will; (in
phil.) the internal organ of perception and cognition,
the faculty or instrument through which thoughts
enter or by which objects of sense affect the soul (in
this sense {%manas%} is always regarded in Hindū phi-
losophy as distinct from the soul [{%ātman, puruṣa%}];
in the Sāṅkhya system it is an internal organ standing
between the organs of perception and the organs of
action, as an eleventh organ which partakes of the
nature of both [cf. {%indriya%}]; the Vedānta doctrine
is very similar, and in both the appropriate functions
or operations of {%manas%} are defined to be {%saṅkalpa,%}
judging, and {%vikalpa,%} doubting; according to the
Nyāya-sūtras, the property of the internal organ
{%manas%} is its not giving rise simultaneously to more
notions than one, hence in this philosophy it is held
to be an atomic organ or inlet to the all-pervading
soul, not allowing this latter, as the thinker or knower,
to receive more than one thought or conception at
[Page0741-b+ 81]
once; according to this system {%manas%} is a {%dravya%}
or substance; it is {%paramāṇu-rūpa,%} in the form of
an atom, and though distinct from the all-pervading
soul is like it, {%nitya,%} eternal; in the Sāṅkhya {%manas,%}
as the internal organ whose {%vṛtti%} or function is
{%saṅkalpa,%} judging or determining, has a special
connection with both {%buddhi,%} whose function is
{%adhyavasāya%} or ascertainment, and {%ahaṅkāra,%} whose
function is {%abhimāna%} or self-consciousness; and in
the Yoga and Vedānta {%manas%} is connected with both
these and a fourth, viz. {%citta,%} the organ of thinking,
whose operation is said to be {%anu-sandhāna,%} in-
vestigation; in the Sāṅkhya {%manas%} is, as it were,
a portion or modification of {%buddhi,%} which is there
called {%mahat%} as the ‘great’ source of the other in-
ternal instruments {%ahaṅkāra%} and {%manas;%} in the
Vedānta {%manas,%} whose operation is judging and
doubting, is specially associated with {%buddhi,%} whose
function is said to be {%niścaya%} or ascertainment, these
two being held to include under them {%ahaṅkāra%} and
{%citta,%} and all four together constituting the whole
{%antaḥ-karaṇa%} or internal instrument; in the Atharva-
veda XIX. 9, 5, {%manas%} is enumerated after the five
senses as a sixth; in the Ṛg-veda it is sometimes
joined with {%hṛd%} or {%hṛdaya,%} the heart, cf. IV. 37,
2, X. 10, 13; in Manu VII. 6. with {%cakṣus,%} the
