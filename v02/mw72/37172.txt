{%Mārkaṇḍeya, as,%}¦ m. a patronymic from Mṛ-
kaṇḍu, (according to others also Mṛkaṇḍa); N. of
an ancient sage (the reputed author or narrator of
the Mārkaṇḍeya-Purāṇa); ({%ās%}), m. pl. the descend-
ants of Mārkaṇḍeya; ({%am%}), n. {%= mārkaṇḍeyasya%}
{%tīrtham; (as, ī, am),%} delivered or composed by
Mārkaṇḍeya. {%—Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa, am,%} n., N.
of one of the eighteen Purāṇas, (in this Purāṇa
Jaimini, the pupil of Vyāsa, applies to Mārkaṇḍeya
to be made acquainted with the nature of Vāsudeva
or Kṛṣṇa, and for an explanation of some of the
incidents of the Mahā-bhārata; the sage excuses
himself, and refers Jaimini to some sapient birds of
celestial origin, residing in the Vindhya mountains,
and profoundly versed in the Vedas; these birds,
whose chief is called Piṅgākṣa, answer Jaimini's
[Page0773-b+ 80]
questions and explain various difficult points, such as,
‘Why was Vāsudeva born a mortal? How was it
Draupadī became the wife of the five Pāṇḍus?’ &c.,
&c. The answer to these inquiries and the addition
of various legends constitute the bulk of this Purāṇa,
and make it a kind of supplement to the Mahā-
bhārata; it differs from all the other Purāṇas in its
narrative rather than sectarial character.)
