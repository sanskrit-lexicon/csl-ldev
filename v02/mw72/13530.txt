{%Katham%}¦ is often connected, like {%kim,%} with the
<div n="lb"/>particles {%cana, cid,%} and {%api,%} which give an inde-
<div n="lb"/>finite sense to the interrogative (e. g. {%kathaṃ cana,%}
<div n="lb"/>in no way, not at all). When not itself negative
<div n="lb"/>{%kathaṃ cana%} = in some way, some how; scarcely,
<div n="lb"/>with difficulty; {%na kathaṃ cana,%} in no way; {%ka-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%thañcit,%} some how or other, by some means or
<div n="lb"/>other, in any way, with some difficulty, scarcely, in
<div n="lb"/>a moderate degree, a little; {%na kathañcit,%} not at all,
<div n="lb"/>in no way whatever; {%na kathañcid na,%} in no way
<div n="lb"/>not, i. e. most decidedly; {%yathā kathañcit,%} in any
<div n="lb"/>way whatsoever; {%kathañcid yadi jīvati,%} it is with
<div n="lb"/>difficulty that he lives; {%katham api,%} some how or
<div n="lb"/>other, with some difficulty, scarcely, a little; {%katham%}
<div n="lb"/>{%api na,%} by no means, not at all. In addition to
<div n="lb"/>the above senses lexicographers assert that {%katham%}
<div n="lb"/>may imply ‘amazement, surprise, pleasure, abuse;’
<div n="lb"/>[with {%katham%} cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">κατά.</lang>]
<div n="P"/>At the beginning of an adjective compound {%katham%}
<div n="lb"/>may have the same sense as {%kim%}. {%—Kathaṃ-rūpa,%}

<div n="lb"/>{%ā, am,%} of what power? {%—Kathaṅ-kathika, as,%}
