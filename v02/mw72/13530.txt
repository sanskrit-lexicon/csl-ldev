{%Katham%}¦ is often connected, like {%kim,%} with the
particles {%cana, cid,%} and {%api,%} which give an inde-
finite sense to the interrogative (e. g. {%kathaṃ cana,%}
in no way, not at all). When not itself negative
{%kathaṃ cana%} = in some way, some how; scarcely,
with difficulty; {%na kathaṃ cana,%} in no way; {%ka-%}
{%thañcit,%} some how or other, by some means or
other, in any way, with some difficulty, scarcely, in
a moderate degree, a little; {%na kathañcit,%} not at all,
in no way whatever; {%na kathañcid na,%} in no way
not, i. e. most decidedly; {%yathā kathañcit,%} in any
way whatsoever; {%kathañcid yadi jīvati,%} it is with
difficulty that he lives; {%katham api,%} some how or
other, with some difficulty, scarcely, a little; {%katham%}
{%api na,%} by no means, not at all. In addition to
the above senses lexicographers assert that {%katham%}
may imply ‘amazement, surprise, pleasure, abuse;’
[with {%katham%} cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">κατά.</lang>]
