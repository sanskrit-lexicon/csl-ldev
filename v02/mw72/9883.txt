{#इति#} 2¦. {%iti,%} ind. (fr. pronominal base 3. {%i%}),
<div n="lb"/>in this manner, thus. In its original signification {%iti%}
<div n="lb"/>refers to something that has been said or thought, or
<div n="lb"/>lays stress on what precedes. In the Brāhmaṇas it is
<div n="lb"/>often equivalent to ‘as you know,’ reminding the
<div n="lb"/>hearer or reader of certain customs, conditions, &c.,
<div n="lb"/>supposed to be known to him.
[Page0139-a+ 75]
<div n="P"/>In quotations of every kind {%iti%} means that the pre-
<div n="lb"/>ceding words are the very words which some person
<div n="lb"/>has or might have spoken, and placed thus at the end
<div n="lb"/>of a speech it serves the purpose of inverted commas
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%ity uktvā,%} having so said; {%iti kṛtvā,%} having so
<div n="lb"/>considered, having so decided). It may often have
<div n="lb"/>reference merely to what is passing in the mind, e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%bālo'pi nāvamantavyo manuṣya iti bhūmipaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>a king, though a child, is not to be despised, saying
<div n="lb"/>to one's self, ‘he is a mortal,’ (Gram. 928.) In
<div n="lb"/>theatrical language {%iti tathā karoti%} = after these
<div n="lb"/>words he acts so.
<div n="P"/>Sometimes {%iti%} is used to include under one head
<div n="lb"/>a number of separate objects aggregated together
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%ijyādhyayanadānāni tapaḥ satyaṃ kṣamā%}
<div n="lb"/>{%damaḥ alobha iti mārgo'yam,%} ‘sacrificing, study-
<div n="lb"/>ing, liberality, penance, truth, patience, self-restraint,
<div n="lb"/>absence of desire,’ this course of conduct, &c.).
