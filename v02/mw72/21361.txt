{%—Taittirīya-saṃhitā,%} f. the collection of the

the more ancient version of the Yajur-veda, was
called Taittirīya, as, handed, down by Tittiri, the
pupil of Yāska, the pupil of Vaiśampāyana; the more
modern or bright Yajur-veda being attributed to
Yājñavalkya, of the family of the Vājasaneyins: the
legend relates that the Yajus in its original form
was first taught by the sage Vaiśampāyana to twenty-
seven pupils, Yājñavalkya being deputed by him to
teach it to others; subsequently the sage being
offended with Yājñavalkya, bade him relinquish the
Veda committed to him, which he instantly disgorged
in a tangible form; whereupon the other disciples of
Vaiśampāyana receiving his command to pick it up,
assumed the form of partridges for that purpose, and
swallowed the texts, which were soiled, and hence
named ‘black,’ the other name {%taittirīya%} having
reference to the partridges. Yājñavalkya then had
recourse to the Sun, and from that deity received a
new revelation of the Yajus, which is sometimes
called ‘white,’ and sometimes from the patronymic
of Yājñavalkya, Vājasaneyin.) {%—Taittirīyāraṇyaka%}
