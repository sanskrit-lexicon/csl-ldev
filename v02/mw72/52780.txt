{#सोम#}¦ {%soma, as,%} m. (according to Uṇādi-s.
I. 139. fr. rt. 3. {%su,%} ‘to distil or extract or sprinkle,’
but connected by some with rt. 4. {%su,%} ‘to generate,’
the act of expressing the Soma juice being compared
to the act of begetting), a particular climbing plant,
Sarcostema Viminalis or Asclepias Acida (said to grow
abundantly on the mountains of India and Persia;
this celebrated plant, sometimes called ‘the moon-
plant’ and perhaps a kind of milk-weed, was for-
merly a most important ingredient in sacrificial offer-
ings, and is perpetually alluded to in Vedic literature
as well as in the Persian Avesta; it was collected by
moon-light on certain mountains [in Ṛg-veda X. 34,
1. the mountain Mūja-vat is mentioned], stripped of
its numerous leaves, and then carried to the place of
sacrifice; the stalks having been there crushed be-
tween stones by the priests were sprinkled with
water and placed on a sieve or strainer for purifica-
tion [see {%pāvamāna%}], whence, after further pressure,
the acid juice trickled into a vessel called Droṇa;
after which it was mixed with clarified butter, flour,
&c., made to ferment, and then offered in libations
to the gods or drunk by the Brāhmans, by both of
whom its exhilarating or intoxicating qualities were
supposed to be highly prized; it is sometimes de-
scribed as having been brought from the sky by a
Śyena or falcon, and guarded by the Gandharvas;
sometimes as having been brought by the Gāyatrī in
the form of a bird, or by the daughter of the Sun,
from a spot where it had been nourished by the
rain-god Parjanya, who is represented in Ṛg-veda
IX. 82, 3. as its father, the god Soma being else-
where described as rejoicing in the society of the
waters; all the 114 hymns of the ninth Maṇḍala of
[Page1137-a+ 81]
the Ṛg-veda, besides many others throughout this
Veda and the whole Sāma-veda, are devoted to the
praise of this plant, the use of which seems now to
be little known, though in some parts of India
Soma sacrifices are still offered; for the connection
between the Soma ceremonies and the Sāma-veda
see {%sāma-veda;%} this Veda distinguishes two kinds
of Soma, one said to be green and the other yellow,
but the golden-coloured is described as most cele-
brated; the more modern Su-śruta, q. v., on the
other hand, distinguishes twenty-four varieties of the
Soma plant); the intoxicating and invigorating juice
of the above plant (which, in the Vedic period, was
regarded as a kind of Amṛta or nectar, conferring
eternal life and vigour on the drinkers of it, whether
gods or men, and was offered to the gods to pro-
pitiate them and make them accede to the petitions
of their worshippers, see above); the above plant or
its juice personified (and constantly deified in the Veda,
and in its character of a god represented as primeval,
all-powerful, all-pervading, healing all diseases, lord of
all other gods, and identified with the very supreme
Being himself; this worship of Soma by the Hindūs
of the Vedic age is thought to possess great
community of character with that of Dionysus and
Bacchus by the Greeks and Romans; Soma is
regarded as the author of Ṛg-veda X. 124, 1, 5 — 9);
nectar, the beverage of the gods; water; the moon
or its deity (to whom the name Soma, which first
belonged to the plant only, came to be applied in
Post-vedic mythology, traces of this application being
also observable in Ṛg-veda X. 85, in Atharva-veda
XI. 6, 7, and in several passages of the Śatapatha-
Brāhmaṇa; in the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa I. 22, Brahmā is
said to have appointed Soma or the moon to be the
‘monarch of planets, of plants, of sacrifices, and
penances,’ and one of the names of the moon is
Oṣadhi-pati or Oṣadhīśa, ‘lord of herbs;’ again,
at the churning of the ocean, as described in the
Purāṇas, after all sorts of medicinal plants and heal-
ing herbs &c. are thrown in, three of the precious
things said to be produced are Soma, ‘the moon,’
Amṛta, ‘nectar,’ and Surā, ‘spirituous liquor,’ and
in other legends this nectar is said to be preserved in
the body of the moon; in Manu V. 96, Soma is
called one of the eight Loka-pālas or guardians of
the world); a ray of light ({%= dīdhiti,%} according
to Śabda-k.); air, wind; camphor; a particular
drug of supposed magical properties; a particular
mountain or mountainous range, (according to some)
the mountains of the moon; a particular class of

moon propitiated Śiva by performing great austerities
on the spot, whereupon Śiva granted him a boon,
and Soma in return set up a Liṅga on the place
where he had done penance; the temple built there
was so famed for its splendor and enormous wealth
