{#ग्ना#}¦ {%gnā,%} f. (generally used in plur., but
according to some in Ṛg-veda IV. 9, 4, the nom.
sing. {%gnās%} occurs; the word seems to be derived
from {%jñā%} rather than from {%jan,%} and to mean originally
‘a wise female.’ In the Nighaṇṭavas it is enumerated
among the synonyms of {%vāc,%} ‘the voice.’ By Yāska
[Page0302-a+ 80]
in Nirukta III. 21. it is said to be derived from
{%gam,%} ‘to approach,’ and to mean ‘a female or
woman’ in general), Ved. a semi-divine or super-
human female, a kind of goddess or female genius;
a woman. {%—Gnā-vat, ān, atī, at,%} Ved. (Sāy.) ac-
companied by women or wives. According to some
the neut. may be {%gnā-vas;%} but Sāy. in Ṛg-veda II.
1, 5, considers {%gnāvas%} a nom. pl., and interprets it to
mean ‘words of praise.’ {%—Gnās-pati, is,%} m., Ved.
the husband of divine wives, or of a divine wife;
(perhaps {%gnās%} is here a shortened genitive.) {%—Gnās-%}
{%patnī,%} f. a divine wife, the wife of a deity; (Sāy.)
a kind of female genius protecting women; (perhaps
{%gnās%} is here the nominative in apposition to {%patnī,%}
i. e. a divine female who is a wife.)
