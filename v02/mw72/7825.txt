{#आ#} 3¦. {%ā%} a prefix to verbs and nouns, (ex-
<div n="lb"/>pressing) near, near to, towards, from all sides, all
<div n="lb"/>around; and sometimes redundant. As a prefix to verbs
<div n="lb"/>of motion it expresses the notion of moving or going
<div n="lb"/>towards; e. g. {%ā-krāmati,%} he goes towards. When
<div n="lb"/>prefixed to roots like {%gam, yā,%} and {%i,%} to go, and {%dā,%}
<div n="lb"/>to give, it reverses the action; e. g. {%ā-gacchati,%} he
<div n="lb"/>comes; {%ā-datte,%} he takes.
<div n="P"/>As unconnected with verbs and prefixed to nouns it
<div n="lb"/>forms with them either compound adverbs or adjectives,
<div n="lb"/>implying the limit conclusive (until, unto, as far as),
[Page0110-c+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>or the limit inceptive (from, from thence or that
<div n="lb"/>time); e. g. {%ā-maraṇam,%} till death; {%ā-kumāram,%}
<div n="lb"/>from childhood [cf. <nsi>a puero</nsi>]; {%ā-gopālā dvijātayaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>the twice-born including the cowherds.
<div n="P"/>(Prefixed to adjectives &c. it implies) diminution;
<div n="lb"/>e. g. {%ā-pāṇḍu,%} a little pale; {%ā-pakva,%} half-cooked.
<div n="P"/>(As a separable adverb {%ā%} implies) near, near to,
<div n="lb"/>towards; thereto, further, also, and; especially, even.
<div n="lb"/>In many places in the Vedas {%ā%} gives force to the
<div n="lb"/>word which precedes it (e. g. {%mahimā vām In-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%drāgnī paniṣṭha ā,%}  ‘your greatness, O Indra and
<div n="lb"/>Agni, is praiseworthy indeed’); and in a similar man-
<div n="lb"/>ner we find it in the Veda placed after prepositions,
<div n="lb"/>the sense of which is strengthened by it.
<div n="P"/>(As a separable preposition with acc. or abl.) near
<div n="lb"/>to, up to, to, as far as; e. g. {%śatam ā jātīs,%} as
<div n="lb"/>far as a hundred births; {%ā samudrāt,%} as far as the
<div n="lb"/>ocean: (with abl.) away from, from; out of, of, from
<div n="lb"/>among; e. g. {%ā mūlāt,%} from the beginning; {%bahubhya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ā,%} from among many: (with loc.) in, at; e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%dama ā,%} in a house.
