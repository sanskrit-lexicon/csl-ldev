{#ताथाभाव्य#}¦ {%tāthābhāvya, as, ā, am%} (fr. {%tathā-%}
{%bhāva%}), a N. for the Svarita accent at the end of the
first member of a compound when an Udātta syllable
immediately follows, (the low-sounding vowel in such
a position cannot strictly be called either Svarita or
Anudātta-tara, and a new name is therefore given
to it; this may often happen in the case of two
separate words, but the vowel is then called An-
udātta-tara.)
