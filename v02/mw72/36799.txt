{#मा#} 1¦. {%mā,%} ind. (causing a following {%ch%} to
be changed to {%cch,%} see Gram. 48. <nsi>c</nsi>), a particle of
prohibition and of negation, usually translatable by
‘not,’ or sometimes used as a conjunction and equi-
valent to ‘that — not, lest, would that — not;’ [cf.
the use of Gr. <lang n="greek">μή;</lang> Lat. <nsi>ne.</nsi>] {%Mā%} is most com-
monly employed in prohibition or deprecation, when
it may be joined with the imperative (e. g. {%mā%}
{%brūhi,%} speak not; {%mā lajjasva,%} be not ashamed;
{%maivaṃ vada,%} speak not thus); often also with the
aorist, especially in later Sanskrit, when the augment
is generally dropped (e. g. {%mā kṛthāḥ,%} do not
make; {%mā tyākṣīḥ,%} do not abandon; {%mā śucaḥ,%}
grieve not; {%mā bhaiṣīḥ,%} fear not; {%mā nīnaśaḥ,%}
destroy not; {%vyathām mānubhūḥ,%} feel not pain;
or with the sense ‘lest,’ as in Manu VIII. 15,
{%dharmo na hantavyo mā no dharmo hato va-%}
{%dhīt,%} justice must not be destroyed, lest justice being
destroyed destroy us); often with addition of the par-
ticle {%sma%} (e. g. {%mā sma vādīḥ,%} speak not; {%mā sma %}
[Page0764-b+ 80]
{%gamaḥ,%} go not); sometimes with the imperfect,
the augment being still cut off (e. g. {%mā sma%}
{%bhavat,%} may he not become; {%mā sma karot,%} let
him not do; {%mainam abhibhāṣathāḥ,%} do not
speak to him, cf. Pāṇ. VI. 4, 74); occasionally, in
epic poetry &c., with an aorist, without elision of
the augment (e. g. {%mā kālas tvām aty-agāt,%} let
not the season pass by thee; {%śraddhā no mā vy-%}
{%agamat,%} may faith not depart from us); not unfre-
quently with the potential, in the sense of ‘wishing
that anything may not happen’ (e. g. {%mā sma%}
{%janayet putram īdṛśam,%} may she not bring forth
such a son! {%mā Yamam paśyeyam,%} may I not see
Yama! {%mā kūryād akāryam,%} O that he may do
nothing wrong!); and even with the precative (e. g.
{%mā bhūyāt,%} may it not be!); more rarely with the
potential, in the sense of ‘prohibition’ (e. g. {%mā%}
{%smainam pratyudīkṣethāḥ,%} do not look at him);
sometimes with the future, in the sense of ‘lest,
that — not’ (e. g. {%mā tvāṃ śapsye,%} lest I curse thee,
that I may not curse thee); even with the fut. pass.
part. ({%maivam prārthyam,%} it must not be so re-
quested); and even with the pres. part. (e. g. {%mā%}
{%jīvan yo duḥkha-dagdho jīvati,%} he ought not
[to be] living who lives consumed by pain); some-
times {%mā%} takes the place of the simple negative {%na%}
(e. g. {%gaccha vā mā vā,%} you can go or not go;
{%mā jetavyaḥ,%} he is not to be conquered; {%mā gan-%}
{%tum arhasi,%} thou oughtest not to go; {%katham mā%}
{%bhūt,%} how may it not be); occasionally without a
verb, which must be supplied from the context (e. g.
{%mā śabdam,%} i. e. with ellipsis of {%kuruta,%} do not
make a noise; {%mā nāma rakṣiṇaḥ,%} may it not
be the watchmen ! {%maivam%} or {%mā tāvat,%} not so,
i. e. let it not be so; or with {%mā%} repeated, thus
{%mā mā, mā maivam%}). In the Veda {%mā%} is some-
times followed by the particle {%u,%} blending with it
into {%mo%} (e. g. Ṛg-veda V. 65, 6, {%mā maghonaḥ%}
{%pari khyatam mo asmākam [putrān],%} deny us
not who are rich in offerings, nor indeed our sons
[according to Sāy. {%mo = maiva%}]; and Ṛg-veda 1.
38, 6, {%mo ṣu vadhīt%} [Sāy. {%= sarvathā vadham%}
{%mā kārṣīt%}], let him not on any account destroy);
[cf. Zend and Old Pers. <nsi>mā;</nsi> Gr. <lang n="greek">μή;</lang> perhaps Lat.
<nsi>ne.</nsi>] {%—Mā-cira, as, ā, am,%} not long, short; ({%am%}),
ind. without delay, shortly, quickly (generally after
an impv. or before an aor. without augment, and
sometimes for {%na-ciram,%} e. g. {%gaccha mā-ciram%}
or {%mā-ciraṃ gamaḥ,%} go without delay; {%vrajiṣ-%}
{%yāmi mā-ciram,%} I will set forth without delay).
{%—Mā-vilambam%} or {%mā-vilambitam,%} ind. without
delay, shortly, quickly.
