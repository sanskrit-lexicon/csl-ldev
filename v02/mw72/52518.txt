{%Sūtra, am,%}¦ n. (fr. rt. {%siv,%} ‘to sew;’ but said to
<div n="lb"/>be connected with rt. {%sūtr%} above), a thread, string,
<div n="lb"/>line, cord; fibre, wire; a collection of threads; the
<div n="lb"/>sacred thread or cord worn by the first three classes,
<div n="lb"/>(see {%yajñopavīta,%} p. 804); the string or wire of a
<div n="lb"/>puppet or doll; a short rule or precept, axiom,
<div n="lb"/>aphorism (in morals, religion, or science; {%iti sū-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%treṇa,%} according to such an aphorism); a short and
<div n="lb"/>technical sentence or metrical line used as a memorial
<div n="lb"/>rule to aid in the acquirement of any system (and
<div n="lb"/>hence generally expressed in brief and obscure and
<div n="lb"/>sometimes symbolical language, intelligible only to
<div n="lb"/>those who possess the key to its interpretation, this
<div n="lb"/>key being sometimes given in separate Sūtras called
<div n="lb"/>Paribhāṣās, and the right understanding of a whole
<div n="lb"/>series or chain of rules depending on a knowledge of
<div n="lb"/>the Adhikāra or heading-rule and its influence [{%anu-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vṛtti%}] on those that follow; these short sentences
<div n="lb"/>and aphoristic rules, the use of which constitutes a
<div n="lb"/>most curious feature in the literary history of the
<div n="lb"/>Hindūs, appear to have been often mere aids to the
<div n="lb"/>memory of teachers — mere hints to guide lecturers in
<div n="lb"/>their oral explications; they were also especially
<div n="lb"/>useful in this way to the priests who had the
<div n="lb"/>management of a complicated ritual); any work or
<div n="lb"/>manual consisting of strings or long lines of the
<div n="lb"/>above aphoristic rules and sentences hanging toge-
<div n="lb"/>ther like threads, (though the term {%sūtra%} may
<div n="lb"/>possibly indicate not so much a line or series of
<div n="lb"/>rules as rules written on leaves which were kept
<div n="lb"/>together by strings; these Sūtra works form a sort
<div n="lb"/>of groundwork or foundation of teaching, not only
<div n="lb"/>in all religious ritual, but in philosophy, in grammar,
<div n="lb"/>and in the collateral subjects of accent, euphony,
<div n="lb"/>etymology, and prosody: thus in religion and ritual
<div n="lb"/>there are first the Śrauta-sūtras, and among them
<div n="lb"/>principally the Kalpa-sūtras, founded directly on
<div n="lb"/>Śruti, q. v., and treating especially of ritual; they
<div n="lb"/>form a kind of rubric or directory to Vedic cere-
<div n="lb"/>monial, or in other words, a complete systema-
<div n="lb"/>tized guide to the rambling discursive Brāhmaṇa as
<div n="lb"/>distinct from the Mantra portion of the Veda [see
<div n="lb"/>{%brāhmaṇa%}], giving concise rules for the perform-
<div n="lb"/>ance of every kind of sacrifice; there are Sūtras of
<div n="lb"/>this kind by Āśvalāyana and Śāṅkhāyana for the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛg-veda; by Kātyāyana for the White Yajur-veda;
<div n="lb"/>by Āpastamba, Baudhāyana, and the Mānavas for
<div n="lb"/>the Black Yajur-veda; by Lāṭyāyana, Drāhyāyaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Maśaka, and Gobhila for the Sāma-veda; and by
<div n="lb"/>Kuśika for the Atharva-veda; there are also two
<div n="lb"/>other kinds of Sūtras connected with ceremonial,
<div n="lb"/>viz. the Grihya-sūtras and Sāmayācārika or Dharma-
<div n="lb"/>sūtras [often by the same authors, with special refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence also to each separate Veda, and even placed by
<div n="lb"/>some, like the Kalpa, under the head of Sūtras
<div n="lb"/>founded on Śruti], which are really ‘rules for domestic
<div n="lb"/>ceremonies and conventional customs,’ and are some-
<div n="lb"/>times called collectively Smārta-sūtras [as founded
<div n="lb"/>on {%smṛti%} or ‘tradition,’ see {%smārta%}]; these led to
<div n="lb"/>the later Dharma-śāstras or ‘law-books’ attributed
<div n="lb"/>to Manu, Yājñavalkya, Parāśara, &c., the names of
<div n="lb"/>the authors of the Sūtras and of the law-books being
<div n="lb"/>often identical; in philosophy each system has its
<div n="lb"/>regular text-book of aphorisms written in Sūtras by
<div n="lb"/>its supposed founder, see {%vedānta-sūtra, nyāya-s°, %}

<div n="lb"/>{%sāṅkhya-s°, mīmāṃsā-s°, vaiśeṣika-s°, yoga-s°;%}
<div n="lb"/>in Vyākaraṇa or grammar there are the celebrated
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras of Pāṇini in eight books, which are the
<div n="lb"/>groundwork of a vast grammatical literature, besides
<div n="lb"/>the Uṇādi-sūtras on certain affixes; in Vedic accent
<div n="lb"/>and phonetics there are the Prātiśākhyas [see {%prāti-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śākhya%}] and the Phiṭ-sūtras of Śāntanava; in
<div n="lb"/>etymology there are strings of Vedic words, and
<div n="lb"/>in prosody there are the Sūtras of Piṅgala-nāga on
<div n="lb"/>Chandas, including both Vedic and non-Vedic
<div n="lb"/>metres, and the Nidāna-sūtra on the metres of the
<div n="lb"/>Sāma-veda and Vedic metres generally: it should be
<div n="lb"/>borne in mind that the mixture of Ślokas in some
<div n="lb"/>of the Prātiśākhyas and in some more recent Sūtra
<div n="lb"/>works, though depriving them of the brevity strictly
<div n="lb"/>necessary to constitute Sūtras, does not prevent their
<div n="lb"/>being regarded as collections of aphoristic and me-
<div n="lb"/>morial rules: with regard to grammatical Sūtras it is
<div n="lb"/>necessary to remember that all connecting words
<div n="lb"/>used as prepositions, however necessary to the sense,
<div n="lb"/>are omitted; thus, a word in the genitive case re-
<div n="lb"/>quires {%sthāne,%} ‘instead of,’ to be supplied; a word in
<div n="lb"/>the ablative requires {%param,%} ‘after;’ a word in the
<div n="lb"/>instrumental requires {%saha,%} ‘together with;’ a word
<div n="lb"/>in the locative, though sometimes to be translated
<div n="lb"/>in the ordinary way by prefixing ‘in,’ may often be
<div n="lb"/>used as a locative absolute, and {%pare%} must then be
<div n="lb"/>supplied, the sense being ‘on such an affix or word
<div n="lb"/>coming after or following;’ the word {%vā%} is equivalent
<div n="lb"/>to ‘optionally’ or ‘alternative’); any rule, law, canon,
<div n="lb"/>decree (in law &c.). {%—Sūtra-kaṇṭha, as,%} m. ‘hav-
<div n="lb"/>ing Sūtras in the throat or mouth ready to be
<div n="lb"/>repeated,’ a Brāhman; ‘having lines on the throat,’
