{%Trita, as,%}¦ m., Ved. (in the Atharva-veda also
<div n="lb"/>{%tṛta%}), N. of a Vedic deity; (he is generally asso-
<div n="lb"/>ciated with the Maruts, Vāyu, and Indra; and fights
<div n="lb"/>like the latter with Tvāṣṭra, Vṛtra, and other
<div n="lb"/>demons: he is also called Āptya, q. v., either as
<div n="lb"/>produced in water by Agni, whence he is sometimes
<div n="lb"/>called ‘a son of the water,’ or as son of the Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>Āpta. In some passages of the Taittirīya-Saṃhitā he
<div n="lb"/>is regarded as bestowing long life; while elsewhere
<div n="lb"/>he is supposed to reside in the remotest regions of
<div n="lb"/>the world, whence the idea of wishing to remove
<div n="lb"/>calamity to Trita or to the remotest place possible;
<div n="lb"/>cf. Ṛg-veda VIII. 47, 14. In some passages of the
[Page0393-a+ 72]
<div n="lb"/>Veda, Indian commentators explain Trita by {%tri-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%sthāna,%} ‘reaching through the triple world,’ as an
<div n="lb"/>epithet of Indra or Vāyu. In later myths Trita is
<div n="lb"/>described as a Ṛṣi, by whom several hymns of the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛg-veda were-composed. Sāyaṇa in his introduction
<div n="lb"/>to Ṛg-veda I. 105, relates that there were three Ṛṣis,
<div n="lb"/>named Ekata, Dvita, and Trita, who lived in a desert
<div n="lb"/>country; being parched with thirst, they looked
<div n="lb"/>about for a well, and having found one, Trita entered
<div n="lb"/>it to draw water, when the other two, desirous of
<div n="lb"/>obtaining his property, threw him into the well and
<div n="lb"/>closed up the mouth with a wheel; shut up in the
<div n="lb"/>well, Trita composed a hymn to the gods, and
<div n="lb"/>managed, in a marvellous manner, to perform the
<div n="lb"/>Soma sacrifice, that he might drink the Soma himself
<div n="lb"/>before death, or offer it to the deities in the hope of
<div n="lb"/>being extricated by them: his preparation of the
<div n="lb"/>Soma is described in the Mahā-bh. Śalya-parva 2095,
<div n="lb"/>and he is elsewhere celebrated as an offerer of the
<div n="lb"/>Soma. In various other epic legends, Ekata, Dvita,
<div n="lb"/>and Trita are described as three brothers, sons of
<div n="lb"/>Gautama or of Prajā-pati, = Brahmā. According to
<div n="lb"/>the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa, Trita is one of the twelve
<div n="lb"/>sons of Manu and Naḍvalā. Some identify the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>{%Trita%} with the Vedic {%Traitana,%} and with <nsi>Thraetana</nsi>
<div n="lb"/>the Zend form of <nsi>Feridun.</nsi> His connection with
<div n="lb"/>water points to a comparison with the Gr. <lang n="greek">Τρίτων,</lang>
<div n="lb"/><lang n="greek">τριτο-γενής, Τριτωνίς, Τριτο-πάτορες,</lang> &c.) ({%Trita%}
<div n="lb"/>seems also to mean) a class of deities, ‘the third
<div n="lb"/>ones,’ i. e. those who live in the sky (?); the priest
<div n="lb"/>who prepares the Soma.
