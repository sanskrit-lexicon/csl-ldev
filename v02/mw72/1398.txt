{%Adhvaryu, us,%}¦ m. one who institutes an Adhvara;
any officiating priest; technical name of a priest of a
particular class (as distinguished from the {%Hotṛ,%} the
{%Udgātṛ,%} and the <nsi>Brahman</nsi> classes). The Adhvarya-
vas “had to measure the ground, to build the altar,
to prepare the sacrificial vessels, to fetch wood and
water, to light the fire, to bring the animal and
immolate it.” Whilst engaged in these duties, they
had to repeat, without interruption or mistake, the
hymns of the Yajur-veda; hence that Veda itself is also
called Adhvaryu or Adhvaryavas, and the latter word
also means adherents of the Yajur-veda. {%—Adhvaryu-%}
{%kāṇḍa, am,%} n. title of a book of mantras or prayers
intended for Adhvaryavas. {%—Adhvaryu-kratu, us,%}
m. sacrificial act performed by the Adhvaryu.
