{%Rāvaṇa, as, ī, am%}¦ (fr. the Caus.), screaming, roar-
ing, crying, bellowing, bewailing, making lamentation;
[Page0844-b+ 77]
({%as%}), m. ‘the Vociferator,’ N. of the ruler of Laṅkā
or Ceylon and the famous chief of the Rākṣasas or
demons whose subjugation and destruction by Rāma-
candra, the seventh incarnation of Viṣṇu, form the
subject of the Rāmāyaṇa, (as son of Viśravas, he was
younger brother of Kuvera, but by a different mother,
Ilavilā being the mother of Kuvera, and Keśinī of
the three other brothers, Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, and
Kumbha-karṇa; both Rāvaṇa and Kuvera, the god
of wealth, are often called Paulastya, as grandchildren
of the Ṛṣi Pulastya, one of the seven or ten mind-
born sons of Brahmā, and as Kuvera is king of the
Yakṣas, so is Rāvaṇa of the Rākṣasas, the latter,
however, are always malignant beings [see {%rākṣasa%}],
and Rāvaṇa himself is one of the worst of the many
impersonations of evil common in Hindū mythology;
he is the Satan of the Rāmāyaṇa as Duryodhana is
of the Mahā-bhārata; he has ten heads [whence his
names Daśa-grīva, Daśānana, &c.] and twenty arms,
symbolizing strength; his power is described as so
great, that where he is ‘there the sun does not give
out its heat, the winds through fear of him do not
blow, the fire ceases to burn, and the ocean becomes
motionless;’ he even, by his power, defeated his own
brother Vaiśravaṇa or Kuvera, and carried off his self-
moving car, called Puṣpaka, the wonders of which
are described in the Rāmāyaṇa; this potency was,
as usual, acquired by self-inflicted austerities, which
had obtained from Brahmā a boon, in virtue of which
Rāvaṇa was invulnerable by gods and divine beings
of all kinds, though not by men or a god in human
form; as Viṣṇu became incarnate in Rāma-candra
to destroy Rāvaṇa, so other gods produced innume-
rable monkeys, bears, and various semi-divine animals
to do battle with the legions of demons, his subjects,
under Khara, Dūṣaṇa, and his other generals; see
{%hanu-mat%}); a patronymic from Ravaṇa; N. of the
author of a commentary on the Sāma-veda; of one
on the Ṛg-veda; of the author of the Arka-cikitsā;
of a king of Kaśmīra (mentioned together with Indra-
jit and Vibhīṣaṇa); ({%am%}), n. the act of screaming,
&c.; N. of a Muhūrta. {%—Rāvaṇa-gaṅgā,%} f. ‘Rā-
vaṇa's Ganges,’ N. of a river in Laṅkā (called after
the Rākṣasa Rāvaṇa). {%—Rāvaṇa-hasra,%} a parti-
cular stringed instrument. {%—Rāvaṇa-hrada, as,%} m.,
N. of a lake (from which the Śata-dru or Sutlej
takes its rise). {%—Rāvaṇāri (°ṇa-ari), is,%} m. Rā-
vaṇa's enemy, i. e. Rāma.
