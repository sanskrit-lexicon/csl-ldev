{#कतम#}¦ {%katama, as, ā, at%} (superlative of 2. {%ka;%}
<div n="lb"/>declined as a pronom., Gram. 236), who or which of
<div n="lb"/>many ? (e. g. {%katamena pathā yātās te,%} by which
<div n="lb"/>road have they gone?). {%Katama%} is often a mere
<div n="lb"/>strengthened substitute for {%ka,%} the superlative affix
<div n="lb"/>imparting emphasis. Hence it may occasionally be
<div n="lb"/>used for ‘who or which of two?’ (e. g. {%tayoḥ kata-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%masmai,%} to which of these two ?). It may option-
<div n="lb"/>ally be compounded with the word to which it refers
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%katamaḥ Kaṭhaḥ%} or {%katama-kaṭhaḥ,%} which
<div n="lb"/>Kaṭha out of many?). When followed by {%ca%} and
<div n="lb"/>preceded by {%yatama%} an indefinite expression is
<div n="lb"/>formed equivalent to ‘any whosoever,’ ‘any whatso-
<div n="lb"/>ever,’ &c. (e. g. {%yatamad eva katamac ca vidyāt,%}
<div n="lb"/>he may know anything whatsoever). In negative
<div n="lb"/>sentences {%katama%} with {%cana%} or {%katama%} with {%api%}
<div n="lb"/>= not even one, none at all (e. g. {%na katamac-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%canāhaḥ,%} not even on a single day, on no day at
<div n="lb"/>all). In addition to the above uses {%katama%} is said to
<div n="lb"/>mean ‘best,’ ‘excessively good-looking;’ [cf. 3. {%ka.%}]
<div n="lb"/>{%—Katamoraga (°ma-ur°), as,%} m., N. of a man.
