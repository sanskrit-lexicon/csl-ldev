{%Upa-sarjana, am,%}¦ n. pouring on; misfortune,
inauspicious phenomenon, portent, eclipse; passing
by, leaving, eclipsing; any person or thing subordi-
nate or subsidiary to another, a substitute, a repre-
sentative; (in gram.) a word which by composition
or derivation loses its original independance, while
it also determines the sense of another word; for
instance, in the derivative {%Aupiśala,%} a pupil of Api-
śali, {%Apiśali%} has become the {%upasarjana;%} so also in
the compound {%rāja-puruṣa%} (fr. {%rājan%} and {%puruṣa%})
the first loses its independant character when com-
pounded and is therefore the {%upasarjana; (ī),%} f.
an infusion.
