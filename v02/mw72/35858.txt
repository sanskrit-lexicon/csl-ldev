{#भोस्#}¦ {%bhos%} (contracted fr. {%bhavas%} for {%bha-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%van,%} Sir! voc. sing. of 2. {%bhavat,%} q. v.; cf. {%bhagos%}
<div n="lb"/>under {%bhaga-vat,%} p. 696, col. 1), an interjection or
<div n="lb"/>vocative particle commonly used in addressing another
<div n="lb"/>person and generally translateable by ‘O!’ ‘Ho!’
<div n="lb"/>‘there!’ ‘Hallo!’ ‘Ah!’ ‘Alas!’ (before vowels and
<div n="lb"/>soft consonants {%bhos,%} like {%bhagos%} and {%aghos,%} is said
<div n="lb"/>to drop the final {%s,%} but before vowels {%bhoy%} is also
<div n="lb"/>allowed, see Pāṇ. VIII. 3, 17, 18, 20, 22, Vopa-
<div n="lb"/>deva II. 49, 50; before hard consonants, {%bhos%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%bhoḥ%} is the form required, and {%bhoḥ%} before a
<div n="lb"/>pause, but in the later literature {%bho%} is sometimes
<div n="lb"/>used where {%bhos%} or {%bhoḥ%} would be more correct;
<div n="lb"/>in Kathā-sarit-sāgara XVIII. 211, {%bhor iti%} is against
<div n="lb"/>the rule; in Hari-vaṃśa 8301 {%bhos%} occurs in the middle
<div n="lb"/>of a sentence, and in Bhāgavata-Purāṇa III. 23, 2,
<div n="lb"/>redundantly at the end; it is sometimes repeated,
<div n="lb"/>e. g. {%bho bho rājan%} in Śakuntalā, p. 12; according
<div n="lb"/>to lexicographers it may be used as an interjection
<div n="lb"/>of sorrow and of interrogation.)
