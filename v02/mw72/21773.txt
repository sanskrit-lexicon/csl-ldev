of an Āditya; a creative power associated with
Aditi, and therefore sometimes identified with Prajā-
pati; (his daughter is called Kṛttikā: in the Post-
vedic literature Dakṣa is the subject of numerous
legends, which relate his history differently; he is
there generally called the son of Brahmā, and placed
among the Prajā-patis or at their head as ‘the lord
of all creatures,’ being born from Brahmā's right
thumb, as his wife was from the left, see Manu IX.
128: in other legends he is said to be the son of
the ten Pra-cetasas or of Pra-cetas alone, whence his
patronymic Prācetasa; he is variously stated to have
had fifty, sixty, forty-four, and a less number of
daughters, of whom twenty-seven became the wives
of the Moon, forming the lunar asterisms, and thir-
teen or, according to others, seventeen or only eight
the wives of Kaśyapa, becoming by this latter the
mothers of gods, demons, men, and animals: Dakṣa
on one occasion celebrated a great sacrifice to obtain
a son, but omitted to invite Śiva who, according to
one legend, was his son-in-law, (Śiva's wife being Satī,
a form of Durgā, daughter of Dakṣa); this irritated
the god, who interrupted the sacrifice and decapitated
his father-in-law, see {%dakṣādhvara-dhvaṃśa-kṛt:%}

Brahmā himself, and is even in one legend identified

ensued in which the gods and Ṛṣis took the part
of Dakṣa, but were wounded and dispersed: Dakṣa

Śiva at the prayer of the gods; the decapitated head,
