{#इव#}¦ {%iva,%} ind. (fr. pronominal base 3. {%i%}),
like, in the same manner as (in this sense {%= yathā,%}
and used correlatively to {%tathā%}); as it were (after a
metaphorical expression, e. g. {%pathā iva yantau,%}
on a path going as it were); in a certain manner, in
some measure, a little, perhaps (in qualification or
mitigation of a strong assertion); nearly, almost, about
(e. g. {%muhūrtam iva,%} almost an hour); so, just so,
just, exactly, indeed, very (especially after words
which involve some restriction, e. g. {%īṣad iva,%} just
a little; {%kiñcid iva,%} just a little bit: and after a nega-
tion, e. g. {%nacirād iva,%} very soon). {%Iva%} is connected
vaguely, and somewhat pleonastically, with an inter-
rogative pronoun or adverb (e. g. {%kim iva,%} what ?
{%katham iva,%} how could that possibly be ? {%kveva,%}
where, I should like to know ?). In the Pada texts
of the Ṛg, Yajur, and Atharva-veda, and by native
grammarians, {%iva%} is considered to be compounded
with the word after which it stands, and is therefore
enclitic.
