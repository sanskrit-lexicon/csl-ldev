{%Kim%}¦ is much used as a particle of interrogation like
the Lat. <nsi>num, an,</nsi> sometimes translateable by ‘whe-
ther?’ but oftener serving only like a note of interro-
gation to mark a question (e. g. {%kiṃ vyādhā vane%}
{%'smin sañcaranti,%} do hunters roam about in this
wood ? In an interrogation the verb if uncom-
pounded with a preposition generally retains its accent
after {%kim%}). To this sense may be referred the {%kim%}
expressing blame, deficiency, &c., at the beginning
of compounds (e. g. {%kiṃ-rājan,%} what sort of a king?
i. e. a bad king); also the {%kim%} prefixed to verbs
with a similar meaning (e. g. {%kim-adhīte,%} he reads
badly). {%Kim — uta%} or {%kim — utavā%} or {%kim — %}
{%uta — uta%} or {%kim — athavā — uta,%} whether — or — 
or; [cf. {%uta.%}]
