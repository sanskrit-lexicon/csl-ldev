{%Vidura, as, ā, am,%}¦ knowing, wise, intelligent;
({%as%}), m. a learned or clever man; an intriguer; N.
of the younger brother of Dhṛta-rāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu,
(they were all three sons of Vyāsa, but only the
latter two by the two widows of Vicitra-vīrya; when
Vyāsa wanted a third son, the elder widow sent him
one of her slave-girls, dressed in her own clothes,
and this girl became the mother of Vidura, who is
sometimes called Kṣattṛ as if he were the son of a
Kṣatriya man and Śūdra woman: Vidura is described
as {%sarva-buddhimatāṃ varaḥ,%} and is one of the
wisest characters in the Mahā-bhārata, always ready
with good advice both for his nephews, the Pāṇḍavas,
and for his brother Dhṛta-rāṣṭra.)
