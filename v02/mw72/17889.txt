{#घ#} 2¦. {%gha,%} ind. (a particle used to lay stress
<div n="lb"/>on a word), at least, surely, verily, indeed, (cor-
<div n="lb"/>responding to the Gr. <lang n="greek">γε.</lang>) This word occurs often
<div n="lb"/>in the Ṛg-veda, elsewhere rarely; the final vowel is
<div n="lb"/>generally lengthened in the Saṃhitā, but the original
<div n="lb"/>form given in the Pada-pāṭha is always {%gha;%} it is
<div n="lb"/>connected with other particles (as {%cid, uta, id%}), and
<div n="lb"/>appears often after pronouns at the beginning of a
<div n="lb"/>Pāda, after prepositions, and after the negative
<div n="lb"/>particle {%na.%} Frequently this particle occurs in the
<div n="lb"/>clause which depends on a conditional or relative
<div n="lb"/>sentence (e. g. {%ā ghā gamad yadi śravat,%} he will
<div n="lb"/>surely come when he hears).
