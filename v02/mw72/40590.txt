{%Lopa, as,%}¦ m. breaking, violation, fracture, mutila-
<div n="lb"/>tion, cutting off, destruction; robbing, plundering,
<div n="lb"/>stealing, deprivation, want, deficiency, loss, interrup-
<div n="lb"/>tion, intermission, omission, separation, disappear-
<div n="lb"/>ance, dropping or falling out, rejection, annulling,
<div n="lb"/>cancelling, erasure, grammatical elision, ({%lopa%} is the
<div n="lb"/>technical term for elision generally as distinguished
<div n="lb"/>from the terms {%lup, ślu, luk,%} which are only appli-
[Page0870-a+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>cable to affixes; when {%lopa%} of an affix takes place,
<div n="lb"/>a blank is substituted, which exerts the same influence
<div n="lb"/>on the base as the affix itself, but when either {%luk%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%lup%} or {%ślu%} of an affix is enjoined, then the affix is
<div n="lb"/>not only dropped but it is also inoperative on the
<div n="lb"/>base; thus in the 1st pl. of {%kati,%} where {%jas%} is said
<div n="lb"/>to be elided by {%luk,%} the change of the final of the
<div n="lb"/>base to Guṇa does not take place, i. e. both the affix
<div n="lb"/>and its effect on the base are abolished; moreover,
<div n="lb"/>{%lopa%} may refer only to the last letter of an affix,
<div n="lb"/>whereas by {%luk%} &c. the dropping of the whole affix
<div n="lb"/>is implied); ({%ā%}), f. {%= lopāmudrā%}. {%—Lopāpatti (°pa-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%āp°), is,%} f. the being cut off or elided, the being
<div n="lb"/>dropped. {%—Lopāmudrā (°pa-am°),%} f., N. of the
<div n="lb"/>reputed wife of Agastya (regarded as the authoress
<div n="lb"/>of Ṛg-veda I. 179, 4). {%—Lopāmudrā-pati, is,%} m.
<div n="lb"/>‘husband of Lopāmudrā,’ N. of the sage Agastya.
