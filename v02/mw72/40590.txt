tion, cutting off, destruction; robbing, plundering,

technical term for elision generally as distinguished
from the terms {%lup, ślu, luk,%} which are only appli-
[Page0870-a+ 80]
cable to affixes; when {%lopa%} of an affix takes place,
a blank is substituted, which exerts the same influence
on the base as the affix itself, but when either {%luk%} or
{%lup%} or {%ślu%} of an affix is enjoined, then the affix is
not only dropped but it is also inoperative on the
base; thus in the 1st pl. of {%kati,%} where {%jas%} is said
to be elided by {%luk,%} the change of the final of the
base to Guṇa does not take place, i. e. both the affix
and its effect on the base are abolished; moreover,
{%lopa%} may refer only to the last letter of an affix,
whereas by {%luk%} &c. the dropping of the whole affix
is implied); ({%ā%}), f. {%= lopāmudrā%}. {%—Lopāpatti (°pa-%}

dropped. {%—Lopāmudrā (°pa-am°),%} f., N. of the
