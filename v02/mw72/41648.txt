{%Vasiṣṭha, as,%}¦ m. (superl. of {%vasu%} or {%vasu-%}
{%mat;%} cf. {%vasīyas%}), ‘the most wealthy,’ N. of a very
celebrated Vedic Ṛṣi or inspired sage (owner of
the ‘cow of plenty,’ called Nandinī, offspring of
Surabhi, which by granting all desires made him, as
his name implies, master of every {%vasu%} or desirable
object; he was the typical representative of Brāh-
manical dignity, and the legends of his conflict with
Viśvā-mitra, who raised himself from the military
to the sacerdotal class, though probably founded on
the actual struggles which took place between the
Brāhmans and Kṣatriyas, were doubtless mostly in-
vented to impress the mind with the power and
superiority of the priesthood; a great many hymns
of the Ṛg-veda are ascribed to these two great
rivals, those of the seventh Maṇḍala, besides some
others, being attributed to Vasiṣṭha, while those of
the third Maṇḍala are assigned to Viśvā-mitra; in
one of Vasiṣṭha's hymns he is represented as king
Su-dās's family priest, an office to which Viśvā-mitra
[Page0896-c+ 81]
also aspired; in another hymn Vasiṣṭha claims to
have been inspired by Varuṇa, and in another [Ṛg-
veda VII. 33, 11] he is called the son of the Apsaras
Urvaśī by Mitra and Varuṇa, whence his patronymic
Maitrāvaruṇi; in Manu I. 35. he is enumerated
among the ten Prajā-patis or Patriarchs produced by
Manu Svāyambhuva for the peopling of the universe;
in the Mahā-bhārata he is mentioned as the family
priest of the solar race or family of Ikṣvāku and
Rāma-candra, and in the Purāṇas as one of the
arrangers of the Vedas in the Dvāpara age; in the
first and second chapters of the Raghu-vaṃśa he is
described as releasing king Dilīpa from his curse of
childlessness by directing him to attend upon the cow
Nandinī in atonement for an offence he had uninten-
tionally committed against the parent cow Surabhi;
according to one account Vasiṣṭha married Ūrjā,
‘Strength;’ according to another, Arundhatī, one of
the Pleiades, by whom he had seven sons [see
{%arundhatī%}]; other legends make him one of the
seven great patriarchal sages regarded as forming the
stars of the Great Bear [see {%ṛṣi%}]; his name is often
written Vaśiṣṭha, q. v., in which case it must be
connected with {%vaśa%} and {%vaśin%}); N. of the author
of a law-book (perhaps intended to be ascribed to
the Vedic Ṛṣi above); ({%ās%}), m. pl. the family of
Vasiṣṭha; ({%Vasiṣṭhasyāṅkuśa%} and {%Vasiṣṭhasyā-%}
{%nupadam,%} N. of two Sāmans.) {%—Vasiṣṭha-tantra,%}
{%am,%} n., N. of a Tantra work. {%—Vasiṣṭha-putra,%}
{%ās,%} m. pl. ‘the sons or descendants of Vasiṣṭha,’ N.
of the authors of Ṛg-veda VII. 33, 10-14. {%—Va-%}
{%siṣṭha-pramukha, as, ā, am,%} preceded or led
by Vasiṣṭha. {%—Vasiṣṭha-prācī,%} f., N. of a place.
{%—Vasiṣṭha-bhṛgv-atri-sama, as, ā, am,%} equal
to (the three great saints) Vasiṣṭha, Bhṛgu, and
Atri (all three being reckoned among the nine
Prajā-patis, Manu I. 35). {%—Vasiṣṭha-saṃhitā,%} f.,
N. of a philosophical treatise; {%= yoga-vāsiṣṭha.%}
{%—Vasiṣṭhāpavāha (°ṭha-ap°), as,%} m., N. of a place
on the Sarasvatī (where that river carried the Ṛṣi Va-
siṣṭha away so that he escaped from Viśvā-mitra).
