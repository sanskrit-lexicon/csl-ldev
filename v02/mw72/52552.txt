{%Sūrya, as,%}¦ m. (perhaps originally {%suvar-ya,%} or
according to some, {%savar-ya, savar%} being for {%sa-%}
{%van,%} cf. the etymology of {%sūra,%} col. 2; according
to Vopa-deva fr. rt. {%sṛ%}), the Sun or its deity, (the
name Sūrya being generally distinguished in the
Veda from Savitṛ, q. v., and Āditya, q. v., as be-
longing to a distinct god; from some passages, how-
ever, it would appear that these names are intended
to be interchangeable as representing various forms
of one and the same divine personality; in the later
mythology Sūrya as Savitṛ is reckoned as one of the
twelve Ādityas or emblems of the Sun in the twelve
months of the year; by Yāska, Nirukta VII. 5, he
is regarded as one of the original Vedic triad, his
place being in the sky, while that of Agni is on the
earth, and that of Indra is in the atmosphere; many
hymns or parts of hymns in the Ṛg-veda are in
praise of Sūrya, e. g. I. 50, I. 115, IV. 13, VII. 60,
X. 37, X. 170; sometimes he is called son of
Dyaus, sometimes of Aditi; in one passage Uṣas,
the Dawn, is his wife, in another he is styled the
child of the Dawns; he moves through the sky in
a chariot drawn by seven ruddy horses or mares
[see {%saptāśva, harit, harid-aśva, śundhyu%}]; he
is described as the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, and
sometimes of Agni; he is all-seeing, ever beholding
the good and bad deeds of mortals, the preserver of
all things stationary and moving; in other passages
he is represented as holding a somewhat secondary
position, being made to shine or have his path pre-
pared for him by Mitra and Varuṇa, by Aryaman,
by Indra, by the Dawns, and others; the long hymn,
Atharva-veda XIII. 2, is entirely in his praise;
there is another addressed to the Sun, called Bhānu,
in Mahā-bhārata, Vana-parvan 166, &c.; and in the
Yuddha-kāṇḍa of the Rāmāyaṇa [VI. 106, Bombay
edit.], Rāma, when about to do battle with Rāvaṇa,
is told by Agastya to repeat a hymn, called Āditya-
hṛdaya, to the Sun, there called Vivasvat, and iden-
tified with Āditya, Savitṛ, Sūrya, Pūṣan, and in
fact with Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva, and all the other
gods; in the later mythology the seven-horsed
chariot of Sūrya is said to be driven by Aruṇa or the
Dawn as its charioteer, who is represented without
legs; the Sun, whether named Sūrya or Vivasvat,
has several wives, see {%sūryā%} below, and cf. {%sa-varṇā,%}
see also {%chāyā, sañ-jñā, aśvinī;%} by Sañjñā he had
two children, Yama and Yamunā, q. q. v. v.; by
Aśvinī, the two Aśvins; by Kuntī, before her mar-
riage with Pāṇḍu, he had Karṇa, q. v.; and he is
also supposed to be the father of Manu Vaivasvata,
and to be the progenitor of one of the two great
lines of Hindū kings [see {%sūrya-vaṃśa%} below];
seven Sūryas are sometimes mentioned, which are
probably the seven planets, the Sun being regarded
as a planet by Hindū astronomers; ninety-four
synonyms of Sūrya are commonly given, and his
epithets are almost innumerable; at the end of a
Kalpa he is called Kāla-sūrya); a symbolical expres-
sion for the number twelve (in allusion to the sun in
the twelve signs of the zodiac); the swallow-wort
(either Calotropis or Asclepias Gigantea, {%= arka%});
N. of the son of Bali; of a Dānava; of an astro-
nomer ({%= sūrya-dāsa%}); epithet of Śiva; ({%ā%}), f. the
wife of Sūrya or the Sun, (also called Sañjñā, q. v.);
the daughter of Sūrya or the Sun, (see Ṛg-veda I.
116, 17; also described as daughter of Savitṛ and
wife of the Aśvins, and in other places as married
to Soma; in Ṛg-veda I. 119, 2. she is called
Ūrjānī, and in VI. 55, 4, VI. 58, 4. the sister of
Pūṣan, q. v., who is described as loving her, and
receiving her as a gift from the gods; according to
some she represents a weak manifestation of the
Sun; Sūryā Sāvitrī is regarded as the authoress of
the Sūryā-sūkta, Ṛg-veda X. 85; in Naigh. I. 11.
Sūryā is enumerated among the {%vāṅ-nāmāni%}); the
hymn about the marriage of Sūryā ({%= sūryā-sūkta,%}
