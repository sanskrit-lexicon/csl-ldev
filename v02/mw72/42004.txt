{%Vālmīki, is,%}¦ m. (also spelt {%vālmiki%}), N. of the
celebrated author of the Rāmāyaṇa, (so called, ac-
cording to some, because when immersed in thought
he allowed himself to be overrun with ants like an
ant-hill; according to one tradition he began life as
a robber, but repenting of his misdeeds betook him-
self to a hermitage on a hill in the district of Banda
in Bundelkund, where he eventually received Sītā,
the wife of Rāma, when banished by her husband.)
