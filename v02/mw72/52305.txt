once worshipped as a kind of goddess resembling
Pomona; in Ṛg-veda IV. 57, 6, Sītā is invoked as
a deity presiding over agriculture or the fruits of the

at the ceremony when these stanzas are recited); N.

while ploughing the ground to prepare it for a sacri-
fice instituted by him to obtain progeny, whence

place of her birth; according to one legend she was
Veda-vatī, q. v., in the Kṛta age; according to others

the story of Rāma's bending the bow, which was to be

I. 67; Sītā's younger sister Ūrmilā was at the same
