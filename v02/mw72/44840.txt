<div n="lb"/><nsi>weizd</nsi>), knowing, knowledge; ‘the true knowledge,
<div n="lb"/>divine knowledge,’ N. of certain celebrated works
<div n="lb"/>which constitute the basis of the first period of the
<div n="lb"/>Hindū religion, (these works were originally three,
<div n="lb"/>viz. 1. the Ṛg-veda, 2. the Yajur-veda [of which
<div n="lb"/>there are, however, two divisions, see {%taittirīya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%saṃhitā, vājasaneyi-saṃhitā%}], 3. the Sāma-veda;
<div n="lb"/>these three works are sometimes called collectively,
<div n="lb"/>{%trayī,%} ‘the triple Vidyā’ or ‘threefold knowledge,’
<div n="lb"/>but the Ṛg-veda is really the only original work
<div n="lb"/>of the three, and much the most ancient, some of its
<div n="lb"/>hymns being rather Indo-European than Hindū, and
<div n="lb"/>representing the condition of the Āryans before their
<div n="lb"/>final settlement in India; subsequently a fourth Veda
<div n="lb"/>was added, called the Atharva-veda, which was pro-
<div n="lb"/>bably not completely accepted till after Manu, as his
<div n="lb"/>law-book often speaks of the three Vedas — calling
<div n="lb"/>them {%trayam brahma sanātanam,%} ‘the triple
<div n="lb"/>eternal Veda,’ and stating in I. 23. that the Creator
<div n="lb"/>drew forth the Ṛg-veda from fire, the Yajur-veda
<div n="lb"/>from air, and the Sāma-veda from the sun; and in
<div n="lb"/>another place, IV. 124, stating that the Ṛg has the
<div n="lb"/>gods for its deities, the Yajur has men, and the Sāma
<div n="lb"/>has the Pitṛs, on which account the sound of this
<div n="lb"/>latter is impure — but only once [XI. 33] mentions the
<div n="lb"/>revelation made to Atharvan and Aṅgiras, without,
<div n="lb"/>however, calling it by the later name of Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda, the songs and incantations of the Atharvans
<div n="lb"/>not being at that time recognised as a fourth Veda;
<div n="lb"/>each of the four Vedas has two distinct parts, viz.
<div n="lb"/>1. a Saṃhitā or collection of Mantras, i. e. of words
<div n="lb"/>of prayer and adoration often addressed either to fire
<div n="lb"/>or to some form of the sun or to some form of the
<div n="lb"/>air, sky, wind, &c., and praying for health, wealth, long
<div n="lb"/>life, cattle, offspring, victory, and even forgiveness of
<div n="lb"/>sins, which words of prayer or praise form what is
<div n="lb"/>usually called the Mantra portion of the Veda [see
<div n="lb"/>{%mantra%}], and 2. a Brāhmaṇa portion consisting of
<div n="lb"/>Vidhi and Artha-vāda, i. e. directions for the detail
<div n="lb"/>of the ceremonies at which the Mantras were to be
<div n="lb"/>used and explanations of the legends &c. connected
<div n="lb"/>with the Mantras [see {%brāhmaṇa, vidhi%}], both
<div n="lb"/>these portions being termed {%Śruti,%} revelation orally
<div n="lb"/>communicated by the Deity, and heard but not com-
<div n="lb"/>posed or written down by men; although both portions
<div n="lb"/>are supposed by orthodox Hindūs to have existed
<div n="lb"/>from eternity, and not to require {%pramāṇa,%} ‘proof,’
<div n="lb"/>as they are themselves Pramāṇa, yet the oldest of
<div n="lb"/>the Mantras are not likely to belong to a much earlier
<div n="lb"/>date than the twelfth or thirteenth century B. C.;
<div n="lb"/>and it is certain that both Mantras and Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>were compositions spread over a considerable period,
<div n="lb"/>much of the latter being comparatively modern: as
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas are properly three, so the Mantras are
<div n="lb"/>properly of three forms, 1. Ṛc, which are verses of
<div n="lb"/>praise in metre, and intended for loud recitation;
<div n="lb"/>2. Yajus, which are in prose, and intended for use
<div n="lb"/>at sacrifices; 3. Sāman, which are in metre, and
<div n="lb"/>intended for chanting at the Soma or Moon-plant
<div n="lb"/>ceremonies, the Mantras of the Atharva-veda having
<div n="lb"/>no special name; but it must be borne in mind that
<div n="lb"/>the Yajur and Sāma-veda hymns, especially the latter,
<div n="lb"/>besides their own Mantras, borrow largely from the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛg-veda; the Yajur-veda and Sāma-veda being in
<div n="lb"/>fact not so much collections of prayers and hymns as
[Page0964-a+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>special prayer and hymn-books intended as liturgical
<div n="lb"/>or sacrificial manuals for the Adhvaryu and Udgātṛ
<div n="lb"/>priests respectively, the necessity for which grew out
<div n="lb"/>of the vast and complicated ritual elaborated by the
<div n="lb"/>Āryans after they had settled down in India [see
<div n="lb"/>{%yajur-veda, sāma-veda%}]; the more modern Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda-saṃhitā, on the other hand, is, like the Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda, a real collection of original hymns mixed up with
<div n="lb"/>incantations, borrowing little from the Ṛg, having
<div n="lb"/>no direct relation to mere ritual or sacrifices, but
<div n="lb"/>supposed by mere recitation to produce long life, to
<div n="lb"/>cure diseases [generally in connection with the use of
<div n="lb"/>some plant or drug gifted with magical properties],
<div n="lb"/>to obtain success in love or gaming, to effect the
<div n="lb"/>ruin of enemies, and to secure the reciter's own pros-
<div n="lb"/>perity; each of the four Vedas seems to have passed
<div n="lb"/>through numerous Śākhās or schools, giving rise to
<div n="lb"/>various recensions of the text, though the Ṛg-veda
<div n="lb"/>is only preserved in the Śākala recension; as to
<div n="lb"/>arrangement, the Mantras being made up in the first
<div n="lb"/>instance of separate Padas or words are joined together
<div n="lb"/>so as to form Sūktas or hymns; the hymns of the
<div n="lb"/>Yajur-veda, with the exception of its last book, which
<div n="lb"/>is thought to be mystical, are arranged according to
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifices at which its Mantras were used, and
<div n="lb"/>those of the Sāma-veda with reference especially to
<div n="lb"/>the Moon-plant sacrifices, but those of the Ṛg-veda
<div n="lb"/>Mantras having no direct reference to sacrificial acts
<div n="lb"/>are arranged either according to their authors and
<div n="lb"/>the objects addressed or according to mere bulk;
<div n="lb"/>the former is the distribution into ten Maṇḍalas, the
<div n="lb"/>first and last three Maṇḍalas including a variety of
<div n="lb"/>authors or rather Ṛṣis [who are said to have seen
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and not composed them], and each of the
<div n="lb"/>other Maṇḍalas belonging to one particular Ṛṣi;
<div n="lb"/>the latter is the distribution into Aṣṭakas [see {%maṇ-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ḍala, varga%}]: a tradition makes Vyāsa the com-
<div n="lb"/>piler and arranger of the Vedas in their present
<div n="lb"/>form: they each have an Anukramaṇī or Index,
<div n="lb"/>giving the first word of every hymn, the number of
<div n="lb"/>verses, the name of the {%devatā%} or deified being
<div n="lb"/>about which the Mantra is concerned [sometimes,
<div n="lb"/>however, the {%devatā%} may be an inanimate object],
<div n="lb"/>the names and families of the authors and the metre,
<div n="lb"/>the principal work of this kind being the Sarvānu-
<div n="lb"/>kramaṇī or general Index; out of the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>portion of the Veda grew two other departments of
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature, sometimes included under the general
<div n="lb"/>name Veda, viz. the strings of aphoristic rules, called
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras [though these are often said to be {%pauruṣeya,%}
<div n="lb"/>i. e. human compositions], and the mystical treatises
<div n="lb"/>on the nature of God and the relation of soul and
<div n="lb"/>matter, called Upaniṣads, which were appended to
<div n="lb"/>the Āraṇyakas, certain chapters of the Brāhmaṇas so
<div n="lb"/>obscure and awe-inspiring in their allusions to the
<div n="lb"/>Supreme Spirit of the Universe that they had to be
<div n="lb"/>read in the solitude of forests; the most important
<div n="lb"/>of the former are the Kalpa-sūtras or Śrauta-sūtras
<div n="lb"/>as founded directly on Śruti; these strings of rules
<div n="lb"/>being in fact guides to the rambling discursive Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas and systematized directories for the due per-
<div n="lb"/>formance of every part of the ceremonial, while the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads, on the other hand, taught the secret
<div n="lb"/>doctrine [called {%rahasya%} in Manu II. 165. and {%ve-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%dānta%} in VI. 83, 94] underlying the ceremonial, viz.
<div n="lb"/>the existence of one Universal Spirit, called Brahma,
<div n="lb"/>with which the whole creation and the human soul
<div n="lb"/>itself was identified; as the Śrauta-sūtras were fol-
<div n="lb"/>lowed by the Gṛhya and Sāmayācārika Sūtras or
<div n="lb"/>‘rules for domestic ceremonies and conventional cus-
<div n="lb"/>toms,’ which again became the forerunners of the
<div n="lb"/>Dharma-śāstras and thus linked the Veda with the
<div n="lb"/>code of Manu, so the Āraṇyakas were followed by
<div n="lb"/>the Upaniṣads, which latter became the real Veda of
<div n="lb"/>thinking Hindūs, leading to the Darśanas or systems
<div n="lb"/>of philosophy, and linking them also with Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature: in modern writings the name of ‘fifth
<div n="lb"/>Veda' is accorded to the Itihāsas or legendary epic
<div n="lb"/>poems and the Purāṇas, and certain Upa-vedas or
<div n="lb"/>secondary Vedas are enumerated, that of the Ṛg-
<div n="lb"/>veda being the Āyur-veda or Veda on medicine, that
[Page0964-b+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>of the Yajur being the Dhanur-veda or Veda on
<div n="lb"/>archery, that of the Sāma being the Gāndharva-veda
<div n="lb"/>or Veda on music, and that of the Atharva-veda
<div n="lb"/>being either the Sthāpatya-veda or Artha-śāstra or
<div n="lb"/>Śilpa-śāstra, q. q. v. v.; the Vedāṅgas or works serv-
<div n="lb"/>ing as limbs [for preserving the integrity] of the
<div n="lb"/>Veda, of which the Kalpa-sūtras form a part, are
<div n="lb"/>explained under {%vedāṅga,%} col. 3: the only other
<div n="lb"/>works included under the head of Veda being the
<div n="lb"/>Pariśiṣṭas, which supply rules for the ritual omitted
<div n="lb"/>in other works; in the Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad
<div n="lb"/>the Vedas and all the above literature are represented
<div n="lb"/>as the breathings of Brahmā, while in some of the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas the four Vedas are said to have been created
<div n="lb"/>by the four-faced Brahmā from his several mouths,
<div n="lb"/>and in the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa the Veda and Viṣṇu are

<div n="lb"/>of certain works or classes of works regarded as

<div n="lb"/>nunciation and correctness of the text and the right
<div n="lb"/>employment of the Mantras at sacrifices as taught
<div n="lb"/>in the Brāhmaṇas; six subjects are usually enume-
<div n="lb"/>rated under which these works are comprised, and
<div n="lb"/>six works are given as representatives of these subjects,
<div n="lb"/>mostly written in the Sūtra or aphoristic style, but
<div n="lb"/>whether all of these are the original representa-
<div n="lb"/>tives of the various subjects is doubtful; 1. {%Śikṣā,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘the science of proper articulation and pronunciation,’
<div n="lb"/>comprising the knowledge of letters, accents, quantity,
<div n="lb"/>the use of the organs of pronunciation, and phonetics
<div n="lb"/>generally, but especially the laws of euphony peculiar
<div n="lb"/>to the Veda; one short treatise consisting in one
<div n="lb"/>recension of thirty-five and in another of fifty-nine
<div n="lb"/>verses, and a chapter of the Taittirīya-āraṇyaka are
<div n="lb"/>regarded as the representatives of this subject; but
<div n="lb"/>the more modern Prātiśākhyas and other works
<div n="lb"/>on Vedic phonetics may be included under it, [see
<div n="lb"/>{%prātiśākhya%}]: 2. {%Chandas,%} ‘metre,’ represented
<div n="lb"/>by a treatise ascribed to Piṅgala-nāga, which, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, treats of Prākṛt as well as Sanskrit metres,
<div n="lb"/>and includes only a few of the leading Vedic metres:
<div n="lb"/>3. {%Vy-ākaraṇa,%} ‘linguistic analysis or grammar,’
<div n="lb"/>said to be represented by Pāṇini's celebrated Sūtras,
<div n="lb"/>but as this great work only treats of Vedic grammar
<div n="lb"/>exceptionally, this Vedāṅga is more properly identi-
<div n="lb"/>fied with the lost grammatical Sūtras which preceded
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇini: 4. {%Nir-ukta,%} ‘explanation of difficult Vedic
<div n="lb"/>words,’ represented by the Nirukta of Yāska, which
<div n="lb"/>consists of five chapters of mere lists of words, three
<div n="lb"/>belonging to the Naighaṇṭuka section of synonyms,
<div n="lb"/>one to the Naigama of separate words, and one
<div n="lb"/>to the Daivata of divinities and the other objects
[Page0965-a+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>addressed in the Mantras; after which come twelve
<div n="lb"/>chapters of explanation with an introduction, to which
<div n="lb"/>is also added a Pariśiṣṭa of two other chapters, [see
<div n="lb"/>{%yāska%}]: 5. {%Jyotiṣa,%} ‘astronomy,’ or rather the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic calendar, represented by a small tract in a
<div n="lb"/>more modern style than the Sūtra works, the object
<div n="lb"/>of which is to fix the most auspicious days for sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fices: 6. {%Kalpa,%} ‘ceremonial,’ represented by a large
<div n="lb"/>number of Sūtra works intended to systematize the
<div n="lb"/>tedious and confused ritualistic precepts of the Brāh-

<div n="lb"/>the first and second of these Vedāṅgas is said to
<div n="lb"/>be intended to secure the correct reading or recitation
<div n="lb"/>of the Veda, the third and fourth the understanding
<div n="lb"/>of it, and the fifth and sixth its proper employment
<div n="lb"/>at sacrifices: the Vedāṅgas are alluded to by Manu,

<div n="lb"/>‘end of the Veda,’ N. of the second and most im-

<div n="lb"/>great divisions of Hindū philosophy (so called either
<div n="lb"/>as teaching the ultimate aim and scope of the Veda
<div n="lb"/>or simply as founded on the Upaniṣads which come
<div n="lb"/>at the end of the Veda; this system, although be-
<div n="lb"/>longing to the Mīmāṃsā school [see {%mīmāṃsā%}] and
<div n="lb"/>sometimes called Uttara-mīmāṃsā, ‘examination of
<div n="lb"/>the later portion or {%jñāna-kāṇḍa%} of the Veda,’
<div n="lb"/>i. e. of that portion contained in the Āraṇyakas and
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads [which teach the knowledge of Brahma or
<div n="lb"/>the Universal Spirit], stands out prominently by itself
<div n="lb"/>as representing the popular pantheistic creed of the
<div n="lb"/>Hindūs of the present day, which is really based on
<div n="lb"/>the Upaniṣads and constitutes the true Veda of
<div n="lb"/>the modern cultivated Brāhman, underlying also
<div n="lb"/>all the polytheism and multiform mythology of
<div n="lb"/>the people; it explains the universe synthetically
<div n="lb"/>as a development from one principle, and so
<div n="lb"/>differs from the analytical Nyāya which treats of
<div n="lb"/>the various objects constituting the material world
<div n="lb"/>as it finds them, without investigating their mutual
<div n="lb"/>relation of effect and cause, and from the Sāṅkhya
<div n="lb"/>which, although also synthetic, propounds a duality
<div n="lb"/>of principles to account for the visible universe;
<div n="lb"/>according to the Vedānta doctrine, Brahma [nom.
<div n="lb"/>neut. of {%brahman%}] or the Supreme Soul, also called
<div n="lb"/>Paramātman, is both the efficient and material cause
<div n="lb"/>of the world; the Ātman or individual human soul,
<div n="lb"/>as well as all the phenomena of nature, being really
<div n="lb"/>identical with the Paramātman, and their existence
<div n="lb"/>being only the result of Ajñāna or an assumed igno-
<div n="lb"/>rance on the part of this Supreme Soul, who is
<div n="lb"/>described as both Creator and Creation, Actor and
<div n="lb"/>Act, Existence, Knowledge, Joy, and as devoid of
<div n="lb"/>the three qualities, [see {%guṇa%}]; the liberation of the
<div n="lb"/>human soul, its deliverance from transmigrations, and
<div n="lb"/>re-union with the Paramātman, with which it is
<div n="lb"/>really identified, is only to be effected by a removal
<div n="lb"/>of that ignorance which prevents the consciousness
<div n="lb"/>of this identity and by a proper understanding of the
<div n="lb"/>truth of the Vedānta; this system is also sometimes
[Page0965-b+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>called Brahma-mīmāṃsā and Śārīraka-mīmāṃsā, ‘in-
<div n="lb"/>vestigation of the embodied soul:’ the founder of the
