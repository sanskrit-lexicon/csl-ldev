{#शिव#}¦ {%śiva, as, ā, am%} (according to Uṇādi-s.
<div n="lb"/>I. 153. fr. rt. 1. {%śī;%} more probably to be connected
<div n="lb"/>with rt. {%śvi%} and {%śavas,%} see {%śiśvi%}), auspicious, pro-
<div n="lb"/>pitious, prosperous, happy, fortunate, lucky, increas-
<div n="lb"/>ing, thriving, right; ({%as%}), m., N. of the third god
<div n="lb"/>of the Hindū Tri-mūrti, (in the later mythology
<div n="lb"/>regarded as ‘the destroyer,’ and with Brahmā, ‘the
<div n="lb"/>creator,’ and Viṣṇu, ‘the preserver,’ constituting
<div n="lb"/>the well known Hindū triad of divine manifestations;
<div n="lb"/>although the name Śiva is not found applied to any
<div n="lb"/>god in the Veda, the worship of the destroying and
<div n="lb"/>reproducing principle under this name was rapidly
<div n="lb"/>developed in the Purāṇas and epic poems, and be-
<div n="lb"/>came very general in later times, the worshippers of
<div n="lb"/>Śiva or Śaivas assigning to him the first place in the
<div n="lb"/>triad and by identifying him with the principles of
<div n="lb"/>creation and reproduction as well as that of destruc-
<div n="lb"/>tion, constituting him the one Supreme Being who
<div n="lb"/>is supposed to comprehend all the powers and forces
<div n="lb"/>of nature and whose formidable character makes him
<div n="lb"/>the first object of propitiation and adoration; in the
<div n="lb"/>Śiva-Purāṇa he is addressed as Brahmā, Viṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>Indra, Varuṇa, the Sun, Moon, Earth, Fire, Water,
<div n="lb"/>Air, Ether, &c., while even in the Viṣṇu and other
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas not specially devoted to his praise, he is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned with the greatest reverence and awe;
<div n="lb"/>according to one view the name Śiva belonged
<div n="lb"/>originally to the principal god of the aboriginal
<div n="lb"/>tribes of India, and being subsequently adopted
<div n="lb"/>together with the Liṅga or symbol of reproduction
<div n="lb"/>into the Pantheon of the Āryans, was then identified
<div n="lb"/>with their own deity Rudra, who occupies a con-
<div n="lb"/>spicuous position in the Veda as god of storms; but
<div n="lb"/>according to a more likely supposition the adjective
<div n="lb"/>{%śiva,%} ‘auspicious,’ being at first only used as an
<div n="lb"/>euphemistic epithet to propitiate the lord of tempests,
<div n="lb"/>passed afterwards into his name, and was ultimately
<div n="lb"/>adopted as the principal name of the god of destruc-
<div n="lb"/>tion, [see {%rudra%}]; according to Viṣṇu-Purāṇa I. 8.
<div n="lb"/>there are eight principal manifestations of Śiva, viz.
<div n="lb"/>Rudra, Bhava, Śarva, Iśāna, Paśu-pati, Bhīma, Ugra,
<div n="lb"/>Mahā-deva, which again are visibly represented under
<div n="lb"/>eight Tanus or material forms, viz. the Sun, Water,
<div n="lb"/>Earth, Air, Fire, Ether, the officiating Brahman,
<div n="lb"/>and the Moon, Śiva being supposed to uphold the
<div n="lb"/>universe by means of these forms; as presiding over
<div n="lb"/>reproduction, which follows destruction, his symbol
<div n="lb"/>is the Liṅga or Phallus, under which form he is
<div n="lb"/>generally worshipped at the present day; as god of
<div n="lb"/>justice or punishment, which character he shares with
<div n="lb"/>the gods Yama and Varuṇa, he is represented as
<div n="lb"/>riding on a white bull, the god Dharma, it is said,
<div n="lb"/>having taken this form and requested Śiva to accept
<div n="lb"/>him as his vehicle; his own colour is sometimes
<div n="lb"/>depicted as black in his character of destroyer of the
<div n="lb"/>world, when he is called Kāla or Time; again, one
<div n="lb"/>of his representations is as Ardha-nārī, ‘half-female,’
<div n="lb"/>the other half being male to symbolize the unity of
<div n="lb"/>the generative principle, his name being then Ardha-
<div n="lb"/>nārīśa, ‘the half-female lord;’ he has sometimes five
<div n="lb"/>faces, whence his name Pāñcānana; he has also three
[Page1007-c+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>eyes, one of which is in his forehead, and which are
<div n="lb"/>thought to denote his view of the three divisions of
<div n="lb"/>time, past, present, and future, while a moon's
<div n="lb"/>crescent, round or above the central eye, marks the
<div n="lb"/>measure of time by months, a serpent round his
<div n="lb"/>neck the measure of time by years, and a second
<div n="lb"/>necklace of skulls with numerous other serpents about
<div n="lb"/>his person, the perpetual revolution of ages, and the
<div n="lb"/>successive extinction and generation of the races of
<div n="lb"/>mankind: his hair is thickly matted together, and
<div n="lb"/>gathered above his forehead into a coil, so as to
<div n="lb"/>project like a horn; on the top of it he bears the
<div n="lb"/>Ganges, the rush of which river in its descent form
<div n="lb"/>heaven he intercepted by his head that the earth
<div n="lb"/>might not be crushed by the weight of the falling
<div n="lb"/>stream; his throat is dark-blue from the stain of the
<div n="lb"/>deadly poison which would have destroyed the world
<div n="lb"/>had it not been swallowed by him on its production
<div n="lb"/>at the churning of the ocean by the gods for the
<div n="lb"/>nectar of immortality: he is sometimes represented
<div n="lb"/>clothed in a deer-skin, sometimes in a tiger-skin, or
<div n="lb"/>he appears sitting on a tiger-skin or holding a deer
<div n="lb"/>in one of his hands; in explanation of this a legend
<div n="lb"/>is told that Śiva, having once visited a forest in the
<div n="lb"/>form of a religious mendicant, the wives of the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛṣis residing there fell in love with his great
<div n="lb"/>beauty, which the Ṛṣis perceiving resented; in
<div n="lb"/>order, therefore, to overpower him, they first dug a
<div n="lb"/>pit, and by magical arts caused a tiger to rush out of
<div n="lb"/>it, which he slew, and taking its skin wore it as a
<div n="lb"/>garment; they next caused a deer to spring out upon
<div n="lb"/>him, which he took up in his left hand and ever
<div n="lb"/>afterwards retained there; they then produced a red-
<div n="lb"/>hot iron, but this too he took up and kept in his
<div n="lb"/>hand as a weapon: sometimes, again, he appears
<div n="lb"/>wearing an elephant's skin which belonged to an
<div n="lb"/>Asura named Gaya, who acquired such power that
<div n="lb"/>he conquered the gods and would have destroyed the
<div n="lb"/>Munis had they not fled to Benares and taken
<div n="lb"/>refuge in a temple of Śiva, who then destroyed the
<div n="lb"/>Asura and, ripping up his body, stripped off the hide
<div n="lb"/>which he afterwards cast over his shoulders for a
<div n="lb"/>cloak: Śiva holds a {%triśūla%} or three-pronged trident
<div n="lb"/>[also called Pināka] in his hand to denote, as some
<div n="lb"/>think, his combination of the three attributes of
<div n="lb"/>Creator, Destroyer, and Regenerator; his other
<div n="lb"/>weapons are a bow called Ajakava or Ajagava, a
<div n="lb"/>thunderbolt, an axe, a kind of staff with transverse
<div n="lb"/>pieces surmounted by a skull called Khaṭvāṅga, and
<div n="lb"/>another nondescript weapon called Khiṅkira; he also
<div n="lb"/>carries a kind of rattle or drum, shaped like an hour-
<div n="lb"/>glass, called Ḍamaru, and a Pāśa or noose for binding
<div n="lb"/>incorrigible offenders: his attendants or servants are
<div n="lb"/>called Pramatha; they are sometimes regarded as
<div n="lb"/>demons or supernatural beings of various kinds, and
<div n="lb"/>form a complete host; some of his more personal
<div n="lb"/>attendants or chamberlains have special names, such
<div n="lb"/>as Nandi or Nandin, Bhṛṅgin, Taṇḍu, the latter
<div n="lb"/>being the original teacher of dancing &c., whence
<div n="lb"/>Śiva is called Naṭeśvara, ‘the lord of dancers,’ and is
<div n="lb"/>himself described as {%nāṭya-priya,%} fond of dancing:
<div n="lb"/>his principal wife Durgā, otherwise called Pārvatī,
<div n="lb"/>Umā, Gaurī, Bhavānī, Satī, &c., is the chief object
<div n="lb"/>of worship with the Śāktas and Tāntrikas, see {%śakti,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śākta, tantra:%} his sons are Gaṇeśa and Kārttikeya:
<div n="lb"/>he destroyed several Asuras or demons, such as Pura,
<div n="lb"/>Tripura, Andhaka, Ruru; he also scorched the god
<div n="lb"/>of love, Kāma-deva, to ashes by a glance from his
<div n="lb"/>central eye, that deity having attempted to inflame
<div n="lb"/>him with passion for Pārvatī whilst he was engaged
<div n="lb"/>in severe penance; he is said to have cut off one of
<div n="lb"/>the heads of the god Brahmā, that god having ori-
<div n="lb"/>ginally possessed five heads, one of which is fabled
<div n="lb"/>to have addressed Śiva on a particular occasion in a
<div n="lb"/>disrespectful manner, cf. {%brahma-mūrdha-bhṛt;%}
<div n="lb"/>he also decapitated Dakṣa and replaced his head by
<div n="lb"/>that of a ram, because that sage, who was his father-
<div n="lb"/>in-law, omitted to invite him and his wife Satī to a
<div n="lb"/>great sacrifice at which all the other gods were
<div n="lb"/>present, see {%dakṣādhvara-dhvaṃśa-kṛt;%} in the
<div n="lb"/>exercise of his function of Universal Destroyer he
[Page1008-a+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>destroys, at the end of every Kalpa, not only all
<div n="lb"/>created beings, but even Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and the
<div n="lb"/>other gods, whose bones and skulls he wears as gar-
<div n="lb"/>lands; moreover, at the end of one of the early
<div n="lb"/>Kalpas he is fabled to have burnt them up by a flash
<div n="lb"/>from his central eye, and afterwards to have rubbed
<div n="lb"/>their ashes upon his body, whence the use of ashes
<div n="lb"/>is considered of great importance in his worship,
<div n="lb"/>while the use of the Rudrākṣa berries or beads
<div n="lb"/>originated, it is said, from the legend that Śiva, on
<div n="lb"/>his way to destroy the three cities, called Tri-pura,
<div n="lb"/>let fall some tears of rage which became converted
<div n="lb"/>into these beads: his residence is Kailāsa, one of the
<div n="lb"/>loftiest northern peaks of the Himālaya, which is
<div n="lb"/>also the paradise of Kuvera: he has strictly no in-
<div n="lb"/>carnations like those of Viṣṇu, though Vīra-bhadra
<div n="lb"/>and the eight Bhairavas are sometimes regarded as
<div n="lb"/>forms of him, sometimes as his sons, see {%vīra-bha-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%dra, bhairava;%} he is especially worshipped at Be-
<div n="lb"/>nares and has even more names than Viṣṇu, one
<div n="lb"/>thousand and eight being specified in the sixty-ninth
<div n="lb"/>chapter of the Śiva-Purāṇa and in the seventeenth
<div n="lb"/>chapter of the Anuśāsana-parvan of the Mahā-bhā-
