<div n="lb"/>nymic, N. of the author of the Nirukta or commen-
<div n="lb"/>tary on the difficult Vedic words contained in the
<div n="lb"/>lists called Nighaṇṭus, (these consist of three divisions,
<div n="lb"/>1. the Naighaṇṭuka or a list of synonymous words,
<div n="lb"/>2. the Naigama or words usually occurring in the
<div n="lb"/>Veda only, 3. the Daivata or words relating to deities
<div n="lb"/>and sacrificial acts; according to some, these three
<div n="lb"/>lists were drawn up by Yāska himself, and then com-
<div n="lb"/>mented on in his Nirukta, which quotes Vedic pas-
<div n="lb"/>sages in illustration of the words, and is the oldest
<div n="lb"/>Vedic commentary extant; Yāska is supposed to
<div n="lb"/>have lived before Pāṇini); ({%ās%}), m. pl. the pupils of
<div n="lb"/>Yaska.
