{%Yama, as,%}¦ m. a rein, curb, bridle (Ved.); a
driver, charioteer (Ved.); restraining, controlling,
taming, keeping in check, restraint, ({%vācāṃ yamaḥ,%}
restraint of words, silence); self-control, any great
moral duty or observance, (as opposed to {%niyama,%}
a minor duty or observance, see Manu IV. 204;
some of the Yamas are as follow, ‘restraining the
organs of sense,’ ‘chastity, and the control of all
sensual desires,’ ‘refraining from violence or injury,’
‘patience,’ ‘truthfulness,’ ‘honesty’); a twin, one of
a pair or couple, a fellow, ({%yamau,%} ‘the twins,’ an
epithet of the Aśvins and of their twin children by
Mādrī, called Nakula and Sahadeva); a symbolical
expression for the number two; N. of the god who
presides over the Pitṛs, q. v., and rules the spirits of
the dead, (he is regarded in Post-vedic mythology
as the appointed Judge and ‘Restrainer’ or Punisher
of the dead, in which capacity he corresponds to the
Greek Pluto and to Minos; he is one of the eight
guardians of the world as regent of the South quarter,
in which direction in some region of the lower
world is his abode, called Yama-pura; thither a soul,
when it leaves the body, is said to repair, and there,
after the recorder, Citra-gupta, has read an account
of its actions kept in a book called Agra-sandhānī,
it receives a just sentence, either ascending to heaven
or to the world of the Pitṛs or being driven down
to one of the twenty-one hells [called the awful
provinces of the kingdom of Yama] to be born
again, after undergoing its appointed recompense
of bliss or pain, in higher or lower forms of being;
in unison with these functions Yama is sometimes
called ‘king of Justice’ or simply ‘Justice’ [see
{%dharma-rāja, dharma%}], sometimes ‘Rod-bearer’
or ‘Noose-bearer’ [see {%daṇḍa-dhara, pāśin%}], some-
times ‘lord of the Pitṛs or Manes’ [see {%pitṛ-pati%}],
sometimes ‘king of Death’ or simply ‘Death’ [see
{%mṛtyu-rāj, mṛtyu, kāla, antaka%}], sometimes
‘god of the Śrāddha’ [see {%śrāddha-deva%}]: in the
Vana-parvan of the Mahā-bhārata, 1. 16754, where
there is a story of his appearing to a dying man, he
is described as dressed in blood-red garments, with
a glittering form, a crown on his head, glowing
eyes, and, like Varuṇa, holding a noose, with which
he binds the spirit after drawing it from the body,
in size about the measure of a man's thumb: he is
otherwise represented as grim in aspect, green in
colour, clothed in red, riding on a buffalo, and
holding a club in one hand and noose in the other:
he is said to possess two four-eyed watch-dogs, called
[Page0810-a+ 81]
Karbura [<nsi>= Cerberus?</nsi>], ‘spotted,’ and Śyāma,
‘dark,’ which guard the road to his abode: in the
later mythology he is always represented as a terrible
deity inflicting tortures, called {%yātanā,%} on departed
souls: according to some the earlier legends point
to the original meanings of his name being ‘twin,’
and make him a kind of first man, Yama and his
twin sister Yamī being the first pair of beings
born from Vivasvat, ‘the Sun,’ and his wife Sa-
raṇyū; the seventh Manu, another form of the first
man, being also born from the Sun, and so regarded
as a brother of Yama, [see especially Ṛg-veda X. 10,
part of which is ascribed to the authorship of Yama
Vaivasvata, and cf. {%Vaivasvata%}]; Yama is, how-
ever, described as resisting sexual alliance with his
sister; Yama is also regarded as the regent of
the Nakṣatra Apabharaṇī or Bharaṇī, see {%yama-%}

key; ({%as, ā%} or {%ī, am%}), twin-born, twin, double,
