{%Manu, us,%}¦ m. (Ved.) thought, mental faculty ({%=%}
{%manana-śakti%}); (Ved.) a sacred text, prayer, incan-
tation, spell ({%= mantra,%} perhaps erroneously thus
explained in Mahā-bh. Ādi-p. 52); (Ved.) a man,
mankind, as opposed to evil spirits, (in Ṛg-veda III.
60, 3, the Ṛbhus are called the sons of man, {%ma-%}
{%nor napātaḥ%}); the Man par excellence, or the repre-
sentative man and father of the human race (regarded
in the earlier mythological system as the first to
have instituted sacrifices and religious ceremonies;
and in Ṛg-veda 1. 139, 9, associated with the Ṛṣis
Kaṇva and Atri; in the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa de-
scribed as dividing his possessions among some of
his sons to the exclusion of one called Nābhā-
nediṣṭha, q. v.; called Sāmvaraṇa as author of Ṛg-
veda IX. 101, 10-12; Āpsava as author of Rig-veda
IX. 106, 7-9; in the fifth chapter of the Nighaṇ-
ṭavas numbered among the thirty-one divine beings
of the upper sphere, and as father of men even iden-
tified with Prajā-pati; but the name Manu is especially
applied to fourteen successive mythical progenitors
and sovereigns of the earth, described in the code of
Manu 1. 63 and in the later mythology as creating
and supporting this world of moving and stationary
beings through successive Antaras or long periods of
time, see {%manv-antara,%} col. 2: the first in order of
these Manus is called Svāyambhuva, as sprung from
{%Svayam-bhū,%} the Self-existent, who being identified
with Brahmā, according to one account, divided
himself into two persons, male and female, whence
was produced Virāj, and from him the first Manu;
or who, according to another account, converted
himself at once into the first man called Manu
Svāyambhuva, and the first woman called Śata-rūpā;
this Manu Svāyambhuva is described in Manu 1. 34
as a sort of secondary creator, who commenced the
work of creation by producing ten Prajāpatis or
Maharṣis, of whom the first was {%Marici,%} Light,
see {%prajā-pati;%} and to this first Manu is ascribed
both the celebrated law-book known as the ‘code of
Manu,’ see {%manu-saṃhitā,%} as well as an ancient
Sūtra work on Kalpa or Vedic ritual; he is himself
sometimes called Prajā-pati, and rarely Hairaṇya-
garbha as son of Hiraṇya-garbha, and Prācetasa as
son of Pracetas: the next five Manus in regular
succession are called Svārociṣa, Auttami, Tāmasa.
Raivata, Cākṣuṣa: the seventh Manu, called {%Vai-%}
{%vasvata,%} Sun-born, is the Manu of the present period;
he is held to be the son of Vivasvat or the Sun, who
according to Rāmāyaṇa 11. 110, 6, was the son of
Kaśyapa, son of Marīci, this latter being described
as proceeding directly from Brahmā, and thus adding
to the confusion in the different Hindū accounts of
the gradation of personages interposed between the
Supreme Being and the created world; this seventh
Manu, called Vaivasvata, and sometimes, from his
piety, Satya-vrata, is regarded as the progenitor of
the present race of living beings, and has been com-
pared to the Noah of the Old Testament from various
legends current in Sanskrit literature of his preser-
vation from a great flood by Viṣṇu or, according
to some, by Brahmā in the form of a fish: he is
also variously described as the son of Āditya or as
one of the twelve Ādityas, as the author of the
hymns Ṛg-veda VIII. 27-31, as the brother of Yama,
who as son of the Sun is also called Vaivasvata, as the
founder and first king of Ayodhyā, afterwards reigned
[Page0743-b+ 81]
over by his son Ikṣvāku, and as father of Ilā who
married Budha, son of the Moon, the two great solar
and lunar races being thus nearly related to each
other; the eighth Manu or first of the future Manus,
according to the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa 111. 2, will be Sā-
varṇi; the ninth, Dakṣa-sāvarṇi; the tenth, Brahma-
sāvarṇi; the eleventh, Dharma-sāvarṇi; the twelfth,
Rudra-sāvarṇi; the thirteenth, Raucya or, accord-
ing to some, Deva-sāvarṇi; and the fourteenth,
Bhautya or Indra-sāvarṇi); {%(avas),%} m. pl. the mental
