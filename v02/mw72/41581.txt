Campāraṇya in 1479; at an early age he commenced
travelling to propagate his doctrines, and at the court
of Kṛṣṇa-deva, king of Vijaya-nagara, succeeded
so well in his controversies with the Śaivas that the
Vaiṣṇavas chose him as their chief; he then went
to other parts of India, and finally settled down at
Benares, where he composed seventeen works, the
most important of which were a commentary on the
Vedānta and Mīmāṃsā Sūtras and another on the Bhā-
gavata-Purāṇa, which last, as inculcating the worship
of Kṛṣṇa, is the chief religious work on which this
sect rest their doctrines; he left behind eighty-four
disciples, of each of whom some history or story is
told, which stories are often repeated to large audiences
on festive or solemn occasions; the Tilaka mark on
the forehead of the Vallabhācāryas is described as
consisting of two perpendicular lines meeting in a
semicircle at the root of the nose and having a round
spot of red between them.) {%—Vallabhāṣṭaka-vi-%}
