{%Kanyā,%}¦ f. (the gen. pl. in Ṛg-veda is {%kanīnām%}),
a girl, a virgin, a daughter; ({%kanyāṃ dā%} or {%pra-dā%} or

{%kubja%} or {%kanya-kubja, am,%} n., N. of an ancient city
of great note, in the north of Hindūstan, situated on the
{%Kālī nadī,%} a branch of the Ganges, in the modern
district of Furruckabad. The popular spelling of the
name presents, perhaps, greater variations than that of
any place in India (e. g. <nsi>Kunnoj, Kunnouj, Kinoge,</nsi>
<nsi>Kinnoge, Kinnauj, Kanoj, Kannauj, Kunowj,</nsi>
<nsi>Canowj, Canoje, Canauj,</nsi> &c.). In antiquity this
city ranks next to Ayodhyā in Oude. It is known
to classical geography as Canogyza; but the name
applies also to its dependencies and the surrounding
district; the etymology ({%kanyā,%} a girl, and {%kubja,%}
round-shouldered or crooked) refers to a legend relat-
ing to the hundred daughters of Kuśanābha, the king
of this city, who were all rendered crooked by Vāyu
for non-compliance with his licentious desires. The
ruins of the ancient city are said to occupy a site
larger than that of London. {%—Kanyākubja-deśa,%}
