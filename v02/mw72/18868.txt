{#चेद्#}¦ {%ced%} (originally 2. {%ca + id%}), a compound
<div n="lb"/>particle, never found at the beginning of a sentence
<div n="lb"/>or verse. In the Veda it is sometimes used as a
<div n="lb"/>conjunction, like the simple {%ca,%} in the sense of ‘and,’
<div n="lb"/>‘also,’ ‘even.’ But in Vedic as well as classical
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit the most usual sense of {%ced%} is ‘if,’ ‘although,’
<div n="lb"/>‘provided that,’ ‘when,’ and in these senses it may
[Page0329-c+ 74]
<div n="lb"/>be joined with the present indicative (e. g. {%mahyaṃ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ced dadāti tat,%} if he gives that to me); or with
<div n="lb"/>the future (e. g. {%tṛṣṇāṃ cet tyakṣyati,%} if he
<div n="lb"/>shall abandon avarice); or with the conditional (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%vṛṣṭiś ced abhaviṣyat,%} if there should have been
<div n="lb"/>rain); or with the potential (e. g. {%gacchec cet,%} if
<div n="lb"/>he should go); or with the perfect (e. g. {%sa cen ma-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%māra,%} when he died); or with a participle (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%kartavyaṃ cet priyam mahyam,%} if a kindness is
<div n="lb"/>to be done to me). It should be observed that in
<div n="lb"/>the Veda the verb which depends on {%ced%} retains
<div n="lb"/>its accent.
<div n="P"/>The negative particle {%na%} may be prefixed to {%ced%}
<div n="lb"/>either immediately or separated from it (e. g. {%na%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ced vacaḥ kariṣyati%} or {%na kariṣyati ced vacaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>if he should not make a speech); and frequently the
<div n="lb"/>negative {%no%} is used in connection with {%ced,%} the
<div n="lb"/>verb being understood (e. g. {%dūram apasara no%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ced dhantavyo'si mayā,%} depart to a distance, if not,
<div n="lb"/>i. e. if thou departest not, thou art to be killed by me).
<div n="lb"/>Sometimes {%no ced = api na,%} would that not! (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%no ced evaṃ kuryāt,%} would that he did not so!).
<div n="lb"/>Rarely {%yadi%} and {%ced%} are joined together, when {%ced%}
<div n="lb"/>may be translated by ‘that is,’ ‘that is to say,’ ‘namely’
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%yadi ced rājyam avāpsyati,%} if, that is, he
<div n="lb"/>shall obtain the kingdom). In the argumentative
<div n="lb"/>writings of native commentators {%ced%} preceded by {%iti%}
<div n="lb"/>and followed by {%na%} is often placed at the end of an
<div n="lb"/>objector's statement (e. g. ‘{%Ṛg-vedam adhyemi%}’
<div n="lb"/>{%ityādi vākyam pramāṇam iti cen na,%} if it be urged
<div n="lb"/>that the text ‘I peruse the Ṛg-veda’ is a proof, no,
<div n="lb"/>it is not so). {%Atha ced,%} but if; [cf. {%ned.%}]
