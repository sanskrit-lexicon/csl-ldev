{#न#} 2¦. {%na,%} ind. a particle of negation equi-
valent to ‘not,’ ‘no,’ ‘nor,’ ‘neither’ [cf. {%no, na-%}
{%nu, na-hi, na-tarām%}], and in the Veda a particle of
comparison; it is used as a negative particle in wishing,
requesting, and commanding (e. g. {%na mā garan%}
{%nadyaḥ,%} let not the waters swallow me; {%nāvaman-%}
{%yeta kañcana,%} let him not despise any one), but not
in prohibition before an imperative, and not before
the aorist when it has lost its augment and stands for
an imperative (in both which cases {%mā,%} q. v., is used).
When joined with the potential, {%na%} may often have
the sense of ‘that not,’ ‘lest,’ ‘for fear lest’ (e. g.
{%na tvāṃ śapet,%} lest he should curse thee). In
argumentative writings {%na%} often comes at the end of
a hypothetical argument in the sense ‘not so’ (e. g.
{%nanu na kiñcin mānam iti cen na,%} now if it be
said that there is no proof, not so). Two {%nas%} are
not unfrequently used in the same sentence to intensify
an affirmation (e. g. {%na khalu na tat kariṣyāmi,%}
I will most certainly do that; {%na tu jātu na,%} most
assuredly), or any other negative particle may be
joined with {%na%} with the same effect (e. g. {%nādaṇḍyo%}
{%'sti,%} he is not to go unpunished, i. e. he must cer-
tainly be punished). When a negation has to be
repeated in successive clauses of a sentence or in
successive sentences, {%na%} may be simply repeated or
may be strengthened by one of the particles {%uta, ca,%}
{%api, cāpi, vā, athavā%} (e. g. {%nāham asyāraṇyasya%}
{%devatā na cāpy asya gireḥ,%} I am not the deity of
this forest nor of this mountain), or the negative is
not expressed in the second clause but represented
by {%vā%} or {%api vā%} or {%ca%} standing alone (e. g. {%na hṛṣ-%}
{%yati glāyati vā,%} he neither rejoices nor desponds),
or two clauses may have the negative particle and
not a third (e. g. {%na deveṣu na Yakṣeṣu mānu-%}
{%ṣeṣv api cānyeṣu tādṛg rūpavatī dṛṣṭa-%}
{%pūrvā,%} neither among gods nor Yakṣas nor other
mortals has so beautiful a female been before seen).
{%Na%} is sometimes placed before round or collective
numbers to denote a deficiency, the deficient number
being prefixed in the inst. or abl. case (e. g. {%ekayā%}
or {%ekena na viṃśatiḥ,%} not twenty by one, i. e. nine-
teen; {%pañcabhir na catvāri śatāni,%} 395). When
{%na%} is the negative of the simple idea expressed by a
word, it may be regarded as compounded with it,
and is then identical with 3. {%a,%} q. v. (e. g. {%na-vidvas,%}
unwise; {%nādhīta,%} unread; {%na-kiñcana,%} q. v.) {%Na%}
is often joined with other particles, e. g. {%na ca, na%}
{%cāpi, nāpi, nota, na vā, naiva, na caiva, nāpi%}
{%ca, na tu, na tveva, na tveva tu, na cet%} (see
{%ced%}), {%na khalu, na ha%} (after this last a verb is
said to retain its accent if used in the future with an
imperative sense, Pāṇ. VIII. 1, 31). {%Na%} is frequently
used in early Vedic composition as a particle of com-
parison = ‘like,’ ‘as,’ ‘as it were’ (e. g. {%tvā nāvaṃ%}
{%na dhīmahi,%} we meditate on thee like a boat; cf.
3. {%a,%} which also in a few instances = ‘like’); it is also
found in this sense in the later artificial poems; [cf.
