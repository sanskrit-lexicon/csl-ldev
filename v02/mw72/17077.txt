{#गन्धर्व#}¦ {%gandharva%} or sometimes in post-
Vedic writings {%gandharba, as,%} m. a Gandharva.
Though in later times the Gandharvas are regarded
as a class, yet in the Ṛg-veda rarely more than one
is mentioned; he is commonly designated as the
‘heavenly Gandharva’ ({%divyo Gandharvaḥ%}), and
sometimes named Viśvā-vasu; his habitation is the
sky, or the region of the air and the heavenly waters;
his especial duty is to guard the heavenly Soma,
which the gods obtain through his intervention. It
is obtained for the human race by Indra, who
conquers the Gandharva and takes it by force. The
heavenly Gandharva is supposed to be a good phy-
sician, because the Soma is considered as the best
medicine; possibly, however, the word Soma origin-
ally denoted not the beverage so called, but the
moon, and the heavenly Gandharva may have been
the genius or tutelary deity of the moon. It is cer-
tain that the heavenly Gandharva and the Soma are
sometimes identified. He is also regarded as one of
the genii who regulate the course of the Sun's horses;
he knows and makes known the secrets of heaven
and divine truths generally. He is the parent of the
first pair of human beings, Yama and Yamī, and has
a peculiar mystical power over women and a right
to possess them. For this reason he is invoked in
marriage ceremonies. Exstatic states of mind and
possession by evil spirits are supposed to be derived
[Page0282-a+ 79]
from the heavenly Gandharva. With Jainas he is an
attendant of the seventeenth Arhat of the present
Avasarpiṇī. The Gandharvas as a class have the same
characteristic features as the one Gandharva; they
live in the sky, guard the Soma, are governed by
Varuṇa (just as the Apsarasas are governed by Soma),
know the best medicines, regulate the course of the
asterisms (in one passage of the Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā
twenty-seven being mentioned), follow after women
and are desirous of intercourse with them. As soon
as a girl becomes marriageable, she belongs to Soma,
the Gandharvas and Agni. The wives of the Gandhar-
vas are the Apsarasas, and like them the Gandharvas
are invoked in gambling with dice; they are also
feared as evil beings together with the Rakṣasas,
Kimīdins, Piśācas, &c., amulets being worn as a
protection against them. In the Śatapatha-Brāh-
maṇa they are called the preceptors of the Ṛṣis.
In epic poetry the Gandharvas are the celestial mu-
sicians or heavenly singers who form the orchestra at
the banquets of the gods, and they belong together
with the Apsarasas to Indra's heaven, sharing also in
his battles. In the more systematic mythology the
Gandharvas constitute one of the classes into which
the higher creation is divided (e. g. gods, manes,
Gandharvas; or gods, Asuras, Gandharvas, men, &c.).
In one passage of the Taittirīya-Āraṇyaka eleven
classes of Gandharvas are mentioned. The chief or
leader of the Gandharvas is named Citra-ratha. They
are sometimes called the creatures of Prajāpati or
Brahmā. With Jainas the Gandharvas constitute one
of the eight classes of the Vyantaras. The following
meanings are also given to the word {%gandharva%} — 
a singer; the Koïl or black cuckoo; the soul after
death, and previous to its being born again (cor-
responding in some respects to the western notion
of a ghost); a horse; the sun; a sage, a pious man;
a kind of deer, according to some, the musk deer;
({%ī%}), f. Gandharvī, a daughter of Su-rabhi and mother
of the race of horses; [cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">κένταυρος.</lang>] {%—Gan-%}
