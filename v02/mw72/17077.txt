{#गन्धर्व#}¦ {%gandharva%} or sometimes in post-
<div n="lb"/>Vedic writings {%gandharba, as,%} m. a Gandharva.
<div n="lb"/>Though in later times the Gandharvas are regarded
<div n="lb"/>as a class, yet in the Ṛg-veda rarely more than one
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned; he is commonly designated as the
<div n="lb"/>‘heavenly Gandharva’ ({%divyo Gandharvaḥ%}), and
<div n="lb"/>sometimes named Viśvā-vasu; his habitation is the
<div n="lb"/>sky, or the region of the air and the heavenly waters;
<div n="lb"/>his especial duty is to guard the heavenly Soma,
<div n="lb"/>which the gods obtain through his intervention. It
<div n="lb"/>is obtained for the human race by Indra, who
<div n="lb"/>conquers the Gandharva and takes it by force. The
<div n="lb"/>heavenly Gandharva is supposed to be a good phy-
<div n="lb"/>sician, because the Soma is considered as the best
<div n="lb"/>medicine; possibly, however, the word Soma origin-
<div n="lb"/>ally denoted not the beverage so called, but the
<div n="lb"/>moon, and the heavenly Gandharva may have been
<div n="lb"/>the genius or tutelary deity of the moon. It is cer-
<div n="lb"/>tain that the heavenly Gandharva and the Soma are
<div n="lb"/>sometimes identified. He is also regarded as one of
<div n="lb"/>the genii who regulate the course of the Sun's horses;
<div n="lb"/>he knows and makes known the secrets of heaven
<div n="lb"/>and divine truths generally. He is the parent of the
<div n="lb"/>first pair of human beings, Yama and Yamī, and has
<div n="lb"/>a peculiar mystical power over women and a right
<div n="lb"/>to possess them. For this reason he is invoked in
<div n="lb"/>marriage ceremonies. Exstatic states of mind and
<div n="lb"/>possession by evil spirits are supposed to be derived
[Page0282-a+ 79]
<div n="lb"/>from the heavenly Gandharva. With Jainas he is an
<div n="lb"/>attendant of the seventeenth Arhat of the present
<div n="lb"/>Avasarpiṇī. The Gandharvas as a class have the same
<div n="lb"/>characteristic features as the one Gandharva; they
<div n="lb"/>live in the sky, guard the Soma, are governed by
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa (just as the Apsarasas are governed by Soma),
<div n="lb"/>know the best medicines, regulate the course of the
<div n="lb"/>asterisms (in one passage of the Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā
<div n="lb"/>twenty-seven being mentioned), follow after women
<div n="lb"/>and are desirous of intercourse with them. As soon
<div n="lb"/>as a girl becomes marriageable, she belongs to Soma,
<div n="lb"/>the Gandharvas and Agni. The wives of the Gandhar-
<div n="lb"/>vas are the Apsarasas, and like them the Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>are invoked in gambling with dice; they are also
<div n="lb"/>feared as evil beings together with the Rakṣasas,
<div n="lb"/>Kimīdins, Piśācas, &c., amulets being worn as a
<div n="lb"/>protection against them. In the Śatapatha-Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa they are called the preceptors of the Ṛṣis.
<div n="lb"/>In epic poetry the Gandharvas are the celestial mu-
<div n="lb"/>sicians or heavenly singers who form the orchestra at
<div n="lb"/>the banquets of the gods, and they belong together
<div n="lb"/>with the Apsarasas to Indra's heaven, sharing also in
<div n="lb"/>his battles. In the more systematic mythology the
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas constitute one of the classes into which
<div n="lb"/>the higher creation is divided (e. g. gods, manes,
<div n="lb"/>Gandharvas; or gods, Asuras, Gandharvas, men, &c.).
<div n="lb"/>In one passage of the Taittirīya-Āraṇyaka eleven
<div n="lb"/>classes of Gandharvas are mentioned. The chief or
<div n="lb"/>leader of the Gandharvas is named Citra-ratha. They
<div n="lb"/>are sometimes called the creatures of Prajāpati or
<div n="lb"/>Brahmā. With Jainas the Gandharvas constitute one
<div n="lb"/>of the eight classes of the Vyantaras. The following
<div n="lb"/>meanings are also given to the word {%gandharva%} — 
<div n="lb"/>a singer; the Koïl or black cuckoo; the soul after
<div n="lb"/>death, and previous to its being born again (cor-
<div n="lb"/>responding in some respects to the western notion
<div n="lb"/>of a ghost); a horse; the sun; a sage, a pious man;
<div n="lb"/>a kind of deer, according to some, the musk deer;
<div n="lb"/>({%ī%}), f. Gandharvī, a daughter of Su-rabhi and mother
<div n="lb"/>of the race of horses; [cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">κένταυρος.</lang>] {%—Gan-%}
