{%Kim%}¦ is very frequently connected with other parti-
cles, as follows: {%kim aṅga,%} wherefore then? {%atha%}
{%kim,%} how else? surely; {%kim api,%} somewhat, to a
considerable extent, rather, much more, still further;
{%kim iti,%} why ? (see {%iti%}); {%kimu%} or {%kimuta,%} how
much more ? how much less? {%kiṃ kila,%} what a
pity! (expressing dissatisfaction); {%kiñca,%} moreover,
further; {%kiñ-cana%} (originally negative = ‘in no way’),
to a certain degree, a little; {%kiñcit,%} somewhat, a little;
{%kiṃ tarhi,%} how then ? but, however; {%kintu,%} but,
however, nevertheless (bearing the same relation to {%tu%}
that {%kiñca%} bears to {%ca%}); {%kin-nu,%} whether indeed? (a
stronger interrogative than {%kim%} alone); how much
more? how much less? {%kin nu khalu,%} how possibly?
(a still stronger interrogative); {%kim punar,%} how
much more ? how much less? {%kiṃ vā,%} whether?
or whether ? or, (often a mere particle of interroga-
tion); {%kiṃ svit,%} whether ? how? (a mere particle of
interrogation like the last).
