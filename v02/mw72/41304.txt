{%Varuṇa, as,%}¦ m. ‘Universal encompasser, All-en-
veloper, ‘N. of an Āditya, (as a Vedic deity com-
monly associated with Mitra and presiding over the
night as Mitra over the day [see 1. {%mitra%}], but
often celebrated separately, whereas Mitra is rarely
invoked alone; Varuṇa is one of the oldest of the
Vedic gods, corresponding in name and partly in
character to the <lang n="greek">Οὐρανός</lang> of the Greeks, and is
often regarded as the supreme deity, being then
styled ‘king of the gods’ or ‘king of both gods and
men’ or ‘king of the universe;’ no other deity has
such grand attributes and functions assigned to him;
he is described as fashioning and upholding heaven
and earth, as possessing extraordinary power and
wisdom called {%māyā,%} as sending his spies or messen-
gers throughout both worlds, as numbering the very
winkings of men's eyes, as hating falsehood, as
seizing transgressors with his {%pāśa%} or noose, as in-
flicting diseases, especially dropsy, as pardoning sin,
as the guardian of immortality; though generally
associated with Mitra, he is also invoked in the Veda
together with Indra, and in later Vedic literature
together with Agni, with Yama, and with Viṣṇu;
in Ṛg-veda IV. 1, 2. he is even called the brother
of Agni; though not generally regarded in the Veda
as a god of the ocean, yet he is often connected with
the waters, especially the waters of the atmosphere
or firmament, and in one place [Ṛg-veda VII. 64, 2]
is called with Mitra {%Sindhu-pati,%} ‘lord of the sea or
of rivers;’ hence in the later mythology he became
a kind of Neptune, and is there best known in his
character of god of the ocean; in the Mahā-bhārata
Varuṇa is said to be a son of Kardama and father of
Puṣkara, and is also variously represented as one
of the Deva-gandharvas, as a Nāga, as a king of the
Nāgas, and as an Asura; he is the regent of the
western quarter [cf. {%loka-pāla%}] and of the Nakṣatra
Śata-bhiṣaj; the Jainas consider Varuṇa as a servant
of the twentieth Arhat of the present Ava-sarpiṇī);
