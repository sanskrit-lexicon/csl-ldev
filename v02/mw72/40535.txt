{#लुक्#} 2¦. {%luk%} (probably fr. Pass. of rt. {%luñc;%}
cf. {%luc%} below; the loc. c. however is {%luki,%} not {%luci%}),
a technical term or symbol in grammar to express
‘the dropping out’ or ‘disappearance’ of Pratyayas
or affixes; (it is properly regarded as a substitute for
an affix, preventing the appearance of any other affix
in its place, and neutralizing the effect which this affix
would have had on the base; the symbols {%luk, lup,%}
and {%ślu%} are distinguished from {%lopa,%} q. v., and are
called {%lu-mat,%} as containing the syllable {%lu.%})
