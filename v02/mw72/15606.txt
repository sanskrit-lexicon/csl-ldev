{%Kṛtvas,%}¦ ind. at the end of a numeral or numeral
<div n="lb"/>adjective, = fold, times (e. g. {%daśa-kṛtvas,%} ten times;
<div n="lb"/>{%bahu-kṛtvas,%} many times; {%pañca-kṛtvas,%} five-fold).
<div n="lb"/>In the earlier language {%kṛtvas%} is used as a separate
<div n="lb"/>word, but native grammarians regard it only as an
<div n="lb"/>affix, and it is so used in classical Sanskrit; it was
<div n="lb"/>perhaps originally an acc. plur. fr. a noun {%kṛtu,%}
<div n="lb"/>formed by the affix {%tu%} fr. the root 1. {%kṛ;%} [cf. also
<div n="lb"/>{%kṛt%} in {%sakṛt.%}]
