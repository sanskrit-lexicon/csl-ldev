{#उ#} 3¦. {%u,%} ind. an enclitic copula, used fre-
quently in the Vedas; (as a particle implying re-
striction and antithesis, generally after pronominals,
prepositions, particles, and before {%nu%} and {%su,%} equiva-
lent to) and, also, further; on the other hand (espe-
cially in connection with a relative, e. g. {%ya u,%} he on
the contrary who &c.).
<div n="P"/>This particle may serve to give emphasis, like {%id%}
and {%eva,%} especially after prepositions or demonstrative
pronouns, in conjunction with {%nu, vai, hi, cid,%} &c.
(e. g. {%ayam u vām purutamo johavīmi,%} I this very
person invoke you constantly). It is especially used in
the figure of speech called Anaphora, and particularly
when the pronouns are repeated (e. g. {%tam u stuṣa%}
{%Indram tam gṛṇīṣe,%} him I praise, Indra, him
I sing). It may be used in drawing a conclusion, like
the English ‘now’ (e. g. {%tad u tathā na kuryāt,%}
that now he should not do in such a manner), and
is frequently found in interrogative sentences (e. g. {%ka%}
{%u tac ciketa,%} who, I ask, should know that ?).
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini calls this particle {%uñ%} to distinguish it from
the interrogative {%u.%} In the Pada-pāṭha it is written
{%ūṃ.%}
<div n="P"/>In the classical language {%u%} occurs only after {%atha,%}
{%na,%} and {%kim,%} with a slight modification of the sense,
and often only as an expletive (see {%kim%}); {%u-u%} or
{%u-uta,%} on the one hand — on the other hand; partly — 
partly; as well — as.
