<div n="lb"/>ties, a son of either Dharmanetra, or of Netra and
<div n="lb"/>grandson of Dharma, or of Kratha, or of Vidarbha

<div n="lb"/>named Śūra, who gave her to his childless cousin
<div n="lb"/>Kunti or Kunti-bhoja, by whom she was adopted.
<div n="lb"/>She afterwards became one of the two wives of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṇḍu. (On one occasion before her marriage she
<div n="lb"/>paid such respect to the powerful sage Durvāsas that
<div n="lb"/>he taught her an incantation or charm, by virtue of
<div n="lb"/>which she was to have a child by any god she liked
<div n="lb"/>to invoke. Out of curiosity she invoked the Sun,
<div n="lb"/>by whom she had a child, cf. {%karṇa;%} but the Sun
<div n="lb"/>afterwards restored to her her maidenhood. Soon
<div n="lb"/>after his marriage Pāṇḍu retired to the woods to
<div n="lb"/>indulge his passion for hunting. There he killed a
<div n="lb"/>male and female deer, who turned out to be a Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>and his wife in the form of these animals. The sage
<div n="lb"/>cursed Pāṇḍu and predicted that he would die in the
<div n="lb"/>embrace of one of his wives. Hence Pāṇḍu lived
<div n="lb"/>apart from Kunti, but with his approval she made
<div n="lb"/>use of her charm and had three sons, Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb"/>Bhīma, and Arjuna, by the three deities Dharma,
<div n="lb"/>Vāyu, and Indra respectively; cf. {%mādrī%}); N. of a
