{#वा#} 1¦. {%vā,%} ind. (excluded, like the Lat. <nsi>ve,</nsi>
from the first place in a sentence, and generally com-
ing immediately after the word to which it refers),
as, like, so (not commonly used in this sense); either,
or, whether; either — or not, i. e. optionally, (in
grammar the word {%vā%} is placed after a rule to
denote its being optional); else; or if, but if; but;
only, no other; indeed, truly, even, very (in as-
severation or confirmation); and (as a conjunction);
{%vā%} is also sometimes used as an expletive; it is also
somewhat pleonastically or perhaps emphatically added
to an interrogative pronoun especially when followed
by the negative {%na%} (e. g. {%ko vā na, ke vā na,%} which
may be translated by ‘very on,’ ‘all’); {%vā — vā,%}
either — or; on the one side — on the other; {%atha vā,%}
or else; or, or if, or rather, but, certainly, see {%atha;%}
{%na vā,%} or not; {%yadi vā,%} or if, or whether, whether,
whether or no, see under {%yadi,%} p. 808; {%yad vā,%}
or, or else; {%kiṃ vā,%} whether? {%kiṃ vā — na vā,%} is
it — or not? see under {%kim;%} [cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">ἤ;</lang> Lat. <nsi>ve.</nsi>]
