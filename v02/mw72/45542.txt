N. of a celebrated sage and author (often called Veda-
vyāsa and regarded as the original arranger of the
Vedas &c. and founder of the Vedānta philosophy
[see {%vedānta%}]; he was the son of the sage Parāśara
and Satyavatī, who afterwards, as the wife of Śāntanu,
gave birth to Vicitra-vīrya and Bhīṣma; he was
therefore half-brother of these latter; Parāśara met
Satyavatī, when quite a girl, as he was crossing the
river Jumnā; their child Vyāsa was called Kṛṣṇa
from his dark complexion, and Dvaipāyana because
he was brought forth by Satyavatī on a Dvīpa or
island in the Jumnā; when grown up he retired to
the wilderness to lead the life of a hermit, but at
his mother's request returned to become the husband
of Vicitra-vīrya's two childless widows, by whom he
was the father of the blind Dhṛta-rāṣṭra and of
Pāṇḍu; he was also the father of Vidura by a slave
girl [see {%vidura,%} p. 918] and of Śuka, the supposed
narrator of the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa: the Viṣṇu-Pu-
rāṇa III. 3. enumerates twenty-eight Vyāsas or
arrangers of the Vedas in the twenty-eight Dvāpara
ages of the Vaivasvata Manv-antara; the first Vyāsa
is said to have been Svayam-bhū or Brahmā himself,
and the twenty-eighth was Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana: the
name Vyāsa seems to have been given to any great
compiler or author, and this title is conferred not
only on the arranger of the Vedas and the Purāṇas,
but also on the compiler of the Mahā-bhārata, the
Brahma-sūtra of the Vedānta philosophy, a Dharma-
śāstra, the Yoga-sūtra-bhāṣya, the Vakra-tuṇḍa-
stotra, the Vakra-tuṇḍāṣṭaka hymns, and the Śiva-
dhanur-veda: the following are synonyms for Vyāsa,
Vādarāyaṇa or Bādarāyaṇa, Dvaipāyana, Kṛṣṇa-
