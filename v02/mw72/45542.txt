<div n="lb"/>and Satyavatī, who afterwards, as the wife of Śāntanu,
<div n="lb"/>gave birth to Vicitra-vīrya and Bhīṣma; he was
<div n="lb"/>therefore half-brother of these latter; Parāśara met
<div n="lb"/>Satyavatī, when quite a girl, as he was crossing the
<div n="lb"/>river Jumnā; their child Vyāsa was called Kṛṣṇa

<div n="lb"/>is said to have been Svayam-bhū or Brahmā himself,
<div n="lb"/>and the twenty-eighth was Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana: the
