was built for the reception of the Pāṇḍava princes in
Vāraṇāvata by Purocana, at the instigation of Dur-

they were asleep after a festival. Warned, however,
by Vidura, they discovered the dangerous character of
their abode, and dug an underground passage by
which to escape from the interior. Next having
invited an outcaste woman with her five sons to a
feast, they first stupefied them with wine, and then
having burnt Purocana in his own house, set fire to
the house of lac and, leaving the charred bodies of
the woman and her sons inside, escaped by the under-
ground passage; see Mahā-bh. I. 5864.) {%—Jatu- %}
