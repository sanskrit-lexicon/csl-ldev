{#शैव#}¦ {%śaiva, as, ī, am%} (fr. {%śiva%}), relating or
belonging to the god Śiva; ({%as%}), m. ‘a worshipper
or follower of Śiva,’ N. of one of the three great
divisions of modern Hindū sects, (the other two
being the Vaiṣṇavas and Śāktas, see {%vaiṣṇava,%}
{%śākta;%} the Śaivas believe in the superiority of Śiva
to the other gods of the Tri-mūrti, and identify him
with the Supreme Being as the destroying principle
as well as source and essence of the whole universe;
the temples dedicated to him in his popular symbol
of the Liṅga [see {%śiva%}] are very numerous every-
where, but the doctrines of the Śaivas as represented
by their great teachers, such as Śaṅkara, are too
philosophical for the majority of the people, who are
more attracted by Viṣṇu, especially in his forms
of Kṛṣṇa and Rāma: various divisions of Śaiva
sects have prevailed at different times, the earlier
divisions being those of the Raudras who have
the Tri-śūla or trident marked on their foreheads,
the Ugras who have the Ḍamaru or drum on their
arms, the Bhāktas who have the Liṅga on their
foreheads, the Jaṅgamas who have that symbol on
their heads, and the Pāśupatas who have it marked
on other parts of their bodies; the more modern
divisions being the Daṇḍins or mendicant staff-
bearers, including the Daś-nāmī-daṇḍins [cf. {%śaṅka-%}
{%rācārya%}], the Yogins who cultivate absorption into
Śiva by suppression of breathing, fixing of the eyes,
and eighty-four different attitudes, the Jaṅgamas or
Liṅgavats, the Parama-haṃsas, the Aghorins, the
Ūrdhva-bāhus, the Ākāśa-mukhins, and many others);
a particular religious rite in honour of Durgā (con-
sisting of devout meditation and prostration of the
body); the thorn-apple; another plant or tree, {%=%}
