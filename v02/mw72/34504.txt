Guhyakas &c., or to the spirits of trees, waters &c.;

omitted however in his arrogance to make the usual
offerings to the deities, Viṣṇu resolved to mortify
his pride, and assumed the form of a Vāmana or
dwarf, as the son of Kaśyapa and Aditi and younger
brother of Indra, in which shape he appeared before
Bali and asked as much land as he could pace in
three steps; this Bali granted, and Viṣṇu expanding
himself deprived him in two steps of heaven and
earth, but in consideration of his virtues left Pātāla
or the lower regions still in his dominion; cf. {%tri-%}
