{#यद्#}¦ {%yad, yas, yā, yad%} (the actual base of
<div n="lb"/>this relative pronoun is {%ya,%} except in compounds
<div n="lb"/>and in the derivative {%yadīya;%} its proper correlative
<div n="lb"/>is {%tad,%} q. v., but other demonstrative pronouns and
<div n="lb"/>pronominals, such as {%etad, idam, adas, tādṛśa,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%īdṛśa, sarva,%} often occur in the correlative clauses;
<div n="lb"/>see 3. {%ya%}), who, which, what, that, whoever, which-
<div n="lb"/>ever, whatever, any. The relative {%yad%} often pre-
<div n="lb"/>cedes the noun to which it refers, this noun being
<div n="lb"/>either put in the same case with the relative or
<div n="lb"/>joined with the demonstrative (e. g. {%yasya narasya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%buddhiḥ sa balavān%} or {%yasya buddhiḥ sa naro%}
<div n="lb"/>{%balavān,%} of whatever man there is intellect he is
<div n="lb"/>strong); sometimes the relative stands alone, an
<div n="lb"/>antecedent noun or pronoun being understood from
<div n="lb"/>which it takes its gender and number (e. g. {%dha-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%nena kiṃ yo na dadāti,%} what is the use of wealth
<div n="lb"/>[to him] who does not give?); or the relative itself
<div n="lb"/>may be dropped (e. g. {%na karoty a-kāryaṃ tam%}
<div n="lb"/>{%āryam āhuḥ,%} they call him honourable [who] does
<div n="lb"/>nothing improper to be done). Sometimes the rela-
<div n="lb"/>tive {%yad,%} with or without its demonstrative, appears
<div n="lb"/>to be used redundantly to eke out the metre, or
<div n="lb"/>perhaps to give force to the noun with which it is
<div n="lb"/>connected, even the neut. sing. being occasionally
<div n="lb"/>thus used in connection with words of a different
<div n="lb"/>gender and number, and the relative being itself
<div n="lb"/>almost untranslatable (e. g. {%yan maraṇaṃ so 'sya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%viśrāmaḥ,%} that very death is his rest; {%andho jaḍaḥ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%pīṭha-sarpī saptatyā sthaviraś-ca yaḥ,%} a blind
<div n="lb"/>man, an idiot, a cripple, and a man seventy years
<div n="lb"/>old; {%yat kṣāntiḥ samaye śrutiḥ Śiva Śivety-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%uktir mano-nirvṛtir asau mukti-mārge sthitiḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>forbearance, obedience to ordinances, saying ‘Śiva,
<div n="lb"/>Śiva,’ contentment of mind, this is continuance on the
<div n="lb"/>road of emancipation); and sometimes this redundant
<div n="lb"/>or emphatic use of {%yad%} causes a sudden change of
<div n="lb"/>construction from accusative to nominative (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%apoheta rasān aśmano lavaṇaṃ caiva paśavo%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ye ca,%} he should avoid liquids, stones, and salt, and
<div n="lb"/>all cattle). The relative {%yad%} is often repeated to
<div n="lb"/>express ‘whoever,’ ‘whatever,’ ‘whichever,’ &c. (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%yo yaḥ,%} whatever man; {%yā yā,%} whatever woman;
<div n="lb"/>{%yad yad,%} whatever thing; {%yo yo yāvatithaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>whichever [is] how many soever degrees, i. e. in
[Page0808-a+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>proportion as each of which is advanced in the series);
<div n="lb"/>or the repetition of {%yad%} may be caused by a kind of
<div n="lb"/>attraction, the second relative being equivalent to
<div n="lb"/>an indefinite pronoun (e. g. {%yo yasya bhāvaḥ syāt,%}
<div n="lb"/>whatever may be the disposition of any one; {%yad%}
<div n="lb"/>{%rocate yasmai,%} whatever is pleasing to any one);
<div n="lb"/>or the relative may be used to express similar inde-
<div n="lb"/>finite meanings when joined with {%kaścit, kaścana,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ko 'pi, kaśca, ko vā%} (e. g. {%yaḥ kaścit%} or {%yaḥ-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kaścana,%} whosoever; {%yat kiñcit%} or {%yat kiñca,%}
<div n="lb"/>whatsoever; {%yena kenāpy upāyena,%} by any means
<div n="lb"/>whatsoever; {%yāni kāni ca mitrāṇi,%} any friends
<div n="lb"/>whatsoever; {%yasmai kasmai ca,%} to any one what-
<div n="lb"/>ever; {%yasmin kasmin vā deśe,%} in any country
<div n="lb"/>whatever); or even with a demonstrative pronoun
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%yasmai tasmai,%} to any one whatever; {%yas-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%māt tasmāt,%} from any one, from this or that per-
<div n="lb"/>son; {%yena tena karmaṇā,%} by any act whatever);
<div n="lb"/>or sometimes the relative {%yad%} is used alone with the
<div n="lb"/>indefinite sense ‘any one,’ &c. (e. g. {%striyaṃ spṛ-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śed yaḥ saṅgrahaṇaṃ smṛtam,%} should any one
<div n="lb"/>touch a woman it is called an adulterous act; {%yām%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ajāṃ vṛko hanyāt pāle tat kilviṣam bhavet,%}
<div n="lb"/>if a wolf kill any she-goat the blame must be on the
<div n="lb"/>keeper). {%Yad%} is also connected in a peculiar manner
<div n="lb"/>with the personal pronouns, which, when placed
<div n="lb"/>immediately after the relative, appear to derive force
<div n="lb"/>or emphasis from this juxtaposition (e. g. {%yo 'ham,%}
<div n="lb"/>I that very person who; {%yas tvam,%} thou that very
<div n="lb"/>one who, &c.). {%Yad%} in the neut. sing. is used as
<div n="lb"/>an adverbial conjunction equivalent to ‘for which
<div n="lb"/>reason,’ ‘on which account,’ ‘wherefore,’ ‘since,’
<div n="lb"/>‘as,’ ‘because,’ ‘when,’ ‘while,’ ‘if,’ ‘with regard
<div n="lb"/>to,’ ‘as to,’ &c.; or still oftener as a simple con-
<div n="lb"/>junction meaning ‘that,’ especially after the verbs of
<div n="lb"/>saying, hearing, &c., or such words as {%kāma, yukta,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%āścarya,%} &c. (e. g. {%dhīvarair uktaṃ yat — ,%} it was
<div n="lb"/>said by the fishermen that — ; {%śrutaṃ tvayā yat — ,%}
<div n="lb"/>it has been heard by thee that — ; {%āścaryaṃ yat — ,%}
<div n="lb"/>it is a wonder that — ); frequently followed by a verb
<div n="lb"/>in the indicative (e. g. {%ayaṃ nūtano nyāyo yad%}
<div n="lb"/>{%arātiṃ hatvā santāpaḥ kriyate,%} this is a new
<div n="lb"/>doctrine that having killed an enemy remorse is expe-
<div n="lb"/>rienced); less frequently in the potential (e. g. {%eṣa%}
<div n="lb"/>{%me kāmo yat sa rājyam āpnuyāt,%} this is my desire
<div n="lb"/>that he may obtain the kingdom); {%yad api,%} although;
<div n="lb"/>{%yac-ca,%} that (according to Pāṇ. III. 3, 148, with
<div n="lb"/>potential, after expressions of impossibility, disbelief,
<div n="lb"/>hope, disregard, reproach, and wonder, e. g. {%na%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śrad-dadhe yac-ca tatra-bhavān vṛṣalaṃ yā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%jayet,%} I do not believe that your Highness will allow
<div n="lb"/>a Śūdra to sacrifice); {%yad vā,%} or, or else, whether,
<div n="lb"/>(in the writings of commentators {%yad vā%} generally
<div n="lb"/>occurs when an alternative reading or meaning is
<div n="lb"/>proposed, and may commonly be translated by ‘or,’
<div n="lb"/>‘or else’): in philosophical writings {%yaḥ%} is said to
<div n="lb"/>be used as a synonymn for {%puruṣaḥ:%} [cf. Zend
