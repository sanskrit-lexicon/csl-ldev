{#यद्#}¦ {%yad, yas, yā, yad%} (the actual base of
this relative pronoun is {%ya,%} except in compounds
and in the derivative {%yadīya;%} its proper correlative
is {%tad,%} q. v., but other demonstrative pronouns and
pronominals, such as {%etad, idam, adas, tādṛśa,%}
{%īdṛśa, sarva,%} often occur in the correlative clauses;
see 3. {%ya%}), who, which, what, that, whoever, which-
ever, whatever, any. The relative {%yad%} often pre-
cedes the noun to which it refers, this noun being
either put in the same case with the relative or
joined with the demonstrative (e. g. {%yasya narasya%}
{%buddhiḥ sa balavān%} or {%yasya buddhiḥ sa naro%}
{%balavān,%} of whatever man there is intellect he is
strong); sometimes the relative stands alone, an
antecedent noun or pronoun being understood from
which it takes its gender and number (e. g. {%dha-%}
{%nena kiṃ yo na dadāti,%} what is the use of wealth
[to him] who does not give?); or the relative itself
may be dropped (e. g. {%na karoty a-kāryaṃ tam%}
{%āryam āhuḥ,%} they call him honourable [who] does
nothing improper to be done). Sometimes the rela-
tive {%yad,%} with or without its demonstrative, appears
to be used redundantly to eke out the metre, or
perhaps to give force to the noun with which it is
connected, even the neut. sing. being occasionally
thus used in connection with words of a different
gender and number, and the relative being itself
almost untranslatable (e. g. {%yan maraṇaṃ so 'sya%}
{%viśrāmaḥ,%} that very death is his rest; {%andho jaḍaḥ%}
{%pīṭha-sarpī saptatyā sthaviraś-ca yaḥ,%} a blind
man, an idiot, a cripple, and a man seventy years
old; {%yat kṣāntiḥ samaye śrutiḥ Śiva Śivety-%}
{%uktir mano-nirvṛtir asau mukti-mārge sthitiḥ,%}
forbearance, obedience to ordinances, saying ‘Śiva,
Śiva,’ contentment of mind, this is continuance on the
road of emancipation); and sometimes this redundant
or emphatic use of {%yad%} causes a sudden change of
construction from accusative to nominative (e. g.
{%apoheta rasān aśmano lavaṇaṃ caiva paśavo%}
{%ye ca,%} he should avoid liquids, stones, and salt, and
all cattle). The relative {%yad%} is often repeated to
express ‘whoever,’ ‘whatever,’ ‘whichever,’ &c. (e. g.
{%yo yaḥ,%} whatever man; {%yā yā,%} whatever woman;
{%yad yad,%} whatever thing; {%yo yo yāvatithaḥ,%}
whichever [is] how many soever degrees, i. e. in
[Page0808-a+ 81]
proportion as each of which is advanced in the series);
or the repetition of {%yad%} may be caused by a kind of
attraction, the second relative being equivalent to
an indefinite pronoun (e. g. {%yo yasya bhāvaḥ syāt,%}
whatever may be the disposition of any one; {%yad%}
{%rocate yasmai,%} whatever is pleasing to any one);
or the relative may be used to express similar inde-
finite meanings when joined with {%kaścit, kaścana,%}
{%ko 'pi, kaśca, ko vā%} (e. g. {%yaḥ kaścit%} or {%yaḥ-%}
{%kaścana,%} whosoever; {%yat kiñcit%} or {%yat kiñca,%}
whatsoever; {%yena kenāpy upāyena,%} by any means
whatsoever; {%yāni kāni ca mitrāṇi,%} any friends
whatsoever; {%yasmai kasmai ca,%} to any one what-
ever; {%yasmin kasmin vā deśe,%} in any country
whatever); or even with a demonstrative pronoun
(e. g. {%yasmai tasmai,%} to any one whatever; {%yas-%}
{%māt tasmāt,%} from any one, from this or that per-
son; {%yena tena karmaṇā,%} by any act whatever);
or sometimes the relative {%yad%} is used alone with the
indefinite sense ‘any one,’ &c. (e. g. {%striyaṃ spṛ-%}
{%śed yaḥ saṅgrahaṇaṃ smṛtam,%} should any one
touch a woman it is called an adulterous act; {%yām%}
{%ajāṃ vṛko hanyāt pāle tat kilviṣam bhavet,%}
if a wolf kill any she-goat the blame must be on the
keeper). {%Yad%} is also connected in a peculiar manner
with the personal pronouns, which, when placed
immediately after the relative, appear to derive force
or emphasis from this juxtaposition (e. g. {%yo 'ham,%}
I that very person who; {%yas tvam,%} thou that very
one who, &c.). {%Yad%} in the neut. sing. is used as
an adverbial conjunction equivalent to ‘for which
reason,’ ‘on which account,’ ‘wherefore,’ ‘since,’
‘as,’ ‘because,’ ‘when,’ ‘while,’ ‘if,’ ‘with regard
to,’ ‘as to,’ &c.; or still oftener as a simple con-
junction meaning ‘that,’ especially after the verbs of
saying, hearing, &c., or such words as {%kāma, yukta,%}
{%āścarya,%} &c. (e. g. {%dhīvarair uktaṃ yat — ,%} it was
said by the fishermen that — ; {%śrutaṃ tvayā yat — ,%}
it has been heard by thee that — ; {%āścaryaṃ yat — ,%}
it is a wonder that — ); frequently followed by a verb
in the indicative (e. g. {%ayaṃ nūtano nyāyo yad%}
{%arātiṃ hatvā santāpaḥ kriyate,%} this is a new
doctrine that having killed an enemy remorse is expe-
rienced); less frequently in the potential (e. g. {%eṣa%}
{%me kāmo yat sa rājyam āpnuyāt,%} this is my desire
that he may obtain the kingdom); {%yad api,%} although;
{%yac-ca,%} that (according to Pāṇ. III. 3, 148, with
potential, after expressions of impossibility, disbelief,
hope, disregard, reproach, and wonder, e. g. {%na%}
{%śrad-dadhe yac-ca tatra-bhavān vṛṣalaṃ yā-%}
{%jayet,%} I do not believe that your Highness will allow
a Śūdra to sacrifice); {%yad vā,%} or, or else, whether,
(in the writings of commentators {%yad vā%} generally
occurs when an alternative reading or meaning is
proposed, and may commonly be translated by ‘or,’
‘or else’): in philosophical writings {%yaḥ%} is said to
be used as a synonymn for {%puruṣaḥ:%} [cf. Zend
