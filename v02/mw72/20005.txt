in the hills north-east of the Pañjāb to which pilgrim-
ages are made; the soil abounds with carburetted
hydrogen gas which takes fire upon coming in con-
tact with the external air. According to the legend,
the flame proceeds from the fire which the wife of
Śiva created and in which she burned herself. Śiva
finding that this flame was about to consume the
world, buried it in the hollow of the mountain.

fell at this place. There is a similar volcanic region
in Chinese Tartary where fire is produced by digging
into the earth.) {%—Jvālā-liṅga, am,%} n. ‘flame-liṅga,’
