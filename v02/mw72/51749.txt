{#साङ्ख्य#}¦ {%sāṅkhya, as, ā, am,%} (fr. {%saṅ-khyā%}),
relating to number or calculation, reckoning up, cal-
culating, enumerating, deliberating, reasoning; ra-
tional, discriminative; ({%as, am%}), m. n., N. of one
of the three great divisions of Hindū philosophy,
(ascribed to the sage Kapila, q. v., and so called as
‘reckoning up’ or ‘enumerating’ twenty-five Tat-
tvas or true principles, its object being to effect the
final liberation of the twenty-fifth Tattva [Puruṣa,
the Soul] from the fetters of the phenomenal crea-
tion by conveying the correct knowledge of the
twenty-four other Tattvas, and rightly discriminating
the Soul from them; these twenty-four principles
are divided into eight Prakṛtis or Producers and six-
teen Vikāras or Productions; the eight Producers
start from a Mūla-prakṛti or original Producer
[variously called Pradhāna, ‘chief one;’ A-vyakta,
‘unevolved;’ Brahman, ‘supreme;’ Māyā, ‘power
of illusion;’ Bahu-dhānaka, ‘much-containing’],
[Page1103-b+ 81]
which is emphatically <nsi>the</nsi> Prakṛti, ‘First-producer,’ or
‘Originant,’ being a kind of primordial germ whence
all the twenty-three remaining Tattvas are evolved;
its first production is the 2nd Tattva, viz. Buddhi,
Intellect [sometimes called {%Mahat%} from its being
the great source of the two other internal organs
or instruments, Ahaṅkāra and Manas, which are
both modifications of it]; 3rd in order comes Ahaṅ-
kāra, ‘the I-making’ principle or sense of indi-
viduality; 4th come the five Tan-mātras or subtile
elementary particles out of which the five grosser
elements are evolved; the preceding eight principles
constitute the Producers, [all but the first being of
course in one sense also Productions]; then follow,
as proceeding from the Tan-mātras, the five Sthūla-
bhūtas or grosser elements [also called Mahā-bhūta],
viz. a. {%ākāśa,%} space or ether, having the Guṇa or
property of sound [{%śabda%}], which is the Viṣaya
or object of apprehension for the corresponding
Indriya or organ, the Ear; b. {%vāyu,%} air, having the
Guṇa or property of tangibility or touch [{%sparśa%}],
which is the Viṣaya for the Skin; c. {%tejas%} or
{%jyotis,%} fire or light, having the property of form or
colour [{%rūpa%}], which is the Viṣaya for the Eye;
d. {%āpas,%} water, having the property of savour or
taste [{%rasa%}], which is the Viṣaya for the Tongue;
e. {%pṛthivī%} or {%bhūmi,%} earth, having the property of
odour or smell [{%gandha%}], which is the Viṣaya for
the Nose, [see {%guṇa%}]; each of these elements after
the first having also the Guṇa or Guṇas of the pre-
ceding besides its own, and these Guṇas being some-
times identified with the Tan-mātras; then follow
the eleven organs, produced like the Tan-mātras from
the 3rd Tattva Ahaṅkāra, forming with them a
class of sixteen [{%ṣoḍaśakaḥ%}]; these eleven organs
are the five above-named Buddhīndriyāṇi or organs
of sense, viz. ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose; the five
Karmendriyāṇi or organs of action, viz. larynx, hand,
foot, arms, and organ of generation; and an eleventh
organ called Manas, commonly translated ‘mind,’
which stands between both sets of Indriyas as an in-
ternal organ of perception and action, or of cogni-
tion and volition, [see {%manas%}]: the twenty-fifth
Tattva, Puruṣa or Soul, is to be wholly distinguished
from the twenty-four just enumerated; it is neither
a Producer nor Production; it is altogether passive,
and simply a looker-on, having nothing whatever to
do with the acts of creation, which it only contem-
plates, uniting itself with unintelligent Prakṛti, as
a lame man mounted on a blind man's shoulders,
for the sake of observing and enjoying the acts of
this Prakṛti, who herself cannot see or observe any-
thing; without that union no creation can take
place any more than can the birth of a child without
the union of male and female; this view of creation
implies the eternal existence of innumerable separate
individual souls, each soul by its junction with Pra-
kṛti causing the creation of its own phenomenal
world, which world, however, has an existence of
its own independent of all connection with the par-
ticular Puruṣa to which it is joined; moreover, each
soul is invested in the first place with a subtile body
[{%liṅga-śarīra%} or {%sūkṣma-śarīra%}] composed of
Buddhi, Ahaṅkāra, the five Tan-mātras, and the
eleven organs, and afterwards with a grosser body
formed of the five elements; the former accompany-
ing the soul through all its transmigrations, while the
latter perishes; this system also teaches that Prakṛti
and its products may be regarded as made up of
three ingredients in a state of equipoise, viz. Sattva,
Rajas, and Tamas, Goodness, Passion, and Darkness,
commonly called Guṇas, but rather substances than
qualities, and more correctly translated ‘fetters,’ be-
cause they are like a triple-stranded rope [see
{%guṇa%}] which binds and confines the soul: the Sāṅ-
khya system agrees with the Vedānta in being
synthetical, and so differing from the Analytical
Nyāya; its great point of divergence from the
Vedānta is in maintaining two principles which the
Vedānta denies, [see {%vedānta%}]; it is said to be
atheistical as ignoring all notice of a Supreme Soul,
[Page1103-c+ 80]
whose existence is, however, established by the Yoga
branch of the Sāṅkhya proper, [see {%yoga%}]: the
vague outlines of the system before its crystallization
into a distinct school of dualism are propounded in
the first Book of Manu: its more fully developed
doctrines are contained in the Sāṅkhya-sūtras ascribed
to Kapila, in the Tattva-samāsa, or Summary of
Principles, ascribed to the same author, in the
Sāṅkhya-kārikā [see below], and the numerous
commentaries on these works, some of which are
enumerated below: the Buddhist system and that
of bishop Berkeley in Europe have many points of
connection with the Sāṅkhya, but the modern phi-
losophers of India pay far more attention to the
Nyāya and Vedānta); a follower of the Sāṅkhya
system of philosophy; a patronymic of the Vedic
Ṛṣi Atri; epithet of Śiva. {%—Sāṅkhya-kārikā,%} f.,
