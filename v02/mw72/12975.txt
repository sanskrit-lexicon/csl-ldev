{#ओम्#}¦ {%om,%} ind. (said to be fr. rt. {%av;%} perhaps
<div n="lb"/>originally {%oṃ,%} which may be derived fr. {%āṃ,%} and this
<div n="lb"/>fr. {%ā%}), a word of solemn affirmation and respectful
<div n="lb"/>assent (sometimes translated by yes, verily, so be it,
<div n="lb"/>and in this sense compared with Amen). It is placed
<div n="lb"/>at the commencement of most Hindū works, and as
<div n="lb"/>a sacred exclamation may be uttered (but not so as
<div n="lb"/>to be heard by ears profane) at the beginning and
<div n="lb"/>end of a reading of the Vedas or previously to any
<div n="lb"/>prayer. It is also regarded as a particle of auspicious
<div n="lb"/>salutation (Hail!). {%Om%} appears first in the Upani-
<div n="lb"/>shads as a mystic monosyllable, and is there set forth
<div n="lb"/>as the object of profound religious meditation, the
<div n="lb"/>highest spiritual efficacy being attributed not only to
<div n="lb"/>the whole word but also to the three sounds {%a, u, m,%}
<div n="lb"/>of which it consists. In later times {%om%} is the mystic
<div n="lb"/>name for the Hindū triad, and represents the union of
<div n="lb"/>the three gods, viz. {%a%} (Viṣṇu), {%u%} (Śiva), {%m%} (Brahmā).
<div n="lb"/>It may also be typical of the three Vedas. {%Om%} is
<div n="lb"/>usually called {%praṇava,%} more rarely {%akṣaram%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%ekākṣaram,%} and only in later times {%oṃ-kāra.%}
<div n="lb"/>The Buddhists use {%om%} at the commencement of
<div n="lb"/>their {%vidyā ṣaḍ-akṣarī%} or mystical formulary in
<div n="lb"/>six syllables (viz. {%om māni padme hūṃ%}). Lexico-
<div n="lb"/>graphers affirm that besides the above uses, {%om%} may
<div n="lb"/>imply command or injunction, removal or warding
<div n="lb"/>off (Away! Hence!), and be used as an inceptive par-
<div n="lb"/>ticle. Grammarians assert that before {%om%} a preced-
<div n="lb"/>ing {%a%} or {%ā%} at the end of a word should be cut off
<div n="lb"/>(e. g. {%vijayoṅkāraḥ%} for {%vijayauṅkāraḥ (°ya-oṅ°),%}
<div n="lb"/>thanksgiving for victory; see Gram. 38. <nsi>b</nsi>). {%—Oṃ-kāra,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%as,%} m. the sacred and mystical syllable {%om;%} the ex-
<div n="lb"/>clamation {%om;%} pronouncing the syllable {%om; (ā),%} f.
<div n="lb"/>a Buddhist Śakti or female personification of divine
<div n="lb"/>energy. {%—Oṃkāra-grantha, as,%} m. title of a work
<div n="lb"/>of Nārāyaṇa. {%—Oṃkāra-tīrtha,%} N. of a Tīrtha.
<div n="lb"/>{%—Oṃkāra-bhaṭṭa, as,%} m., N. of a man.
