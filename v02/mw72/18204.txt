<div n="lb"/>This particle is placed after the word to which it
<div n="lb"/>gives force; and in Vedic Sanskrit is generally, but
<div n="lb"/>not always, found without any other negative particle,
<div n="lb"/>whereas in the later language another negative is
<div n="lb"/>usually added (e. g. {%āpaś cana pra minanti vrataṃ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vām,%} not even the waters violate your ordinance;
<div n="lb"/>{%nāha vivyāca pṛthivī canainam,%} the earth even

<div n="lb"/>{%katham, kadā, kutas, kva,%} it makes them in-
<div n="lb"/>definite; see 2. {%ka,%} &c.
