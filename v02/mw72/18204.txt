{#चन#}¦ {%cana%} (originally for {%ca+na%}), ind. and
not, also not, even not, not even; even, also, and.
This particle is placed after the word to which it
gives force; and in Vedic Sanskrit is generally, but
not always, found without any other negative particle,
whereas in the later language another negative is
usually added (e. g. {%āpaś cana pra minanti vrataṃ%}
{%vām,%} not even the waters violate your ordinance;
{%nāha vivyāca pṛthivī canainam,%} the earth even
does not contain him). When {%cana%} is added to the
interrogatives {%ka, katara, katama, kad, kim,%}
{%katham, kadā, kutas, kva,%} it makes them in-
definite; see 2. {%ka,%} &c.
