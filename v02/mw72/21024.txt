{#तु#} 3¦. {%tu,%} ind. (a particle, perhaps connected
<div n="lb"/>with the pronom. base 2. {%ta,%} or with the Vedic pro-
<div n="lb"/>noun {%tva;%} never found at the beginning of a sentence
<div n="lb"/>or verse, and causing the verb with which it is con-
<div n="lb"/>structed to retain its accent). As a particle implying
<div n="lb"/>‘earnest entreaty’ or ‘urgent request’ it is often used in
<div n="lb"/>the Veda, like Lat. <nsi>dum,</nsi> with an imperative, and may
<div n="lb"/>be translated by ‘pray!’ ‘I beg,’ ‘do’ (e. g. {%ā tveta,%}
<div n="lb"/>come here, do); or it may be rendered by ‘well,’
<div n="lb"/>‘now then,’ ‘now,’ ‘just.’ As an adversative particle
<div n="lb"/>it is equivalent to ‘but,’ ‘on the contrary,’ ‘on the
<div n="lb"/>other hand’ (e. g. {%na cchinati janayati tu,%} he
<div n="lb"/>does not destroy but he produces). The sense ‘but’
<div n="lb"/>is most common in later Sanskrit.
