{#विष्णु#}¦ {%viṣṇu, us, us, u%} (in Uṇādi-s. III.
<div n="lb"/>39. said to be fr. rt. 2. {%viṣ,%} ‘to pervade;’ according
<div n="lb"/>to some fr. rt. 1. {%viś%}), all-pervading, encompassing,
<div n="lb"/>pervading, penetrating (Ved); ({%us%}), m., N. of one
<div n="lb"/>of the principal Hindū deities, (in the later mythology
<div n="lb"/>regarded as ‘the preserver,’ and with Brahmā ‘the
<div n="lb"/>creator’ and Śiva ‘the destroyer,’ constituting the
<div n="lb"/>well-known Tri-mūrti or triad; although Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>comes second in the triad he is identified with the
<div n="lb"/>supreme deity by his worshippers; in the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>period, however, he is not placed in the foremost
<div n="lb"/>rank, and though frequently invoked with Indra,
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa, the Maruts, Rudra, Vāyu, and the Ādityas,
<div n="lb"/>his superiority to these is never stated, and he is even
<div n="lb"/>described in one place as celebrating the praises of
<div n="lb"/>Indra and deriving his power from that god [cf.
<div n="lb"/>his later name {%Indrānuja,%} ‘younger brother of
<div n="lb"/>Indra’], the point which distinguishes him from the
<div n="lb"/>other Vedic deities being chiefly his striding over the
<div n="lb"/>heavens, which he is said to do in three paces [see
<div n="lb"/>{%tri-vikrama%}], explained as denoting the threefold
<div n="lb"/>manifestations of light in the form of fire, lightning,
<div n="lb"/>and the sun, or as designating the three daily stations
<div n="lb"/>of the sun in his rising, culminating, and setting;
<div n="lb"/>the later legend of the Vāmana Ava-tāra grew out
<div n="lb"/>of this Vedic conception [see {%bali%}]; he does not
<div n="lb"/>appear to have been included at first among the
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas or sons of Aditi, whose number in the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>period varies from six to eight, though in later times,
<div n="lb"/>when their number was raised to twelve, represent-
<div n="lb"/>ing the sun in the twelve months of the year, Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>is accorded the foremost place among them; in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas he is identified with sacrifice, and in one
<div n="lb"/>described as a dwarf; in the Mahā-bhārata and Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa he is not connected with the sun, but gradually
<div n="lb"/>rises to the supremacy which he now enjoys as the most
<div n="lb"/>popular deity of modern Hindū worship, and although
<div n="lb"/>in some passages of the former he is represented as
<div n="lb"/>paying homage to Śiva [cf. his name {%Śiva-kīrtana%}],
<div n="lb"/>the great rivalry between these gods and their wor-
<div n="lb"/>shippers — who are respectively called Vaiṣṇavas and
<div n="lb"/>Śaivas, and who each exalt their favourite to the first
<div n="lb"/>place in the Hindū Pantheon — is not fully developed
<div n="lb"/>till the period of the Purāṇas: the distinguishing
<div n="lb"/>feature in the character of the Post-vedic Viṣṇu is
<div n="lb"/>his condescending to become incarnate in a portion
<div n="lb"/>of his essence on ten principal occasions, to set right
<div n="lb"/>particular disturbances or deliver mankind from certain
<div n="lb"/>great dangers; his ten principal incarnations or Ava-
<div n="lb"/>tāras are, 1. the Matsya or ‘fish;’ 2. the Kūrma or
<div n="lb"/>‘tortoise;’ 3. the Varāha or ‘boar;’ 4. the Nara-
[Page0949-b+ 81]
<div n="lb"/>siṃha or ‘man-lion;’ 5. the Vāmana or ‘dwarf’ [see
<div n="lb"/>{%bali%}]; 6. Paraśu-rāma or ‘Rāma with the axe,’
<div n="lb"/>i. e. Rāma, son of Jamad-agni; 7. Rāma-candra or
<div n="lb"/>‘the illustrious Rāma,’ i. e. Rāma, the son of Daśa-
<div n="lb"/>ratha and hero of the Rāmāyaṇa; 8. Kṛṣṇa or
<div n="lb"/>‘the dark One,’ who is held by the Vaiṣṇavas to be
<div n="lb"/>not so much an incarnation of Viṣṇu as the very
<div n="lb"/>essence of Viṣṇu or rather Viṣṇu himself, so that
<div n="lb"/>the Bala-rāma incarnation, which is sometimes mixed
<div n="lb"/>up with this eighth Ava-tāra, is also occasionally
<div n="lb"/>substituted for it; 9. Buddha or ‘the enlightened
<div n="lb"/>One,’ by adopting whom the Brāhmans appear to
<div n="lb"/>have desired to effect a compromise between their
<div n="lb"/>own creed and Buddhism; 10. Kalki, which is
<div n="lb"/>yet to come; see these various incarnations s. v.;
<div n="lb"/>some of the Purāṇas multiply these Ava-tāras to the
<div n="lb"/>number of twenty-two or even twenty-four; as the
<div n="lb"/>supreme being Viṣṇu is often identified with Nārā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa, the personified Puruṣa or primeval living spirit
<div n="lb"/>[described as moving on the waters, reclining on
<div n="lb"/>Śeṣa, the serpent of infinity, while the god Brahmā
<div n="lb"/>emerges from a lotus growing from his navel; cf.
<div n="lb"/>Manu I. 10]; the wife of Viṣṇu is Lakṣmī or
<div n="lb"/>Śrī, and his paradise is called Vaikuṇṭha; he is
<div n="lb"/>usually represented with a peculiar mark on his breast
<div n="lb"/>called Śrī-vatsa, and as holding a {%śaṅkha%} or conch-
<div n="lb"/>shell called Pāñcajanya, a {%cakra%} or quoit-like missile-
<div n="lb"/>weapon called Su-darśana, a {%gadā%} or club called Kau-
<div n="lb"/>modakī, and a {%padma%} or lotus; he has also a bow
<div n="lb"/>called Śārṅga, and a sword called Nandaka; his {%vāhana%}
<div n="lb"/>or vehicle is Garuḍa, q. v.; he has a jewel on his
<div n="lb"/>wrist called Syamantaka, another on his breast called
<div n="lb"/>Kaustubha, and the river Ganges is said to issue from
<div n="lb"/>his foot; the demons slain by him in his character of
<div n="lb"/>‘preserver from evil,’ or by Kṛṣṇa as identified
<div n="lb"/>with him, are Madhu, Dhenuka, Cāṇūra, Yamala,
<div n="lb"/>and Arjuna [see {%yamalārjuna%}], Kālanemi, Haya-
<div n="lb"/>grīva, Śakaṭa, Ariṣṭa, Kaiṭabha, Kaṃsa, Keśin,
<div n="lb"/>Mura, Sālva, Mainda, Dvi-vida, Rāhu, Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu, Vāṇa, Kāliya, Naraka, Bali; he is wor-
<div n="lb"/>shipped under a thousand names, which are all
<div n="lb"/>enumerated in the Anuśāsana-parvan of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata, II. 6950-7056; for his epithet, ‘younger
<div n="lb"/>brother of Indra,’ see {%bali;%} he is sometimes regarded
