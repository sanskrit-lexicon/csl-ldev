{#विष्णु#}¦ {%viṣṇu, us, us, u%} (in Uṇādi-s. III.
39. said to be fr. rt. 2. {%viṣ,%} ‘to pervade;’ according
to some fr. rt. 1. {%viś%}), all-pervading, encompassing,
pervading, penetrating (Ved); ({%us%}), m., N. of one
of the principal Hindū deities, (in the later mythology
regarded as ‘the preserver,’ and with Brahmā ‘the
creator’ and Śiva ‘the destroyer,’ constituting the
well-known Tri-mūrti or triad; although Viṣṇu
comes second in the triad he is identified with the
supreme deity by his worshippers; in the Vedic
period, however, he is not placed in the foremost
rank, and though frequently invoked with Indra,
Varuṇa, the Maruts, Rudra, Vāyu, and the Ādityas,
his superiority to these is never stated, and he is even
described in one place as celebrating the praises of
Indra and deriving his power from that god [cf.
his later name {%Indrānuja,%} ‘younger brother of
Indra’], the point which distinguishes him from the
other Vedic deities being chiefly his striding over the
heavens, which he is said to do in three paces [see
{%tri-vikrama%}], explained as denoting the threefold
manifestations of light in the form of fire, lightning,
and the sun, or as designating the three daily stations
of the sun in his rising, culminating, and setting;
the later legend of the Vāmana Ava-tāra grew out
of this Vedic conception [see {%bali%}]; he does not
appear to have been included at first among the
Ādityas or sons of Aditi, whose number in the Vedic
period varies from six to eight, though in later times,
when their number was raised to twelve, represent-
ing the sun in the twelve months of the year, Viṣṇu
is accorded the foremost place among them; in the
Brāhmaṇas he is identified with sacrifice, and in one
described as a dwarf; in the Mahā-bhārata and Rāmā-
yaṇa he is not connected with the sun, but gradually
rises to the supremacy which he now enjoys as the most
popular deity of modern Hindū worship, and although
in some passages of the former he is represented as
paying homage to Śiva [cf. his name {%Śiva-kīrtana%}],
the great rivalry between these gods and their wor-
shippers — who are respectively called Vaiṣṇavas and
Śaivas, and who each exalt their favourite to the first
place in the Hindū Pantheon — is not fully developed
till the period of the Purāṇas: the distinguishing
feature in the character of the Post-vedic Viṣṇu is
his condescending to become incarnate in a portion
of his essence on ten principal occasions, to set right
particular disturbances or deliver mankind from certain
great dangers; his ten principal incarnations or Ava-
tāras are, 1. the Matsya or ‘fish;’ 2. the Kūrma or
‘tortoise;’ 3. the Varāha or ‘boar;’ 4. the Nara-
[Page0949-b+ 81]
siṃha or ‘man-lion;’ 5. the Vāmana or ‘dwarf’ [see
{%bali%}]; 6. Paraśu-rāma or ‘Rāma with the axe,’
i. e. Rāma, son of Jamad-agni; 7. Rāma-candra or
‘the illustrious Rāma,’ i. e. Rāma, the son of Daśa-
ratha and hero of the Rāmāyaṇa; 8. Kṛṣṇa or
‘the dark One,’ who is held by the Vaiṣṇavas to be
not so much an incarnation of Viṣṇu as the very
essence of Viṣṇu or rather Viṣṇu himself, so that
the Bala-rāma incarnation, which is sometimes mixed
up with this eighth Ava-tāra, is also occasionally
substituted for it; 9. Buddha or ‘the enlightened
One,’ by adopting whom the Brāhmans appear to
have desired to effect a compromise between their
own creed and Buddhism; 10. Kalki, which is
yet to come; see these various incarnations s. v.;
some of the Purāṇas multiply these Ava-tāras to the
number of twenty-two or even twenty-four; as the
supreme being Viṣṇu is often identified with Nārā-
yaṇa, the personified Puruṣa or primeval living spirit
[described as moving on the waters, reclining on
Śeṣa, the serpent of infinity, while the god Brahmā
emerges from a lotus growing from his navel; cf.
Manu I. 10]; the wife of Viṣṇu is Lakṣmī or
Śrī, and his paradise is called Vaikuṇṭha; he is
usually represented with a peculiar mark on his breast
called Śrī-vatsa, and as holding a {%śaṅkha%} or conch-
shell called Pāñcajanya, a {%cakra%} or quoit-like missile-
weapon called Su-darśana, a {%gadā%} or club called Kau-
modakī, and a {%padma%} or lotus; he has also a bow
called Śārṅga, and a sword called Nandaka; his {%vāhana%}
or vehicle is Garuḍa, q. v.; he has a jewel on his
wrist called Syamantaka, another on his breast called
Kaustubha, and the river Ganges is said to issue from
his foot; the demons slain by him in his character of
‘preserver from evil,’ or by Kṛṣṇa as identified
with him, are Madhu, Dhenuka, Cāṇūra, Yamala,
and Arjuna [see {%yamalārjuna%}], Kālanemi, Haya-
grīva, Śakaṭa, Ariṣṭa, Kaiṭabha, Kaṃsa, Keśin,
Mura, Sālva, Mainda, Dvi-vida, Rāhu, Hiraṇya-
kaśipu, Vāṇa, Kāliya, Naraka, Bali; he is wor-
shipped under a thousand names, which are all
enumerated in the Anuśāsana-parvan of the Mahā-
bhārata, II. 6950-7056; for his epithet, ‘younger
brother of Indra,’ see {%bali;%} he is sometimes regarded
