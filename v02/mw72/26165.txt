to verbs and their derivative nouns, expressing) out,
forth, outward, out of, out from, away, away from;
({%nis%} is used as an independent and separable adverb in
Atharva-veda VI. 18, 3; VII. 115, 3; XVI. 2, 1.)
{%Nis%} is also prefixed to nouns, not immediately con-
nected with verbs, in the sense ‘out of,’ ‘away
from’ [cf. {%nir-vana%}], but more commonly in the
sense of a privative or negative adverb = 3. {%a,%} ‘no,’
‘not,’ ‘without.’ In this latter signification it may
form either negative substantives (e. g. fr. {%artha,%} ad-
vantage, {%nir-artha,%} disadvantage) or more frequently

less). {%Nis%} is liable to be euphonically changed to
{%nir, niḥ, niś, niṣ%} or {%nī%} [cf. {%nī-rasa,%} &c.] accord-
ing to the letter which follows it.
