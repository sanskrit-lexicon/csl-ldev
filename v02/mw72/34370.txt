{#बत#} 1¦. {%bata,%} ind. (in the later language
{%vata%}), Ved. an interjection of astonishment, sorrow,
or regret, generally translatable by ah! oh! O! alas!
alack! wo! woe! (the word {%bata%} seems originally
to have stood immediately after the idea beginning
the sentence and giving rise to the interjection, e. g.
{%bato batāsi yama,%} alas! thou art a weak person, O
Yama.) According to native lexicographers the
senses in which {%bata%} may be used are expressed by
the following Sanskrit words, {%kheda, anu-kampa,%}
{%anu-krośa, vi-smaya, āścarya, san-toṣa, dhṛti,%}
{%ā-mantraṇa, nindā, sam-bodhana.%}
