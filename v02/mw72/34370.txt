{#बत#} 1¦. {%bata,%} ind. (in the later language
<div n="lb"/>{%vata%}), Ved. an interjection of astonishment, sorrow,
<div n="lb"/>or regret, generally translatable by ah! oh! O! alas!
<div n="lb"/>alack! wo! woe! (the word {%bata%} seems originally
<div n="lb"/>to have stood immediately after the idea beginning
<div n="lb"/>the sentence and giving rise to the interjection, e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%bato batāsi yama,%} alas! thou art a weak person, O
<div n="lb"/>Yama.) According to native lexicographers the
<div n="lb"/>senses in which {%bata%} may be used are expressed by
<div n="lb"/>the following Sanskrit words, {%kheda, anu-kampa,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%anu-krośa, vi-smaya, āścarya, san-toṣa, dhṛti,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ā-mantraṇa, nindā, sam-bodhana.%}
