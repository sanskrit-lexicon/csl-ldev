sovereign of Ayodhyā (son of Bāhu; he is said to
have been called Sagara, as born together with a
poison given to his mother by the other wife of his
father; he was father of Asamañja by Keśinī and
of sixty thousand sons by Sumati; the latter were
turned into a heap of ashes by the sage Kapila, see
{%bhagīratha,%} and their funeral ceremonies could
only be performed by the waters of Gaṅgā to be
brought from heaven for the purpose of purifying
their remains; this was finally accomplished by the
devotion of Bhagīratha, q. v., who having led the
river to the sea, called it Sāgara in honour of his
ancestor: Sagara is described as having subdued the
Śakas, Yavanas, and other barbarous tribes, and de-
prived them of their social and religious position);
