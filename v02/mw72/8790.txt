<div n="lb"/>1. Su-samiddha (or the fuel); 2. and 3. Tanūnapāt
<div n="lb"/>and Narāśaṃsa (these are sometimes invoked in one
<div n="lb"/>verse as mystic names of fire); 4. The divine being
<div n="lb"/>who bears the invocations to the gods (see under {%iḍ%});
<div n="lb"/>5. Barhis (or the sacred grass); 6. The doors of the
<div n="lb"/>chambers in which the sacrifice is offered; 7. Night

<div n="lb"/>called Pracetasas, who preside over and protect the
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial rite; 9. The three goddesses, Ilā (see under
<div n="lb"/>{%iḍā%}), Sarasvatī (goddess of eloquence), and Mahī (a
<div n="lb"/>form of Bhāratī or speech); 10. Tvaṣṭṛ (the maker
<div n="lb"/>or creator); 11. Vanas-pati (the tree or wooden column
<div n="lb"/>to which the victim is tied); 12. Svāhā (the exclama-
<div n="lb"/>tion used in inviting the gods to the sacrifice when
<div n="lb"/>finally offered in the fire). All these are by Sāy. re-
<div n="lb"/>garded as forms of Agni. See Ṛg-veda I. 13.
