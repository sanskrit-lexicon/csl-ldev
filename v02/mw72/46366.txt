{#शाक्त#}¦ {%śākta, as, ī, am%} (fr. {%śakti%}), relating
to power or energy, relating to Śakti or the divine
energy under its female personification; ({%as%}), m. a
worshipper of the divine power under its female
representation, (this power or energy which was at
first regarded as the mere will of the Supreme Being
willing to create the universe was afterwards thought
of as a separate deity, and identified with the wives
of the Triad, Sarasvatī being the Śakti or Energy of
Brahman, Lakṣmī of Viṣṇu, and Durgā of Śiva,
but the latter being the Destroyer, his Energy became
the personification of everything terrible, and his
wife Durgā, representing this terrific power, became
a favourite object of propitiation and worship; hence
the Śāktas are generally worshippers of Durgā, and
form one of the three principal sects of the Hindūs;
the tenets of this sect are contained in the Tantras
[see {%tantra%}], and the ritual enjoined is of two
kinds, the impurer being called {%vāmācāra,%} q. v.,
the purer {%dakṣiṇācāra,%} q. v., which has led to a
division of the sect into Vāmācārins and Dakṣiṇā-
cārins); a teacher, preceptor (Ved., Sāy. {%= śakti-%}
{%mat, śikṣaka%}). {%—Śākta-tantra, am,%} n., N. of

work by Abhinava-gupta. {%—Śāktānanda-taraṅgiṇī%}
