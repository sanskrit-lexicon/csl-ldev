{#एवम्#}¦ {%evam,%} ind. (cf. 1. {%eva%} and {%etad%}), so,
<div n="lb"/>thus, in this way, in such a manner, such. {%Evam%} is
<div n="lb"/>not found in the oldest hymns of the Veda, where its
<div n="lb"/>place is taken by {%eva,%} but occurs in later hymns and
<div n="lb"/>in the Brāhmaṇas, especially in connection with the
<div n="lb"/>rt. {%vid,%} ‘to know,’ and its derivatives (e. g. {%ya evaṃ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%veda,%} he who knows so; cf. {%evaṃ-vid%} below). In
<div n="lb"/>classical Sanskrit {%evam%} occurs very frequently, espe-
<div n="lb"/>cially in connection with the roots {%vac,%} ‘to speak,’
<div n="lb"/>and {%śru,%} ‘to hear,’ and refers to what precedes as
<div n="lb"/>well as to what follows (e. g. {%evam uktvā,%} having so
<div n="lb"/>said; {%evamevaitat,%} this is so; {%evam astu%} or {%evam%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhavatu,%} be it so, I assent; {%asty evam,%} it is so;
<div n="lb"/>{%yady evam,%} if this be so; {%kim evam,%} how so?
<div n="lb"/>what is the meaning of it? what does this refer to?
<div n="lb"/>{%maivam,%} not so! {%evam — yathā%} or {%yathā — evam,%}
<div n="lb"/>so — as). {%Evam%} is often used like an adjective (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%evaṃ te vacane rataḥ,%} rejoicing in such words of
<div n="lb"/>thine; where {%evam = evaṃ-vidhe%}). Sometimes
<div n="lb"/>{%evam%} is merely an expletive. According to lexico-
<div n="lb"/>graphers {%evam%} may imply likeness (so); sameness
<div n="lb"/>of manner (thus); assent (yes, verily); affirmation
<div n="lb"/>(certainly, indeed, assuredly); command (thus, &c.);
<div n="lb"/>and be used as an expletive. {%—Evaṃ-rūpa, as, ā, am,%}
