{#सम्#} 2¦. {%sam%} [cf. 5. {%sa, sama;%} by some con-
nected with 4. {%sa%}], ind. (as a preposition or prefix
to verbs and verbal derivatives opposed to 1. {%vi,%}
q. v., and like Gr. <lang n="greek">σύν,</lang> Lat. <nsi>con,</nsi> expressing) with,
together with, along with, together (e. g. {%saṃ-yuj,%}
to join together; {%sañ-ci,%} to gather together; {%san-%}
{%dhā,%} to place together; {%san-dhi,%} placing together);
when prefixed to some roots and verbal derivatives
{%sam%} intensifies the idea contained in the simple rt.,
and may often be translated by ‘much,’ ‘greatly,’
‘thoroughly,’ ‘quite,’ ‘very,’ ‘well,’ (see {%san-tap,%}
{%san-tuṣ,%} &c.); it may also express ‘completeness,’
‘perfection,’ ‘beauty,’ &c., (see {%sam-uccheda, san-%}
{%tamas,%} &c.); it is not unfrequently prefixed to
nouns in the sense of {%sama,%} ‘same,’ ‘like,’ ‘similar,’
(see {%sama,%} cf. {%sam-artha%}); in the Veda it may be
used as a separable preposition with inst. (e. g. {%asṛ-%}
{%jad madhunā sam madhūni,%} Ṛg-veda X. 54, 6);
[cf. according to some, Gr. <lang n="greek">σύν, ξύν;</lang> perhaps Lat.
