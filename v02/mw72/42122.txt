{#वि#} 1¦. {%vi,%} ind. (thought by some to be for
an original {%dvi,%} meaning ‘in two parts;’ as a prepo-
sition or prefix to verbs it is opposed to {%sam,%} q. v.,
and expresses) apart, apart from, asunder, in different
directions, to and fro, about, away, away from, off,
&c. (e. g. {%vi-yuj,%} to disjoin, separate; {%vi-dṝ,%} to
tear asunder; {%vi-kṝ,%} to scatter in different direc-
tions; {%vi-cal,%} to move to and fro; {%vi-cchid,%} to cut
away, cut off); when prefixed to some roots, {%vi%} gives
a meaning opposite to the idea contained in the
simple rt. (e. g. {%krī,%} to buy; {%vi-krī,%} to sell; {%smṛ,%}
to remember; {%vi-smṛ,%} to forget); in other cases
it appears either not to affect or simply to intensify
that idea [cf. {%naś, vi-naś, hiṃs, vi-hiṃs%}]. {%Vi%} may
also be used with verbs or nouns, and other parts of
speech derived from verbs, to express ‘division’ [cf.
{%vi-bhid, vi-bheda, vi-bhaj, vi-bhāga%}]; ‘distinction’
[cf. {%vi-śiṣ, vi-śeṣa, vi-vic, vi-veka%}]; ‘discrimi-
nation’ [cf. {%vy-avacchid, vy-avaccheda%}]; ‘distri-
bution,’ ‘arrangement,’ ‘order’ [cf. {%vi-dhā, vi-%}
{%dhāna%}]; ‘opposition’ [cf. {%vi-rudh, vi-rodha%}];
‘discussion,’ ‘deliberation’ [cf. {%vi-car, vi-cāra%}];
‘privation’ [cf. {%vi-nī, vi-nayana%}]. {%Vi%} may
also be used with nouns, adjective or substantive,
not immediately connected with verbs, to express
‘difference’ [cf. {%vi-lakṣaṇa%}]; ‘variety’ [cf. {%vi-%}
{%citra%}]; ‘distinction’ [cf. {%vi-śeṣa%}]; ‘intensity,’
‘greatness,’ ‘largeness’ [cf. {%vi-karāla%}]; ‘change’
[cf. {%vi-kāra%}]; ‘manifoldness’ [cf. {%vi-vidha%}]; ‘con-
trariety’ [cf. {%vi-loma%}]; ‘impropriety,’ ‘deviation
from right’ [cf. {%vi-janman, vi-karmika%}]; ‘nega-
tion’ or ‘privation’ (e. g. {%vi-jana,%} devoid of men;
in this sense {%vi%} is used like {%nis,%} q. v., and like 3. {%a,%}
q. v.); in this latter signification the use of {%vi%} often
corresponds to that of the Latin <nsi>dis, se,</nsi> and the English
prefixes <nsi>a, ex, de, dis, in, un,</nsi> &c.; [cf. Old Germ.
<nsi>wi-dar,</nsi> ‘against;’ Pers. <lang n="arabic">بى</lang> <nsi>bī,</nsi> ‘without;’ perhaps
Lat. <nsi>vê,</nsi> in words like <nsi>ve-cors, ve-sanus, vi</nsi> in <nsi>di-</nsi>
<nsi>vi-dere;</nsi> Lith. <nsi>be,</nsi> ‘without;’ Slav. <lang n="slavic">beζ</lang> (perhaps =
{%vahis%}).]
