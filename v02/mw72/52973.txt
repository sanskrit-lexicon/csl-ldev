{%Skambha, as,%}¦ m. support, prop, fulcrum; ‘the sup-
porter, propper,’ N. of a Vedic deity, (he is identified
in Atharva-veda X. 7. with the supreme Being him-
self, and is there represented, like Puruṣa, as co-
extensive with the universe, and comprehending
every existing thing in his members; the gods and
all other entities, and even such abstract conceptions
as faith, truth, &c., standing to him in the relation
of branches to a tree; in X. 8. he is described as a
sort of universal fulcrum as well as a universally dif-
fused essence, the sky and the earth being said to
be supported by him, and ‘all which has soul, which
breathes, which winks’ being identified with him;
he is even called {%jyeṣṭham brahma,%} which some
think may mean not only the highest divine essence,
but a kind of preæval Veda, of which the existing
Vedas are merely branches.) {%—Skambha-deṣṇa, as,%}
{%ā, am,%} Ved. whose gifts are firm, stable in giving
(said of the Maruts).
