{%Vājasaneyin, ī,%}¦ m. a member of the sect of the Vā-
<div n="lb"/>jasaneyins, a follower of the White Yajur-veda; a N. of
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya. {%—Vājasaneyi-śākhā,%} f. the branch or
<div n="lb"/>sect of the Vājasaneyins. {%—Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā,%} f.
<div n="lb"/>‘the collection of the Vājasaneyins,’ (i. e. the collection
<div n="lb"/>of hymns of the White Yajur-veda ascribed to the Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>Yājñavalkya and called ‘white’ or {%śukla%} to distinguish
<div n="lb"/>it from the Black or Dark Yajur-veda, which was
<div n="lb"/>the name given to the oldest collection or Taittirīya-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā [q. v.] of the Yajur-veda, because in this
<div n="lb"/>last, the separation between the Saṃhitā or collection
[Page0901-c+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>of Mantras and the Brāhmaṇa portion is greatly
<div n="lb"/>obscured, and the two are blended together; whereas
<div n="lb"/>the White Saṃhitā is clearly distinguished from the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa; it is divided into 40 Adhyāyas with
<div n="lb"/>303 Anuvākas, comprising 1975 sections or Kaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍikās; the legend relates that the Yajus in its ori-
<div n="lb"/>ginal form was taught by the Ṛṣi Vaiśampāyana
<div n="lb"/>to his pupil Yājñavalkya, but that the latter having
<div n="lb"/>incurred his teacher's anger was made to disgorge all
<div n="lb"/>the texts he had learnt, which were then picked up
<div n="lb"/>by Vaiśampāyana's other disciples in the form of
<div n="lb"/>partridges [see {%taittirīya-saṃhitā%}]; Yājñavalkya
<div n="lb"/>then hymned the Sun, who gratified by his homage,
<div n="lb"/>appeared in the form of a {%vājin%} or horse, and consented
<div n="lb"/>to give him fresh Yajus texts, which were not known
<div n="lb"/>to his former master; those who studied these texts
<div n="lb"/>were called Vājins from the shape assumed by the
<div n="lb"/>Sun.)
