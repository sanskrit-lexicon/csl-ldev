{%Vājasaneyin, ī,%}¦ m. a member of the sect of the Vā-
jasaneyins, a follower of the White Yajur-veda; a N. of
Yājñavalkya. {%—Vājasaneyi-śākhā,%} f. the branch or
sect of the Vājasaneyins. {%—Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā,%} f.
‘the collection of the Vājasaneyins,’ (i. e. the collection
of hymns of the White Yajur-veda ascribed to the Ṛṣi
Yājñavalkya and called ‘white’ or {%śukla%} to distinguish
it from the Black or Dark Yajur-veda, which was
the name given to the oldest collection or Taittirīya-
saṃhitā [q. v.] of the Yajur-veda, because in this
last, the separation between the Saṃhitā or collection
[Page0901-c+ 80]
of Mantras and the Brāhmaṇa portion is greatly
obscured, and the two are blended together; whereas
the White Saṃhitā is clearly distinguished from the
Brāhmaṇa; it is divided into 40 Adhyāyas with
303 Anuvākas, comprising 1975 sections or Kaṇ-
ḍikās; the legend relates that the Yajus in its ori-
ginal form was taught by the Ṛṣi Vaiśampāyana
to his pupil Yājñavalkya, but that the latter having
incurred his teacher's anger was made to disgorge all
the texts he had learnt, which were then picked up
by Vaiśampāyana's other disciples in the form of
partridges [see {%taittirīya-saṃhitā%}]; Yājñavalkya
then hymned the Sun, who gratified by his homage,
appeared in the form of a {%vājin%} or horse, and consented
to give him fresh Yajus texts, which were not known
to his former master; those who studied these texts
were called Vājins from the shape assumed by the
Sun.)
