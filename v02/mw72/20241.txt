{#णद्#}¦ {%ṇad, ṇam, ṇaś,%} &c. Many roots which
really begin with the dental {%n%} are written in
native grammars and the Dhātu-pāṭha with the cerebral
{%ṇ%} to show that the nasal is liable to be cerebralized
when preceded by prepositions like {%pra, pari,%} &c.
These roots will be found in the present Dictionary
under the dental {%n.%} See {%nad, nam, naś,%} &c.
