to become bad or corrupted, to be ruined, to perish,
suffer damage, to be soiled; to be or become
depraved or defiled or impure, to be violated (as a
woman), to be contaminated by a crime, to sin, to
commit a mistake, to be wrong; to be faithless or

that {%dūṣyate,%} Pass. of the Caus., may often more cor-
rectly be read where {%duṣyate%} is given in the printed
editions of epic poems, the sense of {%dūṣyate%} being
the same; according to Pāṇ. VI. 4, 91, another form
of the Caus., viz. {%doṣayati,%} &c., is optionally used in
speaking of moral corruption, e. g. {%kāmo dūṣayati%}
or {%doṣayati cittam,%} lust corrupts the mind.)
