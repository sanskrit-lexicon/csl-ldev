{%Tu%}¦ is sometimes, however, used for {%ca,%} ‘and’
(e. g. {%ā samudrāt pūrvād ā samudrāt tu paści-%}
{%māt,%} to the eastern sea and to the western sea); and
even for {%vā,%} ‘or’ (e. g. {%uṣṭra-yānaṃ samāruhya%}
{%khara-yānaṃ tu,%} having ascended a camel-carriage
or one drawn by donkeys). Sometimes it appears to
be incorrectly written for {%nu%} (e. g. {%kin tu%} for {%kin%}
{%nu%}). Occasionally it seems to be used for {%tadā%} after
{%cet%} (e. g. {%tāṃ ced na ditseyam pramathyaināṃ%}
{%hareyus tu,%} if I were not willing to give her then
they would take her by force). Not unfrequently {%tu%}
is used as an expletive to fill out a verse or prevent
the blending of vowels (e. g. {%īrṣyī ghṛṇī tv%}
{%a-santuṣṭaḥ,%} &c., an envious man, one over-com-
passionate, a discontented man, &c.). {%Tu — tu,%}
although — yet; {%api-tu,%} moreover; {%kin tu,%} but,
nevertheless, notwithstanding; {%paran tu,%} more-
over, but, nevertheless; {%na tv eva tu,%} but by no
means. According to lexicographers {%tu%} implies dis-
junction, mutual opposition, alternative, asseveration,
emphasis, conjunction, &c.
