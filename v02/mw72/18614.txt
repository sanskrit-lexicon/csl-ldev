{#चिद्#}¦ {%cid,%} ind. [cf. 2. {%ca%} and {%id%}], an enclitic
particle, requiring in the Veda a preceding simple
verb to retain its accent. In the Pada-pāṭha {%cid%} is
[Page0325-c+ 79]
considered as an independent word ({%kaś cid%} &c.
being always separated into two words). In later
Sanskrit it is generally a particle affixed to interroga-
tive pronouns to render them indefinite. The use
of {%cid%} in Vedic Sanskrit is principally to lay stress or
emphasis on a preceding word or to extend or limit
the sense. Hence it is often translateable by ‘even,’
‘indeed,’ ‘also,’ ‘at least,’ ‘just,’ ‘merely,’ &c. (e. g.
{%devāś cid,%} the gods indeed; {%ekasya cid,%} of one
merely); or when preceded by a negative particle by
‘not even’ (e. g. {%na devāś cid,%} not even the gods):
but its force may often be expressed by merely laying
an emphasis on the word by which it is preceded.
Hence in Nirukta I. 4. it is said to be used {%pūjāyām,%}
i. e. for enhancing the force of a word. It is also
stated by Yāska to be a particle of comparison
({%upamārthe%}). The following Vedic uses of {%cid%}
may be noted; {%yac cid, yathā cid,%} = when indeed,
as indeed; {%cid — cid%} or {%cid — ca%} or {%cid — u,%} = as well
as — as; both — and.
