{#चिद्#}¦ {%cid,%} ind. [cf. 2. {%ca%} and {%id%}], an enclitic
<div n="lb"/>particle, requiring in the Veda a preceding simple
<div n="lb"/>verb to retain its accent. In the Pada-pāṭha {%cid%} is
[Page0325-c+ 79]
<div n="lb"/>considered as an independent word ({%kaś cid%} &c.
<div n="lb"/>being always separated into two words). In later
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit it is generally a particle affixed to interroga-
<div n="lb"/>tive pronouns to render them indefinite. The use
<div n="lb"/>of {%cid%} in Vedic Sanskrit is principally to lay stress or
<div n="lb"/>emphasis on a preceding word or to extend or limit
<div n="lb"/>the sense. Hence it is often translateable by ‘even,’
<div n="lb"/>‘indeed,’ ‘also,’ ‘at least,’ ‘just,’ ‘merely,’ &c. (e. g.
<div n="lb"/>{%devāś cid,%} the gods indeed; {%ekasya cid,%} of one
<div n="lb"/>merely); or when preceded by a negative particle by
<div n="lb"/>‘not even’ (e. g. {%na devāś cid,%} not even the gods):
<div n="lb"/>but its force may often be expressed by merely laying
<div n="lb"/>an emphasis on the word by which it is preceded.
<div n="lb"/>Hence in Nirukta I. 4. it is said to be used {%pūjāyām,%}
<div n="lb"/>i. e. for enhancing the force of a word. It is also
<div n="lb"/>stated by Yāska to be a particle of comparison
<div n="lb"/>({%upamārthe%}). The following Vedic uses of {%cid%}
<div n="lb"/>may be noted; {%yac cid, yathā cid,%} = when indeed,
<div n="lb"/>as indeed; {%cid — cid%} or {%cid — ca%} or {%cid — u,%} = as well
<div n="lb"/>as — as; both — and.
