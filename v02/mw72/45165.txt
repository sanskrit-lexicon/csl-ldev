<div n="lb"/>a follower of the Vaiśeṣika doctrine; ({%am%}), n.,
<div n="lb"/>N. of one of the two great divisions of the
<div n="lb"/>Nyāya school of philosophy founded by Kaṇāda,
<div n="lb"/>(it was probably a later development of the other
<div n="lb"/>great division or ‘Nyāya proper’ founded by Gau-
<div n="lb"/>tama, with which it agrees in its analytical method
<div n="lb"/>of treating the various subjects of inquiry, but from
<div n="lb"/>which it differs in propounding only seven categories
<div n="lb"/>or topics instead of sixteen; and more especially in
<div n="lb"/>its doctrine of {%viśeṣa,%} ‘particularity or individual
<div n="lb"/>essence,’ i. e. in its maintaining the eternally distinct
<div n="lb"/>or <nsi>sui generis</nsi> nature of the nine substances, air, fire,
<div n="lb"/>water, earth, mind, ether, time, space, and soul, of
<div n="lb"/>which the first five, including mind, are held to be
<div n="lb"/>atomic: the seven Padārthas or categories are,
<div n="lb"/>1. Dravya, ‘substance,’ divided into nine, as above
<div n="lb"/>stated; 2. Guṇa, ‘quality,’ of which there are twenty-
<div n="lb"/>four [see {%guṇa%}]; 3. Karman, ‘action;’ 4. Sāmānya,
<div n="lb"/>‘genus’ and ‘species;’ 5. Viśeṣa, ‘particularity,’
<div n="lb"/>described above; 6. Samavāya, ‘co-inherence’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘perpetual intimate connection;’ 7. A-bhāva, ‘non-
<div n="lb"/>existence’ or ‘privation:’ Kaṇāda's system allows
<div n="lb"/>only two of the Pramāṇas, i. e. instruments or means
<div n="lb"/>of obtaining true knowledge, of the four admitted by
<div n="lb"/>the Nyāya proper, viz. {%pratyakṣa%} or knowledge

<div n="lb"/>arising from contact of a sense with its object, and
<div n="lb"/>{%anumāna,%} inference of three kinds [a priori, a pos-
<div n="lb"/>teriori, and analogy], but the other Pramāṇas are
<div n="lb"/>said by some to be contained in these two; the
<div n="lb"/>system is taught in the form of Sūtras, and the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśeṣika-sūtras, like those of the Nyāya proper,
<div n="lb"/>have been commented on by a triple set of com-
<div n="lb"/>mentaries, and expounded in various works, of which
<div n="lb"/>the best known are the Bhāṣā-pariccheda with its
<div n="lb"/>commentary, called Siddhānta-muktāvalī, and the
