8. {%Vasumitra%}¦ (No. 36, L. 4):
The first part of the name is {%vasu%} (wealth) and the second is
{%mitra%} the whole literally meaning ‘a friend of wealth’. Another
possibility is that the name vasu stands for a group of deities
and mitra means the sun and vasumitra thereby yielding the
sense “a sun among deities”
