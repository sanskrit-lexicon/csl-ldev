8. {%Sikatā<sup>44</sup>%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
The river Sikatā takes its source from the mountain Raivataka.
It is the same as Suvarṇa-sikatā mentioned in the Junāgaṛh
Rock Inscription of Rudradāman.<sup>45</sup> This Sikatā or Suvarṇasi-
katā is to be identified with modern Soṇarekhā.<sup>46</sup> The name
[Page-296+ 39]
Suvaṇṇarehā (Suvarṇarekhā) is also met with in Vividhatīr-
thakalpa.<sup>47</sup> Thus the first part of the river's name has remained
unchanged for about two thousand years. The second part has
been replaced by a new one. The exact derivative as suggested
by Chatterji will be a form like Sonasītā or Sonasī.<sup>48</sup> The river
was named Suvarṇasikatā because its sand contains particles of
gold.<sup>49</sup>
