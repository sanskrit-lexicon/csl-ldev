10. {%Palakka%}¦ (No. I, L. 20):
<div n="lb"/>It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Southern
[Page-260+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>India whose kings were first conquered and then released by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. Its ruler was Ugrasena. Palakka has been
<div n="lb"/>identified with Palakkaḍa, the capital of a Pallava viceroyalty
<div n="lb"/>and was situated in the Nellore district.<sup>632</sup> Law is inclined to
<div n="lb"/>identify Palakkaḍa with Palakalūru in the Guntur taluka.<sup>633</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Allan and G. Ramdas locate it in the Nellore district.<sup>634</sup> Smith
<div n="lb"/>places Palakka in the Nellore district.<sup>635</sup> Dubreuil, however,
<div n="lb"/>identifies Palakka with a capital of the same name which was
<div n="lb"/>situated to the South of the Krishna and which is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in many Pallava Copper Plates.<sup>636</sup> The kingdom of Palakka
<div n="lb"/>might have extended westwards beyond the region now occu-
<div n="lb"/>pied by the districts of Auddepal and North Arcot.<sup>637</sup> It was
<div n="lb"/>perhaps situated to the west of Kāñcī on the Eastern Ghāṭs.<sup>638</sup>
