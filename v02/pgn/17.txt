3. {%Bhānugupta%}¦ (No. 19, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>He is known only from No. 19. His no other coin or seal has
<div n="lb"/>yet come to light. As regards the position of Bhānugupta, seve-
<div n="lb"/>ral alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a succes-
<div n="lb"/>sor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have
<div n="lb"/>included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have
<div n="lb"/>been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its
<div n="lb"/>western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānu-
<div n="lb"/>gupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like
<div n="lb"/>Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he be-
<div n="lb"/>longed to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded
<div n="lb"/>Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively
<div n="lb"/>over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to
<div n="lb"/>determine. The latter view seems more probable and this in-
<div n="lb"/>ternal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the
<div n="lb"/>empire.<sup>117</sup> Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to
<div n="lb"/>his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and
<div n="lb"/>we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial
<div n="lb"/>family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta
<div n="lb"/>empire.<sup>118</sup>
<div n="P"/>His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bhānu’.
