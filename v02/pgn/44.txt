The first part is Mahendra, i.e., the great Indra and the second
is ‘giri’, which means a mountain. It is also an honorific name
later on given to one of the ten orders of the Das-nami Gosains
(founded by ten pupils of Śaṅkarācārya; the word giri is added
to the name of each member).<sup>27</sup> We also find it used with the
names of ascetics.
