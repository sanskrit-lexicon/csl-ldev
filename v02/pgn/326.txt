13. {%Mleccha%}¦ (No. 14, L. 4):
According to Sircar<sup>332</sup> Fleet conjectures the reading to be
Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after {%‘ni’%} are not legible.
So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any
doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies
defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war
with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hūṇas
which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription.
Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hūṇas or were a
[Page-150+ 39]
different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that
Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.<sup>333</sup> The fact
that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the
Hūṇas and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling
fortunes of the family supports the identification.
<div n="P"/>We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by
the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play {%Mudrā-Rākṣasa%} written
by Viṣākhadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be
protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue
by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written
after the Rāmagupta episode and probably the word Mleccha
in this context alludes to the Śakas who were suppressed by
Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasvāminī.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar<sup>334</sup> is of the view that Mleccha is the name
applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the
Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have
been any general term for a foreigner. But as the {%Dāsa, Dasyu,%}
{%Barbara,%} and {%Mleccha%} became more or less absorbed in Āryan
civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms
was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for
any foreigner.<sup>335</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and
western Ānavas. In course of time it came to be used for almost
any non-Āryan and even for Āryans of impure speech. Subse-
quently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was
after most of the Ānavas had become assimilated.<sup>336</sup> When not
used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is
used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived
from the root {%§mlich~mlech,%}<sup>337</sup> meaning to speak indistinctly
(like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit).
We find the use of root in Mahābhāṣya.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct
speech of some non-Āryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (proto-
Tibetan) {%mltśe%} “tongue”, Old Bodish {%ltśe,%} Kukish generally
{%mlei,%} the combination of initial consonants ({%mltś%} — ) being
simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages.
Aspiration cannot occur after {%I%} in old Bodish; and the proto-
Bodish form may have been {%mltse%} for all we know, so the {%‘cch’%}
of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate
[Page-151+ 39]
than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages.
Since {%‘mleche’%} would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit,
{%mleccha%} would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to
it”.<sup>339</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mleccha<sup>340</sup> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>341</sup> in the
sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the brāhmaṇas are for-
bidden to use barbarian speech. The example<sup>342</sup> given of such
speech is {%“he' layo”,%} explained by Sāyaṇa as {%“he' rayaḥ”,%} “ho,
foes”. The barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though
not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speech.<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and
Śabaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.<sup>344</sup> The Jain Prajñāpanā
records two divisions of the people of India — {%Milikkha%} and
Ārya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of
which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hoṇa, Romaya,
Pārasa and Khasa.<sup>345</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>346</sup> states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the
Yavana, Cīna and Kamboja countries. In a dual between
Karṇa and Śalya, Karṇa highly condemns the people of the
Vāhīka and especially of the Madra Country and describes
them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.<sup>347</sup>
They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant
about the Dharma (righteous conduct).<sup>348</sup> At another place,
it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they
follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy)
yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Vāhīkas and
the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.<sup>349</sup> This makes it
clear that the people not following the righteous conduct
according to the Āryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign,
were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Mahābhārata<sup>350</sup> shows that
the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas
and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas
as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and
describes them as fierce and cruel.<sup>351</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the {%Manu-Smṛti%}<sup>352</sup> the king is advised to exclude at
deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds,
the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and
deformed. At another place in the {%Manu-Smṛti%} where the girls
bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called
[Page-152+ 39]
after the {%Antyas%} or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake,
or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage,
Kullūka, the commentator on Manu explains the word {%Antya%} as
representing the Mlecchas.<sup>353</sup> From the Manu<sup>354</sup> it is clear
that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the Āryans.
<div n="P"/>The {%Vāyu, Matsya%} and {%Brahmāṇḍa%} Purāṇas state that the
seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.<sup>355</sup>
In the {%Varāha Purāṇa,%} a place named Lohārgala is stated to be
ruled over by the Mleccha kings.<sup>356</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Amara-kośa<sup>357</sup> describes the Kirātas, Śabaras and
Pulindas as the {%Mlecchajātis.%} The Bṛhat-Saṃhitā<sup>358</sup> places
them in the West and describes them as unrighteous. It places
them under the jurisdiction of {%Maṅgala graha%}<sup>359</sup> and assigns
them the region of {%Rāhu graha,%} inhabiting the mountain-tops,
low-regions or the caves.<sup>360</sup> In the ‘life’ of Hiuen Tsang, all
places to the north of Lamgham district have been described as
{%Mi-li-ku,%} i. e. frontier or Mleccha lands.<sup>361</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Ārya-mañjūśrī-Mūla-kalpa, the Mlecchas frequently
appear as the companions of robbers.<sup>362</sup> In the Kathāsarit-
Sāgara,<sup>363</sup> the Mlecchas are connected with Sindh. They are
stated to have killed brāhmaṇas, interfered with sacrifices, and
carried off the daughters of hermits.<sup>364</sup> The Rājataraṅgiṇī<sup>365</sup>
mentions the Mlecchas as issuing forth from the valleys adjoin-
ing the Himalayas.
<div n="P"/>In medieval inscriptions, the name Mleccha has been applied
indiscriminately to all foreigners.<sup>366</sup> The Mleccha army of the
Gwalior Praśasti of Bhoja consisted of the Arabs.<sup>367</sup> The
Mlecchas of the inscriptions of the medieval period refer to
Muhammadans and the people of Baluchistan.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Siddhānta-Kaumudī<sup>369</sup> describes the {%Kṣudhunas%} as the
Mlecchas. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra (a work of the 17th
century), we get reference to the Mleccha (verse 24), Mahām-
leccha (verses 28, 30) and {%Mleccha-mārga%} (verse 31) where they
are mentioned along with Pāñcāla, Kāmboja and Bāhlīka and
the Khurāśan country is described as the {%Mleccha-mārga.%}<sup>370</sup>
