(2) {%Ayodhyā%}¦ (No. 21, L. 1; No. 37, L. 6; No. 39, L. 10):
<div n="lb"/>In No. 21 the word ‘Ayodhyā-Vāsaka’ occurs<sup>355</sup> while in No. 37
<div n="lb"/>and 39 the word ‘Āyodhyaka’ has been mentioned. In No, 21,
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā is described as a victorious camp. full of great ships,
<div n="lb"/>and elephants and horses. In No. 39 certain brāhmaṇas belong-
<div n="lb"/>ing to Ayodhyā, living in the vicinity of Mahādeva Śaileśvara
<div n="lb"/>are named and are mentioned as belonging to various gotras
<div n="lb"/>and caraṇas, and as proficient in observants, in sacred duty,
<div n="lb"/>in the mantras, the sūtras, bhāṣyas and pravacanas.<sup>356</sup>
<div n="P"/>It has been venerated as one of the most important and
<div n="lb"/>holy places of the Hindus.<sup>357</sup> Vinītā was another name for
<div n="lb"/>this city.<sup>358</sup> Its other names including Viṇīā (Vinītā) are men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the Vividhatīrthakalpa.<sup>359</sup> Fa-Hsien calls it Sha-che
<div n="lb"/>and Ptolemy knew it as Sogeda.<sup>360</sup> Ayodhyā and Sāketa have
<div n="lb"/>been treated by many writers as being identical. Csoma de
<div n="lb"/>kōrös<sup>361</sup> calls this place as “Sāketan or Ayodhyā” and H.H.
<div n="lb"/>Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṃśa<sup>362</sup> confirm it.
<div n="lb"/>The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a
<div n="lb"/>synonym for Ayodhyā,<sup>363</sup> but in the Buddhist literature we find
<div n="lb"/>separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates
<div n="lb"/>doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed
<div n="lb"/>separately.<sup>364</sup> V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring
<div n="lb"/>in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṃhitā,<sup>365</sup> to show
<div n="lb"/>that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in
<div n="lb"/>the passage to support the view.
<div n="P"/>The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū
<div n="lb"/>river.<sup>366</sup> During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into
[Page-237+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala.
<div n="lb"/>The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two pro-
<div n="lb"/>vinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.<sup>367</sup> Ancient
<div n="lb"/>tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and
<div n="lb"/>his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence
<div n="lb"/>of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas,
<div n="lb"/>followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire.
<div n="lb"/>Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tion from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed
<div n="lb"/>two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained
<div n="lb"/>more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures
<div n="lb"/>along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of
<div n="lb"/>the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta
<div n="lb"/>camp of victory. The history of the city in the post-
<div n="lb"/>Gupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the
<div n="lb"/>empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>is described by Muslim historians<sup>369</sup> to have been a wilder-
<div n="lb"/>ness.
<div n="P"/>The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subse-
<div n="lb"/>quently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh.
<div n="lb"/>It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from
<div n="lb"/>Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town
<div n="lb"/>in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later
<div n="lb"/>Chronicles.<sup>370</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are
<div n="lb"/>several places in the city connected with different events in the
<div n="lb"/>life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At
<div n="lb"/>Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with
<div n="lb"/>the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son.
<div n="lb"/>At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the
<div n="lb"/>horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍapa, he held his Council,<sup>371</sup> at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad,
<div n="lb"/>his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared
<div n="lb"/>in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>the blind Ṛṣi's son, at Majhaurā in the district of Fyzabad.<sup>372</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of
[Page-238+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and
<div n="lb"/>and Aurangzeb are notable.<sup>373</sup> At present this city forms a
<div n="lb"/>part of the district of Fyzabad.
