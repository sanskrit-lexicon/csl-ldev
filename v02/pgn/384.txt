(2) {%Ayodhyā%}¦ (No. 21, L. 1; No. 37, L. 6; No. 39, L. 10):
In No. 21 the word ‘Ayodhyā-Vāsaka’ occurs<sup>355</sup> while in No. 37
and 39 the word ‘Āyodhyaka’ has been mentioned. In No, 21,
Ayodhyā is described as a victorious camp. full of great ships,
and elephants and horses. In No. 39 certain brāhmaṇas belong-
ing to Ayodhyā, living in the vicinity of Mahādeva Śaileśvara
are named and are mentioned as belonging to various gotras
and caraṇas, and as proficient in observants, in sacred duty,
in the mantras, the sūtras, bhāṣyas and pravacanas.<sup>356</sup>
<div n="P"/>It has been venerated as one of the most important and
holy places of the Hindus.<sup>357</sup> Vinītā was another name for
this city.<sup>358</sup> Its other names including Viṇīā (Vinītā) are men-
tioned in the Vividhatīrthakalpa.<sup>359</sup> Fa-Hsien calls it Sha-che
and Ptolemy knew it as Sogeda.<sup>360</sup> Ayodhyā and Sāketa have
been treated by many writers as being identical. Csoma de
kōrös<sup>361</sup> calls this place as “Sāketan or Ayodhyā” and H.H.
Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of
Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṃśa<sup>362</sup> confirm it.
The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a
synonym for Ayodhyā,<sup>363</sup> but in the Buddhist literature we find
separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates
doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed
separately.<sup>364</sup> V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring
in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṃhitā,<sup>365</sup> to show
that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in
the passage to support the view.
<div n="P"/>The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the
Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū
river.<sup>366</sup> During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into
[Page-237+ 39]
Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala.
The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two pro-
vinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.<sup>367</sup> Ancient
tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and
his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence
of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas,
followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire.
Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscrip-
tion from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed
two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained
more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures
along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of
the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of
Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta
camp of victory. The history of the city in the post-
Gupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the
empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā
is described by Muslim historians<sup>369</sup> to have been a wilder-
ness.
<div n="P"/>The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subse-
quently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh.
It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from
Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom
Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town
in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later
Chronicles.<sup>370</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are
several places in the city connected with different events in the
life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At
Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with
the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son.
At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the
horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇ-
ḍapa, he held his Council,<sup>371</sup> at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad,
his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared
in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa,
the blind Ṛṣi's son, at Majhaurā in the district of Fyzabad.<sup>372</sup>
Ayodhyā engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of
[Page-238+ 38]
whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and
and Aurangzeb are notable.<sup>373</sup> At present this city forms a
part of the district of Fyzabad.
