2. {%Kurama(ā)ravyabhaṭṭa%}¦ (No. 39, L. 5):
He is mentioned as a teacher of Chandoga ({%Veda%}), with the
{%gotras%} Aśva and Vājin. {%Kuramā%} means bad (or misused) wealth
and {%‘ravya’%} means ‘famous’; bhaṭṭa is a surname added to the
names of scholarly brāhmaṇas. So the whole expression may
mean ‘a teacher who is known for the ill use of his wealth’.
Though such queer names are actually in practice it is not un-
likely that in the present case it is the nick-name which has
been mentioned.
