 {%Deśa%}¦
It means a province, country, kingdom.<sup>178</sup> Sometimes it is
used as a technical territorial term. But its exact meaning
and bearing are difficult to explain due to the fact that
sometimes it is described as bigger and at others smaller
than other geographical divisions, such as maṇḍala, rāṣṭra and
viṣaya.<sup>179</sup> We find only one reference each in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>180</sup>
and the Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā.<sup>181</sup> The passage in the Vājasaneyī
Saṃhitā is significant in as much as here for the first time,
deśa is used in the sense of a ‘country’. We find a refer-
ence to the river Sarasvatī as flowing in the Madhyadeśa or
‘Middle Country’. The term was much in vogue in the
Upaniṣad and Sūtra period denoting therein the meaning
‘land’.
