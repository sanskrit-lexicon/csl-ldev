<div n="lb"/>It means a province, country, kingdom.<sup>178</sup> Sometimes it is
<div n="lb"/>used as a technical territorial term. But its exact meaning
<div n="lb"/>and bearing are difficult to explain due to the fact that
<div n="lb"/>sometimes it is described as bigger and at others smaller
<div n="lb"/>than other geographical divisions, such as maṇḍala, rāṣṭra and
<div n="lb"/>viṣaya.<sup>179</sup> We find only one reference each in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>180</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā.<sup>181</sup> The passage in the Vājasaneyī
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā is significant in as much as here for the first time,
<div n="lb"/>deśa is used in the sense of a ‘country’. We find a refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence to the river Sarasvatī as flowing in the Madhyadeśa or
<div n="lb"/>‘Middle Country’. The term was much in vogue in the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad and Sūtra period denoting therein the meaning
<div n="lb"/>‘land’.
