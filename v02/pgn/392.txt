(2) {%Bhāraḍidasamada%}¦ (No. 39, L. 11):
<div n="lb"/>It is the name of a village. The name of the place where the
<div n="lb"/>liṅga containing the inscription was found is said to be
<div n="lb"/>Bhārādhī Ḍīh,<sup>396</sup> Bhāraḍī of our inscription may also be com-
<div n="lb"/>pared with ‘bharaḍiya’ of the Sāñcī stūpa inscription.<sup>397</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Samada is possibly Samudra, an epithet for Siva. D.C. Sircar
<div n="lb"/>takes ‘Samudra’ to be the ‘nām-aika-deśa of a deity called
<div n="lb"/>Samuderśvara’ and suggests that the relevant passage is to be
<div n="lb"/>corrected as {%‘pārago bharaḍida-samudreśvara’.<sup>398</sup>%} The meaning
<div n="lb"/>of the passage is difficult to explain.
