<div n="lb"/>statesmanship; beloved of (his) kinsmen; the relative, as it were,
<div n="lb"/>of (his) subjects; the remover of the afflictions of (his) con-
<div n="lb"/>nections; pre-eminently skilful in destroying the ranks of (his)
<div n="lb"/>proud enemies.<sup>42</sup> Varman is a kṣatriya surname meaning
