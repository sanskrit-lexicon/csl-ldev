14. {%Viṣṇugupta%}¦ (No. 38, L. 4):
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇugupta is mentioned here as a {%Paramabhāgavata%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%Mahārājādhirāja.%} He was the son and successor of Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta III who in his turn was the son and successor of
<div n="lb"/>Narasiṃhagupta. Unfortunately the name of the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇugupta (and the wife of Kumārgupta III) has been lost in
<div n="lb"/>the portion of the last line.
<div n="P"/>The Kalighat hoard<sup>105</sup> contained besides Candragupta II's
<div n="lb"/>coins those of Narasiṃhagupta, Kumāragupta III and Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>gupta. Altekar identified Viṣṇugupta of the coins with the
<div n="lb"/>homonymous ruler of the later Gupta family of Magadha,
<div n="lb"/>who flourished in the eighth century A.D.<sup>106</sup> At that time the
<div n="lb"/>learned professor had no knowledge of this seal of an earlier
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇugupta.
<div n="P"/>His name is clearly based on god Viṣṇu.
