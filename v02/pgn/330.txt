17. {%Sāhānuṣāhi%}¦<sup>416</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>Ṣāhānuṣāhis are also mentioned to have paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta along with other tribes. The Ṣāhānuṣāhis are
<div n="lb"/>to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The
<div n="lb"/>title {%‘Sāhānuṣāhi (śahān-śāh)%} has frequently been used by the
<div n="lb"/>Sassanian kings.<sup>417</sup> The contemporary Sassanian emperor was
<div n="lb"/>Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).<sup>418</sup> The Sassanians are known to
<div n="lb"/>have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.<sup>419</sup> Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan.
<div n="lb"/>His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat
<div n="lb"/>against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was
<div n="lb"/>the starting point for a new era (A.D. 208).<sup>420</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>421</sup> confuses the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa. But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The
<div n="lb"/>Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they
<div n="lb"/>had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.<sup>422</sup> The Pārasīkas
<div n="lb"/>of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.<sup>423</sup> Though the possibility of a
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that
<div n="lb"/>at the time of Samudragupta,<sup>424</sup> three kings the Daivaputra (the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa),
<div n="lb"/>and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling indepen-
<div n="lb"/>dently.<sup>425</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>426</sup> traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and
<div n="lb"/>Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’. But this is
<div n="lb"/>far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected
<div n="lb"/>with Sādhanika the name of an officer in the administration of
<div n="lb"/>the early medieval period.<sup>427</sup>
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sassanian title Śahan-Śāh was
<div n="lb"/>used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage
<div n="lb"/>continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or
[Page-158+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>receiving some person respectively.
