2. {%Baṭṭasvāmin%}¦ (No. 43, L. 7):
The word {%Bhaṭṭa%} literally means ‘lord’ (from {%bhartṛ%}). It is a
title of respect but is also affixed to the names of learned
brāhmaṇas. Here it has been used as the first part of the name
while in other examples we find it used as a second part of the
name. Bhaṭṭasvāmin is also the name of the author of a
commentary on the Arthaśāstra. The whole name literally
means ‘the lord of lords’.
