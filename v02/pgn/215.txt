2. {%Baṭṭasvāmin%}¦ (No. 43, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>The word {%Bhaṭṭa%} literally means ‘lord’ (from {%bhartṛ%}). It is a
<div n="lb"/>title of respect but is also affixed to the names of learned
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇas. Here it has been used as the first part of the name
<div n="lb"/>while in other examples we find it used as a second part of the
<div n="lb"/>name. Bhaṭṭasvāmin is also the name of the author of a
<div n="lb"/>commentary on the Arthaśāstra. The whole name literally
<div n="lb"/>means ‘the lord of lords’.
