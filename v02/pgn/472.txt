5. {%Narmadā%}¦ (No. 18, L. 3):
The above-mentioned inscription describes reign of Mahārāja
Suraśmicandra, a feudatory of Budhagupta, as governing over
the area between the rivers Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>23</sup> This is
one of the earliest inscriptional references to the river Nar-
madā.<sup>24</sup> It is mentioned as Narmados by Ptolemy.<sup>25</sup> No ex-
press reference to the Narmadā can be traced in the Vedic
literature. But the knowledge of the river is implied in the
reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>26</sup> We find from the Amarakośa<sup>27</sup> that Revā is
another name of the river Narmadā. It is likely that the
name of the chief was derived from his association with the
river.<sup>28</sup> The Raghuvaṃśa speaks of Mahiṣmatī as the capital
of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).<sup>29</sup> It has
been mentioned several times in the Mahābhārata and the
[Page-295+ 39]
Purāṇas.<sup>30</sup> The Viṣṇupurāṇa says that by chanting a mantra
addressed to the Narmadā, one does not have any fear from
serpents.<sup>31</sup> The river rises in the Amarakaṇṭaka mountain and
falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmadā
with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.<sup>32</sup> According to
the Purāṇas it flows from a Ṛkṣvat (a part of the Vindhyan
range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from
the Vindhya itself.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is stated in the Kūrma and Matsya Purāṇas that a man
who commits suicide at any tīrtha on the Narmadā or on the
Amarakaṇṭaka does not return to this world.<sup>34</sup> Several rivers
such as Kapilā, Viśalyā, Eraṇḍī, Ikṣunadī and Kāverī<sup>35</sup> are
mentioned as falling into the Narmadā.
