7. {%Miduvilāla-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>The field belonged to Miduvilāla. The word Midu is a Prakritic
<div n="lb"/>form of Sanskrit Mṛdu<sup>504</sup> which means soft, delicate or beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful. Pāia-Sadda-Mahaṇṇavo<sup>505</sup> takes Vilāla, Birāla, Biḍāla,
<div n="lb"/>Bilāḍa and Bilāla as synonymous words meaning ‘a cat’. Ac-
<div n="lb"/>cording to Bhattacharya ‘the word vilāla is evidently derived
<div n="lb"/>from vila with its peculiar meaning (a large watery hollow)
<div n="lb"/>current in Bengal.<sup>506</sup> D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic
<div n="lb"/>caste like vardhaki (carpenter).<sup>507</sup> We find the word Vilāla
<div n="lb"/>occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has
<div n="lb"/>been translated by the editor of the grant as follows:
<div n="P"/>(a) Miduvilāla-kṣetra (L. 19): The field of Miduvilāla
<div n="P"/>(b) Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavilāla
<div n="P"/>(c) Gaṇeśvara-Vilāla-Puṣkariṇī (L. 28): the large marshy
<div n="lb"/>pond of Gaṇeśvara.
<div n="P"/>All the three names have been explained according to their
<div n="lb"/>context in this work.
<div n="P"/>In (a) and (b) the editor takes vilāla as a part of the names
<div n="lb"/>Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vilāla as ‘a large
[Page-251+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvi-
<div n="lb"/>lāla and Pakkavilāla as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or
<div n="lb"/>Vilāla as an adjective of Gaṇeśvara and not that of Puṣkariṇī.
<div n="lb"/>Vilāla seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which
<div n="lb"/>if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gaṇeśvara
<div n="lb"/>vilāla, the word vilāla seems to be an adjective of the name
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇeśvara rather than a part of it. Here the word vilāla seems
<div n="lb"/>to indicate a professional caste. It is a Dravidian word.<sup>508</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>whole sense of the name ‘Miduvilāla’ is not clear.
