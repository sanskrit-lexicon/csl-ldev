7. {%Miduvilāla-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 19):
The field belonged to Miduvilāla. The word Midu is a Prakritic
form of Sanskrit Mṛdu<sup>504</sup> which means soft, delicate or beauti-
ful. Pāia-Sadda-Mahaṇṇavo<sup>505</sup> takes Vilāla, Birāla, Biḍāla,
Bilāḍa and Bilāla as synonymous words meaning ‘a cat’. Ac-
cording to Bhattacharya ‘the word vilāla is evidently derived
from vila with its peculiar meaning (a large watery hollow)
current in Bengal.<sup>506</sup> D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic
caste like vardhaki (carpenter).<sup>507</sup> We find the word Vilāla
occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has
been translated by the editor of the grant as follows:
<div n="P"/>(a) Miduvilāla-kṣetra (L. 19): The field of Miduvilāla
<div n="P"/>(b) Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavilāla
<div n="P"/>(c) Gaṇeśvara-Vilāla-Puṣkariṇī (L. 28): the large marshy
pond of Gaṇeśvara.
<div n="P"/>All the three names have been explained according to their
context in this work.
<div n="P"/>In (a) and (b) the editor takes vilāla as a part of the names
Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vilāla as ‘a large
[Page-251+ 39]
marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvi-
lāla and Pakkavilāla as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or
Vilāla as an adjective of Gaṇeśvara and not that of Puṣkariṇī.
Vilāla seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which
if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gaṇeśvara
vilāla, the word vilāla seems to be an adjective of the name
Gaṇeśvara rather than a part of it. Here the word vilāla seems
to indicate a professional caste. It is a Dravidian word.<sup>508</sup> The
whole sense of the name ‘Miduvilāla’ is not clear.
