1. {%Acyutanandin%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>He is included in the list of kings of Āryyāvartta forcefully
<div n="lb"/>uprooted by Samudragupta. Acyuta is the name of Viṣṇu or
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa,<sup>12</sup> and Nandin is the name of an attendant of Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>also the name of Śiva's bull.<sup>13</sup> So literally the expression would
<div n="lb"/>mean ‘one who is a servant of god Visṇu’. Nandin also means
<div n="lb"/>gladdening or rejoicing.<sup>14</sup> So it may also mean ‘one who
<div n="lb"/>pleases or wins over god Viṣṇu’.
<div n="P"/>Acyutanandin seems to have been a ruler of Ahicchatra
[Page-041+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>(near Bareilly district).<sup>15</sup> The Purāṇas give names ending in
<div n="lb"/>‘Nandin’ in the list of Nāga kings and coins bearing ‘Acyuta’
<div n="lb"/>have been found from Ahicchatra.<sup>16</sup> Therefore, it is possible
<div n="lb"/>that Ahicchatra was a seat of government of Acyutanandin.
