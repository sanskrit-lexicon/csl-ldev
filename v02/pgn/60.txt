3. {%Damana%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
A ruler of Eraṇḍapalla who was one of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kings
conquered by Samudragupta. We get this name in the Mahā-
bhārata and the Purāṇas. Literally the word daman means
‘taming, subduing, overpowering’;<sup>51</sup> hence the name may mean
‘one who subdues or overpowers others’.
