 {%Kṣetra%}¦
<div n="P"/>Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its
use survives, kṣetra came to be used as a place-name suffix
as we find in the word Kurukṣetra. As a suffix in com-
position it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it.
For example karma-kṣetra, dharma-kṣetra, raṇa-kṣetra, siddha-
kṣetra, sureśvarī-kṣetra.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of this word<sup>481</sup> in the Ṛgveda points clearly to the
existence of separate fields<sup>482</sup> carefully measured off,<sup>483</sup> though
in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating culti-
vated land generally.<sup>484</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>485</sup> and later, the
sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more
general use is also found.<sup>486</sup> The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,<sup>487</sup> ‘Lord
of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presid-
ing over each field, just as Vāstoṣpati presides over each
dwelling.<sup>488</sup>

<div n="P"/>Kṣetra is changed into:<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Chatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahichatra
<div n="P"/>(b) Cchatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahicchatra.
<div n="P"/>In Prakrit Kṣetra changes to Kheṭṭa meaning ‘a land for
agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.<sup>490</sup>
<div n="P"/>Analogous to Kheṭṭa is the word ‘kheḍa’ or ‘kheṭa’ which
means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.<sup>491</sup> ‘Kheṭa’
meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pāṇini (VI. 2. 126).<sup>492</sup>
The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra defines ‘Kheṭa’ as the half of a
city and the grāma as the half of a ‘Kheṭa’.<sup>493</sup> According to
Monier Williams Kheṭa means a village, residence of peasants
and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).<sup>494</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lele<sup>495</sup> considers Kheṭa or Kheṭaka to be the dialectic form
of the word ‘Kṣetra’. The original meaning of Kheṭaka or Kheṭa
was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral
camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Kheṭaka
came to include agricultural village.<sup>496</sup>
<div n="P"/>Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscri-
ptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the
names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part
of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do
not discuss them in the context of personal-names. Some of
the names sound curious and at places the readings are doubt-
ful, the fascimile of the grant supplied by the editor being
blurred. It is interesting to note that all these names occur
in the same inscription, i. e. Gunaighar Grant of Vainya-
gupta, year 188 (No. 52). Gunaighar formerly Guṇikāgra-
hāra,<sup>497</sup> is a village about 18 miles to the north-west of the
town of Comilla, a mile and a half to the south west of the P.S.
Debidvar in the district of Tippera which is modern Tripur.<sup>498</sup>
The area is predominated by Tibeto-Burman tribes. Hence
some of the names are full of tribal vocabulary.<sup>499</sup>
