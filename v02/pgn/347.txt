4. {%Kṛmilā%}¦ (No. 40, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the
<div n="lb"/>charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centu-
<div n="lb"/>ries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the
<div n="lb"/>existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name
<div n="lb"/>in the fourth century.<sup>122</sup> But certain old seals found at Nālandā
<div n="lb"/>prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of
<div n="lb"/>Bihar.<sup>123</sup> The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from
<div n="lb"/>one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far
<div n="lb"/>from Valgūdar.<sup>124</sup> The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.<sup>125</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṃśa,<sup>126</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Vayu Purāṇa<sup>127</sup> and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>128</sup> Kṛmi, the son
<div n="lb"/>of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen
<div n="lb"/>Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an
<div n="lb"/>inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā.
<div n="lb"/>Malālasekera<sup>130</sup> recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and
<div n="lb"/>Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā.
<div n="lb"/>Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā),
<div n="lb"/>and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant
<div n="lb"/>Kirmilā.<sup>131</sup> Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were
<div n="lb"/>preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of
<div n="lb"/>Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages
<div n="lb"/>of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city
<div n="lb"/>stood.<sup>132</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>133</sup> opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with
<div n="lb"/>Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence
<div n="lb"/>to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to
<div n="lb"/>in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.<sup>134</sup> According to this
<div n="lb"/>commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But
<div n="lb"/>now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region
<div n="lb"/>which may be due to a change in the course of the river dur-
<div n="lb"/>ing so many centuries. The city was not very important and
<div n="lb"/>may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find
[Page-218+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā. According to Pandey<sup>135</sup> the name of the modern villa-
<div n="lb"/>ge Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is
<div n="lb"/>not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that
<div n="lb"/>locality.
<div n="P"/>Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā
<div n="lb"/>with Valgūdar<sup>136</sup> and seems to prefer the claim of modern
<div n="lb"/>Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.<sup>137</sup> But in the
<div n="lb"/>district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of
<div n="lb"/>Dr. Pandey.
<div n="P"/>The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place
<div n="lb"/>full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is
<div n="lb"/>sometimes also written as Krimi.<sup>138</sup>
