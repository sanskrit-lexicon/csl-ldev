3. {%Vīrasena%}¦ (No. 6, L. 4):
<div n="lb"/>Hailing from Pāṭaliputra he was Candragupta II's minister
<div n="lb"/>for peace and war by hereditary right<sup>60</sup> and accompanied the
<div n="lb"/>king on his far-reaching military expeditions. The first part is
<div n="lb"/>Vīra which means ‘brave’ and the second is {%‘sena’,%} the whole
<div n="lb"/>literally meaning ‘one with a brave army’. Pāṇini refers to
<div n="lb"/>{%Senānta%} names in his Aṣṭādhyāyī.<sup>61</sup> We find many such
<div n="lb"/>names as Vārisena, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa, Bhīmasena and Ugrasena.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="lb"/>U.N. Roy conjectures the possibility of the composition
<div n="lb"/>of the {%‘Praśasti’%} inscribed on the Meharauli Iron Pillar
<div n="lb"/>Inscription by Śāba alias Vīrasena who was an accomplished
<div n="lb"/>poet and a favourite minister of Candragupta II, Vikramā-
<div n="lb"/>ditya.<sup>63</sup> It is possible that he outlived his patron and when
<div n="lb"/>during a {%Dharmayātrā%} he revisited the spot where the lofty
<div n="lb"/>banner had been raised as a mark of homage to Lord Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>after the victory over the Vāhlikas, was moved to compose
<div n="lb"/>and inscribe this {%Praśasti%} on the Meharauli Pillar.<sup>64</sup>
