11. {%Budhagupta:%}¦ (No. 54, L. 1; No. 55, L. 2; No. 18, L. 2;
No. 33, L. 1; No. 53, L. 8):
Nos. 54, 55, 18 and 33 respectively mention him as reigning in:
[Page-026+ 39]
G.Y. 157, 159, 163 and 165. No. 33 gives his titles as {%‘parama-%}
{%daivata’, ‘paramabhaṭṭāraka’%} and {%‘mahārājādhirāja’.%} In No. 53
he is mentioned as the son of Pūrugupta born of the queen
Candradevī.<sup>96</sup> In No. 55 his title is {%Mahārājādhirāja.%} Accord-
ing to Sircar there is no space for the name of any other
Gupta prince between Pūrugupta and Bhudhagupta and their
relationship is clearly mentioned by the word {%‘putra’%} occurring
at the end of line 6.<sup>97</sup> In other words pūrugupta was the
father of Budhagupta.
<div n="P"/>In his description of Nālandā, Hiuen Tsang says that the
monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the
successive endowments of Śakrāditya, Budhagupta, Tathāgata-
gupta and Bālāditya.<sup>98</sup> On the strength of this statement it has
been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kumāragupta I
who had the title of {%Mahendrāditya%} (Mahendra = Śakra).<sup>99</sup>
In view of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of
Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.<sup>100</sup>
The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not
on sound history, or else his Budhagupta is not to be identified
with Budhagupta of the Imperial Gupta line.
<div n="P"/>The name Budhagupta is based on Mercury. Budhism had
quite a prominent place in the time of Budhagupta. But in view
of the special leaning of Gupta kings towards the brahmanical
faith we prefer to interpret Budha as referring to Mercury
either as god Mercury (regarded as a son of Soma or the Moon)
or as the planet Mercury.<sup>101</sup>
