11. {%Budhagupta:%}¦ (No. 54, L. 1; No. 55, L. 2; No. 18, L. 2;
<div n="lb"/>No. 33, L. 1; No. 53, L. 8):
<div n="lb"/>Nos. 54, 55, 18 and 33 respectively mention him as reigning in:
[Page-026+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>G.Y. 157, 159, 163 and 165. No. 33 gives his titles as {%‘parama-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%daivata’, ‘paramabhaṭṭāraka’%} and {%‘mahārājādhirāja’.%} In No. 53
<div n="lb"/>he is mentioned as the son of Pūrugupta born of the queen
<div n="lb"/>Candradevī.<sup>96</sup> In No. 55 his title is {%Mahārājādhirāja.%} Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to Sircar there is no space for the name of any other
<div n="lb"/>Gupta prince between Pūrugupta and Bhudhagupta and their
<div n="lb"/>relationship is clearly mentioned by the word {%‘putra’%} occurring
<div n="lb"/>at the end of line 6.<sup>97</sup> In other words pūrugupta was the
<div n="lb"/>father of Budhagupta.
<div n="P"/>In his description of Nālandā, Hiuen Tsang says that the
<div n="lb"/>monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the
<div n="lb"/>successive endowments of Śakrāditya, Budhagupta, Tathāgata-
<div n="lb"/>gupta and Bālāditya.<sup>98</sup> On the strength of this statement it has
<div n="lb"/>been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kumāragupta I
<div n="lb"/>who had the title of {%Mahendrāditya%} (Mahendra = Śakra).<sup>99</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In view of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of
<div n="lb"/>Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not
<div n="lb"/>on sound history, or else his Budhagupta is not to be identified
<div n="lb"/>with Budhagupta of the Imperial Gupta line.
<div n="P"/>The name Budhagupta is based on Mercury. Budhism had
<div n="lb"/>quite a prominent place in the time of Budhagupta. But in view
<div n="lb"/>of the special leaning of Gupta kings towards the brahmanical
<div n="lb"/>faith we prefer to interpret Budha as referring to Mercury
<div n="lb"/>either as god Mercury (regarded as a son of Soma or the Moon)
<div n="lb"/>or as the planet Mercury.<sup>101</sup>
