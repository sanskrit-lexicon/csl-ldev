16. {%Saṃgohalikagrāma%}¦ (No. 43, L. 2, L. 20):
<div n="lb"/>Saṃgohālika was the name of a village. In L. 2 we get the form
<div n="lb"/>Saṃgohāli, while in L. 20, it is mentioned as Saṃgohalikā-
<div n="lb"/>grāma.<sup>432</sup> Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Gulmagandhikā-
<div n="lb"/>grāma’ in place of Saṃgohālikagrāma.<sup>433</sup> But Saṃgohālika-
<div n="lb"/>grāma is the correct form. We can compare Saṃgohāli in L. 2
<div n="lb"/>of this inscription with the letters appearing in L. 20. The first
[Page-244+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>three letters are no doubt not fully legible, but the two remain-
<div n="lb"/>ing are surely ‘lika’. Thus the name can never be Gulmagan-
<div n="lb"/>dhikā, most probably it was Saṃgohālika. Moreover, the
<div n="lb"/>context of both the lines 20 and 2 is the same.
<div n="P"/>The word gohālī when joined with the suffix ‘saṃ’ means
<div n="lb"/>‘a good gohālī’. In Inscription No. 28 the word gohālī has in
<div n="lb"/>all cases been spelt with long ‘ī’, i. e. gohālī.<sup>434</sup>
