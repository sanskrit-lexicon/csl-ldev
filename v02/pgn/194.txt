1. {%Rājyanāga%}¦ (No. 43, L. 10):
{%Rājya%} means ‘kingly, princely or royal’; it also means ‘king-
dom, country or realm’.<sup>31</sup> {%Nāga%} means serpent. So the whole
literally means ‘a royal nāga’. Nāga is prefixed as well as suffixed
to names. It shows a trend towards serpent worship. The
use of {%Rājya%} as the first part of the name is also not without
parallels.<sup>32</sup>
