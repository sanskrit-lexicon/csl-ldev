2. {%Dattadevī%}¦ (No. 4, L. 10; No. 10, L. 5; No. 12, L. 20;
No. 13, L. 4; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53, L. 3; No. 49, L. 3;
No. 50, L. 3):
She is mentioned as the wife of Samudragupta and the mother
of Candragupta II. {%Datta%} means ‘given’ or protected.<sup>119</sup> We
also find {%‘Datta’%} as the name-ending suffix for male names in
literature.
<div n="P"/>3 (a) {%Dhruvadevī%} (No. 53, L. 5; No. 12, L. 21; No. 13, L. 5;
No. 49, L. 4; No. 50, L. 4; No. 47, L. 5):
She was the mother of Kumāragupta I and the wife of Candra-
gupta II. Literally {%‘Dhruva’%} means unchangeable or constant.
It is also the name of the polar star (personified as son of
Uttāna-pāda and grandson of Manu).<sup>120</sup>
<div n="P"/>3 (b). {%Dhruvasvāminī%} (No. 42, LL. 3-4):
We come to know of Dhruvasvāminī only in No. 42. Lines 1-3
mention her as the wife of Candragupta II and the mother of
Govindagupta. As we have noticed Dhruvadevī elsewhere
appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kumāra-
gupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two
queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the
two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that
Dhruvasvāminī was another name of Dhruvadevī and Kumāra-
gupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers.
