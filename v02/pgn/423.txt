 {%Lokottaravihāra%}¦ (No. 32, L. 15):
Lokottara vihāra was possibly the proper name of some local
Buddhist monastery probably named after the Lokottaravādin
sect of the Hīnayāna form of Buddhism. The Buddhist insti-
tutions alluded to in this inscription where evidently situated at
or in the neighbourhood of Mandasor where the inscription was
found, although no place is mentioned in the record.<sup>479</sup>
