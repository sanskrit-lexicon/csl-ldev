6. {%Kosala%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
It is spelt both ways with the dental as well as with the palatal
sibilant. It is included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms
whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta.
At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified
with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur,
Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.<sup>596</sup> Its old capital
was Śrīpura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.<sup>597</sup> It
is the same as Mahā-kosala<sup>598</sup> which forms the largest unit among
the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.<sup>599</sup>
The recent excavation at Eraṇ has thrown a flood of new light
on the early history of eastern Malwa and Mahākosala between
the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period
several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the
early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas
and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the
Mahākosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by
Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built
[Page-258+ 39]
by the ruling chiefs<sup>600</sup> in different parts of Mahākosala.
Dakṣiṇa Kosala is mentioned in the Ratnāvalī (Act IV) as
having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.<sup>601</sup>
<div n="P"/>N.L. Dey<sup>602</sup> identifies Dakṣiṇa Kosala with Tosalī of
Aśoka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near
Bhuvaneśwar in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests
an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is
an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative
prefix’<sup>603</sup> in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also,
like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Dakṣiṇa
Tosala.<sup>604</sup> Dakṣiṇa Tosala consisted of a maṇḍala of the name
of Koṅgoda. In some cases by mistake the reading Dakṣiṇa
kosala is given in place of Dakṣiṇa Tosala.<sup>605</sup> But it is clear
from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate
entities. The purāṇas mention them separately.<sup>606</sup> The Kāvya-
mīmāṃṣā also makes a separate reference to the two.<sup>607</sup>
