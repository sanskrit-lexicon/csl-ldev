4. {%Kāñcī%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>The earliest epigraphic mention of Kāñcī is to be found in this
[Page-255+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>inscription. The inscription refers to Viṣṇugopa of Kāñcī as
<div n="lb"/>one of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>but reinstated in their kingdoms. Kāñcī is the same as Kāñcīpura
<div n="lb"/>or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras
<div n="lb"/>Presidency.<sup>554</sup> The kingdom of Kāñcī extended from the mouth
<div n="lb"/>of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes
<div n="lb"/>even to the Kaveri.<sup>555</sup> It is also known as Kāñcīpeḍu.<sup>556</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient his-
<div n="lb"/>tory of the Pallavas of Kāñcī (of about A.D. 250 to 355)<sup>557</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin, the Cālukya ruler in the 7th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. refers to his conquest of Kāñcīpura.<sup>558</sup> The ear-
<div n="lb"/>liest literary reference to Kāñcī is in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañ-
<div n="lb"/>jali.<sup>559</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhāṣya on Vārttika 26 to Pāṇini IV. 2. 104 men-
<div n="lb"/>tions Kāñcīpuraka (i. e. a resident of Kāñcīpura).<sup>560</sup> Hiuen
<div n="lb"/>Tsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and
<div n="lb"/>that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many here-
<div n="lb"/>ties called Nirgranthas.<sup>561</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas attach great importance to Kāñcī.<sup>562</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>included in a list of seven holy cities of India.<sup>563</sup> The Brah-
<div n="lb"/>māṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>564</sup> associates Kāñcī with Kāśī, the two forming
<div n="lb"/>the two eyes of Śiva. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya sūtra<sup>565</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that Kāñcī is a Śākta-kṣetra. In the Devībhāgavata<sup>566</sup>, Kāñcī
<div n="lb"/>is said to be a sthāna of the Devī called Annapūrṇā.<sup>567</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana Purāṇa<sup>568</sup> mentions it as the best among the cities.
<div n="lb"/>The Skandapurāṇa<sup>569</sup> counts it amongst the holy places. The
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavatapurāṇa<sup>570</sup> and the Yoginītantra<sup>571</sup> also mention it.
<div n="lb"/>In Daśakumāracaritam<sup>572</sup> it is referred to as a city of the Drāviḍa
<div n="lb"/>country.
<div n="P"/>Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. Śiva Kāñcī and Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Kāñcī form the western and eastern parts of the city, while
<div n="lb"/>the Jaina Kāñcī is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.<sup>573</sup> Of the
<div n="lb"/>temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Kāmākṣī
<div n="lb"/>temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikuṇṭha
<div n="lb"/>Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Śhiva temple of Kailā-
<div n="lb"/>śanātha.<sup>574</sup>
<div n="P"/>Apart from its religious significance Kāñcī has been a
<div n="lb"/>famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman,
<div n="lb"/>the author of the Mattavilāsa-Prahasana; Bhāravi, the author
[Page-256+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of the Kirātārjunīyam and Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumār-
<div n="lb"/>acaritam are said to have flourished here.<sup>575</sup>
<div n="P"/>The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinnāga came here to
<div n="lb"/>satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the fourth century A.D., the brāhmaṇa Mayūraśaraman,
<div n="lb"/>who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recogni-
<div n="lb"/>tion in Vedic learning.<sup>576</sup> The Ādi-guru Śaṅkarācārya establi-
<div n="lb"/>shed here the famous Pīṭha known as Kāmakotipīṭha.<sup>577</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Literally Kāñcī means a ‘girdle’. It seems to have been so
<div n="lb"/>named because it is situated like a girdle round the sea.
