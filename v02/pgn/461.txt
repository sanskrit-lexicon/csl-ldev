<div n="lb"/>The Dāmodarpur Copper Plate Inscription of the time of Bhānu-
<div n="lb"/>gupta (No. 37) records that one kulyavāpa of land was purchased
<div n="lb"/>to the north of Pañcakulyavāpaka. Literally it means ‘a plot of
<div n="lb"/>land five kulyavāpas in area: It seems to refer to a village or
<div n="lb"/>locality comprising five kulyavāpas of land.<sup>672</sup> A kulyavāpa is
<div n="lb"/>‘an area of land requiring one kulya measure of seed grains
<div n="lb"/>to be sown’.<sup>673</sup> This land measure differed in different ages and
<div n="lb"/>localities. Maity<sup>674</sup> gives this area of five kulyavāpas in terms
<div n="lb"/>of modern measurements as follows:
<div n="P"/>5 kulyavāpas = 1 pāṭaka = 192-240 bighās = 72-88 acres
<div n="lb"/>and believes the lower figures to be more correct.
