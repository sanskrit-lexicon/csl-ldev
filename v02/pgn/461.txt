4. {%Pañcakulyavāpaka%}¦ (No. 37, L. 16):
The Dāmodarpur Copper Plate Inscription of the time of Bhānu-
gupta (No. 37) records that one kulyavāpa of land was purchased
to the north of Pañcakulyavāpaka. Literally it means ‘a plot of
land five kulyavāpas in area: It seems to refer to a village or
locality comprising five kulyavāpas of land.<sup>672</sup> A kulyavāpa is
‘an area of land requiring one kulya measure of seed grains
to be sown’.<sup>673</sup> This land measure differed in different ages and
localities. Maity<sup>674</sup> gives this area of five kulyavāpas in terms
of modern measurements as follows:
<div n="P"/>5 kulyavāpas = 1 pāṭaka = 192-240 bighās = 72-88 acres
and believes the lower figures to be more correct.
