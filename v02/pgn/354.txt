 {%Airikiṇa%}¦ (No. 2, L. 25):
<div n="lb"/>It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (sva-
<div n="lb"/>bhoga-nagara).<sup>164</sup> In this context the use of the phrase ‘Sva-
<div n="lb"/>bhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal<sup>165</sup> interprets ‘sva bho-
<div n="lb"/>ganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the
<div n="lb"/>Gupta king at Eraṇ, become his direct personal possession.
<div n="lb"/>Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>Daśaratha Sharma<sup>167</sup> explains it as analogous to the word
<div n="lb"/>‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Mānasāra as a town or village inha-
<div n="lb"/>bited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.<sup>168</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma
<div n="lb"/>connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein
<div n="lb"/>with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta,
<div n="lb"/>pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the title
<div n="lb"/>of Rājan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc.
<div n="lb"/>described in verse 4.<sup>169</sup> But Sharma seems to be incorrect in
<div n="lb"/>associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription
<div n="lb"/>belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further
<div n="lb"/>description in subsequent verses.<sup>170</sup> No doubt in the Eraṇ
<div n="lb"/>Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>171</sup> the word ‘sva-viṣaya’
<div n="lb"/>an adjectival clause of Airikiṇa is used to refer to a feudatory,
<div n="lb"/>which is very clear from the inscription.
<div n="P"/>The editor<sup>172</sup> also, following Sharma, is misled and ex-
<div n="lb"/>plains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something
<div n="lb"/>like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own
<div n="lb"/>salary the revenues of the city of Airikiṇa allotted to him.<sup>173</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal
<div n="lb"/>status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean
<div n="lb"/>‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In con-
<div n="lb"/>trast, in the Earṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>174</sup> the
[Page-221+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>term ‘Sva-viṣaya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyaviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>(of king Toramāṇa) who may have been a viṣayapati, the ad-
<div n="lb"/>ministrator-incharge of Eraṇ.
<div n="P"/>Airikiṇa is the same as modern Eraṇ, the ancient Airikiṇa,
<div n="lb"/>a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of
<div n="lb"/>Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the Aśokan
<div n="lb"/>period found at Eraṇ, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form
<div n="lb"/>of the name which is Erakaña or Erakana or Erakaṇa.<sup>175</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is thus clear that Erakaña or Erakaṇa is the simplified form of
<div n="lb"/>Erikiṇa: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been
<div n="lb"/>dropped by the process of elision.<sup>176</sup> The meaning of the word
<div n="lb"/>Erikiṇa is a puzzle but its connexion with erakā ‘a kind of
<div n="lb"/>grass,<sup>177</sup> found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis.
