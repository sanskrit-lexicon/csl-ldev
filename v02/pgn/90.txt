7. {%Svayambhu (ū) deva%}¦ (No. 37, L. 4):
He has been mentioned as a Viṣayapati in the Damodarpur
copper plate inscription of Bhānugupta. Literally the name
would mean ‘self-existent god’, i.e., Brahmā. As mentioned
earlier the practice of giving names of gods to human-beings
directly is against the tradition of the Dharmasūtras.
