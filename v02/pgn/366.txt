(1) {%Ajapura%}¦ (No. 12, L. 25):
<div n="lb"/>In Inscription No. 12, we find the mention of the town of Aja-
[Page-226+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>pura. The name of the viṣaya of which it was a part has been
<div n="lb"/>damaged. Since the column bearing the inscription was origi-
<div n="lb"/>nally found in front of the northern gate of the odl fort of
<div n="lb"/>Bihar,<sup>231</sup> we can easily identify Ajapura with the modern vill-
<div n="lb"/>age of the same name in the Rājagṛha viṣaya which is not very
<div n="lb"/>far from Nālandā.<sup>232</sup> The name of the viṣaya which included
<div n="lb"/>this town can possibly be restored as Rājagṛha in the damaged
<div n="lb"/>part of the inscription.
