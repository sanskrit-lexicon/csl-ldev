7. {%Koṭṭūra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
It is mentioned as one of the Southern kingdoms conquered by
Samudragupta. Its ruler was Svāmidatta. It has been identified
by N. Dubreuil with Kothoor in Ganjam.<sup>608</sup> Banerjee counts
Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga
who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their
country.<sup>609</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Fleet Koṭṭūr (from Koṭṭapura) being a very
common Dravidian name, may be looked for in any Koṭṭūra
of note, in a mountainous part of Southern India, e. g. possibly
Koṭṭūr in the Coimbatore district, at the foot of one of the
passes in the Anaimalai Hills.<sup>610</sup> R. Sathianathaier proposes
to identify Koṭṭūra with Koṭṭūra near Tuni (E. Godavari dis-
trict) and maintains that Samudragupta did not pass through
Orissa, Ganjam and Vizagapatam<sup>611</sup> There is another
Koṭṭūra in the Vizagapatam district.<sup>612</sup> But the generally
accepted view is to identify it with Kothoor in Ganjam.
