1. {%Daṇḍa-Puṣkiṇī%}¦ (No. 52, L. 31):
<div n="lb"/>Though the reading is Daṇḍapuṣkiṇī, it is to be corrected as
<div n="lb"/>Daṇḍa-puṣkariṇī.<sup>524</sup> Daṇḍa meaning punishment or rod seems
<div n="lb"/>to be a personal name here and the puṣkariṇī was named
<div n="lb"/>after him or else it may have been in his possession.
