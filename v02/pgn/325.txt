12. {%Mālava%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11):
We know Mālava as a tribe which was subjugated along with
some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the
Mālava-gaṇa<sup>292</sup> which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal
constitution of the Mālavas’ in the sense of the event of some
formal establishment of the Mālavas’ as a tribe.<sup>293</sup> Fleet fixes
[Page-147+ 39]
it up as 57-56 B.C.<sup>294</sup> Thomas<sup>295</sup> translates the expression as
“the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gaṇa) of
the Mālavas” and adds “It was to {%gaṇa-sthiti,%} not to {%gaṇa,%} that
I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not intro-
duce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is
“the usage of the Mālava tribe.”<sup>296</sup> Thus the expression {%‘Māla-%}
{%vānām gaṇa’%} refers to the Mālavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of
the Mālava-vaṃśa which has been translated as ‘the race of
the Mālavas,<sup>297</sup> but it would be better to translate it as “the
dynasty of the Mālavas”.<sup>298</sup> It seems that this tribe had esta-
blished independent rulership and so we find the word {%‘vaṃśa’%}
used where the word {%‘gaṇa’%} could also be used<sup>299</sup>
<div n="P"/>Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Mālavas were
the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as {%‘dra’%} is changed
into {%‘ll’.%} He identifies {%Malla%} with the Malloi of the Greeks
and Mālava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of Aśva-
pati, king of the Madras, were called Mālavas after their
mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra
and Mālava were identical.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The
Bṛhatsaṃhitā mentions Madraka and Mālava separately but
side by side as people of the North.<sup>301</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Samudragupta, the Mālavas possibly lived in
Rajasthan and West Malwa<sup>302</sup> consisting of Mewar, Tonk and
adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.<sup>303</sup> They settled in
various localities in Western India after having migrated from
the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower
banks of Ravi.<sup>304</sup> Their original home was in Jhang District,
Punjab. <sup>305</sup> Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa
and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from
them.<sup>306</sup> That the Mālavas had migrated to the Jaipur region
(Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the
legend on some Mālava coins found in Rajasthan reads from
right to left as in Kharoṣṭhī, which was prevalent in the
Punjab and the north-west from very early times.<sup>307</sup> The Sikhs
of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are
still known as Mālava Sikhs, probably, because these regions
were populated by the Mālavas in ancient times.<sup>308</sup> Mālava
and Mālavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is
[Page-148+ 39]
Mālava proper while the latter is lesser Mālava with the diminu-
tive suffix {%‘ka’.%}<sup>309</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mālava is the same as {%Malloi%} of the Greeks.<sup>310</sup> Pāṇini does
not mention them by name, but his sūtra, V. 3. 117 speaks of
{%‘āyudhajīvī saṃghas’,%} or tribes living by the profession of arms,
and the Kāśikā says that amongst these saṃghas were the
Mālavas and Kṣudrakas.<sup>311</sup> The Mālava tribe is actually men-
tioned in the Mahābhaṣya of Patañjali.<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata couples the Mālavas with the Tri-
garttas,<sup>313</sup> as well as with the Śivis and Ambaṣṭhas.<sup>314</sup> But
soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajas-
than where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>315</sup>
Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the
legend. {%“Mālavānām jayaḥ”%} (victory of the Mālavas) in letters
belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According
to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the
Mālavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their
tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.<sup>316</sup> The
Mālavas came into conflict with Nahapāna's son-in-law Uṣava-
dāta who subdued them.<sup>317</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Purāṇas<sup>318</sup> the Mālavas are associated with
the Saurāṣṭras, Avantis, Ābhīras, Śūras, and Arbudas, dwell
along the Pariyātra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupi-
ed other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter
points out that even according to the Purāṇas the Mālavas
lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near pre-
sent Malwa. Mālava king were taken as vrātya and mostly
śūdra in the Purāṇas.<sup>319</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata mentions the western
(pratīcya) and northern ({%udīcya%}) sections of the Mālavas.<sup>320</sup>
But the Rāmāyaṇa locates the Mālavas in the east. <sup>321</sup> Kāma-
sūtra's commentator Jayamaṅgala, who flourished later than
the fourteenth century, says that Āvantika, which is identical
with Ujjayinī-deśa, is {%apara-Mālava.%}<sup>322</sup> This has led some
writers to suggest that Mālava proper is Daśārṇa. But Jaya-
maṅgala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.<sup>323</sup> His
remark on Mālava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier
authorities. Rājaśekhara mentions Mālava, Avanti and Vidiśā
and the Mañjūśrī mentions Mālava, Vidiśā and Daśārṇa side
[Page-149+ 39]
by side<sup>324</sup> Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayinī and
Bhilsa. The influence of the Mālavas in the Mandasor region is
proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon
the Mandasor princes.<sup>325</sup> An inscription describes the subjuga-
tion of Sapta-Mālava by Daṇḍanāyaka Anantapāla, a feudatory
of Vikramāditya VI.<sup>326</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Harṣacarita of Bāṇa refers to the ‘wicked Mālava king’
generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman
Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Rājyavardhana.
B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Prayāga
and Bhilsa which is identical with Pūrva-Mālava.<sup>327</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus the Mālavas originally belonged to Jhang District
in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all
over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated
to Rajasthan. The Mālavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an
independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience
of the Śakas in the Ist century B.C., to the western kṣatraps
from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta
in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted
itself again.<sup>328</sup> In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to
have migrated further to the east and covered the region from
Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Prayāga.<sup>329</sup> During the rule of the
Pālas of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east;
for the copper plates of the Pāla kings (excepting Dharmapāla),
refer to the Mālavas as mercenary troops in their army.<sup>330</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of
Malwa (a transformation of the word Mālava), and in the brāh-
maṇa castes called ‘Mālavīs’ or ‘Mālavikas’. They are the brāh-
maṇas of Mālava proper and the adjoining country, but are found
also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.<sup>331</sup>
