5. {%Viṣṇupada%}¦ (No. 20, L. 6):
<div n="P"/>We know from the inscription that a lofty standard of the
<div n="lb"/>divine Viṣṇu was set up on the hill called Viṣṇupada.<sup>114</sup> Liter-
<div n="lb"/>ally meaning ‘the hill marked with footprints of Viṣṇu’, Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>pada hill has been identified with that part of the Delhi Ridge
<div n="lb"/>on which the column stands.<sup>115</sup> But there is no mountain in
<div n="lb"/>Delhi and the inscription appears to have been brought there
<div n="lb"/>from the mount Viṣṇupada.<sup>116</sup> On the evidence from the
<div n="lb"/>Epics, this Viṣṇupada hill is not far from Kurukshetra and the
<div n="lb"/>Beas.<sup>117</sup>
