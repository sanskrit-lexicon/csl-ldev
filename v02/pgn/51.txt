6. {%Vyāghrarāja%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>He was the ruler of Mahākāntāra and was one of the kings of
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta. He has been identi-
<div n="lb"/>fied with the Vākāṭaka feudatory prince Vyāghra whose inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tions have been found at Nach-ne-ki-talai and Ganj in Central
<div n="lb"/>India, who is also said to have been the ruler of the Ucchakalpa
<div n="lb"/>dynasty in Bundelkhand.<sup>39</sup> But an objection to this view is
<div n="lb"/>that he must be a ruler in Dakṣiṇāpatha as mentioned in our
<div n="lb"/>inscription and has accordingly been identified with the ruler
<div n="lb"/>of Mahā-vana, a synonym of Mahā-kāntāra, also called Jeypore
<div n="lb"/>forest in Orissa.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name is based on the animal {%Vyāghra,%} or tiger imply-
<div n="lb"/>ing that in Mahākāntāra his subordinate chiefs were like tigers
<div n="lb"/>and he was their ruler. The name is a good selection in the
[Page-045+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>context of the fact that the region of Mahākāntāra is known to
<div n="lb"/>have been infested with tigers.
