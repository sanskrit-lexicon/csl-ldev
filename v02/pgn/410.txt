 {%Pallī%}¦
<div n="lb"/>The suffix — palli, pallī, pallaka or its diminutive pallikā is
<div n="lb"/>derived from §pal to go, to move.<sup>442</sup> It means a small village,
<div n="lb"/>(esp.) a settlement of wild tribes (e. g. Triśira-pallī = Trichin-
<div n="lb"/>opoly).<sup>443</sup> Pallī has been used as meaning a den of thieves in
<div n="lb"/>the Uttarādhyanasūtra and other Jain canonical texts,<sup>444</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>earliest portions of which are assigned to about 300 B.C.<sup>445</sup>

<div n="P"/>The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra by king Bhojadeva, an ele-
<div n="lb"/>venth century work, defines Pallī thus:
<div n="P"/>“Where Pulindas<sup>446</sup> live building their huts with leafs,
<div n="lb"/>branches and stones etc. is called Pallī and a small Pallī is
<div n="lb"/>called Pallīkā”.<sup>447</sup>
<div n="P"/>Its derivation from §pal to go, to move, fits in very well as
<div n="lb"/>it was an inhabitation of Ābhīras, thieves and barbarians who
<div n="lb"/>moved from one place to another and were usually in small
<div n="lb"/>number.
<div n="P"/>It seems to be a Dravidian word loaned in Sanskrit. We
<div n="lb"/>find in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada the word palli meaning
<div n="lb"/>hamlet, settlement, small village and in Telugu the words Palli
<div n="lb"/>and Palliya denoting ‘a small village’.<sup>448</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pallī<sup>449</sup> is changed into:
<div n="P"/>(a) bal: Āśāpallī, Yessabal
<div n="P"/>(b) Poli, as Triśirapallī (= Trishṇāpallī), Trichinopoly
<div n="P"/>(c) oli, as Ahalyapallī, Ahiroli (also Ahiāri).
<div n="P"/>We have only one place-name ending in this suffix, with
<div n="lb"/>a slight variation which is ‘palla’ and is detailed below:
