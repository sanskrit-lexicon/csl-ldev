(3) {%Īśvaravāsaka%}¦ (No. 5, L. 6)<sup>374</sup>:
It seems to be a village or an allotment of land granted by
Āmrakārddava, the son of Undāna, and apparently an officer
of Candragupta II to the Āryasaṃgha at the great vihāra of
Kākanādaboṭa for the purpose of feeding mendicants.<sup>375</sup> The
word Īśvara here is connected with Vāsaka and there is no infix
or place-name suffix in between (just as ‘pura’ in Ānandapura-
vāsaka). Hence vāsaka here has a double purpose. It is mean-
ingful to Īśvara and also denotes the inhabitation. The whole
will literally mean ‘an inhabitation of God’.
