(3) {%Īśvaravāsaka%}¦ (No. 5, L. 6)<sup>374</sup>:
<div n="lb"/>It seems to be a village or an allotment of land granted by
<div n="lb"/>Āmrakārddava, the son of Undāna, and apparently an officer
<div n="lb"/>of Candragupta II to the Āryasaṃgha at the great vihāra of
<div n="lb"/>Kākanādaboṭa for the purpose of feeding mendicants.<sup>375</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>word Īśvara here is connected with Vāsaka and there is no infix
<div n="lb"/>or place-name suffix in between (just as ‘pura’ in Ānandapura-
<div n="lb"/>vāsaka). Hence vāsaka here has a double purpose. It is mean-
<div n="lb"/>ingful to Īśvara and also denotes the inhabitation. The whole
<div n="lb"/>will literally mean ‘an inhabitation of God’.
