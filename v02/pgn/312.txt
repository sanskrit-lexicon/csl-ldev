6. {%Sābhāṭi%}¦ (No. 55, L. 3):
The form of the name should have better been Sabhāṭi. She
was the mother of Dāmasvāminī who raised a pillar in her
memory.

{%Sabhā.%}<sup>15</sup> It can be an adjective from the word {%Sabhā%} combined
with {%§‘aṭ’%} to move. Literally it may mean “one who moves
in assemblies”.
