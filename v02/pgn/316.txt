3. {%Āṭavika-rāja%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
It is stated in the inscription that Samudragupta made all the
kings of the forest countries his servants.<sup>76</sup> A mention
of the forest kingdoms has also been made in Khoh Copper
plate inscription of Saṃkshobha Gupta year 209.<sup>77</sup> These
18 forest kingdoms were apparently in Central India
including Ḍāhala or the Jabalpur region. <sup>78</sup> We find a refe-
rence to the same in the Kanas plate of Lokavigraha.<sup>79</sup>
The Vāyu and Matsya Purāṇas (XLV, 126 and CXIII, 48)
read Āṭavyas which is no doubt the correct reading. Āṭavī as
a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.<sup>80</sup> The
Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal
tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.<sup>81</sup> We find
[Page-129+ 39]
a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the
Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice
to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,<sup>82</sup> which
needs must influence their future advance to civilization.
Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of
forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic
List of Peoples.<sup>83</sup> Similar terms {%‘vana-rāṣṭra’%} ‘forest-countries’
and {%vana-rājya%} ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the Bṛhat-
Saṃhitā.<sup>84</sup> But these countries lay in the north-east division
of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at
any rate, not the countries referred here.<sup>85</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of
Sahadeva's {%digvijaya,%} Professor Franklin Edgerton changes
{%Āṭavī%} to {%Antākhi,%} so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome
and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately
associated in history and consequently they are still associated
in the minds of Western scholars, and hence {%Antākhi%} made
more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the
Greeks than {%Āṭavī.%} But it only represents his personal opi-
nion.<sup>86</sup>
