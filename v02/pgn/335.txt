22. {%Vāhlika%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the {%dig-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vijaya%} of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the
<div n="lb"/>first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was
<div n="lb"/>inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga count-
<div n="lb"/>ries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemi-
<div n="lb"/>es who, uniting together, came against him; — he, by whom,
<div n="lb"/>having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river)
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered; — he, by the breezes of
<div n="lb"/>whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.<sup>526</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature
<div n="lb"/>which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our
<div n="lb"/>inscription (No. 20) {%‘Vāhlikāḥ’,%} i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes
<div n="lb"/>the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on
<div n="lb"/>the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.<sup>527</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,<sup>528</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>529</sup>
<div n="lb"/>places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the
<div n="lb"/>modern Beas. The reading {%Vāhlīkān%} in the passage quoted
<div n="lb"/>from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for {%Vāhīkān.%} Numerous
<div n="lb"/>passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the
<div n="lb"/>land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>530</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%‘Vāhīka’%} was, in fact, a general term for the whole of
<div n="lb"/>Punjab. We know Śākala as {%Vāhīka-grāma%} from Patañjali and
<div n="lb"/>also {%Pātanaprastha%} which is modern Pathankot by the same
<div n="lb"/>term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara
<div n="lb"/>in his Kāvya-mīmāṃsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and
<div n="lb"/>Punjab as two separate entities. <sup>531</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the
<div n="lb"/>name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In
<div n="lb"/>the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named {%Vahi%} and {%Hika;%}
<div n="lb"/>their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation
<div n="lb"/>of Prajāpati”.<sup>532</sup>
[Page-168+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the
<div n="lb"/>tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the
<div n="lb"/>Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika,
<div n="lb"/>Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands
<div n="lb"/>of these tribes which lived close to one another became in
<div n="lb"/>course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful
<div n="lb"/>kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra
<div n="lb"/>and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its ana-
<div n="lb"/>logical connection with the word {%‘bahis’%} may have been another
<div n="lb"/>cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.<sup>533</sup> This is
<div n="lb"/>also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the
<div n="lb"/>word ‘Vāhīka’ from {%‘vahis’%} or {%‘bahis’,%} meaning ‘outside’ (the
<div n="lb"/>pale of Āryandom).<sup>534</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some scholars<sup>535</sup> rely on the description of the Bāhlikas
<div n="lb"/>as the offspring of two Piśācas, {%Bahi%} and {%Hika,%} as given in
<div n="lb"/>the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream
<div n="lb"/>of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came
<div n="lb"/>to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general
<div n="lb"/>designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as
<div n="lb"/>Vāhīka.<sup>536</sup> But we have already shown that the two were
<div n="lb"/>separate entities.
<div n="P"/>We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within
<div n="lb"/>the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu
<div n="lb"/>(Indus),<sup>537</sup> but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven
<div n="lb"/>months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).<sup>538</sup> So
<div n="lb"/>Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme
<div n="lb"/>north of Afghanistan.<sup>539</sup> Bajpai<sup>540</sup> opposes it on the ground
<div n="lb"/>that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as
<div n="lb"/>Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects
<div n="lb"/>the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling
<div n="lb"/>in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed
<div n="lb"/>the Hindukush to crush them.
<div n="P"/>But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from
<div n="lb"/>the lines in our inscription<sup>541</sup> that king Candra had conquered
<div n="lb"/>the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river
<div n="lb"/>Indus.
<div n="P"/>So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that
<div n="lb"/>Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;<sup>542</sup> here
[Page-169+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the {%Mūjavants,%} the
<div n="lb"/>{%Mahāvṛṣas,%} and the {%Balhikas.%} The Mūjavants are quite certainly
<div n="lb"/>a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun
<div n="lb"/>on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from {%bahis,%} ‘without’),<sup>543</sup>
<div n="lb"/>still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern
<div n="lb"/>tribe.<sup>544</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā<sup>545</sup> mentions a Kuru king named
<div n="lb"/>Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of
<div n="lb"/>Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name
<div n="lb"/>Balhika.<sup>546</sup> He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātī-
<div n="lb"/>peya of the Mahābhārata.<sup>547</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally
<div n="lb"/>migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question<sup>548</sup>
<div n="lb"/>says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king
<div n="lb"/>of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son
<div n="lb"/>Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the
<div n="lb"/>Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to
<div n="lb"/>rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with
<div n="lb"/>the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri<sup>549</sup>
<div n="lb"/>suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of
<div n="lb"/>Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia,
<div n="lb"/>and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to
<div n="lb"/>be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was
<div n="lb"/>earlier advocated by Roth<sup>550</sup> and Weber.<sup>551</sup> But Zimmer<sup>552</sup>
<div n="lb"/>rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian
<div n="lb"/>influence.<sup>553</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples<sup>554</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Account of fifty-six countries<sup>555</sup> is interesting as it mentions
<div n="lb"/>them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas
<div n="lb"/>among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra<sup>556</sup> Bāhlīka is
<div n="lb"/>described as famous for horses and situated to the east of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the
<div n="lb"/>basis of reference in the Mahābhārata<sup>557</sup> places the Vāhlikas
<div n="lb"/>in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.<sup>558</sup>
<div n="P"/>Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)<sup>559</sup> mentions Bāhlāyana and
<div n="lb"/>derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.<sup>560</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṃsā of Rājaśe-
<div n="lb"/>khara and the Rāmāyaṇa<sup>561</sup> place the Vāhlika country in the
[Page-170+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>northern division.<sup>562</sup> Bāhlika is the name of a person in the
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.<sup>563</sup> The Nāṭyaśāstra<sup>564</sup> of Bharata says that
<div n="lb"/>Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas).
<div n="lb"/>A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.<sup>565</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,<sup>566</sup> Bāhlīka is grouped
<div n="lb"/>with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western divi-
<div n="lb"/>sion. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men
<div n="lb"/>being married to a single woman as in {%strīrājya (strīrājye ca%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Bāhlike...%}), appears to be an outlandish custom prevailing
<div n="lb"/>in the regions to the west of India.<sup>567</sup> The Jayamaṅgalā comm-
<div n="lb"/>entary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.<sup>568</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in
<div n="lb"/>two ways:
