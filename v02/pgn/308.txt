2. {%Devakī%}¦ (No. 13, L. 13):
The reference comes in the passage which describes how
Skandagupta returned victorious to his mother just as Lord
Kṛṣṇa went to Devakī after killing his enemy. <sup>5</sup> Sewell suggests
that the name of Skandagupta's mother was Devakī and he
has been followed by some other scholars. According to D.C.
Sircar the simile may further suggest that some maternal uncle
of Skandagupta actually fought against him in support of his
rival and that his mother, possibly not the chief queen of his
father, had to experience difficulties for sometime. <sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Devakī is a patronymic formed by adding {%‘ī’%} suffix to
Devaka, literally meaning ‘divine, celestial’, who was her
father.<sup>7</sup> She was the wife of Vasudeva and the mother of
Kṛṣṇa.<sup>8</sup>
