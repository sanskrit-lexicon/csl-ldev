1. {%Parṇadatta%}¦ (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9):
He is mentioned as a ruler of Surāṣṭra appointed by Skanda-
gupta. He was the father of governor Cakrapālita. Sankalia
considers it to be an Iranian name.<sup>23</sup> But it can can very well
be an Indian name. Parṇa means a leaf and is as well the name
of a tree called Palāśa. We find ‘Parṇadatta’ to be the name
of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>24</sup> It signifies ‘a person
born as a result of the worship of the Parṇa (Palāśa) tree’.
