1. {%Abhayamitra%}¦ (No. 48, L. 2; No. 54, L. 2):
The name consisting of two parts {%‘abhaya’%} and {%‘mitra’%} can
mean a friend of unfearfulness or ‘an unfearful friend’. ‘Abhaya’
is also the name of Lord Śiva<sup>28</sup> and ‘mitra’ is a synonym for
the god Sun. Thus it may also be a name formed by combining
the names of two deities as in the case of Rāmakṛṣṇa. Abhaya-
mitra was the name of a Buddhist monk who caused a {%pratimā%}
to be built.
