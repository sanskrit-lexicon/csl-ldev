3. {%Gopadatta%}¦ (No. 37, L. 11):
The first part is {%Gopa%} and the second is {%datta.%} Gopa literally
meaning cowherd is a synonym for Lord Kṛṣṇa.<sup>25</sup> So it would
[Page-060+ 37]
mean ‘born by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa’. Names ending in datta
are common in Buddhist literature.<sup>26</sup>
