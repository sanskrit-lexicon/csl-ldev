1. {%Devarāṣṭra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 20):
<div n="P"/>It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings
ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta.
Dey<sup>16</sup> identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra).
Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas
slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with
modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.<sup>17</sup> According to R.D.
Banerjee<sup>18</sup> Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in
Kaliṅga. B.C. Law<sup>19</sup> identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of
the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Ray-
chaudhuri,<sup>20</sup> S.B. Chaudhuri,<sup>21</sup> Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.<sup>22</sup> This
view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that
Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the
eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious
difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas.
Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta
as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent
that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tām-
ralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):
<div n="P"/>L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called
Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to Mūla-
Nāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this
maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that Mūla-
Nāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The
word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a
country of the Nāgas’.
