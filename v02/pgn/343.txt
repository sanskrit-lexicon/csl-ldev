 {%Viṣaya%}¦
According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, king-
dom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural
it meant lands or possessions.<sup>63</sup> In the Aṣṭādhyāyī<sup>64</sup> it denotes
regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. Śaiba,
the region of the Śibis; Mālavaka, the region of the Mālava
people; Rājanyaka, of the Rājanya tribe and so forth. ‘The
names according to Viṣaya seem to be based on the ethnic
distribution of population over particular areas for the time
being without reference to the form of government’.<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Viṣaya in the sūtra Viṣayo deśe<sup>66</sup> is significant.
Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana and Hemacandra take it as rāṣṭra, and
Vardhamāna as Janapada. The Kāśikā takes it as grāma-samu-
dāya. Kātayāyana and Patañjali interpret Viṣaya as being
identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments
give the impression that even such geographical units as were
[Page-214+ 39]
not a janapada were called Viṣaya.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>If Viṣaya and Janapada had been identical, Pāṇini would
not have treated the former under a separate heading.<sup>68</sup> A
Viṣaya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a
Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the
Rājanyādi gaṇa, viṣaya denotes janapadas, while in the
Bhauriki and Aiṣukāri gaṇas,<sup>69</sup> it is landed property, the share
of estate which was the source of livelihood.
<div n="P"/>In the post-pāṇinian period, distinction between Janapada
and viṣaya was lost, both being called by the same names, for
example Aṅgāḥ, Vangāḥ, Sumhāḥ, and Puṇḍrāḥ. In some Jana-
padas like Rājanya, the distinction was retained, as Rājanyaka
denoted a viṣaya and Rājanyāḥ, the Janapada of the Rājanya
tribe. Similarly we have Vāsātaḥ, Vāsātayaḥ; Gandhāraḥ,
Gāndhārayaḥ; and Śaibaḥ, Śibiyaḥ. Other smaller units were
only viṣayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, Ātmakāmeyaka,
Bhaurikavidha and Aiṣukāri-bhakta.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The viṣaya usually corresponded with the district of the
modern administration.<sup>71</sup> Minor bhuktis, maṇḍalas and the
viṣayas were used to denote the same administrative division
in many cases.<sup>72</sup> The district administration was well organised
in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the
seals of the district administration.<sup>73</sup> Sealings of the district
administration of Rājagṛha and Gayā have been found at
Nālandā, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore
the impress of their official seals.<sup>74</sup>
<div n="P"/>We have the following place-names ending in Viṣaya:
