5. {%Lāṭa<sup>139</sup>%}¦ (No. 17, L. 3)
<div n="lb"/>The district or viṣaya of Lāṭa is here described as “pleasing
<div n="lb"/>with choice trees that are bowed down by the weight of (their)
<div n="lb"/>flowers, and with temples and assembly-halls of the gods, and
<div n="lb"/>with vihāras, (and) the mountains of which are covered over
<div n="lb"/>with vegetation”.
<div n="P"/>The country south of Mahī or at times south of the Nar-
<div n="lb"/>badā up to the Pūrva or so far as Daman, was called Lāṭa and
<div n="lb"/>‘it corresponded roughly with Southern Gujarat’.<sup>140</sup> It comp-
<div n="lb"/>rised the collectorates of Surat, Bharoch, Kheda and parts of
<div n="lb"/>Baroda territory.<sup>141</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Prof. Bühler, Lāṭa is Central Gujarat, the
<div n="lb"/>district between the Mahī and Kim rivers and its chief city was
<div n="lb"/>Broach.<sup>142</sup> Lāṭa has been identified with Central and Southern
<div n="lb"/>Gujarat in the Rewah Stone Inscription of Karṇa.<sup>143</sup> We also
<div n="lb"/>find the Lāṭa kingdom mentioned in other epigraphical reco-
<div n="lb"/>rds.<sup>144</sup> Lāṭarāṣṭra<sup>145</sup> is identical with the old Lāṭa kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Gujarat, the capital city of which is stated in the Dīpavaṃśa to
<div n="lb"/>have been Siṃapura (Sīhapura).<sup>146</sup> In the early days of the
<div n="lb"/>imperial Guptas, the Lāṭa country was formed into an admini-
<div n="lb"/>strative province in the Lāṭaviṣaya.<sup>147</sup> The Śaktisaṅgam Tantra
<div n="lb"/>places the Lāṭa country to the west of Avanti and to the north-
<div n="lb"/>west of Vidarbha.<sup>148</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lāṭa is the same as the Larike of Ptolemy which lay to the
<div n="lb"/>east of Indo-Scythia along the sea-coast.<sup>149</sup> The word Lāṭa is
[Page-219+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>derived from Sanskrit Rāṣṭra.<sup>150</sup> The Nāgara brāhmaṇas of
<div n="lb"/>Lāṭa (Gujarat) are said to have invented the Nāgarī character
<div n="lb"/>which is believed to have been derived from the Brāhmī alpha-
<div n="lb"/>bet.<sup>151</sup>
