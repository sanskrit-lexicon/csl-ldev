(5) {%Kartṛpura%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
<div n="P"/>Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartṛpura,
some scholars prefer to read Katṛipura<sup>262</sup> or Kātripura.<sup>263</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is one of the five frontier kingdoms<sup>264</sup> mentioned in the
inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samu-
dragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification
of this place-name:
<div n="P"/>According to smith,<sup>265</sup> this kingdom ‘occupied the lower
ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon,
Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham<sup>266</sup> holds that the kingdom of
Kātripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra.
Fleet<sup>267</sup> suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in
the Jullundur district.
<div n="P"/>We prefer the view of Daśaratha Sharma.<sup>268</sup> His conten-
tion is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in
the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth
one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside
[Page-229+ 39]
the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for
Kartṛpura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions.
Consequently he finds Karor or Karūr to be a good equivalent
for Kartṛpura.<sup>269</sup> Kara here stands for Kartṛ and ‘ur’ or ‘ūr’
would stand here for pura.<sup>270</sup> Karūr, again, is to be preferred
to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the
Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an
eastern king, called Vikramāditya, put to flight and killed a
Śaka ruler in the region of Karūr, between Multan and Loni.<sup>271</sup>
This Vikramāditya is to be identified with Candragupta II
‘the enemy of the Śakas’, who disguised as his brother's wife,
Dhruvasvāminī, ‘ripped upon the belly of the Śaka ruler’,
and destroyed the Śaka army, most probably, in Kartṛpura or
Karūr.<sup>272</sup>
<div n="P"/>This was the first encounter between the Śakas and Vikramā-
ditya, and Karūr, Karor, or Kartṛpura was the theatre of the
war because of its intermediate position between the Śaka
dominions and the Gupta empire.<sup>273</sup>
