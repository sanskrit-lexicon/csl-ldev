(5) {%Kartṛpura%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
<div n="P"/>Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartṛpura,
<div n="lb"/>some scholars prefer to read Katṛipura<sup>262</sup> or Kātripura.<sup>263</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is one of the five frontier kingdoms<sup>264</sup> mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samu-
<div n="lb"/>dragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification
<div n="lb"/>of this place-name:
<div n="P"/>According to smith,<sup>265</sup> this kingdom ‘occupied the lower
<div n="lb"/>ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon,
<div n="lb"/>Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham<sup>266</sup> holds that the kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Kātripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra.
<div n="lb"/>Fleet<sup>267</sup> suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in
<div n="lb"/>the Jullundur district.
<div n="P"/>We prefer the view of Daśaratha Sharma.<sup>268</sup> His conten-
<div n="lb"/>tion is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth
<div n="lb"/>one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside
[Page-229+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for
<div n="lb"/>Kartṛpura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions.
<div n="lb"/>Consequently he finds Karor or Karūr to be a good equivalent
<div n="lb"/>for Kartṛpura.<sup>269</sup> Kara here stands for Kartṛ and ‘ur’ or ‘ūr’
<div n="lb"/>would stand here for pura.<sup>270</sup> Karūr, again, is to be preferred
<div n="lb"/>to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the
<div n="lb"/>Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an
<div n="lb"/>eastern king, called Vikramāditya, put to flight and killed a
<div n="lb"/>Śaka ruler in the region of Karūr, between Multan and Loni.<sup>271</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This Vikramāditya is to be identified with Candragupta II
<div n="lb"/>‘the enemy of the Śakas’, who disguised as his brother's wife,
<div n="lb"/>Dhruvasvāminī, ‘ripped upon the belly of the Śaka ruler’,
<div n="lb"/>and destroyed the Śaka army, most probably, in Kartṛpura or
<div n="lb"/>Karūr.<sup>272</sup>
<div n="P"/>This was the first encounter between the Śakas and Vikramā-
<div n="lb"/>ditya, and Karūr, Karor, or Kartṛpura was the theatre of the
<div n="lb"/>war because of its intermediate position between the Śaka
<div n="lb"/>dominions and the Gupta empire.<sup>273</sup>
