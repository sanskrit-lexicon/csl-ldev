6. {%Goṣāṭapuñjaka%}¦ (No. 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):
[Page-242+ 39]
In line 2 of the inscription the reading is Goṣāṭapuñjaka while
in lines 8 and 15 the reading is Goṣāṭapuñja.
<div n="P"/>Goṣāṭa may be the same as gośālā or a cow-stall<sup>413</sup> and
puñja means a multitude.<sup>414</sup> So the village may have consisted
of a multitude, of cow-stalls and thus resembled the villages
known as gohālīs.
