3. {%Jyeṣṭhadāma%}¦ (No. 43, LL. 4-5):
The first part of the word is {%Jyeṣṭha%} literally meaning elder.
Here it may stand for Jyeṣṭha Liṅga described in the Liṅga
Purāṇa.<sup>47</sup> The second part {%dāma%} means ‘a garland’.<sup>48</sup> The whole
thus literally means, ‘a garland of Jyeṣṭha Liṅga’ and testifies
[Page-063+ 38]
to the popularity of the Jyeṣṭha Liṅga as an object of religious
reverence.
