 {%Nagara:%}¦
Nagara means a town, a city.<sup>335</sup> we find the term being
used by Pāṇini (IV. 2. 142).<sup>336</sup> The word Nāgaraka (or
Nāgarika)<sup>337</sup> also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for
‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted
for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times
nāgarika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living
in city or village’.
<div n="P"/>In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the
derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it
appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (1. 11,
18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish
Janapada from rāṣṭra: nagara forms a part of the rāṣṭra but
is excluded from the Janapada.<sup>339</sup> Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra
uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.<sup>340</sup> It is significant that
the word Nagara is of late occurrence.<sup>341</sup> It is likely
that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have
developed much. In the Epic,<sup>342</sup> there are references to
Nagara, ‘a city’: Grāma ‘Village’: and Ghoṣa ‘ranch’. Vedic
literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined
to the village. The siege of puras is mentioned in the Saṃhitās
and Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="P"/>The word Nagara is changed into:<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Nar as Kuśīnagara, Kusinar, Girinagara, Girnar
<div n="P"/>(b) Ner as Jīrṇanagara, Jooner.
<div n="P"/>In modern times the suffix nagara is sometimes used to
denote an inhabitation or Mohalla e. g. Tilak Nagar, Subhash
Nagar, Patel Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Lajapat Nagar.
<div n="P"/>We do not find any place-name with the suffix ‘nagara’ in
our records but with a little change in the same sense with the
suffix nagarī, which is given below:
