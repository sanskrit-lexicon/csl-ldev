1. {%Nāgadatta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>The first part is Nāga which refers most likely to ‘a holy ser-
<div n="lb"/>pent’ and the second is ‘datta’ meaning given. Thus the full
<div n="lb"/>name may mean ‘born by the grace of a Nāga’. D.C. Sircar
<div n="lb"/>takes the compound as a Caturthī Tatpuruṣa instance mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing ‘dedicated to a Nāga’. However, the compounds are usually
<div n="lb"/>taken as Tṛtīyā Tatpuruṣa instances. The names do not indi-
<div n="lb"/>cate towards bali but such names as Gurudatta, Śivadatta and
<div n="lb"/>Nāgadatta may exhibit reverence to Guru, Śiva or Nāga by
<div n="lb"/>whose worship or blessings the son was born which is attested
<div n="lb"/>to by tradition of such names.
