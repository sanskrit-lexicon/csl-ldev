1. {%Nāgadatta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta.
The first part is Nāga which refers most likely to ‘a holy ser-
pent’ and the second is ‘datta’ meaning given. Thus the full
name may mean ‘born by the grace of a Nāga’. D.C. Sircar
takes the compound as a Caturthī Tatpuruṣa instance mean-
ing ‘dedicated to a Nāga’. However, the compounds are usually
taken as Tṛtīyā Tatpuruṣa instances. The names do not indi-
cate towards bali but such names as Gurudatta, Śivadatta and
Nāgadatta may exhibit reverence to Guru, Śiva or Nāga by
whose worship or blessings the son was born which is attested
to by tradition of such names.
