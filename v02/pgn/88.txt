5. {%Śa (ga) ṇḍaka%}¦ (No. 36, L. 3):
D.C. Sircar takes the reading to be Gaṇḍaka which seems to
be correct.<sup>85</sup> One scholar<sup>86</sup> equates Śaṇḍaka with Saṇḍaka
which means a ‘bull’ and says that the word Gaṇḍaka yields
no sensible meaning. But Gaṇḍaka has been accepted as the
most probable reading by scholars.<sup>87</sup> Gaṇḍaka is the name of
a river in the northern part of India.<sup>88</sup> So the name Gaṇḍaka
based on the river Gaṇḍakī can be given to a person just as the
name Gaṅgā based on the river Ganges is given to a person.
Gaṇḍaka is also the name of the Videhas living on the river
Gaṇḍakī<sup>89</sup> and also refers to a rhinoceros.<sup>90</sup> It is possible
that the present name, like {%Vyāghra%} discussed elsewhere is
based on the name of an animal.
