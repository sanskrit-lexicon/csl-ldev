5. {%Śa (ga) ṇḍaka%}¦ (No. 36, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>D.C. Sircar takes the reading to be Gaṇḍaka which seems to
<div n="lb"/>be correct.<sup>85</sup> One scholar<sup>86</sup> equates Śaṇḍaka with Saṇḍaka
<div n="lb"/>which means a ‘bull’ and says that the word Gaṇḍaka yields
<div n="lb"/>no sensible meaning. But Gaṇḍaka has been accepted as the
<div n="lb"/>most probable reading by scholars.<sup>87</sup> Gaṇḍaka is the name of
<div n="lb"/>a river in the northern part of India.<sup>88</sup> So the name Gaṇḍaka
<div n="lb"/>based on the river Gaṇḍakī can be given to a person just as the
<div n="lb"/>name Gaṅgā based on the river Ganges is given to a person.
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍaka is also the name of the Videhas living on the river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍakī<sup>89</sup> and also refers to a rhinoceros.<sup>90</sup> It is possible
<div n="lb"/>that the present name, like {%Vyāghra%} discussed elsewhere is
<div n="lb"/>based on the name of an animal.
