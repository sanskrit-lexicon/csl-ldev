[Page-043+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>who had developed great power and wealth were defeated by
<div n="lb"/>king Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The other readings suggested by scholars are Puṣpamitra
<div n="lb"/>and Yudhyamitra. But a careful scrutiny will support the

<div n="lb"/>Dharmasāgara and Jayavijayāgni<sup>29</sup>, the name of the early
<div n="lb"/>king Puṣyamitra, the contemporary of Patañjali appears as
<div n="lb"/>Pusamitta and thus supports the reading Puṣyamitra.
<div n="P"/>Puṣyamitra in plural may denote the followers of king
<div n="lb"/>Puṣyamitra. Puṣyamitra, the name of a tribe in Central India,
