 {%Puṣyamitra%}¦ (No. 13, L. 11,):
The name is mentioned in plural.<sup>28</sup> It is said that Puṣyamitras
[Page-043+ 38]
who had developed great power and wealth were defeated by
king Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The other readings suggested by scholars are Puṣpamitra
and Yudhyamitra. But a careful scrutiny will support the
reading Puṣyamitra as more likely. In the passages quoted by
Bühler from the Prakrit Gāthās, ascribed to Merutuṅga,
Dharmasāgara and Jayavijayāgni<sup>29</sup>, the name of the early
king Puṣyamitra, the contemporary of Patañjali appears as
Pusamitta and thus supports the reading Puṣyamitra.
<div n="P"/>Puṣyamitra in plural may denote the followers of king
Puṣyamitra. Puṣyamitra, the name of a tribe in Central India,
is also mentioned in the Purāṇas.
