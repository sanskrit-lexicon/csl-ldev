10. {%Kumāragupta II:%}¦ (No. 48, L. 5):
Kumāragupta II was the immediate successor of Pūrugupta
in the light of the data given in two dated inscriptions, viz. the
Sarnath Buddha Stone Image inscriptions of Kumāragupta and
Budhagupta. The first (No. 48) mentions A.D. 473 as the date of
Kumāragupta who must, therefore, be taken as Kumāragupta II
and the second (No. 54) mentions A.D. 476 as the date of
Budhagupta. No. 48 records the date, Gupta year 154<sup>91</sup> when
Kumāragupta was protecting the earth.<sup>92</sup> The renovation of the
Sun temple mentioned in No 17, LL. 20-21 seems to have taken
place in his reign.<sup>93</sup> It seems that Mookerji has by mistake,
connected the reference<sup>94</sup> meant for Kumāragupta I with
Kumāragupta II.<sup>95</sup> The temple was originally constructed in the
reign of Kumāragupta I in M.S. 493 = A.D. 436 (L. 19).
