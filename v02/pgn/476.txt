9. {%Sindhu%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>The river is mentioned in connexion with the description of
<div n="lb"/>the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the
<div n="lb"/>Vāhlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river)
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu<sup>50</sup> in warfare. Sindhu in the Ṛgveda<sup>51</sup> and the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>52</sup> often means simply a ‘stream’. The Ṛgveda (VIII.
<div n="lb"/>24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavaḥ’ or ‘the seven rivers’.<sup>53</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>it is also<sup>54</sup> used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par
<div n="lb"/>excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a
<div n="lb"/>river in the Amara-kośa.<sup>55</sup> The territories adjoining it were
<div n="lb"/>famous for horses<sup>56</sup> and salt.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Per-
<div n="lb"/>sian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by
<div n="lb"/>the Ionian (= Pāṇini's Yavana) Greeks.<sup>58</sup> The word ‘India’ is
<div n="lb"/>derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.<sup>59</sup> Taking its rise
<div n="lb"/>from the snows of Western Kailāśa in Tibet, the Sindhu first
<div n="lb"/>flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and
<div n="lb"/>then takes a southward course along which lay some of the
<div n="lb"/>important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad
<div n="lb"/>high-lands, the river (Dāradī Sindhuḥ) enters the Gandhāra
<div n="lb"/>country until it receives its most important western tributary
<div n="lb"/>the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.<sup>60</sup>
<div n="P"/>The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Purāṇas along with
<div n="lb"/>the Gaṅgā, Sarasvatī, Satluj, Chinab and Yamunā.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukhāni’
<div n="lb"/>may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavaḥ’ of the Ṛgveda, i. e. the
<div n="lb"/>river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then
<div n="lb"/>be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as
<div n="lb"/>meaning a river-head.<sup>62</sup> But the translation of the expression
<div n="lb"/>as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is
<div n="lb"/>generally accepted.<sup>63</sup> The seven mouths of the river Indus
<div n="lb"/>thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries
[Page-297+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.
