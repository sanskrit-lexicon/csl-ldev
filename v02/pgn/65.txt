<div n="lb"/>or serpent-demons thought to be inhabitants of the lower
<div n="lb"/>regions.<sup>57</sup> Kadru is the name of the mother of serpents.
<div n="lb"/>Kādrava by metathesis becomes Kārddava which literally
<div n="lb"/>means ‘born of Kadru’. In south, among aboriginal people
<div n="lb"/>and lower castes, the practice of matriarchal names is well
<div n="lb"/>known. The whole term ‘Āmrakārddava’ is inexplicable as one
<div n="lb"/>word. Āmra seems to be his personal name and Kārddava his
<div n="lb"/>family title.
