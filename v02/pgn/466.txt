3. {%Uttara Kuru%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
A person named Śaṃkara is described in the inscription as
born in the region of the north, the best of countries, which
resembles (in beatitude) the land of the Northern Kurus.<sup>710</sup>
[Page-266+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Kurus had two branches, the northern and the southern.
Uttarakuru or the country of the Northern Kurus, is supposed
to be a region beyond the most northern range of the Himālaya
mountains, and is described as a country of everlasting hap-
piness.<sup>711</sup> We have discussed in details, the Kurus, in the
section on tribes. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>712</sup> mentions it as a country
situated in the North. In the later period the Uttarakurus had
only a mythical or legendary existence.
