2. {%Raivataka%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16) (the same as Ūrajayat see
Ūrjayat):
Raivataka is also mentioned in the Ādi-Parvan of the Mahā-
bhārata,<sup>84</sup> the Vividhatīrthakalpa,<sup>85</sup> the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,<sup>86</sup> the
Dohad Stone Inscription of Mahamūda,<sup>87</sup> and the Jaunpur In-
scription of Iśānavarman.<sup>88</sup> Its modern name Girnar was a
switch over to it from the city name Girinagara, i. e., ‘a city
on or at the foot of a hill’.<sup>89</sup> Raivataka derives its name
from king Revatā, the father of Revatī, (the wife of Baladeva,
Kṛṣṇa's elder brother).<sup>90</sup> Revata is supposed to have come
there from Dwārakā and lived on the hill. There is still a
tank called Revatī-kuṇḍa near Dāmodarakuṇḍa in the gorge
of the hill.<sup>91</sup> The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha in the Śiśu-
pālavadha devotes the whole of Canto IV (verses 1-68) to the
description of the Raivataka mountain. In Canto VI (verses
1-79) the poet describes the occurrence of six seasons one by
one at the mountain Raivataka.
