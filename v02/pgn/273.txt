4. {%Duḍika%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5):
He was a brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of {%Caturvedins%}
of the locality known as Padmā in the city of Indrapura. He
has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the brāh-
maṇa Devaviṣṇu, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance
of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun.
<div n="P"/>It is an abbreviated name with the ending {%“ika”%}<sup>12</sup> like
Devika for Devadatta; Yajñika for Yajñadatta and Chadika
for Chandodatta.<sup>13</sup>
[Page-090+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’<sup>14</sup> cannot be
derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found
in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia
suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit
term Dardara,<sup>15</sup> meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having
holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly
region.
<div n="P"/>We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddara-
pabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.<sup>16</sup> The
{%Daddarapabbata%} may be identified with the mountainous tract
of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south
of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the
Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls
the river {%Dāradī Sindhuḥ.%}<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of this tract, the {%Daradas%} are mentioned in the
Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up
along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow
Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by
Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's {%āśrama.<sup>18</sup>%} The Daradas are the
people, living above Peshawar.<sup>19</sup> But the basic weakness in the
suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia<sup>20</sup> is, as he himself
admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit
dictionary.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are syno-
nyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī,
or a brāhmaṇa-woman.<sup>21</sup> These are deśya words and hence
refer to local elements.
<div n="P"/>In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credu-
lous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is
not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish
approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple
person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical
brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped.
Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and
the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a
brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. {%‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’%}
or {%‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’%} a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also
used in satire.

<div n="P"/>It is interesting to note that {%Ḍaḍḍa%} is also an English slang
word meaning ‘a foolish person’.
