20. {%Śaka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to
Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion
with the Muruṇḍas, the expression, ‘Śaka-Muruṇḍa’ should
[Page-162+ 39]
not be translated to mean Śaka-lords. Following Fleet<sup>477</sup>
we may better split the expression into two distinct names,
the Śakas and Muruṇḍas.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.)
must be the Śakas of Western India belonging to the {%Satrapal%}
family of Caṣṭana and Rudradāman. In this period the Śaka
ruler was Rudrasiṃha II and his successor Rudrasiṃha III,
whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta
II.<sup>478</sup> Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and
about Sāñcī.<sup>479</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Scyths, whom Indians named as Śakas, were originally
living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called
Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that
place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the
Śakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of
Iran, and then the Greeks in India.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only
a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the Śakas
reached Mathurā. The Śakas continued the earlier practice
of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit.
The earliest Śaka king in India was Maues (about C. 80
B.C.)<sup>481</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sātavāhanas
were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invad-
ing Śakas of the Kṣaharāta clan; but the Śatavāhanas under
the greatest of their rulers, Gautamīputra Śātakarṇin recover-
ed their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more
is heard of the Kṣaharātas.<sup>482</sup>
<div n="P"/>Another Śaka dynasty, called the Kārddamaka family but
generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of
Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled
roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the height of their power govern-
ing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of
this dynasty was Rudradāman, who has left the earliest impor-
tant inscription in correct Sanskrit,<sup>483</sup> a long panegyric which
records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great
artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excava-
ted under Candragupta and improved in the time of Aśoka.
This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records
[Page-163+ 39]
of ancient India, and proves that Rudradāman was reigning in
A.D. 150.<sup>484</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the
West, where the Śakas had ruled for over 200 years and which
was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The Śakas at
that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power
to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription
claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the Śaka
lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with
them’.<sup>485</sup> It is clear that the Śaka homage to Samudragupta
was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered
to his successor,<sup>486</sup> and Candragupta II had to conquer the
Śakas once again.
<div n="P"/>There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudra-
gupta the Śakas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and
forced the weak king, Rāmagupta, to conclude a dishonour-
able peace.<sup>487</sup> Most authorities reject the story, and deny the
historicity of Rāmagupta, but the recent discovery of copper
coins bearing his name<sup>488</sup> strengthens the suggestion that
the tradition has a basis of fact.<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudra-
gupta and younger brother of the shadowy Rāmagupta, who
finally defeated the Śakas, soon after A.D. 388<sup>490</sup> So he is
rightly remembered as {%‘Śakāri’%} ‘the enemy of the Śakas’.<sup>491</sup>
<div n="P"/>The trousers were introduced into India by the Śakas and
seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during
the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins
as wearing trousers.<sup>492</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus
defeated the Śakas, when they were maddened by wine.<sup>493</sup>
It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of
the influence of the Śakas, the vogue for excessive drinking
spread. Strabo<sup>494</sup> speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the
Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style
passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.<sup>495</sup> We
know of similar drinking bouts in the Mahābhārata.<sup>496</sup> Prob-
ably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in
the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to
pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink-
[Page-164+ 39]
ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under Śaka and Persian
influence. Baudhāyana in his Dharmasūtra, Karṇa in the
Mahābhārata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced
drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.<sup>497</sup> But all
this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudhāyana belong to a
period before the coming of the Śakas. Āryans have been
great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for
the drinking before Śakas.
<div n="P"/>We may here refer to the Śaka Era (A.D. 78), which is
very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is
known to have been founded by a Śaka king who occupied
Ujjayinī 137 years after Vikramāditya. The era may in fact
have been founded by Kaniṣka. It was certainly used early in
the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled
Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era
spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East
Asia.<sup>498</sup> Because of its long association with the Śaka Satraps
the era may have earned its present name.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came to be included in the category of the mart-
ial classes of ancient India. Manu<sup>499</sup> refers to the warlike
people on the fringes of Āryan civilization, including the
Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (Śaka), and the Parthians (Pah-
lava), as kṣatriyas who had fallen from grace through their
neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more
into Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and
performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.<sup>500</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in
the legends which relate the contests between Vasiṣṭha and
Viśvāmitra, the Śakas are fabled to have been produced by
the cow of Vasiṣṭha, from her sweat, for the destruction of
Viśvāmitra's army.<sup>501</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>502</sup> traces the Śaka invasion on the basis
of literary and linguistic considerations.
<div n="P"/>The name of the capital of the {%Madras,%} Śākala, and that of
the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, Śākaladvīpa, are
based on the word Śaka and are indicative of a Śaka invasion.
Likewise, the name of the clan Śākya, to which Buddha
belonged, enshrines a reminiscence of the word Śaka.
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the place-names ending in {%kanthā%} existing in the
[Page-165+ 39]
whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala
region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the Śakas long
before the time of Pāṇini,<sup>503</sup> who is known to have flourished
one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great.
{%Kanthā%} is a Śaka word for city<sup>504</sup> and is akin to kadhāvara or
kanthāvara of Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions, {%Kand%} of Persian, {%Kanthā%}
of Khotanese, {%Kandh%} of Sogdian, {%Kandai%} of Pushto, {%Kanda%}
or {%Koent%} of the dialect of the Ṛṣikas. It is significant
that the land beyond the Oxus, the {%Urheimat%} of the Śakas,
abounds in {%Kanthā%}-ending place names, such as Samarkand,
Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand.
<div n="P"/>The reference to the stepped-well, called {%Śakandhu%} after
the Śakas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known
as {%Karkandhu%} after the Karkians, in a vārttika of Katyāyana<sup>505</sup>
also leads to the same conclusion.
<div n="P"/>At the time of Alexander's invasion the Śakas lived at the
north-western borders of India. That this tide of Śaka inva-
sion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern
extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the
Purāṇas that the Śakas advanced to Ayodhyā during the reign
of King Bāhu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled
them.<sup>506</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata the Śakas are stated to have constitut-
ed along with Cūlikas, Tuṣāras and Yavanas, the right wing
of the Krauñcavyūha formed by Bhīṣma on the sixth day of
the battle. <sup>507</sup> Caraka in his medical treatise<sup>508</sup> refers to them
in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Bāhlika, Pahlava,
Cīna, Yavana and Śaka.<sup>509</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the
Śakas in modern times.<sup>510</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the
Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal
to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian
people.<sup>511</sup> The depth of their influence on Indian society is
manifest from the word {%thakura,%} which implies the ideas of
nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab
and is derived from the word {%thagora, taugara%} or {%tukhara.%}<sup>512</sup>
The name {%Tukhāra%} itself survives in the name of the {%Tokhi%}
caste found in the North-West.<sup>513</sup> Another caste called Khosla
[Page-166+ 39]
is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Kṣaharāta
chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous
to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kuṣāṇa
emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated
this word with Turki {%güjlü%} meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow
has compared it with Turki {%guzel,%} meaning ‘beautiful’, but
Lüders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of
the Śakas.<sup>514</sup> So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this
tribe.<sup>515</sup> Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab,
there are caste-groups of {%Soi%} and {%Sikka,%} which are reminiscent
of the Śakas.
