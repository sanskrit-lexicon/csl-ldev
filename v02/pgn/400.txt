10. {%Kakubha%}¦ (No. 15, L. 5):
Inscription No. 15 informs us that five stone images of Ādikar-
tṛis or Tīrthaṃkaras were set up by Madra at the village of
Kakubha. The village was sanctified by its association with
holy men.<sup>424</sup> It was also known as Kakubhagrāma,<sup>425</sup> the
[Page-243+ 39]
suffix grāma seems to have been dropped in the present case.
Kakubha is identified with modern Kahāum or Kahawan, a
village about five miles to the west by south of Salampur-
Majhauli, the chief town of the Salampur-Majhauli Pargaṇā in
the Deoria, Deoriyā or Dewariyā Tehsil or sub-division of the
Gorakhpur district in Uttar Pradesh. The grey sandstone
column on which the inscription is engraved stands at a short
distance on the east of the village.<sup>426</sup>
