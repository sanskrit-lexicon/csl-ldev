<div n="P"/>‘Patha’ in Zend. The sanskrit spelling ({%th%}) is loaned from
Iran. Greek relatives are patos (path) and pontos (mariners'
path, sea-route: sea). Initial {%p%} is dropped in old Irish:
pathin (path) and pons (bridge) recur as {%ath%} (ford)’. Russian
pant (path) and pent (ford).<sup>191</sup>

<div n="P"/>Monier Williams derives it from §panth to go, to move.
It means a way, path, a road or route.<sup>192</sup> In the Samarāṅga-
ṇasūtradhāra<sup>193</sup> we find the word ‘Jaṅghā-patha (foot-path)’.
The suffix ‘patha’ has been used as early as the later Vedic
period.<sup>194</sup> Originally patha meant ‘a path’, ‘a road’ but later on
it came to denote ‘a country’. Even now-a-days, the suffix
‘road’ is used for inhabitations and localities.
