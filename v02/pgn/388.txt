2. {%Mahākāntāra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
It is one of the southern countries subdued by Samudragupta.
Its ruler was Vyāghararāja. Literally Mahākāntāra means ‘a
great forest’. It has to be distinguished from Sarvāṭavi referred
to later on in this inscription.<sup>378</sup> According to Krishnaswami
Aiyangar,<sup>379</sup> it must have included the Saugar division of C.P.
extending northwards to the Ajaigadh State in Bundelkhanda.
But G. Ramdas differs from this view on the ground that Mahā-
kāntāra must be sought in Southern India as it is specifically
mentioned as one of the kingdoms of the South conquered
by Samudragupta. He suggests that Mahākāntāra must be the
same as Mahāvana, a forest region extending northwards into
[Page-239+ 37]
Ganjam Agency and westwards into the tract formerly
known as the Chatisgarh States of C.P.<sup>380</sup> This very region has
been mentioned by the same name in the Ganj and Nachna
inscriptions.<sup>381</sup>
