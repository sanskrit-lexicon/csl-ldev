2. {%Mahākāntāra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>It is one of the southern countries subdued by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>Its ruler was Vyāghararāja. Literally Mahākāntāra means ‘a
<div n="lb"/>great forest’. It has to be distinguished from Sarvāṭavi referred
<div n="lb"/>to later on in this inscription.<sup>378</sup> According to Krishnaswami
<div n="lb"/>Aiyangar,<sup>379</sup> it must have included the Saugar division of C.P.
<div n="lb"/>extending northwards to the Ajaigadh State in Bundelkhanda.
<div n="lb"/>But G. Ramdas differs from this view on the ground that Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>kāntāra must be sought in Southern India as it is specifically
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as one of the kingdoms of the South conquered
<div n="lb"/>by Samudragupta. He suggests that Mahākāntāra must be the
<div n="lb"/>same as Mahāvana, a forest region extending northwards into
[Page-239+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>Ganjam Agency and westwards into the tract formerly
<div n="lb"/>known as the Chatisgarh States of C.P.<sup>380</sup> This very region has
<div n="lb"/>been mentioned by the same name in the Ganj and Nachna
<div n="lb"/>inscriptions.<sup>381</sup>
