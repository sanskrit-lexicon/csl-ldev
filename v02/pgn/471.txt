4. {%Kālindī%}¦ (No. 18 L. 3):
According to the inscription in the reign of Budhagupta, his
feudatory, Mahārāja Suraśmicandra was governing the country
lying between the river Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>18</sup> Kālindī is
the same as the river Yamunā.<sup>19</sup> The Yamunā has got its
source from the Kalindadeśa, a mountainous country situated
in the Bāndarapuccha range or the Himālaya and hence the
river is called Kālindī.<sup>20</sup> In the Purāṇas we get the earlier
mention of Kālindī by both the names, Kālindī as well as
Yamunā.<sup>21</sup> The Kālindī is also mentioned in the Śiśupālavadha
of Māga.<sup>22</sup>
