4. {%Kālindī%}¦ (No. 18 L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>According to the inscription in the reign of Budhagupta, his
<div n="lb"/>feudatory, Mahārāja Suraśmicandra was governing the country
<div n="lb"/>lying between the river Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>18</sup> Kālindī is
<div n="lb"/>the same as the river Yamunā.<sup>19</sup> The Yamunā has got its
<div n="lb"/>source from the Kalindadeśa, a mountainous country situated
<div n="lb"/>in the Bāndarapuccha range or the Himālaya and hence the
<div n="lb"/>river is called Kālindī.<sup>20</sup> In the Purāṇas we get the earlier
<div n="lb"/>mention of Kālindī by both the names, Kālindī as well as
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā.<sup>21</sup> The Kālindī is also mentioned in the Śiśupālavadha
<div n="lb"/>of Māga.<sup>22</sup>
