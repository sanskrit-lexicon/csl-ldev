(4) {%Indrapura%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8):
<div n="lb"/>The inscription states that an endowment was given by a brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa named Devaviṣṇu for the maintenance of a lamp in a
<div n="lb"/>temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of
<div n="lb"/>Indrapura kṣatriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha
<div n="lb"/>at Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>In line 5 we get ‘Candrāpuraka-Padmā’ as the reading
<div n="lb"/>taken by Fleet<sup>251</sup> and he thus considers it a separate town than
<div n="lb"/>Indrapura.<sup>252</sup> But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendra-
<div n="lb"/>puraka-Padmā’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of
<div n="lb"/>‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2)
<div n="lb"/>though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply
<div n="lb"/>‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and
<div n="lb"/>Jagannath.<sup>253</sup> Thus we see that the Padmā referred in line 5
[Page-228+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>Now we find two different spellings of Indrāpura in lines 5
<div n="lb"/>and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.<sup>254</sup>
<div n="P"/>What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5
<div n="lb"/>and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a
<div n="lb"/>succinct purpose here. The vṛddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was
<div n="lb"/>desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.<sup>255</sup> So it is a weaker
<div n="lb"/>form of the affix ‘ka’, without vṛddhi of the vowel in the first
<div n="lb"/>syllable.<sup>256</sup> The writer seems to have used the long vowel
<div n="lb"/>(with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vṛddhi in the first
<div n="lb"/>syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura.
<div n="lb"/>We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel
<div n="lb"/>in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use
<div n="lb"/>in Vedic literature.<sup>257</sup> So we shall translate ‘Indrāpuraka Pad-
<div n="lb"/>mā’ as ‘Padmā of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapuraka-
<div n="lb"/>vaṇigbhyām’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This
<div n="lb"/>Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,<sup>258</sup> near Dibhāi, Buland-
<div n="lb"/>shahr district, U.P.<sup>259</sup> The ancient town of Indrapura was
<div n="lb"/>situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the
<div n="lb"/>north-west of Dibhāi.<sup>260</sup> Now-a-days it is only a kheḍā or deser-
<div n="lb"/>ted mound, and is not shown in maps<sup>261</sup>
