<div n="lb"/>names ending in ‘ila’ we find Devila being derived from Deva-
<div n="lb"/>datta; Yajñila and Yajñadatta; Makhila from Makhadeva;
<div n="lb"/>Agila from Agnidatta; Satila from Svātidatta; Nāgila from
<div n="lb"/>Nāgadatta, and Yasila, Yakhila from Yakṣadatta.<sup>55</sup> Similarly
<div n="lb"/>Matila can be formed from Matideva or Matidatta.
