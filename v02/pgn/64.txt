7. {%Matila%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta.
According to Pāṇini,<sup>54</sup> a polysyllabic name was sometime
shortened in order to express affection. Thus in the case of
names ending in ‘ila’ we find Devila being derived from Deva-
datta; Yajñila and Yajñadatta; Makhila from Makhadeva;
Agila from Agnidatta; Satila from Svātidatta; Nāgila from
Nāgadatta, and Yasila, Yakhila from Yakṣadatta.<sup>55</sup> Similarly
Matila can be formed from Matideva or Matidatta.
