7. {%Kharaparikas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>One of the tribes who were subjugated by Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>154</sup> takes them to be the Kharparas
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Batihagadh Inscription<sup>155</sup> of the Damoh
<div n="lb"/>district of M.P. Kharpara<sup>156</sup> means a thief, a rogue or a cheat.
<div n="lb"/>The name Kharaparika does not occur elsewhere in inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tions or literature. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa<sup>157</sup> mentions
<div n="lb"/>a tribe called Khara-sāgara-rāśīs,<sup>158</sup> along with the Gand-
<div n="lb"/>haras and the Yaudheyas; and the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>159</sup> refers
<div n="lb"/>to a country named Kharapatha, watered by the river Nalinī.
<div n="lb"/>It is difficult to say whether Khara-sāgara-rāśī and Kharapatha
[Page-136+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>had anything to do with the Kharaparikas.<sup>160</sup> K.P. Jayaswal
<div n="lb"/>expresses the probability of the identification of the Kharapa-
<div n="lb"/>rikas with the five Karpaṭas of the Mahābhārata.<sup>161</sup>
