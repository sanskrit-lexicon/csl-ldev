23. {%Yaudheya%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied north-
<div n="lb"/>ern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory
<div n="lb"/>extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where
<div n="lb"/>their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.<sup>581</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the
<div n="lb"/>Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)<sup>582</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over
<div n="lb"/>the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijaya-
<div n="lb"/>gadh Inscription<sup>583</sup> which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)<sup>584</sup> connects
<div n="lb"/>them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one
<div n="lb"/>Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.<sup>585</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally the word {%Yaudheya%} means ‘a warrior’ which corr-
<div n="lb"/>esponds with the {%Ossadü%} of Arrian, the {%Sambastae%} of Diodorus
<div n="lb"/>and the {%Sambracae%} of Curtius, who made their submission to
<div n="lb"/>Alexander.<sup>586</sup> They were a powerful nation and their forces
<div n="lb"/>consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.<sup>587</sup>
<div n="P"/>We get three different versions about the origin of the
<div n="lb"/>Yaudheyas:
<div n="HI"/>(i) In the Mahābhārata<sup>588</sup> it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana
<div n="lb"/>named Devikā and begot a son from her named
<div n="lb"/>Yaudheya.
<div n="lb"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>589</sup> and M.K. Sharan,<sup>590</sup> on this basis,
<div n="lb"/>have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K.
<div n="lb"/>Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this
<div n="lb"/>solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a posi-
<div n="lb"/>tive evidence;<sup>591</sup> but on the other hand he himself has
<div n="lb"/>indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic
<div n="lb"/>hero Arjuna.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same
<div n="lb"/>story. It states that {%Yaudheyī%} was the queen of Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka<sup>593</sup>
[Page-172+ 39]
<div n="HI"/>(iii) The Harivaṃśa<sup>594</sup> and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>595</sup> state that
<div n="lb"/>King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens
<div n="lb"/>named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣad-
<div n="lb"/>vatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga),
<div n="lb"/>Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively.
<div n="lb"/>Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of
<div n="lb"/>Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the
<div n="lb"/>Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons
<div n="lb"/>of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the
<div n="lb"/>lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Amba-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhapurī.<sup>596</sup> According to Pargiter, King Uśinara
<div n="lb"/>established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and
<div n="lb"/>the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the
<div n="lb"/>Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated
<div n="lb"/>the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.<sup>597</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition
<div n="lb"/>without any further evidence. However, as regards their conne-
<div n="lb"/>ction with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat
<div n="lb"/>confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the
<div n="lb"/>territory ruled over by him.<sup>598</sup> The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as
<div n="lb"/>well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the
<div n="lb"/>Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley,
<div n="lb"/>a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsa-
<div n="lb"/>ritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near
<div n="lb"/>the source of Ganges at Kanakhala.
<div n="P"/>It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat
<div n="lb"/>Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places
<div n="lb"/>as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to
<div n="lb"/>Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the
<div n="lb"/>Akesines (Chenab).<sup>599</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata,<sup>600</sup> the Yaudheyas are described as
<div n="lb"/>having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and
<div n="lb"/>Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,<sup>601</sup> the Yaudheyas together
<div n="lb"/>with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having
<div n="lb"/>paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,<sup>602</sup> we find
<div n="lb"/>that an epithet {%‘Adrija’%} meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for
<div n="lb"/>the Yaudheyas.
<div n="P"/>The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the
[Page-173+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Punjab. Pāṇini<sup>603</sup> includes them among the {%āyudhajīvī saṃghas%}
<div n="lb"/>together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians
<div n="lb"/>by Dr. Buddha Prakash.<sup>604</sup> Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in
<div n="lb"/>another Sūtra also.<sup>605</sup> Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as
<div n="lb"/>a warrior clan of the Punjab.<sup>606</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>607</sup> places them in the northern division of
<div n="lb"/>India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.<sup>608</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as
<div n="lb"/>interested in gambling ({%dīvyatām%}) and speaking the Southern
<div n="lb"/>Vaidarbhī.<sup>609</sup>
<div n="P"/>Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from
<div n="lb"/>Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been
<div n="lb"/>unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds
<div n="lb"/>was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak
<div n="lb"/>where there seems to have existed a regular mint.<sup>610</sup> Their
<div n="lb"/>new currency<sup>611</sup> depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which
<div n="lb"/>replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that
<div n="lb"/>they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule
<div n="lb"/>in India.<sup>612</sup> The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large num-
<div n="lb"/>ber at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra
<div n="lb"/>attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these
<div n="lb"/>areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D.<sup>613</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of their seals, bearing the legend {%“Yaudheyānām jayam-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%antradharāṇām”%}<sup>614</sup> shows that they were held in high esteem
<div n="lb"/>among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem
<div n="lb"/>to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji<sup>615</sup>
<div n="lb"/>opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as
<div n="lb"/>well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan<sup>616</sup> explains the word
<div n="lb"/>{%“Mantradhara”%} to mean the members of the Executive Com-
<div n="lb"/>mittee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the
<div n="lb"/>opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the
<div n="lb"/>name of the {%“Mantradharas”%} and the {%“Gaṇa”,%} while the other
<div n="lb"/>set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.<sup>617</sup> He seems to have
<div n="lb"/>wrongly substituted the reading {%“Mantradhāra”%} for {%“Mantra-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%dhara”.%} He has been arbitrary in separating {%“Jaya”%} from
<div n="lb"/>{%Mantradharāṇām%}”<sup>618</sup> which forms a compound by the combi-
<div n="lb"/>nation of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some
<div n="lb"/>historians who consider the word {%“Mantradharāṇām”%} to mean
[Page-174+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he
<div n="lb"/>contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal<sup>619</sup>
<div n="lb"/>found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates
<div n="lb"/>the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as
<div n="lb"/>they had adopted the title of {#‘जयमन्त्रधराः’#}”.
<div n="P"/>Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who
<div n="lb"/>knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and
<div n="lb"/>pride that they never got defeated.
<div n="P"/>Another word which has raised some controversy among
<div n="lb"/>the scholars is {%“Darma”%} found on some of the Yaudheya coins.
<div n="lb"/>Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for
<div n="lb"/>{%‘Dama’%} or {%‘Darma’%} to be a Sanskritised form of Greek —
<div n="lb"/>{%“Drachma”.%}<sup>620</sup> Again some controversy arose whether it was
<div n="lb"/>a Copper one or of silver.<sup>621</sup> The word {%‘Damma’%} or {%‘Dramma’%}
<div n="lb"/>has been used for a gold coin.<sup>622</sup> It may be remarked that the
<div n="lb"/>word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly
<div n="lb"/>be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean
<div n="lb"/>coin.<sup>623</sup> The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were
<div n="lb"/>later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to
<div n="lb"/>have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found
<div n="lb"/>no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker
<div n="lb"/>economic condition; surely they could not compare with
<div n="lb"/>powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have
<div n="lb"/>the mysterious words, {%“dvi”%} (two) and {%“tri”%} (three) after the
<div n="lb"/>legend {%“Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ”%} which may point out their
<div n="lb"/>making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kuṇindas.<sup>624</sup> They seem to have controlled the area
<div n="lb"/>lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the
<div n="lb"/>Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word
<div n="lb"/>{%‘Johiya’%} is apparently an abbreviation of {%‘Jodhiya’,%} which is the
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit Yaudheya.<sup>625</sup> Cunningham, however, takes the words
<div n="lb"/>{%‘dvi’%} and {%‘tri’%} of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the
<div n="lb"/>money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.<sup>626</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.K. Sharan<sup>627</sup> has enlisted about twenty-four types and
<div n="lb"/>Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to
<div n="lb"/>their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their
<div n="lb"/>social life. They are as follows:
<div n="P"/>1. Bull
<div n="P"/>2. Elephant
[Page-175+ 24]
<div n="P"/>3. Deer
<div n="P"/>4. Peacock
<div n="P"/>5. Tree-in-railing
<div n="P"/>6. Human figure standing (warrior)
<div n="P"/>7. Lakṣmī
<div n="P"/>8. Cobra
<div n="P"/>9. Scythic-like object (Yūpa)
<div n="P"/>10. Stūpa
<div n="P"/>11. Triśūla
<div n="P"/>12. Nandipada
<div n="P"/>13. Shell
<div n="P"/>14. Svastika
<div n="P"/>15. Vase or Maṅgala Kalaśa
<div n="P"/>16. Tribal sign or Ujjayinī Symbol
<div n="HI"/>17. Two {%‘s’%} with a line in between probably representing
<div n="lb"/>two hooded snakes
<div n="P"/>18. Triangular-headed symbol or more probably a Yūpa
<div n="P"/>19. Zig-Zag line depicting snake or river
<div n="P"/>20. Circles with dots around, probably representing the sun
<div n="HI"/>21. Curved object within railing, probably a representation
<div n="lb"/>of the Yūpa
<div n="P"/>22. Hill so-called Caitya
<div n="P"/>23. Six-headed Ṣaṣṭhī or Kṛttikā<sup>628</sup>
<div n="P"/>24. Śiva.
