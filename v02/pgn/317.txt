4. {%Daivaputra%}¦<sup>87</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>Daivaputras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍas are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta by rendering to him all kinds of service.
<div n="P"/>The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to
<div n="lb"/>{%devaputra%}’, i. e., Kaniṣka, i. e., the Kuṣāṇa ruler. The title
<div n="lb"/>devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa
<div n="lb"/>kings.<sup>88</sup>
<div n="P"/>The common belief is that the designation {%devaputra%} ‘god-
<div n="lb"/>son’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese
<div n="lb"/>imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.<sup>89</sup> Thomas considers
<div n="lb"/>that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed
<div n="lb"/>from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly
<div n="lb"/>from the Chinese.<sup>90</sup> Narain also believes the title to have been
<div n="lb"/>borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.<sup>91</sup> The title has
<div n="lb"/>been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents
<div n="lb"/>discovered from Chinese Turkestan.<sup>92</sup> As regards the origin of
<div n="lb"/>the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in
<div n="lb"/>many ancient empires.<sup>93</sup> The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva-
[Page-130+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>putra’<sup>94</sup> meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used
<div n="lb"/>for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished
<div n="lb"/>divinities, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used
<div n="lb"/>for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters,
<div n="lb"/>East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In
<div n="lb"/>the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the
<div n="lb"/>sense of Royal insignia.<sup>95</sup> In a Buddhist text of this period the
<div n="lb"/>question is raised ‘why kings are called {%devaputra%}’ and the
<div n="lb"/>answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding
<div n="lb"/>among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods
<div n="lb"/>(each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no
<div n="lb"/>other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’.
<div n="lb"/>Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do
<div n="lb"/>not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as
<div n="lb"/>{%deva.%} The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt {%devaputra%} as an official title
<div n="lb"/>in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading
<div n="lb"/>on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which
<div n="lb"/>has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in
<div n="lb"/>consultation with Allan.<sup>97</sup> Kaniṣka has not used the title even
<div n="lb"/>in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved.
<div n="lb"/>It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title
<div n="lb"/>{%‘devaputra’%} is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.<sup>98</sup> The title is used for
<div n="lb"/>the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).<sup>99</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra%} Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver
<div n="lb"/>Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="lb"/>As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll
<div n="lb"/>inscription is the first known instance of the application to
<div n="lb"/>the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly,
<div n="lb"/>though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his succes-
<div n="lb"/>sors.”<sup>101</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by
<div n="lb"/>the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the
<div n="lb"/>Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were
<div n="lb"/>designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas
<div n="lb"/>suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior
<div n="lb"/>title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel-
[Page-131+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity
<div n="lb"/>between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as
<div n="lb"/>regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra
<div n="lb"/>in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means
<div n="lb"/>god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as
<div n="lb"/>‘guardian of the northern heaven’.<sup>102</sup> It is also likely that
<div n="lb"/>the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara,
<div n="lb"/>whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole
<div n="lb"/>deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.<sup>103</sup> These facts
<div n="lb"/>need further investigation.
<div n="P"/>Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of
<div n="lb"/>Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity
<div n="lb"/>and not as a title.<sup>104</sup> Aśoka could claim the title only of
<div n="lb"/>{%‘Devānām priya’%}<sup>105</sup> meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus
<div n="lb"/>{%Devaputra%} or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas
<div n="lb"/>by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet {%Devaputravat%}
<div n="lb"/>has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions<sup>106</sup>
