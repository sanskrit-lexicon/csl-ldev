4. {%Ūrjayat%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudarśana looked
like the sea<sup>101</sup> and the rivers Palāśinī, (Suvarṇasikatā), etc.,
had joined it has if the mountain Ūrjayat had stretched his
hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus
falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy
husband.<sup>102</sup> Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain
Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse
28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym
of its name viz., the Ūrjayat and while making it the symbol
of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.<sup>103</sup>
Thus the mountains Ūrjayat and the Raivataka are one and
the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the
fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradā-
man describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsi-
katā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat<sup>104</sup> in Inscription No. 14
the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.<sup>105</sup> Fleet<sup>106</sup>
and Sircar<sup>107</sup> are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill diff-
erent from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The
[Page-300+ 40]
Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the
Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sancti-
fied by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathia-
wad).<sup>108</sup> In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century)
verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names
Ujjayanata and Raivata.<sup>109</sup> The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of
Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as
synonyms.<sup>110</sup> The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka
also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).<sup>111</sup> The mountain Ūrjayat
is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.<sup>112</sup> The literal
meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.<sup>113</sup>
