4. {%Ūrjayat%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudarśana looked
<div n="lb"/>like the sea<sup>101</sup> and the rivers Palāśinī, (Suvarṇasikatā), etc.,
<div n="lb"/>had joined it has if the mountain Ūrjayat had stretched his
<div n="lb"/>hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus
<div n="lb"/>falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy
<div n="lb"/>husband.<sup>102</sup> Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain
<div n="lb"/>Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse
<div n="lb"/>28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym
<div n="lb"/>of its name viz., the Ūrjayat and while making it the symbol
<div n="lb"/>of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.<sup>103</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Thus the mountains Ūrjayat and the Raivataka are one and
<div n="lb"/>the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the
<div n="lb"/>fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradā-
<div n="lb"/>man describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsi-
<div n="lb"/>katā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat<sup>104</sup> in Inscription No. 14
<div n="lb"/>the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.<sup>105</sup> Fleet<sup>106</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Sircar<sup>107</sup> are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill diff-
<div n="lb"/>erent from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The
[Page-300+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sancti-
<div n="lb"/>fied by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathia-
<div n="lb"/>wad).<sup>108</sup> In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century)
<div n="lb"/>verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayanata and Raivata.<sup>109</sup> The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of
<div n="lb"/>Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as
<div n="lb"/>synonyms.<sup>110</sup> The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka
<div n="lb"/>also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).<sup>111</sup> The mountain Ūrjayat
<div n="lb"/>is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.<sup>112</sup> The literal
<div n="lb"/>meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.<sup>113</sup>
