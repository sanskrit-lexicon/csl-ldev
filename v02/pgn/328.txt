15. {%Prārjūnas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>A tribe subdued by Samudragupta who are said to have obeyed

<div n="lb"/>Smith<sup>392</sup> places the Prārjūnas in the Narasiṃhapur district of
[Page-155+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the Central Provinces, but a more plausible location is Nara-
<div n="lb"/>siṃhagarh in Central India,<sup>393</sup> as much as three other tribes
<div n="lb"/>which are coupled with Prārjūnas, the Sanakānīkas, Kākas and
<div n="lb"/>Kharaparikas, seem to have occupied regions more or less
<div n="lb"/>within the bounds of Central India<sup>394</sup> The tribe, associated
<div n="lb"/>with the name of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and north-west
<div n="lb"/>before the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.<sup>395</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Kauṭilya knows of a people called {%Prājjunaka (Prārjunaka).%}<sup>396</sup>
