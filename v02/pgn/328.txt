15. {%Prārjūnas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
A tribe subdued by Samudragupta who are said to have obeyed
his imperial commands and paid all kinds of taxes. Vincent
Smith<sup>392</sup> places the Prārjūnas in the Narasiṃhapur district of
[Page-155+ 39]
the Central Provinces, but a more plausible location is Nara-
siṃhagarh in Central India,<sup>393</sup> as much as three other tribes
which are coupled with Prārjūnas, the Sanakānīkas, Kākas and
Kharaparikas, seem to have occupied regions more or less
within the bounds of Central India<sup>394</sup> The tribe, associated
with the name of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and north-west
before the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.<sup>395</sup>
Kauṭilya knows of a people called {%Prājjunaka (Prārjunaka).%}<sup>396</sup>
