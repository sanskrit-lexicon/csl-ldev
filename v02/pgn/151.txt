12. {%Somapāla%}¦ (No. 29, L. 6):
Soma is nectar (the beverage of the gods called {%Amṛta%}) and
{%pāla%} means ‘protector’. Thus the whole literally means ‘pro-
tector or guardian of Amṛta’. It is the name of several men in
the Rājataraṅgiṇī<sup>64</sup> and in plural it is the name of the Gan-
dharvas (as keeping especial guard over Soma).<sup>65</sup>
