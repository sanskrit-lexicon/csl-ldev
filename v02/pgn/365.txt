 {%Pur or Pura%}¦
<div n="lb"/>Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the Ṛgveda.<sup>209</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>early Vedic Āryans were not city builders. Puras<sup>210</sup> which are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned from the context seem to have been always associ-
<div n="lb"/>ated with the dasyus and the enemies of the Āryans.<sup>211</sup> Pura,
<div n="lb"/>the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from
<div n="lb"/>the Dravidian {%ur.%} From what we read in the Ṛgveda about
<div n="lb"/>Puraṃdara's exploits in connection with the destruction of
<div n="lb"/>the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing
<div n="lb"/>havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of
<div n="lb"/>the Indus Valley pre-Āryans.<sup>212</sup> But the word {%ur%} is not availa-
<div n="lb"/>ble in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned by them.<sup>213</sup> The word {%ur%} is not to be traced in the
<div n="lb"/>I. E. languages.<sup>214</sup> We find {%Ur%} only as the name of a town in
<div n="lb"/>Babylonia.<sup>215</sup> In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the
<div n="lb"/>Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word {%‘ur’%} is used to
<div n="lb"/>refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of
<div n="lb"/>ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabhā is
<div n="lb"/>used in case of Agrahāra villages, mostly tenanted by learned
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇas.<sup>216</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later Vedic literature<sup>217</sup> the word Pur meant ‘rampart’,
<div n="lb"/>‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed
<div n="lb"/>later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature.
<div n="P"/>Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings
<div n="lb"/>surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kośa in
<div n="lb"/>length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a kheṭa;
<div n="lb"/>if less than that, a karvaṭa or small market town, any smaller
<div n="lb"/>cluster of houses is called a grāma or village.<sup>218</sup> The Sama-
[Page-225+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>rāṅgaṇasūtradhāra describes puras as being of three kinds —
<div n="lb"/>Big, middle and small which have different measurements for
<div n="lb"/>their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.<sup>219</sup> The big one
<div n="lb"/>possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of
<div n="lb"/>two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.<sup>220</sup>
<div n="lb"/>T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’:
<div n="lb"/>Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).<sup>221</sup> We find the word being spelt
<div n="lb"/>in two ways pur<sup>222</sup> and pura<sup>223</sup> Pur (city), from puru (much)
<div n="lb"/>and pūrṇa (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers.
<div n="lb"/>Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus
<div n="lb"/>(population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from
<div n="lb"/>full. Pur is the city and puruṣa the citizen. Greek polites
<div n="lb"/>(citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city
<div n="lb"/>administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world):
<div n="lb"/>Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).<sup>224</sup> In modern times the word
<div n="lb"/>purā (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be
<div n="lb"/>the result of Muslim contact.<sup>225</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pura, where it does not retain the original from pur, is
<div n="lb"/>changed into the following<sup>226</sup>:
<div n="HI"/>(a) Wār: as Purushapura, Peshawar; Nalapura, Narwar;
<div n="lb"/>Matipura, Madwār; Śalwapura, Alwar; Candrapura,
<div n="lb"/>Candwar.
<div n="P"/>(b) Urs or ur, as Māyāpura, Mayura; Siṃhapura, Siṅgur;
<div n="lb"/>Juṣkapura, Zukur
<div n="P"/>(c) Or, as Traipura, Tcor; Candrādityapura, Caindor
<div n="P"/>(d) Ora, as Ilbalapura, Ellora
<div n="P"/>(e) Ore, as Lavapura, Lahore
<div n="P"/>(f) Ola, as Āryapura, Aihole
<div n="P"/>(g) ar, as Kusumapura, Kumrār
<div n="P"/>(h) aur, as Siddhapura, Siddhaur
<div n="P"/>(i) Own, as Hiraṇyapura, Hindoun or Herdoun
<div n="P"/>There are many names with the suffix Pura in the Aṣṭā-
<div n="lb"/>dhyāyī, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and the Kāśikā.<sup>227</sup> The word
<div n="lb"/>Mahāpura in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>228</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>229</sup>
<div n="lb"/>denotes a great fortress. Probably the only difference between
<div n="lb"/>the Pur and Mahāpura was in their size.<sup>230</sup>
<div n="P"/>Following are the place-names ending in the suffix pura:
