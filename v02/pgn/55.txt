3. {%Bhīmavarman%}¦ (No. 26, L. 1):
He is mentioned as a {%mahārāja%} and seems to have been a
feudatory king of Skandagupta. Bhīma was the name of one
of the five Pāṇḍavas (the second son of Pāṇḍu) mentioned in
the Mahābhārata. Literally the name may mean ‘one who pro-
tects by awfulness’. Bhīma is also the name of Rudra-Śiva, one
of the eight forms of Śiva.<sup>43</sup> Thus it may be a name based on
god Śiva.
