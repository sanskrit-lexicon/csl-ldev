 {%Eraṇḍapalla%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
It is mentioned in the list of countries of Southern region
conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Damana. Fleet
identifies Eraṇḍapalla with Erandol in the E. Khandesh
district of the Bombay Presidency.<sup>450</sup> K.N. Dikshit and Y.R.
Gupte agreed with this view.<sup>451</sup> But according to Dubreuil and
K.G. Sankar, it is the same as the town Erandpalli near
Chicacole on the Coast of Orissa.<sup>452</sup> G. Ramdas opposes
Fleet's identification on the ground that Eraṇḍapallī mentioned
immediately after the kingdom of Svāmidatta cannot be so far
away on the western coast, it must have been in the vicinity
of Kaliṅga and Piṣṭapura kingdom.<sup>453</sup> Eraṇḍapallī is mentioned
in the Siddhantam plates of Devendravarman of Kaliṅga.<sup>454</sup>
Banerjee counts Damana of Eraṇḍapalla among the three
chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta
through their country.<sup>455</sup>
<div n="P"/>G. Ramdas<sup>456</sup> regards Dubreuil's identification also to
be incorrect because Chicacole lies in Kaliṅga which was clearly
the country ruled by Svāmidatta. Eraṇḍapallī will have, there-
fore, to be identified with the village Yendipalli in the Golgonda
[Page-246+ 37]
Taluka of the Vizagapatam district or with the village Eṇḍapalli
in Elore Tāluka.<sup>457</sup> But if we suppose that Svāmidatta was
the king of Koṭṭūra alone and not of the whole of Kaliṅga,
Eraṇḍapallī may well be identified with Chicacole.<sup>458</sup>
<div n="P"/>Palla is the corrupt form of Pallī which means an inhabitation
and Eraṇḍa is the castor-oil-plant<sup>459</sup> It seems that the region
abounded in eraṇḍa plants.
