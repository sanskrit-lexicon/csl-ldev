9. {%Rāma%}¦ (No. 29, L. 6):
<div n="lb"/>It is another one-word name. Here the name of Lord Rāma,
<div n="lb"/>the Epic hero, has been given directly to a person against the
<div n="lb"/>rules of the Smṛtis. We may suggest that in such cases either the
<div n="lb"/>second part is dropped or is not given at all by the parents.
