2. {%Ārjunāyanas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>The name Ārjuneya is mentioned in the Ṛgveda as the
<div n="lb"/>patronymic of Kautsa.<sup>56</sup> The tribe, associated with the name
<div n="lb"/>of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to
<div n="lb"/>the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.<sup>57</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>word Arjuna in the Vedic literature<sup>58</sup> denotes ‘white’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not
<div n="lb"/>denote a tribe or a human hero.
<div n="P"/>The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with
<div n="lb"/>the Śaka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is
<div n="lb"/>derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the Śaka words {%aljsā,%}
<div n="lb"/>meaning ‘silvery’ and {%āljsata,%} meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to
<div n="lb"/>the Avestan word {%erezata%} (silver), the Sanskrit word {%rajata%}
<div n="lb"/>(silver) and the Persian word {%arziz%} (tin).<sup>59</sup> All these words have
<div n="lb"/>the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also
<div n="lb"/>connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant
<div n="lb"/>that Arjuna, the hero of the Mahābhārata, is said to have borne
<div n="lb"/>this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.<sup>60</sup> All
<div n="lb"/>over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’
<div n="lb"/>and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word
<div n="lb"/>for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership.
<div n="lb"/>This is why {%erzuna%} was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in Śaka
<div n="lb"/>languages.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic and Śaka both branched from the same parent Indo-
<div n="lb"/>European language. Hence many words were common to both.
<div n="lb"/>But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was
<div n="lb"/>only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in Śaka it
<div n="lb"/>meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was
<div n="lb"/>imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="P"/>The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected
<div n="lb"/>with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and
<div n="lb"/>kings had this designation.<sup>63</sup> In the Uighur redaction of the
[Page-128+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Hiḍimbāvadha<sup>64</sup> the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of
<div n="lb"/>Arcuni.<sup>65</sup> According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world
<div n="lb"/>to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded
<div n="lb"/>as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central
<div n="lb"/>Asiatic oases-states.<sup>66</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini<sup>67</sup> refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka,
<div n="lb"/>together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Vāsudevaka.
<div n="lb"/>This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the
<div n="lb"/>time of Pāṇini and his followers occupied a prominent posi-
<div n="lb"/>tion. <sup>68</sup> The Kāśikā replaces Auddālakāyana of Patañjali by
<div n="lb"/>Ārjunāyana,<sup>69</sup> the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in
<div n="lb"/>discussing the meaning of Prācya-bhārata (II. 4. 66).
<div n="P"/>From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by
<div n="lb"/>Alexander we learn that a tribe named {%Agalassoi%} (Arjunāyana)
<div n="lb"/>fought with Alexander.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> places the Ārjunāyana in the northern
<div n="lb"/>division of India and describes them as being in the region of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls
<div n="lb"/>{%Pandoouoi%}<sup>73</sup> = Pāṇḍavas with whom the Ārjunāyanas may be
<div n="lb"/>connected.<sup>74</sup> Ārjunāyana coins are found in the Mathurā
<div n="lb"/>region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region
<div n="lb"/>lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking,
<div n="lb"/>to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.<sup>75</sup>
