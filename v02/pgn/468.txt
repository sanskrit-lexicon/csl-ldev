1. {%Gaṅgā%}¦ (No. 1, L. 31, No. 13, L. 16):
In Inscription No. 1 Samudragupta's fame has been compared
with the pale yellow water of the river Gaṅgā, which travelling
by many paths, purifies the three worlds, flowing quickly on
being liberated from confinement in the thickets of the matted
hair of (the) god Paśupati.<sup>1</sup> In the Mandasor inscription of
Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana<sup>2</sup> it is stated that when the
river Gaṅgā was about to descend from heaven to earth, in
order to break the force of its fall, god Śiva (Paśupati) received
it in the matted hair coiled above his forehead and projecting
like a horn; its waters wandered there for a thousand years,
before they eventually reached the earth.
<div n="P"/>In Inscription No. 13, we get a reference to Gaṅgā in the
context of Skandagupta's fight with the Hūṇas, the noise of
which was heard like the roaring of (the river) Gaṅgā, making
itself noticed in their ears.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>A.C. Woolner<sup>4</sup> remarked that the name Gaṅgā does not
seem to have a convincing derivation on the Āryan side. But
we do find the word in the Uṇādi affixes. The affix Gan
comes after the root Gaṃ ‘to go’ and the word Gaṅgā is
formed.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of Gaṅgā is in the Ṛgveda.<sup>6</sup> The name
also occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> and the Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka.<sup>8</sup> We find it also in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya,<sup>9</sup> and
in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>10</sup> It is mentioned many times in
the Purāṇas<sup>11</sup> in which a good deal of religious importance is
attached to it.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Gaṅgā emerges first in the Gangotri in the district of
[Page-294+ 39]
Garhwal and proceeds in different courses from Hardwar to
Bulandshahar and from Allahabad to Rajmahal from where it
enters Bengal.<sup>13</sup>
