1. {%Gaṅgā%}¦ (No. 1, L. 31, No. 13, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>In Inscription No. 1 Samudragupta's fame has been compared
<div n="lb"/>with the pale yellow water of the river Gaṅgā, which travelling
<div n="lb"/>by many paths, purifies the three worlds, flowing quickly on
<div n="lb"/>being liberated from confinement in the thickets of the matted
<div n="lb"/>hair of (the) god Paśupati.<sup>1</sup> In the Mandasor inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana<sup>2</sup> it is stated that when the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā was about to descend from heaven to earth, in
<div n="lb"/>order to break the force of its fall, god Śiva (Paśupati) received
<div n="lb"/>it in the matted hair coiled above his forehead and projecting
<div n="lb"/>like a horn; its waters wandered there for a thousand years,
<div n="lb"/>before they eventually reached the earth.
<div n="P"/>In Inscription No. 13, we get a reference to Gaṅgā in the
<div n="lb"/>context of Skandagupta's fight with the Hūṇas, the noise of
<div n="lb"/>which was heard like the roaring of (the river) Gaṅgā, making
<div n="lb"/>itself noticed in their ears.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>A.C. Woolner<sup>4</sup> remarked that the name Gaṅgā does not
<div n="lb"/>seem to have a convincing derivation on the Āryan side. But
<div n="lb"/>we do find the word in the Uṇādi affixes. The affix Gan
<div n="lb"/>comes after the root Gaṃ ‘to go’ and the word Gaṅgā is
<div n="lb"/>formed.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of Gaṅgā is in the Ṛgveda.<sup>6</sup> The name
<div n="lb"/>also occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> and the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyaka.<sup>8</sup> We find it also in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya,<sup>9</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>10</sup> It is mentioned many times in
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas<sup>11</sup> in which a good deal of religious importance is
<div n="lb"/>attached to it.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Gaṅgā emerges first in the Gangotri in the district of
[Page-294+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Garhwal and proceeds in different courses from Hardwar to
<div n="lb"/>Bulandshahar and from Allahabad to Rajmahal from where it
<div n="lb"/>enters Bengal.<sup>13</sup>
