<div n="lb"/>The inscriptions name Mahārājā Ghaṭotkaca as the successor
<div n="lb"/>of Gupta. He should not be confused with Ghaṭotkacagupta
<div n="lb"/>whose name occurs on some seals found at Vaīśālī, and also
<div n="lb"/>in the Tumain Inscription of Kumāragupta and Ghaṭotkaca-
<div n="lb"/>gupta (G. E. 116).<sup>46</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ghaṭotkaca was the name of a son of Bhīma-sena by the
<div n="lb"/>Rākṣasī Hiḍimbā.<sup>47</sup> Names based on {%Ghaṭa%} are very rare in
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit literature. Thus Gaṇeśa is named Ghaṭodara ‘pot-
<div n="lb"/>bellied’.<sup>48</sup> The name Ghaṭotkaca refers to the practice of
<div n="lb"/>bearing traditional names based on Epics and Purāṇas. Deriva-
<div n="lb"/>tively it means a person having a hairless head.<sup>49</sup> In Prācīna
<div n="lb"/>Caritrakośa it has been suggested that Ghaṭotkaca was so
<div n="lb"/>called as his head was like a {%ghaṭa%} (pitcher) and was hairless.<sup>50</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Purāṇa that
<div n="lb"/>Ghaṭotkaca was so called as he produced a loud voice while
<div n="lb"/>laughing which may be compared to the voice produced by
<div n="lb"/>thumping the pitcher quite aloud at its mouth by hands.<sup>51</sup> But
[Page-021+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the first derivation seems to be more plausible from linguistic
<div n="lb"/>point of view<sup>52</sup> while the other explanation may be more
<div n="lb"/>important from socio-psychological or mythological point of
<div n="lb"/>view.
<div n="P"/>It is possible that it was the nickname of Ghaṭotkaca which
<div n="lb"/>might have become his famous name.
