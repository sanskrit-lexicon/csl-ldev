5. {%Hūṇa%}¦ (No. 13, L. 15):
They are mentioned in the Bhītarī Stone Pillar Inscription
of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455 — 467) is
stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By
whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when
he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirl-
pool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.<sup>107</sup> The defeat
inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly
half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their
depredations.<sup>108</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a
Central Asian tribe.
<div n="P"/>Uigur<sup>109</sup> transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient
Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’,
the other {%‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’.%} The first part ({%xun%} — ) of the last
form is not in doubt and neither is the {%u%} of the last part, the
only question is about the change of the initial {%i%} of ancient
Chinese into {%y%} in Uigur before {%u%} and in Sandhi, and about
the pronunciation of the final consonant.<sup>110</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close
to the {%Hunu%} as to the Sanskrit {%Hūṇa%} is very similar to the
[Page-132+ 39]
Chinese “transcription” {%Xunu%} or {%Xūnu,%} and Avesta {%Hunu,%}
except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel {%‘u’%}
the stem final — a characteristic of the names of peoples in that
language. “The Purāṇas have a form {%Urṇa%} which together with
Epic Skr. {%Hūṇa%} suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, {%Xūrnu%}”.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here the Tibetan {%Hor,%} which corresponds
with the first syllable of the reconstructed form {%Hūr-ṇa.%} The
difference of vowels may indicate a back diphthong or back
vowel between {%o%} and {%u,%} as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since
the Greeks wrote {%u (y)%} for Indic {%u.%}<sup>112</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form,
we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were
applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns,
Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have
been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosi-
birians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have
been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that
there must have been several subject people and subject armies
in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and
mutual influence — ethnic, linguistic and cultural.<sup>113</sup> Otto
Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the
basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology,
and archaeology<sup>114</sup> and has pointed out that the greater part
of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol<sup>115</sup> Later
Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the
{%Hsiung%}-nu and {%Huns%} were Turks.<sup>116</sup>
<div n="P"/>Louis Bazin<sup>117</sup> and Von Gabain<sup>118</sup> also reached the conclu-
sion that in language of the {%Hsiung-nu%} there was a high percent-
age of Turkish words.<sup>119</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the second century B.C. the {%Hiung-nu (Huns)%} started a
movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying
the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence
of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central
Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half
of the fourth century A.D., a branch of them, the White Huns,
or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time
when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of
Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had
begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their
[Page-133+ 39]
horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the
Guptas into pieces’.<sup>120</sup>
<div n="P"/>In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia.
Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a
vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.<sup>121</sup> We know
of a {%Hūṇa-deśa%} placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to
the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of
heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab
region practically suggesting the same area.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king
of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the
Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their
king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.<sup>123</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription<sup>124</sup>
and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.<sup>125</sup> These
two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is
another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab)
referring to {%Rājādhirāja Mahārāja%} Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla),
whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned
in the Eraṇ Inscription,<sup>126</sup> but others regard the two as quite
different.<sup>127</sup> Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscrip-
tions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any
reference to the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain
work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).<sup>128</sup> Here
Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrab-
hāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a
scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rāja-
taraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas
or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal<sup>130</sup> and Fleet<sup>131</sup> held that
Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow<sup>132</sup> holds that Tora-
māṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed,
and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the
Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a
new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.<sup>133</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian
literature. D.C. Sircar<sup>134</sup> opines that the Indian names {%Hūṇa,%}
[Page-134+ 39]
{%Hārahūṇa%} or {%Hārahūra,%} supposed to be associated with the
Chinese name {%Hiung-nu%} and ‘the White Hun’ of the European
writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata
and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be
roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the
Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘{%ajayad-gupta%} (or Japto or
Jarto) {%Hūṇān%}’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to
express an event which occurred within the life-time of the
author.<sup>135</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman<sup>136</sup> a reference
is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named.
The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed coun-
tries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas
could subdue.<sup>137</sup>
<div n="P"/>The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier
bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was
pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm
of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.<sup>138</sup>
<div n="P"/>With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place
not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the
early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.<sup>139</sup>
The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was
probably Narasiṃha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily over-
whelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirak-
ula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend
his power. Narasiṃhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was
forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihira-
kula but finally triumphed over his rival.<sup>140</sup>
<div n="P"/>The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed
the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to
be even a disturbing element in Indian History.<sup>141</sup> The Purāṇas
place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras,
Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.<sup>142</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Raghuvaṃśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating
the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus<sup>143</sup>, the (pale)
faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands
(who died in the battle).<sup>144</sup>
<div n="P"/>Varāhamihira<sup>145</sup> mentions them under the jurisdiction of
Ketu and places them in the North.<sup>146</sup> Dr. Upendra Thakur<sup>147</sup>
[Page-135+ 39]
remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost
lost their original name of {%Hiong-nou%} or {%Huns.%} Later the powerful
Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they
were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards
they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the
powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the {%Hiong-nou%} or
{%Huns%} received different names in different periods beginning
with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In
spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts
of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their
exact origin and ethnic affinities.
<div n="P"/>We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their
merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols
but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa
(a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in
the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-Malwa-
Gujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced
by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and
also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings
of Bengal<sup>148</sup>
