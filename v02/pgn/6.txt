6. {%Govindagupta:%}¦ (No. 42, L. 2; No. 32, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His
<div n="lb"/>mother's name was Dhruvasvāminī. No. 32 explains the basis
<div n="lb"/>of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta,
<div n="lb"/>produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who
<div n="lb"/>was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues,
<div n="lb"/>and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons
<div n="lb"/>and gods.”<sup>77</sup> The poet means that Govindagupta resembled
<div n="lb"/>demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual
<div n="lb"/>virtues.
<div n="P"/>Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his
<div n="lb"/>father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years,
<div n="lb"/>the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II
<div n="lb"/>(G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E.
<div n="lb"/>96).<sup>78</sup> P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 412 and 415.<sup>79</sup> That Govindagupta could have ruled as
<div n="lb"/>emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the
<div n="lb"/>fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta
<div n="lb"/>does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta and his successors.<sup>80</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted
<div n="lb"/>Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession,
<div n="lb"/>avoided all references to his elder brother.<sup>81</sup>
