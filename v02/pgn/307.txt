1. {%Dāmasvāminī%}¦ (No. 55, LL. 3-4):
<div n="lb"/>She is said to have raised a pillar in the memory of her dead
<div n="lb"/>parents at Rājghāṭ in Vārāṇasī.
<div n="P"/>The first part of the name, Dāman, means a ‘rope’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘girdle’<sup>1</sup> (originally ‘bond’, from {%§dā%} ‘to bind’). But the
<div n="lb"/>Amarakośa gives a better explanation which takes us nearer
<div n="lb"/>to the original meaning. It explains {%‘Dāman’%} as {%‘Sandānam’,%}
<div n="lb"/>i. e., a rope tethered to a cow at the time of milking it.<sup>2</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>second part of the name is {%‘svāminī’%} which means ‘a propri-
<div n="lb"/>etress, mistress’ or owner of (gen., loc. or comp.).<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The parents might have given her this name out of affec-
<div n="lb"/>tion as she was a helping hand in tethering the rope to the
<div n="lb"/>cow while milking it.<sup>4</sup> The name indicates affection by the
<div n="lb"/>parents.
