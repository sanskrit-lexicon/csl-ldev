1. {%Dāmasvāminī%}¦ (No. 55, LL. 3-4):
She is said to have raised a pillar in the memory of her dead
parents at Rājghāṭ in Vārāṇasī.
<div n="P"/>The first part of the name, Dāman, means a ‘rope’ or
‘girdle’<sup>1</sup> (originally ‘bond’, from {%§dā%} ‘to bind’). But the
Amarakośa gives a better explanation which takes us nearer
to the original meaning. It explains {%‘Dāman’%} as {%‘Sandānam’,%}
i. e., a rope tethered to a cow at the time of milking it.<sup>2</sup> The
second part of the name is {%‘svāminī’%} which means ‘a propri-
etress, mistress’ or owner of (gen., loc. or comp.).<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The parents might have given her this name out of affec-
tion as she was a helping hand in tethering the rope to the
cow while milking it.<sup>4</sup> The name indicates affection by the
parents.
