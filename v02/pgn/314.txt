1. {%Ābhīra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta.
Ābhīras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may
also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which
may have been the original home of the Ābhīras. In the 3rd
century A.D. there was an Ābhīra kingdom in the north-
western Deccan.<sup>21</sup> D.C. Sircar<sup>22</sup> describes Ābhīra in singular as
a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be
traced in the present Ahīras,<sup>23</sup> who in tribal groups, abound
largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions
of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people,
mostly cowherds and agriculturists.<sup>24</sup> This tribe<sup>25</sup> is thought to
have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of
Kṛṣṇa Govinda<sup>26</sup> in his pastoral aspect.
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>27</sup> places the Ābhīras in West Rajasthan
‘where the Sarasvatī disappears’.
<div n="P"/>In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in
the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar,
as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of
Ptolemy.<sup>28</sup> The Periplus calls their country Abiria. Ābhīra
generals served in the armies of Śaka Kṣatraps of Western
India in the second century A.D. as is known from their
inscriptions.<sup>29</sup> They are also mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya
of Patañjali<sup>30</sup> in association with the Śūdras, the Sodrai of
Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout
the third century A.D. the Ābhīras exercised ruling power in
northern Konkan and Mahārāshtra.<sup>31</sup> Vātsyāyana<sup>32</sup> refers to
the Harem of the Ābhīra kings. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa<sup>33</sup>
[Page-126+ 39]
and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>34</sup> refer to them as ‘Dakṣiṇāpatha-vāsinaḥ’
or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>35</sup>
mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of Śani
(Saturn).
<div n="P"/>The Jodhpur Inscription of Saṃvat 918, records that the
Ābhīra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours,
because of their violent demeanour.<sup>36</sup> The Ābhīra robbers are
also mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa.<sup>37</sup> Epigraphic evidence
indicates the existence of an Ābhīra kingdom in the 14th
Century in Khandesh.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhitya Darpaṇa of Viśvanātha,<sup>39</sup> it is stated that
Ābhīrī is the language of the Ābhīras and Cāṇḍālī of the
Caṇḍālas. Those who do woodwork can speak Ābhīrī or Śābarī,
either of the two. Daṇḍin asserts that the speeches of the
Ābhīras, etc., are termed as Apabhraṃśa in the Kāvya<sup>40</sup> on
the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics
passed into Apabhraṃśa as a result of the activities of the
Ābhīras and the Gurjaras.<sup>41</sup> We know from the Amarakośa<sup>42</sup>
that ‘Ābhīrī’ was used to denote ‘Ābhīra woman or the wife of
a cowherd’.
<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa<sup>43</sup> mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṃkhya,
Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Ābhīra and says that
the village or place where Ābhīras lived is named as Ghoṣa or
Ābhīrapallī.<sup>44</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kashmirian recension of the Mahābhārata we get
the readings ‘Kābhīra’ and ‘Kabhīra’ in place of Ābhīra.<sup>45</sup>
These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt
to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the
Ābhīras. The Kasmiras probably knew the Ābhīras at an early
date.<sup>46</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattacharya<sup>47</sup> describes the Ābhīrs or Ahīrs as a cowherd
caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in
India north of the Narmadā. The Ābhīras are mentioned as
foreigners in the Purāṇas.<sup>48</sup> Their kings were regarded as
vrātya and mostly śūdras (black).<sup>49</sup> In the Mahābhārata the
Ābhīras are called Mleccha.<sup>50</sup> According to Manu<sup>51</sup> they were
the sons of a brāhmaṇa man and an ambaṣṭha woman, the
Ambaṣṭhas being of mixed origin and known as the Ānava
kṣatriyas.<sup>52</sup> The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>53</sup> places the Ābhīras in the
[Page-127+ 39]
Southern quarter of India.
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>54</sup> considers them to be an admixture possibly of
white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a
a very dark colour and concludes that they were western
Ānavas.<sup>55</sup>
