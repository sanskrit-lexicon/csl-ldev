2. {%Buddha%}¦ (No. 23, LL. 6-7):
He has been given the epithet ‘The Divine’ (Bhagavān Buddha).
He is mentioned in connection with a Buddhist temple. Literally
the name means awakened, conscious or intelligent. For
Buddhists it stands for a fully enlightened man who has
achieved perfect knowledge of the truth and thereby is liberated
from all existence and before his own attainment of Nirvāṇa
reveals the method of obtaining it. The principal Buddha of
the present age was born at Kapilavastu in the year 566 B.C.<sup>61</sup>
His father Śuddhodana was the Rājā of that district. His
mother was Māyādevī, and his original name was Siddhārtha.
He belonged to the Kṣatriya Śākya tribe, while Gautama
seems to refer to the race to which his family belonged. He
had left his home in quest of truth and after a concentrated

meditation for a few years attained the discovery of truths
and was called the Buddha or the enlightened.<sup>62</sup>
