8. {%Kotas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 14):
The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions
Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the
Kotas.<sup>162</sup> Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription
with king Kalyāṇavarman of the play ‘Kaumudī-Mahotsava’.<sup>163</sup>
But it is now generally believed<sup>164</sup> that ‘the episode of the
Kaumudī-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early
Gupta History’.
<div n="P"/>The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found
in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the
Upper Gangetic valley’.<sup>165</sup> Scholars differ in their views
about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja
while others with Pāṭaliputra.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is known that Puṣpapura or Kusumapura was the name of
both the Pāṭaliputra and Kānyakubja.<sup>167</sup> It must, however, be
noted that the city of Puṣpa here is connected mainly with
Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,<sup>168</sup> so the location
of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or
Puṣpapura. It is well known that Candragupta I received
Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that
Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pāṭaliputra
({%Puṣpa-āhvaye krīḍatā%}). So Goyal's assumption that ‘Hariṣeṇa
has referred to Kānyakubja and not Pāṭaliputra’<sup>169</sup> is incorrect.
It is only later that Kānyakubja gains the honour of being
called Kusumapura when the glory of Pāṭaliputra had started
declining.<sup>170</sup>
<div n="P"/>In view of the context of the victory over Kota-kulaja
along with the Nāga kings Acyuta and Nāgasena and with the
support of numismatic evidence it may be said that the kotas
lived somewhere between East Punjab and Delhi.
