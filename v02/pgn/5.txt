He is mentioned as {%‘apratiratha’, ‘paramabhāgavata’ ‘mahārājā-%}
{%dhirāja’%} and a son of {%mahārājādhirāja%} Śrī Samudragupta born
of his chief queen Dattadevī;<sup>69</sup> or as {%Bhaṭṭāraka-mahārājādhirāja,%}
the good son of the {%Bhaṭṭāraka-mahārājādhirāja,%} the illustrious
Samudragupta;<sup>70</sup> or in one case simply as a king (rājā) in No.

[Page-023+ 39]
mentioned by other names as well. Devarāja as his favourite
name ({%priyanāma%}) is mentioned in No. 5, L. 7.<sup>71</sup> In the Poona
copper plate inscription of Prabhāvatīguptā and the Ridhapura
grants of Prabhāvatīguptā her father's name is Candragupta.<sup>72</sup>
The Chammak copper plate inscription of Vākāṭaka king
Pravarasena II, however, names Prabhāvatīguptā's father as
Devagupta.<sup>73</sup> This proves that Devagupta was another name
of Candragupta. Candragupta had a third name, Deva-Śrī,
which appears on his Archer and Conch-types of Coins.<sup>74</sup> No.
32, L. 2 Justifies his name Candragupta ‘who is like a moon
in the galaxy of Gupta kings with the famous name Candra-
gupta’.<sup>75</sup> No. 20, L. 5 refers to his quality of handsomeness.
‘His name was Candra and he was holding the glory of a full
moon on his face’.<sup>76</sup>
