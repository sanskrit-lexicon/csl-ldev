2. {%Chagalaga%}¦ (No. 3, L. 2):
A mahārāja, grandfather of a {%mahārāja%} whose name in line 2 is
illegible and who belonged to the Sanakānīka tribe or family,
who was a feudatory of Candragupta II. We find the word
{%Chagala%} literally meaning ‘a hegoat’<sup>48</sup> in the Uṇādi-sūtras of
Pāṇini where it is the name of a Ṛṣi.<sup>49</sup> It seems to be a non-
Āryan word. The words Chagala, Chagalaka or Chagalaga
mean the same.<sup>50</sup>
