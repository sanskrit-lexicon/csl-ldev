1. {%Kuladāsa%}¦ (No. 43, L. 10):
[Page-072+ 38]
{%Kula%} means ‘race, family, community’.<sup>6</sup> {%Dāsa%} means servant.
So the whole will literally mean ‘a servant of the community or
family’. Dharmaśāstras prescribe {%‘dāsa’%} to be used by śūdras at
the end of their names but we do not find any strict adherence
to this rule by the society. {%Dāsa-%} ending names show devotion.
We have such names as ‘Kulabhūṣaṇa’ based on the word
{%‘kula’.%}
