14. {%Viṣṇuvardhaki-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>The field of Viṣṇuvardhaki. Viṣṇu is the first part of the name
<div n="lb"/>based on god Viṣṇu. The second part of his name seems to be
<div n="lb"/>dropped and instead his professional epithet ‘vardhakin’ has
<div n="lb"/>been added which means ‘a carpenter’.<sup>519</sup> In Sāñcī Stūpa Ins-
<div n="lb"/>criptions we get the word ‘vaḍakina’ which is the same as San-
<div n="lb"/>skrit ‘vardhakin’ and means ‘carpenter’.<sup>520</sup> In the Aṅga-
<div n="lb"/>vijjā,<sup>521</sup> we get the word ‘vaṭṭaki’ which denotes a metal
<div n="lb"/>worker.
