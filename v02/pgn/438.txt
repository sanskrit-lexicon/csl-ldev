14. {%Viṣṇuvardhaki-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 19):
The field of Viṣṇuvardhaki. Viṣṇu is the first part of the name
based on god Viṣṇu. The second part of his name seems to be
dropped and instead his professional epithet ‘vardhakin’ has
been added which means ‘a carpenter’.<sup>519</sup> In Sāñcī Stūpa Ins-
criptions we get the word ‘vaḍakina’ which is the same as San-
skrit ‘vardhakin’ and means ‘carpenter’.<sup>520</sup> In the Aṅga-
vijjā,<sup>521</sup> we get the word ‘vaṭṭaki’ which denotes a metal
worker.
