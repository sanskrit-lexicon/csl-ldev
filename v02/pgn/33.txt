1. {%Prabhākara%}¦ (No. 32, L. 8):
He is described as a king (bhūmipati) and a destroyer of the
enemies of the Gupta dynasty. He was the overlord of Datta-
bhaṭa. He is not known from any other source. The name of his
capital or territory is not mentioned. Probably he was the con-
temporary local chief of Daśapura and a feudatory ally of the
Guptas in their struggle against the Hūṇas.<sup>9</sup> Dattabhaṭa does
not include in the inscription the genealogy of his master. It is
possible that Prabhākara was a self-made man who did not
have a distinguished ancestor worthy of record. He may have
been appointed as a ruler of Daśapura by the paramount
power, after the extinction of the Varman dynasty.<sup>10</sup> That
Prabhākara was not a scion of the Varman dynasty would also
appear from his name which, unlike the names of the known
members of that dynasty, does not end in Varman.<sup>11</sup> The
name violates the laws of Gṛhyasūtras which forbid the direct
imposition of the names of deities upon human-beings.
