2. {%Divākaranandin%}¦ (No. 28, L, 10):
The first part is {%‘Divākara’%} (day-maker), which is another name
of god Sun.<sup>22</sup> {%Nandin%} here is a name-ending suffix literally
meaning ‘the happy one’ and is the name of Viṣṇu, Śiva and
an attendant of Śiva. This name-ending was not known in the
time of Pāṇini. According to Sankalia names directly after
deities were probably after the family-god,<sup>23</sup> which in the pre-
sent case seems to have been Śiva. It is possible that the first
part of the name was connected with same deity and than the
name of the family-deity was added as the name-ending surname.
<div n="P"/>The word nandin is generally used to refer to ‘an attendant
of Śiva’ or the {%vāhana ‘nandīn’%} bull of Śiva. So the name
Divākarnandin may literally mean ‘an attendant of god Sun’.
The word {%Nandin%} also means ‘gladdening’.<sup>24</sup> So another inter-
pretation can be ‘one who pleases or wins over Lord Sun’.
