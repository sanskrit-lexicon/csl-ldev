<div n="lb"/>(= my dear child).<sup>79</sup> Originally it was used for a calf, then for
<div n="lb"/>the young of any animal and finally for any offspring or child.
<div n="lb"/>The child or the young of any animal being lovely, it became
<div n="lb"/>a term of endearment. The second part of the present name
<div n="lb"/>is {%bhaṭṭi%} which is a variation of {%bhaṭṭa.%} Bhaṭṭi is formed from
<div n="lb"/>{%‘bhartṛ’%} meaning ‘lord’.<sup>80</sup>
