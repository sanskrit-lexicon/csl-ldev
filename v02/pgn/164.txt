8. {%Vatsabhaṭṭi%}¦ (No. 17, L. 23):
The Mandasor Stone Inscription of Kumāragupta and Bandhu-
varman (the Mālava years 493 and 529) was composed by
Vatsabhaṭṭi.<sup>78</sup> Vatsa is often used as a term of endearment
(= my dear child).<sup>79</sup> Originally it was used for a calf, then for
the young of any animal and finally for any offspring or child.
The child or the young of any animal being lovely, it became
a term of endearment. The second part of the present name
is {%bhaṭṭi%} which is a variation of {%bhaṭṭa.%} Bhaṭṭi is formed from
{%‘bhartṛ’%} meaning ‘lord’.<sup>80</sup>
