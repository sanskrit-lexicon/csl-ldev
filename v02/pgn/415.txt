3. {%Vaṭa-gohālī%}¦ (No. 28, L. 2, L. 6, L. 7, L. 12, L. 14):
It was a village situated in the Palāśāṭṭa Pārśva within the
Nāgiraṭṭa maṇḍala in the Dakṣiṇāṃśaka vīthī. It has been
identified with the village of Goālbhīṭā near Pāhāṛpur.<sup>467</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vaṭa is perhaps the Prakritic form of vṛtta meaning ‘surro-
unded, covered’.<sup>468</sup> The village may have been surrounded by a
well or fence. On one hand we find another village named as
‘Trivṛtā’,<sup>469</sup> and on the other Vaṭa-nagara appears as the name
of a town and Vaṭodaka as the name of a river.<sup>470</sup>
