(7) {%Kusthalapura%}¦ (No. I, L. 20):
Kusthalapura ruled by Dhanañjaya is mentioned as one of
the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms subdued by Samudragupta. Smith
takes it to be a mistake for Kuśasthalapura,<sup>278</sup> and identifies
it with the holy city of Dwarka, the capital of Ānartta, i. e.
North Gujarat.<sup>279</sup> Raj Bali Pandey also identifies it with
Kuśasthalī (Dwarka)<sup>280</sup> G. Ramdas locates the place in
Gujarat following Smith.<sup>281</sup> Monier Williams also identifies
Kuśasthala with the town of Dwarka.<sup>282</sup> Bhandarkar, follow-
ing Barnett identifies the place with Kuttalur near Polur in
North Arcot.<sup>283</sup>
<div n="P"/>This Kuśasthalī is not situated in Gujarat but presumably on
the eastern spurs of the Vindhya range near Daksiṇakosala.<sup>284</sup>
It was the capital of Kuśa, son of Rāmacandra.<sup>285</sup> But its
[Page-230+ 39]
position in the list of the States of Dakṣiṇāpatha indicates a
place a little more to the south.
<div n="P"/>By the process of Haplology,<sup>286</sup> Kuśasthalapura is simpli-
fied into Kusthalapura which may be changed to Kuśasthalī
or Kuśāvatī in short.
<div n="P"/>The suffix sthala or sthalī is significant: it suggests a high-
lying country, an eminence, tableland, or dry-land as opposed
to a damp low-land.<sup>287</sup> The Mahābhārata, Harivaṃśa, early
Jain and Pali literature use the word in this sense.<sup>288</sup> The
Mahābhārata mentions both Kuśasthala as well as kuśa-sthalī.
The latter is supposed to be another name of Dwarka.<sup>289</sup>
