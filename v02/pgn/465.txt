2. {%Kākanādaboṭa%}¦ (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2):
In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the
Ārya Saṃgha or the Community of the faithful, at the great
Vihāra, or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa,<sup>700</sup> for the
purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar takes ‘Kākanādaboṭa’ to be the old name of
Sāñcī.<sup>701</sup> Fleet is of the view that the Kākanādaboṭa convent
is the Great Stūpa itself. According to him the word Boṭa is
another form of Poṭa which means ‘the foundation of a
house’.<sup>702</sup> Fleet further writes that the name ‘Kākanāda’ lit.
‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sāñcī itself
which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan
characters found at Sāñcī.<sup>703</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus, it is clear that Kākanāda was the ancient name of
Sāñcī in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya
Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.<sup>704</sup> The word ‘boṭa’
is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Kākanāda’ will refer to the
great stūpa itself. Its form Poṭa meaning the foundation of a
house is untenable because the word ‘vihāra’ in that very sense
appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘boṭa’ has been used here
in the sense of an ascetic cult.<sup>705</sup> It is a Prakrit word which has
been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant
expression means ‘in the holy great vihāra of the Buddhist cult
(assembly) at Kākanāda’.
<div n="P"/>Fleet is wrong in translating the word Kākanāda to mean
‘the noise of the crow’.<sup>706</sup> K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise
of the Kākas’<sup>707</sup> is more to the point. We know of the Kākas,
an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad In-
scription of Samudragupta.<sup>708</sup> In Eastern Malwa we have two
ancient place-names connected with the Kākas. One is the hill
now called Sāñcī hill (the ancient) Kākanāda. The other is an
ancient village called Kāka-pura, some 20 miles north of
Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.<sup>709</sup>
