2. {%Kākanādaboṭa%}¦ (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the
<div n="lb"/>Ārya Saṃgha or the Community of the faithful, at the great
<div n="lb"/>Vihāra, or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa,<sup>700</sup> for the
<div n="lb"/>purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar takes ‘Kākanādaboṭa’ to be the old name of
<div n="lb"/>Sāñcī.<sup>701</sup> Fleet is of the view that the Kākanādaboṭa convent
<div n="lb"/>is the Great Stūpa itself. According to him the word Boṭa is
<div n="lb"/>another form of Poṭa which means ‘the foundation of a
<div n="lb"/>house’.<sup>702</sup> Fleet further writes that the name ‘Kākanāda’ lit.
<div n="lb"/>‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sāñcī itself
<div n="lb"/>which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan
<div n="lb"/>characters found at Sāñcī.<sup>703</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus, it is clear that Kākanāda was the ancient name of
<div n="lb"/>Sāñcī in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya
<div n="lb"/>Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.<sup>704</sup> The word ‘boṭa’
<div n="lb"/>is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Kākanāda’ will refer to the
<div n="lb"/>great stūpa itself. Its form Poṭa meaning the foundation of a
<div n="lb"/>house is untenable because the word ‘vihāra’ in that very sense
<div n="lb"/>appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘boṭa’ has been used here
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of an ascetic cult.<sup>705</sup> It is a Prakrit word which has
<div n="lb"/>been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant
<div n="lb"/>expression means ‘in the holy great vihāra of the Buddhist cult
<div n="lb"/>(assembly) at Kākanāda’.
<div n="P"/>Fleet is wrong in translating the word Kākanāda to mean
<div n="lb"/>‘the noise of the crow’.<sup>706</sup> K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise
<div n="lb"/>of the Kākas’<sup>707</sup> is more to the point. We know of the Kākas,
<div n="lb"/>an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad In-
<div n="lb"/>scription of Samudragupta.<sup>708</sup> In Eastern Malwa we have two
<div n="lb"/>ancient place-names connected with the Kākas. One is the hill
<div n="lb"/>now called Sāñcī hill (the ancient) Kākanāda. The other is an
<div n="lb"/>ancient village called Kāka-pura, some 20 miles north of
<div n="lb"/>Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.<sup>709</sup>
