1. {%Kāmanakuṇḍa%}¦ (No. 43, L. 11):
It should be taken as Kāmanākuṇḍa. The word {%kāmanā%} means
‘desire’. The second part {%‘kuṇḍa’%} seems to be a family surname.
Literally it means a bowl, pitcher, a vessel for coals, or a round
hole in the ground (for receiving and preserving water or fire.
Cf. Agnikuṇḍa).<sup>22</sup> It is a Dravidian word.<sup>23</sup> We have the
names of mohallas ending in ‘kuṇḍa’, such as Durgākuṇḍa,
Agastyakuṇḍa, Lakṣmīkuṇḍa in Vārāṇasī.
<div n="P"/>As a surname, we find its use for the Nāgara brāhmaṇas.<sup>24</sup>
We find many brāhmaṇa surnames popular among the kāyas-

thas of Bengal.<sup>25</sup> ‘Kuṇḍa’ though originally a brāhmaṇa sur-
name is now a non-brāhmaṇa surname in Bengal. Some of the
people possessing the {%kuṇḍa%} surname are found to be oil-men
by profession. Its corrupt form {%kuṇḍu%} is also found.
