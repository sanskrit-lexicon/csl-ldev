 {%Bhukti%}¦ (from §bhuj)
<div n="P"/>Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.<sup>43</sup> Bhukti
denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern
Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern
India under the Guptas and Pratihāras it denoted a unit as
large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.<sup>44</sup> Thus
[Page-212+ 39]
Pratiṣṭhānabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppārakabhukti
of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas,<sup>45</sup> whereas
under the Guptas the Puṇḍravardhanabhukti comprised of the
districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti
included the districts of Gayā and Pāṭaliputra.<sup>46</sup> Śrāvastibhukti
under the Pratihāras included several districts in northern
U.P.<sup>47</sup> The Bhuktis under the Pratihāra empire appear to have
been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.<sup>48</sup> Bhukti
is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.<sup>49</sup> The unit bhukti
which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period
as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently
found in the early medieval period.<sup>50</sup> The mention of a
Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of
Jīvitagupta II.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find only one place name with the suffix {%bhukti%} which
is detailed below:
<div n="P"/>{%Puṇḍravardhana%} (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34,
L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43,
L. 14):
<div n="P"/>This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging
from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443
to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this
period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kula-
putra) Amṛtadeva by name belonging to Ayodhyā approached
the local government of Koṭivarṣa of which Svyambhudeva
was the governor, under the provincial government of Puṇḍra-
vardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bhānugupta, and prayed
that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document
in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free
waste lands. His prayer was granted.
<div n="P"/>General Cunningham<sup>52</sup> identifies Puṇḍravardhana with the
extensive ruins known as ‘Mahāsthāngarh’, 8 miles north of
the town of Bogra. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line
between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.<sup>53</sup> According
to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Puṇḍradeśa included the
districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and
Tirhut.<sup>54</sup> It seems to have been the biggest administrative
division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several
viṣayas and maṇḍalas of which twenty-four<sup>55</sup> are mentioned
[Page-213+ 38]
in known epigraphs. In short Puṇḍravardhana signified North
Bengal.
<div n="P"/>Puṇḍravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of
the Puṇḍras.<sup>56</sup> The first reference to the Puṇḍras is found in
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>57</sup> The earliest literary reference to
Puṇḍravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the
Divyāvadāna, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of
India.<sup>58</sup> The Pauṇḍra country is mentioned also in the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā,<sup>59</sup> as situated in the east.<sup>60</sup> The Kāvyamīṃāṃsā also
mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of
Bengal the name Puṇḍravardhana was changed into Pauṇḍra-
vardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs
first in the Manahali grant of Madanapāla and remained in use
till the end of the Sena rule. The Rājataraṅgiṇī mentions
Puṇḍravardhana as the capital of Gauḍa which is also proved
by a reference in Puruṣottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the
12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital
to Gauḍa in the Malda district. Towards the end of the 13th
or the beginning of the 14th century A.D. Puṇḍravardhana was
occupied by the Muhammedans.<sup>62</sup>
