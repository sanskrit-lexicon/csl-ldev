4. {%Vaṅga%}¦ (No. 20, L. I):
<div n="lb"/>In this inscription, king Candra, “on whose arm fame was
<div n="lb"/>inscribed by the sword, when in battle in Vaṅga countries, is
<div n="lb"/>stated to have kneaded, back with his breast the enemies who,
<div n="lb"/>uniting together, came against him”.<sup>713</sup> This is taken by
<div n="lb"/>scholars<sup>714</sup> to be the first epigraphic mention of Vaṅga. The
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅgas here mean the ‘Vaṅga country’ the eastern Bengal of
<div n="lb"/>modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Vaṅgas
<div n="lb"/>of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the
<div n="lb"/>people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.<sup>715</sup> But the
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅgas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the
<div n="lb"/>victory of king Candra over the Vaṅga countries has no con-
<div n="lb"/>nection with his conquest of the Vāhlikas. Both are separately
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the
<div n="lb"/>plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the
<div n="lb"/>tribe.<sup>716</sup> The Vaṅga countries are also referred to in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahākūṭa Pillar Inscription,<sup>717</sup> but in the inscriptions after
<div n="lb"/>the 9th century A.D. the word Vaṅgāla is usually mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed.<sup>718</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Vaṅgas along with the Magadhas
<div n="lb"/>is in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>719</sup> The name is also found in the
<div n="lb"/>Baudhāyana Dharma-Sūtra<sup>720</sup> where the Vaṅgas are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as impure people.<sup>721</sup> But the Drama ‘Pratijñā-Yaugandha-
<div n="lb"/>rāyaṇa’ (Act II), ascribed to Bhāsa and probably not older
<div n="lb"/>than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for
<div n="lb"/>intermarriage with the royal family of Mālava.<sup>722</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of Vaṅga are stated to have fought in the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kshetra war<sup>723</sup> and, in course of his expedition Bhīṣma is said
<div n="lb"/>to have defeated Samudrasena of Vaṅga.<sup>724</sup> The Kāśikā men-
<div n="lb"/>tions Vāṅgaka to explain Pāṇini's sūtra (IV. 3. 100) denoting
[Page-267+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>loyalty of the citizen to the state.<sup>725</sup> Pāṇini mentions Vāṅgī
<div n="lb"/>(the lady of Vaṅga Janapada) along with Avantī, Kurū and
<div n="lb"/>Yaudheyī.<sup>726</sup> Patañjali also refers to the Vaṅgas by way of
<div n="lb"/>illustration.<sup>727</sup> Kauṭilya makes similar references to the
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>728</sup> The Bhāgavata Purāṇa also mentions it as a
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>729</sup> Kālidāsa states that Raghu after conquering the
<div n="lb"/>Sumhas,<sup>730</sup> defeated the Vaṅgas with his force.<sup>731</sup> The Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>mīmāṃsā mentions Vaṅga as a janapada situated in the east.<sup>732</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā also mentions it in the east along with Upa-
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅga.<sup>733</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Mahābhārata<sup>734</sup> Vaṅga, son of Bali, had
<div n="lb"/>established this country. The Amarakośa<sup>735</sup> mentions Vaṅga
<div n="lb"/>as a synonym of Raṅga (lead), but lead is not available
<div n="lb"/>in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and
<div n="lb"/>East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received
<div n="lb"/>lead through the people of East Bengal. Suśruta also uses
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅga in the same sense as Amara does<sup>736</sup>
<div n="P"/>R.C. Banerji<sup>737</sup>, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the
<div n="lb"/>Kalacuri king Bijjala<sup>738</sup> takes Vaṅga and Vaṅgāla as two dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by
<div n="lb"/>S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>739</sup> who concludes that Vaṅgāla was within Vaṅga
<div n="lb"/>and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity
<div n="lb"/>as is maintained by some.
<div n="P"/>The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographi-
<div n="lb"/>cal location of the Vaṅga country changed in different periods.
<div n="lb"/>The same country Vaṅga was known as Vaṅgāla with the addi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the Prakrit suffix {%‘āla’%}<sup>740</sup> which was transliterated by the
<div n="lb"/>Muslims as Bangālah (pronouncing Bangāla) in their script<sup>741</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and this was changed into Bengal by the English people.
<div n="P"/>The Yādavaprakāśa equates Vaṅga with Harikeli<sup>742</sup> but
<div n="lb"/>the Kalpadrukośa, a work of the seventeenth century states that
<div n="lb"/>Śrīhaṭṭa is Harikeli.<sup>743</sup> The commentary of Yaśodhara on the
<div n="lb"/>Kāmasūtra refers to Vaṅga as situated to the east of the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaputra.<sup>744</sup>
