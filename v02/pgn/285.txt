9. {%Jitasena%}¦ (No. 52, L. 30):
<div n="lb"/>The first part of the name {%‘Jita’%} means ‘won’. ‘Sena’ the second
<div n="lb"/>part of the name, generally refers to an army but in the present
<div n="lb"/>case we may translate it better as ‘body’ which is supported by
<div n="lb"/>lexicographers.<sup>36</sup> Thus the whole may literally mean ‘One who
<div n="lb"/>has won the body’, i.e. one having control over one's senses’.
<div n="lb"/>This would suit the context because Jitasena was an ācāryya
<div n="lb"/>of the Buddhist order.<sup>37</sup>
