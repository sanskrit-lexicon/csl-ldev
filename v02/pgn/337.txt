2. {%Bāhlīka%}¦<sup>570</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa shows that Bāhlīka was famous for horses,
saffron and Ferula Asafoetida ({%hiṅgu%}).
<div n="P"/>The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron
on the banks of Vaṅkṣu (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the
Hūṇas as described in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>571</sup> The reading
Sindhu of the passage<sup>572</sup> is plainly a mistake for Vaṅkśu which
is corroborated by Kṣīrasvāmin, the earliest commentator of
Amara who clearly shows that the Bāhlīka country was border-
ed on the Oxus.<sup>573</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>574</sup> places Bāhlīkas in the jurisdiction of
the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Bāhlikas with the
Dhārṣṭakas, a Kṣatriya clan which occupied the Bāhlīka
country.<sup>575</sup> We know that Bāhlīkī was another name of Mādrī,
queen of the Madras.<sup>576</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the
{%Bhāllavins%} enshrined the memory of the Bāhlīkas; the modern
sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and
Behl represent the ancient Bālhīkas, and the Jāṭ clans of Bhālār
and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalkā, liv-
ing in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan
Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung
Bāhlika tribes.<sup>577</sup> There is a possibility of the Bāhlīkas migrat-
ing from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.<sup>578</sup>
<div n="P"/>When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh-
[Page-171+ 40]
ist faith,<sup>579</sup> but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by
the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territor-
ies passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the
Muhammadan power.<sup>580</sup>
