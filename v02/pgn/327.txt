14. {%Muruṇḍas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
Muruṇḍa is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of
Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, Ṣāhi Ṣāhān-
uṣāhi and Śaka as one compound expression.<sup>371</sup> Fleet takes
[Page-153+ 39]
Śakas and Muruṇḍas as two separate tribes. They were one of
the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer
allegiance to Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>According to Sten Konow {%‘muruṇḍa’%} is the later form of
a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘Śaka-
Muruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or
chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and
Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>372</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha
the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’<sup>373</sup> and Muruṇḍasvāminī<sup>374</sup> which
shows that {%Muruṇḍa%} was the name of a tribe and not a title.
<div n="P"/>On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith<sup>375</sup> suggested that “the
Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of
Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south
in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhota-
nagpur”.
<div n="P"/>According to R.K. Mookerji,<sup>376</sup> the people called here as
the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may
be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten
Konow.<sup>377</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that the term {%Daivaputra%} in the inscription has
been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are men-
tioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the
Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji.
<div n="P"/>Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful
foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.<sup>378</sup> According
to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word
equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the
Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is,
therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description
of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.<sup>379</sup> Jayaswal took Śaka-
Muruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada,
Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western
Satraps’.<sup>380</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi<sup>381</sup> and the Vaijayantī<sup>382</sup> the
{%Lampākas%} are identified with Muruṇḍas. The {%Lampākas%} are
the same as the {%Lambatai%} of Ptolemy.<sup>383</sup> The Purāṇas,<sup>384</sup>
mention {%Lampākas,%} the people who were residing in {%Lampāka,%}
the modern {%Laghman%} in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be
[Page-154+ 39]
referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.<sup>385</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is
clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.<sup>386</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the
first time under the name {%Moroundai%} and places them on the
western border of the {%‘Gangaridai’.%} They seem to have occu-
pied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar
on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They
had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita,
Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These
places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna
appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river,
and {%Aganagora%} with {%Aghadip (Agradvīpa)%} on the eastern bank
of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.<sup>387</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Cunningham, the name of the {%Marundai%} is
still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe
scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.<sup>388</sup> But M.S.
Pandey<sup>389</sup> opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas
dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence
is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so
far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. How-
ever, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been
before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre
in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality
and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized.
Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as
that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the
Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the
Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the
Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of
Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far
from their place of origin.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>391</sup> disagrees with the Puranic account on the
basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mis-
takes of the copyists.
