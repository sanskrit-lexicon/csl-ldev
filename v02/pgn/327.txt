14. {%Muruṇḍas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍa is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, Ṣāhi Ṣāhān-
<div n="lb"/>uṣāhi and Śaka as one compound expression.<sup>371</sup> Fleet takes
[Page-153+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Śakas and Muruṇḍas as two separate tribes. They were one of
<div n="lb"/>the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer
<div n="lb"/>allegiance to Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>According to Sten Konow {%‘muruṇḍa’%} is the later form of
<div n="lb"/>a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘Śaka-
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or
<div n="lb"/>chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and
<div n="lb"/>Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>372</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha
<div n="lb"/>the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’<sup>373</sup> and Muruṇḍasvāminī<sup>374</sup> which
<div n="lb"/>shows that {%Muruṇḍa%} was the name of a tribe and not a title.
<div n="P"/>On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith<sup>375</sup> suggested that “the
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of
<div n="lb"/>Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south
<div n="lb"/>in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhota-
<div n="lb"/>nagpur”.
<div n="P"/>According to R.K. Mookerji,<sup>376</sup> the people called here as
<div n="lb"/>the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may
<div n="lb"/>be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten
<div n="lb"/>Konow.<sup>377</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that the term {%Daivaputra%} in the inscription has
<div n="lb"/>been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji.
<div n="P"/>Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful
<div n="lb"/>foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.<sup>378</sup> According
<div n="lb"/>to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word
<div n="lb"/>equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the
<div n="lb"/>Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description
<div n="lb"/>of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.<sup>379</sup> Jayaswal took Śaka-
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada,
<div n="lb"/>Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western
<div n="lb"/>Satraps’.<sup>380</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi<sup>381</sup> and the Vaijayantī<sup>382</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>{%Lampākas%} are identified with Muruṇḍas. The {%Lampākas%} are
<div n="lb"/>the same as the {%Lambatai%} of Ptolemy.<sup>383</sup> The Purāṇas,<sup>384</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mention {%Lampākas,%} the people who were residing in {%Lampāka,%}
<div n="lb"/>the modern {%Laghman%} in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be
[Page-154+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.<sup>385</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is
<div n="lb"/>clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.<sup>386</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the
<div n="lb"/>first time under the name {%Moroundai%} and places them on the
<div n="lb"/>western border of the {%‘Gangaridai’.%} They seem to have occu-
<div n="lb"/>pied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar
<div n="lb"/>on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They
<div n="lb"/>had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita,
<div n="lb"/>Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These
<div n="lb"/>places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna
<div n="lb"/>appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river,
<div n="lb"/>and {%Aganagora%} with {%Aghadip (Agradvīpa)%} on the eastern bank
<div n="lb"/>of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.<sup>387</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Cunningham, the name of the {%Marundai%} is
<div n="lb"/>still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe
<div n="lb"/>scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.<sup>388</sup> But M.S.
<div n="lb"/>Pandey<sup>389</sup> opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas
<div n="lb"/>dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence
<div n="lb"/>is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so
<div n="lb"/>far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. How-
<div n="lb"/>ever, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been
<div n="lb"/>before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre
<div n="lb"/>in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality
<div n="lb"/>and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized.
<div n="lb"/>Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as
<div n="lb"/>that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the
<div n="lb"/>Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of
<div n="lb"/>Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far
<div n="lb"/>from their place of origin.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>391</sup> disagrees with the Puranic account on the
<div n="lb"/>basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mis-
<div n="lb"/>takes of the copyists.
