8. {%Vyāsa%}¦ (No. 28, L. 21; No. 29, L. 14; No. 36, L. 15; No.
<div n="lb"/>43, L. 30; No. 44, L. 21; No. 52, LL. 11-12):
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa has been mentioned as Bhagavān (venerable) Vyāsa in
<div n="lb"/>No. 28; as Dvaipāyana in No. 29 and as Vedavyāsa in No. 44.
<div n="lb"/>In No. 43, there is a reference to his saying in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata.<sup>74</sup> In No. 52 he is described as the compiler of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and as a son of Parāśara.<sup>75</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally Vyāsa means ‘division or extension’ and as the
<div n="lb"/>name of a person it signifies an arranger, compiler or narrator.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa is said to have rearranged the Vedas into four parts,
<div n="lb"/>and taught each of them to four respective pupils — Paila,
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśaṃpāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu; he also rearranged
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsa — Purāṇas and composed the Bhārata and the Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata.<sup>76</sup> Subsequently, the name Vyāsa came to be applied to
<div n="lb"/>any great typical compiler or author.<sup>77</sup> He was the son of the
<div n="lb"/>sage Parāśara and was brought forth by his mother Satyavatī
<div n="lb"/>on an island in the river Yamunā. Hence he is also known
<div n="lb"/>as Dvaipāyana and Bādarāyaṇa.<sup>78</sup> As he was called Kṛṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>Dvaipāyana, it seems that Vyāsa, Dvaipāyana, and Bādarāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>were epithets; his original name might have been Kṛṣṇa due to
<div n="lb"/>his dark complexion,<sup>79</sup> and he was called ‘Dvaipāyana for
<div n="lb"/>being born on an island ({%dvīpa%}).’
