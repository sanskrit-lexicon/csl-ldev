8. {%Vyāsa%}¦ (No. 28, L. 21; No. 29, L. 14; No. 36, L. 15; No.
43, L. 30; No. 44, L. 21; No. 52, LL. 11-12):
Vyāsa has been mentioned as Bhagavān (venerable) Vyāsa in
No. 28; as Dvaipāyana in No. 29 and as Vedavyāsa in No. 44.
In No. 43, there is a reference to his saying in the Mahā-
bhārata.<sup>74</sup> In No. 52 he is described as the compiler of the
Vedas and as a son of Parāśara.<sup>75</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally Vyāsa means ‘division or extension’ and as the
name of a person it signifies an arranger, compiler or narrator.
Vyāsa is said to have rearranged the Vedas into four parts,
and taught each of them to four respective pupils — Paila,
Vaiśaṃpāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu; he also rearranged
Itihāsa — Purāṇas and composed the Bhārata and the Bhāga-
vata.<sup>76</sup> Subsequently, the name Vyāsa came to be applied to
any great typical compiler or author.<sup>77</sup> He was the son of the
sage Parāśara and was brought forth by his mother Satyavatī
on an island in the river Yamunā. Hence he is also known
as Dvaipāyana and Bādarāyaṇa.<sup>78</sup> As he was called Kṛṣṇa-
Dvaipāyana, it seems that Vyāsa, Dvaipāyana, and Bādarāyaṇa
were epithets; his original name might have been Kṛṣṇa due to
his dark complexion,<sup>79</sup> and he was called ‘Dvaipāyana for
being born on an island ({%dvīpa%}).’
