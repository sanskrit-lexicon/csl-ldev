10. {%Sudarśana%}¦ (No. 14, L. 15: L. 17):
<div n="lb"/>It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from
<div n="lb"/>Girinagara as mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Rudradāman I (A.D. 150).<sup>64</sup> The lake was originally cons-
<div n="lb"/>tructed by the Vaiśya Puṣyagupta, the provincial governor of
<div n="lb"/>the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of
<div n="lb"/>Aśoka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣāspha.<sup>65</sup> The same lake was destroyed by the excessive
<div n="lb"/>floods in the Suvarṇasikatā, Palāśinī and other streams arising
<div n="lb"/>from the mountain Ūrjayat.<sup>66</sup> By a breach, four hundred and
<div n="lb"/>twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five
<div n="lb"/>cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost
<div n="lb"/>like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.<sup>67</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>lake was immediately beautified with repairs by king Rudradā-
<div n="lb"/>man.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of
<div n="lb"/>Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy
<div n="lb"/>continuous rains the Sudarśana lake burst out on all sides<sup>69</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the
<div n="lb"/>literal meaning of its name the Sudarśana became ugly to look
<div n="lb"/>at.<sup>70</sup> The lake was repaired in the year 137 (G. E.)<sup>71</sup> (= A.D.
<div n="lb"/>456) by Cakrapālita, who was appointed governor of Giri-
<div n="lb"/>nagara by his father Parṇadatta, who was Skandagupta's
<div n="lb"/>viceroy in Surāṣṭra.<sup>72</sup>
