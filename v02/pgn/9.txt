9. {%Pūrugupta%}¦ (No. 47, L. 6; No. 53, L. 6; No. 49, L. 6;
No. 50, L. 6; No. 38, L. 1):
We know from No. 53 that {%Mahārājādhirāja%} Śrī Pūrugupta
was the son of {%Mahārājādhirāja%} Śrī Kumāragupta by his chief
queen Anantadevī. In No. 38, L. 1 the name of the father
[Page-025+ 39]
and predecessor of Narasiṃhagupta is spelt as Pūrugupta.<sup>89</sup>
The reading Pūrugupta is unmistakeable on the fragmentary
Nālandā Seal of Narasiṃhagupta and is also fairly clear
on the seals of Kumāragupta II. The medial {%ū%} sign in
the first letter of the name Pūrugupta is indicated by an
additional stroke attached to the base of the letter and the
downward elongation of its right limb; mere elongation of the
right limb by itself would have denoted the short medial {%u%} as
in {%puttras%} in LL. 2 and 3. In the second letter of the name,
viz. {%ru.%} the medial {%u%} is shown by a small hook turned to left
and joined to the foot of {%r.%} Palaeographical considerations
apart, the name Pur{%u%}gupta yields a more plausible-sense than
Pur{%a%}gupta and fits better in the series of the grand and digni-
fied names of the Gupta kings. The first part of the Gupta
names constituted the real or substantive name and yielded
satisfactory meaning independently of the latter half, viz.
{%gupta,%} which being family surname was a mere adjunct. {%Pura,%}
by itself is neither a complete nor a dignified name while {%Puru%}
is both. {%Pūru%} or its variant {%Puru%} may, like {%Vainya%} in Vainya-
gupta signify the homonymous epic hero of the lunar race
who was the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, or
may mean abundant or great.<sup>90</sup>
