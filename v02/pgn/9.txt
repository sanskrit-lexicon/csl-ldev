9. {%Pūrugupta%}¦ (No. 47, L. 6; No. 53, L. 6; No. 49, L. 6;
<div n="lb"/>No. 50, L. 6; No. 38, L. 1):
<div n="lb"/>We know from No. 53 that {%Mahārājādhirāja%} Śrī Pūrugupta
<div n="lb"/>was the son of {%Mahārājādhirāja%} Śrī Kumāragupta by his chief
<div n="lb"/>queen Anantadevī. In No. 38, L. 1 the name of the father
[Page-025+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>and predecessor of Narasiṃhagupta is spelt as Pūrugupta.<sup>89</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The reading Pūrugupta is unmistakeable on the fragmentary
<div n="lb"/>Nālandā Seal of Narasiṃhagupta and is also fairly clear
<div n="lb"/>on the seals of Kumāragupta II. The medial {%ū%} sign in
<div n="lb"/>the first letter of the name Pūrugupta is indicated by an
<div n="lb"/>additional stroke attached to the base of the letter and the
<div n="lb"/>downward elongation of its right limb; mere elongation of the
<div n="lb"/>right limb by itself would have denoted the short medial {%u%} as
<div n="lb"/>in {%puttras%} in LL. 2 and 3. In the second letter of the name,
<div n="lb"/>viz. {%ru.%} the medial {%u%} is shown by a small hook turned to left
<div n="lb"/>and joined to the foot of {%r.%} Palaeographical considerations
<div n="lb"/>apart, the name Pur{%u%}gupta yields a more plausible-sense than
<div n="lb"/>Pur{%a%}gupta and fits better in the series of the grand and digni-
<div n="lb"/>fied names of the Gupta kings. The first part of the Gupta
<div n="lb"/>names constituted the real or substantive name and yielded
<div n="lb"/>satisfactory meaning independently of the latter half, viz.
<div n="lb"/>{%gupta,%} which being family surname was a mere adjunct. {%Pura,%}
<div n="lb"/>by itself is neither a complete nor a dignified name while {%Puru%}
<div n="lb"/>is both. {%Pūru%} or its variant {%Puru%} may, like {%Vainya%} in Vainya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta signify the homonymous epic hero of the lunar race
<div n="lb"/>who was the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, or
<div n="lb"/>may mean abundant or great.<sup>90</sup>
