3. {%Cirātadatta%}¦ (No. 34, L. 2, L. 3):
The first part Cirāta can be a Prakritization of the word Kirāta
which is the name of Śiva (the god Śiva in the form of a wild
mountaineer or Kirāta as opposed to Arjuna).<sup>73</sup> Hence the
complete expression would literally mean ‘begotton by the
grace of Kirāta’.
