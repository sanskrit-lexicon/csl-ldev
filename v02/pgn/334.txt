21. {%Sanakānīka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short {%‘i’%} in the fourth
<div n="lb"/>syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanakānika’.<sup>516</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanakānīkas were also subjugated by Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes,
<div n="lb"/>obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.<sup>517</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the
<div n="lb"/>Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Mahārāja of the
<div n="lb"/>‘Sanakānīka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vaiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṇava Cave temple at Udayagiri.<sup>518</sup> Udayagiri is a well-known
<div n="lb"/>hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient
<div n="lb"/>Vidiśā.<sup>519</sup> Thus we can say that the Sanakānīkas lived in the
<div n="lb"/>neighbourhood of Bhilsa.<sup>520</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them
<div n="lb"/>to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇa-
<div n="lb"/>patināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta) in Vidiśā.<sup>521</sup> So his view seems to be inconsistent.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the
<div n="lb"/>title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and
<div n="lb"/>probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is
<div n="lb"/>generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.<sup>522</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory
<div n="lb"/>chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks
<div n="lb"/>like a foreign name’;<sup>523</sup> but his father bears a purely Hindu
<div n="lb"/>name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is
<div n="lb"/>illegible in the inscription (No. 3).<sup>524</sup> But considering the trend
[Page-167+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.<sup>525</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal
<div n="lb"/>people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>culture.
