21. {%Sanakānīka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2):
In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short {%‘i’%} in the fourth
syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanakānika’.<sup>516</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanakānīkas were also subjugated by Samudragupta
along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes,
obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.<sup>517</sup>
In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the
Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Mahārāja of the
‘Sanakānīka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candra-
gupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vaiṣ-
ṇava Cave temple at Udayagiri.<sup>518</sup> Udayagiri is a well-known
hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient
Vidiśā.<sup>519</sup> Thus we can say that the Sanakānīkas lived in the
neighbourhood of Bhilsa.<sup>520</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them
to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇa-
patināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudra-
gupta) in Vidiśā.<sup>521</sup> So his view seems to be inconsistent.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of
Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the
title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and
probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is
generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.<sup>522</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory
chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks
like a foreign name’;<sup>523</sup> but his father bears a purely Hindu
name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is
illegible in the inscription (No. 3).<sup>524</sup> But considering the trend
[Page-167+ 39]
it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.<sup>525</sup>
It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal
people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit
culture.
