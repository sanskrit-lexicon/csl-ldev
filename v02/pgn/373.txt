(8) {%Pāṭaliputra%}¦ (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14):
It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the
river Gaṅgā. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pāṭaliputra. Inscrip-
tion No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister
for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the mean-
ings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind,
who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭali-
putra.<sup>290</sup> Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa
where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.<sup>291</sup>
Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the
word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock
edicts.<sup>292</sup> The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the
abundance of flowers.<sup>293</sup> Its name Puṣpapura is also met with
in the Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>294</sup> It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa
as well.<sup>295</sup> The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva<sup>296</sup> (11th century)
describes it as a place of both wealth and education though
generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.<sup>297</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a
tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahma-
sabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa,
Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candra-
gupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of gram-
mar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and
Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.<sup>298</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa<sup>299</sup> (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭali-
putra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his
learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy
with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda
[Page-231+ 39]
at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there
will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surroun-
ded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was
a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind
and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by
name”.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāśikā<sup>301</sup> records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra:
<div n="P"/>1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā)
<div n="P"/>2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa)
<div n="P"/>Patañjali<sup>302</sup> mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen
of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.<sup>303</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Am-
bassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta
Maurya.<sup>304</sup> The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name
Śrīnagara.<sup>305</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to
explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote
the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the
mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala
putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.<sup>306</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of
Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and
Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnag-
ara’ means ‘a beautiful city.<sup>307</sup> Because of the abundance of
flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by
other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.<sup>308</sup>
According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura
(K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kus-
uma) in the royal enclosure.<sup>309</sup> Later its glory was replaced by
that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.<sup>310</sup>
<div n="P"/>The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary
origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a
brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked
to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went
out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad.
When asked, he told that his life was waning without any
company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under
which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words
he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower
[Page-232+ 39]
(Bignonia Suaveloens).<sup>311</sup> As the Sun was about to set, all
the students proposed to return home but the young student
fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next
day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple.
After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay
there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the
old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him
and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusuma-
pura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie
built the mansion for the youth the country was named as
Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was
Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped.
<div n="P"/>The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was
originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said
to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licc-
havis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his
way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village
on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village
was destined to become a great city.<sup>313</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭali-
putra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva.
It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to
Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)<sup>314</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious
political and cultural activities right from the fifth century
B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.<sup>315</sup> It had the
honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the
Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas until the Hūṇa inva-
sion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana
(7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.<sup>316</sup> Śaśāṅka
Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monas-
teries at Pāṭaliputra.<sup>317</sup> Dharmapāla, the most powerful of
the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.<sup>318</sup>
<div n="P"/>Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted
for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about
A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort
there. It then came into importance under its modern name
Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now
[Page-233+ 36]
the capital of Bihar.<sup>319</sup>
