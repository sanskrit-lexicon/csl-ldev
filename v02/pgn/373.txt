(8) {%Pāṭaliputra%}¦ (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14):
<div n="lb"/>It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pāṭaliputra. Inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tion No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister
<div n="lb"/>for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the mean-
<div n="lb"/>ings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind,
<div n="lb"/>who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭali-
<div n="lb"/>putra.<sup>290</sup> Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa
<div n="lb"/>where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.<sup>291</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the
<div n="lb"/>word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock
<div n="lb"/>edicts.<sup>292</sup> The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the
<div n="lb"/>abundance of flowers.<sup>293</sup> Its name Puṣpapura is also met with
<div n="lb"/>in the Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>294</sup> It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>as well.<sup>295</sup> The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva<sup>296</sup> (11th century)
<div n="lb"/>describes it as a place of both wealth and education though
<div n="lb"/>generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.<sup>297</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a
<div n="lb"/>tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahma-
<div n="lb"/>sabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa,
<div n="lb"/>Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of gram-
<div n="lb"/>mar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and
<div n="lb"/>Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.<sup>298</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa<sup>299</sup> (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭali-
<div n="lb"/>putra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his
<div n="lb"/>learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy
<div n="lb"/>with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda
[Page-231+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there
<div n="lb"/>will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surroun-
<div n="lb"/>ded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was
<div n="lb"/>a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind
<div n="lb"/>and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by
<div n="lb"/>name”.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāśikā<sup>301</sup> records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra:
<div n="P"/>1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā)
<div n="P"/>2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa)
<div n="P"/>Patañjali<sup>302</sup> mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen
<div n="lb"/>of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.<sup>303</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Am-
<div n="lb"/>bassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>Maurya.<sup>304</sup> The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name
<div n="lb"/>Śrīnagara.<sup>305</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to
<div n="lb"/>explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote
<div n="lb"/>the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the
<div n="lb"/>mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala
<div n="lb"/>putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.<sup>306</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and
<div n="lb"/>Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnag-
<div n="lb"/>ara’ means ‘a beautiful city.<sup>307</sup> Because of the abundance of
<div n="lb"/>flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by
<div n="lb"/>other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.<sup>308</sup>
<div n="lb"/>According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura
<div n="lb"/>(K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kus-
<div n="lb"/>uma) in the royal enclosure.<sup>309</sup> Later its glory was replaced by
<div n="lb"/>that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.<sup>310</sup>
<div n="P"/>The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary
<div n="lb"/>origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked
<div n="lb"/>to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went
<div n="lb"/>out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad.
<div n="lb"/>When asked, he told that his life was waning without any
<div n="lb"/>company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under
<div n="lb"/>which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words
<div n="lb"/>he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower
[Page-232+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>(Bignonia Suaveloens).<sup>311</sup> As the Sun was about to set, all
<div n="lb"/>the students proposed to return home but the young student
<div n="lb"/>fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next
<div n="lb"/>day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple.
<div n="lb"/>After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay
<div n="lb"/>there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the
<div n="lb"/>old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him
<div n="lb"/>and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusuma-
<div n="lb"/>pura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie
<div n="lb"/>built the mansion for the youth the country was named as
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped.
<div n="P"/>The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was
<div n="lb"/>originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said
<div n="lb"/>to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licc-
<div n="lb"/>havis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his
<div n="lb"/>way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village
<div n="lb"/>on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village
<div n="lb"/>was destined to become a great city.<sup>313</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭali-
<div n="lb"/>putra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva.
<div n="lb"/>It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)<sup>314</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious
<div n="lb"/>political and cultural activities right from the fifth century
<div n="lb"/>B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.<sup>315</sup> It had the
<div n="lb"/>honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the
<div n="lb"/>Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas until the Hūṇa inva-
<div n="lb"/>sion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana
<div n="lb"/>(7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.<sup>316</sup> Śaśāṅka
<div n="lb"/>Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monas-
<div n="lb"/>teries at Pāṭaliputra.<sup>317</sup> Dharmapāla, the most powerful of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.<sup>318</sup>
<div n="P"/>Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted
<div n="lb"/>for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort
<div n="lb"/>there. It then came into importance under its modern name
<div n="lb"/>Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now
[Page-233+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>the capital of Bihar.<sup>319</sup>
