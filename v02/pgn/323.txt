10. {%Licchavis%}¦ (No. 1, L. 29; No. 4, L. 7; No. 10, L. 4; No. 12,
<div n="lb"/>L. 18; No. 13, L. 3: No. 21, L. 5; No. 40, L. 4; No. 47,

<div n="lb"/>The epithet ‘Licchavi-dauhitra’ (daughter's son of the Licchavi)
<div n="lb"/>for Samudragupta occurs in all these Gupta records It
<div n="lb"/>suggests the importance of Candragupta I's marriage with the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi princess Kumāradevī. The alliance had no social
<div n="lb"/>importance but it was important for political gain by virtue
<div n="lb"/>of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained power-
<div n="lb"/>ful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In
<div n="lb"/>the Candragupta-Kumāradevī-coins, we have no mention of
<div n="lb"/>the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural {%‘Licchavayaḥ’%}
<div n="lb"/>(the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the
<div n="lb"/>Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar
<div n="lb"/>that ‘the epithet {%Licchavi dauhitra%} was deliberately given to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual
<div n="lb"/>monarchy’.<sup>195</sup>
<div n="P"/>We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal<sup>196</sup> but
<div n="lb"/>the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta<sup>197</sup> proves that it
<div n="lb"/>was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of
[Page-139+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Kumāradevī may be located in North Bihar with Vaiśālī
<div n="lb"/>(modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.<sup>198</sup> It was
<div n="lb"/>a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśālī had been the rivals of the kings of Pāṭaliputra<sup>199</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>that they did not marry outside their area.<sup>200</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of this powerful people has come to us in many
<div n="lb"/>different readings:
<div n="P"/>Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi,
<div n="P"/>Lichikki and Lichavi.
<div n="P"/>Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in
<div n="lb"/>literature.<sup>201</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of this people is in Kauṭilya's Artha-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra,<sup>202</sup> where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that
<div n="lb"/>the corporations of Licchivi, Vṛji, Malla, Madra, Kakura,
<div n="lb"/>Kuru, Pañcāla and others were {%‘rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ’.%} It is note-
<div n="lb"/>worthy that Kauṭilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vṛjis
<div n="lb"/>though some scholars consider them to be one.<sup>203</sup> H. Pandey<sup>204</sup>
<div n="lb"/>says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji
<div n="lb"/>and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the
<div n="lb"/>accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion.
<div n="lb"/>Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vaiśālī where ‘Licchavis’
<div n="lb"/>were the people of the country. He does not mention Vṛji or
<div n="lb"/>Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vaiśālī and Vṛji as two distinct
<div n="lb"/>countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his
<div n="lb"/>description of the Vṛji country.<sup>205</sup> But we know that Vajji was
<div n="lb"/>a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis, Jñātrikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the cons-
<div n="lb"/>tituent confederate clans (aṭṭhakula). Of these the Licchavis and
<div n="lb"/>the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśālī was the head-quarter of the confederacy.<sup>206</sup> But Ray
<div n="lb"/>Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the
<div n="lb"/>confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the
<div n="lb"/>Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the
<div n="lb"/>city of Vaiśālī which was not only the capital of the Licchavi
<div n="lb"/>clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.<sup>207</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi republic was generally called the saṃgha or gaṇa of
<div n="lb"/>the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this
<div n="lb"/>name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage,
[Page-140+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the Licchavi Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis
<div n="lb"/>who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is
<div n="lb"/>represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become
<div n="lb"/>Vajjians, they will become Vajjians ({%bhavissanti Vajji bhavis-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%santi Vajji)%}”! This possibly only means that there was great
<div n="lb"/>hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians,
<div n="lb"/>practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the
<div n="lb"/>Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and lead-
<div n="lb"/>ing a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more
<div n="lb"/>dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe
<div n="lb"/>which inhabited what is known as {%Vajjiraṭṭha (Vṛji-rāṣṭra),%} i. e.,
<div n="lb"/>the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation
<div n="lb"/>seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis,
<div n="lb"/>because the Arthaśāstra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and
<div n="lb"/>the Vṛjika as two distinct republics.<sup>208</sup>
<div n="P"/>The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the
<div n="lb"/>annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghoṣa, the celebrated Pali
<div n="lb"/>commentator has the following story<sup>209</sup>: The chief queen of
<div n="lb"/>the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered
<div n="lb"/>lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Jīvaka
<div n="lb"/>flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear
<div n="lb"/>of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket
<div n="lb"/>marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and
<div n="lb"/>taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of
<div n="lb"/>flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into
<div n="lb"/>two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally
<div n="lb"/>one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a
<div n="lb"/>girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked
<div n="lb"/>as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone {%(maṇi)%}
<div n="lb"/>so that they seemed to have no skin {%(Nicchavi).%} Others said: ‘the
<div n="lb"/>two were attached to each other by their skin {%(līna-chavi)%} as if
<div n="lb"/>they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be
<div n="lb"/>designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of
<div n="lb"/>age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from
<div n="lb"/>this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis<sup>210</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great
<div n="lb"/>controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolari-
<div n="lb"/>ans, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.<sup>211</sup>
[Page-141+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Samuel Beal<sup>212</sup> takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a
<div n="lb"/>branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India
<div n="lb"/>in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly
<div n="lb"/>civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C.
<div n="P"/>In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong
<div n="lb"/>indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest
<div n="lb"/>settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived
<div n="lb"/>there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and Āryans”.
<div n="lb"/>The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian
<div n="lb"/>Āryan dynasty of rulers at Vaiśālī.<sup>213</sup>
<div n="P"/>V.A. Smith<sup>214</sup> found similarities between the customs of
<div n="lb"/>the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the
<div n="lb"/>exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And
<div n="lb"/>hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the
<div n="lb"/>ruling tribe or clan in Vṛji country of which Vaiśālī was the
<div n="lb"/>capital, was really a Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled
<div n="lb"/>in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been
<div n="lb"/>criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri
<div n="lb"/>and others on the following grounds<sup>215</sup>:
<div n="HI"/>(1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent
<div n="lb"/>among the Vedic Āryans from whom the Licchavis
<div n="lb"/>were descended;
<div n="HI"/>(2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as
<div n="lb"/>against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further
<div n="lb"/>we know very little about the relative antiquity of the
<div n="lb"/>Tibetan procedure which might very well have been
<div n="lb"/>suggested by the system expounded in the Aṭṭhakathā.
<div n="P"/>S.C. Vidyābhūṣaṇa<sup>216</sup> suggests a Persian origin for the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi ({%Nicchavi%} of Manu,
<div n="lb"/>X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of {%Nisibis.%} There
<div n="lb"/>is very little in Vidyābhūṣaṇa's surmise except a fancied
<div n="lb"/>resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settle-
<div n="lb"/>ment in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi people were more interested in {%Yakṣa caityas%} and the
<div n="lb"/>teaching of Mahāvīra and the Buddha than in the deities and
<div n="lb"/>Prophets of Iran.<sup>217</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Licchavis have been invariably represented as kṣatriyas
<div n="lb"/>in ancient Indian literature. As the Mahāparinibbāṇa-Sutta
[Page-142+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the
<div n="lb"/>Buddha's body on the ground that they were kṣatriyas like the
<div n="lb"/>Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a kṣatriya and so are
<div n="lb"/>we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted
<div n="lb"/>one”. We get many other similar instances.<sup>218</sup> We find that
<div n="lb"/>both the Śākyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister
<div n="lb"/>unions. Like the Śākyas, the Licchavis are also described as
<div n="lb"/>kṣatriyas.<sup>219</sup> Manu speaks of the Licchavis as kṣatriyas, though
<div n="lb"/>of the Vrātya variety.<sup>220</sup> Regarding the Vrātyas, Manu says:
<div n="lb"/>‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal
<div n="lb"/>caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded
<div n="lb"/>from the initiation to {%Sāvitrī,%} one must designate by the appel-
<div n="lb"/>lation vrātyas’.<sup>221</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, was the
<div n="lb"/>very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers
<div n="lb"/>among the residents of Vaiśālī, even among the highest officers.
<div n="lb"/>Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the
<div n="lb"/>earliest estimated date of the Manusmṛti,<sup>222</sup> the Licchavis had
<div n="lb"/>won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers
<div n="lb"/>of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the
<div n="lb"/>two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and
<div n="lb"/>practices that the regulations of the orthodox brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as
<div n="lb"/>Vrātyas’.<sup>223</sup> But Gokhale<sup>224</sup> takes the term kṣatriya in this
<div n="lb"/>context to mean representative of political power rather than
<div n="lb"/>a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word
<div n="lb"/>{%Vrātya%} infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical
<div n="lb"/>civilization.
<div n="P"/>Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the
<div n="lb"/>word ‘Vrātya’.<sup>225</sup> Charpentier described the Vrātyas, as a band
<div n="lb"/>of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably repre-
<div n="lb"/>senting the worst elements of Indian society, — the thief, the
<div n="lb"/>robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by
<div n="lb"/>pointing out that Manu's reference to the {%Rājanya Vrātyas,%}
<div n="lb"/>e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic
<div n="lb"/>times.<sup>226</sup> Haver in his article ‘Der Vrātya’ derives ‘Vrātya’
[Page-143+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>from {%‘vrata’.%} Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vrāta’ is a group of
<div n="lb"/>people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cult-
<div n="lb"/>actions being derived from {%‘vrata’%} which is a vow taken in the
<div n="lb"/>service of a god. The {%Vrātīnas,%} on the other hand, ‘were
<div n="lb"/>Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the
<div n="lb"/>orthodox brāhmaṇas, and were organised in cult-unions and
<div n="lb"/>both {%‘vrātya’%} and {%‘vrātīna’%} being derived from {%‘vrata’%} are
<div n="lb"/>‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between
<div n="lb"/>them apparently was that the Vrātīna went to the brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>countries to perform the Vrātya-work and were paid for it,
<div n="lb"/>while the Vrātyas acted in their own homeland.<sup>227</sup>
<div n="P"/>From all these considerations, we can see that the views of
<div n="lb"/>Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In
<div n="lb"/>the Nepāla Vaṃśāvalī, the Licchavis are allotted to the Sūrya-
<div n="lb"/>vaṃśa or solar race of the kṣatriyas.<sup>228</sup> This is quite in agree-
<div n="lb"/>ment with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they
<div n="lb"/>were Vāsiṣṭhas by {%Gotra,%} for we know from the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>229</sup> that the {%gotra%} or {%pravara%} (family) of a kṣatriya is
<div n="lb"/>the same as that of his {%purohita%} or family-priest. The Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>{%gotra%} was, therefore, the {%gotra%} of their family priest, and we
<div n="lb"/>know that the Vasiṣṭhas were the family priests of the kings of
<div n="lb"/>the solar race, especially of the Ikṣvākus.<sup>230</sup>
