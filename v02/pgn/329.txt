16. {%Puṣyamitras%}¦ (No. 13, L. 11):
<div n="lb"/>The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription<sup>397</sup> records Skandagupta's
<div n="lb"/>victory over a powerful enemy called the Puṣyamitras, who
<div n="lb"/>possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta)
<div n="lb"/>placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of
<div n="lb"/>that tribe himself).<sup>398</sup> H.R. Divekar suggested the reading
<div n="lb"/>{%Yudhy-amitrān%} in place of {%Puṣyamitrān.%} But, as pointed out by
<div n="lb"/>R.D. Banerji,<sup>399</sup> the proposed reading is impossible.
<div n="P"/>There are several views about the identification of the
<div n="lb"/>Puṣyamitras.
<div n="HI"/>(i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas as {%Paṭumitras%} and located them on the
<div n="lb"/>Narmadā.<sup>400</sup>
<div n="HI"/>(ii) V.A. Smith<sup>401</sup> regarded them as a people of the North.
<div n="HI"/>(iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the
<div n="lb"/>{%Maitrakas.%}<sup>402</sup>
<div n="HI"/>(iv) R.D. Banerji<sup>403</sup> regarded them as the first wave of the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas.
<div n="HI"/>(v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras
<div n="lb"/>were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.<sup>404</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the
<div n="lb"/>descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been
<div n="lb"/>{%mitras%} or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by
<div n="lb"/>their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from
<div n="lb"/>the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar,
<div n="lb"/>“there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support,
<div n="lb"/>for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.<sup>405</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns
<div n="lb"/>to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on
<div n="lb"/>the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta.
[Page-156+ 39]
<div n="P"/>We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign
<div n="lb"/>are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of
<div n="lb"/>Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because
<div n="lb"/>we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter
<div n="lb"/>of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be
<div n="lb"/>settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough
<div n="lb"/>calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans
<div n="lb"/>of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.<sup>406</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by
<div n="lb"/>R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in
<div n="lb"/>the Bhitari Inscription.<sup>407</sup> “By whose (Skandagupta's) two
<div n="lb"/>arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a distur-
<div n="lb"/>bance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict
<div n="lb"/>with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the
<div n="lb"/>same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership
<div n="lb"/>of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with
<div n="lb"/>the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;<sup>408</sup> is also not accept-
<div n="lb"/>able as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial
<div n="lb"/>Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṃha.<sup>409</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled
<div n="lb"/>against Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose
<div n="lb"/>rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the {%Vindhyakas.%}
<div n="lb"/>In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have
<div n="lb"/>the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras
<div n="lb"/>and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.<sup>410</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most
<div n="lb"/>correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and
<div n="lb"/>Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Nar-
<div n="lb"/>madā”.<sup>411</sup>
<div n="P"/>A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are
<div n="lb"/>grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not
<div n="lb"/>been named.<sup>412</sup>
<div n="P"/>The mention of {%Vindhyakas,%} evidently a people of the
<div n="lb"/>Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than
<div n="lb"/>to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were
<div n="lb"/>a people of the North is not acceptable.
[Page-157+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed
<div n="lb"/>in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.<sup>413</sup> This is supported
<div n="lb"/>by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by
<div n="lb"/>D.B. Diskalkar,<sup>414</sup> from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to
<div n="lb"/>the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious
<div n="lb"/>disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising
<div n="lb"/>of the Puṣyamitras in that region.<sup>415</sup>
