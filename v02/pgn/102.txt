1. {%Śāmbapāla%}¦ (No. 34, LL. 5-6; No. 35, L. 5):
[Page-058+ 38]
The first part of the name Śāmba is to be derived from {%Sāmba%}
which literally means accompanied by Ambā (Durgā) and is
the name of Lord Śiva.<sup>12</sup> It has been the name of a son of
Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavatī as well as of several authors and teachers.<sup>13</sup>
{%Pāla%} is a name-ending suffix having the least significance in the
present case. Perhaps it has been added only to honour the
Gṛhyasūtra injunction of not giving names of deities directly
to human-beings.<sup>14</sup>
