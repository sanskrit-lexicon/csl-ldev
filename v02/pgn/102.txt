1. {%Śāmbapāla%}¦ (No. 34, LL. 5-6; No. 35, L. 5):
[Page-058+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>The first part of the name Śāmba is to be derived from {%Sāmba%}
<div n="lb"/>which literally means accompanied by Ambā (Durgā) and is
<div n="lb"/>the name of Lord Śiva.<sup>12</sup> It has been the name of a son of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavatī as well as of several authors and teachers.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%Pāla%} is a name-ending suffix having the least significance in the
<div n="lb"/>present case. Perhaps it has been added only to honour the
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhyasūtra injunction of not giving names of deities directly
<div n="lb"/>to human-beings.<sup>14</sup>
