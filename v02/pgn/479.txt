12. {%Vilāsinī<sup>75</sup>%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
The river comes out from the mountain Raivataka. Fleet
takes Sikatāvilāsinī as an adjective of the Palāśinī<sup>76</sup> but the
three, Sikatā, Vilāsinī and Palāśinī seem to be separate rivers
as we find the use of the plural number in the case which
[Page-298+ 38]
denotes the mention of more than two rivers. Hence Vilāsinī
is the third river in the context: the other two being Pilāśinī
and Sikatā (Suvarṇasikatā).
