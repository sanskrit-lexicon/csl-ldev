<div n="lb"/>L. 7; No. 38, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>Narasiṃhagupta has been mentioned as {%‘Paramabhāgavata’%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%‘Mahārājādhirāja’.%} Hiranand Shastri<sup>102</sup> says that the seal of
<div n="lb"/>Narasiṃhagupta (No. 47), though not entire is valuable in
<div n="lb"/>establishing his identity as the son of Pūrugupta born of the
<div n="lb"/>the queen consort Śrī Vainyadevī and not Vatsadevī as has
<div n="lb"/>hitherto been believed. But the correct reading of the name of
<div n="lb"/>her mother is Śrī Candradevī, on his seal.<sup>103</sup> In No. 50. L. 6
<div n="lb"/>we find his mother's name as ‘Vatsadevī’. In No. 49 he is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as the father of Kumāragupta III. No. 38 describes
<div n="lb"/>the issuer of this seal, Viṣṇugupta, as the son and successor of
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta III, who in his turn was the son and successor
[Page-027+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>of Narasiṃhagupta.
<div n="P"/>Narasiṃha is the name of Viṣṇu in his fourth incarnation
<div n="lb"/>(Avatāra), half man and half lion who slew the demon Hiraṇya-
<div n="lb"/>kaśipu and saved the life of Prahlāda.<sup>104</sup>
