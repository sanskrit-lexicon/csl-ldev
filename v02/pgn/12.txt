12. {%Narasiṃhagupta:%}¦ (No. 47, L. 8; No. 49, L. 7; No. 50,
L. 7; No. 38, L. 2):
Narasiṃhagupta has been mentioned as {%‘Paramabhāgavata’%} and
{%‘Mahārājādhirāja’.%} Hiranand Shastri<sup>102</sup> says that the seal of
Narasiṃhagupta (No. 47), though not entire is valuable in
establishing his identity as the son of Pūrugupta born of the
the queen consort Śrī Vainyadevī and not Vatsadevī as has
hitherto been believed. But the correct reading of the name of
her mother is Śrī Candradevī, on his seal.<sup>103</sup> In No. 50. L. 6
we find his mother's name as ‘Vatsadevī’. In No. 49 he is
mentioned as the father of Kumāragupta III. No. 38 describes
the issuer of this seal, Viṣṇugupta, as the son and successor of
Kumāragupta III, who in his turn was the son and successor
[Page-027+ 38]
of Narasiṃhagupta.
<div n="P"/>Narasiṃha is the name of Viṣṇu in his fourth incarnation
(Avatāra), half man and half lion who slew the demon Hiraṇya-
kaśipu and saved the life of Prahlāda.<sup>104</sup>
