10. {%Rāmaka%}¦ (No. 29, L. 5):
It is also an abbreviated name possibly from Rāma-datta (Cf.
Pāṇini V. 3. 82) with the addition of the suffix {%‘ka’.%} In the Agni
Purāṇa it is the name of Rāma Rāghava.<sup>61</sup> It is formed from
[Page-065+ 38]
§ ram and means delighting, gratifying.<sup>62</sup> According to lexico-
graphers a Rāmaka is a Māgadha who lives as a messenger.<sup>63</sup>
But here it is a personal name based on the Epic hero Lord
Rāma.
