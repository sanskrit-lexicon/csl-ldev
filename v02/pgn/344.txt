1. {%Gayā%}¦ (No. 21, L. 7):
<div n="P"/>A village named Revatikā belonging to the Gayā viṣaya
was granted as an agrahāra to a brāhmaṇa, ostensibly by
Samudragupta.<sup>75</sup> Gayā is at present headquarters of the
Gayā district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the
modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the
ancient town of Gayā on the southern side.<sup>76</sup> Much has been
written on Gayā,<sup>77</sup> all of which is not possible to discuss
here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gayā
and the importance of Gayā.
<div n="P"/>In the Ṛgveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a com-
poser of hymns.<sup>78</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>79</sup> Gaya appears to be a
[Page-215+ 39]
wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa who
later on transformed himself into Gayāsura.<sup>80</sup> According to
the Vāyu Purāṇa,<sup>81</sup> the city was named Gaya after an Asura,
Gaya by name (Gayāsura). Viṣṇu killed this demon but
granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred.
According to R.L. Mitra,<sup>82</sup> this story is an allegorical repre-
sentation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gayā which
was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurṇavābha in ex-
plaining ‘idam Viṣṇur-vī Cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam’<sup>83</sup>
in the Nirukta<sup>84</sup> holds that the three steps of Viṣṇu were placed
on Samārohaṇa, Viṣṇupada and Gayaśiras. The Māhabhārata
(III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by
Gaya<sup>85</sup> references to which<sup>86</sup> are also found in the Rāmā-
yaṇa,<sup>87</sup> Bhāgavata Purāṇa<sup>88</sup> Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,<sup>89</sup> Agni
Purāṇa,<sup>90</sup> Viṣṇu Purāṇa,<sup>91</sup> Vāmana Purāṇa,<sup>92</sup> etc. Aśvaghoṣa's
Buddhacarita<sup>93</sup> (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's
visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’,
who was later conceived as a great giant.<sup>94</sup>
<div n="P"/>We can find evidence of the importance of Gayā growing
in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gayā while we have
only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get
numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pāla period.<sup>95</sup> But
these records are of not much use for the history of the town,
they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D.
it was under the Pālas.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city played no major role in polities at any period of
history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of
Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.<sup>97</sup> Gayā which was the
headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between
the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by
A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a
thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.<sup>98</sup>
<div n="P"/>The religious importance of Gayā is met with in the Māhā-
bhārata,<sup>99</sup> Rāmāyaṇa<sup>100</sup> and Purāṇas.<sup>101</sup> The Gayā has a
special religious importance with reference to the Śrāddha cere-
mony.<sup>102</sup>
