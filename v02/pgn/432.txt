8. {%Nakhaddārccarika-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 23):
The expression means the field of Nakhaddārccarika. The word
Nakhaddārccarika is a puzzle but it can be possibly explained
as the worshipper of Nakṣatras, i. e. an astronomer.<sup>509</sup> Nakṣa-
tra changes to nakkhatta<sup>510</sup> in Prakrit. Nakha and ṇakkha are
identical,<sup>511</sup> tta in nakkhatta changes to dda in sandhi here. The
word ‘arccarika’ means a ‘worshipper’.<sup>512</sup> Stars were regarded
as deities to whom regular worship (bhakti) was shown. The
names based on stars were unknown in Vedic literature but
became popular in the time of Pāṇini and later.<sup>513</sup>
