4. {%Samudragupta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 29; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53,

<div n="lb"/>He is introduced as {%Mahārājādhirāja%} in all references except
<div n="lb"/>the Mathurā Pillar Inscription of Candragupta II, G.E. 61<sup>57</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where he is mentioned as {%Bhaṭṭārakamahārāja rājādhirāja.%} He
<div n="lb"/>was the daughter's son of the Licchavis, and son of {%Mahārājā-%}
[Page-022+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>{%dhirāja%} Śrī Candragupta I born on the queen Kumāradevī.<sup>58</sup>
<div n="lb"/>He has been mentioned as a {%‘Paramabhāgavata’%} (a devout
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Lord Viṣṇu).<sup>59</sup> No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification
<div n="lb"/>of his name Samudragupta.<sup>60</sup> Mookerji says that the name
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests.
<div n="lb"/>It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion
<div n="lb"/>which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as
<div n="lb"/>extending up to the four oceans ({%caturudadhisalilāsvāditaya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śasaḥ%}). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts,
<div n="lb"/>Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his
<div n="lb"/>surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his
<div n="lb"/>coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’
<div n="lb"/>while the reverse has {%‘Parākramaḥ’%} as his title. The name
<div n="lb"/>‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such
<div n="lb"/>as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.<sup>61</sup> Mookerji<sup>62</sup> holds that
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.<sup>63</sup> Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>in his Kāvyalaṃkāra<sup>64</sup> refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta.<sup>65</sup> But it seems to be the name of a local king of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta
<div n="lb"/>dynasty.<sup>66</sup> Another probable and most suitable explanation
<div n="lb"/>of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’,
<div n="lb"/>Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of
<div n="lb"/>these are also supported by numismatic evidence.<sup>68</sup>
