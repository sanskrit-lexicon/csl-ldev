<div n="lb">are the {%buddhi,%} called also {%kṣetrajña%} (the individual soul),

<div n="lb">is: 1, the creatures; 2, their qualities; 3, the elements;
<div n="lb">D., men, G., Pś., As., and Rā. have all sprung from Nature
<div n="lb">{%(svabhāvataḥ),%} and not from actions, nor from a cause; [the
<div n="lb">elements are called] the brahmans, who are creators of the
<div n="lb">universe [and] are born here again and again; all that springs
<div n="lb">from them is dissolved in those very five great elements like
<div n="lb">billows in the ocean; [beyond] those elements that compose
<div n="lb">the universe ({%viśvasṛgbhyas tu bhūtebhyaḥ,%} i.e. the gross elements)
<div n="lb">are the five great elements (i.e. the subtle elements; read
<div n="lb">{%°bhūtās%} with B.), and higher than these is the way of the
<div n="lb">emancipated (read {%mukto%} with B.); {%Prajāpati%} created all this
<div n="lb">by the mind alone; in the same manner Ṛ. attained to
<div n="lb">[the status of] D. by the aid of penance; (the wonderful
