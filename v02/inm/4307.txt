[{@Guruśiṣyasaṃvāda@}]¦ (“discourse between a preceptor
and his disciple”). § 782{%g%} (Anugītāparvan): {%Kṛṣṇa%} said:
Asked by his disciple “Whence am I? whence art thou?”
etc., the preceptor said: This was declared by {%Brahmán%}
himself to Ṛ.; it was known to the conclaves of Si. in the
ancient {%kalpas%}. In days of old Ṛ. {%Bṛhaspati%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) assembled
together for asking one another, tired with their acts; placing
Ṛ. {%Āṅgirasa%} at their head, they beheld, in the abode of
{%Brahmán, Brahmán%} free from sin, and were instructed by
him about how a good man should act, about Emancipation,
etc. “Truth is the universe of being,” light, ether, sun,
wind, {%Indra%} and {%Prajāpati%} are not seen as long as one has
not attained to {%Adhyātma%}; religion has faith ({%śraddhā%}) for
its indication; the number of elements ({%tattva%}) are twenty-
four and one more (XIV, {@35@}). {%Brahmán%} discoursed on the
city of nine gates, the three qualities, etc., the qualities
belonging to darkness (birth as {%Cāṇḍālas%}, etc.); Ṛ., Mu., and
D. become deluded, desirous of pleasure (XIV, {@36@}).
{%Brahmán%} discoursed on passion (XIV, {@37@}) and {%sattva%}
(XIV, {@38@}); the qualities are not completely separated from
one another, etc. (XIV, {@39@}); from the unmanifest first
sprang the great soul, the source of all intelligence, the
source of all qualities, called {%Mahān ātmā, Viṣṇu, Jiṣṇu%},
{%Śambhu, Buddhi%}, etc., pervading everything in the universe,
stationed in the heart of all, endued with minuteness,
lightness, and affluence ({%prāpti%}); this is said to be the first
creation (XIV, {@40@}); the great ({%Mahān%}), who was first
[Page314-b+ 25]
produced and called {%Ahaṅkāra%}, is the second creation, the
source of all creatures, a god, the creator of gods, etc.
(XIV, {@41@}); from {%Ahaṅkārā%} was born the five great elements;
the {%prāṇas%}, etc.; the eleven organs sprung from {%Ahaṅkāra%}:—
<C n="1"/>ENTITY ({%bhūtas%}). <C n="2"/>ON THE SELF ({%adhyātmaṃ%}). <C n="3"/>AMONG OBJECTS ({%adhibhūtaṃ%}). <C n="4"/>AMONG GODS ({%adhidaivataṃ%}).
<C n="1"/>1. ether ({%ākāśa%}). <C n="2"/>ear ({%śrotra)…%} <C n="3"/>sound ({%śabda)…%} <C n="4"/>the Quarters ({%Diśaḥ%}).

<C n="1"/>5. earth ({%pṛthivī%}). <C n="2"/>nose ({%ghrāṇa)…%} <C n="3"/>scent ({%gandha)…%} <C n="4"/>the Wind ({%Vāyu%}).

<C n="1"/>8. <C n="2"/>organ of generation ({%upastha)…%} <C n="3"/>vital seed ({%śukra)…%} <C n="4"/>{%Prajāpati%}.
<C n="1"/>9. <C n="2"/>hands ({%hastau)…%} <C n="3"/>actions ({%karmāṇi)…%} <C n="4"/>{%Śakra%} (Indra).

<C n="1"/>11. <C n="2"/>mind ({%manas)…%} <C n="3"/>mental operation ({%saṅkalpa)…%} <C n="4"/>the Moon ({%Candramas%}).
<C n="1"/>12. <C n="2"/>egoism ({%ahaṅkāra: sarvasṃsārakārakaṃ%}). <C n="3"/>consciousness of self ({%abhimāna)…%} <C n="4"/>{%Rudra%}.
<C n="1"/>13. <C n="2"/>understanding ({%buddhi: ṣaḍindriyavioāriṇī%}) <C n="3"/>what is to be understood ({%mantavyaṃ)…%} <C n="4"/>{%Brahmán%}.
Three are the seats of all existent objects: land, water, and
ether; the mode of birth is fourfold (from eggs, germs,
filth, or wombs) (specification); etc.; on the means of
attaining to {%Brahmán%}; on the body; the emancipated one is
{%Viṣṇu%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); †him praise brahmans, D., As., Y., Pś., P.,
birds, Rā., Bh., and M.-ṛ. († v. 1169) (XIV, {@42@}); the
{%kṣatriya%}, elephant, lion, sheep, snake, bull, and male are of
[Page315-a+ 47]
middle quality [i.e. {%rajas%}]; the {%nyagrodha%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>) are the
foremost among trees; {%Himavat%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>) are the foremost
among mountains; M. are the foremost of the {%gaṇas%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">θ</lang>); [in v. 1201 it is {%Vāyu%} who resides in the skin and is
employed in the perception of touch, etc.] (XIV, {@43@}); the
day was first, then arose the night, etc.; the months are
said to begin with the bright fortnights; the constellations
begin with {%Śravaṇa%}; the seasons with winter ({%śiśira%}), etc.
(<lang n="greek">ι</lang>) (XIV, {@44@}); on the wheel of life (XIV, {@45@}); on the
duties that men should observe (XIV, {@46@}); on renunciation,
knowledge, and power (XIV, {@47@}); on the different conceptions
of {%Bráhman%} (a tree, a forest, unmanifest, etc.); it is impossible
to attain to {%Puruṣa%} by any other means than goodness;
some assert the unity of {%Kṣetrajña%} and {%sattva%}; this is not
correct; the relation of {%Puruṣa%} to {%sattva%} is like that of the
gnat to the {%udumbara%}, or that of water-drops on the leaf of
a lotus. The Ṛ. once more asked (XIV, {@48@}) about the
diversities of practice observed by men, and about the
connection between the {%Kṣetrajña%} and {%sattva%} (XIV, {@49@}).
{%Brahmán%}, quoting what was said by a preceptor to a disciple,
said that abstention from harming any creature is the foremost
of all duties, and the relation between {%sattva%} and {%Kṣetrajña%}
({%Puruṣa%}) is that of the object ({%viṣaya%}) to the subject
({%viṣayitva%}), or like that of the matter to the maker, or like
that of a lamp (with oil and wick) to him who lights it;
{%sattva%} is manifest, while {%Puruṣa%} is unmanifest; knowledge
is indispensable for attaining to felicity; from {%pradhāna%}
develops {%mahat%}, from {%mahat ahaṅkāra%}, from {%ahaṅkāra%} the five
elements; the qualities of the elements are the following:—
<C n="1"/>ELEMENTS. <C n="2"/> <C n="3"/> <C n="4"/>QUALITIES.
<C n="1"/>ether (space) <C n="6"/>sound.
<C n="1"/>wind <C n="5"/>touch <C n="6"/>sound.

<C n="1"/>earth <C n="2"/>smell <C n="3"/>taste <C n="4"/>{%rūpa%} <C n="5"/>touch <C n="6"/>sound.

[Page315-b+ 59]
Space (ether) is the highest of the elements > (i.e. above it
is) {%ahaṅkāra > buddhi > ātman%} (the soul) > the unmanifest
{%avyaktaṃ > Puruṣa%} (XIV, {@50@}). {%Brahmán%} said: The body
is called the carriage of {%Bráhman%}, on which the individual
soul drives about; the senses are the steeds; the mind is the
charioteer, called also the {%bhūtātman%} (the individual soul),
because it is the ruler of the elements ({%bhūtāni%}); the reins
are the {%buddhi%}, called also {%kṣetrajña%} (the individual soul),
because it “proclaims power.” The order of the dissolution
is: 1, the creatures; 2, their qualities; 3, the elements;
D., men, G., Pś., As., and Rā. have all sprung from Nature
({%svabhāvataḥ%}), and not from actions, nor from a cause; [the
elements are called] the brahmans, who are creators of the
universe [and] are born here again and again; all that springs
from them is dissolved in those very five great elements like
billows in the ocean; [beyond] those elements that compose
the universe ({%viśvasṛgbhyas tu bhūtebhyaḥ%}, i.e. the gross elements)
are the five great elements (i.e. the subtle elements; read
{%°bhūtās%} with B.), and higher than these is the way of the
emancipated (read {%mukto%} with B.); {%Prajāpati%} created all this
by the mind alone; in the same manner Ṛ. attained to
[the status of] D. by the aid of penance; (the wonderful
effects of penance, by which one may be cleansed from the
most horrible sins, etc.; men, P., deities, etc., have been
crowned with success by penance alone); different degrees of
bliss after death ({%Prajāpati%}; the great highest region—
{%mahāntaṃ lokam uttamaṃ%}; the unmanifest accumulation of
happiness—{%sukhopacayam avyaktaṃ%}; the unmanifest, i.e. the
highest region of the great ones—{%avyaktaṃ mahatāṃ lokam%}
{%uttamaṃ%}), according as one performs acts with expectation,
being full of egoism ({%ahaṅkāra-samāyuktāḥ%}), or is devoid of
selfiṣness ({%nirmamāḥ%}), and freed from egoism ({%nirahaṅkṛtāḥ%})
through {%yoga%}; freed from darkness and passion and adhering
only to goodness, one becomes released from every sin and
creates all things: such a one should be known to be [perfect]
{%kṣetrajña%}: he who knows him knows the {%Veda%}; that which
begins with the unmanifest and ends with the gross qualities
({%°viśeṣāntaṃ%}), has ignorance for its indication; selfishness
({%mama%}) is death, the reverse ({%na mama%}) is the eternal
[{%Bráhman%}]; the high-minded ancients never applaud action:
by action a creature is born with body; the indication of
tranquillity is like what takes place in a dream; this is the
goal of the emancipated ones who are intent on knowledge.
The preceptor said: Thus addressed by {%Brahmán%}, Mu. acted
accordingly and attained to felicity ({%lokaṃ). Kṛṣṇa%} said:
The pupil acted accordingly and then attained to emancipation
(XIV, {@51@}).
