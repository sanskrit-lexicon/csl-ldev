[{@Anukramaṇikā-parvan@}],¦ the first of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">(cf. Anukramaṇī). § 1: The Sūta Ugraśravas (Sauti), son
<div n="lb">of Lomaharṣaṇa, had heard the Mahābhārata, which had been
<div n="lb">composed by Vyāsa, recited—under the direction of Dvai-
<div n="lb">pāyana (i.e. Vyāsa) himself—by Vaiśampāyana, disciple of
<div n="lb">Vyāsa, at the serpent-sacrifice of king Janamejaya, son of
<div n="lb">Parikṣit; he had thereupon undertaken a pilgrimage to the
<div n="lb">tīrthas (holy places) and visited Samantapañcaka {%(b);%} thence
<div n="lb">he came to the twelve years’ sattra (long sacrifice) of
[Page061-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">Śaunaka in the Naimiṣa forest, where he related the
<div n="lb">Mahābhārata, (§ 2) beginning with the adoration of Viṣṇu
<div n="lb">identified with the Absolute (Brahmán), and (§ 3) a brief
<div n="lb">exposition of the creation and succession of beings from the
<div n="lb">Absolute through Brahmán, the 21 Prajāpatis (<lang n="greek"></lang>), gods,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), down to the families of the Kurus, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">mentioned in the poem.—§ 4: The Mahābhārata contains
<div n="lb">an enlarged and an abridged form; some make it begin with
<div n="lb">Manu (i.e. I, {@75,@} 18 = 3143; otherwise Nīl.), some with Āstīka
<div n="lb">(i.e. I, {@13,@} 1 = 1020), and some with Uparicara (i.e. I, {@63,@} 1
<div n="lb">= 2334) (v. 52). Vyāsa had composed the Mahābhārata in
<div n="lb">a moment, and, at the counsel of Brahmán, had Gaṇeśa to
<div n="lb">write it down as fast as he dictated to him. (An enumeration
<div n="lb">of the first sixteen books is contained in v. 88—91.) The
<div n="lb">portion destined for men (100,000 ślokas out of six millions)
<div n="lb">he taught Vaiśampāyana, who narrated it in the intervals
<div n="lb">between the parts of the serpent-sacrifice of Janamejaya,
<div n="lb">first giving a survey of the principal contents (<lang n="greek"></lang>), partly in
<div n="lb">the form of a conversation between Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
<div n="lb">Sañjaya.—§ 5: Sañjaya, in order to console Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb">first enumerated 24 great kings (<lang n="greek"></lang>), who were formerly
<div n="lb">mentioned by Nārada to Śaivya (B. Śvaitya) when lamenting
<div n="lb">the loss of a son, and thereupon (§ 6) 66 others (<lang n="greek"></lang>), who
<div n="lb">had all died.—§ 7: He, who hears or reads the Mahābhārata,
<div n="lb">is purified from the most atrocious sins (261 ff. = 254 ff.).
