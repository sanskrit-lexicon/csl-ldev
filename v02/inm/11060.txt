{@Udapāna@},¦ one or more tīrthas. § 370 (Tīrthayātrāp.): III,
{@84@}, 8088.—§ 615{%b%} (Baladevatīrthayātrā): Although the
{%Sarasvatī%} seems to be lost there, yet, owing to the succu-
lence of the herbs and the moistness of the land, holy persons
know [that] the river [has an invisible current there] (IX,
{@35@}). There the great ascetic {%Trita%} had lived and drunk
{%soma%} in a pit, where his two brothers had left him, and
therefore were cursed by him. Requested by {%Janamejaya%}
{%Vaiśampāyana%} related: In a former {%yuga%} there were three
brothers who were ascetics: {%Ekata, Dvita%}, and {%Trita%}, like to
{%Prajāpati%}, having by their tapas won {%Brahmaloka (Brahma-%}
{%lokajitaḥ%}), and being blessed with children. At last their
father {%Gautama%} died, having passed a long life here. Those
kings who had been his {%yajamānas%} continued to pay respect
to his sons. Once, thinking of performing a sacrifice and
having received animals from their {%yajamānas%}, those {%maharṣis%}
came towards the east. {%Trita%} was walking in front, {%Ekata%}
and {%Dvita%} in his rear, bringing up the animals. {%Ekata%} and
{%Dvita%} thought of taking the kine away and deserting
{%Trita%}. In the night they saw a wolf. {%Trita%} ran in fright
and fell into a deep pit on the bank of the {%Sarasvatī%}.
Though hearing his wails of woe, his brothers deserted him.
{%Trita%} feared to die because he had not earned the merit of
drinking {%soma%}, and in imagination performed a sacrifice,
himself being the {%hotṛ%} and uttering the {%ṛces, yajuṣes%}, and
{%sāmans%} (description). {%Bṛhaspati%} prevailed upon the gods to
go there lest {%Trita%} should become angry and create other
gods. {%Trita%} duly gave them their shares with proper
{%mantras%}; they granted him boons; that the gods should
deliver him [from the well], and that he who bathes in that
well shall have the end which is attained by persons who
have drunk {%soma%}. At these words the {%Sarasvatī%}, with her
waves, appeared within that well. Raised aloft by her,
{%Trita%} emerged and worshipped the gods. Meeting his
brothers he cursed them, saying that they should become
wolves and have for offspring leopards and bears and apes
