{@Udapāna,@}¦ one or more tīrthas. § 370 (Tīrthayātrāp.): III,
<div n="lb">{@84,@} 8088.—§ 615{%b%} (Baladevatīrthayātrā): Although the
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī%} seems to be lost there, yet, owing to the succu-
<div n="lb">lence of the herbs and the moistness of the land, holy persons
<div n="lb">know [that] the river [has an invisible current there] (IX,
<div n="lb">{@35@}). There the great ascetic {%Trita%} had lived and drunk
<div n="lb">{%soma%} in a pit, where his two brothers had left him, and
<div n="lb">therefore were cursed by him. Requested by {%Janamejaya%}
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} related: In a former {%yuga%} there were three
<div n="lb">brothers who were ascetics: {%Ekata, Dvita,%} and {%Trita,%} like to
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpati,%} having by their tapas won {%Brahmaloka (Brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%lokajitaḥ),%} and being blessed with children. At last their
<div n="lb">father {%Gautama%} died, having passed a long life here. Those
<div n="lb">kings who had been his {%yajamānas%} continued to pay respect
<div n="lb">to his sons. Once, thinking of performing a sacrifice and
<div n="lb">having received animals from their {%yajamānas,%} those {%maharṣis%}
<div n="lb">came towards the east. {%Trita%} was walking in front, {%Ekata%}
<div n="lb">and {%Dvita%} in his rear, bringing up the animals. {%Ekata%} and
<div n="lb">{%Dvita%} thought of taking the kine away and deserting
<div n="lb">{%Trita.%} In the night they saw a wolf. {%Trita%} ran in fright
<div n="lb">and fell into a deep pit on the bank of the {%Sarasvatī.%}
<div n="lb">Though hearing his wails of woe, his brothers deserted him.
<div n="lb">{%Trita%} feared to die because he had not earned the merit of
<div n="lb">drinking {%soma,%} and in imagination performed a sacrifice,
<div n="lb">himself being the {%hotṛ%} and uttering the {%ṛces, yajuṣes,%} and
<div n="lb">{%sāmans%} (description). {%Bṛhaspati%} prevailed upon the gods to
<div n="lb">go there lest {%Trita%} should become angry and create other
<div n="lb">gods. {%Trita%} duly gave them their shares with proper
<div n="lb">{%mantras;%} they granted him boons; that the gods should
<div n="lb">deliver him [from the well], and that he who bathes in that
<div n="lb">well shall have the end which is attained by persons who
<div n="lb">have drunk {%soma.%} At these words the {%Sarasvatī,%} with her
<div n="lb">waves, appeared within that well. Raised aloft by her,
<div n="lb">{%Trita%} emerged and worshipped the gods. Meeting his
<div n="lb">brothers he cursed them, saying that they should become
<div n="lb">wolves and have for offspring leopards and bears and apes
