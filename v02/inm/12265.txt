[{@Vrīhidrauṇikaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“on the droṇa of rice”,
the 45th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 519. Dwelling
in the woods, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} spent eleven years in a miserable
plight, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} repenting of his act of gambling, and
the others thinking of revenge. Once {%Vyāsa%} came to them
and spoke to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the meritoriousness of
asceticism, saying that a wise man, knowing that life has its
ups and downs, is neither filled with joy nor with grief,
while foolish persons are reborn as beasts in after life;
nothing in this world is more difficult to practise than
charity, and therefore charity is superior to everything; even
a small gift may be of great result in future life, provided
that what is given away is properly acquired and, with a
pure mind and in due time, bestowed on pious persons; but
the bestowal of ill-gotten gains can never rescue the giver
from evil (III, {@259@}).—§ 520: Mudgala (q.v.)
