§ 717{%c%} (Nārāyaṇīya): {%Bhīṣma%} said: There was, in times
past, a king named {%U.%}, the friend of {%Indra%}, and devoted to
{%Hari Nārāyaṇa%}; he won the sovereignty of the world in
consequence of a boon he had obtained from {%Nārāyaṇa%}, and
used to worship him with the {%Sātvata%} ritual ({%Sāttvatānāṃ%}
{%Pāñcarātrāṇāṃ hitaṃ%}, Nīl.), revealed in days of yore by {%Sūrya%}
himself, etc. {%Indra%} gave him a share in his own seat and
bed. The foremost of those conversant with the {%Pāñcarātra%}
({%Pāñcarātravidaḥ%}) dwelled in his palaces. The seven ṛṣis
(<lang n="greek">β</lang>), named the {%Citraśikhaṇḍins%}, uniting together, had on
{%Meru%} promulgated an excellent treatise on duties; they were
the seven {%prakṛtis%} (i.e. {%mahat, ahaṅkāra%}, etc., Nīl.), and
{%[Manu] Svāyambhuva%} was the eighth (i.e. original Prakṛti,
Nīl.); they composed that treatise after having worshipped
with penances {%Hari Nārāyaṇa%} for 1,000 celestial years,
together with many other ṛṣis; {%Nārāyaṇa%} ordered {%Sarasvatī%}
to enter into the persons of these ṛṣis and became highly
pleased with the treatise, which was in accordance with the
{%Vedas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Nārāyaṇa%} said: “According to the authority
of the scriptures I have created {%Brahmán%} from grace, {%Rudra%}
from my wrath, and yourselves as representing the {%prakṛti-%}
elements. {%Sūrya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) live and act in their respective
spheres; guided by your treatise {%Manu Svāyambhuva%} will
declare the duties to the world, and so will {%Uśanas%} and
{%Bṛhaspati%}, when they will arise; then this science will be
acquired by king {%Vasu [Uparicara]%} from {%Bṛhaspati%}; upon
the death of that king this eternal treatise will disappear from
the world.” Then {%Nārāyaṇa%} disappeared. Subsequently,
when {%Bṛhaspati%} was born in the {%Aṅgiras%} race in the {%Kṛta%} age,
those seven ṛṣis charged him with the task of promulgating
their treatise, which was consistent with the {%Upaniṣads%} and
the branches of the {%Vedas%}. Then they proceeded to the place
they chose for practising penances (XII, {@336@}). Etymology of
the name {%Bṛhaspati%}. King {%Vasu Uparicara%} became the fore-
most of {%Bṛhaspati's%} disciples, and studied at his feet that
science of the {%Citraśikhaṇḍins%}. In his horse-sacrifice {%Bṛhaspati%}
became the {%hotṛ%}, the sons of {%Prajāpati%}, viz. {%Ekata, Dvita%}, and
{%Trita%}, the {%sadasyas%}, together with {%Dhanuṣa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); no
animals were slain in it; {%Hari%} became gratified and came and
took his share, visible to {%Vasu%}, but invisible to the others. At
this {%Bṛhaspati%} became angry and hurled the sacrificial ladle
with violence into the skies, saying: “Here I place this as
{%Nārāyaṇa's%} share, he shall take it before my eyes.” {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} asked why {%Hari%} only took his share invisibly. Bhīṣma
answered: King {%Vasu%} and his {%sadasyas%} sought to pacify {%Bṛhas-%}
{%pati%}, saying that none should feel anger in this {%Kṛta%} age, as
{%Hari%} himself did not feel anger, and none could see him save
he to whom he became gracious. Then the ṛṣis, {%Ekata, Dvita%},
[Page693-b+ 63]
and {%Trita%} (the mindborn sons of Brahmán) narrated that
they had once undergone penances for thousands of years,
to the north of Meru and on the shores of the milky
ocean in order to behold {%Nārāyaṇa%} in his own form, then
an incorporeal voice directed them to {%Śvetadvīpa%} on the
northern shore of the milky ocean; the inhabitants there
are devoted to {%Nārāyaṇa%}, etc. (description) and adore only
one god: Arrived there they could see nothing, blinded
by the splendour of the deity; they then, once more, set
themselves to practise austerities for 100 years, then they
beheld the inhabitants (description, they are conversant with
the ordinances of the {%Pāñcarātra%}). An incorporeal being
addressed them from the sky, saying that the god could only
be seen by these white men, etc.: “do ye return, after the
expiration of this {%Kṛta%} age when the {%Tretā%} age comes (in the
{%Vaivasvata manvantara%}) a great calamity will overtake the
worlds, you shall then have to become the allies of the gods.”
Then {%Ekata%}, etc., returned. Hearing this {%Bṛhaspati%} brought
the sacrifice to completion. King {%U%}. ruled his subjects
righteously, and at last, giving up his body, ascended to
heaven. After some time he, through the curse of the
brahmans, fell down and sank deep into the earth; but even
then he, by reciting sacred mantras having {%Nārāyaṇa%} for
their deity, once more ascended to heaven through the grace
of {%Nārāyaṇa%} (XII, {@337@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked why king
{%Vasu%}, who was so devoted to {%Nārāyaṇa%}, did fall from heaven
and sink beneath the surface of the earth. {%Bhīṣma%} cited
the old narrative of a discourse between the ṛṣis and the
gods. The gods once said to some brahmans that sacrifices
should be performed by offering goats ({%aja%}). The ṛṣis
declared that, according to a {%Vedic śruti%}, by {%aja%} was to be
understood seeds; “how can animals be slain in the {%Kṛta%}
age?” {%Vasu%} was coming through the skies with his troops,
etc., and was asked to be their judge. Having first ascer-
tained what opinion was entertained by each of them, {%Vasu%},
moved by partiality for the gods, said that sacrifices should be
performed with animals. The {%ṛṣis%} became very angry, and
cursed him to fall down from heaven and sink below the
surface of the earth. He immediately fell, but at the
command of {%Nārāyaṇa, Vasu's%} memory did not leave him.
The gods came to his hole and said that he should have the
{%vasor-dhārā%} (v. the note of PCR., p. 758) for his sustenance
as long as he remained there. Then the gods and the {%ṛṣis%}
went away. {%Vasu%} began to adore {%Hari%} and to recite in
silence those sacred mantras which had come out of {%Nārāyaṇa's%}
mouth in days of yore, and worshipped him in the five sacrifices
which are performed five times every day. {%Hari Nārāyaṇa%}
({%Viṣṇu%}) then let {%Garuḍa%} take {%Vasu%} to {%Brahmaloka%} (XII,
{@338@}): XII, {@336@}, 12712 ({%rājo°ḥ%}); {@337@}, 12754 ({%rājo°o%}
{%Vasuḥ%}), 12766; {@338@}, 12834 ({%rājo°ḥ%}), 12838 ({%rājo°ṃ(!)%}),
12855 ({%rājo°ḥ%}).
