{@Jantūpākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to Jantu”). § 11:
I, {@2@}, 447.—§ 408 (Tīrthay.): Questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Lomaśa%} said: King {%Somaka%} had 100 wives, but was a long
time sonless. At last, when he and his wives were old, he
got a son {%Jantu%}, whom all the wives surrounded with the
utmost care. One day when {%Jantu%} had been stung by an ant
at his hip and cried, {%Somaka%}, afraid of losing him, inquired
of his {%ṛtvij%} if there were a ceremony by which a man might
get 100 sons. He was told to sacrifice {%Jantu%} and let his wives
take a smell of the smoke of his fat; then 100 sons would be
born to him, and {%Jantu%} himself would be born once more of
the same mother, with a mark of gold on his back (III, {@127@}).
The sacrifice was performed notwithstanding the screams of
the wives, and after ten months 100 sons were born, of
whom {%Jantu%} was the eldest and most beloved and superior
in merit, and had that mark of gold. When the {%guru%} and
{%Somaka%} had died, the {%purohita%} was grilled in a terrible hell
for having performed that sacrifice, and {%Somaka%} prevailed
upon {%Dharmarāja%} (who said “one cannot enjoy or suffer for
another person's acts”) that he should be likewise tormented
[Page353-b+ 63]
for the same period before he entered the blessed regions.
Here they (the Pāṇḍavas, etc.) spent six nights (III, {@128@}).
