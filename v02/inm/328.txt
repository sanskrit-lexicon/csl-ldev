{@Ājagaraparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the Boa”; the
40th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 448: The Pāṇḍavas
spent four years with <is>Arjuna</is> in the gardens of Kubera,
which added to the preceding six make ten years of exile.
In the eleventh year <is>Yudhiṣṭhira</is>, advised by Bhīma,
took leave of those regions, determining again to practise
austerities on the mountain, when he had regained his
kingdom; and after <is>Lomaśa</is> had returned to the abode
of the gods, they with the brahmans proceeded along that
very road, carried by <is>Ghaṭotkaca</is> and his followers, and
advised also by Ārṣṭiṣeṇa (III, {@176@}).—§ 449: Having
crossed <is>Kailāsa</is>, they passed one night in the hermitage
of king <is>Vṛṣaparvan</is> ({%b%}), then one month at <is>Badarī</is>,
seeing Kubera's ({%c%}) favourite lake ({%nalinīm%}), then crossing
the land of <is>Cīna, Tuṣāra, Darada</is>, and all the regions
of <is>Kulinda</is>, and the difficult Himālaya regions, they
reached the city of the <is>Kirāta</is> king <is>Subāhu</is>, where they
met with their charioteers <is>Viśoka</is>, etc., and their servants
<is>Mahendrasena</is>, etc., the cooks and servants of the kitchen.
After having stayed there one night, they, dismissing
Ghaṭotkaca and his followers, with the charioteers and
chariots reached “the king of mountains” near <is>Yamunā</is>
({%Yāmunam adrirājam%}, i.e. {%Yamunodgamam%}, Nīl.; “name of
a mountain,” BR.), where they dwelt for one year, occupied
[Page027-b+ 63]
with hunting, in the forest <is>Viśākhayūpa</is>. There in a cavern
Bhīma was seized by a snake and rescued by Yudhiṣṭhira.
In the twelfth year of their exile they repaired thence to
the borders of the desert, and desirous of dwelling by the
<is>Sarasvatī</is> ({%d%}), they went there, and thence reached the
lake of <is>Dvaitavana</is> (III, {@177@}).—§ 450: At the request
of Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana detailed how Bhīma, when
they had come from the rājarṣi Vṛṣaparvan's hermitage,
was hunting with unpoisoned ({%śuddhair%}) arrows on some spots
of <is>Himavat</is> ({%b%}), was seized by a huge snake, and on
account of a boon that had been granted to the serpent
was quite unable to extricate himself (III, {@178@}). The
serpent said that he was the rājarṣi <is>Nahuṣa</is>, the son of
<is>Āyu</is>, whom <is>Agastya</is> had cursed to become a serpent, out of
compassion, however, adding to his curse that the person who
would be able to answer his questions would deliver him, and
that even stronger beings would, when seized by him, lose
their strength. He had retained his recollection of his former
existence, and nobody who came within his reach at the sixth
division of the day ({%? ṣaṣṭhe kāle: aṣṭadhā vibhaktasyāhno%}
{%bhāge%}, Nīl.) could escape him. Bhīma lamented. Now
appeared dreadful omens to Yudhiṣṭhira there, and having
learnt from Draupadī that Bhīma had long been out, he
set out with Dhaumya, having directed <is>Arjuna</is> to protect
Draupadī, and <is>Nakula</is> and <is>Sahadeva</is> to protect the
brahmans; and in the east, following the tracks of Bhīma,
he came to the spot (III, {@179@}). The serpent told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira who he was, refused other food instead of Bhīma,
but promised to deliver him if Yudhiṣṭhira could answer his
questions. The first question was about the characteristics
of the brahman, etc. (III, {@180@}). Yudhiṣṭhira asked the
serpent some questions about the means of salvation, and
some other moral and philosophical questions, about the
difference between the mind ({%manas%}) and the intellect
({%buddhi%}), and what had caused Nahuṣa's fall. Nahuṣa
told that in heaven he used to exact tribute from brah-
marṣis, gods, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Pannagas,
etc.; and that such was the spell of his eyes, that on
whatever creature he fixed them he instantly destroyed its
power; Agastya had foretold that Yudhiṣṭhira would save
him from his curse. He delivered Bhīma unhurt, and,
assuming his celestial shape, went back to heaven. Yudhi-
ṣṭhira returned with Dhaumya and Bhīma, and narrated all
that to the brahmans, who censured Bhīma, and warned him
against attempting such things again (III, {@181@}).
