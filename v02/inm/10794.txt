{@Tārakavadhopākhyāna@}¦ (“the episode relating to the
<div n="lb">destruction of Tāraka”; continuation of Suvarṇotpatti,
<div n="lb">§ 747{%b%}). § 748{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): D. and Ṛ., reduced to great
<div n="lb">distress [by Tāraka's prowess and the conduct of Gaṅgā by
<div n="lb">throwing away Agni's seed], urged the six {%Kṛttikāḥ%} to rear that
<div n="lb">child [i.e. Skanda]. Amongst the celestial ladies there were
<div n="lb">none, save these, that could bear the seed of {%Agni%} in their
<div n="lb">wombs. {%Agni%} became gratified. His energy was divided
<div n="lb">into six portions, and a portion was placed in each of the
<div n="lb">{%Kṛttikās.%} All of them were delivered at the same time, and
<div n="lb">the six portions united into one. The Earth received the child
<div n="lb">from a heap of gold. He grew up in a celestial forest of
<div n="lb">reeds, reared by the {%Kṛttikās%} (whence he came to be called
<div n="lb">{%Kārttikeya;%} etymology of {%Skanda%} and {%Guha%}). The thirty-
<div n="lb">three gods, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) came to see him; Ṛ. praised him, G. sang
<div n="lb">in honour of {%Kumāra,%} with six faces, etc. (description). The
<div n="lb">gods gave him various kinds of toys, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Rā. and As.
<div n="lb">began to walk in the train of {%Skanda. Tāraka%} in vain sought,
<div n="lb">by various means, to slay him. The gods made him the
<div n="lb">commander of their forces, and when he had grown up he
<div n="lb">slew {%Tāraka%} with his irresistible dart as in sport, and
<div n="lb">re-established {%Indra%} in the sovereignty. {%Skanda%} became the
<div n="lb">protector of the gods and [always] did what was agreeable to
<div n="lb">{%Śaṅkara%} (i.e. Śiva). Gold is the powerful energy of {%Agni%} and
<div n="lb">was born [from the same seed] with {%Kārttikeya;%} hence gold
<div n="lb">is highly auspicious. Thus did {%Vasiṣṭha%} relate to {%Rāma%}
<div n="lb">{%[Jāmadagnya]%} in days of old. By making gifts of gold {%Rāma%}
<div n="lb">became purified of all his sins, and [finally] attained to a
<div n="lb">high place in heaven that is not easily attainable by men
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@86@}).
