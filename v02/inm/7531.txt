{@Nakulākhyāna@}¦ (“the narrative of the mungoose”). § 11
<div n="lb">(Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2,@} 609.—§ 786{%b%} (Anugītāparvan): At the
<div n="lb">conclusion of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} horse-sacrifice, after everybody
<div n="lb">had been gratified, a blue-eyed mungoose, with one side of its
<div n="lb">body changed into gold, came and said, in voice as loud and
<div n="lb">deep as thunder, that this great sacrifice was not equal to
<div n="lb">a {%prastha%} of powdered barley given away by a liberal
<div n="lb">brahman of {%Kurukṣetra,%} who was observing the {%uñcha-%} (or
<div n="lb">the pigeon-) vow. Asked by the brahmans the mungoose
<div n="lb">related: The brahman named lived with his wife, son, and
<div n="lb">daughter-in-law, and practised penances; he used to eat
<div n="lb">every day at the sixth division; during a famine he had
<div n="lb">nothing to eat day after day; one day in the month of
<div n="lb">{%Jyaiṣṭha,%} while the sun was in the meridian, he was picking
<div n="lb">up grains of corn, but got nothing; one day, after the sixth
<div n="lb">division had come, he obtained a {%prastha%} of barley, which they
<div n="lb">reduced to powder for making {%saktu;%} having finished their
<div n="lb">recitations and libations, etc., they divided the powdered
<div n="lb">barley among themselves, so that each got a {%kuḍava;%} then
<div n="lb">came a guest, who ate all the portions, the wife, son, and
<div n="lb">daughter-in-law with difficulty prevailing upon the brahman
<div n="lb">to give their portions as well. The guest turned out to be
<div n="lb">{%Dharma;%} flowers were rained down from heaven; D.-ṛ, D., G.,
<div n="lb">{%Devadūtas,%} etc., and B.-ṛ. standing in {%vimānas%} and dwelling in
<div n="lb">{%Brahmaloka%} were struck with wonder; “I have been rescued,
<div n="lb">and others who have not yet come {%(anāgatāḥ)%} have been
<div n="lb">rescued for countless {%yugas;%} he that gives away 100 having
<div n="lb">1,000, 10 having 100, and a handful of water having no
<div n="lb">wealth, are equal in merit,” citing {%Rantideva (c), Nṛga (d),%} and
<div n="lb">{%Śibi Auśīnara;%} “thou hast conquered {%Brahmaloka.%}” The
<div n="lb">brahman, with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law, proceeded
<div n="lb">to heaven on a celestial chariot. The mungoose continued:
<div n="lb">“I came out of my hole, and by the contact with the powder
<div n="lb">of barley, etc., my head and half of my body became gold;
<div n="lb">in order to convert the rest of my body into gold I repeatedly
<div n="lb">repair to the hermitages of ascetics and to the sacrifices of
<div n="lb">kings; I came hither with high hopes, but I have not been made
<div n="lb">into gold.” Then the mungoose disappeared (XIV, {@90@}).—
<div n="lb">That mungoose was {%Dharma,%} who having injured {%Jama-%}
<div n="lb">{%dagni (f)%} had been cursed by the {%Pitṛs,%} but became freed
<div n="lb">from the curse by disparaging himself in the form of
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (XIV, {@92@}).
