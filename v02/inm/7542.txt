[{@Nalopākhyānaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Nala,” the 35th of the minor parvans of the Mahābhāraṭa;
cf. Nalopākhyāna).—§ 343: One day, when the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
were grieving for {%Arjuna, Bhīma%} asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
permit him to go and slay {%Duryodhana%}, interpreting the
time to be complete (“as in the {%Veda%} a day is often
equivalent to a year, when passed in suffering”) ({%kṛcchrataḥ%}),
but he did not prevail upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. While they were
conversing the great {%ṛṣi Bṛhadaśva%} came before them, and,
asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if there was on earth a king more
unfortunate than himself, he said that he would narrate a
history of a prince more miserable than {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, viz.
{%Nala%} (the son of the {%Niṣadha%} king {%Vīrasena%}), who, defeated
deceitfully by {%Puṣkara%} (the brother of {%Nala%}, v. 2296),
dwelt in the woods with his spouse, having neither slaves
nor chariots nor brothers nor friends with him (III, {@52@}).—
§ 344: {%Bṛhadaśva%} said: The {%Niṣadha%} king {%Nala%}, the son
of {%Vīrasena%}, was above all kings, etc., and fond of dice.
[Page500-a+ 63]
The {%Vidarbha%} king {%Bhīma%} was granted by the {%Brahmarṣi%}
{%Damana%} a daughter, {%Damayantī%}, and three excellent sons,
{%Dama, Dānta%}, and {%Damana%}. Both {%Nala%} and {%Damayantī%} had
not their equals in beauty, and, continually hearing of each
other's virtues, they conceived attachment to each other,
though they had never seen each other. Once {%Nala%} in
his garden saw a number of golden-winged swans and
caught one of them, but let it loose, as it promised to
speak well of him before {%Damayantī%}. The swans having
arrived at the {%Vidarbha%} country, the one who had been
caught by {%Nala%} led {%Damayantī%} to a secluded spot and
fulfilled its mission. {%Damayantī%} caused it to speak to {%Nala%}
of her (III, {@53@}).—§ 345: As {%Damayantī%} became sick of
love, her father invited all the kings to her {%svayaṃvara%}.
At this time the {%ṛṣis%} of the gods {%Nārada%} and {%Parvata%},
having arrived in course of their wanderings at the regions
of {%Indra%}, told him that the kings did not now come to him
because they were intent on the {%svayaṃvara%} of {%Damayantī%}.
Hearing this, the {%Lokapālas%} set out on their vehicles for
the {%svayaṃvara%}, but seeing {%Nala%} on the way and filled with
astonishment at his beauty, they left their chariots in the
sky and asked {%Nala%} to be their messenger (III, {@54@}).
{%Nala%} promised to do so, but when {%Indra%} told him to go to
{%Damayantī%} and tell her that {%Indra, Agni, Varuṇa%}, and {%Yama%}
desired her to choose one of them for her lord, he asked
them to spare him as he had come with the same object;
but, as they insisted that he should stand by his promise,
he by their power entered without being perceived by the
guardians into the apartments of {%Damayantī%}, and, saying
his name, fulfilled his mission (III, {@55@}). {%Damayantī%}
declared that if she did not become the wife of {%Nala%} himself
she would resort to poison, or fire, or water, or the rope.
{%Nala%} advised her to choose one of the gods, maintaining
that having come in a different mission he dared not seek his
own interest. {%Damayantī%} then told him to come to her
{%svayaṃvara%} in company with the gods, then she would
choose him, at which no blame would be his, and {%Nala%}
returned to the {%Lokapālas%} and told them what had happened
(III, {@56@}). At the sacred hour of the holy lunar day of
the auspicious season {%Bhīma%} summoned the kings to the
{%svayaṃvara%}, and that assembly of kings resembled the
{%Bhogavatī%} swarming with {%Nāgas. Damayantī%}, beholding five
persons all alike in appearance, and recollecting the marks
of the celestials, of which she had heard from old people,
was unable to distinguish which of them was {%Nala%}. Filled
with grief, she then decided upon seeking the protection
of the gods themselves, and prevailed upon them that they
assumed their true shapes. Thereupon she beheld the
gods unmoistened with perspiration, with unwinking eyes and
unfading garlands, not stained with dust, and staying without
touching the ground, while {%Nala%} was revealed by his shadow,
his fading garlands, and by his being stained with dust and
sweat, and resting on the ground with winking eyes. She
then chose {%Nala%}, seizing the hem of his garment and placing
a floral wreath round his neck. {%Nala%} promised {%Damayantī%}
that he would remain hers as long as he lived, and she
spoke words of like import to him. The {%Lokapālas%} bestowed
each a couple of boons on {%Nala: Indra%}, that he should be
able to behold his divine nature in sacrifices, and blessed
regions thereafter ({%gatim anuttamāṃ); Agni%}, his own presence
wherever he wished and regions as bright as himself; {%Yama%},
subtle taste in food and pre-eminence in virtue; {%Varuṇa%},
water wherever he desired and garlands of celestial fragrance.
[Page500-b+ 63]
Then the gods went to heaven and the kings returned
home. {%Nala%}, after the wedding, stayed there for a time,
returned home, ruled righteously, and celebrated the horse-
sacrifice, etc. He begat the son {%Indrasena%} and the daughter
{%Indrasenā%} upon {%Damayantī%} (III, {@57@}).—§ 346: When the
{%Lokapālas%} were returning they met {%Dvāpara%} with {%Kali%} going
to the {%svayaṃvara%}, and {%Indra%} told {%Kali%} that {%Damayantī%} had
already chosen {%Nala%}. As {%Kali%} threatened to avenge himself
he was rebuked by the {%Lokapālas%}, as {%Nala%} had studied the
four {%Vedas%} with the {%Ākhyāna%} as the fifth, etc. When the gods
had gone to heaven, {%Kali%} said that he would take possession
of {%Nala%} and deprive him of his kingdom, and asked {%Dvāpara%}
to enter the dice (III, {@58@}). {%Kali%} then went to the country
of the {%Niṣadhas%} and always watched for an opportunity.
At last, in the twelfth year, when {%Nala%}, after answering
a call of nature, touching water had said his twilight prayers
without having washed his feet, {%Kali%} entered his person.
Then {%Kali%} becoming {%Vṛṣa%} ({%“vṛṣo gavāṃ,”%} the principal die,
Nīl.) (PCR. thinks we ought to read that “{%Dvāpara%} also
approached {%Puṣkara%} becoming {%Vṛṣa%}”) prevailed upon
{%Puṣkara%}, that he challenged {%Nala%} to a match of dice in
order to acquire his kingdom. {%Nala%} and {%Puṣkara%} gambled
together for many months, {%Nala%} being always worsted; no
one amongst his friends could succeed in dissuading him
from the play; at last they came in a body, which was
told by the {%sūta%} to {%Damayantī%}, who in vain represented
it to {%Nala%}; he uttered not a word in reply (III, {@59@}).
Seeing that {%Nala%} had lost everything, {%Damayantī%} told her
nurse and maidservant {%Bṛhatsenā%} to summon the councillors
in the name of {%Nala%} and tell them what had been lost;
the councillors approached {%Nala%}, and {%Damayantī%} informed
him that the citizens had come again in a body, but he
regarded her not. She then caused {%Bṛhatsenā%} to summon
the {%sūta Vārṣṇeya%}, who at her request yoked {%Nala's%}
favourite horses and brought her two children to {%Kuṇḍina%}
(the city of {%Bhīma%}, Nīl.). There he left the children, the
chariot, and the horses, and went to {%Ayodhyā%}, where he
entered the service of king {%Ṛtuparṇa%} (the king of {%Kośala%},
v. 2877) as a charioteer (III, {@60@}).—§ 347: At last, when
{%Puṣkara%} had won all {%Nala's%} wealth and his kingdom, he
proposed to him to stake {%Damayantī%}. But {%Nala%}, feeling
as if his heart would burst and gazing at {%Puṣkara%} in
anguish without speaking a word, took all the ornaments
off his body, and attired in a single piece of cloth left the
city accompanied by {%Damayantī%}. They stayed for three
nights in the outskirts of the city, living on water alone.
Nobody showed him hospitable regards, as {%Puṣkara%} had
proclaimed through the city that he that should show any
attention to {%Nala%} would be put to death. After many days
{%Nala%} saw some birds of golden hue and covered them with
his cloth in order to catch them, but they rose up to the
sky taking away that garment of his, and then told him
they were the dice that had come hither to take away
even his cloth. {%Nala%} proposed to {%Damayantī%} to leave
him, pointing out to her the roads to {%Avantī, Ṛkṣavat%},
{%Vindhya, Payoṣnī, Vidarbha, Kośala%} (C. {%Kośalāṃ%}, B. and
Bopp {%Kośalān%}), and the south. But she would not leave
him, but suggested that they should go to {%Vidarbha%} (III, {@61@}).
{%Nala%} refused to appear before {%Bhīma%} in his state of misery.
They went on attired in the same piece of cloth. Once
when {%Damayantī%} had fallen into a profound slumber in
a shed for travellers ({%sabhā), Nala%}, influenced by {%Kali%},
resolved upon deserting {%Damayantī%}, as separated from him
[Page501-a+ 63]
she might perchance wander to her relatives. With a sword
that he found near the shed he cut off one half of the
cloth and throwing the instrument away departed, having
first returned again and again, dragged away by {%Kali%}, but
drawn back by love (III, {@62@}). When {%Damayantī%} awoke,
she lamented and cursed the being through whose imprecation
{%Nala%} suffered woe, saying that it should lead a still more
miserable life. Thereupon, wandering on, she was seized
by a gigantic serpent and rescued by a hunter; as the
hunter, after comforting her, tried to force her to love
him, he was cursed by her and fell down lifeless upon the
ground (III, {@63@}). Description of the forest, {%Damayantī's%}
lamentations. She went in a northerly direction for three
days and nights, then she came to an asylum of ascetics,
who told her that she should again become happy together
with {%Nala%}. Then the asylum disappeared. Sometime after-
wards, having proceeded a long way, she met with a body of
merchants landing on the banks of a river; its leader was {%Śuci%}
(v. 2529, “so help us now, {%Maṇibhadra%}, the king of {%Yakṣas%}”),
and it was bound for the city of the {%Cedi%} king {%Subāhu%} (III,
{@64@}). {%Damayantī%} followed the caravan. Once, at midnight,
the caravan was destroyed by wild elephants and many men
were trodden to death, which some ascribed to their not
having worshipped {%Maṇibhadra%} or {%Vaiśvavaṇa%}, the kings of
{%Yakṣas%}, others to their having received {%Damayantī%}, whom
they thought to be a {%Rākṣasa%} or {%Piśāca%} or {%Yakṣa%} woman,
and resolved upon killing her when they saw her. Hearing
this {%Damayantī%} fled. The next day the remnant of the
caravan left the place. {%Damayantī%}, with the brahmans that
had survived the slaughter of the caravan, came towards
evening to the city of the {%Cedi%} king {%Subāhu%}. The boys
began to follow her; when she came before the palace of
the king, the queen-mother let the nurse take her in.
{%Damayantī%} agreed to stay there on the conditions that she
should not eat remnants, not wash anyone's feet, nor speak
with other men, but be protected against all aspirations.
The queen gave her as a {%sairindhrī%} to her daughter {%Sunandā%}
(III, {@65@}).—§ 348: {%Nala%}, having deserted {%Damayantī%}, saw
a conflagration in the forest and therefrom heard a voice
calling him by name and saw the {%Nāga Karkoṭaka%}, who
unable to stir, told him that he had deceived the great
ṛṣi {%Nārada%} and been cursed by him with the words: “Stay
thou here immobile until {%Nala%} takes thee hence, then
thou shalt be freed from my curse,” and asked him to deliver
him and promised to instruct him in respect of his welfare.
The snake then became as small as a thumb, and {%Nala%}
taking him up went to a spot free from fire. {%Karkoṭaka%}
let him proceed yet counting his steps, and bit him at the
tenth step ({%adaśad daśame pade%}) (see Nīl. and PCR.). Then
the form of {%Nala%} was changed, in order that people might
not recognize him, and {%Karkoṭaka%} assumed his own form,
and said that {%Kali%} dwelling in {%Nala%} should be tortured
by his venom, and that {%Nala%} should have no fear from
animals with fangs, from enemies, and from men versed in
the Veda ({%brahmavidbhyaḥ%}), and told him to go to {%Ayodhyā%}
and present himself as a {%sūta Bāhuka%} before {%Ṛtuparṇa%} (of the
race of {%Ikṣvāku%}), who would give {%Nala%} his skill in dice
({%akṣahṛdaya%}) in exchange for {%Nala's%} knowledge of horses
({%aśvahṛdaya%}), and when he had become an adept at dice he
should have prosperity and meet with his wife and children
and regain his kingdom. The {%Nāga%} king then gave {%Nala%}
two pieces of celestial cloth, saying that when he desired to
get back his own form he should remember him and wear
[Page501-b+ 63]
this garment. Then he disappeared (III, {@66@}).—§ 349:
On the tenth day {%Nala%} entered the city of {%Ṛtuparṇa%}; he
approached the king and named himself {%Bāhuka%}, and said
that he surpassed everybody in managing steeds and might be
consulted in matters of difficulty ({%arthakṛcchreṣu%}) and affairs
of skill ({%naipuṇeṣu%}), and that he was versed in the art
of cooking. Then he was appointed superintendent of
{%Ṛtuparṇa's%} horses on a pay of 10,000, and {%Vārṣṇeya%}
and {%Jīvala%} should be under his direction. Every evening
he recited the śloka, “Where lies that helpless one
({%tapasvinī%}) afflicted with hunger and thirst and worn
with toil ({%śrāntā%}), or upon whom does she now wait
({%upatiṣṭhati)?%}” Once {%Jīvala%} asked him who she was, and
{%Nala%} related to him the main features of his story without
naming her or himself (III, {@67@}).—§ 350: {%Bhīma%} sent
out brahmans in all directions to search for {%Nala%} and
{%Damayantī%}, promising 1,000 kine, etc., to him that should
find them. At length the brahman {%Sudeva%}, the friend of
{%Damayantī's%} brother, recognized {%Damayantī%} in the city of
the {%Cedis%}, seated with {%Sunandā%} during the time of the
king's prayers ({%puṇyāhavācane rājñaḥ%}), and told her who
he was and that her relatives and children were well.
Beholding {%Damayantī%} weeping and conversing in private
with {%Sudeva, Sunandā%} caused her mother to question {%Sudeva%}
(III, {@68@}). {%Sudeva%} told the story of {%Damayantī%}, and that he
had recognized her by a mole between her eyebrows, which
was now almost covered with dust as her whole body.
Then {%Sunandā%} washed away the dust and the queen-mother
recognized her by the mole as the daughter of her sister,
as she and {%Damayantī's%} mother were both daughters of the
{%Daśārṇa%} king {%Sudāman%}, and she herself had been bestowed
on {%Vīrabāhu%} and her sister on {%Bhīma%}; she had witnessed
{%Damayantī's%} birth in the palace of her father in the Daśārṇa
country. At her own request {%Damayantī%} was brought in
a litter carried by men and protected by a large escort to
the city of {%Bhīma%}, and was received with respect and
worshipped the gods and brahmans. {%Bhīma%} gave unto
{%Sudeva%} 1,000 kine, etc. The next day {%Damayantī%} let her
mother cause {%Bhīma%} to send brahmans out in all directions
to seek for {%Nala. Damayantī%} ordered them everywhere
to recite the {%ślokas%}: “O beloved gambler, where hast
thou gone, cutting off half of my garment,” etc., but to
take care that no one knew that it was on her command
(III, {@69@}).—§ 351: After a long time the brahman
{%Parṇāda%} told that he had in {%Ayodhyā%} visited {%Bhāṅgāsuri%}
(i.e. {%Ṛtuparṇa%}), and that {%Bāhuka%} had been affected by
hearing his {%śloka%}, and had said to him: “Chaste women,
though overtaken by calamity, yet protect themselves,” etc.
{%Damayantī%} then thanked {%Parṇāda%} and promised him great
wealth and consulted with her mother, and, without {%Bhīma's%}
knowing it, sent {%Sudeva%}, who told {%Ṛtuparṇa%} that to-morrow
{%Damayantī%} would hold another {%svayaṃvara%} (III, {@70@}).
When ordered by {%Ṛtuparṇa%} to conduct him to the {%svayaṃvara%}
of {%Damayantī, Bāhuka%} felt his heart bursting with grief, but
promised to go there in a single day; he yoked four horses
born in {%Sindhu%} (description of their marks), made {%Vārṣṇeya%}
sit on the chariot, and set out with so great speed that
{%Vārṣṇeya%} thought he must be {%Mātali%} or {%Śālihotra%}, who
had taken a human shape, or {%Nala%} (III, {@71@}).—§ 352:
As the chariot was coursing thus, {%Ṛtuparṇa%} lost his upper
garment, and {%Nala%} declared that it was impossible to
recover it, as they had already travelled one {%yojana%} thence.
As {%Ṛtuparṇa%} rightly indicated the number of fruits of
[Page502-a+ 63]
a {%vibhītaka-%}tree ({%Terminalia bellerica%}), and said he was skilled
in dice as in numbers, {%Nala%} prevailed upon him to teach him
the science and in future receive instead his science of
horses. Then {%Kali%} came out from the body of {%Nala%}, vomiting
the poison of {%Karkoṭaka%}, and assumed his own shape, as
the fire of {%Damayantī's%} curse had left him, but remained
invisible to others except {%Nala. Kali%} prevailed upon {%Nala%}
that he should not curse him, promising that those men
who would attentively recite his history should be free
from fear of him, and entered the {%vibhītaka-%}tree till {%Nala%}
had gone far away. Then {%Kali%} returned to his abode.
From the touch of {%Kali%} the {%vibhītaka-%}tree from that hour
fell into disrepute. {%Nala%} now became free from calamity,
though he did not assume his original form (III, {@72@}).—
§ 353: At night they arrived at {%Kuṇḍina%}, having passed
100 {%yojanas%}. The steeds of {%Nala%} that were in that city,
and peacocks and elephants and {%Damayantī%} recognized the
sound of {%Nala's%} chariot; {%Damayantī%} ascended the terrace
with the desire of seeing {%Nala%}. The {%Kośala%} king ({%Ṛtuparṇa%})
wondered, as he did not hear any talk of the {%svayaṃvara%},
etc., and {%Bhīma%} thought that he had come simply to pay
his respects. When {%Ṛtuparṇa%} had gone to his appointed
quarters with {%Vārṣṇeya%}, and {%Bāhuka%}, having tended the
horses, was sitting at the side of the chariot, {%Damayantī%}
sent a female messenger in search of {%Nala%} (III, {@73@}). The
female messenger {%Keśinī%} asked {%Bāhuka%} about {%Vārṣṇeya%}
and himself; he said that {%Vārṣṇeya%} was the charioteer of
{%Nala%}, that nobody knew {%Nala%} except {%Nala%} himself and
his wife, as he did not discover his marks of identity
anywhere, and that he himself was the charioteer and
cook of king {%Ṛtuparṇa%}; at last she repeated the {%śloka%} of
{%Parṇāda%}: “O beloved gambler,” etc., and said that
{%Damayantī%} wished again to hear the reply he had given
{%Parṇāda%}; then {%Bāhuka%}, weeping, said: “Chaste women,
though overtaken by calamity,” etc., and {%Keśinī%} went to
{%Damayantī%} and acquainted her with everything (III, {@74@}).
{%Damayantī%} again sent {%Keśinī%} to stay in silence at {%Bāhuka's%}
side and mark his conduct; she related that low passages
grew in height so that he might pass through them easily,
that when he approached narrow holes opened wide, that
only by his looking upon them the vessels became filled
with water, that when he held a handful of grass in the sun
the fire blazed up all of a sudden, that he touched fire
and was not hurt, that water falling at his will flowed
in a stream, and that flowers pressed with his hands became
gayer and more fragrant than before. {%Damayantī%} then caused
{%Keśinī%} without {%Bāhuka's%} knowledge to bring her some meat
that had been boiled and dressed by him, from the kitchen,
and recognized the taste. She then sent her two children
with {%Keśinī. Bāhuka%} embraced them crying aloud, saying
they were like his own children, and sent {%Keśinī%} away lest
people might think “evil” (III, {@75@}). Having obtained
the consent both of her father and mother, {%Damayantī%}
caused {%Nala%} to be brought to her apartments; it came to
an explication; {%Damayantī%} declared that she had feigned
to hold a second {%svayaṃvara%} because no one except {%Nala%}
could in one day manage 100 {%yojanas%} with horses, and swore
by the Air, Sun, and Moon (“who dwells as a witness within
every creature,” v. 2989), who had been her protector for
these three years, and {%Vāyu%} bore witness to the truth of
her words. Then a floral shower fell there, and the celestial
kettledrum began to play. {%Nala%} then wore the garment
he had received from the serpent king and regained his
[Page502-b+ 63]
old form. Thus {%Nala%} in the fourth year was reunited
with his wife (III, {@76@}). The next day they presented
themselves before {%Bhīma%}. The citizens were in great joy
and adorned ({%arcitāni%}) the temples ({%devatāyatanāni%}), etc.
{%Ṛtuparṇa%} asked {%Nala's%} forgiveness, and {%Nala%} also asked
{%Ṛtuparṇa's%} forgiveness, and made over to him his horse-
lore, having obtained from him the mystery of dice. Then
{%Ṛtuparṇa%} went away to his own city, employing another
person as his charioteer (III, {@77@}).—§ 354: Having dwelt
for a month at {%Kuṇḍina, Nala%} set out for the {%Niṣadha%}
country with a single white chariot, sixteen elephants, fifty
horses, and 600 infantry, and proposed to {%Puṣkara%} that
they should gamble again, as {%Nala%} had won great wealth;
the stake should be {%Damayantī%}, wealth and kingdom,
and their lives; if not, he proposed a single combat.
{%Puṣkara%}, hoping to win {%Damayantī%}, whom he loved,
gladly consented to gamble, and lost at a single throw.
{%Nala%}, declaring that it was {%Kali%} who had done it all,
forgave his brother and granted him his portion, and after
a month let him go to his own town. All the citizens
and subjects rejoiced at {%Nala's%} return (III, {@78@}). Then {%Nala%}
with a large force brought {%Damayantī%} and his children home,
and passed his days in joy and performed numerous sacrifices
with abundant gifts to brahmans.—§ 355: “So thou also,
O {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, wilt blaze forth in effulgence soon. They
that will repeatedly recite this history of {%Nala%} and they
that will hear it recited will never be touched by adversity.”
As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} feared that some one skilled in dice
might summon him, {%Bṛhadaśva%} taught him the science of
dice ({%akṣahṛdaya%}) and then went to {%Aśvaśiras%} for a bathe.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then learnt from brahmans and ascetics from
various directions that {%Arjuna%} was still engaged in ascetic
penances, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} grieved for him (III, {@79@}).
