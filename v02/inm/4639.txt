[{@Indralokābhigamanaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating
to Arjuna's journey to the world of Indra,” the 34th of the
minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 335: After the {%Lokapālas%}
had gone away, {%Arjuna%} began to think of the chariot of
{%Indra%}, which, guided by {%Mātali%}, came down full of swords,
missiles, maces, thunderbolts, etc. (description), and great
{%Nāgas%} with fiery mouths, and drawn by 10,000 horses of
golden hue, and with the flagstaff {%Vaijayanta%} (described).
{%Mātali%}, descending, invited him to ascend the chariot, as {%Indra%}
waited to behold him, surrounded by gods, {%ṛṣis, Gandharvas%},
and {%Apsarases%}. As that chariot cannot be obtained even by
hundreds of {%rājasūyas%} and horse-sacrifices, and as even gods
and {%Dānavas%} are not competent to ride in it, and as he that
has no ascetic merit is not competent even to see or touch
it, {%Arjuna%} first let {%Mātali%} ascend it and control the horses.
Then he purified himself in the {%Gaṅgā%}, repeated his prayers
({%japyaṃ%}), gratified the {%Pitṛs%}, and bade farewell to the
{%Mandara%} mountain ({%b%}). Then he ascended, in the chariot,
through the sky and beheld thousands of {%vimānas%} of extra-
ordinary beauty; there was no sun or moon or fire, but they
blazed in light of their own, generated by virtue and ascetic
merit; and the stars, which from earth look small in con-
sequence of their distance, but are very large, were seen by
him in their places; and {%rājarṣis%} who had attained {%siddhi%}
({%siddhāḥ%}), and heroes fallen in battle, and those that had
obtained heaven by {%tapas%}; and {%Gandharvas%}, and {%Guhyakas%},
and {%ṛṣis%}, and {%Apsarases. Mātali%} explained to him that the
stars were virtuous persons ({%sukṛtinaḥ%}) stationed in their
respective places ({%dhiṣṇyeṣu%}). At the gates he beheld
{%Airāvata%} with four tusks equal to {%Kailāsa%}. Continuing along
the path of the {%Siddhas%}, he passed through the regions ({%lokān%})
of [virtuous] kings, and thus passing through {%Svargaloka%} he
beheld {%Amarāvatī(b%}), the city of {%Indra%} (III, {@42@}).—§ 336:
When {%Arjuna%} had entered the city, praised by {%Apsarases%},
{%Gandharvas, Siddhas%}, great {%ṛṣis%}, and gods, he, at the
request of {%Indra%}, went to the large starry way ({%nakṣatra-%}
{%mārga%}) named {%Suravīthī%}, where he met with the {%Sādhyas%},
{%Viśvas, Maruts, Aśvins, Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, Brahmarṣis%},
{%Rājarṣis%} with {%Dilīpa%} at their head, {%Tumburu, Nārada%},
{%Hāhā%}, and {%Hūhū%}. Then he beheld {%Indra%}, eulogized by
{%Gandharvas%} headed by {%Viśvāvasu%}, etc., and was seated on
{%Indra's%} own seat; and {%Gandharvas%}, headed by {%Tumburu%}, sang
to them, and thousands of {%Apsarases%} (enumeration of seventeen)
(<lang n="greek">α</lang>) danced there (III, {@43@}).—§ 337: The gods and {%Gandharvas%}
offered him {%arghya%}, etc., and caused him to enter the palace
[Page342-b+ 63]
of {%Indra%}. There he received {%Indra's%} weapons, the thunder-
bolt ({%vajra%}) and lightning ({%aśanīḥ%}). At the request of {%Indra%}
he dwelt there for five years, and learned the dance and
music of the {%Gandharvas%} from {%Citrasena%}, whom {%Indra%} gave
him as a friend, but he was longing for his brothers and
{%Kuntī%} and thirsting for revenge (III, {@44@}).—§ 338: In the
beginning, seeing that the eyes of {%Arjuna%} were fixed upon
{%Urvaśī, Indra%} despatched {%Citrasena%} to {%Urvaśī%}, who gladly
consented to choose {%Arjuna (b%}) for her lover (III, {@45@}).
{%Urvaśī%} related to {%Arjuna%} that as he had looked on her only
in a solemn assembly of celestials held on account of his
coming, where the {%Rudras, Ādityas, Aśvins, Vasus, Maharṣis%},
{%Rājarṣis, Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Yakṣas%}, and {%Mahoragas%}
(i.e. great serpents) were present, and the {%Gandharvas%}
played the {%vīṇās%}, and the {%Apsarases%} danced, {%Indra%} had caused
{%Citrasena%} to send her to him, and that she was herself in
love with him. {%Arjuna%} declared that he regarded her as
the wife of his {%guru%}, and that he had been gazing at her
because she was the mother of the {%Paurava%} race. She
replied that the sons and grandsons of {%Pūru's%} race, that had
come thither in consequence of ascetic merit, did all sport
with the {%Apsarases%} without incurring any sin. But {%Arjuna%}
swore that he regarded her as his mother. She then cursed
him, saying that he should have to pass his time among
females as a dancer and destitute of manhood, and then went
away. {%Indra%} told him that this would come to pass in the
thirteenth year of their exile, when they would live unknown
to all, but having passed one year thus he would regain his
manhood. The desire of the man that listens to this history
of {%Arjuna%} never runs after lustful ends, etc. (III, {@46@}).—
§ 339: One day the {%brahmarṣi Lomaśa%} in the course of his
wanderings went to the abode of {%Indra%}. As {%Lomaśa%} within
himself wondered how {%Arjuna%}, being a {%kṣatriya%}, had attained
the seat of {%Śakra%}, who was worshipped by the gods themselves,
{%Śakra%}, knowing his thoughts, explained to him who {%Arjuna%}
({%b%}) really was; that moreover the {%Asuras%}, the sons of {%Danu%},
named the {%Nivātakavacas%}, who dwell in {%Pātāla%}, proud of
a boon they had acquired, were planning the destruction of
the gods, and could not be slain by others than either {%Kṛṣṇa%}
({%c%}) or {%Arjuna%}; but {%Madhusūdana%} (i.e. Kṛṣṇa) should not be
urged when the task was insignificant, lest his energy should
consume the whole universe; therefore {%Arjuna%} should slay
them. At the request of {%Indra%}, seconded by {%Arjuna, Lomaśa%}
went to the {%Kāmyaka%} wood to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in order to bring
him news about {%Arjuna%} and recommend him to visit the
{%tīrthas%}, and follow him and protect him from the {%Rākṣasas%}
({%d%}) (III, {@47@}).—§ 340: As {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} learnt from {%Dvaipā-%}
{%yana%} of {%Arjuna's%} arrival and stay at {%Indra's%} abode, he expressed
his anxiety to {%Sañjaya%} (III, {@48@}). Conversation of {%Sañjaya%}
and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} about {%Arjuna's%} encounter with {%Śiva%} in the
guise of a {%Kirāta%}, etc. (III, {@49@}).—§ 341: During the five
years of {%Arjuna's%} absence the {%Pāṇḍavas%} fed themselves and
10,000 {%snātaka%} brahmans, some with and some without fire,
by killing deer, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} going towards the east, {%Bhīma%}
towards the south, and the twins towards the west and north
(III, {@50@}).—§ 342: Having heard of the way of life of the
{%Pāṇḍavas, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} expressed his anxiety before {%Sañjaya%},
fearing {%Bhīma%} with his iron ({%śaikya%}) mace, etc. {%Sañjaya%}
commemorated how {%Kṛṣṇa, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa, Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%ketu%}, and the {%Kaikeyas%} had visited the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in the
{%Kāmyaka%} wood, whose conversations {%Sañjaya%} had learnt
through spies and formerly told {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%}
further related that {%Kṛṣṇa%} had consented to become the
[Page343-a+ 63]
charioteer of {%Arjuna%} (enumeration of kings seen by {%Kṛṣṇa%}
at the {%rājasūya%}) and to assist the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in the battle,
together with {%Rāma, Akrūra, Gada, Śāmba, Pradyumna%},
{%Āhuka, Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, and the son of {%Śiśupāla%}, and {%Yuyu-%}
{%dhāna%}, and the {%Kaikeya%} and {%Pāñcāla%} princes and the {%Matsya%}
king, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} had declared that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should,
along with his brothers living at {%Hāstinapura%}, rule the earth
(III, {@51@}).
