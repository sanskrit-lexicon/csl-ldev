[{@Indralokābhigamanaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating
<div n="lb">to Arjuna's journey to the world of Indra,” the 34th of the
<div n="lb">minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 335: After the {%Lokapālas%}
<div n="lb">had gone away, {%Arjuna%} began to think of the chariot of
<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} which, guided by {%Mātali,%} came down full of swords,
<div n="lb">missiles, maces, thunderbolts, etc. (description), and great
<div n="lb">{%Nāgas%} with fiery mouths, and drawn by 10,000 horses of
<div n="lb">golden hue, and with the flagstaff {%Vaijayanta%} (described).
<div n="lb">{%Mātali,%} descending, invited him to ascend the chariot, as {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">waited to behold him, surrounded by gods, {%ṛṣis, Gandharvas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Apsarases.%} As that chariot cannot be obtained even by
<div n="lb">hundreds of {%rājasūyas%} and horse-sacrifices, and as even gods
<div n="lb">and {%Dānavas%} are not competent to ride in it, and as he that
<div n="lb">has no ascetic merit is not competent even to see or touch
<div n="lb">it, {%Arjuna%} first let {%Mātali%} ascend it and control the horses.
<div n="lb">Then he purified himself in the {%Gaṅgā,%} repeated his prayers
<div n="lb">{%(japyaṃ),%} gratified the {%Pitṛs,%} and bade farewell to the
<div n="lb">{%Mandara%} mountain {%(b).%} Then he ascended, in the chariot,
<div n="lb">through the sky and beheld thousands of {%vimānas%} of extra-
<div n="lb">ordinary beauty; there was no sun or moon or fire, but they
<div n="lb">blazed in light of their own, generated by virtue and ascetic
<div n="lb">merit; and the stars, which from earth look small in con-
<div n="lb">sequence of their distance, but are very large, were seen by
<div n="lb">him in their places; and {%rājarṣis%} who had attained {%siddhi%}
<div n="lb">{%(siddhāḥ),%} and heroes fallen in battle, and those that had
<div n="lb">obtained heaven by {%tapas;%} and {%Gandharvas,%} and {%Guhyakas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%ṛṣis,%} and {%Apsarases. Mātali%} explained to him that the
<div n="lb">stars were virtuous persons {%(sukṛtinaḥ)%} stationed in their
<div n="lb">respective places {%(dhiṣṇyeṣu).%} At the gates he beheld
<div n="lb">{%Airāvata%} with four tusks equal to {%Kailāsa.%} Continuing along
<div n="lb">the path of the {%Siddhas,%} he passed through the regions {%(lokān)%}
<div n="lb">of [virtuous] kings, and thus passing through {%Svargaloka%} he
<div n="lb">beheld {%Amarāvatī(b),%} the city of {%Indra%} (III, {@42@}).—§ 336:
<div n="lb">When {%Arjuna%} had entered the city, praised by {%Apsarases,%}
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas, Siddhas,%} great {%ṛṣis,%} and gods, he, at the
<div n="lb">request of {%Indra,%} went to the large starry way {%(nakṣatra-%}
<div n="lb">{%mārga)%} named {%Suravīthī,%} where he met with the {%Sādhyas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Viśvas, Maruts, Aśvins, Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, Brahmarṣis,%}
<div n="lb">{%Rājarṣis%} with {%Dilīpa%} at their head, {%Tumburu, Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">{%Hāhā,%} and {%Hūhū.%} Then he beheld {%Indra,%} eulogized by
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas%} headed by {%Viśvāvasu,%} etc., and was seated on
<div n="lb">{%Indra's%} own seat; and {%Gandharvas,%} headed by {%Tumburu,%} sang
<div n="lb">to them, and thousands of {%Apsarases%} (enumeration of seventeen)
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) danced there (III, {@43@}).—§ 337: The gods and {%Gandharvas%}
<div n="lb">offered him {%arghya,%} etc., and caused him to enter the palace
[Page342-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">of {%Indra.%} There he received {%Indra's%} weapons, the thunder-
<div n="lb">bolt {%(vajra)%} and lightning {%(aśanīḥ).%} At the request of {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">he dwelt there for five years, and learned the dance and
<div n="lb">music of the {%Gandharvas%} from {%Citrasena,%} whom {%Indra%} gave
<div n="lb">him as a friend, but he was longing for his brothers and
<div n="lb">{%Kuntī%} and thirsting for revenge (III, {@44@}).—§ 338: In the
<div n="lb">beginning, seeing that the eyes of {%Arjuna%} were fixed upon
<div n="lb">{%Urvaśī, Indra%} despatched {%Citrasena%} to {%Urvaśī,%} who gladly
<div n="lb">consented to choose {%Arjuna (b)%} for her lover (III, {@45@}).
<div n="lb">{%Urvaśī%} related to {%Arjuna%} that as he had looked on her only
<div n="lb">in a solemn assembly of celestials held on account of his
<div n="lb">coming, where the {%Rudras, Ādityas, Aśvins, Vasus, Maharṣis,%}
<div n="lb">{%Rājarṣis, Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Yakṣas,%} and {%Mahoragas%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. great serpents) were present, and the {%Gandharvas%}
<div n="lb">played the {%vīṇās,%} and the {%Apsarases%} danced, {%Indra%} had caused
<div n="lb">{%Citrasena%} to send her to him, and that she was herself in
<div n="lb">love with him. {%Arjuna%} declared that he regarded her as
<div n="lb">the wife of his {%guru,%} and that he had been gazing at her
<div n="lb">because she was the mother of the {%Paurava%} race. She
<div n="lb">replied that the sons and grandsons of {%Pūru's%} race, that had
<div n="lb">come thither in consequence of ascetic merit, did all sport
<div n="lb">with the {%Apsarases%} without incurring any sin. But {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">swore that he regarded her as his mother. She then cursed
<div n="lb">him, saying that he should have to pass his time among
<div n="lb">females as a dancer and destitute of manhood, and then went
<div n="lb">away. {%Indra%} told him that this would come to pass in the
<div n="lb">thirteenth year of their exile, when they would live unknown
<div n="lb">to all, but having passed one year thus he would regain his
<div n="lb">manhood. The desire of the man that listens to this history
<div n="lb">of {%Arjuna%} never runs after lustful ends, etc. (III, {@46@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 339: One day the {%brahmarṣi Lomaśa%} in the course of his
<div n="lb">wanderings went to the abode of {%Indra.%} As {%Lomaśa%} within
<div n="lb">himself wondered how {%Arjuna,%} being a {%kṣatriya,%} had attained
<div n="lb">the seat of {%Śakra,%} who was worshipped by the gods themselves,
<div n="lb">{%Śakra,%} knowing his thoughts, explained to him who {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">{%(b)%} really was; that moreover the {%Asuras,%} the sons of {%Danu,%}
<div n="lb">named the {%Nivātakavacas,%} who dwell in {%Pātāla,%} proud of
<div n="lb">a boon they had acquired, were planning the destruction of
<div n="lb">the gods, and could not be slain by others than either {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%(c)%} or {%Arjuna;%} but {%Madhusūdana%} (i.e. Kṛṣṇa) should not be
<div n="lb">urged when the task was insignificant, lest his energy should
<div n="lb">consume the whole universe; therefore {%Arjuna%} should slay
<div n="lb">them. At the request of {%Indra,%} seconded by {%Arjuna, Lomaśa%}
<div n="lb">went to the {%Kāmyaka%} wood to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in order to bring
<div n="lb">him news about {%Arjuna%} and recommend him to visit the
<div n="lb">{%tīrthas,%} and follow him and protect him from the {%Rākṣasas%}
<div n="lb">{%(d)%} (III, {@47@}).—§ 340: As {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} learnt from {%Dvaipā-%}
<div n="lb">{%yana%} of {%Arjuna's%} arrival and stay at {%Indra's%} abode, he expressed
<div n="lb">his anxiety to {%Sañjaya%} (III, {@48@}). Conversation of {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} about {%Arjuna's%} encounter with {%Śiva%} in the
<div n="lb">guise of a {%Kirāta,%} etc. (III, {@49@}).—§ 341: During the five
<div n="lb">years of {%Arjuna's%} absence the {%Pāṇḍavas%} fed themselves and
<div n="lb">10,000 {%snātaka%} brahmans, some with and some without fire,
<div n="lb">by killing deer, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} going towards the east, {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">towards the south, and the twins towards the west and north
<div n="lb">(III, {@50@}).—§ 342: Having heard of the way of life of the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} expressed his anxiety before {%Sañjaya,%}
<div n="lb">fearing {%Bhīma%} with his iron {%(śaikya)%} mace, etc. {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">commemorated how {%Kṛṣṇa, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa, Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%ketu,%} and the {%Kaikeyas%} had visited the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in the
<div n="lb">{%Kāmyaka%} wood, whose conversations {%Sañjaya%} had learnt
<div n="lb">through spies and formerly told {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">further related that {%Kṛṣṇa%} had consented to become the
[Page343-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">charioteer of {%Arjuna%} (enumeration of kings seen by {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">at the {%rājasūya%}) and to assist the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in the battle,
<div n="lb">together with {%Rāma, Akrūra, Gada, Śāmba, Pradyumna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Āhuka, Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} and the son of {%Śiśupāla,%} and {%Yuyu-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhāna,%} and the {%Kaikeya%} and {%Pāñcāla%} princes and the {%Matsya%}
<div n="lb">king, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} had declared that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should,
<div n="lb">along with his brothers living at {%Hāstinapura,%} rule the earth
<div n="lb">(III, {@51@}).
