{@Cākṣuṣā,@}¦ a Gandharvic science given to Arjuna by
<div n="lb">Citraratha. § 221 (Caitrarathap.): I, {@170,@} 6478.—§ 221{%b%}
<div n="lb">(Caitrarathap.): {%C.%} had been communicated by {%Manu%} to {%Soma,%}
<div n="lb">by {%Soma%} to {%Viśvāvasu,%} and by {%Viśvāvasu%} to {%Citraratha%} after
<div n="lb">ascetic penances, and when communicated by the preceptor to
<div n="lb">a man without energy, it becomes fruitless. By means of it
<div n="lb">one may see whatever one wishes. One can acquire it only
<div n="lb">by standing on one leg for six months; but {%Arjuna%} obtained it
<div n="lb">without any rigid vow. This knowledge makes the {%Gandharvas%}
<div n="lb">superior to men and equal to the gods.
