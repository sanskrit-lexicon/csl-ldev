[{@Sarasvatī-Tārkṣya-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“conversation
between Sarasvatī and Tārkṣya”). § 456 (Mārk.): {%Mārkaṇ-%}
{%ḍeya%} related how {%Sarasvatī%} instructed {%Tārkṣya%} about the
celestial regions, and especially about the efficiency of different
presents to {%brahmans%}. Then she spoke of the {%agnihotra%}; she
said she had come from the {%agnihotra%} to clear away the
doubts of the {%brahmarṣis%}, and that she was nourished by
sacrifice. {%Tārkṣya%} asked her about the salvation ({%mokṣa%})
taught by {%Sāṅkhya%} and {%Yoga%}; she again mentioned the {%Vedic%}
sacrifice; [this (v. 12732—12745) is wanting in PCR.]
(III, {@186@}).
