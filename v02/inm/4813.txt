{@[Jarāsandhavadhaparvan]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
killing of Jarāsandha,” the 23rd of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.; cf. Jarāsandhavadha). § 276: As {%Kṛṣṇa%} thought
that {%Jarāsandha%} was incapable of being vanquished in battle
even by all the gods and {%Asuras%}, but might be vanquished in
a personal struggle with bare arms ({%prāṇayuddha%}, PCR.), and
as there was in himself policy, in {%Bhīma%} strength, and in
{%Arjuna%} ability to protect them, he thought that {%Jarāsandha%}
should be made to challenge {%Bhīma%}, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} therefore
obtained the permission of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that {%Bhīma%} and
{%Arjuna%} followed him. They set out in the garb of {%snātakas%},
with {%Bhīma%} in the van, from the land of the {%Kurus%} to the
{%Padmasaras%}, over {%Kālakūṭa, Gaṇḍakī, Mahāśoṇa, Sadānīrā%}
(v. 794 runs thus in V.: {%Gaṇḍakīñca Sadānīrāṃ Śarkarā-%}
{%varttam eva ca%}), the rivers on the {%Ekaparvataka%} (? see
BR.) and {%Pūrvā%} (i.e. Eastern) {%Kośalā%} (B. has {%pūrvāṃś ca%}
{%Kośalān%}), {%Mithilā, Mālā, Carmaṇvatī, Gaṅgā, Śoṇa%}, towards
the east, dressed in garments of {%kuśa%}-grass (instead of
{%kuśacīracchadā%} V. has {%Kuśāmboraḥsthalaṃ%}), to the {%Māgadha%}
land. When they came to the mountain of {%Goratha%}, they
beheld the {%Māgadha%} town (II, {@20@}).—§ 277: {%Girivraja%} is
[Page355-a+ 63]
surrounded by the five large hills of {%Vaihāra, Varāha%},
{%Vṛṣabha, Ṛṣigiri%}, and {%Caityaka%}. It was there that {%Gautama%}
begat {%Kākṣīvat%}, etc., upon the {%śūdra%} woman {%Auśīnarī%}, and
was visited by the kings of {%Aṅga, Vaṅga%}, etc. There dwell
the {%Nāgas Arbuda, Śakravāpin, Svastika%}, and {%Maṇināga%}.
{%Manu%} had ordered the {%Māgadhas%} never to be afflicted with
drought; {%Kauśika%} and {%Maṇimat%} had favoured the country.
The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} entered the city by breaking down
the peak of {%Caityaka%}, worshipped by the {%Bārhadrathas%} and
the citizens with perfumes and flower garlands, where
{%Bṛhadratha%} had slain the cannibal {%Ṛṣabha%}, and made of
his hide ({%māsatālābhiḥ%}, see BR.; Gauḍapāṭha: {%māṃsanālābhiḥ%},
Nīl.) three drums [which the brothers broke, v. 814, not
in V.]. As evil omens had been seen, the {%purohitas%} made
{%Jarāsandha%} mount an elephant and carried fire about him
({%paryagnyakurvan%}), and he entered upon ({%dīkṣitaḥ%}) a sacrifice
with vows ({%niyamasthaḥ%}) and fasts ({%upavāsaparaḥ). Kṛṣṇa%},
{%Bhīma%}, and {%Dhanañjaya%} entered the city without weapons
in the guise of {%snātakas%}, snatched from the flower-vendors
the garlands they had exposed for sale, and attired in robes
of various colours and decked with garlands and ear-rings they
entered the abode of {%Jarāsandha%}, who welcomed them, and
hearing from {%Kṛṣṇa%} that {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} in consequence
of a vow would not speak before night, quartered them in the
sacrificial apartments ({%yajñāgāre%}) and retired to the palace
({%rājagṛhaṃ%}). At midnight he came to them, as he always
observed the vow, that as soon as he should hear of the
arrival of {%snātakas%}, even at midnight, he would immediately
come out and grant them an audience. As he questioned
them about their strange attire, which was unsuitable
for {%snātakas%}, and their breaking down the {%Caityaka%} peak,
and why they would not accept the worship he offered,
{%Kṛṣṇa%} gave him some explanations (v. 848 ff.: {%snātaka-%}
{%vratino, rājan ! brāhmaṇā, kṣatriyā, viśaḥ|viśeṣaniyamāś%}
{%caiṣām aviśeṣāś ca santy uta | viśeṣavāṃś ca satataṃ kṣat-%}
{%triyaḥ śriyam ṛcchati%}), and declared that they had come as his
foes (II, {@21@}). As {%Jarāsandha%} said that he did not remember
to have injured them, {%Kṛṣṇa%} told him that they were
sent by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to set at liberty the princes whom
{%Jarāsandha%} intended to slaughter as a sacrifice to {%Śiva%}, because
sacrificing human beings to the gods was never used (v. 864);
he reminded him of the destruction of {%Dambhodbhava, Kārta-%}
{%vīrya, Uttara%}, and {%Bṛhadratha%}, and challenged him to set
free the monarchs or to fight. {%Jarāsandha%} chose to fight, and
ordered {%Sahadeva%}, to be installed on the throne. Then he
thought of his generals {%Kauśika%} and {%Citrasena%}, who had
formerly been {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka. Kṛṣṇa%}, remembering
that, according to the command of {%Brahmán, Jarāsandha%} was
not to be slain by him or by the {%Madhus%}, did not himself desire
to slay him (II, {@22@}). {%Jarāsandha%} having chosen to fight with
{%Bhīma%}, the {%purohita%} brought pigment, garlands, etc., and
propitiatory ceremonies ({%kṛtasvastyayanaḥ%}) were performed by
a brahman; and likewise {%Bhīma%}, having consulted with {%Kṛṣṇa%},
had propitiatory ceremonies pronounced ({%kṛtasvastyayanaḥ%}).
When {%Jarāsandha%} had taken off his crown and arranged
his hair, they fought with their clenched fists as their only
weapons. The combat began at the first day of the month
{%Kārttika%}, and lasted, without intermission or food, till the
thirteenth; on the fourteenth night {%Jarāsandha%} desisted from
fatigue, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} obscurely intimated that he should now
be killed (II, {@23@}). At the instigation of {%Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma%}
threw {%Jarāsandha%} into the air a hundred times, pressed his
knee against his backbone and broke his body in two with
[Page355-b+ 63]
a terrible roar, so that the citizens became dumb with terror
and many women were prematurely delivered. Leaving the
lifeless body at the palace gate, they went out of the town
riding on {%Jarāsandha's%} celestial chariot, which {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused
to be made ready, it being adorned with a celestial flagstaff
and incapable of being vanquished by any king, upon which
{%Indra%} and {%Viṣṇu%} had fought in the battle about {%Tārakā%},
riding upon which {%Indra%} had slain ninety-nine ({%navatīr nava%})
{%Dānavas%}, which had been obtained by king {%Vasu%} from {%Vāsava%}
(i.e. Indra), from {%Vasu%} by {%Bṛhadratha%}, and from him by
{%Jarāsandha%}. And {%Kṛṣṇa%} thought of {%Garuḍa%}, who sat upon
the chariot along with the frightfully roaring creatures on its
flagstaff. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then released his relatives and ordered
them to assist {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at his {%rājasūya%}. Stopping on
a level plain outside the town, he was adored by the citizens,
and he installed {%Sahadeva%}, the son of {%Jarāsandha%}, in the
sovereignty of the {%Magadhas%}. Then they arrived at {%Indra-%}
{%prastha%}. Thereupon {%Kṛṣṇa%}, having taken leave of {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, etc., set out for his own city, riding upon that same
celestial chariot that had been given to him by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} having circumambulated him ({%pradakṣiṇam%}
{%akurvanta%}) (II, {@24@})
