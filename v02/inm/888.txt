{@Aṣṭāvakrīya(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to Aṣṭāvakra”).
—§ 51 (Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2@}, 449: {%A. atraiva vivādo yatra%}
{%Bandinā%}, etc.—§ 412 (Tīrthay.): III, {@132@} ff.: {%Uddālaka%}
gave his own daughter {%Sujātā%} in marriage, together with
sacred learning ({%śrutaṃ%}), to his disciple the brahman {%Kahoda%},
who had served him long. The embryo in her womb had
become versed in the {%Śāstras%} and the {%Vedas%} with the {%aṅgas%},
and blamed {%Kahoda%}, who had been reading the whole night.
The great {%ṛṣi Kahoda%} cursed him to become crooked on
eight parts of his body, wherefore he, when born, was
called {%Aṣṭāvakra%}. In order to procure wealth for {%Sujātā%},
{%Kahoda%} went to king {%Janaka%} (son of {%Indradyumna%}, v. {@133@},
10624), where he was defeated in a controversy with the
{%sūta%} (v. 10613, etc., {%sūtaputram%} v. 10671) {%Bandin%} and was
immersed into water. {%Uddālaka%} prevailed upon {%Sujātā%} to
keep it a secret from {%Aṣṭāvakra%}, who regarded {%Uddālaka%}
as his father and {%Śvetaketu%}, the son of {%Uddālaka%}, who was
of the same age with himself, as his brother, until in his
12th year {%Śvetaketu%} in anger happened to disclose the
matter to him. He and {%Śvetaketu%} then went to the sacrifice
of {%Janaka%}, and on being driven from the entrance {%Aṣṭāvakra%}
met the king (III, {@132@}), and in the course of a conversation
with him and the doorkeeper he compared {%Janaka%} to {%Yayāti%},
and said that he had heard that {%Bandin%} caused those whom
he had vanquished in disputation to be drowned in the sea
by men sent by {%Janaka%}, and he declared that he had come to
maintain the unity with {%Bráhman (Brahmādvaitam%}) and to
defeat {%Bandin%}; then he answered several enigmatical questions
(about the wheel of Time, the thunder and lightning, the
fish, egg, stone, and river) and was admitted (III, {@133@}).
Here they disputed in such a way that {%Bandin%} enumerated
things of which there is only 1 (fire, Sun, {%Indra%}, and {%Yama%}),
{%Aṣṭāvakra%} groups of 2 ({%Indra%} and {%Agni%}, 2 devarṣis:
{%Nārada%} and {%Parvata%}, 2 {%Aśvins%}, 2 wheels of a chariot;
husband and wife), {%Ba°%} of 3 (3 times the creatures are born,
etc.; see Nīl.), {%A°%} of 4 (4 are the {%āśramas%} of the {%brahmans%};
4 orders perform this sacrifice(!), etc.), {%Ba°%} of 5 (5 fires, etc.),
{%A°%} of 6 (6 cows, it is asserted by some, are the {%dakṣiṇā%}
for establishing the sacred fire, {%“ādhāne,”%} etc.), {%Ba°%} of 7
(7 domesticated animals, 7 wild animals, etc.), {%A°%} of 8 (8 {%śāṇas%}
make a {%śatamāna%}, see BR., 8 are the legs of the {%śarabha%},
etc.), {%Ba°%} of 9 (9 are the {%sāmidhenī%} verses for the {%Pitṛs%}, etc.),
{%A°%} of 10 (10 are the cardinal points, etc.), {%Ba°%} of 11 (11 are
the {%ekādaśinas%} of the creatures, see Nīl., 11 are there the
{%yūpas%}, etc.), {%A°%} of 12 (12 months, etc.). As {%Bandin%} had said
the first half-{%śloka%} with 13 (the 13th {%tithi%} is deemed most
auspicious, 13 are the islands of the earth), he stopped, and
{%Aṣṭāvakra%} fulfilled the {%śloka. Bandin%} was then deemed to be
vanquished, and at the request of {%Aṣṭāvakra%} he merged into
the sea, after he had declared himself to be the son of {%Varuṇa%}
and that he had caused the {%brahmans%} to be drowned in order
that they might see the twelve years {%sattra%} of {%Varuṇa%} that
was performed simultaneously with that of {%Janaka%}. They
at once reappeared, and {%Kahoda%} let {%Aṣṭāvakra%} bathe in the
river {%Samaṅgā%}, and all his limbs were immediately made
straight, and the {%Samaṅgā%} became a remover of sin. “There-
fore you also should bathe there” (III, {@134@}).
