<div n="lb">{%tīrtha%} the seven Ṛ. had, on one occasion, left {%Arundhatī%}
<div n="lb">while they went to {%Himavat%} in order to gather fruits and
<div n="lb">roots. A drought occurred extending for twelve years; the Ṛ.,
<div n="lb">having made an asylum for themselves, continued to live
<div n="lb">there in a forest of {%Himavat.%} Seeing {%Arundhatī%} devoted to
<div n="lb">penances, {%Śiva%} in the form of a brahman came to her and
<div n="lb">asked for alms, and, as her store of food was exhausted, he
<div n="lb">told her to cook jujubes. While she listened to his discourses
<div n="lb">and cooked, without food, that twelve years' drought passed
<div n="lb">away to her as if it were a single day. Then the seven Ṛ.
<div n="lb">returned; {%Mahādeva,%} in his own form, said that the ascetic
<div n="lb">merit of {%Arundhatī%} was much greater than theirs, and granted
<div n="lb">her the boon that this spot should become an excellent {%tīrtha%}
<div n="lb">named Badarapācana, resorted to by Si. and D.-ṛ., and that he
<div n="lb">who observes a fast there and resides there for three nights after
<div n="lb">having cleansed himself should obtain the benefit of a twelve
<div n="lb">years' fast. Then he repaired to heaven. Ṛ. wondered at the
<div n="lb">sight of the god and because {%Arundhatī%} was unfatigued and still
<div n="lb">possessed the hue of health: 2795, 2798, 2805, 2810, 2814,
