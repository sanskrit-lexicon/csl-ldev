{@233@}{%b%}, 8456: {%A%}. became jealous of Vasiṣṭha, one of the
seven ṛṣis, etc.; in consequence of this her presumption

was the only one of the wives of the seven ṛṣis whose form
Svāhā was unable to assume, as a consequence of her ascetic

(was invoked by Droṇa to bless Duryodhana).—§ 615{%z%} (Badara-
pācana): IX, {@48@}: {%Indra%} related to {%Śrutāvatī%}: In this very
{%tīrtha%} the seven Ṛ. had, on one occasion, left {%Arundhatī%}
while they went to {%Himavat%} in order to gather fruits and
roots. A drought occurred extending for twelve years; the Ṛ.,
having made an asylum for themselves, continued to live
there in a forest of {%Himavat%}. Seeing {%Arundhatī%} devoted to
penances, {%Śiva%} in the form of a brahman came to her and
asked for alms, and, as her store of food was exhausted, he
told her to cook jujubes. While she listened to his discourses
and cooked, without food, that twelve years' drought passed
away to her as if it were a single day. Then the seven Ṛ.
returned; {%Mahādeva%}, in his own form, said that the ascetic
merit of {%Arundhatī%} was much greater than theirs, and granted
her the boon that this spot should become an excellent {%tīrtha%}
named Badarapācana, resorted to by Si. and D.-ṛ., and that he
who observes a fast there and resides there for three nights after
having cleansed himself should obtain the benefit of a twelve
years' fast. Then he repaired to heaven. Ṛ. wondered at the
sight of the god and because {%Arundhatī%} was unfatigued and still
possessed the hue of health: 2795, 2798, 2805, 2810, 2814,
2815, 2818.—§ 707 (Mokṣadh.): XII, {@318@}, 11711 (one

Dharma; Brahmán granted her that her penances would
continually increase.
