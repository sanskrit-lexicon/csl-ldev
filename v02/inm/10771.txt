[{@Tapaty-upākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Tapatī”). § 222 (Caitrarathap.). {%Arjuna%} asked why he had
called him {%Tāpatya%}, and {%Citraratha%} said: “{%Sūrya%} had a
lovely daughter {%Tapatī%}, the younger sister of {%Sāvitrī. Ṛkṣa's%}
son, the king {%Saṃvaraṇa%}, duly worshipped {%Sūrya%}; to him
{%Sūrya-%} resolved to bestow his daughter. Once, when
{%Saṃvaraṇa%} went on a hunting expedition, his steed died
from fatigue on the mountain, and he began to wander on
foot and saw {%Tapatī%} alone, and declared her his love. She did
not speak a word, but disappeared. He wandered through
the whole forest in search of her, and failing to find her,
indulged in lamentations (I, {@171@}). He fell down on the
earth. Then she appeared again. He asked her to marry
him according to the {%Gāndharva%} form of marriage. She said
that she loved him, but told him to ask her father {%Āditya%} for
her hand, with worship, ascetic penances, and vows (I, {@172@}).
{%Tapatī%} then ascended to the skies, and {%Saṃvaraṇa%} again fell
down on the earth. At last his followers found him, and his
minister raised him up and sprinkled his head with water,
etc. Regaining his consciousness, {%Saṃvaraṇa%} sent away all
his attendants with the exception of his minister alone, and
then began to worship {%Sūrya%}. He also thought of his
{%purohita%}, the {%ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha%}. After the king had stayed
thus on the same spot day and night, the {%Viprarṣi Vasiṣṭha%}
came there on the 12th day. {%Vasiṣṭha%} knew at once, by his
ascetic power, what had happened and ascended to the sky in
order to see {%Sūrya%}, and asked him to give {%Tapatī%} to {%Saṃvaraṇa%}.
{%Saṃvaraṇa%}, with due rites, took {%Tapatī's%} hand on that
mountain resorted to by the gods and the {%Gandharvas%}. And
the king caused {%Vasiṣṭha%} to be proclaimed his regent in his
capital and kingdom, etc., and sported with his wife in the
woods on that mountain for twelve years. Now {%Indra%} for
twelve years poured no rain in his capital and kingdom. Then
{%Vasiṣṭha%} brought {%Saṃvaraṇa%} and his wife back into the city,
and then {%Indra%} poured rain in abundance. {%Saṃvaraṇa%}, with
{%Tapatī%}, performed sacrifices for twelve years. Their son was
{%Kuru%}, the ancestor of {%Arjuna%} (I, {@173@}).
