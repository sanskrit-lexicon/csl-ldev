[{@Tapaty-upākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Tapatī”). § 222 (Caitrarathap.). {%Arjuna%} asked why he had
<div n="lb">called him {%Tāpatya,%} and {%Citraratha%} said: “{%Sūrya%} had a
<div n="lb">lovely daughter {%Tapatī,%} the younger sister of {%Sāvitrī. Ṛkṣa's%}
<div n="lb">son, the king {%Saṃvaraṇa,%} duly worshipped {%Sūrya;%} to him
<div n="lb">{%Sūrya-%} resolved to bestow his daughter. Once, when
<div n="lb">{%Saṃvaraṇa%} went on a hunting expedition, his steed died
<div n="lb">from fatigue on the mountain, and he began to wander on
<div n="lb">foot and saw {%Tapatī%} alone, and declared her his love. She did
<div n="lb">not speak a word, but disappeared. He wandered through
<div n="lb">the whole forest in search of her, and failing to find her,
<div n="lb">indulged in lamentations (I, {@171@}). He fell down on the
<div n="lb">earth. Then she appeared again. He asked her to marry
<div n="lb">him according to the {%Gāndharva%} form of marriage. She said
<div n="lb">that she loved him, but told him to ask her father {%Āditya%} for
<div n="lb">her hand, with worship, ascetic penances, and vows (I, {@172@}).
<div n="lb">{%Tapatī%} then ascended to the skies, and {%Saṃvaraṇa%} again fell
<div n="lb">down on the earth. At last his followers found him, and his
<div n="lb">minister raised him up and sprinkled his head with water,
<div n="lb">etc. Regaining his consciousness, {%Saṃvaraṇa%} sent away all
<div n="lb">his attendants with the exception of his minister alone, and
<div n="lb">then began to worship {%Sūrya.%} He also thought of his
<div n="lb">{%purohita,%} the {%ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha.%} After the king had stayed
<div n="lb">thus on the same spot day and night, the {%Viprarṣi Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">came there on the 12th day. {%Vasiṣṭha%} knew at once, by his
<div n="lb">ascetic power, what had happened and ascended to the sky in
<div n="lb">order to see {%Sūrya,%} and asked him to give {%Tapatī%} to {%Saṃvaraṇa.%}
<div n="lb">{%Saṃvaraṇa,%} with due rites, took {%Tapatī's%} hand on that
<div n="lb">mountain resorted to by the gods and the {%Gandharvas.%} And
<div n="lb">the king caused {%Vasiṣṭha%} to be proclaimed his regent in his
<div n="lb">capital and kingdom, etc., and sported with his wife in the
<div n="lb">woods on that mountain for twelve years. Now {%Indra%} for
<div n="lb">twelve years poured no rain in his capital and kingdom. Then
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha%} brought {%Saṃvaraṇa%} and his wife back into the city,
<div n="lb">and then {%Indra%} poured rain in abundance. {%Saṃvaraṇa,%} with
<div n="lb">{%Tapatī,%} performed sacrifices for twelve years. Their son was
<div n="lb">{%Kuru,%} the ancestor of {%Arjuna%} (I, {@173@}).
