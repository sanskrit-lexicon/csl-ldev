§ 402{%c%} (Tīrthayātrāp.): The river {%P%}. was adorned (? {%upacitāṃ%})
[Page549-b+ 63]
by the Vidarbha king, and its waters were mixed with
{%soma%} juice (see Nīl.); III, {@120@}, †10289 (visited by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, etc., on his {%tīrthayātrā%}), †10290.—§ 403{%b%} (do.):
Here (i.e. on the river {%P%}.) king {%Nṛga%} gratified {%Indra%} by
offering {%soma%}. Here the gods with {%Indra%} and the {%Prajāpatis%}
performed sacrifices. Here king {%Gaya Āmūrtarāyasa%} satisfied
{%Indra%} with {%soma%} in seven horse-sacrifices, where all the
articles, which else are made of wood or earth, were of gold.
Seven sets of these articles were prepared by him, and at the
top of each sacrificial stake seven rings were fastened; the
gods themselves with {%Indra%} erected the sacrificial stakes.
{%Indra%} became delighted with {%soma%} and the brahmans with
the {%dakṣiṇās%}, which were innumerable as the sand-grains,
the stars, or the raindrops. {%Gaya%} presented the brahmans
with golden cows (otherwise PCR.) made by {%Viśvakarman%},
so numerous were his caityas that but little space was left
on the earth. Thus {%Gaya%} attained to the worlds of {%Indra%}
({%lokān…Aindrān%}); he who bathes in the {%P%}. attains to
the same: III, {@121@}, 10304.—§ 403 (do.): III, {@121@}, 10306
