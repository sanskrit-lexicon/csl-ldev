“Aditi cooked food for the gods, hoping that, having eaten it,

‘Give me alms’; she, saying that it was only to be eaten by
the gods, gave him nothing, wherefore he cursed her, saying
that she would have a pain—{%vyathā%}—in her womb; in the
second birth—as an egg—of Vivasvat, the egg of his mother
Aditi was killed” (so B.); therefore Vivasvat Śrāddhadeva
