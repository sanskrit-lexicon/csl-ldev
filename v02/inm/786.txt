[{@Arghāharaṇaparvan@}]¦ (“on the handing over of the
<div n="lb">gift of honour,” the 26th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
<div n="lb">§ 289: On the {%abhiṣecanīya%} day {%maharṣis%} and {%Nārāda%}
<div n="lb">entered the {%antarvedi%} and sat down together with the {%rājarṣis%}
<div n="lb">engaged in various topics of conversation and dispute. No
<div n="lb">{%śūdra%} was then near the {%antarvedi,%} nor anybody without vows
[Page067-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%(avratin). Nārada%} sat there with feelings of awe, remembering
<div n="lb">the words he had heard of old in the mansion of Brahmán
<div n="lb">regarding the incarnation of the deities, and knowing
<div n="lb">that {%Kṛṣṇa%} was the incarnation of {%Nārāyaṇa%} and would
<div n="lb">himself destroy all these assembled {%kṣattriyas. Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">then proposed to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that {%arghas%} should be offered
<div n="lb">to the kings, and first to him who was the foremost. As
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} declared {%Kṛṣṇa%} to be foremost, he caused {%Sahadeva%}
<div n="lb">to present the first {%argha%} to {%Kṛṣṇa,%} which filled the {%Cedi%}
<div n="lb">king {%Śiśupāla%} with envy (II, {@36@}). {%Śiśupāla%} gravely
<div n="lb">censures {%Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (saying that
<div n="lb">he was a servant and cowherd and no king, and speaking
<div n="lb">depreciatingly of his exploits), and accompanied by the
<div n="lb">kings left the assembly (II, {@37@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ran after
<div n="lb">{%Śiśupāla%} and spoke sweetly to him in order to conciliate
<div n="lb">him; {%Bhīṣma%} maintained the fitness of giving {%Kṛṣṇa%} the
<div n="lb">first {%argha%} (II, {@38@}). {%Sāhadeva%} and {%Nārada%} declared it to
<div n="lb">be highly improper not to worship {%Kṛṣṇa. Sunītha%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Śiśupāla%}) stirred the kings up in order to obstruct the
<div n="lb">completion of the sacrifice (II, {@39@}).
