[{@Jatugṛhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the lac-house,”
<div n="lb">the 8th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Jatuveśmā-
<div n="lb">khya[ṃ parva].) § 213: {%Vaiśampāyana%} briefly related the
<div n="lb">plan of {%Saubala, Duryodhana, Duḥśāsana, Karṇa,%} and {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra%} to burn the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kuntī%} in a lac-house, and
<div n="lb">their escape. Asked by {%Janamejaya,%} he then began to relate
<div n="lb">it more fully. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} frustrated all the plans of
<div n="lb">murdering them laid by {%Duryodhana,%} etc., without speaking
<div n="lb">of them, in obedience to the counsels of {%Vidura.%} People
<div n="lb">began to speak in all public places of installing {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
[Page357-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">on the throne instead of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Duryodhana%} repre-
<div n="lb">sented to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that this would for ever exclude
<div n="lb">himself and his brothers from the throne (I, {@141@}). {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana, Karṇa, Śakuni,%} and {%Duḥśāsana%} held a consultation
<div n="lb">together, and {%Duryodhana%} prevailed upon {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">to exile the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to {%Vāraṇāvata%} (“{%Aśvatthāman%} is on
<div n="lb">my side; with him follow {%Droṇa%} and {%Kṛpa; Vidura%} is
<div n="lb">dependent on us for his means of life, though he is covertly
<div n="lb">with the foe”) (I, {@142@}). {%Duryodhana%} and his brothers began
<div n="lb">gradually to win over the people to their side by grants of
<div n="lb">wealth and honours, while {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} suggested to the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} to visit the festival of {%Paśupati%} at {%Vāraṇāvata.%}
<div n="lb">Fully understanding the motives of {%Dhṛtarāṣtra, Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">let {%Bhīṣma, Vidura, Droṇa, Bāhlīka, Somadatta, Kṛpa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman, Bhūriśravas, Gāndhārī,%} etc., give them their
<div n="lb">benedictions, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} having performed propitiatory
<div n="lb">rites in order to obtain the kingdom, set out for {%Vāraṇāvata%}
<div n="lb">(I, {@143@}). {%Duryodhana%} prevailed upon {%Purocana%} to reach
<div n="lb">{%Vāraṇāvata%} that very day upon a swift chariot, and to
<div n="lb">construct a house of inflammable materials and burn the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kuntī%} (I, {@144@}). The people, who were
<div n="lb">distressed by the departure of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and angry with
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} were calmed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura,%} in
<div n="lb">obscure words (cf. {%Mlecchavācā,%} v. 5803), warned {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">who explained the meaning to {%Kuntī.%} They set out on the
<div n="lb">8th day of the month of {%Phālguna%} when {%Rohiṇī%} was ascendant
<div n="lb">(I, {@145@}). They were received with great honours by the
<div n="lb">citizens of {%Vāraṇāvata%} and installed by {%Purocana%} first in
<div n="lb">a palace that had been built for them, and after ten days
<div n="lb">in the lac-house called {%Śiva (Śivākhyaṃ). Yudhiṣṭhira%} scented
<div n="lb">the smell of fat, etc., and told it to {%Bhīma,%} but resolved
<div n="lb">to seem unsuspicious (I, {@146@}). A miner, sent by {%Vidura,%}
<div n="lb">told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that {%Purocana%} would put fire to the house
<div n="lb">on the fourteenth night of the dark lunation, and made a large
<div n="lb">subterranean passage (I, {@147@}). They lived there for a year.
<div n="lb">Then on a certain night {%Kuntī%} fed a large number of {%brahmans;%}
<div n="lb">and there came also a {%Niṣāda%} woman with her five sons, who
<div n="lb">became intoxicated and lay down in the house to sleep. The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} then set fire to the house and burnt {%Purocana%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Niṣādas,%} while they themselves escaped through the
<div n="lb">subterranean passage and fled in haste, {%Bhīma%} carrying his
<div n="lb">mother and brothers (cf. III, v. 546 foll.). The citizens
<div n="lb">thought they had been burnt to death (I, {@148@}). A person
<div n="lb">sent by {%Vidura%} took the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kuntī%} to the other
<div n="lb">side of the {%Gaṅgā%} in a boat (I, {@149@}). The miner had
<div n="lb">covered the hole he had dug with ashes, and the towns-
<div n="lb">people thought that the {%Niṣāda%} woman with her five sons
<div n="lb">were {%Kuntī%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and sent to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">to inform him that they had been burnt to death together
<div n="lb">with {%Purocana. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wept in deep sorrow, and
<div n="lb">caused the funeral rites to be performed. Meanwhile the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} having crossed the {%Gaṅgā%} proceeded in the darkness
<div n="lb">to the south and reached a dense forest. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then
<div n="lb">prevailed upon {%Bhīma%} to carry {%Kuntī%} and his brothers
<div n="lb">(I, {@150@}). The motion of {%Bhīma's%} legs raised a wind like
<div n="lb">that of the months of {%Śuci%} and {%Śukra,%} while he trod down
<div n="lb">the trees and swam across streams. Towards evening they
<div n="lb">sat down in a terrible forest under a banyan-tree. {%Kuntī%}
<div n="lb">was thirsty, and {%Bhīma%} proceeded to a pool at a distance of
<div n="lb">a {%gavyūti,%} and brought water by soaking his upper garments.
<div n="lb">When he found them sleeping from fatigue, he lamented that
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would not yet allow him to slay {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">etc., and sat there awake keeping watch over them (I, {@151@}).
