[{@Jatugṛhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the lac-house,”
the 8th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Jatuveśmā-
khya[ṃ parva].) § 213: {%Vaiśampāyana%} briefly related the
plan of {%Saubala, Duryodhana, Duḥśāsana, Karṇa%}, and {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%} to burn the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kuntī%} in a lac-house, and
their escape. Asked by {%Janamejaya%}, he then began to relate
it more fully. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} frustrated all the plans of
murdering them laid by {%Duryodhana%}, etc., without speaking
of them, in obedience to the counsels of {%Vidura%}. People
began to speak in all public places of installing {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
[Page357-a+ 63]
on the throne instead of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Duryodhana%} repre-
sented to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that this would for ever exclude
himself and his brothers from the throne (I, {@141@}). {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana, Karṇa, Śakuni%}, and {%Duḥśāsana%} held a consultation
together, and {%Duryodhana%} prevailed upon {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
to exile the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to {%Vāraṇāvata%} (“{%Aśvatthāman%} is on
my side; with him follow {%Droṇa%} and {%Kṛpa; Vidura%} is
dependent on us for his means of life, though he is covertly
with the foe”) (I, {@142@}). {%Duryodhana%} and his brothers began
gradually to win over the people to their side by grants of
wealth and honours, while {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} suggested to the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} to visit the festival of {%Paśupati%} at {%Vāraṇāvata%}.
Fully understanding the motives of {%Dhṛtarāṣtra, Yudhiṣṭhira%}
let {%Bhīṣma, Vidura, Droṇa, Bāhlīka, Somadatta, Kṛpa%},
{%Aśvatthāman, Bhūriśravas, Gāndhārī%}, etc., give them their
benedictions, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} having performed propitiatory
rites in order to obtain the kingdom, set out for {%Vāraṇāvata%}
(I, {@143@}). {%Duryodhana%} prevailed upon {%Purocana%} to reach
{%Vāraṇāvata%} that very day upon a swift chariot, and to
construct a house of inflammable materials and burn the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kuntī%} (I, {@144@}). The people, who were
distressed by the departure of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and angry with
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, were calmed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura%}, in
obscure words (cf. {%Mlecchavācā%}, v. 5803), warned {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
who explained the meaning to {%Kuntī%}. They set out on the
8th day of the month of {%Phālguna%} when {%Rohiṇī%} was ascendant
(I, {@145@}). They were received with great honours by the
citizens of {%Vāraṇāvata%} and installed by {%Purocana%} first in
a palace that had been built for them, and after ten days
in the lac-house called {%Śiva (Śivākhyaṃ). Yudhiṣṭhira%} scented
the smell of fat, etc., and told it to {%Bhīma%}, but resolved
to seem unsuspicious (I, {@146@}). A miner, sent by {%Vidura%},
told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that {%Purocana%} would put fire to the house
on the fourteenth night of the dark lunation, and made a large
subterranean passage (I, {@147@}). They lived there for a year.
Then on a certain night {%Kuntī%} fed a large number of {%brahmans%};
and there came also a {%Niṣāda%} woman with her five sons, who
became intoxicated and lay down in the house to sleep. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} then set fire to the house and burnt {%Purocana%} and
the {%Niṣādas%}, while they themselves escaped through the
subterranean passage and fled in haste, {%Bhīma%} carrying his
mother and brothers (cf. III, v. 546 foll.). The citizens
thought they had been burnt to death (I, {@148@}). A person
sent by {%Vidura%} took the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kuntī%} to the other
side of the {%Gaṅgā%} in a boat (I, {@149@}). The miner had
covered the hole he had dug with ashes, and the towns-
people thought that the {%Niṣāda%} woman with her five sons
were {%Kuntī%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and sent to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
to inform him that they had been burnt to death together
with {%Purocana. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wept in deep sorrow, and
caused the funeral rites to be performed. Meanwhile the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} having crossed the {%Gaṅgā%} proceeded in the darkness
to the south and reached a dense forest. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then
prevailed upon {%Bhīma%} to carry {%Kuntī%} and his brothers
(I, {@150@}). The motion of {%Bhīma's%} legs raised a wind like
that of the months of {%Śuci%} and {%Śukra%}, while he trod down
the trees and swam across streams. Towards evening they
sat down in a terrible forest under a banyan-tree. {%Kuntī%}
was thirsty, and {%Bhīma%} proceeded to a pool at a distance of
a {%gavyūti%}, and brought water by soaking his upper garments.
When he found them sleeping from fatigue, he lamented that
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would not yet allow him to slay {%Duryodhana%},
etc., and sat there awake keeping watch over them (I, {@151@}).
