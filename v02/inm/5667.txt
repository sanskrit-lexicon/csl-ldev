§ 643{%b%} (Āpaddh.): There was a robber {%Kāyavya%}, born of
a {%Kṣatriya%} father and a {%Niṣāda%} mother. {%K%}. was a practiser
of {%kṣatriya%} duties, conversant with the scriptures, free
from cruelty, devoted to the {%brahmans%}, etc. Morning and
evening he went deer-hunting; he was well conversant with
all the practices of the {%Niṣādas%}, and of all animals living
in the forest, etc. Alone he could vanquish many hundreds
of soldiers. He worshipped his old, blind, and deaf parents
in the forest every day, etc. One day many thousands of
robbers made him their leader, promising not to slay women,
{%brahmans%}, etc. By abstaining from sin they obtained great
prosperity. {%Kāyavya%}, though a robber, still succeeded in
winning felicity in heaven* (XII, {@135@}).
