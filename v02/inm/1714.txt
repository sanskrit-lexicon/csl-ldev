{@Brahmadatta-Pūjanī-Saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“conversation
<div n="lb">between Br. and P.”). § 647{%b%}: XII, {@139:@} {%As Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">had said that from trust great danger arose to kings
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣthira%} asked: “But how would the king maintain
[Page155-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">himself if he were not to trust anybody?” {%Bhīṣma%} related:
<div n="lb">A bird named {%Pūjanī%} lived with king {%Brahmadatta%} in his
<div n="lb">palace at {%Kāmpilya;%} like [the bird] {%Jīvajīvaka,%} it could
<div n="lb">mimic the cries of all animals {%(rutajñā sarvabhūtānāṃ),%} etc.
<div n="lb">At one and the same time P. got an offspring and the king
<div n="lb">a son. P. used every day to go to the shores of the ocean and
<div n="lb">bring a couple of fruits, one for her own child and one for the
<div n="lb">prince. One day the prince, when playing with the offspring
<div n="lb">of P., killed it, and then came back to his nurse. When
<div n="lb">P. had returned to the palace, she wept bitterly, and said
<div n="lb">that nobody should live with a kṣattriya or make friends
<div n="lb">with him; for so long as it suits their purpose, they behave
<div n="lb">with courtesy; but then they throw off the instrument; they
<div n="lb">do evil to all, and should never be trusted; even after doing
<div n="lb">an injury they try to soothe. P. then pierced the eyes of the
<div n="lb">prince, saying that those who avenge an injury never lose
<div n="lb">their merit by such conduct. Thinking that the avenger only
<div n="lb">squares his account, Br. sought to prevail upon P. to remain;
<div n="lb">“even after a deadly injury, affection and mutual trust arise
<div n="lb">between two persons residing together (for instance, the {%śvapaca%}
<div n="lb">[{%cāṇḍāla,%} PCR.] and the dog); animosity disappears quickly,
<div n="lb">like water poured upon the leaf of a lotus; it is Time that
<div n="lb">does every act; who therefore injures whom? Like fire con-
<div n="lb">suming the fuel, Time consumes all creatures; what thou
<div n="lb">hast done, has been forgiven by me, do thou also forgive me.”
<div n="lb">P. maintained that the injurer ought to leave his old place
<div n="lb">and never to place his trust upon the injured; just as the
<div n="lb">fragments of an earthen vessel cannot be reunited; animosity
<div n="lb">destroys the very sons and grandsons, and thereby the parties
<div n="lb">lose the next world as well; animosity can never die; it lies
<div n="lb">hidden like fire in wood, or like the water-fire ({%toyāgniḥ,%}
<div n="lb">i.e. the Aurva-fire) in the ocean; amongst men that have
<div n="lb">injured one another, therefore, mistrust alone can produce
<div n="lb">happiness; nor should too much trust be placed upon a person
<div n="lb">deserving of trust; one should try to inspire others with
<div n="lb">confidence in one's self, but never repose confidence in others
<div n="lb">(not even in a wife, son, brother, or friend); the mind of
<div n="lb">a person who has once injured another becomes naturally
<div n="lb">filled with mistrust if he sees the injured person worshipping
<div n="lb">him with gifts and honours. Hostility springs from five causes:
<div n="lb">woman, land, [harsh] words, natural incompatibility ({%sāpatna,%}
<div n="lb">i.e. {%jāti-vairaṃ,%} [as] that between the cat and the mouse,
<div n="lb">Nīl.), and injury; if Time be the cause of all acts, why
<div n="lb">do friends and kinsmen seek to avenge each other? further,
<div n="lb">why did the gods and the Asuras, in days of yore, smite
<div n="lb">each other in battle? and what use would there be of
<div n="lb">medicines? and how could religious merit be acquired by
<div n="lb">persons performing religious acts {%(kasmād dharmo 'sti kartṛṣu)?%}
<div n="lb">Men wish for birds either [to kill them] for food or [to
<div n="lb">keep them in cages] for sport. Misery arises from various
<div n="lb">sources (decrepitude, loss of wealth, association with something
<div n="lb">disagreeable, separation from agreeable objects, death {%[badha],%}
<div n="lb">immurement {%[bandha],%} women, natural causes {%[sahajaṃ],%}
<div n="lb">[especially the death of] a son; foolish persons say that
<div n="lb">there is no misery in others' misery; but one that knows
<div n="lb">the flavour of all [sorts of] misery {%(rasajñaḥ sarvaduḥkhasya),%}
<div n="lb">feels the misery of others as his own; [we have this] decision
<div n="lb">in [our] own practical scriptures, and [according to them]
<div n="lb">trust is productive of misery ({%niścayah svārthaśāstreṣu, viśvāsaś%}
<div n="lb">{%cāsukhodayaḥ;%} ought we not to read {%°yaś cārtha°?%}), and Uśanas
<div n="lb">did formerly quote two verses {%(gāthe)%} [to this effect] to
<div n="lb">Prahlāda {%(b);%} those who trust [the word], true or false, of a foe,
<div n="lb">are killed by trusting {%(śraddadhānās)%} like [a seeker of] honey
[Page155-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">by dry grass; having conceived {%(upagṛhya)%} hostilities [people]
<div n="lb">soothe [their foe], then they dash upon him like a full jar upon
<div n="lb">stone; if a king does injury to anyone, he should never trust
<div n="lb">him again. As Br. objected that by mere mistrust one does
<div n="lb">not obtain his desires, but is like a dead person, P. maintained
<div n="lb">that it is necessary not to act without an eye to the
<div n="lb">consequences (for instance, of sore feet, sore eyes, a wicked
<div n="lb">path, want of rain, injurious food); destiny and exertion
<div n="lb">are depending upon each other {%(daivaṃ puruṣakāraś ca%}
<div n="lb">{%sthitāv anyonyasaṃśrayāt);%} but those that are high-minded
<div n="lb">achieve good feats, while eunuchs only pay court to Destiny;
<div n="lb">knowledge, courage, cleverness, strength, and patience are
<div n="lb">one's natural {%(sahajāni)%} friends; house, precious metals
<div n="lb">{%(kupyaṃ),%} land {%(kṣetraṃ),%} wife, and friends are secondary
<div n="lb">{%(upahitāni)%} and may be obtained everywhere; home-keeping
<div n="lb">persons {%(gṛhasnehāvabaddhānāṃ)%} of little understanding are
<div n="lb">eaten up by a bad wife like the crab by her progeny ({%mā-%}
<div n="lb">{%ghamāṃ segavā%}—C. {%śe°—iva,%} 89 = 5222, v. Nīl.); one should
<div n="lb">put a distance between oneself and a bad wife, a bad son, a bad
<div n="lb">king, a bad friend, a bad alliance {%(ku-sambandhaṃ),%} and a bad
<div n="lb">country; she only is a wife who speaks what is agreeable;
<div n="lb">he is a son who makes his sire happy; he is a friend in
<div n="lb">whom one can trust; that is one's country where one earns
<div n="lb">one's living; he is a king of strict rule who does not oppress,
<div n="lb">etc. (95—96 = 5229—5230); the king is the root of the triple
<div n="lb">aggregate ({%trivargasya,%} i.e. Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure);
<div n="lb">while taking from his subjects a sixth share of their wealth,
<div n="lb">he should protect them all; otherwise he is a thief, and
<div n="lb">takes upon himself the sins of all his subjects, and ultimately
<div n="lb">sinks into Hell {%(nirayaṃ prayāti);%} the king, on the other
<div n="lb">hand, who gives protection is said by the Prajāpati {%Manu%}
<div n="lb">to have seven attributes {%(guṇān):%} he is a father (by
<div n="lb">compassion; the man who does not behave rightly towards
<div n="lb">him takes birth [in the next life] as an animal—{%tiryag%}
<div n="lb">{%gacchati%}), a mother (by doing good to his subjects—{%sam-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhāvayati%}—and by cherishing the poor—{%dīnam apy upapadyate%}),
<div n="lb">a preceptor {%(guru)%} (by giving instruction in morality and
<div n="lb">virtue—{%dharmopadeśena%}), a protector, fire (by scorching the
<div n="lb">wicked—{%aniṣṭān%}), {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e. Kubera) (by making
<div n="lb">gifts of wealth to those that are dear to him—{%iṣṭeṣu%}), and
<div n="lb">{%Yama%} (by restraining the sinful—{%yamayann asataḥ%}) {%(c);%} that
<div n="lb">king, whose subjects grow like a large lotus in a lake, obtains
<div n="lb">every reward [here] and meets with honour in Heaven
<div n="lb">{%(Svargaloke mahīyate).%}—Then P. took leave of Br. and pro-
<div n="lb">ceeded to the region she chose.
