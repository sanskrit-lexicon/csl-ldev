{@Nara-Nārāyaṇau.@}¦ § 561{%d%} (Yānasandhip.): Once {%Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">and {%Uśanas%} went to {%Brahmán,%} and also the {%Maruts%} with
<div n="lb">Indra, the {%Vasus%} with {%Agni,%} the {%Ādityas,%} the {%Sādhyas,%} the
<div n="lb">seven ṛṣis {%(saptarṣayaḥ),%} the {%Gandharva Viśvāvasu,%} the
<div n="lb">{%guṇas%} of Apsarases, and having bowed down to Brahmán
<div n="lb">they sat around him. Just then the two ancient deities
<div n="lb">{%(pūrvadevau),%} the Ṛṣis {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa,%} left the place.
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} said to {%Brahmán:%} “Who are these two that leave
<div n="lb">the place without worshipping thee?” Brahmán said that
<div n="lb">they were {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} who had come from the world
<div n="lb">of men to the world of {%Brahmán%} (so Nīl.); “worshipped by
<div n="lb">the gods and the {%Gandharvas%} they exist only for the destruction
<div n="lb">of the Asuras.” Indra went to the spot where those two
<div n="lb">were practising austerities, accompanied by all the gods
<div n="lb">headed by {%Bṛhaspati.%} At that time the gods had been very
<div n="lb">much alarmed in consequence of a war with the {%Asuras.%}
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} obtained the boon that {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} (i.e. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kṛṣṇa%}) assisted him in the battle (cf. Arjuna). Both
[Page508-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">of them, by their acts, enjoy numerous eternal and celestial
<div n="lb">regions, and are repeatedly born in the times of war. Even
<div n="lb">this is what {%Nārada,%} conversant with the {%Vedas,%} had said to
<div n="lb">the Vṛṣṇis.
