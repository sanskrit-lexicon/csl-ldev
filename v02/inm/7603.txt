{@Nara-Nārāyaṇau@}.¦ § 561{%d%} (Yānasandhip.): Once {%Bṛhaspati%}
and {%Uśanas%} went to {%Brahmán%}, and also the {%Maruts%} with
Indra, the {%Vasus%} with {%Agni%}, the {%Ādityas%}, the {%Sādhyas%}, the
seven ṛṣis ({%saptarṣayaḥ%}), the {%Gandharva Viśvāvasu%}, the
{%guṇas%} of Apsarases, and having bowed down to Brahmán
they sat around him. Just then the two ancient deities
({%pūrvadevau%}), the Ṛṣis {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}, left the place.
{%Bṛhaspati%} said to {%Brahmán%}: “Who are these two that leave
the place without worshipping thee?” Brahmán said that
they were {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} who had come from the world
of men to the world of {%Brahmán%} (so Nīl.); “worshipped by
the gods and the {%Gandharvas%} they exist only for the destruction
of the Asuras.” Indra went to the spot where those two
were practising austerities, accompanied by all the gods
headed by {%Bṛhaspati%}. At that time the gods had been very
much alarmed in consequence of a war with the {%Asuras%}.
{%Indra%} obtained the boon that {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} (i.e. {%Arjuna%}
and {%Kṛṣṇa%}) assisted him in the battle (cf. Arjuna). Both
[Page508-b+ 63]
of them, by their acts, enjoy numerous eternal and celestial
regions, and are repeatedly born in the times of war. Even
this is what {%Nārada%}, conversant with the {%Vedas%}, had said to
the Vṛṣṇis.
