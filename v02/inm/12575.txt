[{@Yānasandhiparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“section relating to the
<div n="lb">Yānasandhi”, q.v.), the 60th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.
<div n="lb">§ 561. After the night had passed away, all the princes and
<div n="lb">chiefs, {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) entered the court-hall (description)
<div n="lb">to hear the message of {%Sañjaya%} (adorned with ear-rings), who
<div n="lb">had come back from the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by the aid of {%Saindhava%}
<div n="lb">steeds. {%Sañjaya%} related the salutations of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (V,
<div n="lb">{@47@}). {%Sañjaya%} related that {%Arjuna%} (! cf. § 556: Sañjaya-
<div n="lb">yānap., V, {@23—28@}) had said, with {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} sanction,
<div n="lb">that {%Sañjaya%} should say to {%Duryodhana%} and {%Karṇa,%} threatening
<div n="lb">them with {%Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), that if the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
<div n="lb">desired war, then all the aims of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were accom-
<div n="lb">plished, as {%Duryodhana%} should lie down on the bare earth,
<div n="lb">deprived of life, etc. {%Arjuna (b)%} trusted himself and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%(c);%} he said that {%Duryodhana%} often thought of imprisoning
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} and sought to create a sudden disunion between
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna.%} “There are with us many aged
<div n="lb">{%brahmans,%} versed in various sciences…who are pro-
<div n="lb">phesying the great destruction of the {%Kurus%} and the {%Sṛñjayas,%}
<div n="lb">and the ultimate victory of the {%Pāṇḍavas…%} thy bow
<div n="lb">{%Gāṇḍīva%} yawns without being handled, etc.; on the top of
<div n="lb">my flagstaff are heard terrific voices (‘when shall thy car be
<div n="lb">yoked, O {%Kirīṭin?’%}); innumerable jackals howl at night,
<div n="lb">and {%Rākṣasas%} frequently alight from the sky…I will
<div n="lb">use the {%Sthūṇākarṇa, Pāśupata,%} and {%Brāhma%} weapons, and
<div n="lb">all those that {%Śakra%} gave me.” [This speech of Arjuna is
<div n="lb">not found in § 556: Sañjayayānap.] (V, {@48@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said
<div n="lb">to {%Duryodhana%} that {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa (Nara-Nārāyaṇau)%}
<div n="lb">{%(d)%} were {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa:%} it was with their aid that
<div n="lb">{%Śakra%} vanquished the {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas; Nara%} slew
<div n="lb">hundreds and thousands of {%Paulomas%} and {%Kālakañjas%} in
<div n="lb">battle; {%Arjuna,%} with an arrow, severed the head of the
<div n="lb">{%Asura Jambha%} while the latter was about to swallow him;
<div n="lb">he afflicted {%Hiraṇyapura%} on the other side of the ocean,
<div n="lb">having vanquished in battle 60,000 of {%Nivātakavacas;%} and
<div n="lb">in the same way also {%Nārāyaṇa%} has, in this world, destroyed
<div n="lb">numberless other {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas. Karṇa%} boasted that
<div n="lb">he would slay all the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in battle, but was rebuked by
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} saying that {%Karṇa%} had seen his own brother slain by
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} in the city of {%Virāṭa,%} and alluding to the contents of
<div n="lb">the Goharaṇa-, and the Ghoṣayātrāparvan. {%Droṇa%} also
<div n="lb">counselled peace, but got no answer from {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (V, {@49@}).
<div n="lb">At the request of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} related that the
[Page770-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Pañcālas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) looked up to {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} As he was
<div n="lb">questioned about {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and the {%Somakas,%} he first
<div n="lb">fell down in a swoon. Then, regarding {%Bhīmasena (e)%} he
<div n="lb">mentioned the lac-house, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); regarding {%Arjuna,%} the
<div n="lb">burning of the {%Khāṇḍava%} forest, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then {%Nakula (f)%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sahadeva (g); Śikhaṇḍin%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the five {%Kekaya%} princes,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@50@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was most afraid of {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">(who was taller than {%Arjuna%} by the span of the thumb),
<div n="lb">with his mace (full four cubits in length, with six sides),
<div n="lb">mentioning his killing {%Jarāsandha%} (V, {@51@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">was also afraid of {%Arjuna,%} who he feared would conquer
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} (being compassionate and heedless), and {%Droṇa%} (being
<div n="lb">aged and having affection for his pupil Arjuna); “thirty-
<div n="lb">three years have passed since the burning of the {%Khāṇḍava%}
<div n="lb">forest; we have never heard of his being defeated any-
<div n="lb">where” [but cf. the reading of B. {%trayastṛṃśat samāhūya,%} i.e.
<div n="lb">challenging the thirty-three gods] (V, {@52@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">was afraid of the allies of {%Yudhiṣṭhira:%} the {%Pāñcālas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kekayas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@53@}). {%Sañjaya%} rebuked {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} for
<div n="lb">his behaviour towards the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} “the {%Matsyas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">all decline to pay thee homage now” (V, {@54@}). {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">said, that when the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had been exiled, there came to
<div n="lb">them {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), all assembled in a place not far from
<div n="lb">{%Indraprastha,%} and suggested to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that he should
<div n="lb">take back the kingdom; “the people of the realm were all
<div n="lb">annoyed with us, and all our friends also were angry with
<div n="lb">us”; but {%Bhīṣma, Kṛpa,%} and {%Aśvatthāman%} had despised the
<div n="lb">foes (“inflamed with anger at the death of his father this
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} in days of old, had conquered all the kings of the
<div n="lb">earth, in a single chariot”). “Now the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are
<div n="lb">without allies; and all these kings can, for my sake, enter
<div n="lb">the fire or the sea…Having given up all hopes of a town,
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} craves only five villages…There is none on
<div n="lb">earth equal to me in an encounter with the mace. In battle,
<div n="lb">I am {%Saṅkarṣaṇa's%} equal; I will certainly slay {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), every one of these is singly capable of
<div n="lb">slaying the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}” He alluded to the superhuman
<div n="lb">circumstances concerning {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), to the resolution
<div n="lb">of the {%Saṃśaptakas%} to slay {%Arjuna%} or be slain by him; “our
<div n="lb">chief warriors are {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); they have seven
<div n="lb">{%akṣauhiṇīs,%} we have eleven; {%Bṛhaspati%} has said, that an
<div n="lb">army which is less by one-third ought to be encountered”
<div n="lb">(V, {@55@}). At the request of {%Duryodhana, Sañjaya%} described
<div n="lb">the chariots of {%Arjuna (h), Yudhiṣṭhira (i), Bhīmasena (j),%}
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva (k), Nakula (l);%} “and excellent steeds, presented
<div n="lb">by the celestials, carry the sons of {%Subhadrā%} and {%Draupadī%}”
<div n="lb">(V, {@56@}). At the request of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} mentioned
<div n="lb">the allies of the {%Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and who had been
<div n="lb">assigned to each of them as his share: {%Śikhaṇḍin & Bhīṣma;%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} & the {%Madra%} king; {%Bhīmasena & Duryodhana's%}
<div n="lb">sons and 100 brothers, the rulers of the east and the
<div n="lb">south; {%Arjuna & Karṇa, Jayadratha,%} etc.; the five {%Kekayas%}
<div n="lb">& the {%Kekayas, Mālavas, Śālvakas, Trigartau Saṃśaptakau;%}
<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu & Duryodhana's%} sons (?), {%Duḥśāsana's%} sons, king
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhadbala; Draupadeyāḥ + Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa;%}
<div n="lb">{%Cekitāna & Somadatta; Sātyaki & Kṛtavarman; Sahadeva%}
<div n="lb">{%& Śakuni; Nakula & Ulūka, Sārasvatāḥ.%} All the other
<div n="lb">kings had been distributed in their respective shares. Thus
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍava%} host had been distributed into divisions. {%Virāṭa%}
<div n="lb">with all his {%Matsya%} warriors would support {%Śikhaṇḍin.%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was exceedingly afraid of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} said that {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) were invincible.
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} maintained that {%Bhīṣma%} did not wish a battle.
[Page771-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} said that {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} was always urging the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} to fight, and professed that he would alone encounter
<div n="lb">all the assembled kings: {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and his words
<div n="lb">were approved by {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} had told
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} to say to the {%Kurus,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), that they ought not to
<div n="lb">suffer themselves to be slain by {%Arjuna,%} who was protected
<div n="lb">by the celestials; they should send a good man to {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} and entreat him to accept the kingdom. [This is not
<div n="lb">found in Sañjayayānap., § 556] (V, {@57@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} men-
<div n="lb">tioned that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} led the {%brahmacarya%} mode of life
<div n="lb">from his very youth, and saying that he himself, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) did
<div n="lb">not applaud war, he urged {%Duryodhana%} to desist from
<div n="lb">hostilities and give back to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} their kingdom,
<div n="lb">saying, that it was {%Karṇa, Duḥśāsana,%} and {%Śakuni%} who led
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} astray. {%Duryodhana%} answered that, without
<div n="lb">depending upon {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), he and {%Karṇa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana%} would perform, in honour of {%Yama,%} a sacrifice in
<div n="lb">battle and slay the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} he said that he would sacrifice
<div n="lb">his life rather than surrender to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} even that
<div n="lb">much of land which may be covered by the sharp point of a
<div n="lb">needle. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said that he abandoned {%Duryodhana%} for
<div n="lb">ever, and grieved for the kings who would be crushed by
<div n="lb">{%Yuyudhāna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@58@}). At the request of {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} related how he had entered the inner apart-
<div n="lb">ments (description) in order to inform {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa;%}
<div n="lb">he had seen two straight lines on {%Arjuna's%} foot-soles. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">had threatened the {%Kurus,%} mentioning that {%Kṛṣṇā%} had in-
<div n="lb">voked him with tears, and that D., As., men, Y., G., and N.
<div n="lb">were incapable of encountering {%Arjuna%} in battle, and alluding
<div n="lb">to his exploits in the city of {%Virāṭa%} (v. Goharaṇap.) (V, {@59@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} represented to {%Duryodhana%} that {%Agni%} would
<div n="lb">help {%Arjuna,%} remembering what was done to him at {%Khāṇḍava,%}
<div n="lb">that {%Dharma,%} etc., would help the {%Pāṇḍavas%} from parental
<div n="lb">affection, that {%Arjuna%} took up 500 arrows at a time, that
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) regarded him as invincible, and said he
<div n="lb">desired peace (V, {@60@}). {%Duryodhana,%} inflamed with wrath,
<div n="lb">said that according to {%Vyāsa, Nārada,%} and {%Paraśu-Rāma,%} the
<div n="lb">gods never engaged in work; if {%Agni, Vāyu, Dharma, Indra,%}
<div n="lb">or the {%Aśvins%} had ever engaged in work, the {%Pārthas%} could
<div n="lb">never have fallen into distress, and they and the {%Maruts%}
<div n="lb">would not venture to protect his foes; “charmed by me,
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} will be instantly extinguished…,my energy is
<div n="lb">greater than that of the gods;…it is I who set agoing
<div n="lb">all the affairs of both gods and {%Asuras%}…; neither D. nor
<div n="lb">G., nor As. nor Rā. are capable of saving him who has
<div n="lb">incurred my displeasure…; thou wilt hear of the defeat
<div n="lb">of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);…whatever knowledge of
<div n="lb">weapons there is in {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), exists in me as well”
<div n="lb">(V, {@61@}). {%Karṇa%} said to {%Duryodhana,%} mentioning the curse
<div n="lb">of {%Paraśu-Rāma,%} when he, by a lie, obtained the {%Brāhma%}
<div n="lb">weapon from him, that he would slay the {%Pāñcālas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} mentioned the {%Khāṇḍava%} forest, and said that the
<div n="lb">dart which {%Karṇa%} had got from {%Indra,%} would be reduced to
<div n="lb">ashes by {%Kṛṣṇa%} with his discus, and that his other shaft
<div n="lb">(having a head like a serpent), which he respectfully wor-
<div n="lb">shipped with flowery garlands, would be destroyed by {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">because he was protected by {%Kṛṣṇa. Karṇa%} made the
<div n="lb">pledge not to fight before {%Bhīṣma's%} fall, and went to his own
<div n="lb">abode. {%Bhīṣma%} ridiculed {%Karṇa's%} boasting before the kings
<div n="lb">of {%Avanti,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@62@}). {%Duryodhana%} boasted; {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">praised self-restraint (V, {@63@}). {%Vidura%} related that once two
<div n="lb">birds had flown away with the net in which they were
<div n="lb">caught, but were again caught when they began to quarrel.
[Page771-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">“So it is also with kinsmen. Once we, with some hunters and
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} conversant with magic and charms, repaired to the
<div n="lb">northern mountain {%Gandhamādana,%} with excellent medicinal
<div n="lb">herbs, and inhabited by Si. and G. There was, on a pre-
<div n="lb">cipice, some honey, {%Kubera's%} favourite drink, guarded by
<div n="lb">poisonous snakes; the {%brahmans%} said that a mortal drinking
<div n="lb">of it would win immortality, a sightless man obtain sight,
<div n="lb">and an old man would become a youth. The hunters desired
<div n="lb">to obtain it, and all perished. So it is with {%Duryodhana.%}
<div n="lb">In a single chariot {%Arjuna%} conquered the whole earth;
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa,%} etc. were routed by him at the city of
<div n="lb">{%Virāṭa.%} Remember also {%Drupada%} and the king of the
<div n="lb">{%Matsyas%}” (V, {@64@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} warned {%Duryodhana%} against
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and recommended him to follow
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) as his guides, mentioning the combat at
<div n="lb">the city of {%Virāṭa%} (V, {@65@}). At the request of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} related that {%Arjuna%} had said that {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">were all on the eve of death, if they did not give up to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} his own share of the kingdom (V, {@66@}). As
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} showed little regard for the words of {%Sañjaya,%}
<div n="lb">and the rest remained silent, the assembled kings rose and
<div n="lb">retired. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} who always followed the counsels of
<div n="lb">his son, began to inquire in secret of {%Sañjaya%} about the
<div n="lb">resolves of his own party and of the foes. {%Sañjaya%} caused
<div n="lb">him to let {%Vidura%} introduce {%Vyāsa%} and {%Gāndhārī%} (V, {@67@}).
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} extolled {%Kṛṣṇa (m),%} and mentioned some of those
<div n="lb">whom he had vanquished (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@68@}). Discourse between
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Sañjaya%} on the attributes of {%Kṛṣṇa.%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} told {%Duryodhana%} to seek refuge with {%Kṛṣṇa.%}
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} refused. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained of him to
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī. Gāndhārī%} threatened {%Duryodhana%} with {%Bhīmasena.%}
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} recommended to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to seek salvation through
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa.%} Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} explained the
<div n="lb">path of salvation through {%Kṛṣṇa%} (V, {@69@}). At the request
<div n="lb">of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} enumerated some names of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">(V, {@70@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained that he could not see
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} whom he extolled under several names (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@71@}).
