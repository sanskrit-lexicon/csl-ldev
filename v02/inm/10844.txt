[{@Tīrthayātrāparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">the pilgrimage to the tīrthas”, the 36th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of Mhbhr. Cf. Tīrthayātrā). § 356: {%Draupadī,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena, Nakula,%} and {%Sahadeva%} lamented {%Arjuna; Sahadeva%}
<div n="lb">suggested to move from the {%Kāmyaka%} wood (III, {@80@}). Then
<div n="lb">came the {%devarṣi Nārada%} who, at the request of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">told them what the {%brahmarṣi Pulastya%} had formerly said to
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} about the merits of circumambulating {%(pradakṣiṇāṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%yaḥ kurute)%} the earth for the purpose of visiting the {%tīrthas,%}
<div n="lb">when {%Bhīṣma%} was engaged in a {%pitrya vrata%} at {%Gaṅgādvāra%}
<div n="lb">(resorted to by {%devarṣis, Gandharvas,%} and gods) in the company
<div n="lb">of {%munis,%} and made oblations to the {%pitṛs,%} gods, and {%ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@81@}). At {%Bhīṣma's%} request {%Pulastya%} explained the
<div n="lb">qualities of a person who will acquire merit by visiting {%tīrthas;%}
<div n="lb">he said that the costly sacrifices, which only kings and very
<div n="lb">rich men are capable of affording, are not of greater merit
<div n="lb">than a sojourn in {%tīrthas,%} which even the poorest may accom-
<div n="lb">plish.—§ 357: Then he first described {%Puṣkara%} (q.v.).—
<div n="lb">§ 358: Then he enumerated a great many of tīrthas and the
<div n="lb">merit of visiting them.—§ 359: {%Vaḍavā%} (q.v.).—§ 360:
<div n="lb">{%Pulastya's%} enumeration of tīrthas continued (III, {@82@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 361: {%Kurukṣetra%} (q.v.).—§ 362: The enumeration con-
<div n="lb">tinued.—§ 363: {%Rāmahradāḥ%} (q.v.).—§ 364: The enumera-
<div n="lb">tion continued.—§ 365: {%Maṅkaṇaka%} (q.v.).—§ 366: The
<div n="lb">enumeration continued.—§ 367: {%Prthūdaka%} (q.v.).—§ 368:
<div n="lb">The enumeration continued.—§ 369: {%Kurukṣetra%} (q.v.).—
<div n="lb">§ 370: The enumeration continued (III, {@84@}).—§ 371:
<div n="lb">{%Tuṅgaka%} (q.v.).—§ 372: The enumeration continued.—
<div n="lb">§ 373: {%Prayāga%} (q.v.).—§ 374: The enumeration continued.
<div n="lb">—§ 375: {%Gaṅgā%} is equal to {%Kurukṣetra,%} wherever one may
<div n="lb">bathe in it, especially in {%Kanakhala%} and in {%Prayāga,%} which
<div n="lb">is the most excellent; a bath in the {%Gaṅgā%} in that place
<div n="lb">removes 100 sins. In the {%Kṛtayuga%} all the tīrthas were
<div n="lb">sacred, in the {%Tretāyuga Puṣkara%} alone, in the {%Dvāpara%}
<div n="lb">{%Kurukṣetra,%} in the {%Kaliyuga Gaṅgā.%} In {%Puṣkara%} one
<div n="lb">should practise austerities, in {%Mahālaya%} one should make
<div n="lb">gifts, on the {%Malaya%} one should ascend the funeral pyre, in
<div n="lb">{%Bhṛgutuṅga%} one should kill oneself by fasting; bathing in
<div n="lb">{%Puṣkara, Kurukṣetra,%} the {%Gaṅgā,%} and {%Magadha%} (PCR. seems
<div n="lb">to have had another reading) one purifies seven generations
[Page677-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">of one's race upwards and downwards, etc.; as long as one's
<div n="lb">bones lie in contact with the water of the {%Gaṅgā,%} so long
<div n="lb">does one live, honoured in heaven {%(Svargaloke). Pitāmaha%} has
<div n="lb">said that no {%tīrtha%} is equal to the {%Gaṅgā,%} no God to {%Keśava,%}
<div n="lb">and none is superior to brahmans. This truthful description
<div n="lb">one should recite only to the twice-born, etc. (*). In these
<div n="lb">{%tīrthas%} have bathed the {%Vasus,%} the {%Sādhyas%} (so B.), the
<div n="lb">{%Ādityas,%} the {%Maruts,%} the {%Aśvins,%} and the {%Ṛṣis,%} who are
<div n="lb">equal to the gods. Only men of piety and learning are able
<div n="lb">to visit these {%tīrthas%} on account of their purified senses, their
<div n="lb">belief in god {%(āstikyāt),%} and their acquaintance with the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas%} (end of {%Pulastya's%} discourse, in which Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">sometimes is addressed instead of Bhīṣma).—§ 376: {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">continued: Then {%Pulastya%} disappeared, and {%Bhīṣma%} (who
<div n="lb">understood the {%śāstras%}), at the command of {%Pulastya,%} wandered
<div n="lb">over the earth and ended his {%tīrthayātrā%} at {%Prayāga.%} The
<div n="lb">man that so walks about the earth is rewarded after death as
<div n="lb">much as for 100 horse sacrifices. “So wilt thou {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">obtain the eight-fold {%(aṣṭaguṇaṃ) dharma,%} as {%Bhīṣma%} did
<div n="lb">before, and because thou wilt lead the ṛṣis, thy merit will
<div n="lb">be eight-fold; those {%tīrthas%} are infested by {%Rākṣasas,%} and
<div n="lb">no king, save thyself, has gone there (*). The foremost of
<div n="lb">ṛṣis are always there and expect thee: {%Vālmīki, Kaśyapa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Ātreya, Kuṇḍajaṭhara, Viśvāmitra, Gautama, Asita Devala,%}
<div n="lb">{%Mārkaṇḍeya, Gālava, Bharadvāja, Vasiṣṭha, Uddālaka,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śaunaka%} with his son, {%Vyāsa, Durvāsas,%} and {%Jābāli.%} With
<div n="lb">them do thou visit these {%tīrthas.%} The great {%ṛṣi Lomaśa%} will
<div n="lb">come to thee, do thou follow him and me to these {%tīrthas.%}”
<div n="lb">Then {%Nārada%} disappeared and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} spoke to the
<div n="lb">ascetics of the {%tīrthas%} (III, {@85@}).—§ 377: {%Dhaumya-tīrthaka-%}
<div n="lb">{%thana%} (q.v.).—§ 378: While {%Dhaumya%} was speaking thus,
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa%} arrived and told that {%Arjuna%} had obtained {%Brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%śiras-(b),%} learnt the {%Gāndharva Veda,%} etc. (III, {@91@}). {%Lomaśa%}
<div n="lb">said that {%Arjuna%} had asked him to cause {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
<div n="lb">visit all {%tīrthas,%} like {%Manu%} and other {%rājarṣis,%} and protect
<div n="lb">him from the {%Rākṣasas%} as {%Dadhīca%} had protected {%Indra%} and
<div n="lb">{%Aṅgiras%} had protected the {%Sun. Lomaśa%} had twice before
<div n="lb">visited the {%tīrthas.%} At the command of {%Lomaśa, Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">caused the citizens, brahmans, and {%Yatis,%} who were not able
<div n="lb">to endure the privations of the journey, to return to {%Hāsti-%}
<div n="lb">{%napura,%} where {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} gave them their proper allow-
<div n="lb">ances from affection for {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} with
<div n="lb">only a small number of brahmans abode for three nights at
<div n="lb">{%Kāmyaka%} cheered by {%Lomaśa%} (III, {@92@}). The brahmans,
<div n="lb">who dwelt in the wood, prevailed upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that he
<div n="lb">allowed them to partake of the {%tīrthayātrā.%} Just when they
<div n="lb">were about to start, {%Vyāsa, Parvata,%} and {%Nārada%} came to
<div n="lb">{%Kāmyaka,%} and caused them not only to fulfil human vows by
<div n="lb">purifying the body, but even divine vows by purifying the
<div n="lb">heart, that it might be free from evil thoughts and harbour
<div n="lb">only friendly feelings towards everybody. When those
<div n="lb">celestial and human ṛṣis had performed the usual propitiatory
<div n="lb">ceremonies, and when they had worshipped the feet of {%Lomaśa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Dvaipāyana, Nārada,%} and the {%devarṣi Parvata,%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kṛṣṇā%} started towards the east with {%Dhaumya%} and the
<div n="lb">ascetics on the day following Mārgaśīrṣī, when {%Puṣya%} was
<div n="lb">in ascendance, dressed in bark and hides, with matted locks,
<div n="lb">cased in mail, and armed with swords, etc., with {%Indrasena%}
<div n="lb">and other attendants with some fourteen {%(paricaturdaśaiḥ)%}
<div n="lb">chariots and a number of cooks (III, {@93@}). As {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} asked why he who is virtuous is unhappy, and his
<div n="lb">enemies who are sinful, happy, {%Lomaśa%} said that sinful men
<div n="lb">often prosper in consequence of their sins, but at last they
[Page677-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">are overtaken by destruction, even as in the {%devayuga%} the
<div n="lb">{%Daiteyas%} and {%Dānavas (Asuras),%} who practised vice {%(adharma)%}
<div n="lb">and did not visit the {%tīrthas,%} for a time prospered by their
<div n="lb">sin and vanquished the gods, who practised virtue and visited
<div n="lb">the {%tīrthas;%} at last, when the good qualities, prosperity, etc.,
<div n="lb">left the Asuras and went to the gods, while bad qualities,
<div n="lb">adversity, etc., came to the {%Asuras,%} and {%Kali%} possessed them,
<div n="lb">they were overtaken by destruction. {%Nṛga, Śibi Auśīnara,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhagīratha, Vasumanas, Gaya, Pūru,%} and {%Purūravas%} had by
<div n="lb">practising ascetic penances and visiting {%tīrthas,%} etc., obtained
<div n="lb">fame and wealth, etc., and so would {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and as
<div n="lb">{%Ikṣvāku%} with his sons, etc., and {%Mucukunda, Māndhātṛ,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Marutta,%} and the gods and {%devarṣis%} obtained fame by the
<div n="lb">power of asceticism, so would {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} while the
<div n="lb">{%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} enslaved by sinfulness and ignorance, soon
<div n="lb">would be exterminated (III, {@94@}).—§ 379: The {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">with their followers, proceeding from place to place, at last
<div n="lb">arrived at {%Naimiṣa,%} and thence to the {%Gomatī,%} etc. (enumera-
<div n="lb">tion of {%tīrthas%} visited).—§ 380: {%Brahmasaras%} (q.v.).—
<div n="lb">§ 381: {%Gaya%} (q.v.).—§ 382: Thence they came to the
<div n="lb">hermitage of {%Agastya,%} and dwelt in {%Durjayā%} (i.e. {%Maṇimatī,%}
<div n="lb">the city of {%Vātāpi,%} Nīl.); there asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa%} told: {%Agastyopākhyāna%} (q.v.).—§ 383: Descrip-
<div n="lb">tion of the {%Gaṅgā (b).%} Then, having at the suggestion of
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa,%} with his brothers and {%Kṛṣṇā,%} bathed in {%Bhṛgos%}
<div n="lb">{%tīrthaṃ (c)%} and gratified the gods and {%Pitṛs, Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">blazed forth in brighter effulgence and became invincible.
<div n="lb">At his request {%Lomaśa%} told {%Jāmadagnyatejohānikathana (b)%}
<div n="lb">(v. {%Rāma<sup>1</sup>%}).—§ 384: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to hear the details
<div n="lb">of {%Agastya. Lomaśa%} related: {%Agastyopākhyāna%} (q.v.).—
<div n="lb">§ 385: At the request of {%Yudhiṣṭhira Lomaśa%} related how
<div n="lb">{%Agastya%} had caused {%Vindhya%} (q.v.) to cease to increase
<div n="lb">(§ 385), how {%Agastya%} drank up the Ocean (§ 386, cf.
<div n="lb">Agastyopākhyāna), {%Sagara%} (§ 387), {%Asamañjas%} (§ 388),
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgāvataraṇa%} (§ 389).—§ 390: Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} pro-
<div n="lb">ceeded to the rivers {%Nandā%} and {%Aparanandā%} and the {%Hemakūṭa%}
<div n="lb">({%b,%} cf. {%Ṛṣabhakūṭa%}) mountain. Having, at the command of
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa,%} bathed in {%Nandā,%} they proceeded to the river {%Kauśikī%}
<div n="lb">{%(c)%} with the hermitages of {%Viśvāmitra%} and of {%Kāśyapa,%} the
<div n="lb">father of {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga (d).%}—§ 391: At the request of {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira Lomaśa%} told the history of {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga%} (q.v.)—§ 392:
<div n="lb">Starting from {%Kauśikī, Yudhiṣṭhira%} in succession repaired to
<div n="lb">all the sacred shrines {%(āyatanāni)%} and came to the sea where
<div n="lb">the {%Gaṅgā%} falls into it, and bathed in the centre of 500 rivers.
<div n="lb">Then they proceeded by the shore of the sea towards the
<div n="lb">{%Kaliṅga%} country. {%Lomaśa%} said: “Here is the river
<div n="lb">{%Vaitaraṇī (b).%}” When they had all bathed in the {%Vaitaraṇī,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} felt as if he were carried off from the region
<div n="lb">of men, and beheld all worlds, and heard the reciting of
<div n="lb">{%Vaikhānasas,%} whom {%Lomaśa%} declared to be at the distance of
<div n="lb">300,000 {%yojanas. Lomaśa%} ordered him to be silent, as this
<div n="lb">was the divine forest of {%Svayambhū (Svayambhuvo vanaṃ) (c);%}
<div n="lb">taught by {%Lomaśa%} the words to be recited ({%Oṃ namo viśva-%}
<div n="lb">{%guptāya,%} etc. [<lang n="greek"></lang>]) {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} mounted the altar of
<div n="lb">{%Kaśyapa%} and bathed in the sea; then he went to the {%Mahendra%}
<div n="lb">mountain and spent the night there (III, {@114@}).—§ 393:
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa%} told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the names of the ascetics {%(Bhṛgus,%}
<div n="lb">{%Aṅgirases, Vāsiṣṭhas, Kāśyapas),%} and he, with his brothers,
<div n="lb">paid a visit to them. {%Akṛtavraṇa,%} a follower of {%Rāma%}
<div n="lb">{%Jāmadagnya,%} told him when {%Paraśu-Rāma%} (q.v.) appeared,
<div n="lb">and that the following day was the 14th.—§ 394: At the
<div n="lb">request of {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Akṛtavraṇa (b)%} related the story
<div n="lb">of {%Arjuna Kārtavīrya%} (q.v.), and {%Jamadagni%} (q.v.), and
[Page678-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Paraśurāma%} (q.v.) (§§ 394—8)—§ 399: {%Mahendrācala-gamana%}
<div n="lb">(q.v.).—§ 400: On their journey to the {%tīrthas%} they bathed in
<div n="lb">a holy stream, and thence reached to {%Godāvarī%} and to the sea
<div n="lb">(in the {%Draviḍa%} country); then to {%Agastyatīrtha%} and the {%Nārī-%}
<div n="lb">{%tīrthas,%} where they heard of and praised the deed of {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">and gave away thousands of cows, and by and by they
<div n="lb">reached {%Śūrpāraka%} (C. {%Sūrp°%}), where they saw the altar of
<div n="lb">{%Ṛcīka's%} son surrounded by crowds of ascetics, and the shrines
<div n="lb">of the {%Vasus,%} of the hosts of the {%Maruts,%} of the {%Aśvins,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vaivasvata, Āditya, Dhaneśvara, Indra, Viṣṇu, Savitṛ, Bhava,%}
<div n="lb">{%Candra, Divākara,%} and of the lord of waters, and of the host
<div n="lb">of {%Sādhyas,%} of {%Dhātṛ,%} of the {%Pitṛs,%} of {%Rudra%} with his host,
<div n="lb">of {%Sarasvatī,%} of the host of {%Siddhas,%} etc., and then returned
<div n="lb">to {%Śūrpāraka,%} and from this {%tīrtha%} at the sea they came to
<div n="lb">{%Prabhāsa,%} where they offered libations to the {%Pitṛs%} and gods,
<div n="lb">and where {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} practised austerities for twelve days,
<div n="lb">subsisting upon air and water, and performing ablutions day
<div n="lb">and night, surrounded by fires kindled on all sides. There
<div n="lb">came to them {%Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa, Śāmba,%} etc., {%Kārṣṇi,%} the
<div n="lb">grandson of {%Śini,%} and other {%Vṛṣṇis,%} and heard what had
<div n="lb">happened to them, and wept when they saw the {%Pāṇḍavas%} so
<div n="lb">exceedingly lean (III, {@118@}).—§ 401: {%Bala-Rāma%} (q.v.).—
<div n="lb">§ 402: {%Sātyaki,%} citing {%Śaibya,%} etc., who did the work for
<div n="lb">{%Yayāti,%} recommended that {%Rāma, Kṛṣṇa, Pradyumna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śāmba (b),%} himself, {%Aniruddha, Gada, Ulmuka, Bāhuka, Bhānu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Nītha,%} the young hero {%Niśatha, Sāraṇa,%} and {%Cārudeṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">should lead the united army of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Andhakas, Sāttvatas,%} and {%Śūras%} (C. {%Sū°%}) against the {%Dhārta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭras%} and kill them in battle, and that {%Abhimanyu%} should
<div n="lb">rule the earth until {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had fulfilled his vow.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would never accept the
<div n="lb">sovereignty unless it were won by their own prowess, and
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} assented to the words of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} saying, that as
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} alone knew him, so he alone knew {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who
<div n="lb">would perceive when the time had come for bravery, and he
<div n="lb">and {%Sātyaki%} would then defeat {%Suyodhana.%} Then the {%Yadus%}
<div n="lb">returned home, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} continued their journey
<div n="lb">accompanied by {%Lomaśa,%} and came to the river {%Payoṣṇī (c).%}—
<div n="lb">§ 403: {%Lomaśa%} spoke of sacrifices that had formerly been
<div n="lb">performed at the {%Payoṣṇī (b);%} he who bathed in the {%Payoṣṇī%}
<div n="lb">would obtain the same {%lokas%} as {%Gaya.%}—§ 404: Having
<div n="lb">bathed in the {%Payoṣṇī%} they went to {%Vaidūryaparvata%} and
<div n="lb">{%Narmadā,%} where they, according to the exposition of {%Lomaśa,%}
<div n="lb">visited all the {%tīrthas%} and shrines, giving gifts to the brahmans
<div n="lb">by thousands. {%Lomaśa%} said that this was the junction
<div n="lb">between the {%Tretā%} and {%Dvāpara%} age, where a person is freed
<div n="lb">of all his sins, and that here was performed the sacrifice of
<div n="lb">{%Śaryāti (b), Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to hear more about it
<div n="lb">(III, {@121@}).—§ 405: {%Sukanyopākhyāna%} (q.v.).—§ 406:
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa%} recommended to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to visit the above-
<div n="lb">named lake, and {%Sikatākṣa,%} and the {%Saindhava%} wood, and
<div n="lb">{%Puṣkara%} (reciting the hymns of {%Sthāṇu,%} this being the
<div n="lb">junction of the {%Dvāpara%} and {%Tretā,%} etc.), and {%Ārcīkaparvata (b).%}
<div n="lb">Here the ṛṣis eat rice boiled in milk. Here(?) is the
<div n="lb">{%Yamunā,%} where Kṛṣṇa performed austerities; there is the
<div n="lb">holy spring of Indra, where {%Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ,%} and {%Varuṇa%}
<div n="lb">rose upwards. In the {%Yamunā Māndhātṛ%} and {%Somaka Sāhadevi%}

<div n="lb">(who, with his sister's son {%Aṣṭāvakra,%} was the best in that
