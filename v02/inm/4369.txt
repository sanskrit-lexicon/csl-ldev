{@Hanūmatpratyāgamana@}¦ (“the returning of Hanūmat”).
§ 534: Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were dwelling on the mountain
Mālyavat. Rāma sent Lakṣmaṇa to Kiṣkindhyā to threaten
Sugrīva. Sugrīva, however, said that he had despatched
monkeys in all directions to find out Sītā. After a month
those who had been sent to the north, the east, and the west
returned. After two months Hanūmat, Aṅgada, etc.,
returned from the south, after having pillaged Madhuvaṇa
({%b%}). Hanūmat told that in a cavern of the palace of Maya
the ascetic Prabhāvatī had shown them the way; on the shore
they had seen the mountains Sahya, Malaya, and Dardura,
then they had met Sampāti, the brother of Jaṭāyu(s) ({%c%}),
and had informed him of everything; Sampāti then had
directed them to Laṅkā ({%d%}), whereafter Hanūmat had crossed
the ocean and slain the Rākṣasī of the water, and had been
[Page318-b+ 63]
recognized by Sītā from the words of Avindhya; Sītā had
given him a jewel as a credential and told him, as a token,
that Rāma on the mountain Citrakūṭa had shot a blade of
grass at a crow; Hanūmat then had caused himself to be
seized by the soldiers of Rāvaṇa, and set fire to Laṅkā.
