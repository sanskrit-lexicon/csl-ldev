<div n="lb">§ 534: Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were dwelling on the mountain
<div n="lb">Mālyavat. Rāma sent Lakṣmaṇa to Kiṣkindhyā to threaten
<div n="lb">Sugrīva. Sugrīva, however, said that he had despatched
<div n="lb">monkeys in all directions to find out Sītā. After a month
<div n="lb">those who had been sent to the north, the east, and the west
<div n="lb">returned. After two months Hanūmat, Aṅgada, etc.,
<div n="lb">returned from the south, after having pillaged Madhuvaṇa
<div n="lb">{%(b).%} Hanūmat told that in a cavern of the palace of Maya
<div n="lb">the ascetic Prabhāvatī had shown them the way; on the shore
<div n="lb">they had seen the mountains Sahya, Malaya, and Dardura,
<div n="lb">then they had met Sampāti, the brother of Jaṭāyu(s) (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">and had informed him of everything; Sampāti then had
<div n="lb">directed them to Laṅkā {%(d),%} whereafter Hanūmat had crossed
<div n="lb">the ocean and slain the Rākṣasī of the water, and had been

<div n="lb">recognized by Sītā from the words of Avindhya; Sītā had
<div n="lb">given him a jewel as a credential and told him, as a token,
<div n="lb">that Rāma on the mountain Citrakūṭa had shot a blade of
<div n="lb">grass at a crow; Hanūmat then had caused himself to be
<div n="lb">seized by the soldiers of Rāvaṇa, and set fire to Laṅkā.
