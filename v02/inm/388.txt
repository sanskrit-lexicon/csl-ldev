860, (862), 863, 865, 866. The Pitṛs (of Paraśu-Rāma) said:
R.-ṛ. Alarka, having with his bow conquered the whole earth,
set his mind on what is subtle; he said: “My mind has
become strong; having conquered the mind, one's conquest
becomes permanent; I shall shoot sharp-pointed arrows at
the mind.” The mind said: “These arrows will never pierce
me, but only slay thyself; do thou look out for other arrows
with which to destroy me”; and so also with the nose, the
tongue, etc. Then he set himself to penances, but failed to
obtain fit arrows. He engaged in {%yoga%}, and now slew all the
senses with one arrow. He complained that he [had lost
his time] in courting sovereignty till now; “there is no
happiness higher than {%yoga%}.”
