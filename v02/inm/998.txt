{@Aurvopākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating to Aurva”).
<div n="lb">§ 227 (Parāśara): King Kṛtavīrya, the {%yājya%} of the {%Bhṛgus,%}
<div n="lb">at the end of the {%Soma%} sacrifice gratified the {%brahmans%}
<div n="lb">with large offerings. After he had ascended to heaven, it
<div n="lb">came to happen that his descendants were in want of wealth.
<div n="lb">Knowing that the {%Bhṛgus%} were rich, they went to them and
<div n="lb">begged. Some amongst the {%Bhṛgus%} buried their wealth
<div n="lb">under the earth, some gave it away to {%brahmans,%} and some
<div n="lb">duly gave it to the {%kṣattriyas.%} Some {%kṣattriyas,%} while
<div n="lb">digging at the house of a {%Bhārgava,%} came upon a large
<div n="lb">treasure. The {%kṣattriyas%} then began to kill the {%Bhṛgus%}
<div n="lb">with their arrows all over the earth, even the embryos.
<div n="lb">A {%Bhṛgu%} woman fled to {%Himavat,%} holding an embryo in
<div n="lb">one of her thighs (“for 100 years,” v. 6822). From fear
<div n="lb">a {%brahman%} woman reported this to the {%kṣattriyas.%} The
<div n="lb">{%kṣattriyas%} then went to destroy that embryo, which, how-
<div n="lb">ever, came out, tearing open the thigh and dazzling the eyes
<div n="lb">of the {%kṣattriyas%} so that they lost their sight. They asked
<div n="lb">the woman that they might be restored to sight, promising to
<div n="lb">abstain from their sinful practice (I, {@178@}). She told them
<div n="lb">to ask the child, which they did, and regaining their eye-
<div n="lb">sights they went away. The child {%(viprarṣi)%} was named
<div n="lb">{%Aurva,%} because he had been born after tearing open his
<div n="lb">mother's thigh {%(ūru). Aurva%} devoted himself to the austerest
<div n="lb">of penances with the object of destroying the whole world to
<div n="lb">gratify his ancestors. The {%Pitṛs%} then all came from {%Pitṛloka,%}
<div n="lb">and said: “Be propitious towards the three worlds. Having
<div n="lb">grown weary with the long periods of life allotted to us, we
<div n="lb">desired our own destruction through the {%kṣattriyas.%} Such
<div n="lb">as commit suicide never attain to regions that are blessed,
<div n="lb">therefore we abstained from self-destruction” (I, {@179@}).
<div n="lb">When {%Aurva%} replied that his vow must not be in vain, the
<div n="lb">{%Pitṛs%} prevailed upon him to throw his wrath into the waters
<div n="lb">of the ocean, the whole universe being made of water. It
<div n="lb">became a large horse-head, which, emitting fire from its
<div n="lb">mouth, consumes the waters of the ocean (I, {@180@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 228: Hearing this the {%viprarṣi%} Parāśara controlled his
<div n="lb">wrath from destroying the worlds. But he performed
<div n="lb">a great {%rākṣasa%} sacrifice and began to burn the {%rākṣasas%}
<div n="lb">in it, and {%Vasiṣṭha%} did not restrain him. Desirous of
<div n="lb">ending that sacrifice the {%ṛṣi Atri%} came to that place, and
<div n="lb">also {%Pulastya%} and {%Pulaha%} and {%Kratu,%} desiring to save the
<div n="lb">{%rākṣasas.%} Seeing that many {%rākṣasas%} had already been
<div n="lb">slain, {%Pulastya%} said: “That which befell thy father was
<div n="lb">brought about by his own curse! No {%rākṣasa%} was capable
<div n="lb">of devouring {%Śakti;%} he himself provided for his own death!
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra%} was only a blind instrument in that matter.
<div n="lb">Both {%Śakti%} and {%Kalmāṣapāda%} have ascended to heaven,
<div n="lb">and are enjoying great happiness, as also the other sons of
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha.%} Abandon this sacrifice of thine.” {%Parāśara%} then
<div n="lb">brought his sacrifice to an end, and threw the fire into the
<div n="lb">woods on the north of the {%Himavat,%} where it may be seen to
<div n="lb">this day consuming {%rākṣasas%} and trees and stones in all
<div n="lb">seasons {%(parvaṇi parvaṇi)%} (I, {@181@}).
