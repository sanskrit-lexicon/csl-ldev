3440, 3441, 3447: The hunter {%Balāka%} used to slay animals

devoted to the duties of his own order. One day, having
found no other animal, he slew a blind ({%ghrāṇacakṣuṣaṃ%})
beast of prey while it was drinking water. A shower of
flowers fell from the skies; a celestial chariot took him to
heaven, while Aps., etc., were singing. That beast of prey
had by austerities obtained a boon, and had become the cause
of the destruction of all creatures. For this reason he was
made blind by {%Brahman%}.
