{@44@}, 2452.—§ 615{%u%} (do.): In days of yore the seed of
{%Maheśvara%} dropped and fell into a blazing fire; {%Agni%} could
not burn it, and at the command of Brahmán threw it into
the {%Gaṅgā%}, who, unable to bear it, washed it away on Mount
{%Himavat%}, where it, on a clump of reeds, developed into {%S%}.
(Kārttikeya, Gāṅgeya), who was seen by the {%Kṛttikāḥ%}, and
having assumed six mouths, sucked them all. {%Himavat%} was
transformed into gold, and from this reason mountains became
producers of gold. Lying on that golden clump of reeds he
was praised by {%G.%}, etc. {%Gaṅgā%} waited upon him, and Earth
held him; the celestial priest {%Bṛhaspati%} performed the usual
rites ({%jātakarmādikāḥ kriyāḥ%}); the {%Veda%} in a fourfold form
({%caturmūrtiḥ%}) and the fourfold ({%catuṣpādaḥ) Dhanurveda%} and
all weapons ({%śastragrāmaḥ sasaṅgrahaḥ%}) approached him. One
day he saw {%Śiva%} and {%Umā%} amid a swarm of ghastly creatures
(description). Also the seven {%Mātṛs%} were present there, and
S., V.-D., M., V., P., R., Ā., Si., Serpents, Dā., the birds,
{%Brahmán%} with his two sons, and {%Viṣṇu%} and {%Indra%}, and
D.-G. headed by {%Nārada%} and D.-ṛ., and Si. headed by
{%Bṛhaspati%}, and the fathers of the universe who are the gods
of even the gods, and the {%Yāmas%} and {%Dhāmas. Śiva, Umā%},
{%Gaṅgā%}, and {%Agni%} each thought: “he will come to me,”
therefore he by his yoga power assumed four forms; {%Skanda%}
went to {%Rudra, Viśākḥa%} to {%Umā, Śākha%} (which is his {%Vāyu%}-
form) to {%Agni, Naigameya%} to {%Gaṅgā%}. D., Dā., and Rā.
made a loud noise. {%Rudra, Umā, Agni%}, and {%Gaṅgā%} prevailed
upon {%Brahmán%}, who had formerly given away the sovereignties
of D., G., Rā., Bh., Y., birds, and Pn., that he gave him the
state of a generalissimo ({%saināpatya%}) among all creatures;
and {%Brahmán%} ordered the kings of the hosts of the gods to
wait upon him. Then the gods headed by {%Brahmán%}, taking
{%Skanda%} with them, came together to {%Himavat%} for his instal-
ment on the bank of the {%Sarasvatī (puṇyāṃ Haimavatīṃ%}
{%devīṃ%}), which at {%Samantapañcaka%} is celebrated over the three
worlds; there D. and G. cheerfully took their seats (IX,
{@44@}). Collecting all articles for the investiture according to
the scriptures, {%Bṛhaspati%} duly poured libations into the fire;
{%Himavat%} gave a seat adorned with gems, on which {%Kārttikeya%}
[Page641-a+ 63]
was seated; {%Indra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>) there came together; {%Brahmán%},
{%Kāśyapa%}, etc., poured water from the {%Sarasvatī%} upon {%Skanda%},
even as the gods had poured water on the head of {%Varuṇa%},
the lord of the waters, in order to invest him with sovereignty:
{%Brahmán%} gave to {%Skanda%} four mighty companions ({%mahāpā-%}
{%riṣadān%}) with speed like the wind, and crowned with ascetic
success ({%siddhān): Nandisena, Lohitākṣa, Ghaṇṭākarṇa%}, and
{%Kumudamālin. Sthāṇu%} gave to {%Skanda%} a mighty companion
({%pāriṣadaṃ%}) capable of producing 100 illusions, and who, in
the great battle between the gods and the Asuras, slew with
his hands alone 14 millions ({%prayutāni caturdaśa%}). Then the
gods made over to {%Skanda%} an army consisting of {%Nairṛtas%} of
a form like that of {%Viṣṇu%}. Then D. with I., G., Y., Rā., Mu.
and P. shouted “victory” ({%jayaśabdaṃ%}). Then {%Yama%} gave
him two companions ({%anucarau%}), both of whom resembled
Death (read {%Yamaḥ Kālopamau%} with C., B. has {%Yama-%}
{%Kālopamau%}): {%Unmātha%} and {%Pramātha. Sūrya%} gave him two
of his followers, {%Subhrāja%} and {%Bhāsvara; Soma%} gave him two
companions ({%anucarau): Maṇi%} and {%Sumaṇi%}, both like summits
of {%Kailāsa%}, with white garlands and white unguents. {%Agni%}
gave to his son (i.e. Skanda) the heroic {%Jvālājihva%} and {%Jyotis%}.
{%Aṃśa%} gave him five companions: {%Parigha%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>). {%Indra%}
gave him two companions: {%Utkrośa%} and {%Pañcaka%}, armed
with thunderbolt and club respectively, and who had in
battle slain innumerable enemies of {%Indra. Viṣṇu%} gave him
three companions: {%Cakra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>). The {%Aśvins%} gave him
{%Vardhana%} and {%Nandana%}, who had mastered all the sciences.
{%Dhāṭr%} gave him five companions: {%Kunda%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>). {%Tvaṣṭr%}
gave him {%Cakra%} and {%Anucakra%}, both capable of producing
illusions ({%mahāmāyau%}), etc. {%Mitra%} gave him {%Suvrata%} and
{%Satyasandha%} of great learning and ascetic merits ({%tapovidyā-%}
{%dharau%}), and capable of granting boons. {%Vidhātṛ%} gave him
{%Suprabha%} and {%Śubhakarman. Pūṣan%} gave him two com-
panions ({%pārṣadau): Pāṇītaka%} and {%Kālika%}, with great powers
of illusion ({%mahāmāyāvinau). Vāyu%} gave him {%Bala%} and
{%Atibala%}, with great mouths. {%Varuṇa%} gave him {%Yama%} and
{%Atiyama%} (PCR.: {%Ghasa%} and {%Atighasa%}), with mouths like that
of the {%timi. Himavat%} gave him {%Suvarcas%} and {%Ativarcas%}.
{%Meru%} gave him {%Kāñcana%} and {%Meghamālin. Manu%} gave him
{%Sthira%} and {%Atisthira. Vindhya%} gave him {%Ucchṛṅga%} and
{%Atiśṛṅga%} (PCR.: {%Ucchrita%} and {%Agniśṛṅga%}) who fought with
large stones. {%Samudra%} (the ocean) gave him {%Saṅgraha%} and
{%Vigraha%}, armed with maces. {%Pārvatī%} gave him {%Unmāda%},
{%Śaṅkukaraṇa%}, and {%Puṣpadanta. Vāsuki%} gave him the snakes
{%Jaya%} and {%Mahājaya%}. Similarly S., R., V., P., etc. gave
commanders of forces armed with lances, etc. Moreover,
there were several other combatants: {%Śaṅkukarṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>).
Besides, {%Brahmán%} gave him thousands upon thousands of
mighty companions, devoted to ascetic austerities and
regardful of brahmans, of different ages and with different
kinds of faces ({%extremely fanciful description%}; the faces of
some resembled that of {%Garuḍa%}, etc.), they spoke various
kinds of languages ({%nānābhāṣāḥ; kuśalā deśabhāṣāsu%}) (IX,
{@45@}). Also the large bands of the Mothers ({%Mātṛgaṇān%}),
those slayers of foes, by whom the universe is pervaded,
became the companions of {%Kumāra%}; the names of the {%Mātṛs%}
are: {%Prabhāvatī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>) (description), some of them partook
of the nature of {%Yama%}, some of that of {%Rudra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>);
they were beautiful like Aps., in voice they resembled the
{%kokila%}, in prosperity {%Kubera%}, in battle their energy resembled
that of {%Indra%}, etc., they have their abodes on trees and open
spots and crossings of four roads, also in caves, crematoriums,
mountains, and springs; they speak different languages.
[Page641-b+ 63]
{%Indra%} gave to {%Guha%} (i.e. Skanda) a dart for the destruction
of the enemies of the gods (description), and a banner.
{%Śiva%} gave him a large army named {%Dhanañjayā%}, protected
by 30,000 warriors equal to Rudra himself. {%Viṣṇu%} gave
him a triumphal garland that enhanced the power of the
wearer. {%Umā%} gave him two pieces of cloth, of effulgence
like that of the sun. {%Gaṅgā%} a celestial waterpot produced
from amṛta. {%Garuḍa%} gave him his favourite son {%Citrabarhin%},
a peacock. {%Aruṇa%} gave a cock of sharp talons. {%Varuṇa%}
gave a snake of great energy. {%Brahmán%} gave him, as
devoted to the {%Bráhman (brahmaṇyāya%}), a black deerskin
and ({%Lokabhāvanaḥ%}, presumably = Brahmán) victory in all
battles. (Description of Skanda's army.) The gods with
{%Indra%} praised {%Kumāra%}. The D-G. sung, and Aps. danced.
{%Skanda%} granted a boon to all the gods, saying: “I shall
slay all your foes.” He then, with that vast host, set out
for the destruction of the {%Daityas%}, having Exertion ({%Vyava-%}
{%sāya%}), etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>) in the van. All Dai., Rā., and Dā. fled,
pursued by the gods. Millions of darts issued from {%Skanda's%}
dart. He at last slew {%Tāraka%} (the chief of the {%Daityas%}),
etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>); the foes were consumed with flames, produced by
{%Skanda%}; many were killed by his roars alone, etc. (description).
{%Bali's%} son, the {%Daiteya Bāṇa%}, took shelter within the {%Krauñca%}
mountain (named after its sound, resembling the cry of a
{%krauñca%} bird) which {%Kārttikeya%} (i.e. {%Skanda%}) pierced with
that dart given to him by Agni (! v. the note of PCR.,
page 186) (description); Vd. soared into the air; K. became
very anxious; Dai. came out and were slain together with
that son of the {%Daitya%} chief and his younger brother.
Repeatedly hurled from {%Skanda's%} hand, the dart repeatedly
came back to him. The gods, G. and M-ṛ ({%yajvānaḥ%})
honoured {%Skanda (yoginām īśvaram%}), the celestial ladies
showered plenty of flowers upon him. Some speak of him as
{%Sanatkumāra%} (the eldest son of {%Brahmán%}), some as the son
of {%Maheśvara%}, and some as that of {%Agni%}, or of {%Umā%}, or of
the {%Kṛttikās%}, or of {%Gaṅgā%}. That tīrtha on the {%Sarasvatī%}
then became a second heaven; staying there {%Skanda%} gave to
everybody various kinds of dominion and bestowed the three
worlds on the foremost of the {%Nairṛtas%} ({%Nairṛtamukhyebhyaḥ%},
so both B. and C.; “the foremost ones of the celestials,”
