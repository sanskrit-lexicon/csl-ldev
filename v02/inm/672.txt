[{@Ānuśāsanikaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to in-
<div n="lb">struction,” the 91st of the minor parvans of Mahābhārata;
<div n="lb">cf. Anuśāsanika). § 719: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} despondency at the
<div n="lb">slaughter of his kinsmen on the field of {%Kurukṣetra;%} he
<div n="lb">enquired how he might be cleansed of his sins; {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">comforted him by telling him that the soul is not the cause
<div n="lb">of our acts, citing the ancient story Gautamī-lubdhaka-
<div n="lb">vyāla-Mṛtyu-kāla-saṃvāda {%(b),%} “This evil has neither
<div n="lb">been of thy own creation, nor of {%Duryodhana's,%} but of
<div n="lb">{%Kāla's.%}” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} became consoled (XIII, {@1@}).—§ 720:
[Page043-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if any householder had ever succeeded
<div n="lb">in conquering {%Mṛtyu%} by virtue, {%Bhīṣma%} recited the ancient
<div n="lb">story Sudarśanopākhyāna {%(b),%} “To a householder there
<div n="lb">is no higher divinity than the guest; the blessings of an
<div n="lb">honoured guest are more efficacious than the merit of
<div n="lb">100 sacrifices. Whenever a deserving guest seeks the
<div n="lb">hospitality of an householder and is not honoured by him,
<div n="lb">he takes away [with him] all the virtues of the latter,
<div n="lb">giving him his sins [in return].” Blessing upon the reader
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@2@}).—§ 721: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how the {%Kṣattriya%}
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra%} became a brahman, mentioning his destroying of
<div n="lb">the 100 sons of {%Vasiṣṭha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and comparing the
<div n="lb">instance of {%Mataṅga,%} who was born as a {%Caṇḍāla%} and could
<div n="lb">not attain to brahmanhood (XIII, {@3@}). {%Bhīṣma%} related how in
<div n="lb">olden times {%Viśvāmitra%} attained to the position of a {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">and B.-ṛ, i.e. Viśvāmitropākhyāna {%(b),%} (XIII, {@4@}).—§ 722:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to know the merits of compassion and
<div n="lb">the characteristics of devout men. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the
<div n="lb">ancient story of the discourse between {%Indra%} and the parrot
<div n="lb">(in the territories of the {%Kāśi%} king) who did not desert the
<div n="lb">blasted tree wherein it had been born, though the tree had
<div n="lb">withered, being pierced by a fowler with a poisoned arrow.
<div n="lb">The parrot, by his penances, knew {%Indra%} (who came in the
<div n="lb">shape of a brahman), and, being granted a boon, made {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">revive the tree; and after death he came to the region of
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} (XIII, {@5@}).—§ 723: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired which of
<div n="lb">the two, Exertion and Destiny, is more powerful. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">related the ancient story of the conversation of {%Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">and {%Brahmán,%} in which {%Brahmán%} showed the necessity of
<div n="lb">exertion, notwithstanding the force of destiny, under reference
<div n="lb">to the example of the gods, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Janamejaya,%} who followed
<div n="lb">in the footsteps of {%Indra,%} was checked and put down by the
<div n="lb">gods on account of his having killed a brahman woman; the
<div n="lb">{%viprarṣi Vaiśampāyana%} was put down by the gods for killing
<div n="lb">a brahman by ignorance and a child (XIII, {@6@}).—§ 724:
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} related the various fruits
<div n="lb">of various good acts. The {%Kuru%} princes became filled with
<div n="lb">wonder at his doctrine, as narrated by Ṛ. of old (XIII, {@7@}).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired who should be honoured and who
<div n="lb">liked, etc.; {%Bhīṣma's%} answer about the duty of honouring
<div n="lb">good brahmans (XIII, {@8@}).—§ 725: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} enquiry
<div n="lb">about the misery that awaits those who refuse to make gifts
<div n="lb">to brahmans after having promised to give them. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">set forth the various kinds of misery that await such men,
<div n="lb">citing the old narrative of the discourse between a jackal and
<div n="lb">an ape: While both were human beings they were intimate
<div n="lb">friends; after death one of them became a jackal and the
<div n="lb">other an ape, the former because he had not given to a
<div n="lb">brahman what he had promised to give, the latter because he
<div n="lb">used to appropriate the fruits belonging to brahmans. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">had heard this from his preceptor and from {%Kṛṣṇa%} (XIII, {@9@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 726: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to know whether any fault is
<div n="lb">incurred by one who gives instruction to a person belonging
<div n="lb">to a low caste. {%Bhīṣma%} recited what he had heard certain
<div n="lb">Ṛ. say in days of yore: instruction should not be imparted
<div n="lb">to one that belongs to a low or mean caste. He related
<div n="lb">the following instance that occurred in days of old: There
<div n="lb">was a sacred hermitage on the {%Himavat,%} inhabited by
<div n="lb">Si., Cā., {%Vālakhilyas,%} etc. (description). A {%Śūdra%} asked the
<div n="lb">head of the college {%(kulapati)%} to initiate him into a life of
<div n="lb">renunciation, but he was refused. He then, at some distance,
<div n="lb">made a hut, etc., for himself, and began to live according to
<div n="lb">rigid vows, made sacrifices to the gods, etc. (description).
[Page043-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">A Ṛ. used to come to him, and, at his request, promised to
<div n="lb">assist him in {%Pitṛ-yajña.%} As the {%Śūdra%} placed the [stool
<div n="lb">called] {%bṛsī%} towards the south with its head turned towards
<div n="lb">the west, Ṛ. told him to place the {%bṛsī%} with its head turned
<div n="lb">towards the east, and to sit with his face turned towards the
<div n="lb">north, and gave him all directions about the {%śrāddha%} as laid
<div n="lb">down in the ordinances, and after the rites had been accom-
<div n="lb">plished Ṛ. returned to his own abode. After a long time
<div n="lb">the {%Śūdra%} ascetic met with his death in those woods, and in
<div n="lb">his next life took birth in the family of a great king; the
<div n="lb">Ṛ. in his next life took birth in the family of a priest, and
<div n="lb">became well versed in the {%Atharvaveda,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the re-
<div n="lb">born {%Śūdra%} was installed king after his father's death. He
<div n="lb">appointed the reborn Ṛ. as his priest, and ruled his kingdom
<div n="lb">righteously; but every day, when he saw his priest, he
<div n="lb">smiled or laughed. The priest made him swear to tell him
<div n="lb">the truth, and he was then informed by him about their former
<div n="lb">births, where the penances of Ṛ. had all been frustrated by
<div n="lb">the instruction he had given to the {%Śūdra.%} In order that he
<div n="lb">might not obtain a still lower birth in his next life, he
<div n="lb">caused him to relinquish his present office as priest, make
<div n="lb">gifts, and observe vows, repairing to many sacred places,
<div n="lb">and at last, his soul having become purified, living in that
<div n="lb">very asylum where he had lived in his former birth,
<div n="lb">practising very severe penances; thus he succeeded in
<div n="lb">attaining to the highest success (XIII, {@10@}).—§ 727:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the nature of the man or the
<div n="lb">woman in whom the goddess of Prosperity always dwells.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the conversation between {%Rukmiṇī%} (the
<div n="lb">mother of {%Pradyumna%} with the {%Makara%} banner) and the
<div n="lb">goddess {%Śrī,%} whom she once asked this question in the
<div n="lb">presence of {%Devakī's%} son (XIII, {@11@}).—§ 728: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">enquired which of the two, man or woman, derives the
<div n="lb">greater pleasure from sexual union. {%Bhīṣma%} told the old
<div n="lb">story of the discourse between {%Bhaṅgāsvana%} and {%Śakra,%}
<div n="lb">i.e. Bhaṅgāsvanopākhyāna {%(b),%} (XIII, {@12@}).—§ 729:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how one should act in order to live happily
<div n="lb">both here and hereafter; {%Bhīṣma's%} answer indicating the
<div n="lb">chief duties of commission and omission (XIII, {@13@}).—§ 730:
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed about the
<div n="lb">different names of {%Mahādeva%} and his puissance, but soon
<div n="lb">caused {%Kṛṣṇa%} to take up the topic before the conclave of
<div n="lb">Ṛ. with {%Vyāsa,%} just as Ṛ. {%Taṇḍin,%} the offspring of {%Brahmán,%}
<div n="lb">had in days of yore told the 1,000 names of {%Mahādeva%}
<div n="lb">before {%Brahmán%} in {%Brahmaloka.%} “After twelve years
<div n="lb">had expired from the time when {%Pradyumna%} (the son of
<div n="lb">{%Rukmiṇī%}) slew the {%Asura Śambara%} in days of yore, my
<div n="lb">spouse {%Jāmbavatī%} (seeing the sons of {%Rukmiṇī—Pradyumna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Cārudeṣṇa,%} etc.) asked me to grant her a heroic son, saying:
<div n="lb">‘By worshipping {%Mahādeva%} for twelve years and emaciating
<div n="lb">thyself in observing vows, thou hast begotten the sons {%Cāru-%}
<div n="lb">{%deṣṇa,%} etc., with {%Rukmiṇī%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>).’ She prayed that {%Brahmán,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would protect me; I took leave of {%Āhuka,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">and {%Garuḍa%} bore me to {%Himavat,%} where I dismissed him;
<div n="lb">I there saw the asylum (description) of {%Upamanyu Vaiyāghra-%}
<div n="lb">{%padya,%} reverenced by D., G., and K., adorned with {%Gaṅgā,%}
<div n="lb">etc. {%Upamanyu%} directed me to devote myself to penances
<div n="lb">and gratify {%Śiva,%} here where D. and Ṛ. had in days of yore
<div n="lb">gratified him, who took his birth as Dā. {%Hiraṇyakaśipu (b),%}
<div n="lb">who was the father of {%Mandāra%} {%(c),%} irresistible even to {%Viṣṇu's%}
<div n="lb">discus {%Sudarśana (d); Śiva%} had further granted boons to the
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas%} (or {%Asuras%}) {%Vidyutprabha (e), Śatamukha (f),%} and
<div n="lb">to {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the sacrifice {%Saptakapāla,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
[Page044-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">Having narrated his former relations to {%Mahādeva, Upamanyu%}
<div n="lb">{%(g)%} there pointed out to me Si., Ṛ., V.-D., Y., G., Aps.,
<div n="lb">etc., and said that in the sixth month from that time
<div n="lb">I should behold {%Mahādeva%} and obtain twenty-four boons
<div n="lb">from him and {%Umā.%} He gave me certain {%mantras,%} by reciting
<div n="lb">which I was sure to behold {%Śaṅkara.%} On the eighth day
<div n="lb">I underwent the {%dīkṣā,%} etc. (description); for one month
<div n="lb">I lived on fruits, etc.; then I beheld {%Mahādeva%} (description)
<div n="lb">and {%Umā%} in a cloud (description), surrounded by 1,100
<div n="lb">{%Rudras,%} etc., praised by Ā., V., V.-D., A., {%Indra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">uttered the {%Rathantara Sāman%} in the presence of {%Bhava%}
<div n="lb">(Śiva). Innumerable masters of {%Yoga,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were
<div n="lb">bowing down to him; {%Sanatkumāra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were beheld
<div n="lb">by me standing there in their bodily forms; Lp., etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), were seen to bow down to {%Śiva;%} G. and Aps. sang
<div n="lb">and hymned him; V.-D., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were adoring him in
<div n="lb">thought, word, and deed; {%Brahmán, Śakra,%} etc., looked at
<div n="lb">me; I, however, had not the power to look at {%Mahādeva.%}
<div n="lb">I saluted {%Mahādeva:%} ‘Thou art,’ etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Śiva%} roared like
<div n="lb">a lion; the innumerable brahmans there present, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">bowed down to {%Śiva. Śiva,%} looking at {%Umā, Indra,%} and
<div n="lb">myself, told me to ask for eight boons” (XIII, {@14@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">went on to enumerate the eight boons, including hundreds
<div n="lb">upon hundreds of children and (granted by {%Umā%} in the name
<div n="lb">of {%Śiva%}) a son {%Śāmba.%} “{%Umā%} also granted me eight boons”
<div n="lb">(including 100 sons), “and said that I should have 16,000
<div n="lb">wives, etc.; and that 7,000 guests would daily feed at my
<div n="lb">palace. Then {%Śiva%} and {%Umā%} disappeared with their {%gaṇas.%}
<div n="lb">All this I related to {%Upamanyu%}” (XIII, {@15@}). {%Upamanyu%}
<div n="lb">said: There was in the {%Kṛta%} age a Ṛ. {%Taṇḍi%} who devoutly
<div n="lb">adored the god [Śiva] for 10,000 years. He succeeded
<div n="lb">in beholding {%Mahādeva%} and praised him (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and further
<div n="lb">said: Neither {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), know thee. {%Śiva%} said
<div n="lb">that {%Taṇḍi%} should be imperishable and eternal, etc., and
<div n="lb">his son become the author of {%Sūtras,%} etc., and granted him
<div n="lb">a boon. {%Taṇḍi%} said: Let my devotion to thee be steady.
<div n="lb">Then the god disappeared. Then {%Taṇḍi%} came to my (i.e.
<div n="lb">Upamanyu's) asylum and told me all that had happened to
<div n="lb">him. Dost thou hear all those celebrated names [of Mahā-
<div n="lb">deva] that {%Taṇḍi%} said unto me. {%Brahmán%} had at one time
<div n="lb">enumerated 10,000 names of {%Mahādeva;%} in the scriptures
<div n="lb">1,000 names of him occur. They are not known to all, but
<div n="lb">were uttered in days of yore by {%Brahmán%} for the purpose
<div n="lb">of adoring {%Śiva.%} Having acquired them by the favour of
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán, Taṇḍi%} communicated them to me (XIII, {@16@}).
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said: “B.-ṛ. {%Upamanyu%} said: I shall adore [Śiva]
<div n="lb">with names uttered by {%Brahmán;%} Ṛ., in the {%Vedas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Vedāṅgas,%} applied by {%Taṇḍi,%} etc. [i.e. Mahādeva-sahasra-
<div n="lb">nāma-stotra].” Blessing upon the reader; “Dā., Y.,
<div n="lb">Rā., Pś., {%Yātudhānas,%} and Gh. can do no injury to him”
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@17@}). {%Vyāsa%} told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to gratify {%Śiva%} with
<div n="lb">this hymn consisting of 1,008 names; {%Vyāsa%} had himself
<div n="lb">recited it in former days, when engaged in penances on {%Meru%}
<div n="lb">in order to obtain a son, and he had obtained the fulfilment
<div n="lb">of all his wishes. After this {%Kapila,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), obtained
<div n="lb">boons from {%Śiva.%} Then {%[Rāma] Jāmadagnya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">narrated to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the boons they had been granted by
<div n="lb">{%Śiva. Vaiśampāyana%} continued: Hearing these marvellous
<div n="lb">feats of {%Mahādeva%} related by the ascetics, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">became amazed. Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira: Upa-%}
<div n="lb">{%manyu%} said to me: Unrighteous men, stained by {%Rajas%}
<div n="lb">and {%Tamas,%} do not succeed in attaining to {%Īśāna%} (Śiva);
<div n="lb">even if a person lives in the enjoyment of every pleasure
[Page044-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and luxury, yet he comes to be regarded as the equal of
<div n="lb">pure-minded forest recluses if he is devoted to the Supreme
<div n="lb">Deity; if {%Rudra%} is pleased with a person, he can confer
<div n="lb">upon him the position of either {%Brahmán%} or {%Keśava%} or
<div n="lb">{%Śakra%} with all the deities under him, or the sovereignty
<div n="lb">of the three worlds; a person who devastates the whole
<div n="lb">universe does not become stained with sin if he adores and
<div n="lb">worships {%Śiva…%} Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira:%}
<div n="lb">{%Āditya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), have sprung from that creator of all
<div n="lb">creatures (Śiva); indeed, that subtle {%Brahmán%} is the cause
<div n="lb">of life. Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@18@}). [§ 730,
<div n="lb">i.e. XIII, {@14—18,@} is called {%Meghavāhanopākhyāna.%}]—§ 731:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the purport of the scriptural
<div n="lb">injunction to husband and wife about the joint performance
<div n="lb">of all duties. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the
<div n="lb">discourse between {%Aṣṭāvakra%} and {%Diśā,%} i.e. Aṣṭāvakra-
<div n="lb">Dik-saṃvāda {%(b),%} (XIII, {@19—21@}).—§ 732: Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the question who is
<div n="lb">worthy of receiving gifts, etc., quoting Ṛ. {%Mārkaṇḍeya,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), (XIII, {@22@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
<div n="lb">the ordinances regulating the actions to be perpetrated towards
<div n="lb">the deities and the {%Pitṛs%} on the occasions of {%śrāddhas:%} “One
<div n="lb">should carefully perform all acts relating to the deities in the
<div n="lb">forenoon, and all acts relating to the {%Pitṛs%} in the afternoon;
<div n="lb">that gift that is made untimely, etc., is appropriated by
<div n="lb">Rā.”; the brahmans that must not be invited to {%śrāddhas,%}
<div n="lb">and those that should be invited, etc.; {%Jātakarman,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@23@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
<div n="lb">the circumstances under which a person may become guilty
<div n="lb">of brahmanicide without actually slaying a brahman (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@24@}).—§ 733: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the holy places
<div n="lb">on earth, {%Bhīṣma%} repeated the enumeration of them {%(a)%}
<div n="lb">made by {%Aṅgiras%} to {%Gautama,%} who put this same question,

<div n="lb">of repairing to all the {%tīrthas%} in the world, one should
<div n="lb">mentally think of those amongst them that are wholly or

<div n="lb">from {%Kaśyapa.%} Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@25@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 734: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Though equal unto {%Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">in intelligence, {%Brahmán%} in forgiveness, {%Indra%} in progress,
<div n="lb">and {%Sūrya%} in energy, {%Bhīṣma%} (the son of {%Gaṅgā%}) had
<div n="lb">been overthrown in battle by {%Arjuna.%} Accompanied by his
<div n="lb">brothers, etc., {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked him these questions. He
<div n="lb">was lying on a bed of arrows in expectation of the time of
<div n="lb">death. Many M.-ṛ. had come there to see him: {%Atri,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his brothers duly worshipped those Ṛ.,
<div n="lb">who then sat down and conversed about {%Bhīṣma%} (who
<div n="lb">became delighted), and then, taking leave of {%Bhīṣma%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} made themselves invisible. The {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">then waited upon {%Bhīṣma,%} and seeing the quarters of the
<div n="lb">sky blazing forth with splendour on account of the penances
<div n="lb">of the {%Ṛṣis,%} they became filled with wonder, and talked it
<div n="lb">over with {%Bhīṣma. Vaiśampāyana%} continued: After that
[Page045-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">conversation was over, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} touched {%Bhīṣma's%} feet
<div n="lb">with his head, and then resumed his questions relating to
<div n="lb">morality and righteousness. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked which
<div n="lb">countries, retreats, mountains, and rivers are foremost in
<div n="lb">point of sanctity. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of
<div n="lb">a conversation between a brahman who was a {%śiloñcha-vṛtti%}
<div n="lb">(subsisting upon gleanings) (or {%śilavṛtti%}) householder and
<div n="lb">a {%siddha%} (crowned with ascetic success) Ṛ., who roamed
<div n="lb">over the earth and once had passed the night in the house
<div n="lb">of the {%śilavṛtti,%} who, when they had conversed on subjects
<div n="lb">connected with the {%Vedas%} and {%Upaniṣads,%} asked him this
<div n="lb">very question, and was instructed by him about the superior
<div n="lb">sanctity of {%Gaṅgā.%} Then the {%siddha%} ascended the firmament,
<div n="lb">and the {%śilavṛtti%} sought the protection of {%Gaṅgā%} and attained
<div n="lb">to great success. {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc., were filled with
<div n="lb">delight. Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@26@}).—§ 735:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how a {%Kṣattriya, Vaiśya,%} or {%Śūdra%} may
<div n="lb">acquire the position of a brahman. {%Bhīṣma%} said that the
<div n="lb">brahmanhood cannot be acquired except by birth, relating
<div n="lb">an old story of a conversation between {%Mataṅga%} and a she-
<div n="lb">ass, etc., i.e. {%Indra-Mataṅga-saṃvāda (b),%} (XIII, {@27—29@}).—

<div n="lb">asked how king {%Vītahavya%} in ancient times succeeded in
<div n="lb">obtaining brahmanhood. {%Bhīṣma%} told the Vītahavyo-
<div n="lb">pākhyāna {%(b),%} (XIII, {@30@}).—§ 737: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">as to who are worthy of reverent homage, {%Bhīṣma%} repeated
<div n="lb">the old narrative of the discourse between {%Nārada%} and

<div n="lb">answered: “I worship them who constantly worship {%Varuṇa,%}
<div n="lb">etc.” {%(a),%} (XIII, {@31@}).—§ 738: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about
<div n="lb">the merits of those persons who grant protection to living

<div n="lb">the most important of all those that have been laid down for
<div n="lb">a king, {%Bhīṣma%} said it was the worship of {%brahmans;%} they
<div n="lb">are older than P., D., men, U., and Rā., and incapable of
<div n="lb">being vanquished by D., P., G., Rā., As., or Pś.; it is owing
<div n="lb">to the absence of {%brahmans%} that the {%Kṣattriya%} tribes, the
<div n="lb">{%Śakas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), have become degraded into the state of
<div n="lb">{%Śūdras;%} the great Ṛ. have said that brahmanicide is
<div n="lb">a heinous sin (XIII, {@33@}); they have {%Soma%} for their king;
<div n="lb">“this was said to me by {%Nārada%}”; {%Āditya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), enter
<div n="lb">the body of the brahman and take what the brahman eats;

<div n="lb">“in this connection the old story of the conversation

<div n="lb">of {%brahmans;%} the {%Mekalas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and numerous other
<div n="lb">{%kṣattriya%} tribes have become degraded to the state of

<div n="lb">discourse between {%Śakra%} (in the guise of an ascetic—
<div n="lb">description—on an ugly car) and As. {%Śambara,%} who ascribed
<div n="lb">his success to his never cherishing any ill-feeling towards the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans,%} referring to the encounter between D. and As. in
<div n="lb">days of old; {%Śambara's%} father had obtained instruction from
[Page045-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Candramas%} ({%Soma,%} the Moon) as to how the {%brahmans%}
<div n="lb">attain to success. {%Śakra%} began to worship the {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">and therefore succeeded in obtaining the supremacy of
<div n="lb">the gods (XIII, {@36@}).—§ 741: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} discussed the comparative eligibility of {%brahmans%} for
<div n="lb">receiving presents; “one pays off the debt one owes to
<div n="lb">the gods by performing sacrifices, to P. by procreating
<div n="lb">children, to the {%brahmans%} by making presents unto them,
<div n="lb">and to the guests by feeding them” (XIII, {@37@}).—§ 742:
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the disposition of women (who
<div n="lb">are said to be the root of all evil and exceedingly frail),
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} told the old story of the discourse between D.-ṛ.
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} and the courtezan Aps. {%Iañcacūḍā,%} in ancient times,
<div n="lb">in the region of {%Brahmán%} ({%Brāhmīṃ,%} so PCR.), (XIII, {@38@}).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} observed that women are in possession of the
<div n="lb">illusive power of As. {%Śambara,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the political
<div n="lb">knowledge of {%Śukra%} and {%Bṛhaspati;%} “it seems to me that
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} and other great thinkers evolved the science of
<div n="lb">politics from observation of the understanding of women”
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@39@}).—§ 743: {%Bhīṣma%} approved of what {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">had said: “There is no creature more sinful than woman;
<div n="lb">she is the illusion that Dai. {%Maya%} created, etc.; I am told
<div n="lb">that all persons of the human race in course of natural progress
<div n="lb">attain to the state of gods; this circumstance alarmed the gods;
<div n="lb">they repaired to {%Brahmán,%} who created women by an {%Atharvan%}
<div n="lb">rite; in a previous creation women were all virtuous; but
<div n="lb">those that sprang from this creation by {%Brahmán%} with
<div n="lb">the aid of an illusion became sinful; {%Brahmán%} bestowed the
<div n="lb">desire of enjoying all kinds of carnal pleasures upon them.”
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} repeated the old story of how, in days of yore,
<div n="lb">{%Vipula%} had succeeded in restraining his preceptor's spouse,
<div n="lb">i.e. Vipulopākhyāna {%(b),%} (XIII, {@40—43@}).—§ 744: Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained upon what person one
<div n="lb">should bestow one's daughter in marriage; the different
<div n="lb">forms of marriage (<lang n="greek"></lang>); various ordinances about marriage,
<div n="lb">quoting {%Prajāpati%} and {%Manu%} and the {%Maruts%} and the {%Ṛṣis;%}
<div n="lb">what constitutes or completes the union of marriage; the
<div n="lb">passing and acceptance of a dower do not constitute marriage.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} referred to the opinion of {%Bāhlīka%} and his own conduct
<div n="lb">in liberating {%Ambā,%} whom he had abducted for his brother
<div n="lb">{%Vicitravīrya,%} having defeated the {%Māgadhas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), quoting
<div n="lb">prince {%Satyavat%} (XIII, {@44@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">expounded how a girl's kinsmen should act after having received
<div n="lb">a dower if the giver goes away without marrying and does not
<div n="lb">return for some time, comparing the instance of {%Sāvitrī%} and
<div n="lb">quoting {%Sukratu%} (the grandson of the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka%});
<div n="lb">the unrighteous dereliction of eternal usage is regarded as
<div n="lb">the practice of the {%Asuras.%} Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} upon what
<div n="lb">authority the wealth of men is inherited by others when they
<div n="lb">happen to have daughters, {%Bhīṣma%} explained the different
<div n="lb">rules of succession, and recited some verses sung in days
<div n="lb">of yore by {%Yama%} about the man who sells his son or bestows
<div n="lb">his daughter for a dower (he has to sink into seven terrible
<div n="lb">hells named {%Kāla%}); the {%Ārṣa%} marriage is also a sale; “even
<div n="lb">a human being with whom one has no relationship of blood
<div n="lb">should not form the subject of sale” (XIII, {@45@}); a verse of
<div n="lb">[Dakṣa] {%Prācetasa;%} how women should be treated; “those
<div n="lb">houses that are cursed by women meet with destruction and
<div n="lb">ruin as if scorched by some {%Atharvan%} rite”; {%Manu,%} on the

<div n="lb">and protection of men; a verse sung by a princess of the
<div n="lb">house of the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka%} on the duties of women
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@46@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
[Page046-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the comparative eligibility of different kinds of sons to the
<div n="lb">father's inheritance, quoting {%Manu%} and Ṛ., and M.-ṛ.
<div n="lb">{%Kaśyapa%} (B. {%Kā°%}) {%Mārīca;%} “if a brahman, led by lust,

<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed the duties of persons born
<div n="lb">in the mixed castes; in the beginning {%Prajāpati%} created
<div n="lb">the four castes for the sake of sacrifice; the son begotten by
<div n="lb">a {%brahman%} upon a {%Śūdra%} wife is called {%Pāraśava%} (etymology);
<div n="lb">a {%Kṣattriya's%} son with a {%Śūdra%} wife is called an {%Ugra,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); only the duties of the four principal castes have
<div n="lb">been laid down in the scriptures; as regards the others,
<div n="lb">the scriptures are entirely silent. Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} discussed the signs by which the origin of men
<div n="lb">of impure birth may be known (XIII, {@48@}). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed the different kinds of
<div n="lb">sons: {%Niruktaja,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), (XIII, {@49@}).—§ 745: Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about compassion, etc., {%Bhīṣma%} told the
<div n="lb">ancient story of a conversation between {%Nahuṣa%} and
<div n="lb">M.-ṛ. {%Cyavana,%} i.e. Cyavanopākhyāna {%(b),%} including
<div n="lb">Cyavana-Kuśika-saṃvāda (XIII, {@50—56@}).—§ 746:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} became stupefied with grief at the thought of
<div n="lb">the millions of men he had slaughtered; he feared that the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} would have to sink in hell, their heads hanging
<div n="lb">downwards, and desired to practise severe penances. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">expounded the different rewards of different kinds of acts.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} desired to attain the end that is reserved
<div n="lb">to heroes, and no longer expressed any disgust at leading
<div n="lb">a householder's mode of life, and all the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} approved of his words (XIII, {@57@}). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} spoke of the rewards attached to
<div n="lb">the planting of trees and the digging of wells and tanks;
<div n="lb">D., men, G., P., U., and Rā., etc., all resort to a tank
<div n="lb">full of water as their refuge; the same and Ṛ. all have
<div n="lb">recourse to trees (XIII, {@58@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} discussed what gift is distinguished before all other
<div n="lb">gifts (XIII, {@59@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
<div n="lb">which gift is more meritorious, that bestowed on one who
<div n="lb">asks for it or that given to an unsoliciting person (XIII, {@60@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained where one meets
<div n="lb">with the rewards attached to gifts and sacrifices, adducing
<div n="lb">the instances of king {%Śibi%} and {%Manu%} (XIII, {@61@}). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what is the best of all gifts, {%Bhīṣma%} declared
<div n="lb">it to be earth (called, therefore, {%Priyadattā%}); {%Mṛtyu,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), are incapable of touching the person that makes a gift
<div n="lb">of earth; the verse hearing which {%[Rāma] Jāmadagnya%} gave
<div n="lb">away the whole earth to {%Kaśyapa%} is quoted; a gift of
<div n="lb">earth is a high expiation for the sin of those who betake
<div n="lb">themselves to {%Atharvan%} rites in order to do injuries to
<div n="lb">others; Ā., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), applaud the man who makes
<div n="lb">a gift of earth; he further told the old narrative of
<div n="lb">a discourse between {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Indra:%} having adored
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu%} in 100 sacrifices, {%Indra%} put this same question to
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati,%} and was instructed by him; “that man who does
<div n="lb">not keep a promise of a gift of earth, or who recalls it, is
<div n="lb">tied with the noose of {%Varuṇa%} at the command of Death;
<div n="lb">those men have never to go to {%Yama%} who honour and
<div n="lb">worship brahmans, etc.”; that king who makes gifts of
<div n="lb">earth sports in bliss in heaven, adored by D. and G., and
<div n="lb">is approached by 100 Aps., etc. {%Indra%} gave the whole
<div n="lb">earth to {%Bṛhaspati;%} if these verses are recited at a {%śrāddha%}
<div n="lb">neither Rā. nor As. can succeed in appropriating any
<div n="lb">share of the offerings made (XIII, {@62@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣ-%}
[Page046-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%ṭhira%} as to what gifts kings should make, what gifts
<div n="lb">immediately gratify the brahmans, what fruits attach to
<div n="lb">them, what gifts are productive of rewards both here and
<div n="lb">hereafter, {%Bhīṣma%} related the answer he had received from
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} when he put the same question to him: a gift of food
<div n="lb">made to even a {%Cāṇḍāla%} or a dog is never lost; in a former
<div n="lb">{%Kalpa (purā kalpe) Prajāpati%} said that food is {%amṛta,%} etc.;
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} and {%Soma%} in the body create and maintain the vital
<div n="lb">seed; thus the sun and wind {%(Pavanaḥ)%} and the vital seed
<div n="lb">spring and act from food; description of the regions of
<div n="lb">heaven reserved to those that make gifts of food (XIII, {@63@}).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the conjunctions of the planets
<div n="lb">and stars in relation to gifts. {%Bhīṣma%} repeated the ancient
<div n="lb">narrative of the discourse between {%Devakī%} and Ṛ. {%Nārada%} at
<div n="lb">{%Dvārakā,%} where {%Nārada%} answered this very question. {%Devakī%}
<div n="lb">in her turn told it to her daughters-in-law (XIII, {@64@}).
<div n="lb">Various merits of various kinds of gifts, {%Bhīṣma%} referring to
<div n="lb">{%Atri,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); ghee is said to gratify {%Bṛhaspati,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@65@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} commented on the
<div n="lb">gift of sandals and shoes, and of sesame, and land, and kine,
<div n="lb">and food; sesame seeds were created by {%Brahmán%} as the best
<div n="lb">food of the {%Pitṛs,%} etc.; {%Āpastamba.%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), have all ascended
<div n="lb">to heaven by means of making gifts of sesame seeds. Once the
<div n="lb">gods, desirous of performing a sacrifice on the earth, repaired
<div n="lb">to {%Brahmán%} on the {%Himavat%} and obtained from him a clod of
<div n="lb">earth (which the {%munis%} should always adore); there came
<div n="lb">{%Agastya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the gods attached one-sixth of the merit
<div n="lb">arising from their sacrifice to the gift of earth; in days of
<div n="lb">yore king {%Rantideva%} performed a grand sacrifice, in which an
<div n="lb">immense number of kine were slaughtered; from the juice of
<div n="lb">their skins the river {%Carmaṇvatī%} was formed; king {%Rantideva,%}
<div n="lb">in days of yore, ascended to heaven on account of his having
<div n="lb">given gifts of food; the cow should never be given away for
<div n="lb">slaughter; what kine should not be given to brahmans; he
<div n="lb">referred to {%Parāśara;%} the seasons when gifts of food produce
<div n="lb">particular merits (XIII, {@66@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣhṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} dealt with the merits that attach to gifts of
<div n="lb">drink, quoting {%Sāvitrī%} and {%Lomaśa%} and {%Manu,%} and mentioning
<div n="lb">{%Śibi; Soma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), has sprung from water; D. have {%amṛta%}
<div n="lb">for their food, N. have {%Sudhā,%} P. have {%Svadhā%} (XIII, {@67@}).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked about the merits that attach to gifts of
<div n="lb">sesame and lamps for lighting darkness, as also of food and
<div n="lb">robes; {%Bhīṣma%} told the narrative of the conversation between
<div n="lb">a brahman and {%Yama,%} in ancient times, in the large town
<div n="lb">of {%Parṇaśālā%} (inhabited by brahmans) between {%Yamunā%} and
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā,%} at the foot of the {%Yamunā%} hills; one day {%Yama%}
<div n="lb">commanded a messenger of his (description) to bring the
<div n="lb">person named {%Śarmin%} of {%Agastya's%} race from this town
<div n="lb">{%(Agastyaṃ gotrataḥ),%} not confounding him with another of
<div n="lb">the same {%gotra;%} he should be worshipped with respect. The
<div n="lb">messenger did the very reverse; {%Yama%} ordered this man to
<div n="lb">be taken back and {%Śarmin%} to be brought; the former was,
<div n="lb">however, first instructed by {%Yama%} regarding gifts. Then
<div n="lb">the messenger conveyed him back and fetched {%Śarmin;%}
<div n="lb">{%Yama,%} having given him the same instructions, dismissed
<div n="lb">him to be taken back to his abode. The giver of a lamp
<div n="lb">is regarded as benefiting the {%Pitṛs%} and {%Yama;%} it enhances
<div n="lb">the power of vision of D., P., and one's self; citing {%Manu%}
<div n="lb">about a gift of gems (XIII, {@68@}). {%Bhīṣma,%} at {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
<div n="lb">solicitation, reverted to the topic of the merits of gifts, with
<div n="lb">especial reference to the gift of earth; a cow should never be
<div n="lb">given to a person that is not righteous (XIII, {@69@}). The tale
<div n="lb">of the calamity that befell king {%Nṛga,%} who had unwittingly
[Page047-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">taken a cow belonging to a brahman and given it away to
<div n="lb">another brahman. Formerly, when {%Dvāravatī%} was founded
<div n="lb">(read with B. {%niviśantyām%}), a huge lizard was seen (or met
<div n="lb">with?) in a well; {%Kṛṣṇa%} took it out and learnt that it was
<div n="lb">king {%Nṛga,%} who in days of old had performed many sacrifices
<div n="lb">and repeatedly made gifts of hundreds upon hundreds of
<div n="lb">thousands of kine to the brahmans; a brahman's cow had
<div n="lb">accidentally come among {%Nṛga's%} and been given to another
<div n="lb">brahman, whose weak child it nourished; neither of them
<div n="lb">would take the most exorbitant gifts in exchange; after death,
<div n="lb">when he came to the region of the {%Pitṛs, Yama%} let him choose
<div n="lb">as his punishment for this little sin to become a lizard for
<div n="lb">1,000 years, till he was rescued by {%Vāsudeva.%} Then {%Nṛga%}
<div n="lb">mounted a celestial car and proceeded to heaven; a verse
<div n="lb">of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} is quoted (XIII, {@70@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} to further detail the merits attainable by gifts
<div n="lb">of kine. {%Bhīṣma%} told the old story of Ṛ. {%Uddālaki%} and
<div n="lb">his son {%Nāciketa,%} whom he had cursed to go and see {%Yama,%}
<div n="lb">because {%Nāciketa%} had not found the articles (enumeration) he
<div n="lb">was sent for, as they had been washed away by the current.
<div n="lb">{%Nāciketa%} fell down, deprived of life; {%Uddālaki%} indulged in
<div n="lb">lamentations; when the night came, {%Nāciketa,%} drenched with
<div n="lb">his father's tears, revived, and in the midst of the {%Ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">told that he had been honoured in {%Yama's%} delightful palace,
<div n="lb">which extended over 1,000 {%yojanas;%} “{%Yama%} said that I was
<div n="lb">not dead, but had only come to see {%Yama%} in compliance
<div n="lb">with the words of my father”; {%Yama,%} at his request,
<div n="lb">had caused him to be mounted on a vehicle and showed
<div n="lb">him all those delightful regions that are reserved for the
<div n="lb">righteous (description), who make gifts in the world of men,
<div n="lb">especially gifts of kine, etc. (considerations of propriety or
<div n="lb">otherwise); in the absence of kine, a person by making gifts
<div n="lb">of a substitute of kine (e.g. a cow made of ghee) wins the
<div n="lb">merit of making gifts of kine; gifts of kine on {%kāmyāṣṭamī,%}
<div n="lb">etc.; “I then took leave of {%Yama%} and have now come back”
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@71@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked about the regions of kine,
<div n="lb">which are the residence of givers of kine. {%Bhīṣma%} related
<div n="lb">the old tale of the conversation between {%Brahmán%} and {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">who, seeing that the residents of the regions of kine surpassed
<div n="lb">the denizens of heaven, asked {%Brahmán%} about them (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@72@}). The comments of {%Brahmán%} to {%Indra%} on the subject of
<div n="lb">kine, reference being made to {%Ṛṣis,%} etc. (XIII, {@73@}). Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Indra, Brahmán%} spoke about the end of him who consciously
<div n="lb">steals a cow or sells one from motives of cupidity. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">explained how {%Brahmán's%} discourse had been handed down
<div n="lb">from {%Indra%} to {%Bhīṣma: Brahmán > Indra > Daśaratha > Rāma%}
<div n="lb">[Dāśarathi] > {%Lakṣmaṇa >%} the {%Ṛṣis%} (while dwelling in the
<div n="lb">woods) > from generation to generation > {%Bhīṣma's%} preceptor
<div n="lb">> {%Bhīṣma.%} Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@74@}). Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained the rewards that attach
<div n="lb">to the observance of different kinds of vows; many millions
<div n="lb">of Ṛ. are residing in {%Brahmaloka%} (XIII, {@75@}). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} commented upon the ordinances that
<div n="lb">regulate gifts of kine, quoting the instruction given by
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} to king {%Māndhātṛ;%} “kine have that in them that
<div n="lb">partakes of the nature of both {%Sūrya%} and {%Soma%}”; application
<div n="lb">of the words {%bhavitavyā,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); all the three [cow-givers],
<div n="lb">etc., and he who is well conversant with the {%Mahābhārata%}
<div n="lb">attain to the regions of {%Viṣṇu%} and {%Soma;%} names of kings
<div n="lb">who have attained to regions of great felicity as the reward
<div n="lb">of such gifts of kine as they made according to the
<div n="lb">instructions of {%Bṛhaspati: Uśīnara,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).—{%Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">said: King {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} did all that {%Bhīṣma%} wished; he
[Page047-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">from that time began always to make gifts of kine and to
<div n="lb">support himself on grains of barley and on cow-dung as his
<div n="lb">food and drink, and he began to sleep from that day on
<div n="lb">the bare earth, and gave up the practice of harnessing
<div n="lb">kine to his vehicles, and used cars drawn by horses (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@76@}). {%Vaiśampāyana%} continued: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} once more went into detail on the merits attaching
<div n="lb">to the gift of kine: a {%Kapilā%} cow is the best of all kine;
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked why; {%Bhīṣma%} said he had heard old
<div n="lb">men tell the following story: In days of yore {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">commanded {%Dakṣa%} to create living creatures; {%Dakṣa,%} in
<div n="lb">the first instance, created food; he drank {%amṛta,%} a fragrant
<div n="lb">eructation came out, and gave birth to the cow {%Surabhi,%}
<div n="lb">whose daughters came to be regarded as the mothers of the
<div n="lb">world; they were all {%Kapilās;%} some froth from the calves
<div n="lb">fell upon the head of {%Mahādeva,%} who, filled with wrath,
<div n="lb">turned his third eye towards them, which produced various
<div n="lb">complexions in them; some escaped to the region of {%Soma%}
<div n="lb">and retained their colour. {%Dakṣa%} informed {%Śiva%} that this
<div n="lb">froth was {%amṛta%} and not impure; {%Candramas%} (the Moon),
<div n="lb">after drinking the {%amṛta,%} pours it out again; but it is
<div n="lb">not, on that account, regarded as impure. {%Dakṣa%} then
<div n="lb">presented {%Mahādeva%} with a bull and certain kine; {%Mahā-%}
<div n="lb">{%deva%} was gratified and made that bull his vehicle, and after
<div n="lb">the form of that bull adopted the device on his standard; it
<div n="lb">was on that occasion also that the gods, uniting together,
<div n="lb">made {%Mahādeva%} the lord of animals. Cows yield {%Soma%} in the
<div n="lb">form of milk. Blessing upon the reader.—{%Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">continued: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brother began to make gifts
<div n="lb">of both bulls and cows of different colours to brahmans,
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} performing many sacrifices (XIII, {@78@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">said: In days of yore, king {%Saudāsa%} of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race
<div n="lb">asked his {%purohita%} Ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha%} what is most sacred and
<div n="lb">most productive of merit; {%Vasiṣṭha%} enlarged upon the
<div n="lb">mystery relating to kine; {%svāhā%} and {%vaṣaṭ%} are for ever
<div n="lb">established in kine; what is meant by {%Gomatī%} (XIII, {@78@}).
<div n="lb">Continuation of {%Vasiṣṭha's%} discourse on the pre-eminent
<div n="lb">sanctity of kine; the diverse merits attaching to gifts of
<div n="lb">different kinds of kine: {%Brahmaloka,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), (XIII, {@79@}).
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha%} commented on the purificatory {%mantras%} having
<div n="lb">reference to kine; “those who make gifts of 1,000 kine,
<div n="lb">departing from this world, proceed to the region of G. and
<div n="lb">Aps., where there are many palatial mansions made of gold,
<div n="lb">and {%Vasor dhārā%} (i.e. Mandākinī, Nīl.);… by giving
<div n="lb">away a {%Kapilā%} cow, etc., one succeeds in entering the palace
<div n="lb">of {%Yama%} that is so difficult to enter.”—{%Bhīṣma%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Saudāsa,%} honouring these words of Ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha,%} made gifts
<div n="lb">of a very large number of kine unto the brahmans, and
<div n="lb">attained to many worlds of felicity in the next life (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@80@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what is the most sacred of all
<div n="lb">sacred things in the world, and which is the highest of
<div n="lb">all sanctifying objects. {%Bhīṣma%} said: Kine are the most
<div n="lb">excellent of all objects, etc.; {%Māndhātṛ,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), always
<div n="lb">used to give away kine in thousands, and have attained to
<div n="lb">such regions as are unattainable even by the gods; he quoted
<div n="lb">a discourse delivered of old. {%Śuka%} (having finished his morning
<div n="lb">observances) asked Ṛ. {%Vyāsa%} what is the foremost of all
<div n="lb">sacrifices, and was instructed by him, who praised kine and
<div n="lb">described the region of kine which the blessed only attain;
<div n="lb">Aps. always entertain them there; those regions that have
<div n="lb">for their lords {%Pūṣan%} and the {%Maruts%} are attained to by givers
<div n="lb">of kine; they attain to wealth like that of {%Varuṇa%} himself;
<div n="lb">one should daily recite these {%mantras%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) declared by {%Prajāpati%}
[Page048-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">himself. [In this section {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} has repeatedly been
<div n="lb">addressed instead of {%Śuka.%}] The man who, for a month,
<div n="lb">subsists upon the gruel of barley picked up every day from
<div n="lb">cow-dung, becomes free of sins as grave as the slaughter
<div n="lb">of a brahman: after their defeat at the hands of Dai., the
<div n="lb">gods practised this penance, owing to which they regained
<div n="lb">their position; the efficaciousness of the {%Gomatī mantras.—%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: From that time {%Śuka%} began to worship kine
<div n="lb">every day (XIII, {@81@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how it is that
<div n="lb">the dung of the cow is possessed of {%Śrī. Bhīṣma%} told
<div n="lb">the old story of the conversation between the kine and
<div n="lb">{%Śrī,%} who once in a beautiful form entered a herd of cows,
<div n="lb">saying: “The {%Daityas,%} forsaken by me, have been lost
<div n="lb">for ever; the gods {%Indra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), having obtained me,
<div n="lb">are sporting in joy and will do so for ever; Ṛ. and
<div n="lb">D. only when they are favoured by me become crowned
<div n="lb">with success”; she wished to reside in the kine;
<div n="lb">they refused her, saying she was fickle and restless. {%Śrī%}
<div n="lb">said: “D., Dā., G., Pś., U., Rā., and men succeed in
<div n="lb">obtaining me only after the severest austerities”; they agreed
<div n="lb">that she should live in their urine and dung (XIII, {@82@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} continued his discourse on kine, repeating the old
<div n="lb">tale of the discourse between {%Brahmán%} and {%Indra,%} after
<div n="lb">Dai. had been defeated and all creatures grew in prosperity;
<div n="lb">then once Ṛ., G., K., U., Rā., D., As., the birds, and the
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpatis%} all adored {%Brahmán; Nārada,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), sang, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Indra%} asked him about the region of kine; {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">said that {%Indra%} had always disregarded kine, and commented
<div n="lb">to him on the superiority of kine. He explained to him why
<div n="lb">kine have descended to earth: In days of yore, when in the
<div n="lb">{%Deva-yuga%} the {%Dānavas%} became lords of the three worlds,
<div n="lb">{%Aditi%} underwent the severest austerities (standing upon one
<div n="lb">leg for many years) and begot {%Viṣṇu;%} seeing {%Aditi%} perform
<div n="lb">penances, {%Surabhī,%} the daughter of {%Dakṣa,%} also underwent
<div n="lb">austerities on {%Kailāsa%} (resorted to by D. and G.), in {%yoga,%}
<div n="lb">standing upon one leg for 11,000 years; “D., Ṛ., and M.-U.
<div n="lb">became scorched and repaired thither with me (Brahmán); as
<div n="lb">she did not herself ask a favour, I granted her the boon of
<div n="lb">immortality, and that she should dwell in {%Goloka,%} while her
<div n="lb">offspring, engaged in doing good acts, would reside in the world
<div n="lb">of men (description of {%Goloka%}).” {%Bhīṣma%} continued: From
<div n="lb">that time {%Śakra%} began to worship kine every day. Blessing
<div n="lb">upon the reader, etc. (XIII, {@83@}).—§ 747: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">asked why gold, in the {%Śrutis,%} is declared to be even superior
<div n="lb">to kine as a {%dakṣiṇā,%} and what gold is, etc. {%Bhīṣma%} related
<div n="lb">the circumstances connected with the origin of gold: “When
<div n="lb">my father {%Śāntanu%} was dead, I went to {%Gaṅgādvāra%} to
<div n="lb">perform his {%śrāddha; Gaṅgā%} came and rendered me great
<div n="lb">help (description); a handsome arm, adorned with {%aṅgadas,%}
<div n="lb">etc., rose up piercing the ground; the P. did not come in
<div n="lb">their visible forms to take the cake; I, therefore, dis-
<div n="lb">regarding the hand, offered the whole cake on blades of
<div n="lb">{%kuśa%}-grass, according to rule; then the arm of my father
<div n="lb">vanished. In that night the {%Pitṛs%} appeared to me in
<div n="lb">a dream, pleased by my adherence to the rules, whereby
<div n="lb">I had honoured the authority of the scriptures, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">I had made gifts of earth and kine; now I should make gifts
<div n="lb">of gold. Listen now to this old story, that extends the
<div n="lb">period of life for him who listens to it; it was first recited to
<div n="lb">{%Rāma Jāmadagnya,%} who in former days exterminated the
<div n="lb">{%Kṣattriyas%} twenty-one times; by performing a horse-sacrifice
<div n="lb">he became free from sin, but he still failed to attain to perfect
<div n="lb">lightness of heart; he repaired to Ṛ. and D., then to
[Page048-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); they told him that in days of yore {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">burnt all the world; from his seed sprang gold; he should
<div n="lb">make gifts of gold; {%Vasiṣṭha%} in especial commented on gold:
<div n="lb">it is the essence of {%Agni%} and {%Soma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); such is the
<div n="lb">teaching of the {%Smṛtis;%} in churning the entire universe
<div n="lb">a mass of energy (i.e. gold) was found; hence gold is
<div n="lb">superior; D., G., U., Rā., men, and Pś. keep it with care;
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} is all the deities in one, and {%Agni%} is the essence of
<div n="lb">gold. I formerly heard this in the {%Purāṇa;%} it represents the
<div n="lb">speech of {%Prajāpati%} himself.” Then he related Suvarṇot-
<div n="lb">patti {%(b),%} (XIII, {@84—85@}).—§ 748: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">(who refers to § 747{%b%}), {%Bhīṣma%} related Tārakavadho-
<div n="lb">pākhyāna {%(b),%} (XIII, {@86@}).—§ 749: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">(who perhaps refers to § 641 = XII, {@60@} ff.), {%Bhīṣma%} ex-
<div n="lb">plained the ordinances respecting the {%śrāddha.%} D., As., men,
<div n="lb">G., Pś., K., every one should always worship P. P. are
<div n="lb">worshipped before the gods. The merits and demerits of the
<div n="lb">different lunar days for performing the {%śrāddha:%} 1st-13th
<div n="lb">days of the bright fortnight are auspicious; all the young men
<div n="lb">in the family of him who performs it on the 14th day meet
<div n="lb">with death, and he himself becomes entangled in war; the day
<div n="lb">of the new moon and 10th-13th days of the dark fortnight
<div n="lb">are auspicious; the dark fortnight is better than the bright
<div n="lb">one, the afternoon better than the forenoon (XIII, {@87@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained what, if presented
<div n="lb">to P., becomes inexhaustible and eternal, and the periods for
<div n="lb">which different offerings presented at {%śrāddhas%} gratify the P.,
<div n="lb">quoting some verses [originally] sung by P. and communicated
<div n="lb">to him by {%Sanatkumāra,%} recommending {%pāyasa%} with ghee on
<div n="lb">the 13th day [of the dark fortnight, PCR.] under {%Maghāḥ%}
<div n="lb">during the Sun's southward course, and, under the same con-
<div n="lb">stellation, meat of goat, etc., and {%śrāddhas%} at {%Gayā (b),%} (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@88@}); the different merits acquired by persons by performing
<div n="lb">optional {%(kāmyāni) śrāddhas%} under various {%nakṣatras,%} and
<div n="lb">which were [first] explained by {%Yama%} to {%Śaśabindu:%} by per-
<div n="lb">forming such a {%śrāddha%} under the {%Kṛttikās,%} “a man acquires
<div n="lb">the merit of a sacrifice after establishing the sacred fire, and
<div n="lb">ascends to heaven with his children” (PCR.), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Having
<div n="lb">listened to these ordinances about the {%śrāddha, Śaśabindu%}
<div n="lb">acted accordingly, and easily subjugated and ruled the earth
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@89@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained
<div n="lb">to what kinds of brahmans the offerings made at {%śrāddhas%}
<div n="lb">should be given away, quoting the {%Vaikhānasa Ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@90@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by whom the {%śrāddha%}
<div n="lb">was first conceived, etc., in the time when the world was
<div n="lb">only peopled by the descendants of {%Bhṛgu%} and {%Aṅgiras%}
<div n="lb">{%(Bhṛgv-Aṅgirasake kāle),%} etc., {%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Brahmán >%}
<div n="lb">{%Atri > Dattātreya > Nimi > Śrīmat.%} After 1,000 years
<div n="lb">{%Śrīmat%} died, having undergone the severest austerities;
<div n="lb">{%Nimi,%} filled with grief, collected various agreeable objects
<div n="lb">on the 14th day of the moon, and the next morning he con-
<div n="lb">ceived the idea of a {%śrāddha;%} on the day of the new moon
<div n="lb">he invited a number of respected brahmans, gave food to
<div n="lb">seven such brahmans, and made an offering of cakes of rice
<div n="lb">to his dead son, uttering his name and family {%(nāma-gotraṃ).%}
<div n="lb">He then became filled with regret, having done an act that was
<div n="lb">not laid down in the scriptures [that a father had done with
<div n="lb">reference to his son what sons ought to do with reference to
<div n="lb">their fathers, PCR.]; he thought of {%Atri,%} who came and
<div n="lb">comforted him, saying that this sacrifice in honour of the
<div n="lb">{%Pitṛs%} had been laid down and its rites regulated by {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">himself in days of yore: one should pour out libations to
<div n="lb">{%Agni,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the gods named {%Pitṛs%} [and] {%Uṣṇapas%} [so
[Page049-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">B. and C.; cf. BR., v. {%Ūṣmapa%}] were created by {%Svayambhū%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Brahmán) and consist of seven classes {%(saptakaḥ pitṛ-%}
<div n="lb">{%vaṃśas tu):%} when they are honoured by a {%śrāddha,%} they become
<div n="lb">freed from sin; the {%Viśvedevas%} [sixty-four (<lang n="greek"></lang>) are enumerated],
<div n="lb">having {%Agni%} for their mouth, they are eternal (? {%Kālasya gati-%}
<div n="lb">{%gocarāḥ;%} C. {%°syāga°;%} “eternal and conversant with all that
<div n="lb">occurs in time,” PCR.). Articles that should not be offered
<div n="lb">at {%śrāddhas.%} From the place of a {%śrāddha%} a {%Cāṇḍāla%} and
<div n="lb">a {%Śvapaca%} should be excluded, as also one who wears yellow
<div n="lb">clothes {%(Kāṣāyavāsāḥ),%} a leper, an outcast {%(patitaḥ),%} etc.
<div n="lb">Having said this to Ṛ. {%Nimi, Atri%} went back to the celestial
<div n="lb">palace of {%Pitāmaha%} (Brahmán) (XIII, {@91@}). After {%Nimi%} had
<div n="lb">acted in this way, M.-ṛ. performed a {%śrāddha.%} The {%Pitṛs%} and
<div n="lb">gods became afflicted with indigestion in consequence of the
<div n="lb">offerings {%(nivāpa)%} made by persons of the four castes. They
<div n="lb">repaired to {%Soma,%} and thence to {%Svayambhū%} (on the summit
<div n="lb">of {%Meru%}), and thence to {%Agni. Agni%} told them to eat those
<div n="lb">offerings together with him. It is for this reason that in
<div n="lb">making offerings at {%śrāddhas%} a share is first offered to {%Agni;%}
<div n="lb">then also the {%Brahma-Rākṣasas%} cannot do any injury to the
<div n="lb">{%śrāddha;%} but the {%Rakṣases%} fly away from it (v. 4383—4).
<div n="lb">The cake should first be offered to the [deceased] father,
<div n="lb">then to the grandfather, then to the great-grandfather; at
<div n="lb">each cake the {%Sāvitrī%} should be uttered {%(Somāyeti ca vaktavyaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%tathā pitṛmateti ca);%} a woman of another {%gotra (anyavaṃśajā),%}
<div n="lb">etc., should not assist at a {%śrāddha;%} while crossing a river,
<div n="lb">one should offer oblations of water to one's P., and also on
<div n="lb">the day of the new moon {%(māsardhhe kṛṣṇapakṣasya);%} this
<div n="lb">gives prosperity, etc.; {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), are great masters
<div n="lb">of {%yoga%} and [numbered among] P. (XIII, {@92@}).—§ 750:
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} said that brahmans who are
<div n="lb">observant of vows not mentioned in the {%Vedas%} may eat at
<div n="lb">{%śrāddhas%} without incurring sin; but not so those who are
<div n="lb">observant of vows mentioned in the {%Vedas.%} Penance is not
<div n="lb">really identifiable with fast; one should not torment one's
<div n="lb">own body; renunciation is the best of penances; the brahman
<div n="lb">should eat {%Vighasa%} or {%Aṃṛta%} (i.e. food that remains after the
<div n="lb">guests, etc., have eaten); one should only eat morning and
<div n="lb">evening at the prescribed hours, etc.; such men obtain
<div n="lb">felicity in the abode of {%Brahmán%} in the company of Aps. and
<div n="lb">G. If the giver happens to be unrighteous, the receiver
<div n="lb">sinks into hell. In this connection an old tale of a con-
<div n="lb">versation between {%Vṛṣādarbhi%} and the seven {%Ṛṣis%} is told:
<div n="lb">Bisastainyopākhyāna {%(b)%} (XIII, {@93@}).—§ 751: {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">said: In this connection the old story of the oaths on the
<div n="lb">occasion of a {%tīrthayātrā%} [i.e. Śapathavidhi] is told {%(b)%}
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@94@}).—§ 752: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by whom the
<div n="lb">custom of giving umbrellas and sandals at {%śrāddhas%} was
<div n="lb">introduced, {%Bhīṣma%} related the story of the discourse between
<div n="lb">{%Jamadagni%} and {%Sūrya%} [i.e. Chattropānahotpatti] {%(b).%}
<div n="lb">“Do thou, therefore, give away umbrellas and shoes to
<div n="lb">brahmans. He who gives away a white umbrella with 100
<div n="lb">ribs to a brahman attains to eternal felicity after death in
<div n="lb">{%Śakra-loka,%} being respected by brahmans, Aps., and D.” (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@95—96@}).—§ 753: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the duties
<div n="lb">of a householder, {%Bhīṣma%} recited the old story of {%Vāsudeva%}
<div n="lb">(Kṛṣṇa) and the goddess {%Pṛthivī%} (Earth), who instructed
<div n="lb">{%Vāsudeva%} on this very topic: Ṛ., D., P., and men should be
<div n="lb">worshipped…; he should perform an {%Agnī-Ṣoma,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśvadeva,%} and {%Dhānvantarya%} offering, and separately an
<div n="lb">offering to {%Prajānāṃ pati;%} and {%bali%} to {%Yama,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he
<div n="lb">should daily perform a {%śrāddha%} (description); he should take
<div n="lb">his food last of all {%(śiṣṭāśī);%} he should with {%madhuparka%}
[Page049-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">honour a king, {%ṛtvij, guru,%} father-in-law, and {%snātaka;%} in the
<div n="lb">evening and morning he should place food on the ground for
<div n="lb">dogs, {%śvapacas,%} and birds: this is called the {%Vaiśvadeva%} offering.
<div n="lb">{%Vāsudeva%} acted accordingly (XIII, {@97@}).—§ 754: Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma,%} in order to explain the gift of lamps,
<div n="lb">flowers, and incense, told the old story of the discourse
<div n="lb">between the Prajāpati {%Manu Svāyambhuva%} and the learned and
<div n="lb">noble brahman {%Suvarṇa%} (so called from his golden complexion)
<div n="lb">on the golden mountain {%Meru.%} Asked by {%Suvarṇa%} about the
<div n="lb">above-named topic, {%Manu%} related the old history of the
<div n="lb">discourse between {%Śukra Bhārgava%} and the {%Asura%} king {%Bali%}
<div n="lb">{%Vairocana,%} who ruled the three worlds. Asked by {%Bali%} about
<div n="lb">this very topic, {%Śukra%} discoursed on the plants (having {%Soma%}
<div n="lb">for their lord), of which some are {%amṛta%} (and agreeable to the
<div n="lb">gods, etc.) and some poison; some are acceptable to As., some
<div n="lb">to the gods, Rā., U., Y., men, P.; garlands of water flowers
<div n="lb">should be offered to G., N., and Y.; plants with red flowers
<div n="lb">and keen scent and having thorns have been laid down in the
<div n="lb">{%Atharvans%} as fit for incantation in order to injure foes, etc.;
<div n="lb">D. become gratified with the scent of flowers, Y. and Rā.
<div n="lb">with their sight, N. with their touch, men with all three.
<div n="lb">Among incenses, all exudations (except that of the {%Boswellia%}
<div n="lb">{%serrata%}) are agreeable to the gods; that of {%Aquilaria Agallocha%}
<div n="lb">to Y., Rā., and N.; that of {%Boswellia serrata,%} etc., to Dai.,
<div n="lb">etc. [For avoiding] {%Andhatamas%} (B. {%°aṃ ta°;%} a certain hell,
<div n="lb">Nīl.), darkness, and the sun's southward course, one should
<div n="lb">give lights during the sun's northward course (Nīl. and the
<div n="lb">note of PCR., p. 477); D. are resplendent, Rā. dark; hence
<div n="lb">one should always give lights, etc.; thereby a man attains
<div n="lb">to the same world as the celestial lights {%(jyotiṣāṃ sālokyaṃ).%}
<div n="lb">The merits of {%bali%}-offerings made to D., Y., U., men, {%Bhūtas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Rā.%} Y., Rā., Pn., D., P., etc., are supported by the food
<div n="lb">offered by the householder; the {%bali%} offered to Y. and Rā.
<div n="lb">should be rich in blood and meat, wines and spirits, etc.; {%balis%}
<div n="lb">with lotuses and {%utpalas%} are agreeable to N.; sesame seeds
<div n="lb">with sugar to the {%Bhūtas.%} He who eats without first serving
<div n="lb">brahmans and gods and guests and children, should be known
<div n="lb">as a Rā. Thus said {%Kāvya Bhārgava%} to {%Bali;%} then {%Manu >%}
<div n="lb">{%Suvarṇa > Nārada > Bhīṣma%} (XIII, {@98@}).—§ 755: {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} (referring to § 754) once more questioned {%Bhīṣma%} on
<div n="lb">this subject; {%Bhīṣma%} told the old story of the discourse
<div n="lb">between {%Nahuṣa%} and {%Agastya%} and {%Bhṛgu%} [i.e. Nahuṣopā-
<div n="lb">khyāna] {%(b)%} (XIII, {@99—100@}).—§ 756: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">where those men go who steal articles belonging to brahmans,
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the old conversation between a {%Cāṇḍāla%} and
<div n="lb">a {%Kṣattriya (Kṣattrabandhoḥ),%} who wondered that the old
<div n="lb">{%Cāṇḍāla,%} whose body was besmeared with the dust raised by
<div n="lb">dogs and asses, without minding that dust, was anxious to
<div n="lb">wash off the small drops of milk that had fallen upon his
<div n="lb">body; the {%Cāṇḍāla%} related that formerly some kine belonging
<div n="lb">to a brahman were stolen, and some milk from them fell upon
<div n="lb">some {%Soma%} plants that grew by the roadside; the king who
<div n="lb">performed the sacrifice with this {%Soma,%} the brahmans who
<div n="lb">drank its juice, those who had assisted at the sacrifice, and
<div n="lb">those who drank milk, etc., in the palace of this king, had to
<div n="lb">fall into hell, as also the sons and grandsons of those who had
<div n="lb">stolen them, and the queen, although she treated the animals
<div n="lb">with great care. The {%Cāṇḍāla%} himself, who had lived in the
<div n="lb">observance of {%brahmacarya%} in that place, and whose alms
<div n="lb">had been sprinkled with the milk of the kine, had in this
<div n="lb">life become a {%Cāṇḍāla.%} It is for this reason that the {%Soma%}
<div n="lb">plants become unsaleable, and the persons who sell and
<div n="lb">who purchase them both sink into the {%Raurava-%}hell, when
[Page050-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">they repair to the region of {%Yama,%} etc. “Behold also this
<div n="lb">miserable dog!” In a former life the {%Cāṇḍāla%} was born
<div n="lb">in a noble family, but out of pride he ate the meat
<div n="lb">attached to the vertebral column of animals, and thence
<div n="lb">he had attained to his present state; in consequence of some
<div n="lb">meritorious act in a former life, he had retained the memory
<div n="lb">of his previous existences. Asked by the {%Cāṇḍāla,%} the
<div n="lb">{%kṣattriya%} told him (in order to obtain emancipation {%(mokṣa)%}
<div n="lb">from his state of a {%Cāṇḍāla%}) to give up his life for the sake
<div n="lb">of a brahman. This the {%Cāṇḍāla%} did in a battle for protecting
<div n="lb">a brahman's wealth, and attained to a desirable end (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@101@}).—§ 757: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} whether there is
<div n="lb">a difference of position among righteous men after death,
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the conversation
<div n="lb">between the muni {%Gautama%} and {%Indra%} [i.e. Hastikūṭa] {%(b)%}
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@102@}).—(†) § 758: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what
<div n="lb">constitutes the highest penance, {%Bhīṣma%} said that there is no
<div n="lb">penance superior to abstention from food, and told the old
<div n="lb">story of the conversation between king {%Bhagīratha%} and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán. Bhagīratha%} had transcended the world of the
<div n="lb">gods, that of kine, and that of the {%Ṛṣis;%} beholding this,
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} asked him how he had attained to that region,
<div n="lb">where neither gods, nor G., nor men succeed in coming
<div n="lb">without having practised the severest austerities; {%Bhagīratha%}

<div n="lb">what regulates rebirth, etc. {%Bhīṣma%} directed him to ask
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati,%} as none else was capable of explaining the matter.
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: While they were thus speaking {%Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">came from heaven; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">honoured him; then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked him, what is

<div n="lb">to the next world. {%Bṛhaspati%} said: Righteousness.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked, how righteousness can accompany the

<div n="lb">witnesses, etc. Deities dwelling in the body, viz. earth, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>). After birth {%Jīva%} receives woe and death from the

<div n="lb">to go to the dominions of {%Yama,%} and after suffering great misery

<div n="lb">{%(śāstre)%} with the histories {%(setihāse).%} In the regions of {%Yama%}
<div n="lb">there are places worthy of being the abodes even of the deities,

<div n="lb">worse than [those of animals]. Different forms in which
<div n="lb">{%Jīva%} has to take birth in consequence of different acts (e.g.
<div n="lb">as a {%Brahma-Rākṣasa;%} as {%Mlecchas%}). [The periods that

<div n="lb">very short, some few months or years.] “I heard all this
<div n="lb">in days of old from {%Brahmán%} himself in the midst of the
[Page051-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%surarṣis%}” (XIII, {@111@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">explained by what acts people, having committed sin,
<div n="lb">attain to an auspicious end in this world and in heaven,

<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bṛhaspati%} discoursed on the six doors of
<div n="lb">righteousness (abstention from injury, the observance of the

<div n="lb">and obedience to preceptors), saying that the man who
<div n="lb">practises the religion of universal compassion achieves the
<div n="lb">highest good, etc. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Then {%Bṛhaspati%}
<div n="lb">ascended to heaven. [XIII, {@111—113@} are called {%Saṃsāra-%}
<div n="lb">{%cakra%}] (XIII, {@113@}).—§ 761: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: After
<div n="lb">this {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} addressing {%Bhīṣma%} (lying on his bed of
<div n="lb">arrows), said: R., D., and brahmans, led by the authority
<div n="lb">of the {%Vedas,%} praise the religion of compassion; but how
<div n="lb">does a man who has injured others in word, thought, and
<div n="lb">deed, succeed in freeing himself from misery? {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">recommended abstention from meat; meat, moreover, enslaves
<div n="lb">the mind by taste (XIII, {@114@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (referring to
<div n="lb">§ 749) wondered how, when abstention from injury is the
<div n="lb">highest religion, persons should make offerings of meat
<div n="lb">in {%śrāddhas%} in honour of P. {%Bhīṣma%} referred to the
<div n="lb">innumerable discourses on this topic that had taken place
<div n="lb">between Ṛ., and strongly recommended abstention from
<div n="lb">honey and meat, referring to the seven Ṛ. {%(Saptarṣayaḥ),%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and quoting {%Manu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he who eats flesh of
<div n="lb">animals slain by others incurs the sin that attaches to the
<div n="lb">slaughter; he who purchases flesh slays living creatures
<div n="lb">through his wealth (the eater's demerit is, however, not so
<div n="lb">great as the slayer's); by eating flesh left from sacrifices
<div n="lb">[to D. and P.; v. especially {%Agastya%}] and of animals
<div n="lb">that have been slain for feeding brahmans, one incurs
<div n="lb">a small fault. In old time persons who wanted to attain
<div n="lb">to regions of merit hereafter, performed sacrifices with
<div n="lb">seeds. Especially in the month of {%Kārttika%} or in its bright
<div n="lb">fortnight one should abstain from [honey and] meat, which
<div n="lb">many ancient kings have done: {%Nābhāga,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">those who abstain from flesh for months or fortnights
<div n="lb">continuously, have {%Brahmaloka%} reserved to them. (It is
<div n="lb">by truthfulness that {%Hariścandra%} roves through heaven like
<div n="lb">a second {%Candramas.%}) Also the kings {%Śyenacitra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), did
<div n="lb">not eat flesh during the month of {%Kārttika,%} and, therefore,
<div n="lb">attained to {%Brahmaloka,%} adored by G. and surrounded by
<div n="lb">1,000 beautiful damsels. The eaters of meat go to Hell;
<div n="lb">he who practises the religion of abstention from meat or
<div n="lb">teaches it to others will never have to go to Hell, even if
<div n="lb">he be exceedingly wicked in other respects* (XIII, {@115@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what can be eaten, etc., {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">discoursed on what is flesh, and continued the preceding
<div n="lb">discourse, again mentioning {%Agastya;%} snakes, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), never
<div n="lb">hurt him who is devoted to compassion; those who are
<div n="lb">covetous of meat are cooked in the hell called {%Kumbhipāka;%}
<div n="lb">etymology of the word {%māṃsa%} (flesh) (XIII, {@116@}).—§ 762:
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what end those attain to who give
<div n="lb">up their lives in battle, though to give up life is difficult for
<div n="lb">men, whether they are in prosperity or adversity, {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">explained the old narrative of the conversation, in former
<div n="lb">times, between {%Vyāsa%} and a worm: Kīṭopākhyāna {%(b)%}
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@117—119@}).—§ 763: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the
<div n="lb">relative superiority of knowledge, penances, and gifts, {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">told the old narrative of the conversation between {%Maitreya%}
<div n="lb">and {%Vyāsa:%} Maitreya-bhikṣā {%(b)%} (XIII, {@120—122@}).—
[Page052-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">§ 764: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the behaviour of good
<div n="lb">and chaste women, {%Bhīṣma%} said: Once {%Sumanā Kaikeyī%} in
<div n="lb">{%Devaloka%} asked the omniscient {%Śāṇḍilī%} by what course of acts
<div n="lb">she had attained to heaven (description). {%Śāṇḍilī%} said that
<div n="lb">it was not by wearing yellow robes or barks of trees, or by
<div n="lb">shaving her head, or by means of matted hair, that she had
<div n="lb">attained to this state, but by never saying any disagreeable
<div n="lb">word to her husband; by always worshipping D., P., and
<div n="lb">brahmans; by always obeying her mother-in-law and father-
<div n="lb">in-law, etc. (enumeration). By adhering to this path of duty
<div n="lb">a woman is honoured in heaven like a second {%Arundhatī.%}
<div n="lb">Then {%Śāṇḍilī%} disappeared* (XIII, {@123@}).—§ 765: Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} which is of superior efficacy, gentleness or gifts,
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said that some become gratified by gentleness, others
<div n="lb">by gifts, and related the ancient narrative of how a brahman,
<div n="lb">who had been seized in a forest by a Rā., was released [on
<div n="lb">account of his gentleness], after answering the question put to
<div n="lb">him by the Rā., “Why am I pale of hue and so lean?” [a long
<div n="lb">and very curious enumeration of causes that may render a
<div n="lb">man pale and lean]. Rā. worshipped that brahman, and
<div n="lb">making him his friend and bestowing wealth upon him, let
<div n="lb">him off (XIII, {@124@}).—§ 766: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked about the
<div n="lb">following “mysteries”: how a poor man, desirous of
<div n="lb">achieving his own good, should act; what is the best of all
<div n="lb">gifts, and what should be given under various circumstances;
<div n="lb">and who are truly deserving of honour and worship.
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Thus questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} explained those high mysteries. {%Bhīṣma%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} explained them to me in days of yore; it is
<div n="lb">a mystery to the very gods; {%Yama,%} by vows and {%yoga,%} had
<div n="lb">acquired the knowledge thereof as the fruit of his penances;
<div n="lb">what pleases each god, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The scale of sinfulness in
<div n="lb">the giver is this: 1 [territorial] chief = 10 courtezans;
<div n="lb">1 courtezan = 10 drinkers of alcohol; 1 drinker = 10 oilmen;
<div n="lb">1 oilman = 10 butchers; a king is reckoned to be half more
<div n="lb">[sinful as a giver] than these all; hence, one should not
<div n="lb">accept gifts from such. In the {%śrāddha%} ritual the mysteries
<div n="lb">of D., P., and R. have been declared. Once a celestial
<div n="lb">messenger, sent by the {%Aśvins,%} came to the court of {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">(where men, P., and D. assembled together), and, remaining
<div n="lb">invisible, asked {%Indra%} why sexual intercourse is interdicted
<div n="lb">to the man who performs a {%śrāddha%} and to him who eats
<div n="lb">a {%śrāddha,%} and to whom each of the three rice-balls offered
<div n="lb">separately at a {%śrāddha%} should be sacrificed. D. (seated
<div n="lb">towards the east) and P. applauded him. P. said: Lest
<div n="lb">the P. of that man should have to lie for a whole month
<div n="lb">on his vital seed; the first rice-ball > the water > the
<div n="lb">moon > the other gods and P.; the second should be eaten
<div n="lb">by the spouse; P. confer a son on him who is desirous of
<div n="lb">a son; the third is thrown into the fire; P. grant all wishes.
<div n="lb">The {%ṛtvij%} at a {%śrāddha%} becomes the P. of the {%yajamāna,%}
<div n="lb">and, therefore, should abstain for that day from sexual
<div n="lb">intercourse. Ṛ. {%Vidyutprabha%} asked what the atonement
<div n="lb">is for slaying worms, ants, snakes, sheep, deer, birds, etc.
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} answered: “Thinking of {%Kurukṣetra,%} etc.” (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(specification); {%Vidyutprabha%} recommended another rite
<div n="lb">(specification), and a “mystery” discovered by Ṛ., which
<div n="lb">he had heard from {%Bṛhaspati%} in the presence of {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">(standing on one foot on a mountain, etc.). Asked by {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} discoursed on the wicked persons who make water
<div n="lb">facing the sun [Sūrya], etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The D., M., and Ṛ., as to
<div n="lb">what gifts at a {%śrāddha%} become inexhaustible. P. said: By
<div n="lb">setting free dark-coloured bulls, by gifts of sesame seeds and
[Page052-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">water on the day of new moon, and of lamps in the season of
<div n="lb">rains, men free themselves from the debt to P. Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Vṛddhagārgya,%} P. said: If a blue bull [upon being set free]
<div n="lb">raises water with its tail, P. become gratified by that [water]
<div n="lb">for 60,000 years; if the mud from a river bank is attached to
<div n="lb">its horns, P. go to {%Somaloka;%} by giving lamps in the season
<div n="lb">of rain, one shines like the moon; those who on the day
<div n="lb">of new moon make gifts of sesame seeds and water, mixed
<div n="lb">with honey, using a vessel of {%uḍumbara%} ({%Ficus glomerata,%}
<div n="lb">PCR. copper), have duly performed a {%śrāddha%} with its
<div n="lb">mysteries, and get cheerful and healthy children (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@125@}). Asked by {%Indra%} how he becomes gratified, {%Viṣṇu%}
<div n="lb">said that he hates the destruction of brahmans; that he is
<div n="lb">gratified by the worship of brahmans, with those who
<div n="lb">worship and make offerings in the circle besmeared with
<div n="lb">cow-dung (because it was with his circular disc that the Dai.
<div n="lb">were slain), those who reverence their own feet (because it
<div n="lb">was with his two feet that the world was covered); those
<div n="lb">who behold a boar that has just emerged from water and on
<div n="lb">his head carries a quantity of mud from the bank (reminding
<div n="lb">of the form of a boar in which {%Viṣṇu%} slew {%Hiraṇyākṣa%}), or
<div n="lb">a brahman that is a dwarf in stature ({%Viṣṇu%} having conquered
<div n="lb">king {%Bali%} as a dwarf), have never to meet with any evil (the
<div n="lb">explanations were given as answer to {%Indra%}). The man who
<div n="lb">every day worships the {%aśvattha (Ficus religiosa)%} and {%gorocana%}
<div n="lb">and the cow is considered to worship the whole universe
<div n="lb">with D., As., and men; “staying within such, I, in my own
<div n="lb">form, accept the worship that is offered to them; the worship
<div n="lb">of other kind I never accept.” {%Baladeva%} points out the
<div n="lb">importance of touching a cow, ghee, etc., at early dawn. The
<div n="lb">gods point to the importance of using an {%uḍumbara%} vessel in
<div n="lb">presenting offerings to D. and P. {%Dharma%} said that the
<div n="lb">offerings in honour of D. and P. should never be given to
<div n="lb">a brahman who has accepted service under the king, or who
<div n="lb">rings the bell, etc.; from the house of a person from whom
<div n="lb">a guest returns unsatisfied, P., D., and the sacred fires all
<div n="lb">return disappointed. {%Agni%} declared that P. of one who raises
<div n="lb">his foot to kick a cow or a brahman or a fire become filled
<div n="lb">with fear; that D. become highly dissatisfied, and that he
<div n="lb">himself has to be roasted in hell {%(narake pacyate)%} for 100
<div n="lb">ages; fire refuses to accept his libations. {%Viśvāmitra%} said:
<div n="lb">He who offers rice boiled in sugared milk to P., facing
<div n="lb">the south, at noon, in the first “elephant shade” ({%gajacchā-%}
<div n="lb">{%yāyāṃ pūrvasyāṃ,%} v. BR.), when in the month of {%Bhādrapada%}
<div n="lb">[the conjunction of the moon with] {%Maghā%} takes place in the
<div n="lb">dark fortnight, has [thereby] performed a great {%śrāddha%}
<div n="lb">[every year] for thirteen years [in succession]. The cows
<div n="lb">said: († v. 6042—5) that man becomes-free from his sins
<div n="lb">who adores a cow, saying: “…in {%Brahmapura%} (the
<div n="lb">city of Brahmán), in days of yore, thou wast present with
<div n="lb">thy calf at the sacrifice of {%Indra;%} thou who stoodst in
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇupada%} and in the path of {%Agni (? Vibhāvasoḥ),%} all the
<div n="lb">gods with {%Nārada%} call thee {%Sarvasahā%}”; he attains to the
<div n="lb">regions {%(lokān)%} of {%Indra,%} etc. Then the seven Ṛ. circum-
<div n="lb">ambulated {%Brahmán,%} and {%Vasiṣṭha%} asked how poor righteous
<div n="lb">men may acquire the merits attaching to sacrifices. {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">answered: If one, in the bright fortnight of the month of
<div n="lb">{%Pauṣa,%} when {%Rohiṇī%} is in conjunction, purifying himself by
<div n="lb">a bath, lies under the cope of heaven, clad in a single
<div n="lb">garment, with faith and concentrated attention, and drinks
<div n="lb">the rays of the moon, one acquires the merits of great
<div n="lb">sacrifices. This is a high mystery (XIII, {@126@}). {%Vibhāvasu%}
<div n="lb">recommended to offer a handful of water and {%akṣatāḥ%} (rice-
[Page053-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">grain) with ghee to the moon on the day of the full moon,
<div n="lb">and warns against cutting a tree or chewing a tooth-brush on
<div n="lb">the day of the new moon, lest the {%Moon,%} P., and D. should be
<div n="lb">offended. {%Śrī%} said that D. and P. fly away from that house
<div n="lb">in which vessels, etc., lie scattered, and in which women are
<div n="lb">beaten. {%Aṅgiras%} said that the offspring of that man increases
<div n="lb">who every night for a full year stands under a {%karañjaka%} tree
<div n="lb">with a lamp and the roots of the {%Suvarcala%} plant. {%Gārgya%}
<div n="lb">recommended, for example, that one should always repeat
<div n="lb">the names of the {%Puṣkara%} lakes; while the merit of even
<div n="lb">100 sacrifices is exhausted, the merit resulting from the
<div n="lb">performance of the duties that he has mentioned becomes
<div n="lb">inexhaustible; a woman during her season or one whose
<div n="lb">mother is a leper must not assist at sacred rites, or D.
<div n="lb">will not eat the libations and P. not become gratified for
<div n="lb">thirteen years; at a {%śrāddha%} one should also recite the
<div n="lb">{%Bhārata. Dhaumya%} warned against broken utensils (which
<div n="lb">mean {%Kali%} himself), broken bedsteads (which mean loss of
<div n="lb">wealth), and trees in the house (under whose roots snakes
<div n="lb">and scorpions find shelter); when a cock or a dog is in sight,
<div n="lb">the gods do not eat the offerings made to them. {%Jamadagni%}
<div n="lb">said that a man whose heart is not pure is sure to go to hell,
<div n="lb">even if he performs a horse-sacrifice or 100 {%Vājapeyas;%} by
<div n="lb">giving only a {%prastha%} of powdered barley with a pure heart
<div n="lb">to a brahman, a very poor brahman attained to {%Brahmaloka%}
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@127@}). {%Vāyu%} said that he who, during the four months
<div n="lb">of the rainy season, offers sesames and water, etc., acquires all
<div n="lb">the merit resulting from 100 sacrifices in which animals are
<div n="lb">offered up to the gods. When a {%Śūdra%} ignites the sacred
<div n="lb">fires, or women are allowed to assist at rites, one is reborn as
<div n="lb">a {%Śūdra,%} and P. and D. are never gratified with him; as an
<div n="lb">expiation, one should for three days pour into the sacred fire
<div n="lb">libations of the urine of the cow mixed with cow-dung, milk,
<div n="lb">and ghee; after a year the gods once more accept the offerings
<div n="lb">of such a man, and P. become gratified (XIII, {@128@}). {%Lomaśa%}
<div n="lb">warned against cohabiting with the wives of other people or
<div n="lb">a barren woman, and against appropriating what belongs
<div n="lb">to a brahman, or D. and P. will refuse one's offerings, etc.
<div n="lb">On the 12th lunar day and the day of full moon, one
<div n="lb">should every month make gifts of ghee and {%akṣata%} to
<div n="lb">brahmans; thereby {%Soma%} and the Ocean increases, and {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">confers one-fourth of the merit of a horse-sacrifice, and {%Soma%}
<div n="lb">grants the fruition of one's wishes. He who, during this
<div n="lb">{%Kaliyuga,%} at dawn, in white robes, makes gifts of a vessel
<div n="lb">of sesame seeds to brahmans, and of water with sesame seeds
<div n="lb">and honey to P., and who gives lamps and {%kṛśara,%} acquires,
<div n="lb">according to the ordinance of {%Indra,%} the merit of giving cows
<div n="lb">and land (which merit is eternal) and of an {%Agniṣṭoma.%}
<div n="lb">This is the ancient ordinance of Ṛ., applauded by P. and D.
<div n="lb">in heaven and {%Pitṛloka%} (XIII, {@129@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said: Ṛ., P.,
<div n="lb">and D. then asked {%Arundhatī%} (equal to [her husband]
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha;%} not in C.) about the mysteries of {%dharma%} [not
<div n="lb">in C.]. {%Arundhatī%} said that {%dharma%} should never be
<div n="lb">communicated to him who is bereft of faith, full of pride,
<div n="lb">guilty of having slain a brahman, or who violates the bed of
<div n="lb">his preceptor. She recommended hospitality as better than
<div n="lb">giving hundreds of thousands of cows in {%Puṣkara,%} etc.;
<div n="lb">he who at dawn sprinkles a cow's horns with {%kuśa-%}grass,
<div n="lb">and causes the water to drip down upon his own head, acquires
<div n="lb">the merit of bathing in all the {%tīrthas%} of the three worlds
<div n="lb">(resorted to by Si. and Cā.). D. and P. applauded her.
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} granted her that her penances would continually
<div n="lb">increase. {%Yama%} related the sayings of {%Citragupta:%} On days
[Page053-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">of the full moon and the new moon one's acts are conveyed to
<div n="lb">the Sun; when a mortal goes into {%Pretaloka%} (the regions of
<div n="lb">the dead), {%Vibhāvasu%} (the Sun) bears witness to all his acts;
<div n="lb">especially in {%Jyeṣṭha-Puṣkara%} one should give a {%kapilā%} cow
<div n="lb">to a learned brahman, on {%Kaumudī%} [the day of full moon in
<div n="lb">the month of {%Kārttika%}]; such a man is considered to have given
<div n="lb">100 cows with a bull, a gift which is productive of eternal
<div n="lb">merit. They that are of little understanding become afflicted
<div n="lb">with hunger and thirst in the regions of the dead, burning in
<div n="lb">pain, and there is no escape for them (they who make gifts
<div n="lb">of water, on the other hand, drink of a large river full of
<div n="lb">excellent water), and have to enter into a thick darkness (but
<div n="lb">{%Soma, Sūrya,%} and {%Agni%} always give light to him who has
<div n="lb">given lamps in this world, and he blazes forth like a second
<div n="lb">{%Sūrya%}). One should also give a pair of sandals to a deserving
<div n="lb">brahman, and an umbrella (thereby comfortable shade is
<div n="lb">obtained in the next world). {%Sūrya's%} hair stood on end;
<div n="lb">applauding the sayings of {%Citragupta,%} he said to D. and P.
<div n="lb">that these five should always be avoided: the slayer of a
<div n="lb">brahman, the slayer of a cow, he who is addicted to sexual
<div n="lb">intercourse with other people's wives, he who is bereft of faith,
<div n="lb">and he who derives his living from the misbehaviour of his
<div n="lb">wife; such persons suffer {%(pacyante)%} in hell like worms eating
<div n="lb">pus and blood, and are avoided by P., D., {%Snātakas,%} etc. (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@130@}). Asked by D., P., and Ṛ., the {%Pramathas%} said that men
<div n="lb">who are rendered impure by sexual intercourse without having
<div n="lb">previously purified themselves {%(ucchiṣṭāḥ),%} men who insult their
<div n="lb">superiors, who eat different kinds of meat, and sleep at the foot
<div n="lb">of a tree, he who keeps flesh under his pillow while lying down
<div n="lb">to sleep, who places the head where his feet should be placed
<div n="lb">(in lying down or sleeping), and who throws phlegm, etc., into
<div n="lb">the water: “these men deserve to be slain and eaten up by
<div n="lb">us.” Means of protection against them are: {%Gorocanā,%} [the
<div n="lb">root of] {%vacā%} [so B.], ghee with {%akṣata,%} abstaining from meat,
<div n="lb">ever-burning fire, the skin or teeth of a wolf, a hill-tortoise,
<div n="lb">[the sacrificial] smoke, a cat, a tawny or black goat; those
<div n="lb">articles are destructive of Rā. (XIII, {@131@}). {%Brahmán%} caused
<div n="lb">D. together with {%Indra%} and P. to let the elephant {%Reṇuka%} in
<div n="lb">{%Rasātala%} go and question the {%Diggajas%} (the elephants who
<div n="lb">sustain the earth) about the mysteries of {%dharma.%} Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Reṇuka,%} the {%Diggajas%} recommended a {%śrāddha,%} with gifts of
<div n="lb">treacle and rice, on the 8th day of the dark fortnight of
<div n="lb">{%Kārttika,%} under the conjunction of the moon with {%Āśleṣā,%}
<div n="lb">uttering certain {%mantras%} (mentioning “{%Baladeva%} and other
<div n="lb">{%Nāgas,%}” and “{%Nārāyaṇa%} when he raised the submerged
<div n="lb">earth”), and making {%bali%} offerings of blue cloth and fragrant
<div n="lb">unguents upon an anthill strewn with {%gajendra%} flowers at sunset.
<div n="lb">Thereby those beings in the nether regions that bear the
<div n="lb">weight of the upper regions become pleased, and the {%Diggajas%}
<div n="lb">do not feel the weight of upholding the earth. By observing
<div n="lb">this rule for a whole year, and fasting, the four castes acquire
<div n="lb">great merit; it is equal to hospitality for 100 years to all the
<div n="lb">elephants in the three worlds. D., P., and Ṛ. applauded
<div n="lb">{%Reṇuka%} (XIII, {@132@}). {%Śiva%} recommended to give food to cows
<div n="lb">every day for a month, contenting oneself with one meal
<div n="lb">a day; he who gives food to cows even for a single day,
<div n="lb">receives one-fourth of the merit of all his meritorious acts;
<div n="lb">cows uphold the three worlds with D., As., and men; {%Śiva%} had
<div n="lb">praised them in the {%Kṛta%} age; at the solicitation of {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">a bull stands in his banner, and he always sports with
<div n="lb">cows; only believers should be instructed in these mysteries
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@133@}). {%Skanda%} recommended to smear one's body for
<div n="lb">three days with earth from the horns of a dark-coloured bull
[Page054-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">and then to perform one's ablutions; to offer cooked food
<div n="lb">with honey, in an {%uḍumbara%} vessel, as {%bali%} to the moon on the
<div n="lb">evening of the day of full-moon, which offer is accepted by
<div n="lb">Sā., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and where by {%Soma%} and the Ocean increase*
<div n="lb">(spoken by {%Viṣṇu%}). {%Bhīṣma%} said that these mysteries
<div n="lb">(respected by D. and promulgated by {%Vyāsa%}) are even
<div n="lb">superior to the whole earth († v. 6198), and should not be
<div n="lb">imparted to any unbeliever, etc. (XIII, {@134@}).—§ 767:
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} enumerated those persons from
<div n="lb">which a brahman, a {%kṣattriya,%} a {%vaiśya,%} and a {%śūdra%} may take
<div n="lb">his food, etc. (XIII, {@135@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">expounded the expiations which purify a brahman of the
<div n="lb">sin he incurs by accepting forbidden food (especially offered
<div n="lb">to D. and P.); without having performed his ablutions,
<div n="lb">a brahman should not say his evening prayers, etc.; for this
<div n="lb">reason the {%śrāddha%} has been ordained to be performed in
<div n="lb">the afternoon (XIII, {@136@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} which
<div n="lb">is better, charity {%(dāna)%} or devotion {%(tapas), Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">enumerated the pious princes who have attained to heaven
<div n="lb">{%(lokāḥ)%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “These and many other men (householders) have
<div n="lb">attained to heaven by charity and penances, and return again
<div n="lb">and again. As night approaches, I shall explain to thee in the
<div n="lb">morning whatever doubts may arise in thy mind” (XIII, {@137@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (who refers to XIII, {@137@}), {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">discoursed on the five kinds of gifts: from desire of merit,
<div n="lb">from desire of profit, from fear, from free choice, and from
<div n="lb">pity; {%Brahmán%} has said that one should always make gifts
<div n="lb">according to one's power (XIII, {@138@}).—§ 768: {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira,%} complaining of the distress of the time, asked {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">to discourse on religion and profit in the presence of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">and all the kings. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said that {%Bhīṣma%} recited
<div n="lb">the discourses on the puissance of {%Viṣṇu%} in days of yore (and
<div n="lb">the doubt of {%Rudra%} and his spouse). Once {%Kṛṣṇa%} observed
<div n="lb">a vow for twelve years in order to obtain a son; {%Nārada,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), came there with Si., etc. (description of their seats); fire
<div n="lb">issued from the mouth of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and consumed the summit
<div n="lb">of the mountain with all its living creatures, then it came
<div n="lb">back and touched his feet; he cast a benignant look upon the
<div n="lb">mountain, which once more became adorned and peopled as
<div n="lb">before. Asked by Ṛ., {%Kṛṣṇa%} explained that, in consequence
<div n="lb">of his penances, his soul became transformed into fire and
<div n="lb">repaired to {%Brahmán%} (who told it that half of the energy of
<div n="lb">{%Śiva%} would take birth as {%Kṛṣṇa's%} son), and then went back;
<div n="lb">“I now ask you to tell me something that is highly
<div n="lb">wonderful, which you have heard of or seen on earth or in
<div n="lb">heaven.” Ṛ. glorified {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and asked by them, {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">described the wonderful incident on {%Himavat,%} “which
<div n="lb">was witnessed by Ṛ. on their {%tīrthayātrā%}” (XIII, {@139@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: Then Ṛ. {%Nārada,%} the friend of {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">told the following story of the discourse between {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">and {%Umā:%} Umā-Maheśvara-saṃvāda {%(b)%} (XIII, {@140-@}
<div n="lb">{@148@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Kṛṣṇa%} paid honour to R., who
<div n="lb">praised {%Kṛṣṇa,%} approving of what {%Śiva%} had said of him, and
<div n="lb">saying that they had told him [about the discourse of {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">with {%Umā%}], only to please him, since he had asked them;
<div n="lb">but “there is nothing in the three worlds that is unknown
<div n="lb">to thee.” Ṛ. took leave of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} promising him that he
<div n="lb">would soon get an excellent son. {%Kṛṣṇa%} returned to
<div n="lb">{%Dvārakā. Rukmiṇī,%} after the tenth month, bore a son who
<div n="lb">is identified with {%Kāma,%} which exists in every creature and

<div n="lb">many Dai. and Dā. have been slain by {%Kṛṣṇa,%} witness {%Śiva's%}
<div n="lb">utterances {%(purāṇaṃ)%} on {%Himavat%} to Ṛ.; the greatness, etc.,
<div n="lb">of {%Arjuna%} can only come up to one-third of that of {%Kṛṣṇa-%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} consoled {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (it is Time = {%Kṛṣṇa%} who has
<div n="lb">slain the warriors), citing {%Vyāsa%} and {%Nārada. Nārada%} and
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} have told me that “{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna (triyugau)%}
<div n="lb">practised penances in {%Badarī%} for 10,000 years”; he mentioned
<div n="lb">his slaying of {%Kaṃsa;%} the destruction of the {%Kurus%} is due
<div n="lb">to {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} remained silent; the

<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} and worshipped {%Kṛṣṇa.%} When {%Bhīṣma%} had rested

<div n="lb">the man who makes a present of 100 cows with their horns
<div n="lb">covered with gold to a learned brahman, and he who causes
<div n="lb">the excellent {%Bhārata%} story to be always recited, these two
<div n="lb">acquire [equal] merit; the benefits obtained by praising
<div n="lb">{%Bhṛgu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XIII, {@151@}).—§ 771: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">what course of conduct towards the various classes of persons
<div n="lb">is regarded faultless, {%Bhīṣma%} eulogised the brahmans, who are
<div n="lb">attentive to P., D., and guests; who eat the first portions of
<div n="lb">{%havya%} and {%kavya;%} who by their very eating rescue the three
<div n="lb">worlds from great fear; whose wealth consists in all the
<div n="lb">{%śikṣās%} and the {%śruti;%} whose wrath yet burns in the {%Daṇḍaka%}
<div n="lb">wood, etc. (XIII, {@152@}).—§ 772: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">what is the reward attached to the worship of brahmans,
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} told the old narrative of a conversation between
<div n="lb">{%Pavana%} (the Wind) and {%Arjuna%} [Kārtavīrya]: Pavanārjuna-
<div n="lb">saṃvāda {%(b)%} (XIII, {@153—158@}).—§ 773: Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the prosperity resulting from the worship
<div n="lb">of the brahmans, {%Bhīṣma,%} saying that the time of his death
<div n="lb">is not distant, and that he has recited all the duties mentioned
<div n="lb">in the {%Purāṇas,%} referred him to {%Kṛṣṇa (b)%} (XIII, {@159@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what prosperity results from the
<div n="lb">worship of the brahmans, {%Kṛṣṇa%} related what he in former
<div n="lb">times in {%Dvāravatī%} had answered his son {%Pradyumna,%} who
<div n="lb">was greatly excited by [some] brahmans and put this same
<div n="lb">question to him; they have {%Soma%} for their king. He related
<div n="lb">the visit of {%Durvāsas (c)%} (XIII, {@160@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">about the knowledge he had acquired from {%Durvāsas, Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">said that he would recite that {%Śatarudrīya%} which he repeats
[Page055-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">every morning, and which was composed by {%Prajāpati%} at
<div n="lb">the end of his penances. Then he praised {%Śiva (d)%} (XIII,
<div n="lb">{@161—162@}).—§ 774: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: After {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">had said these words, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} once more asked {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">which of the two, perception {%(pratyakṣaṃ)%} or the scriptures
<div n="lb">{%(āgamaḥ),%} should be [regarded as] authoritative for arriving
<div n="lb">at a conclusion {%(kāraṇaṃ bhavet). Bhīṣma%} answered that
<div n="lb">to affirm that perception is the only authority (as some
<div n="lb">persons do) is foolish; that knowledge which is derived
<div n="lb">from reasoning can scarcely be said to be knowledge.—
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} as to [which of these four is most
<div n="lb">authoritative, viz.] perception {%(pratyakṣaṃ),%} inference
<div n="lb">({%lokataḥ siddhir,%} i.e. {%anumānaṃ,%} Nīl.), the teaching of the
<div n="lb">scriptures {%(lokaś cāgamapūrvakaḥ),%} and the various kinds of
<div n="lb">good men's practice {%(śiṣṭācāro bahuvidhaḥ),%} he declared that as
<div n="lb">the might of unrighteous persons causes doubts to attach to
<div n="lb">perception, inference, and good conduct, good people who
<div n="lb">let themselves be led by the scriptures, and who are ever
<div n="lb">contented, should be resorted to for the solution of doubts.—
<div n="lb">As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} remarked that, the {%veda, pratyakṣa,%} and {%ācāra%}
<div n="lb">being all three {%pramāṇa%} (authority) [as to what is {%dharma,%}
<div n="lb">i.e. righteousness], the one {%dharma%} would become threefold,
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} answered that {%dharma%} is really one, though capable
<div n="lb">of being viewed from three different points; he should not
<div n="lb">engage in such [unfruitful] speculations, but simply follow
<div n="lb">his instructions like a blind man, knowing that righteousness
<div n="lb">consists in abstention from injury, truth, absence of wrath,
<div n="lb">and liberality, and that conduct towards the brahmans that
<div n="lb">has been observed by his sires and grandsires. The fool
<div n="lb">who would deny that to be authority that [has always been
<div n="lb">accepted as] authority, does not deserve to become an authority,
<div n="lb">for he creates [only] fright.—Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">said that those who hate righteousness have their hearts
<div n="lb">overwhelmed with passion and darkness and go to hell; those
<div n="lb">who observe righteousness go to heaven. The brahmans,
<div n="lb">who are the eldest sons of {%Brahmán,%} represent righteousness,
<div n="lb">and, therefore, they are worshipped by the righteous as a ripe
<div n="lb">fruit by a hungry man.—Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">indicated the acts that are characteristic of wicked and good
<div n="lb">men (curious enumeration): the good never talk while eating,
<div n="lb">and never go to sleep with wet hands; two times have been
<div n="lb">appointed by the deities for taking food, viz. morning and
<div n="lb">evening; in the meantime, one should not eat anything;
<div n="lb">when following this rule, one is said to observe a fast; one
<div n="lb">who never approaches his spouse at any other time save
<div n="lb">after her courses, is said to observe the vow of {%brahmacarya;%}
<div n="lb">{%amṛta,%} brahmans, and kine are regarded as equal; one does
<div n="lb">not incur any fault by eating the meat of animals slain in
<div n="lb">sacrifices with {%mantras%} from the {%Yajurveda;%} the flesh of the
<div n="lb">backbone, or that of animals not slain in sacrifices, is as the
<div n="lb">flesh of one's own son; one should eat in privacy; well-
<div n="lb">cooked frumenty, {%yāvaka%} (B. {%yavāgāṃ%}), {%kṛsara%} (C. {%°śa°%}), and
<div n="lb">{%havis%} [should be used in] the {%Aṣṭakās%} of gods and P. and
<div n="lb">[in] worshipping the planets; one should not shave without
<div n="lb">calling down a blessing upon oneself; if one sneezes, he
<div n="lb">should be blessed ({%“śataṃ jīva,”%} Nīl.) by those present;
<div n="lb">having committed a sin, one should confess it in the presence
<div n="lb">of those that are good; they would then destroy it; one
<div n="lb">should achieve righteousness in private, not make a show
<div n="lb">of righteousness; those are traders in righteousness who
<div n="lb">draw profit from it; one should lay up for oneself a treasure
<div n="lb">in the world to come, consisting in gifts made [here]
<div n="lb">to deserving persons (XIII, {@163@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} observed
[Page056-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">that the acquisition of wealth very often seems to be
<div n="lb">independent of exertion and learning, etc.; {%Bhīṣma%} said
<div n="lb">that when one, notwithstanding great exertion, fails to earn
<div n="lb">wealth, he should practise severe austerities, make gifts,
<div n="lb">abstain from cruelty, etc.; then happiness will be obtained
<div n="lb">[in the next life]; unless seeds be sown, no crops appear;
<div n="lb">even in the case of insects and ants, their acts [of this and
<div n="lb">past lives] and Nature are the cause of happiness and woe
<div n="lb">[i.e., the explanation of what seems unintelligible to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} is to be sought for in the actions in past lives]
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@164@}); to put faith in righteousness is the mark of
<div n="lb">wisdom; Time [which is the supreme disposer of all things]
<div n="lb">can never make righteousness the cause of misery, and
<div n="lb">unrighteousness is incapable of touching righteousness, which
<div n="lb">is protected by time; righteousness is fraught with victory
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@165@}).—§ 775: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Desirous of
<div n="lb">obtaining such goods as are destructive of sins, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">questioned {%Bhīṣma,%} who was lying on a bed of arrows.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said: What is beneficial for a person in
<div n="lb">this world? how can one be freed of all one's sins?
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: In this connection {%Bhīṣma%} recited the
<div n="lb">names of the gods to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Bhīṣma%} said: These
<div n="lb">names of the gods and Ṛ., if recited morning, noon, and
<div n="lb">evening, become purifiers of sins; then one has never to
<div n="lb">become blind or deaf, etc., and never takes birth as an animal
<div n="lb">or in the mixed castes, nor goes to Hell; the names of the
<div n="lb">gods and Ṛ., etc., rivers, mountains, etc.; {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">the Aps. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); learned brahmans in the eastern region (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in
<div n="lb">the southern region (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the western region (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the
<div n="lb">north (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the principal kings (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (to be recited at sunset
<div n="lb">and sunrise) (XIII, {@166@}).—§ 776: {%Janamejaya%} said: When
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} was lying on a bed of arrows, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">were sitting around him, my great-grandfather {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">heard these expositions of mysteries, etc.; what else did
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} do? {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: When {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">became silent, all the kings became silent; then {%Vyāsa,%} saying
<div n="lb">that {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc., had now been restored to their own
<div n="lb">nature, asked {%Bhīṣma%} to give {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} leave to return
<div n="lb">to the city, which he did, giving {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} some final
<div n="lb">exhortations, and friendly asking him to return when the
<div n="lb">hour came for his death. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his
<div n="lb">relatives and followers set out for {%Hāstinapura,%} and entered
<div n="lb">the city with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī,%} Ṛ., the citizens, the
<div n="lb">inhabitants of the country, and his counsellors (XIII, {@167@}).
