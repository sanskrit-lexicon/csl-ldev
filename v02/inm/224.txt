[{@Agastyopākhyāna@}.]¦ § 382 (Tīrthay.): In the city of
{%Maṇimatī%} there lived formerly a {%Daiteya Ilvala%}, whose
younger brother was {%Vātāpi%} ({%Prāhrādi%}, v. 8645). {%Ilvala%},
inflamed with wrath against all brahmans, because a brahman
had refused to grant him a son equal to {%Indra%}, used to
transform {%Vātāpi%} into a ram and offer his flesh to brahmans
as food, and then to recall him to life (whomsoever {%Ilvala%}
summoned with his voice would come back even from the
abode of {%Yama%}), and {%Vātāpi%}, ripping the flanks of the
brahmans, would come out laughing. Thus they killed many
brahmans. Meanwhile {%Agastya%} saw his ancestors hanging in
a hole with the heads downwards, and was asked by them to
procure offspring to them. As he did not see any wife
worthy of himself, he selected the most beautiful parts from
various creatures and created an excellent woman, whom he
caused to be born as the daughter of the {%Vidarbha%} king, who
was then undergoing ascetic penances for obtaining offspring.
She was named {%Lopāmudrā%}, and was very beautiful. When she
attained to puberty no one dared to ask for her hand (III, {@96@}).
When {%Agastya%} asked the {%Vidarbha%} king to bestow her upon him,
the king and his queen became much afflicted, but at her own
request {%Lopāmudrā%} was bestowed upon {%Agastya%}, who im-
mediately asked her to discard her ornaments and dress herself
in rags and barks and deer-skins and partake of his vows, and
proceeding to {%Gaṅgādvāra%} they practised the severest penances.
When at last he summoned her for marital intercourse she
made it a condition that he should approach her on a bed like
to that which she had in the palace of her father, and that
[Page018-a+ 63]
both should be adorned with costly ornaments, and she told
him to procure these things without impairing his ascetic
merit (III, {@97@}). {%Agastya%} then went to King {%Śrutarvan%} and
asked him for wealth, but seeing that his expenditure was
equal to his income, he took nothing, but, together with
{%Śrutarvan%}, went to King {%Bradhnaśva%}, with the same result;
then all three went to King {%Trasadasyu Paurukutsa%} of the line
of {%Ikṣvāku%}, with the same result. At the suggestion of the
three kings they all four went to {%Ilvala%} (III, {@98@}). {%Ilvala%} went
out with his ministers to receive them on the confines of his
domain. He prepared the flesh of {%Vātāpi%} in order to entertain
them, at which the kings became sad, but {%Agastya%} ate it all,
and when {%Ilvala%} summoned {%Vātāpi%} there came only air out
of {%Agastya's%} stomach, {%Vātāpi%} having already been digested.
Then {%Ilvala%}, becoming sad, promised to give them wealth if
{%Agastya%} could tell him what he intended to give, and {%Agastya%}
rightly said that he intended to give each of the kings 10,000
cows and as many gold coins, and to {%Agastya%} twice as much,
and a car that would be found to be a golden one, with two
steeds ({%Virāva%} and {%Surāva%}). The car brought {%Agastya%} and the
kings to {%Agastya's%} hermitage within the twinkling of an eye.
Then the {%rājarṣis%} went away to their cities. When {%Agastya%}
proposed to {%Lopāmudrā%} to choose between 1000 sons, or 100
each equal to 10, or 10 each equal to 100, or 1 equal to 1000,
she chose the last alternative. After she had conceived he
retired into the forest. After seven years she gave birth to
{%Drḍhasyu%}, who came out as if repeating the {%Vedas%} with the
{%Upaniṣads%} and {%Aṅgas%}; and from carrying, while yet a child,
loads of sacrificial fuel to the hermitage of his father, he was
called {%Idhmavāha. Agastya%} was highly pleased, and his
ancestors obtained the {%lokas%} they desired.—§ 384: In the
<is>kṛta age</is> the {%Dānava%} tribes named {%Kālakeyas%} under {%Vṛtra%}
pursued the gods under {%Indra%}. The gods, on the suggestion
of Brahmán, with {%Nārāyaṇa%} at their head, proceeded to the
hermitage of the ṛṣi {%Dadhīca%} on the other bank of {%Sarasvatī%},
and having prevailed upon him to leave his body, they caused
{%Tvaṣṭṛ%} to construct of his bones the six-sided ({%ṣaḍaśri) vajra%}
which {%Tvaṣṭṛ%} handed to {%Indra%} that he might slay {%Vṛtra%}
with it (III, {@100@}). In the encounter that ensued between
the gods and the {%Kālakeyas%} the gods were defeated, until
{%Nārāyaṇa%}, the gods, and the {%brahmarṣis%} had transferred
their own vigour to {%Indra%}. He then hurled the {%vajra%}
against {%Vṛtra%} and slew him so that he fell headlong like the
{%Mandara%} mountain hurled of yore from {%Viṣṇu's%} hand; but
{%Indra%} fled in fear, desiring to take shelter in a lake, thinking
that the {%vajra%} had not been hurled from his hand and that
{%Vṛtra%} was still alive, while the gods defeated the {%Dānavas%},
who fled to the depths of the sea. Here they conspired for
the destruction of the three worlds, and resolved upon
destroying all who were possessed of ascetic virtues ({%tapas%}),
for so the universe would itself be destroyed, as it is supported
by asceticism (III, {@101@}). Remaining in the depths of the
sea by day, the {%Kāleyas%} during the night slew the {%munis%} in
the hermitages and sacred spots ({%puṇyeṣvāyataneṣu%}); in the
hermitage of {%Vasiṣṭha%}, 197 ascetics; in that of {%Cyavana%}, 100;
in that of {%Bharadvāja%}, 20, without being seen; every morning
people saw the dead bodies and mutilated limbs of the {%munis%}
and the disturbed {%agnihotras%} scattered on the ground. Men
fled for their lives into all directions or killed themselves from
fear. Some brave bowmen searched in vain for the evildoers.
The gods with {%Indra%} repaired to {%Nārāyaṇa (c%}) (III, {@102@}).
They did not know by whom the {%brahmans%} were being killed
during the night. {%Viṣṇu%} explained the whole affair to them,
[Page018-b+ 63]
and told them to apply to {%Agastya (Maitrāvaruṇi%}) that he
might dry up the sea, as no one else was capable of so doing.
They then went to the hermitage of {%Agastya%}, and mentioned
to him that he had delivered the gods from {%Nahuṣa%} and
caused {%Vindhya%} to cease to increase in height (in competition
with the Sun), the world having been covered with darkness
(III, {@103@}).—§ 385: {%Vindhya%} (q.v.).—§ 386: At the request
of the gods {%Agastya%}, accompanied by {%ṛṣis%}, gods, men, {%Uragas%}
(snakes), {%Gandharvas, Yakṣas%}, and {%Kimpuruṣas%}, approached
the ocean (III, {@104@}) and drank it up, to the amazement of
the gods, who called him {%Vidhātṛ%} and the creator of the
worlds, while the musical instruments of {%Gandharvas%} were
playing, and celestial blossoms were showered upon him.
The {%Kāleyas%}, who had previously been burnt by the {%tapas%} of
the {%munis%}, were now destroyed by the gods, except some few
who, rending asunder the goddess Earth, sought refuge in
{%Pātāla%}. The gods now asked {%Agastya%} to fill up the ocean
again, but he had already digested the water. The gods
with {%Viṣṇu%} came to {%Brahmán%} and spoke to him about
replenishing the sea (III, {@105@}). {%Brahmán%} dismissed them,
saying that only after a long course of time the ocean would
be brought to resume its wonted state by the agnates of king
{%Bhagīratha%}.
