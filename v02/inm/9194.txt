{@Sabhākriyāparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the building
of the palace,” the 20th of the minor parvans of the
Mhbhr. Cf. Sabhākriyā). § 261: {%Maya%} said he was a great
artist ({%mahākavi%}), the {%Viśvakarman%} of the {%Dānavas%}, and
asked {%Arjuna%} to tell him what he was to do for him,
because he had been rescued by him. {%Arjuna%} told him to
do something for {%Kṛṣṇa (lokanāthaḥ Prajāpatiḥ%}, v. 9),
who asked him to build a palace for {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Maya%}
was introduced to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and recited the history
of the Asura ({%pūrvadeva-caritaṃ%}), i.e. of Vṛṣaparvan
(so Nīl.). Then on an auspicious day, after the initiatory
rites, and having gratified thousands of {%brahmans%}, he
measured out a piece of land 10,000 {%kiṣkus%} square (II, {@1@}).
—§ 262: Kṛṣṇa departed for {%Dvārakā%} (v. {%Bhagavad-%}
{%yāna%}).—§ 263: To the north of {%Kailāsa%}, near {%Maināka%},
there is a huge mountain named {%Hiraṇyaśṛṅga%}, consisting of
jewels. Near this mountain is situated the lake {%Bindusaras%},
where King {%Bhagīratha%} had dwelt for many years, desiring
to behold the {%Gaṅgā%}. There the lord of all beings (i.e.
{%Prajāpati%}, Nīl) had performed 100 sacrifices, where, for
the sake of embellishment, though not according to rule
({%dṛṣtāntataḥ%}), the sacrificial stakes were made of gems and
[Page602-b+ 63]
the altars ({%caityāḥ%}) of gold. There the 1,000-eyed {%Śacīpati%}
had become perfect ({%siddhiṃ gataḥ%}) by sacrifice. There
{%Bhūtapati%} (= {%Mahādera%}, Nīl.) took up his abode after having
created all the worlds, and there he dwells, worshipped by
thousands of spirits ({%bhūtaiḥ%}). There {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%},
{%Brahmán, Yama%}, and {%Sthāṇu%} perform their sacrifices at the
expiration of 1,000 {%yugas%}. There {%Vāsudeva%} has performed
{%sattras%} for many years, and placed thousands and tens of
thousands of sacrificial stakes adorned with golden garlands
and altars of great splendour. There {%Maya%}, when the
{%Dānavas%} wished to perform a sacrifice on the bank of the
{%Bindusaras%}, had made utensils of gems from the house of
{%Vṛṣaparvan%}. That wealth, which was guarded by {%Yakṣas%}
and {%Rākṣasas%}, he brought away, and thereof constructed the
palace of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. A club with which {%Vṛṣaparvan%}
had slain all foes in battle, and which had been placed in
{%Bindusaras, Maya%} gave to {%Bhīmasena%}; the conch-shell
{%Devadatta%}, that came from {%Varuṇa%}, and was also there, he
gave to {%Arjuna%}; at its sound all creatures trembled in awe.
The palace surpassed the {%Sudharmā%} of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and the
palace of {%Brahmán%}, and covered an area of 10,000 {%kiṣkus%}
square. Eight thousand {%Rākṣasas%}, called {%Kiṅkaras%}, guarded
and supported the palace. In it was a tank, whose lotuses
were of dark-coloured gems, etc.; many kings mistook it for
solid ground, and fell into it. The palace was constructed in
seventeen months (II, {@3@}).—§ 264: Enumeration of {%ṛṣis%}
(<lang n="greek">α</lang>) and kings (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) from various countries, who were present
when {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, after having fed 10,000 brahmans. etc.,
entered the palace. Also {%Tamburu%}, the friend of {%Dhanañjaya%},
and the {%Gandharva Citrasena%} with his ministers, and many
other {%Gandharvas%} and {%Apsarases%} and {%Kinnaras%} came there
(II, {@4@}).
