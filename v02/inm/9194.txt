{@Sabhākriyāparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the building
<div n="lb">of the palace,” the 20th of the minor parvans of the
<div n="lb">Mhbhr. Cf. Sabhākriyā). § 261: {%Maya%} said he was a great
<div n="lb">artist {%(mahākavi),%} the {%Viśvakarman%} of the {%Dānavas,%} and
<div n="lb">asked {%Arjuna%} to tell him what he was to do for him,
<div n="lb">because he had been rescued by him. {%Arjuna%} told him to
<div n="lb">do something for {%Kṛṣṇa (lokanāthaḥ Prajāpatiḥ,%} v. 9),
<div n="lb">who asked him to build a palace for {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Maya%}
<div n="lb">was introduced to {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and recited the history
<div n="lb">of the Asura {%(pūrvadeva-caritaṃ),%} i.e. of Vṛṣaparvan
<div n="lb">(so Nīl.). Then on an auspicious day, after the initiatory
<div n="lb">rites, and having gratified thousands of {%brahmans,%} he
<div n="lb">measured out a piece of land 10,000 {%kiṣkus%} square (II, {@1@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 262: Kṛṣṇa departed for {%Dvārakā%} (v. {%Bhagavad-%}
<div n="lb">{%yāna%}).—§ 263: To the north of {%Kailāsa,%} near {%Maināka,%}
<div n="lb">there is a huge mountain named {%Hiraṇyaśṛṅga,%} consisting of
<div n="lb">jewels. Near this mountain is situated the lake {%Bindusaras,%}
<div n="lb">where King {%Bhagīratha%} had dwelt for many years, desiring
<div n="lb">to behold the {%Gaṅgā.%} There the lord of all beings (i.e.
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpati,%} Nīl) had performed 100 sacrifices, where, for
<div n="lb">the sake of embellishment, though not according to rule
<div n="lb">{%(dṛṣtāntataḥ),%} the sacrificial stakes were made of gems and
[Page602-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">the altars {%(caityāḥ)%} of gold. There the 1,000-eyed {%Śacīpati%}
<div n="lb">had become perfect {%(siddhiṃ gataḥ)%} by sacrifice. There
<div n="lb">{%Bhūtapati%} (= {%Mahādera,%} Nīl.) took up his abode after having
<div n="lb">created all the worlds, and there he dwells, worshipped by
<div n="lb">thousands of spirits {%(bhūtaiḥ).%} There {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán, Yama,%} and {%Sthāṇu%} perform their sacrifices at the
<div n="lb">expiration of 1,000 {%yugas.%} There {%Vāsudeva%} has performed
<div n="lb">{%sattras%} for many years, and placed thousands and tens of
<div n="lb">thousands of sacrificial stakes adorned with golden garlands
<div n="lb">and altars of great splendour. There {%Maya,%} when the
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas%} wished to perform a sacrifice on the bank of the
<div n="lb">{%Bindusaras,%} had made utensils of gems from the house of
<div n="lb">{%Vṛṣaparvan.%} That wealth, which was guarded by {%Yakṣas%}
<div n="lb">and {%Rākṣasas,%} he brought away, and thereof constructed the
<div n="lb">palace of {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} A club with which {%Vṛṣaparvan%}
<div n="lb">had slain all foes in battle, and which had been placed in
<div n="lb">{%Bindusaras, Maya%} gave to {%Bhīmasena;%} the conch-shell
<div n="lb">{%Devadatta,%} that came from {%Varuṇa,%} and was also there, he
<div n="lb">gave to {%Arjuna;%} at its sound all creatures trembled in awe.
<div n="lb">The palace surpassed the {%Sudharmā%} of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and the
<div n="lb">palace of {%Brahmán,%} and covered an area of 10,000 {%kiṣkus%}
<div n="lb">square. Eight thousand {%Rākṣasas,%} called {%Kiṅkaras,%} guarded
<div n="lb">and supported the palace. In it was a tank, whose lotuses
<div n="lb">were of dark-coloured gems, etc.; many kings mistook it for
<div n="lb">solid ground, and fell into it. The palace was constructed in
<div n="lb">seventeen months (II, {@3@}).—§ 264: Enumeration of {%ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) and kings (<lang n="greek"></lang>) from various countries, who were present
<div n="lb">when {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} after having fed 10,000 brahmans. etc.,
<div n="lb">entered the palace. Also {%Tamburu,%} the friend of {%Dhanañjaya,%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Gandharva Citrasena%} with his ministers, and many
<div n="lb">other {%Gandharvas%} and {%Apsarases%} and {%Kinnaras%} came there
<div n="lb">(II, {@4@}).
