{@[Prajāgaraparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“section relating to the
sleeplessness of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,” the 59th of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.; cf. Prajāgara). § 557: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, after
{%Sañjaya%} had left him, requested {%Vidura%} to tell him what
may be good for a person that is sleepless and burning.
{%Vidura%} said that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was worthy of being the
sovereign over the three worlds, while the qualities of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} were the very reverse of those; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
had no right to a share in the kingdom owing to his being
[Page556-b+ 63]
blind; {%Vidura%} blamed him for having bestowed on {%Duryodhana%},
{%Śakuni, Karṇa%}, and {%Duḥśāsana%} the management of the
empire. Then he explained the marks of a wise man and
of a fool, quoting {%Bṛhaspati's%} answer to {%Indra%}, and alluding
to the conversation between {%Sudhanvan%} and {%Asurendra%}
[i.e. {%Prahlāda%}] in relation to the son of the latter (V, {@33@}).
Continuation of {%Vidura's%} discourse (V, {@34@}).—§ 558: {%Vidura%}
said that as long as a man's good deeds are spoken of in this
world, so long he is glorified in heaven, and cited the old
story about the conversation between {%Virocana%} (q.v.) and
{%Sudhanvan%}, both suitors for {%Keśinī's%} hand. “Entrusting the
cares of thy kingdom to {%Duryodhana, Śakuni%}, the foolish
{%Duḥśāsana%}, and to {%Karṇa%}, how canst thou hope for prosperity?
Possessed of every virtue, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} depend on thee as
their father; oh, confide thou in them as thy sons” (V, {@35@}).
—§ 559: {%Vidura%} related the old history of the discourse
between {%Ātreya%} and the {%Sādhyas%}, who received instruction
from {%Ātreya%} when he was wandering as a beggar (“…
One should not return the slanders or reproaches of others,
for the pain that is felt by him who suffers silently, consumes
the slanderer; and he that endures, succeeds also in
appropriating the virtues of the slanderer—the slanderer's
merits become his…The very gods desire company of
that man who, when abused, does not himself return the
abuse nor cause others to return it, or who, when beaten,
does not himself return the blow nor cause others to do it,
and who wishes not the slightest injury to him that injures
him…”). Then he explained what are those families
that are called high (“…let none in our race serve
a king as minister”) (V, {@36@}). {%Vidura%} spoke of the seven
and ten kinds of foolish men according to {%Manu Svāyam-%}
{%bhuva%}; of the reasons why not all men attain the allotted
period of life (100 years according to the {%Veda%}), etc. But
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} could not abandon his son (V, {@37—40@}).
