<div n="lb">(Mārk.): Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related the
<div n="lb">following “old story” {%(itihāsaṃ purātanaṃ): Aṅgiras%} (the
<div n="lb">third son of Brahmán, v. 14122) in days of yore practised
<div n="lb">austerities in his hermitage, so that he excelled {%Agni,%} who,
<div n="lb">thinking that {%Brahmán%} had created a new Fire, was greatly
<div n="lb">depressed, but {%Aṅgiras,%} saying that {%Agni%} had been created by
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} to officiate as fire, asked him to occupy his proper
<div n="lb">place, and when {%Agni%} only wished to be the second or {%Prājā-%}
<div n="lb">{%patyaka%} fire, at last prevailed upon him to remain and make
[Page040-a+ 142]
<div n="lb">him (i.e. Aṅgiras) his first son. {%Aṅgiras%} also had a son,
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati;%} knowing him the {%Āṅgirasa%} to be the firstborn son

<div n="lb">should become the food of all creatures in various ways. Then
<div n="lb">{%Saha%} gave up his body and entered the earth, where he created

<div n="lb">of rivers that are said to be the mothers of the fires. The wife
<div n="lb">of {%Adbhuta%} was {%Priyā,%} and his son {%Vibhūrasi%} (14234). There
<div n="lb">are as many {%somas%} (i.e. kinds of {%soma%} sacrifices, Nīl. and PCR.)

<div n="lb">[these] mind-born sons of {%Brahmán%} (?)
<sup>‡</sup> sprang forth. {%Atri,%}
<div n="lb">wishing to procreate sons, conceived these [fires] in his mind,
