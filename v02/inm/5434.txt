<div n="lb">him before, this journey did not please him, and advised him
<div n="lb">to make peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas. Duryodhana%} laughed and

<div n="lb">When {%Bhīṣma,%} ashamed, had gone away, they returned and
<div n="lb">began to consult. {%Karṇa%} complained of the partiality of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} for the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and promised to conquer the world
<div n="lb">for {%Duryodhana. Duryodhana%} gladly accepted his offer,
<div n="lb">and on an auspicious lunar day, etc., {%Karṇa%} set out (III,
<div n="lb">{@253@}). {%Karṇa,%} surrounded by a large army, first made
