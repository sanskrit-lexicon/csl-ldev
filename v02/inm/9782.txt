[{@Saubhavadhopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
to the destruction of Saubha”; cf. Saubhavadhākhyāna).
§ 319 (cf. Arjunābh.). {%Kṛṣṇa%} related: When {%Śiśupāla%}, the
son of {%Damaghoṣa%}, had been slain, his brother, the {%Mārttikā-%}
{%vata%}-king {%Śālva%}, in order to avenge him, came to {%Dvārakā%} in
the {%Saubha%}, who moved at will and slew many of the {%Vṛṣṇis%},
and sought for {%Kṛṣṇa%} desiring to kill him. {%Kṛṣṇa%} was in
{%Indraprastha%} at the {%rājasūya%} of Yudhiṣṭhira, and when he
learnt this on returning home, he set out to slay him, and found
him in an island in the ocean (see Nīl. and PCR.; BR. “a
bay”), and blowing his conch {%Pāñcajanya%}, slew numerous
{%Dānavas%}. Then, as soon as he heard of the game at dice, he
had come to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (III, {@14@}).—§ 320. Copious
description of the combats with {%Śālva%}: When {%Śālva%} attacked
{%Dvārakā%} it was well furnished and strongly fortified (descrip-
tion of fortifications and measures taken to defend the city by
{%Ugrasena, Uddhava%}, etc.) and defended by {%Gada, Śāmba%}, etc.
(III, {@15@}). {%Cārudeṣṇa%} (son of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rukmiṇī%}), {%Śāmba%}
(son of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Jāmbavatī%}), and {%Pradyumna%} (son of
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rukmiṇī%}) rushed out against him. They on both
sides fought by means of {%māyā. Śāmba%} put {%Kṣemarṛddhi%}, the
commander of {%Śālva's%} troops, to flight by a shower of
arrows, and slew a {%Daiteya%} named {%Vegavat%} with his mace.
{%Cārudeṣṇa%} slew the {%Dānava Vivindhya%} with a consecrated
arrow. Then {%Śālva%}, riding on {%Saubha%}, encountered
{%Pradyumna%} (III, {@16@}). Riding on his chariot with a gaping
{%makara%} in its standard, {%Pradyumna%} with showers of arrows
slew the {%Dānavas%} and pierced the heart of {%Śālva%} so that he
fell in a swoon, but he rose again and wounded {%Pradyumna%}
about his throat so that he became senseless (III, {@17@}).
{%Pradyumna's%} charioteer {%Dāruki%}, a {%sūta%}, carried him off the
field by the help of his fleet steeds, but when {%Pradyumna%} had
regained his senses, he ordered him to turn the chariot,
reminding him of the customs of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} in battle, and
saying that he had restrained {%Kṛtavarman%}, the son of {%Hṛdika%},
from sallying out, as he would himself resist {%Śālva%} (III, {@18@}).
As Śālva used his {%māyā%} of the {%Asuras, Pradyumna%} shot him
down with the {%Brahmāstra%}, and was about to aim another
arrow at him, capable of killing any person, when all the
hosts of the gods, with {%Indra%} and {%Dhaneśvara%} (i.e. Kubera),
sent {%Nārada%} and {%Śvasana%} (i.e. the Wind), who ordered him
to desist as the creator ({%Dhātṛ%}) had destined {%Kṛṣṇa%}, the son
of {%Devakī%}, to slay him. {%Śālva%} then mounted {%Saubha%} and
went away through the skies leaving {%Dvārakā%} (III, {@19@}).
When {%Śālva%} had left {%Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa%} returned from the
{%rājasūya%}, and found {%Dvārakā%} deprived of its splendour, etc.
[Page632-b+ 63]
He learnt from {%Hārdikya%} (i.e. Kṛtavarman) about the invasion
of {%Śālva%}, committed the city to the charge of king {%Āhuka%}
and {%Ānakadundubhi%} (i.e. Vasudeva), etc., bowed to {%Bhava%}
(i.e. Śiva), and set out on his chariot yoked with {%Śaibya%} and
{%Sugrīva%} and with {%Dāruka%} for his charioteer, blowing the
{%Pāñcajanya%}, till he arrived at {%Mārttikāvata%}, and pursued {%Śālva%}
({%Daiteyāpasadaḥ%}, v. 796), who, staying in {%Saubha%}, remained in
the sky above the midst of the ocean a {%krośa%} off, so that
{%Kṛṣṇa's%} soldiers could not see it, but were obliged to stand
as mere spectators. After a long battle with arrows, in
which {%Kṛṣṇa%} killed numerous {%Dānavas%}, they took to fight by
means of illusion, whirling maces, ploughshares, etc., and then
mountain peaks. As none could ascertain whether it was
day or night, or distinguish the points of the horizon, {%Kṛṣṇa%},
becoming bewildered, made use of the {%Prajñāstra%}, by which
he regained light (III, {@20@}). {%Dāruka%} was covered all over
with shafts. Then a messenger of {%Āhuka%} came from {%Dvārakā%},
saying that {%Śālva%} had come to {%Dvārakā%} and had slain
{%Vasudeva. Kṛṣṇa%} thought that then {%Sātyaki, Baladeva%},
{%Pradyumna, Cārudeṣṇa, Śāmba%}, etc., must necessarily have
been killed first. Now he saw {%Vasudeva%} falling from {%Saubha%},
and swooned away; but, as he, after regaining consciousness,
saw neither {%Saubha%}, nor {%Śālva%}, nor {%Vasudeva%}, he concluded
that it was illusion (III, {@21@}). Though {%Kṛṣṇa%} could not see
{%Saubha%}, which had vanished through illusion, he discharged
many arrows from the {%Śārṅga%}. The {%Dānavas%} set up a loud
howl, and when {%Kṛṣṇa%}, making use of a weapon that pierced
the foe following the sound, killed them at one place, the yell
ceased at that place and started from another quarter.
Then {%Saubha%} reappeared at {%Prāgjyotiṣa. Kṛṣṇa, Dāruka%}, and
the horses were covered by torrents of rocks that concealed
them, and the {%Vṛṣṇis%} fled in all directions. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then
destroyed the crags with {%Indra's%} thunderbolt, {%Dāruka%} pointed
at {%Śālva%} and exhorted {%Kṛṣṇa%} to slay him. {%Kṛṣṇa%} made
use of his {%Āgneya%} weapon and hurled his discus {%Sudarśana (b%})
against the city of {%Saubha%}, that fell cut in twain like the
city of {%Tripura%} by the shafts of {%Maheśvara%}. Then the discus
came back into his hands and was hurled against {%Śālva%} and
cut him in twain. The remaining {%Dānavas%} fled in fear.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} returned to the {%Ānarttas%}. It was for this reason
that he could not come to {%Hāstinapura%} and prevent the
gambling.—§ 321: Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} took leave of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
etc., and set out for {%Dvārakā%} in his chariot yoked with {%Śaibya%}
and {%Sugrīva%}, taking with him {%Subhadrā%} and {%Abhimanyu%}.
Then {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} set out for his own city, taking with
him the {%Draupadeyas%}. And the {%Cedi%} king, {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%}
({%Śiśupāla's%} son, Nīl.), set out for his beautiful city of
{%Śuktimatī%}, taking with him his sister [{%Kareṇumatī%}, the wife of
{%Nakula%}; Nīl., v. I, 3831]. Also the Kaikeyas (B. {%Kekayāḥ%};
{%Sahadevaśyālāḥ%}, Nīl.) went away. But the brahmans, {%vaiśyas%},
and inhabitants of the country would not leave the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in due time ordered his men to make the chariots
ready (III, {@22@}). (For continuation v. Dvaitavanaprav.)
