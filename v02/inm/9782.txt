[{@Saubhavadhopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
<div n="lb">to the destruction of Saubha”; cf. Saubhavadhākhyāna).
<div n="lb">§ 319 (cf. Arjunābh.). {%Kṛṣṇa%} related: When {%Śiśupāla,%} the
<div n="lb">son of {%Damaghoṣa,%} had been slain, his brother, the {%Mārttikā-%}
<div n="lb">{%vata%}-king {%Śālva,%} in order to avenge him, came to {%Dvārakā%} in
<div n="lb">the {%Saubha,%} who moved at will and slew many of the {%Vṛṣṇis,%}
<div n="lb">and sought for {%Kṛṣṇa%} desiring to kill him. {%Kṛṣṇa%} was in
<div n="lb">{%Indraprastha%} at the {%rājasūya%} of Yudhiṣṭhira, and when he
<div n="lb">learnt this on returning home, he set out to slay him, and found
<div n="lb">him in an island in the ocean (see Nīl. and PCR.; BR. “a
<div n="lb">bay”), and blowing his conch {%Pāñcajanya,%} slew numerous
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas.%} Then, as soon as he heard of the game at dice, he
<div n="lb">had come to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (III, {@14@}).—§ 320. Copious
<div n="lb">description of the combats with {%Śālva:%} When {%Śālva%} attacked
<div n="lb">{%Dvārakā%} it was well furnished and strongly fortified (descrip-
<div n="lb">tion of fortifications and measures taken to defend the city by
<div n="lb">{%Ugrasena, Uddhava,%} etc.) and defended by {%Gada, Śāmba,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(III, {@15@}). {%Cārudeṣṇa%} (son of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rukmiṇī%}), {%Śāmba%}
<div n="lb">(son of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Jāmbavatī%}), and {%Pradyumna%} (son of
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rukmiṇī%}) rushed out against him. They on both
<div n="lb">sides fought by means of {%māyā. Śāmba%} put {%Kṣemarṛddhi,%} the
<div n="lb">commander of {%Śālva's%} troops, to flight by a shower of
<div n="lb">arrows, and slew a {%Daiteya%} named {%Vegavat%} with his mace.
<div n="lb">{%Cārudeṣṇa%} slew the {%Dānava Vivindhya%} with a consecrated
<div n="lb">arrow. Then {%Śālva,%} riding on {%Saubha,%} encountered
<div n="lb">{%Pradyumna%} (III, {@16@}). Riding on his chariot with a gaping
<div n="lb">{%makara%} in its standard, {%Pradyumna%} with showers of arrows
<div n="lb">slew the {%Dānavas%} and pierced the heart of {%Śālva%} so that he
<div n="lb">fell in a swoon, but he rose again and wounded {%Pradyumna%}
<div n="lb">about his throat so that he became senseless (III, {@17@}).
<div n="lb">{%Pradyumna's%} charioteer {%Dāruki,%} a {%sūta,%} carried him off the
<div n="lb">field by the help of his fleet steeds, but when {%Pradyumna%} had
<div n="lb">regained his senses, he ordered him to turn the chariot,
<div n="lb">reminding him of the customs of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} in battle, and
<div n="lb">saying that he had restrained {%Kṛtavarman,%} the son of {%Hṛdika,%}
<div n="lb">from sallying out, as he would himself resist {%Śālva%} (III, {@18@}).
<div n="lb">As Śālva used his {%māyā%} of the {%Asuras, Pradyumna%} shot him
<div n="lb">down with the {%Brahmāstra,%} and was about to aim another
<div n="lb">arrow at him, capable of killing any person, when all the
<div n="lb">hosts of the gods, with {%Indra%} and {%Dhaneśvara%} (i.e. Kubera),
<div n="lb">sent {%Nārada%} and {%Śvasana%} (i.e. the Wind), who ordered him
<div n="lb">to desist as the creator {%(Dhātṛ)%} had destined {%Kṛṣṇa,%} the son
<div n="lb">of {%Devakī,%} to slay him. {%Śālva%} then mounted {%Saubha%} and
<div n="lb">went away through the skies leaving {%Dvārakā%} (III, {@19@}).
<div n="lb">When {%Śālva%} had left {%Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa%} returned from the
<div n="lb">{%rājasūya,%} and found {%Dvārakā%} deprived of its splendour, etc.
[Page632-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">He learnt from {%Hārdikya%} (i.e. Kṛtavarman) about the invasion
<div n="lb">of {%Śālva,%} committed the city to the charge of king {%Āhuka%}
<div n="lb">and {%Ānakadundubhi%} (i.e. Vasudeva), etc., bowed to {%Bhava%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Śiva), and set out on his chariot yoked with {%Śaibya%} and
<div n="lb">{%Sugrīva%} and with {%Dāruka%} for his charioteer, blowing the
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcajanya,%} till he arrived at {%Mārttikāvata,%} and pursued {%Śālva%}
<div n="lb">({%Daiteyāpasadaḥ,%} v. 796), who, staying in {%Saubha,%} remained in
<div n="lb">the sky above the midst of the ocean a {%krośa%} off, so that
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa's%} soldiers could not see it, but were obliged to stand
<div n="lb">as mere spectators. After a long battle with arrows, in
<div n="lb">which {%Kṛṣṇa%} killed numerous {%Dānavas,%} they took to fight by
<div n="lb">means of illusion, whirling maces, ploughshares, etc., and then
<div n="lb">mountain peaks. As none could ascertain whether it was
<div n="lb">day or night, or distinguish the points of the horizon, {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">becoming bewildered, made use of the {%Prajñāstra,%} by which
<div n="lb">he regained light (III, {@20@}). {%Dāruka%} was covered all over
<div n="lb">with shafts. Then a messenger of {%Āhuka%} came from {%Dvārakā,%}
<div n="lb">saying that {%Śālva%} had come to {%Dvārakā%} and had slain
<div n="lb">{%Vasudeva. Kṛṣṇa%} thought that then {%Sātyaki, Baladeva,%}
<div n="lb">{%Pradyumna, Cārudeṣṇa, Śāmba,%} etc., must necessarily have
<div n="lb">been killed first. Now he saw {%Vasudeva%} falling from {%Saubha,%}
<div n="lb">and swooned away; but, as he, after regaining consciousness,
<div n="lb">saw neither {%Saubha,%} nor {%Śālva,%} nor {%Vasudeva,%} he concluded
<div n="lb">that it was illusion (III, {@21@}). Though {%Kṛṣṇa%} could not see
<div n="lb">{%Saubha,%} which had vanished through illusion, he discharged
<div n="lb">many arrows from the {%Śārṅga.%} The {%Dānavas%} set up a loud
<div n="lb">howl, and when {%Kṛṣṇa,%} making use of a weapon that pierced
<div n="lb">the foe following the sound, killed them at one place, the yell
<div n="lb">ceased at that place and started from another quarter.
<div n="lb">Then {%Saubha%} reappeared at {%Prāgjyotiṣa. Kṛṣṇa, Dāruka,%} and
<div n="lb">the horses were covered by torrents of rocks that concealed
<div n="lb">them, and the {%Vṛṣṇis%} fled in all directions. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then
<div n="lb">destroyed the crags with {%Indra's%} thunderbolt, {%Dāruka%} pointed
<div n="lb">at {%Śālva%} and exhorted {%Kṛṣṇa%} to slay him. {%Kṛṣṇa%} made
<div n="lb">use of his {%Āgneya%} weapon and hurled his discus {%Sudarśana (b)%}
<div n="lb">against the city of {%Saubha,%} that fell cut in twain like the
<div n="lb">city of {%Tripura%} by the shafts of {%Maheśvara.%} Then the discus
<div n="lb">came back into his hands and was hurled against {%Śālva%} and
<div n="lb">cut him in twain. The remaining {%Dānavas%} fled in fear.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} returned to the {%Ānarttas.%} It was for this reason
<div n="lb">that he could not come to {%Hāstinapura%} and prevent the
<div n="lb">gambling.—§ 321: Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} took leave of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">etc., and set out for {%Dvārakā%} in his chariot yoked with {%Śaibya%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sugrīva,%} taking with him {%Subhadrā%} and {%Abhimanyu.%}
<div n="lb">Then {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} set out for his own city, taking with
<div n="lb">him the {%Draupadeyas.%} And the {%Cedi%} king, {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%}
<div n="lb">({%Śiśupāla's%} son, Nīl.), set out for his beautiful city of
<div n="lb">{%Śuktimatī,%} taking with him his sister [{%Kareṇumatī,%} the wife of
<div n="lb">{%Nakula;%} Nīl., v. I, 3831]. Also the Kaikeyas (B. {%Kekayāḥ;%}
<div n="lb">{%Sahadevaśyālāḥ,%} Nīl.) went away. But the brahmans, {%vaiśyas,%}
<div n="lb">and inhabitants of the country would not leave the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in due time ordered his men to make the chariots
<div n="lb">ready (III, {@22@}). (For continuation v. Dvaitavanaprav.)
