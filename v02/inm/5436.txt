<div n="lb">MORNING, AND BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVEN-
<div n="lb">TEENTH DAYS. After {%Droṇa's%} death the {%Kuru%} warriors in grief,
<div n="lb">with {%Duryodhana%} at their head, repaired to {%Aśvatthāman.%}
<div n="lb">When night came (!) they proceeded to their tents, but
<div n="lb">could not sleep (<lang n="greek"></lang>); they (<lang n="greek"></lang>) passed that night together in
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana's%} tent, reflecting (<lang n="greek"></lang>). When morning came they
[Page390-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">rose and performed their customary rites. Arranging their
<div n="lb">troops they proceeded to battle, making {%Karṇa%} their leader.
<div n="lb">The {%Pāṇḍavas%} also proceeded to battle. {%Karṇa%} fought for
<div n="lb">two days and was then slain by {%Arjuna. Sañjaya%} repaired
<div n="lb">to {%Hāstinapura%} and informed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of {%Karṇa's%} fall.
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} inquired about {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and the details of
<div n="lb">the battle (VIII, {@1@}). {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: After the fall of
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa, Sañjaya%} set out that night for {%Hāstinapura%} and spoke
<div n="lb">with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@2@}). {%Sañjaya%} related the dis-
<div n="lb">couragement of the {%Kuru%} army after the fall of {%Droṇa; Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana's%} spirited address; {%Karṇa%} was made generalissimo but
<div n="lb">slain by {%Arjuna%} on the second day (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@3@}). Hearing
<div n="lb">of {%Karṇa's%} fall in battle, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away; he
<div n="lb">and the ladies were restored to their senses; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">inquired whether {%Duryodhana%} was still alive; {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">informed him of {%Duḥśāsana's%} slaughter (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@4@}).
<div n="lb">Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} recounted the names

<div n="lb">{%Droṇa's%} fall the {%Kauravas,%} having fled and been rallied by
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} fought for a long time with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">{%(Arjuna).%} On the approach of the evening twilight(!)
<div n="lb">the {%Kauravas%} retired to their encampment; they held a
<div n="lb">consultation in the night; {%Duryodhana%} inquired of his
<div n="lb">counsellors as to what should next be done. {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">suggested the installation of {%Karṇa%} as generalissimo (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} offered {%Karṇa%} the command, which {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">accepted, promising to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Karṇa%} was
<div n="lb">installed in the command and blessed by the brahmans, and
<div n="lb">ordered the troops to be arrayed at the rise of the sun (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@10@}). Beholding {%Karṇa,%} none recked the loss of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} or {%Droṇa,%} etc. He formed a {%makara%} array: the
<div n="lb">tip (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the two eyes (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the head (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the neck (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the
<div n="lb">middle (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the left foot (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the right foot (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the left
<div n="lb">hind-foot (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the right hind-foot (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the tail (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">asked {%Arjuna%} to array the {%Pāṇḍava%} army and slay {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">(“incapable of being vanquished by…D., As., G., K., and
<div n="lb">M.-U.”). The {%Pāṇḍava%} troops were arrayed in the shape
<div n="lb">of the half-moon; the left side (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the right side (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the
<div n="lb">middle (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the rear (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Yudhāmanyu%} and {%Uttamaujas%} became
<div n="lb">the protectors of {%Arjuna's%} chariot wheels, and did not quit
<div n="lb">him for a moment. Then commenced the battle (VIII, {@11@}).
<div n="lb">A fierce slaughter on both sides (description). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), headed by {%Bhīmasena & Kṣemadhūrti (Kulūtādhi-%}

<div n="lb">{%& Bhīmasena%} (VIII, {@14@}); Si., Cā., D., and M.-ṛ., applauded
<div n="lb">them; both were borne away insensible by their drivers (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@15@}). {%Arjuna%} & the {%Saṃśaptakas;%} Si., D.-ṛ., and Cā. applauded
<div n="lb">him, etc. {%Aśvatthāman & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa),%} who fought
[Page391-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">also the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (VIII, {@16@}); the {%Kaliṅga, Vaṅga,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Niṣāda%} heroes attacked {%Arjuna%} with a division of elephants,
<div n="lb">which was broken; {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} not to spare
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman,%} who at last was borne away by his steeds and
<div n="lb">entered the army of {%Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} proceeded
<div n="lb">towards the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (VIII, {@17@}). The {%Magadha%} chief
<div n="lb">(lord of {%Girivraja%}) {%Daṇḍadhāra%} massacred the {%Pāṇḍava%} army.
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} (urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%}) & {%Daṇḍadhāra%} (on an elephant),
<div n="lb">whom he slew; his brother {%Daṇḍa & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa),%}
<div n="lb">who slew him; the hostile force broke up: {%Arjuna%} proceeded
<div n="lb">once more against the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (VIII, {@18@}), whom he

<div n="lb">described the dismal sights of the field of battle “for the
<div n="lb">sake of {%Duryodhana%} alone”. The army of {%Duryodhana%} was
<div n="lb">defeated by {%Pāṇḍya%} (VIII, {@19@}), who regarded himself as
<div n="lb">superior to {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and was slaughtering the army
<div n="lb">of {%Karṇa,%} the {%Pulindas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Aśvatthāman & Pāṇḍya (b),%}
<div n="lb">who employed the {%Vāyavya%} weapon; mean while {%Karṇa%} began
<div n="lb">to rout the elephant force of the {%Pāṇḍavas; Pāṇḍya%} ascended
<div n="lb">a riderless elephant and split {%Aśvatthāman's%} diadem; then
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} slew him, who had given numerous steeds,
<div n="lb">men, and elephants as food to the Rā. {%Duryodhana%} and his
<div n="lb">brothers worshipped {%Karṇa%} (VIII, {@20@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} that he did not see {%Yudhiṣṭhira;%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had
<div n="lb">retreated, and {%Karṇa%} was slaying the {%Sṛñjayas.%} The {%Kurus%}
<div n="lb">(headed by {%Karṇa%}) & the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (headed by {%Bhīmasena%});

<div n="lb">and the {%Pāñcālas%} come to the aid of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Nakula,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), overloaded the elephants with their weapons; {%Sātyaki%}
<div n="lb">killed the elephant of the {%Vaṅga%} king and felled the rider;
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva & Puṇḍra,%} whose elephant he slew, and then
<div n="lb">proceeded towards the {%Aṅga%} chief; {%Nakula%} & the {%Aṅga%} king
<div n="lb">({%Mleccha%} king), whom he slew; the elephant-men of the
<div n="lb">{%Aṅgas + Mekalas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), & {%Nakula;%} then the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), rushed to the rescue of {%Nakula; Sahadeva%} slew eight
<div n="lb">elephants and {%Nakula%} many; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">overloaded the elephants with arrows; the hostile army fled
<div n="lb">away and the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors rushed against {%Karṇa%} (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@22@}). {%Sahadeva & Duḥśāsana,%} who was taken away by his
<div n="lb">charioteer; {%Sahadeva%} crushed {%Duryodhana's%} division (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@23@}). {%Karṇa & Nakula;%} both the {%Somakas%} and {%Kurus%} were
<div n="lb">greatly afflicted; {%Nakula%} fled on foot; {%Karṇa%} pursued him and
<div n="lb">placed his stringed bow around his neck, but let him escape,
<div n="lb">recollecting the words of {%Kuntī; Nakula%} in great shame
<div n="lb">proceeded towards {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} chariot, which he ascended.
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} at noon made a great slaughter among the {%Pāñśālas%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Sṛñjayas,%} and pursued them (VIII, {@24@}). {%Ulūka &%}
<div n="lb">{%Yuyutsu,%} who was vanquished and mounted another chariot.
<div n="lb">{%Ulūka%} slaughtered the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Sṛñjayas. Śruta-%}
<div n="lb">{%karman (Dhārtarāṣṭra) & Śatānīka;%} both were deprived

<div n="lb">{%Sutasoma,%} who was deprived of his chariot, but contended on
<div n="lb">foot with {%Śakuni,%} who fought from his chariot; the Si., etc.,
<div n="lb">were highly pleased; {%Sutasoma%} went to the chariot of {%Śrutakīrti;%}
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni%} slew many of the {%Pāṇḍava%} army (VIII, {@25@}). {%Kṛpa%}
<div n="lb">{%& Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} who got bewildered and let his charioteer
<div n="lb">carry him to {%Bhīmasena,%} pursued by {%Kṛpa. Kṛtavarman%} (the
<div n="lb">{%Bhoja%} king) & {%Śikhaṇḍin,%} who fell into a swoon, and was borne
[Page391-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">away by his charioteer; the {%Pāṇḍava%} army fled (VIII, {@26@}).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} & the {%Trigartas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Arjuna%} slew king {%Śatruñ-%}
<div n="lb">{%jaya,%} and {%Suśruta's%} son, and {%Candradeva;%} King {%Satyasena%}
<div n="lb">wounded {%Kṛṣṇa%} and was slain by {%Arjuna,%} who then slew

<div n="lb">and {%Mitrasena,%} and wounded {%Suśarman;%} all the {%Saṃśaptakas%}
<div n="lb">attacked {%Arjuna,%} who invoked the {%Aindra%} weapon (description);
<div n="lb">the hostile army fled away almost entirely (VIII, {@27@}).
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana & Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who deprived him of his chariot;
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), rushed to his aid; the other sons of {%Pāṇḍu%}
<div n="lb">surrounded {%Yudhiṣṭhira;%} the {%Pāñcālas%} & the {%Kauravas%}
<div n="lb">(description); {%Karṇa%} slaughtered the {%Pāñcālas, Arjuna%} the
<div n="lb">{%Trigartas, Bhīmasena%} the {%Kurus%} and their elephant division,
<div n="lb">when the sun had passed the meridian (VIII, {@28@}); {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} (on another chariot) & {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">swooned away; {%Bhīmasena%} prevented {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} from
<div n="lb">slaying {%Duryodhana; Kṛtavarman & Bhīmasena%} in the after-
<div n="lb">noon (VIII, {@29@}). The {%Kurus%} (placing {%Karṇa%} at their van)
<div n="lb">& the {%Pāṇḍava%} army (and {%Sātyaki%}); {%Karṇa & Sātyaki;%}
<div n="lb">many {%Kurus%} came to rescue {%Karṇa,%} but fled away before the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} who were headed by the sons of {%Drupada; Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (having said their daily prayers and worshipped
<div n="lb">{%Bhava%}) destroyed the {%Kurus; Duryodhana & Arjuna; Arjuna &%}
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman + Kṛpa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), & {%Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">who vanquished them; {%Arjuna & Karṇa;%} many {%Kurus%} fled
<div n="lb">away. At the close of the day both armies withdrew; Rā.
<div n="lb">and Pś., etc., appeared (VIII, {@30@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} exalted the
<div n="lb">prowess of {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The {%Kurus,%} in grief, took counsel of
<div n="lb">one another; {%Karṇa%} assured {%Duryodhana%} that he would slay
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} on the morrow. On the morrow they beheld an
<div n="lb">invincible array formed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} according to the
<div n="lb">rules of {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Uśanas. Duryodhana%} and his troops
<div n="lb">put confidence in {%Karṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} grief (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">rebuked him by reminding him of his evil acts (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">At dawn {%Karṇa%} repeated before {%Duryodhana%} his pledge to
<div n="lb">slaughter {%Arjuna;%} “my bow {%Vijaya (c)%} is the foremost
<div n="lb">of all weapons;…{%Arjuna%} is superior to me only by having
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} (‘the Creator of the Universe’) for his charioteer, the
<div n="lb">chariot given him by {%Agni,%} his steed, and his standard with
<div n="lb">the Ape.” He desired to have {%Śalya%} (“who is superior to
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%}”) to drive his chariot; {%Duryodhana%} solicited {%Śalya%}
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@31@}) to comply with {%Karṇa's%} wishes (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Śalya%} took
<div n="lb">offence at the proposal (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Duryodhana%} repeated his request
<div n="lb">in honorific words (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and {%Śalya%} accepted on the condition
<div n="lb">that he might in {%Karṇa's%} presence, utter whatever he desired
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@32@}). § 606: {%Duryodhana%} related to {%Śalya%}
<div n="lb">Tripurākhyāna (q.v.), which the great Ṛ. {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} had
<div n="lb">narrated to his father. “As {%Brahmán,%}…the Supreme
<div n="lb">Deity acted as the driver of {%Rudra,%} so do thou restrain the
<div n="lb">steeds of {%Karṇa%}” (VIII, {@33@}). He then related a story
<div n="lb">of {%Paraśu-Rāma (b),%} which a virtuous brahman had recited in
<div n="lb">the presence of his father. {%Rāma%} gave the {%Dhanurveda%} to
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} “whom I do not think to have been born in the
<div n="lb">{%Sūta%} order, but to be the son of a god, born in the {%Kṣatriya%}
<div n="lb">order and abandoned in infancy” (VIII, {@34@}). {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">said: “So did {%Brahman%} act as {%Rudra's%} driver; the driver
<div n="lb">should be superior to the warrior; thou art selected by us as
<div n="lb">superior to {%Karṇa.%}” {%Śalya%} said that many a time he had
<div n="lb">heard this history recited to him, and {%Kṛṣṇa,%} knowing the
<div n="lb">same, had become the charioteer of {%Arjuna,%} and would fight if
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} were slain. {%Duryodhana%} eulogized {%Karṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and
<div n="lb">then {%Śalya%} (etymology) as superior to {%Kṛṣṇa. Śalya%}
<div n="lb">repeated his promise and condition. {%Duryodhana%} embraced
[Page392-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} and, requested by him, once more obtained the promise
<div n="lb">of {%Śalya,%} who embraced {%Duryodhana%} and asked their forgiveness
<div n="lb">for the words he might speak to {%Karṇa%} for his good; “what
<div n="lb">I shall say, in order to inspire thee confidence, is fraught with
<div n="lb">self-adulation; I am a driver like {%Mātali%} himself” (VIII, {@35@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 607: {%Duryodhana%} said to {%Karṇa:%} “{%Śalya,%} who is superior
<div n="lb">to {%Kṛṣṇa,%} will act as a driver, like {%Mātali%} to {%Indra.%}” When
<div n="lb">the morning came, {%Duryodhana%} again successfully asked
<div n="lb">{%Śalya%} to become {%Karṇa's%} charioteer. {%Karṇa%} having worshipped
<div n="lb">the chariot (which had in days of old been sanctified by a priest),
<div n="lb">they both ascended it. {%Duryodhana%} once more addressed {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Karṇa%} told {%Śalya%} to urge the steeds that he might slay
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Śalya%} endeavoured to inspire {%Karṇa%} with
<div n="lb">fear by eulogizing the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (VIII, {@36@}). When {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">set out there appeared ill omens. The {%Kuru%} army, however,
<div n="lb">was filled with joy. {%Karṇa%} reflected and boasted (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Śalya%}
<div n="lb">ridiculed him and praised {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Karṇa%} proceeded on
<div n="lb">his chariot with white steeds and tiger-skins, slaying large
<div n="lb">numbers in battle along his way, and inquired after {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@37@}), promising every {%Pāṇḍava%} soldier that he
<div n="lb">met that unto him who pointed out {%Arjuna%} to him he
<div n="lb">would give whatever wealth he desired. {%Duryodhana%} and
<div n="lb">the troops rejoiced; {%Śalya%} scornfully laughed, and said
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@38@}) that {%Karṇa%} would get to see {%Arjuna%} without
<div n="lb">the trouble of seeking him, and asked him to abandon his
<div n="lb">desire for a single combat with {%Arjuna. Karṇa%} repeated
<div n="lb">his resolution, and {%Śalya%} insulted him in a long speech
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@39@}). {%Karṇa%} replied angrily, describing the dis-
<div n="lb">reputable practices of the {%Madrakas%} (and the {%Gāndhārakas%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sindhu-Sauvīras%}) (VIII, {@40@}). {%Śalya%} answered by praising
<div n="lb">himself and his accomplishments as a charioteer (description),
<div n="lb">and by reciting the story of the crow and the swan ({%Haṃsa-%}
<div n="lb">{%kākīyopākhyāna,%} q.v.): “Even as that crow, fed upon the
<div n="lb">remains of the dinners of the {%Vaiśya%} children, disregarded
<div n="lb">his equals and superiors, so dost thou, that art fed by the sons
<div n="lb">of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} upon the remains of their dishes, disregard
<div n="lb">all,” etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@41@}). {%Karṇa%} said that {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">were well known to him, but did not make him afraid.
<div n="lb">The curse, however, of {%[Paraśu-]Rāma%} pained him greatly.
<div n="lb">He dwelt, disguised as a brahman, with {%Rāma%} in former days,
<div n="lb">desirous of obtaining celestial weapons from him. {%Indra,%} as
<div n="lb">a worm, began to pierce his thigh, on which was lying the
<div n="lb">head of the sleeping {%Rāma;%} therefore he did not move. But
<div n="lb">{%Rāma,%} witnessing his patience, discovered that he was not
<div n="lb">a brahman, and cursed him, saying that this weapon would
<div n="lb">never, in the time of need, when the hour of his death came,
<div n="lb">occur to his memory. He had forgotten the weapon, but would,
<div n="lb">notwithstanding, slay {%Arjuna;%} he suspected {%Śalya%} of secret
<div n="lb">friendship with the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} he would employ the {%Brāhma%}
<div n="lb">weapon, which {%Arjuna%} would never be able to escape, if only
<div n="lb">the wheels of {%Karṇa's%} chariot did not sink into the earth that
<div n="lb">day; he would not take fright at {%Yama%} himself with his rod,
<div n="lb">or {%Varuṇa%} with his noose, or {%Kubera%} with his mace, or {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">with the thunderbolt. “Once upon a time, while wandering
<div n="lb">for the sake of practising with my bow {%Vijaya,%} I had
<div n="lb">heedlessly struck the calf of a brahman's {%homa%} cow; the
<div n="lb">brahman cursed me, saying that my wheel would sink
<div n="lb">into the earth in a battle when I was in great danger.
<div n="lb">The kings of the Lunar race offered to give that brahman
<div n="lb">1,000 kine and 600 bulls, but in vain,” etc. (VIII, {@42@}).
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} said that it was in vain that {%Śalya%} tried to frighten
<div n="lb">him (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@43@}). {%Karṇa%} said that in {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} abode
<div n="lb">the brahmans used to give accounts of various delightful
[Page392-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">regions and many kings of ancient times; an old brahman
<div n="lb">had said, blaming the {%Madrakas%} and the {%Bāhīkas,%} that they
<div n="lb">should be avoided as being out of the pale of virtue and living
<div n="lb">away from {%Himavat,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), but between Sindhu and its
<div n="lb">tributary rivers. On some very secret mission {%Karṇa%} had to
<div n="lb">live among the {%Bāhīkas,%} and therefore their conduct was well
<div n="lb">known to him; “there is a town {%Śākala,%} a river {%Āpagā,%} and
<div n="lb">a {%Bāhīka%} clan {%Jarttikas;%} the practices of these people are
<div n="lb">very censurable” (description; an example is cited of a
<div n="lb">{%Bāhīka%} who happened to live for some days in {%Kurujāṅgala,%}
<div n="lb">and a Rā. woman in {%Śākala;%} the rivers {%Śatadru,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the countries of the {%Āraṭṭas,%} regions without

<div n="lb">bowed to {%Brahmán%} and invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon, which
<div n="lb">could be applied by the wind alone; {%Karṇa%} baffled it;
<div n="lb">urged by {%Bhīma, Arjuna%} applied a second {%Brāhma%} weapon,
<div n="lb">which caused a great carnage among the {%Kaurava%} troops
<div n="lb">(description). {%Karṇa & Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">shot at {%Karṇa%} and {%Śalya,%} and slew {%Sabhāpati,%} etc.
<div n="lb">The {%Kauravas%} urged {%Karṇa%} to slay {%Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">appeared in order to witness the encounter. {%Arjuna's%} bow-
<div n="lb">string broke; {%Karṇa%} took advantage of the interval to hit
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Karṇa%} employed as arrows five snakes
<div n="lb">that had sided with {%Takṣaka's%} son [i.e. Aśvasena, at
<div n="lb">Khāṇḍava]; they penetrated {%Kṛṣṇa's%} body, entered the
<div n="lb">earth, and, having bathed [in Bhogavatī], returned to
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} but were cut off by {%Arjuna,%} who then covered
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa's%} chariot with showers of arrows and slew 2,000
<div n="lb">{%Kurus,%} who had been urged by {%Duryodhana%} to fight. The
<div n="lb">{%Kurus%} fled, leaving {%Karṇa%} to fight singly with {%Arjuna%} (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@89@}). {%Karṇa%} baffled {%Arjuna's%} weapon; {%Karṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">shot at each other dense showers of arrows. The snake
<div n="lb">{%Aśvasena,%} who was hostile to {%Arjuna,%} was passing his time in
<div n="lb">the nether region, having escaped from the conflagration at
<div n="lb">{%Khāṇḍava;%} recollecting the death of his mother he now soared
<div n="lb">up and entered into {%Karṇa's%} quiver in the shape of an arrow.
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} were fanned and sprinkled with fragrant
<div n="lb">sandal water by many Aps. staying in the welkin, and {%Śakra%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sūrya%} with their hands gently brushed their faces. {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">aimed that arrow, born in {%Airāvata's%} race (i.e. the snake in
<div n="lb">the shape of an arrow), which he had long kept for {%Arjuna's%}
<div n="lb">destruction, and which lay singly in a golden quiver amid
<div n="lb">sandal dust; omens appeared, and the {%Lokapālas%} with {%Śakra%}
<div n="lb">raised loud wails. {%Karṇa%} did not know that the snake
<div n="lb">{%Aśvasena%} had entered his arrow by the aid of his {%yoga%} powers.
<div n="lb">{%Śalya%} in vain exhorted {%Karṇa%} to take another arrow; {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">said: “{%Karṇa%} never aims an arrow twice; persons like us
<div n="lb">never become crooked warriors.” {%Kṛṣṇa%} with his feet
<div n="lb">pressed {%Arjuna's%} chariot about a cubit into the earth, and the
<div n="lb">snake-arrow, failing to strike off {%Arjuna's%} head, broke his
<div n="lb">diadem (made by {%Svayambhū%} for {%Indra > Arjuna%}), incapable
<div n="lb">of being crushed by {%Rudra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Celestial flowers were
<div n="lb">showered upon {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. {%Aśvasena%} appeared to {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">and asked him to shoot the same weapon again; {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">refused to avail himself of another's help or shoot the same
<div n="lb">shaft twice. {%Aśvasena%} then, of his own accord, rushed on
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} in the shape of an arrow; {%Kṛṣṇa%} informed {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">that it was {%Aśvasena,%} who, as an unborn child, was saved with
<div n="lb">his mother at {%Khāṇḍava. Arjuna%} cut the snake into pieces,
<div n="lb">and {%Krṣṇa%} with his arms raised the chariot from the earth.
[Page396-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">Once, when {%Karṇa%} was stupefied and stood inactive, {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">was disinclined to slay him in such distress, but he was
<div n="lb">taught by {%Kṛṣṇa%} never to spare an enemy, however weak.
<div n="lb">At that time, when the hour of {%Karṇa's%} death had come,
<div n="lb">{%Kāla,%} approaching invisibly, in consequence of the brahman's
<div n="lb">wrath, said “the earth is swallowing up thy wheel,” and
<div n="lb">the weapon that {%Rāma%} had given him escaped from his
<div n="lb">memory, and the earth engulfed his left wheel. {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">began to rail at righteousness as not always protecting
<div n="lb">its worshippers. {%Karṇa%} invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon, and
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} the {%Aindra%} weapon, which was baffled by {%Karṇa;%}
<div n="lb">urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%} to “shoot high weapons,” {%Arjuna%} shot the
<div n="lb">{%Brāhma%} weapon. {%Karṇa%} cut off, one after another, eleven
<div n="lb">bowstrings of {%Arjuna's,%} not knowing that {%Arjuna%} had one
<div n="lb">hundred strings to his bow; urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%} to strike
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} with “superior weapons,” {%Arjuna%} then consecrated
<div n="lb">another celestial weapon with {%mantras,%} uniting the {%Raudra%}
<div n="lb">weapon with it. At that time the earth swallowed up
<div n="lb">one of {%Karṇa's%} wheels. Quickly alighting, {%Karṇa%} seized
<div n="lb">his sunken wheel with his two arms and endeavoured to lift
<div n="lb">it up; the earth rose up to the height of four fingers breadth,
<div n="lb">with her seven islands, etc.; {%Karṇa%} shed tears from wrath and
<div n="lb">asked {%Arjuna%} to wait for a moment till he had lifted his sunken
<div n="lb">wheel (VIII, {@90@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} taunted {%Karṇa%} for appealing to
<div n="lb">virtue and the rules of fair fight by reminding him of all the
<div n="lb">wrongs done to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by himself. and {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">acting according to his counsels (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Karṇa%} dropped his
<div n="lb">head in shame and gave no answer, and continued to fight.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} to pierce {%Karṇa%} with a celestial weapon;
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} remembering the incidents alluded to by {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">blazed up with fury; blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate
<div n="lb">from all the pores of his body, a sight that appeared
<div n="lb">exceedingly wonderful. Both {%Karṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} invoked
<div n="lb">the {%Brāhma%} weapon, and {%Karṇa%} once more made an effort to
<div n="lb">extricate his chariot. {%Arjuna%} shot an {%Agni%} weapon, quenched
<div n="lb">by {%Karṇa%} with a {%Vāruṇa%} weapon, covering all the points of
<div n="lb">the compass with darkness, which {%Arjuna%} dispelled with the
<div n="lb">{%Vāyavya%} weapon. Pierced by a shaft of {%Karṇa's,%} while the
<div n="lb">earth trembled, etc., {%Arjuna%} began to reel, the {%Gāṇḍīva%}
<div n="lb">dropped from his hand, etc. At the interval {%Karṇa%} fruitlessly
<div n="lb">endeavoured to extricate his chariot. Recovering his senses,
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} took up an {%añjalika%} weapon. Urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%} to
<div n="lb">cut off the head of {%Karṇa, Arjuna%} cut off his standard, and
<div n="lb">then, with an {%añjalika%} weapon (the Ṛ. loudly crying out
