§ 604: THE NIGHT AFTER DROṆA'S DEATH, AND THE SIXTEENTH
MORNING, AND BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVEN-
TEENTH DAYS. After {%Droṇa's%} death the {%Kuru%} warriors in grief,
with {%Duryodhana%} at their head, repaired to {%Aśvatthāman%}.
<is>When night came</is> (!) they proceeded to their tents, but
could not sleep (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); they (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) passed that night together in
{%Duryodhana's%} tent, reflecting (<lang n="greek">β</lang>). When morning came they
[Page390-b+ 63]
rose and performed their customary rites. Arranging their
troops they proceeded to battle, making {%Karṇa%} their leader.
The {%Pāṇḍavas%} also proceeded to battle. {%Karṇa%} fought for
two days and was then slain by {%Arjuna. Sañjaya%} repaired
to {%Hāstinapura%} and informed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of {%Karṇa's%} fall.
{%Janamejaya%} inquired about {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and the details of
the battle (VIII, {@1@}). {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: After the fall of
{%Karṇa, Sañjaya%} set out that night for {%Hāstinapura%} and spoke
with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>) (VIII, {@2@}). {%Sañjaya%} related the dis-
couragement of the {%Kuru%} army after the fall of {%Droṇa; Duryo-%}
{%dhana's%} spirited address; {%Karṇa%} was made generalissimo but
slain by {%Arjuna%} on the second day (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (VIII, {@3@}). Hearing
of {%Karṇa's%} fall in battle, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away; he
and the ladies were restored to their senses; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
inquired whether {%Duryodhana%} was still alive; {%Sañjaya%}
informed him of {%Duḥśāsana's%} slaughter (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>) (VIII, {@4@}).
Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} recounted the names
of those that had fallen and those that were still alive;
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} once more swooned away (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>) (VIII, {@5—7@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} lament for {%Karṇa%} (<lang n="greek">η</lang>) (VIII, {@8@}); {%Sañjaya%}
endeavoured to comfort him; continuation of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
lament (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>) (VIII, {@9@}).—§ 605. THE SIXTEENTH DAY: After
{%Droṇa's%} fall the {%Kauravas%}, having fled and been rallied by
{%Duryodhana%}, fought for a long time with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
({%Arjuna%}). <is>On the approach of the evening twilight</is> (!)
the {%Kauravas%} retired to their encampment; they held a
consultation in the night; {%Duryodhana%} inquired of his
counsellors as to what should next be done. {%Aśvatthāman%}
suggested the installation of {%Karṇa%} as generalissimo (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>).
{%Duryodhana%} offered {%Karṇa%} the command, which {%Karṇa%}
accepted, promising to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>). {%Karṇa%} was
installed in the command and blessed by the brahmans, and
ordered the troops to be arrayed at the rise of the sun (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>)
(VIII, {@10@}). Beholding {%Karṇa%}, none recked the loss of
{%Bhīṣma%} or {%Droṇa%}, etc. He formed a {%makara%} array: the
tip (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), the two eyes (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>), the head (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), the neck (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>), the
middle (<lang n="greek">π</lang>), the left foot (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>), the right foot (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>), the left
hind-foot (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>), the right hind-foot (<lang n="greek">υ</lang>), the tail (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
asked {%Arjuna%} to array the {%Pāṇḍava%} army and slay {%Karṇa%}
(“incapable of being vanquished by…D., As., G., K., and
M.-U.”). The {%Pāṇḍava%} troops were arrayed in the shape
of the half-moon; the left side (<lang n="greek">χ</lang>), the right side (<lang n="greek">ψ</lang>), the
middle (<lang n="greek">ω</lang>), the rear (<lang n="greek">αα</lang>); {%Yudhāmanyu%} and {%Uttamaujas%} became
the protectors of {%Arjuna's%} chariot wheels, and did not quit
him for a moment. Then commenced the battle (VIII, {@11@}).
A fierce slaughter on both sides (description). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ββ</lang>), headed by {%Bhīmasena & Kṣemadhūrti (Kulūtādhi-%}
{%patiḥ%}), who was slain by {%Bhīmasena%}. The {%Kurus%} fled away
(VIII, {@12@}). {%Nakula & Karṇa; Bhīmasena & Aśvatthāman%};
{%Sātyaki%} & the {%Kaikaya%} princes (brothers) {%Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda%};
King {%Citrasena & Śrutakarman; Prativindhya & Citra%};
{%Duryodhana & Yudhiṣṭhira; Arjuna%} & the {%Saṃśaptakas%};
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Kṛpa; Śikhaṇḍin & Kṛtavarman; Śruta-%}
{%kīrti & Śalya; Sahadeva & Duḥśāsana. Anuvinda%} was slain
by {%Sātyaki%}, and so was {%Vinda; Sātyaki%} got upon the chariot
of {%Yudhāmanyu%}, then upon another chariot; the {%Kaikeyas%} fled
(VIII, {@13@}). {%Śrutakarman%} & the {%Abhisāra%} king {%Citrasena%}, whom
he slew and then he pursued his flying troops. {%Prativindhya%}
{%& Citra%}, whom he slew. The {%Kurus%} fled; only {%Aśvatthāman%}
{%& Bhīmasena%} (VIII, {@14@}); Si., Cā., D., and M.-ṛ., applauded
them; both were borne away insensible by their drivers (VIII,
{@15@}). {%Arjuna%} & the {%Saṃśaptakas%}; Si., D.-ṛ., and Cā. applauded
him, etc. {%Aśvatthāman & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa%}), who fought
[Page391-a+ 63]
also the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (VIII, {@16@}); the {%Kaliṅga, Vaṅga%}, and
{%Niṣāda%} heroes attacked {%Arjuna%} with a division of elephants,
which was broken; {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} not to spare
{%Aśvatthāman%}, who at last was borne away by his steeds and
entered the army of {%Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} proceeded
towards the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (VIII, {@17@}). The {%Magadha%} chief
(lord of {%Girivraja%}) {%Daṇḍadhāra%} massacred the {%Pāṇḍava%} army.
{%Arjuna%} (urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%}) & {%Daṇḍadhāra%} (on an elephant),
whom he slew; his brother {%Daṇḍa & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa%}),
who slew him; the hostile force broke up: {%Arjuna%} proceeded
once more against the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (VIII, {@18@}), whom he
slaughtered; {%Ugrāyudha's%} son & {%Arjuna%}, who slew him;
urged by {%Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna%} smote the remnant of the
{%Saṃśaptakas%}, hastening in order to kill {%Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa%}
described the dismal sights of the field of battle “for the
sake of {%Duryodhana%} alone”. The army of {%Duryodhana%} was
defeated by {%Pāṇḍya%} (VIII, {@19@}), who regarded himself as
superior to {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γγ</lang>), and was slaughtering the army
of {%Karṇa%}, the {%Pulindas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δδ</lang>); {%Aśvatthāman & Pāṇḍya (b%}),
who employed the {%Vāyavya%} weapon; mean while {%Karṇa%} began
to rout the elephant force of the {%Pāṇḍavas; Pāṇḍya%} ascended
a riderless elephant and split {%Aśvatthāman's%} diadem; then
{%Aśvatthāman%} slew him, who had given numerous steeds,
men, and elephants as food to the Rā. {%Duryodhana%} and his
brothers worshipped {%Karṇa%} (VIII, {@20@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to
{%Arjuna%} that he did not see {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had
retreated, and {%Karṇa%} was slaying the {%Sṛñjayas%}. The {%Kurus%}
(headed by {%Karṇa%}) & the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (headed by {%Bhīmasena%});
{%Karṇa%} caused a great carnage among the {%Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas%},
and {%Pāñcālas%}. The {%Pāñcāla%} chief, etc. (<lang n="greek">εε</lang>), & {%Karṇa%} (VIII,
{@21@}); {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} & the {%Aṅgas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζζ</lang>); the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
and the {%Pāñcālas%} come to the aid of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Nakula%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ηη</lang>), overloaded the elephants with their weapons; {%Sātyaki%}
killed the elephant of the {%Vaṅga%} king and felled the rider;
{%Sahadeva & Puṇḍra%}, whose elephant he slew, and then
proceeded towards the {%Aṅga%} chief; {%Nakula%} & the {%Aṅga%} king
({%Mleccha%} king), whom he slew; the elephant-men of the
{%Aṅgas + Mekalas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θθ</lang>), & {%Nakula%}; then the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ιι</lang>), rushed to the rescue of {%Nakula; Sahadeva%} slew eight
elephants and {%Nakula%} many; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κκ</lang>),
overloaded the elephants with arrows; the hostile army fled
away and the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors rushed against {%Karṇa%} (VIII,
{@22@}). {%Sahadeva & Duḥśāsana%}, who was taken away by his
charioteer; {%Sahadeva%} crushed {%Duryodhana's%} division (VIII,
{@23@}). {%Karṇa & Nakula%}; both the {%Somakas%} and {%Kurus%} were
greatly afflicted; {%Nakula%} fled on foot; {%Karṇa%} pursued him and
placed his stringed bow around his neck, but let him escape,
recollecting the words of {%Kuntī; Nakula%} in great shame
proceeded towards {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} chariot, which he ascended.
{%Karṇa%} at noon made a great slaughter among the {%Pāñśālas%}
and the {%Sṛñjayas%}, and pursued them (VIII, {@24@}). {%Ulūka &%}
{%Yuyutsu%}, who was vanquished and mounted another chariot.
{%Ulūka%} slaughtered the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Sṛñjayas. Śruta-%}
{%karman (Dhārtarāṣṭra) & Śatānīka%}; both were deprived
of their chariots and retired; {%Śrutakarman%} mounted the
chariot of {%Viviṃśa, Śatānīka%} that of {%Prativindhya. Śakuni &%}
{%Sutasoma%}, who was deprived of his chariot, but contended on
foot with {%Śakuni%}, who fought from his chariot; the Si., etc.,
were highly pleased; {%Sutasoma%} went to the chariot of {%Śrutakīrti%};
{%Śakuni%} slew many of the {%Pāṇḍava%} army (VIII, {@25@}). {%Kṛpa%}
{%& Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, who got bewildered and let his charioteer
carry him to {%Bhīmasena%}, pursued by {%Kṛpa. Kṛtavarman%} (the
{%Bhoja%} king) & {%Śikhaṇḍin%}, who fell into a swoon, and was borne
[Page391-b+ 63]
away by his charioteer; the {%Pāṇḍava%} army fled (VIII, {@26@}).
{%Arjuna%} & the {%Trigartas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λλ</lang>); {%Arjuna%} slew king {%Śatruñ-%}
{%jaya%}, and {%Suśruta's%} son, and {%Candradeva%}; King {%Satyasena%}
wounded {%Kṛṣṇa%} and was slain by {%Arjuna%}, who then slew
{%Citravarman%} and the {%Saṃśaptakas%} in hundreds and thousands,
and {%Mitrasena%}, and wounded {%Suśarman%}; all the {%Saṃśaptakas%}
attacked {%Arjuna%}, who invoked the {%Aindra%} weapon (description);
the hostile army fled away almost entirely (VIII, {@27@}).
{%Duryodhana & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who deprived him of his chariot;
{%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μμ</lang>), rushed to his aid; the other sons of {%Pāṇḍu%}
surrounded {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; the {%Pāñcālas%} & the {%Kauravas%}
(description); {%Karṇa%} slaughtered the {%Pāñcālas, Arjuna%} the
{%Trigartas, Bhīmasena%} the {%Kurus%} and their elephant division,
when the sun had passed the meridian (VIII, {@28@}); {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} (on another chariot) & {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Duryodhana%}
swooned away; {%Bhīmasena%} prevented {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} from
slaying {%Duryodhana; Kṛtavarman & Bhīmasena%} in the after-
noon (VIII, {@29@}). The {%Kurus%} (placing {%Karṇa%} at their van)
& the {%Pāṇḍava%} army (and {%Sātyaki%}); {%Karṇa & Sātyaki%};
many {%Kurus%} came to rescue {%Karṇa%}, but fled away before the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, who were headed by the sons of {%Drupada; Arjuna%}
and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (having said their daily prayers and worshipped
{%Bhava%}) destroyed the {%Kurus; Duryodhana & Arjuna; Arjuna &%}
{%Aśvatthāman + Kṛpa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">νν</lang>); {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξξ</lang>), & {%Karṇa%},
who vanquished them; {%Arjuna & Karṇa%}; many {%Kurus%} fled
away. At the close of the day both armies withdrew; Rā.
and Pś., etc., appeared (VIII, {@30@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} exalted the
prowess of {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek">οο</lang>). The {%Kurus%}, in grief, took counsel of
one another; {%Karṇa%} assured {%Duryodhana%} that he would slay
{%Arjuna%} on the morrow. On the morrow they beheld an
invincible array formed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} according to the
rules of {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Uśanas. Duryodhana%} and his troops
put confidence in {%Karṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} grief (<lang n="greek">ππ</lang>); {%Sañjaya%}
rebuked him by reminding him of his evil acts (<lang n="greek">ρρ</lang>).
At dawn {%Karṇa%} repeated before {%Duryodhana%} his pledge to
slaughter {%Arjuna%}; “my bow {%Vijaya (c%}) is the foremost
of all weapons;…{%Arjuna%} is superior to me only by having
{%Kṛṣṇa%} (‘the Creator of the Universe’) for his charioteer, the
chariot given him by {%Agni%}, his steed, and his standard with
the Ape.” He desired to have {%Śalya%} (“who is superior to
{%Kṛṣṇa%}”) to drive his chariot; {%Duryodhana%} solicited {%Śalya%}
(VIII, {@31@}) to comply with {%Karṇa's%} wishes (<lang n="greek">σσ</lang>); {%Śalya%} took
offence at the proposal (<lang n="greek">ττ</lang>); {%Duryodhana%} repeated his request
in honorific words (<lang n="greek">υυ</lang>), and {%Śalya%} accepted on the condition
that he might in {%Karṇa's%} presence, utter whatever he desired
(<lang n="greek">ϕϕ</lang>) (VIII, {@32@}). § 606: {%Duryodhana%} related to {%Śalya%}
Tripurākhyāna (q.v.), which the great Ṛ. {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} had
narrated to his father. “As {%Brahmán%},…the Supreme
Deity acted as the driver of {%Rudra%}, so do thou restrain the
steeds of {%Karṇa%}” (VIII, {@33@}). He then related a story
of {%Paraśu-Rāma (b%}), which a virtuous brahman had recited in
the presence of his father. {%Rāma%} gave the {%Dhanurveda%} to
{%Karṇa%}, “whom I do not think to have been born in the
{%Sūta%} order, but to be the son of a god, born in the {%Kṣatriya%}
order and abandoned in infancy” (VIII, {@34@}). {%Duryodhana%}
said: “So did {%Brahman%} act as {%Rudra's%} driver; the driver
should be superior to the warrior; thou art selected by us as
superior to {%Karṇa%}.” {%Śalya%} said that many a time he had
heard this history recited to him, and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, knowing the
same, had become the charioteer of {%Arjuna%}, and would fight if
{%Arjuna%} were slain. {%Duryodhana%} eulogized {%Karṇa%} (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) and
then {%Śalya%} (etymology) as superior to {%Kṛṣṇa. Śalya%}
repeated his promise and condition. {%Duryodhana%} embraced
[Page392-a+ 63]
{%Karṇa%}, and, requested by him, once more obtained the promise
of {%Śalya%}, who embraced {%Duryodhana%} and asked their forgiveness
for the words he might speak to {%Karṇa%} for his good; “what
I shall say, in order to inspire thee confidence, is fraught with
self-adulation; I am a driver like {%Mātali%} himself” (VIII, {@35@}).
—§ 607: {%Duryodhana%} said to {%Karṇa%}: “{%Śalya%}, who is superior
to {%Kṛṣṇa%}, will act as a driver, like {%Mātali%} to {%Indra%}.” <is>When</is>
<is>the morning came,</is> {%Duryodhana%} again successfully asked
{%Śalya%} to become {%Karṇa's%} charioteer. {%Karṇa%} having worshipped
the chariot (which had in days of old been sanctified by a priest),
they both ascended it. {%Duryodhana%} once more addressed {%Karṇa%}
(<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Karṇa%} told {%Śalya%} to urge the steeds that he might slay
{%Arjuna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); {%Śalya%} endeavoured to inspire {%Karṇa%} with
fear by eulogizing the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (VIII, {@36@}). When {%Karṇa%}
set out there appeared ill omens. The {%Kuru%} army, however,
was filled with joy. {%Karṇa%} reflected and boasted (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Śalya%}
ridiculed him and praised {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>). {%Karṇa%} proceeded on
his chariot with white steeds and tiger-skins, slaying large
numbers in battle along his way, and inquired after {%Arjuna%}
(VIII, {@37@}), promising every {%Pāṇḍava%} soldier that he
met that unto him who pointed out {%Arjuna%} to him he
would give whatever wealth he desired. {%Duryodhana%} and
the troops rejoiced; {%Śalya%} scornfully laughed, and said
(VIII, {@38@}) that {%Karṇa%} would get to see {%Arjuna%} without
the trouble of seeking him, and asked him to abandon his
desire for a single combat with {%Arjuna. Karṇa%} repeated
his resolution, and {%Śalya%} insulted him in a long speech
(VIII, {@39@}). {%Karṇa%} replied angrily, describing the dis-
reputable practices of the {%Madrakas%} (and the {%Gāndhārakas%}
and {%Sindhu-Sauvīras%}) (VIII, {@40@}). {%Śalya%} answered by praising
himself and his accomplishments as a charioteer (description),
and by reciting the story of the crow and the swan ({%Haṃsa-%}
{%kākīyopākhyāna%}, q.v.): “Even as that crow, fed upon the
remains of the dinners of the {%Vaiśya%} children, disregarded
his equals and superiors, so dost thou, that art fed by the sons
of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} upon the remains of their dishes, disregard
all,” etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>) (VIII, {@41@}). {%Karṇa%} said that {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}
were well known to him, but did not make him afraid.
The curse, however, of {%[Paraśu-]Rāma%} pained him greatly.
He dwelt, disguised as a brahman, with {%Rāma%} in former days,
desirous of obtaining celestial weapons from him. {%Indra%}, as
a worm, began to pierce his thigh, on which was lying the
head of the sleeping {%Rāma%}; therefore he did not move. But
{%Rāma%}, witnessing his patience, discovered that he was not
a brahman, and cursed him, saying that this weapon would
never, in the time of need, when the hour of his death came,
occur to his memory. He had forgotten the weapon, but would,
notwithstanding, slay {%Arjuna%}; he suspected {%Śalya%} of secret
friendship with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; he would employ the {%Brāhma%}
weapon, which {%Arjuna%} would never be able to escape, if only
the wheels of {%Karṇa's%} chariot did not sink into the earth that
day; he would not take fright at {%Yama%} himself with his rod,
or {%Varuṇa%} with his noose, or {%Kubera%} with his mace, or {%Indra%}
with the thunderbolt. “Once upon a time, while wandering
for the sake of practising with my bow {%Vijaya%}, I had
heedlessly struck the calf of a brahman's {%homa%} cow; the
brahman cursed me, saying that my wheel would sink
into the earth in a battle when I was in great danger.
The kings of the Lunar race offered to give that brahman
1,000 kine and 600 bulls, but in vain,” etc. (VIII, {@42@}).
{%Karṇa%} said that it was in vain that {%Śalya%} tried to frighten
him (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>) (VIII, {@43@}). {%Karṇa%} said that in {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} abode
the brahmans used to give accounts of various delightful
[Page392-b+ 63]
regions and many kings of ancient times; an old brahman
had said, blaming the {%Madrakas%} and the {%Bāhīkas%}, that they
should be avoided as being out of the pale of virtue and living
away from {%Himavat%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>), but between Sindhu and its
tributary rivers. On some very secret mission {%Karṇa%} had to
live among the {%Bāhīkas%}, and therefore their conduct was well
known to him; “there is a town {%Śākala%}, a river {%Āpagā%}, and
a {%Bāhīka%} clan {%Jarttikas%}; the practices of these people are
very censurable” (description; an example is cited of a
{%Bāhīka%} who happened to live for some days in {%Kurujāṅgala%},
and a Rā. woman in {%Śākala%}; the rivers {%Śatadru%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), in the countries of the {%Āraṭṭas%}, regions without
virtue and religion). “D., P., and brahmans never accept
gifts from those that are fallen, or those that are
begotten by {%Śūdras%} on the girls of other castes, or the
{%Bāhīkas%}, who never perform sacrifices and are exceedingly
irreligious.” He mentioned three impure places (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>) (v. the
note of PCR., p. 155). There were two {%Piśācas%} in the river
{%Vipāśā%}, named {%Bahi%} and {%Hīka%}; the {%Bāhīkas%} are the offspring
of those two Pś.; they are not creatures created by the
Creator. The {%Kāraṣkaras%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), and other peoples of no
religion one should always avoid; even thus did a Ṛā. woman
speak to a brahman who went to that country for bathing
in sacred water and passed a single night there. The
regions are called {%Āraṭṭāḥ%}, the water {%Bāhīka%}; the lowest
brahmans have resided there from very remote times
({%brāhmaṇāpasadā yatra tulyakālāḥ Prajāpateḥ%}), without the
{%Vedas%}, etc. The {%Prasthalas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>), are almost as blameable
in their practices (VIII, {@44@}). {%Karṇa%} continued his description
of the {%Bāhīkas%} (and {%Gāndhāras%} and {%Madrakas%}). The {%Āraṭṭas%}
had been cursed by a chaste woman. The {%Kauravas%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), know what the eternal religion is. {%Brahmán%}, even in
the {%Kṛta%} age, had censured the practices of the country of
the five rivers. {%K%}. quoted a saying of the Rā. {%Kalmāṣapāda%},
declared by the {%Rākṣasa%} to be the formula for curing a person
possessed by a Rā. or killed by poison. Remarks on the
{%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>), on {%Agni%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>). {%Śalya%} spoke in dis-
paragement of the {%Aṅgas%} (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>). {%Duryodhana%} restored peace
between {%Karṇa%} and {%Śalya%} (VIII, {@45@}).—§ 608: THE SEVEN-
TEENTH DAY'S BATTLE. Beholding the array of the {%Pārthas%}
made by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Karṇa%} proceeded to battle and
assailed {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} inquired about the
disposition of the {%Kuru%} forces (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Sañjaya%} described the
{%Kaurava%} array: right wing (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); on the right of these (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>);
the left side (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>); on their left (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); in the centre at the head
{%Karṇa%} with his sons; in the rear {%Duḥśāsana%}; and behind
him {%Duryodhana%} and his brothers, protected by the united
{%Madrakas%} and {%Kekayas; Aśvatthāman%}, etc., with {%Mlecchas%} on
elephants followed behind. The array was formed according
to the plan of {%Bṛhaspati. Yudhiṣṭhira%}, beholding {%Karṇa%},
spoke to {%Arjuna%} of the hostile array: {%Arjuna%} should proceed
against {%Karṇa; Bhīmasena%} against {%Duryodhana; Nakula%}
against {%Vṛṣasena; Sahadeva%} against {%Śakuni; Śatānīka%} against
{%Duḥśāsana; Sātyaki%} against {%Kṛtavarman; Pāṇḍya%} against
{%Aśvatthāman; Yudhiṣṭhira%} against {%Kṛpa%}; the {%Draupadeyas%}
with {%Śikhaṇḍin%} against the rest of the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, etc.
{%Śalya%} pointed out to {%Karṇa%} the chariot of {%Arjuna (b%}) and
various omens, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); how the {%Saṃśaptakas%} threatened
to slay {%Arjuna%} and the other heroes of the {%Pāṇḍava%} army
(<lang n="greek">η</lang>), and he dissuaded him from trying to slay {%Arjuna%}.
Meanwhile the two armies mingled fiercely in battle (VIII,
{@46@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} about {%Arjuna%}, the {%Saṃ-%}
{%śaptakas%}, and {%Karṇa. Sañjaya%} related: {%Arjuna%} arrayed his
[Page393-a+ 63]
troops, headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (with steeds white as
pigeons); by the side of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} the {%Draupadeyas%}.
{%Arjuna%} & the {%Saṃśaptakas%}. The {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), & the
{%Kurus; Kṛpa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), & the {%Kośalas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>); the battle
became conducive to fame, heaven, and virtue for the
{%kṣatriya, vaiśya%}, and {%śūdra%} heroes that engaged in it.
{%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>) + {%Karṇa%} & the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>);
{%Karṇa%} harassed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; fierce battle between the {%Kurus%}
and the {%Sṛñjayas%} (VIII, {@47@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} inquired about
the particulars of {%Karṇa's%} encounter with {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}.

caused {%Karṇa%} to rally the troops; {%Karṇa%}, employing the

began to lose their senses. The {%Sṛñjayas%} called upon {%Arjuna%}
and {%Vāsudeva. Arjuna%} spoke to {%Kṛṣṇa%} about {%Karṇa%};

head; {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged him to utter his own praises, as self-
praise is equal to self-destruction. {%Arjuna%} praised himself
(<lang n="greek">ρρρ</lang>), and begged for {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} forgiveness, promising to
slay {%Karṇa%} and rescue {%Bhīma. Yudhiṣṭhira%} grieved, saying
that {%Bhīmasena%}, not he, ought to be king. {%Kṛṣṇa%} comforted
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and induced him to forgive both himself and

who said to his charioteer {%Viśoka%} that he was anxious about
{%Arjuna%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; requested by {%Bhīma, Viśoka%} took
an estimate of his weapons. {%Bhīma%} once more addressed
{%Viśoka%}, saying that he would that day slay all the {%Kurus%} or
himself succumb, etc. (<lang n="greek">ψψψ</lang>). {%Viśoka%} pointed out to {%Bhīma%}
that {%Arjuna%} was returning to battle (<lang n="greek">ωωω</lang>). {%Bhīma%} promised
to give {%Viśoka%} fourteen villages, 100 female slaves, and
twenty chariots for this agreeable intelligence (VIII, {@76@}).
{%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīma%} attacked the {%Kaurava%} army with great

encouraged by {%Śalya%} (<lang n="greek">οʹ</lang>). {%Karṇa's%} son {%Vṛṣasena & Bhīma%}
{%+ Nakula%}, who had his white steeds of the {%Vanāyu%} breed
slain by him, and sprang upon {%Bhīma's%} chariot in the sight
of {%Arjuna%}; urged by {%Bhīma%} and {%Nakula, Arjuna%} proceeded
towards {%Vṛṣasena%} (VIII, {@84@}). Eleven warriors (<lang n="greek">πʹ</lang>) + the
{%Kulindas%} (upon elephants, born in {%Himālayan%} regions) &
{%Kṛtavarman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρʹ</lang>); the {%Kulinda%} prince & {%Kṛpa%}, who
slew him; the younger brother of the {%Kulinda%} prince & {%Kṛpa%}
+ the {%Gāndhāra%} king, who slew the {%Kulinda%}; the {%Kurus%} &
the {%Pāṇḍus & Sṛñjayas%}; the {%Bhoja%} chief {%Kṛtavarman &%}
{%Śatānīka; Aśvatthāman%} slew three elephants; the third
brother of the {%Kulinda%} chief & {%Duryodhana%}; the {%Kulinda%},
mounting another elephant, & {%Krātha%}, who was slain;
{%Vṛka%} & the same {%Kulinda%}, whose elephant crushed him; the
son of {%Babhru%} & the same elephant + {%Sahadeva's%} son; {%Babhru%}
fell down; the same {%Kulinda & Śakuni%} (the {%Gāndhāra%} chief),
who slew him; {%Nakula's%} son {%Śatānīka%} (who slew elephants,
etc.) & a {%Kulinda%} warrior [on the {%Kaurava%} side], who was slain
by him; {%Karṇa's%} son {%Vṛṣasena & Śatānīka + Arjuna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">σʹ</lang>);
{%Arjuna%}, informing {%Karṇa%} and all the other {%Kurus%} headed by
{%Duryodhana%} and {%Aśvatthāman%} that he would slay {%Vṛṣasena%}
and then {%Karṇa%}, as {%Bhīma%} would slay {%Duryodhana%}, slew
{%Vṛṣasena; Karṇa & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa%}) (VIII, {@85@}); {%Kṛṣṇa%}
addressed {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek">τʹ</lang>); {%Arjuna's%} reply (<lang n="greek">υʹ</lang>) (VIII, {@86@});
description of {%Arjuna%} and {%Karṇa%} (<lang n="greek">ϕʹ</lang>); all the inhabitants of
the world were heard to differ amongst themselves: D., Dā.,
G., Pś., the Snakes, Rā.; As., {%Yātudhānas%}, Gh., etc., sided
with {%Karṇa%}; the {%Vedas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">χʹ</lang>), with {%Arjuna%}; the smaller
snakes all sided with {%Karṇa%}; V., M., Sā., R., V.-D., A.,
{%Agni%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">χʹ</lang>), sided with {%Arjuna%}, while all Ā. sided with
{%Karṇa%}; the {%Vaiśyas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ψʹ</lang>), sided with {%Karṇa%}; P., etc. (<lang n="greek">χʹ</lang>),
with {%Arjuna%}; the {%Pretas%}, Pś., Rā., etc., with {%Karṇa%}; D.-ṛ.,
B.-ṛ., R.-ṛ. with {%Arjuna%}, as also G. headed by {%Tumburu%}.
With the {%Prādheyas%} and {%Mauneyas%}, G. and Aps., and many
wise sages, having for their vehicles wolves, etc., came in
order to witness the encounter that was also witnessed by
D., Dā., G., N., Y., etc., M.-ṛ., P. (subsisting upon {%svadhā%}),
etc., and {%Brahmán%} with B.-ṛ. and {%Prajāpatis%} and {%Bhava%}.
{%Indra%} wished that {%Arjuna%} should vanquish {%Karṇa; Sūrya%}
that {%Karṇa%} should vanquish {%Arjuna%}. The gods urged
{%Brahmán%} that the success of both should be equal, {%Indra%}
that {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} should win; {%Brahmán%} and {%Iśāna%}
(i.e. Śiva) said that the victory of {%Arjuna%} was certain (<lang n="greek">ωʹ</lang>);
“let {%Karṇa%} obtain identity with V. or M.; let him with
{%Droṇa%} and {%Bhīṣma%} be worshipped in heaven.” {%Indra%}
acquiesced in their words. Description of {%Karṇa's%} and
{%Arjuna's%} chariots. The ape on {%Arjuna's%} banner attacked the
elephant's rope on {%Karṇa's%} banner. {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Śalya%} cast
keen glances at each other, and so did {%Arjuna%} and {%Karṇa%}.
{%Karṇa%} asked {%Śalya%} what he would do if he was slain;
{%Śalya%} said that then he would slay both {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%};
similarly asked by {%Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Karṇa%} could not
slay {%Arjuna%}; if so, the destruction of the universe would be
[Page396-a+ 63]
at hand, and he would himself slay {%Karṇa%} and {%Śalya. Arjuna%}
said that that very day the wives of {%Karṇa%} would become
widows (<lang n="greek">ααʹ</lang>) (VIII, {@87@}). In the welkin D., N., As., Si., Y.,
G., Rā., Aps., B.-ṛ., etc., looked on. The battle commenced.
{%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">αβʹ</lang>), & {%Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa); Arjuna%} defeated
all of them; floral showers fell, etc.; {%Aśvatthāman%} told
{%Duryodhana%} to make peace (<lang n="greek">αγʹ</lang>), but in vain (<lang n="greek">αδʹ</lang>); {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} urged his troops (VIII, {@88@}); description of the battle
between {%Arjuna%} and {%Karṇa; Arjuna%} employed an {%Āgneya%}
weapon, which was quenched by {%Karṇa%} with a {%Vāruṇa%} weapon
by means of clouds, which {%Arjuna%} dispelled by a {%Vāyavya%}
weapon; {%Arjuna%} employed the {%Aindra%} weapon ({%?astraṃ%}
{%dayitaṃ devarājñaḥ), Karṇa%} the {%Bhārgava%} weapon. The
{%Pāñcālas%} and {%Somakas & Karṇa%}, who slew them. Seeing
{%Arjuna's%} weapons baffled by {%Karṇa, Bhīma%} urged {%Arjuna%} to
put forth his strength (<lang n="greek">αεʹ</lang>), and so did {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek">αζʹ</lang>). {%Arjuna%}
bowed to {%Brahmán%} and invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon, which
could be applied by the wind alone; {%Karṇa%} baffled it;
urged by {%Bhīma, Arjuna%} applied a second {%Brāhma%} weapon,
which caused a great carnage among the {%Kaurava%} troops
(description). {%Karṇa & Bhīmasena%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">αηʹ</lang>). {%Arjuna%}
shot at {%Karṇa%} and {%Śalya%}, and slew {%Sabhāpati%}, etc.
The {%Kauravas%} urged {%Karṇa%} to slay {%Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira%}
appeared in order to witness the encounter. {%Arjuna's%} bow-
string broke; {%Karṇa%} took advantage of the interval to hit
{%Arjuna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">αθʹ</lang>). {%Karṇa%} employed as arrows five snakes
that had sided with {%Takṣaka's%} son [i.e. Aśvasena, at
Khāṇḍava]; they penetrated {%Kṛṣṇa's%} body, entered the
earth, and, having bathed [in Bhogavatī], returned to
{%Karṇa%}, but were cut off by {%Arjuna%}, who then covered
{%Karṇa's%} chariot with showers of arrows and slew 2,000
{%Kurus%}, who had been urged by {%Duryodhana%} to fight. The
{%Kurus%} fled, leaving {%Karṇa%} to fight singly with {%Arjuna%} (VIII,
{@89@}). {%Karṇa%} baffled {%Arjuna's%} weapon; {%Karṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}
shot at each other dense showers of arrows. The snake
{%Aśvasena%}, who was hostile to {%Arjuna%}, was passing his time in
the nether region, having escaped from the conflagration at
{%Khāṇḍava%}; recollecting the death of his mother he now soared
up and entered into {%Karṇa's%} quiver in the shape of an arrow.
{%Karṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} were fanned and sprinkled with fragrant
sandal water by many Aps. staying in the welkin, and {%Śakra%}
and {%Sūrya%} with their hands gently brushed their faces. {%Karṇa%}
aimed that arrow, born in {%Airāvata's%} race (i.e. the snake in
the shape of an arrow), which he had long kept for {%Arjuna's%}
destruction, and which lay singly in a golden quiver amid
sandal dust; omens appeared, and the {%Lokapālas%} with {%Śakra%}
raised loud wails. {%Karṇa%} did not know that the snake
{%Aśvasena%} had entered his arrow by the aid of his {%yoga%} powers.
{%Śalya%} in vain exhorted {%Karṇa%} to take another arrow; {%Karṇa%}
said: “{%Karṇa%} never aims an arrow twice; persons like us
never become crooked warriors.” {%Kṛṣṇa%} with his feet
pressed {%Arjuna's%} chariot about a cubit into the earth, and the
snake-arrow, failing to strike off {%Arjuna's%} head, broke his
diadem (made by {%Svayambhū%} for {%Indra > Arjuna%}), incapable
of being crushed by {%Rudra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">αιʹ</lang>). Celestial flowers were
showered upon {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. {%Aśvasena%} appeared to {%Karṇa%}
and asked him to shoot the same weapon again; {%Karṇa%}
refused to avail himself of another's help or shoot the same
shaft twice. {%Aśvasena%} then, of his own accord, rushed on
{%Arjuna%} in the shape of an arrow; {%Kṛṣṇa%} informed {%Arjuna%}
that it was {%Aśvasena%}, who, as an unborn child, was saved with
his mother at {%Khāṇḍava. Arjuna%} cut the snake into pieces,
and {%Krṣṇa%} with his arms raised the chariot from the earth.
[Page396-b+ 63]
Once, when {%Karṇa%} was stupefied and stood inactive, {%Arjuna%}
was disinclined to slay him in such distress, but he was
taught by {%Kṛṣṇa%} never to spare an enemy, however weak.
At that time, when the hour of {%Karṇa's%} death had come,
{%Kāla%}, approaching invisibly, in consequence of the brahman's
wrath, said “the earth is swallowing up thy wheel,” and
the weapon that {%Rāma%} had given him escaped from his
memory, and the earth engulfed his left wheel. {%Karṇa%}
began to rail at righteousness as not always protecting
its worshippers. {%Karṇa%} invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon, and
{%Arjuna%} the {%Aindra%} weapon, which was baffled by {%Karṇa%};
urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%} to “shoot high weapons,” {%Arjuna%} shot the
{%Brāhma%} weapon. {%Karṇa%} cut off, one after another, eleven
bowstrings of {%Arjuna's%}, not knowing that {%Arjuna%} had one
hundred strings to his bow; urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%} to strike
{%Karṇa%} with “superior weapons,” {%Arjuna%} then consecrated
another celestial weapon with {%mantras%}, uniting the {%Raudra%}
weapon with it. At that time the earth swallowed up
one of {%Karṇa's%} wheels. Quickly alighting, {%Karṇa%} seized
his sunken wheel with his two arms and endeavoured to lift
it up; the earth rose up to the height of four fingers breadth,
with her seven islands, etc.; {%Karṇa%} shed tears from wrath and
asked {%Arjuna%} to wait for a moment till he had lifted his sunken
wheel (VIII, {@90@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} taunted {%Karṇa%} for appealing to
virtue and the rules of fair fight by reminding him of all the
wrongs done to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by himself. and {%Duryodhana%}
acting according to his counsels (<lang n="greek">ακʹ</lang>). {%Karṇa%} dropped his
head in shame and gave no answer, and continued to fight.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} to pierce {%Karṇa%} with a celestial weapon;
{%Arjuna%}, remembering the incidents alluded to by {%Kṛṣṇa%},
blazed up with fury; blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate
from all the pores of his body, a sight that appeared
exceedingly wonderful. Both {%Karṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} invoked
the {%Brāhma%} weapon, and {%Karṇa%} once more made an effort to
extricate his chariot. {%Arjuna%} shot an {%Agni%} weapon, quenched
by {%Karṇa%} with a {%Vāruṇa%} weapon, covering all the points of
the compass with darkness, which {%Arjuna%} dispelled with the
{%Vāyavya%} weapon. Pierced by a shaft of {%Karṇa's%}, while the
earth trembled, etc., {%Arjuna%} began to reel, the {%Gāṇḍīva%}
dropped from his hand, etc. At the interval {%Karṇa%} fruitlessly
endeavoured to extricate his chariot. Recovering his senses,
{%Arjuna%} took up an {%añjalika%} weapon. Urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%} to
cut off the head of {%Karṇa, Arjuna%} cut off his standard, and
then, with an {%añjalika%} weapon (the Ṛ. loudly crying out
“peace be to the universe”), struck off {%Karṇa's%} head before
{%Karṇa%} could mount his chariot. A light issued from {%Karṇa's%}
body and entered the Sun. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} rejoiced (<lang n="greek">αλʹ</lang>)
(VIII, {@91@}). {%Duryodhana%}, etc., grieved; {%Bhīma%}, uttering
loud roars, frightened the {%Kauravas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">αμʹ</lang>). {%Śalya%}
informed {%Duryodhana%} of {%Karṇa's%} death (<lang n="greek">ανʹ</lang>). {%Duryodhana%}
became almost deprived of his senses (VIII, {@92@}). Requested
by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} related the state of the {%Kaurava%}
army after {%Karṇa's%} fall (<lang n="greek">αξʹ</lang>). {%Duryodhana%} resolved to make
a final stand (<lang n="greek">αοʹ</lang>). {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (+ four
kinds of forces) & {%Duryodhana%} (+ 25,000 warriors on foot,
who were slain); {%Arjuna%} & the chariot force of the {%Kauravas%};
{%Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">απʹ</lang>), & {%Śakuni%}; the {%Kurus%} fled away; {%Cekitāna%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">αρʹ</lang>), blew their conches. {%Duryodhana%} challenged all the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and fought with them with great valour; he rallied
the remnants of his troops and exhorted them to fight (<lang n="greek">ασʹ</lang>);
they fled away heedless of his words (VIII, {@93@}). {%Śalya%}
described to {%Duryodhana%} the carnage on the field (<lang n="greek">ατʹ</lang>), and
urged the withdrawal of the troops to their nightly quarters.
[Page397-a+ 63]
Having repeatedly comforted {%Duryodhana%}, they retired headed
by {%Aśvatthāman. Karṇa%} did not lose his splendour. D.,
Ṛ., etc., retired. The portents that were seen at {%Karṇa's%}
fall. {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} blew their conches, at which the
{%Kauravas%} left the field, deserting {%Śalya%} and {%Duryodhana%}.
D., G., men, Cā., M.-ṛ., Y., and M.-U. congratulated {%Kṛṣṇa%}
and {%Arjuna%} (VIII, {@94@}). Enumeration of the {%Kauravas%}
retiring from the field (<lang n="greek">αυʹ</lang>). Urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek">αϕʹ</lang>), who
told {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">αχʹ</lang>), to stand there with care,
{%Arjuna%} presented himself to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who, rising from
his bed, greeted {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa%} congratulated
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (<lang n="greek">αψʹ</lang>), who ascribed his success to {%Kṛṣṇa's%}
influence (<lang n="greek">αωʹ</lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%},
came back to the field to have a look at {%Karṇa's%} body. The
kings, filled with joy, approached {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and gladdened
him greatly; so {%Nakula%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">βαʹ</lang>). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and
{%Gāndhārī%} swooned away and were comforted by {%Vidura%},
{%Sañjaya%}, and the {%Kuru%} ladies. The fruits of reciting the
{%Karṇaparvan%}, as also of hearing it recited (VIII, {@96@}): VIII,
{@96@}, 5046.—§ 795{%c%} (Mahābhārata): XVIII, {@6@}, 273.
