{@Araṇyakaparvan@}¦ (“section relating to the forest life of
<div n="lb">the Pāṇḍavas,” the 30th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
<div n="lb">§ 308: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} set out from {%Hāstinapura%} through the
<div n="lb">{%Vardhamāna%} gate with their weapons, accompanied by
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇā,%} in a northerly direction. {%Indrasena%} and other
<div n="lb">servants, 14 in number (see BR. s.v. {%pari;%} Nīl. and PCR.
<div n="lb">take it to be = 15), with their wives, followed them on
<div n="lb">swift cars. The citizens wished to leave the town and
<div n="lb">follow them, but were prevailed upon by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
<div n="lb">return and cherish {%Bhīṣma, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura, Kuntī,%}
<div n="lb">etc. About the close of the day the {%Pāṇḍavas%} reached the
<div n="lb">banian {%Pramāṇa%} on the banks of the {%Gaṅgā,%} purified them-
<div n="lb">selves by touching the water, and passed the night there,
<div n="lb">taking water alone as their sole sustenance, in the company
<div n="lb">of brahmans with and without fire, who had followed them
<div n="lb">(III, {@1@}). When the day broke in, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} tried to
<div n="lb">prevail upon the brahmans to leave him, in order that they
<div n="lb">might not undergo sufferings, living on fruits, roots, and
<div n="lb">deer. But they declared that they would follow him,
<div n="lb">themselves providing their own food.—§ 309: Then
<div n="lb">a learned brahman, {%Śaunaka,%} versed in {%Sāṅkhya%} and {%Yoga,%}
<div n="lb">quoting the ślokas of {%Janaka,%} told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} not only
<div n="lb">to retire from the world, but also in his heart not to mind
<div n="lb">the loss of his wealth. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} declared that it was
<div n="lb">not from avarice, but only because he could no more support
<div n="lb">the brahmans, that he regretted his wealth; “nobody should
<div n="lb">cook his food for himself alone, and nobody should slay an
<div n="lb">animal without devoting it to the gods, the pitṛs, and guests,
<div n="lb">nor should one eat of that food which had not been duly
<div n="lb">dedicated to the gods and the pitṛs.” {%Śaunaka%} said that
<div n="lb">sacrifices, study, gifts, and penance pave the way to the
<div n="lb">world of the {%Pitṛs%}—truth, forgiveness, subduing the senses,
<div n="lb">and renunciation of desire to the heaven of the gods, and
<div n="lb">they should be practised without reference to self {%(abhimāna).%}
<div n="lb">It was by their wealth of {%yoga%} that the {%Rudras, Sādhyas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Ādityas, Vasus,%} and {%Aśvins%} rule over the creatures. So
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who had already achieved success as to his
[Page066-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">indebtedness towards his ancestors and as to sacrifices, now
<div n="lb">ought to seek success in {%yoga%} and in ascetic austerities;
<div n="lb">then he would be able to realize all his wishes (III, {@2@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 310: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then, having consulted {%Dhaumya,%}
<div n="lb">was taught by him (as {%Bhīma, Kārtavīrya, Vainya,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Nahuṣa%} had by ascetic meditation delivered the people from
<div n="lb">affliction) 108 names of {%Sūrya%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), [originally] proclaimed
<div n="lb">by {%Svayambhū%} (i.e. Brahmán)* (the Sun). {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">touching the water of Gaṅgā, with his senses under control,
<div n="lb">and feeding upon air alone, stood engaged in {%prāṇāyāma,%}
<div n="lb">and began a hymn in praise of {%Sūrya (b)%} (the Sun). The
<div n="lb">Sun then showed himself to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and gave him
<div n="lb">a copper vessel, saying that if {%Pāñcālī%} (i.e. {%Kṛṣṇā%}) kept
<div n="lb">this vessel fruits, roots, meat, and vegetables, cooked in
<div n="lb">their kitchen, would be inexhaustible for twelve years.
<div n="lb">Then the god vanished. Rising from the water, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">took hold of {%Dhaumya's%} feet and embraced his brothers.
<div n="lb">The clean food that was dressed, however little, became
<div n="lb">inexhaustible, and only after the brahmans, the brothers,
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and at last {%Kṛṣṇā%} had eaten the day's food
<div n="lb">became exhausted. Having then performed sacrifices, they
<div n="lb">set out for the {%Kāmyaka%} wood, accompanied by {%Dhaumya%}
<div n="lb">and the brahmans (III, {@3@}).—§ 311: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Vidura%} what they should do to secure the good-will of
<div n="lb">the citizens. {%Vidura%} said that he must give back to the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} all that had been theirs, let {%Duryodhana, Śakuni,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Karṇa%} wait upon them, and {%Duḥśāsana%} ask their
<div n="lb">forgiveness in open court, and if {%Duryodhana%} would not
<div n="lb">consent to reign in peace jointly with {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} he
<div n="lb">ought to abandon him and let {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} reign alone.
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} did not approve, and saying “stay or go, as
<div n="lb">thou listest,” he suddenly rose and went away, and {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">went away to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (III, {@4@}).—§ 312: Starting from
<div n="lb">the {%Gaṅgā,%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} went to {%Kurukṣetra,%} performed
<div n="lb">ablutions in the {%Sarasvatī, Dṛśadvatī,%} and {%Yamunā,%} and,
<div n="lb">travelling in a westerly direction, they arrived at the
<div n="lb">{%Kāmyaka%} wood on the {%Sarasvatī.%} There {%Vidura%} came to them
<div n="lb">in a single car. When seeing him, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was afraid
<div n="lb">that he brought an invitation to a new match at dice with
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni%} about their weapons. {%Vidura%} told them that he had
<div n="lb">been forsaken by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and gave them advice how to
<div n="lb">secure adherents (III, {@5@}).—§ 313: After {%Vidura%} had gone
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} repented and fell down senseless, and having
<div n="lb">regained consciousness caused {%Sañjaya%} to bring {%Vidura%} back
<div n="lb">(III, {@6@}). {%Duryodhana,%} being afraid because {%Vidura%} had
<div n="lb">returned, held counsel with {%Śakuni, Karṇa,%} and {%Duḥśāsana,%}
<div n="lb">who were of opinion that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would remain the
<div n="lb">promised space of time in the wood. As {%Duryodhana,%} however,
<div n="lb">was not contented, {%Karṇa%} proposed to set out and slay them.
<div n="lb">When they had gone out {%Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana%} came upon
<div n="lb">them and commanded them to desist, and then appeared
<div n="lb">before {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (III, {@7@}). {%Vyāsa%} warned {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">against permitting {%Duryodhana%} to try to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@8@}).—§ 314: As {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said he was unable to
<div n="lb">cast off his senseless son, {%Vyāsa%} told him: One day, when
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} saw {%Surabhi%} weeping in heaven, and asked her why
<div n="lb">she wept, she told him that one of her offspring (a cow) was
<div n="lb">exceedingly harassed by a husbandman; and although she
<div n="lb">had 1,000 offspring, and her affections flowed equally towards
<div n="lb">all, yet she felt greater compassion for the weak. {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">poured down a shower of rain and caused obstruction to the
<div n="lb">husbandman's work. “So I feel anxious regarding the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} in distress; let thy affections be greater towards
[Page067-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the weak, and let {%Duryodhana%} make peace with them”
<div n="lb">(III, {@9@}).—§ 315: Maitreya-śāpa (q.v.) (III, {@10@}).
