{@[Rājanyamahābhāgya(ṃ)]@}¦ (“the grandeur of the
<div n="lb">kṣatriyas”). § 467 (Mārk.): To the horse-sacrifice of
<div n="lb">king {%Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitri%} all kings repaired, also his brothers
<div n="lb">{%Pratardana, Vasumanas,%} and {%Śibi Auśīnara.%} After the
<div n="lb">sacrifice was completed, these four took {%Nārada%} on their
<div n="lb">chariot and asked him who of them (as they were all blessed
<div n="lb">with long life and virtuous) should first fall from Heaven?
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} answered that {%Aṣṭaka%} should first come down,
<div n="lb">because he had praised himself for having given away
<div n="lb">thousands of kine; then {%Pratardana,%} because he, though
<div n="lb">he had given to {%brahmans%} successively the four horses yoked
<div n="lb">to his chariot, and then had drawn the chariot himself, had
<div n="lb">done so with detraction {%(asūyati);%} then {%Vasumanas,%} because
<div n="lb">he, though he had twice at the {%svastivācana%} for the sake
<div n="lb">of a flowery chariot ({%puṣparathasya,%} v. 13313, see the note
<div n="lb">of PCR., p. 601) given the chariot to {%Nārada,%} because he
<div n="lb">praised it, had not done so on a third occasion; {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">himself would come down before {%Śibi,%} because {%Śibi,%} at the
<div n="lb">request of {%Vidhātṛ%} in the disguise of a {%brahman,%} who was
<div n="lb">desirous of trying {%Śibi,%} had cooked his son {%Bṛhadgarbha%} as
<div n="lb">food for the {%brahman%} without being angry, though the {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">meanwhile had set fire to {%Śibi's%} abode and treasury and
<div n="lb">arsenal, and when the {%brahman%} ordered {%Śibi%} himself to eat
<div n="lb">his son's body {%Śibi%} was willing to do it; but the {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">said, “Thou hast conquered wrath, there is nothing that
<div n="lb">thou canst not give to the {%brahmans,%}” and withdrew his
<div n="lb">hand, and then {%Śibi%} beheld his son like a child of the gods,
<div n="lb">while the {%brahman%} disappeared; and that {%Śibi%} had not done
<div n="lb">this for fame or wealth, etc., but because this is not practised
<div n="lb">by the sinful (III, {@198@}).
