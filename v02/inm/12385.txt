[{@Vṛtra-vadha(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the killing of Vṛtra”): § 693{%b%}
<div n="lb">(Mokṣadh.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of yore, {%Indra,%} accom-
<div n="lb">panied by the celestial forces, proceeded in his chariot, and
<div n="lb">beheld As: {%Vṛtra,%} stationed before him like a mountain,
<div n="lb">500 {%yojanas%} in height and 300 in circumference. {%Indra%} was
<div n="lb">struck with palsy in the lower extremities. On the eve of
<div n="lb">that great battle between D. and As. there arose loud shouts
<div n="lb">from both sides, etc. {%Vṛtra%} felt neither awe nor fear. Then
<div n="lb">the encounter commenced; the entire welkin was enveloped
<div n="lb">by the combatants of both sides; all the gods with {%Brahmán,%}
<div n="lb">and Ṛ., Si., G., and Aps. on their chariots had assembled in
<div n="lb">order to see the battle. {%Vṛtra%} shot rocks, the gods arrows;
<div n="lb">{%Vṛtra%} employed illusion; {%Indra%} was stupefied; {%Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">restored him to his senses by the {%Rathantara,%} pointing out
<div n="lb">to him {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Indra,%} by {%yoga,%} dispelled the
<div n="lb">illusions of {%Vṛtra. Bṛhaspati%} (the son of {%Aṅgiras%}) and Ṛ.
<div n="lb">repaired to {%Śiva,%} whose energy became a fever and penetrated
<div n="lb">{%Vṛtra; Viṣṇu%} entered the thunderbolt of {%Indra; Bṛhaspati,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha,%} and Ṛ. urged {%Indra%} to slay {%Vṛtra,%} and so did {%Śiva,%}
<div n="lb">saying that {%Vṛtra%} was the soul of the universe, capable of
<div n="lb">going everywhere; for 60,000 years {%Vṛtra%} had practised
<div n="lb">penances in order to obtain strength; {%Brahmán%} had given
<div n="lb">him the boons he had solicited: the greatness of {%yogins,%} large
<div n="lb">powers of illusions, excess of might, etc.; {%Śiva%} told {%Indra%} to
<div n="lb">slay him with {%yoga,%} and imparted to him his own energy.
<div n="lb">D. and Ṛ. uttered loud cheers, etc. Suddenly all As. were
<div n="lb">afflicted with the loss of memory; in a trice their powers of
<div n="lb">illusion also disappeared. Ṛ. and D. praised {%Śakra%} and {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@282@}). Description of the symptoms that appeared on
<div n="lb">the body of {%Vṛtra%} when he was overtaken by that fever;
<div n="lb">His memory issued out of his mouth in form of a dreadful
<div n="lb">jackal. Inauspicious omens. {%Indra%} looked hard at him; {%Vṛtra%}
<div n="lb">yawned and uttered superhuman cries; while {%Vṛtra%} was
<div n="lb">yawning {%Indra%} hurled his thunderbolt at him and slew him;
<div n="lb">[XII, {@287,@} 58 ff. = 10,267 ff.: the thunderbolt cut {%Vṛtra%}
<div n="lb">into two halves; {%Vṛtra%} then came to the highest region of
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu,%} for it was by his devotion to {%Viṣṇu%} that he had
<div n="lb">overwhelmed the universe]; then {%Indra%} entered heaven with
<div n="lb">that thunderbolt pervaded by {%Viṣṇu.%} Then {%Brahmavadhyā%}
<div n="lb">(description) issued out of the body of the slain {%Vṛtra.%}
[Page757-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">A little while after, when {%Indra%} was proceeding towards
<div n="lb">heaven, she seized him and stuck to him. {%Indra%} entered the
<div n="lb">fibres of a lotus stalk and dwelt there for many years. But
<div n="lb">{%Brahmavadhyā%} pursued him closely, and deprived him of all
<div n="lb">his energy. At last he repaired to {%Brahmán,%} who made her
<div n="lb">leave {%Indra%} by apportioning one quarter to {%Agni%} (whence it
<div n="lb">should enter him who did not offer oblations of seed, etc. to
<div n="lb">{%Agni%}); one quarter to the trees, herbs, and all kinds of grass
<div n="lb">(whence it should possess the men who would cut or tear any
<div n="lb">of them at {%parvan%}-days); one quarter to the {%Apsarases%}
<div n="lb">(whence it should possess that man who would cohabit
<div n="lb">with women during their courses); and one quarter to the
<div n="lb">waters (whence it should possess that man who would cast
<div n="lb">into the waters phlegm and urine and excrements). With
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán's%} permission {%Indra%} then performed a horse-sacrifice
<div n="lb">and thereby became cleansed, regained his prosperity, and
<div n="lb">slew thousands of foes. From the blood of {%Vṛtra%} were born
<div n="lb">the {%śikhaṇḍāḥ%} (the crests of cocks (?) or name of a plant,
<div n="lb">BR.), which, for this reason, must not be eaten by the twice-
<div n="lb">born classes, etc. Blessing upon the reciter (XII, {@283@}).
