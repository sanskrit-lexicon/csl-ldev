[{@Agniparābhava(h)@}]¦ (“the defeat of Agni”), a part of
<div n="lb">Khāṇḍavadahanaparvan. § 255: I, {@223,@} 8094—8156.
<div n="lb">Questioned by Janamejaya why Agni desired to consume the
<div n="lb">forest of Khāṇḍava, Vaiśampāyana related: It has been heard
<div n="lb">in the Purāṇa that King Śvetaki performed sacrifices so
<div n="lb">incessantly that his ṛtvijes left him, their eyes being afflicted
<div n="lb">with the continued smoke; he then had his sacrifice completed
<div n="lb">by other ṛtvijes. He then desired to perform another sacrifice,
<div n="lb">which should extend over 100 years. But he could not obtain
<div n="lb">any priests to assist him; they told him to apply to Rudra.
<div n="lb">He then went to Kailāsa, and by observing the most rigid
<div n="lb">austerities he prevailed upon Rudra that his sacrifice should be
<div n="lb">completed, on the condition that he could for twelve years
<div n="lb">without intermission pour libations of clarified butter into the
<div n="lb">fire, himself leading all the while the life of a brahmacārin.
<div n="lb">When this had been done Rudra said that he would not
<div n="lb">himself assist at the sacrifice, which properly belonged to
<div n="lb">the brahmans; but he caused Durvāsas {%(b)%} to complete it.
<div n="lb">[When the time came Śvetaki ascended to heaven (Svarga)
<div n="lb">with the ṛtvijes and sadasyas who had helped him in life, B.]
<div n="lb">But Agni became sick, because he had drunk clarified butter
<div n="lb">for twelve years, and applied to Brahmán. Brahmán told
<div n="lb">him to consume the forest of Khāṇḍava, that abode of the
<div n="lb">enemies of the gods, which he had of old once burnt to
<div n="lb">ashes at the request of the gods, together with its living
<div n="lb">population; then he would regain his own nature. Seven
<div n="lb">times Agni, assisted by Vāyu, set the forest on fire; but the
<div n="lb">inhabitants extinguished the fire (the elephants bringing
<div n="lb">water in their trunks, and the Nāgas in their hoods, etc.)
<div n="lb">(I, {@223@}).—§ 256{%a:%} I, {@224,@} 8157—8165{%a.%} Agni again
<div n="lb">applied to Brahmán, who told him to solicit the old deities
<div n="lb">Nara and Nārāyaṇa (now Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa to aid him.
