[{@Agniparābhava(h)@}]¦ (“the defeat of Agni”), a part of
Khāṇḍavadahanaparvan. § 255: I, {@223@}, 8094—8156.
Questioned by Janamejaya why Agni desired to consume the
forest of Khāṇḍava, Vaiśampāyana related: It has been heard
in the <is>Purāṇa</is> that King <is>Śvetaki</is> performed sacrifices so
incessantly that his ṛtvijes left him, their eyes being afflicted
with the continued smoke; he then had his sacrifice completed
by other ṛtvijes. He then desired to perform another sacrifice,
which should extend over 100 years. But he could not obtain
any priests to assist him; they told him to apply to <is>Rudra</is>.
He then went to <is>Kailāsa</is>, and by observing the most rigid
austerities he prevailed upon Rudra that his sacrifice should be
completed, on the condition that he could for twelve years
without intermission pour libations of clarified butter into the
fire, himself leading all the while the life of a brahmacārin.
When this had been done Rudra said that he would not
himself assist at the sacrifice, which properly belonged to
the brahmans; but he caused <is>Durvāsas</is> ({%b%}) to complete it.
[When the time came Śvetaki ascended to heaven (Svarga)
with the ṛtvijes and sadasyas who had helped him in life, B.]
But <is>Agni</is> became sick, because he had drunk clarified butter
for twelve years, and applied to <is>Brahmán</is>. Brahmán told
him to consume the forest of <is>Khāṇḍava</is>, that abode of the
enemies of the gods, which he had of old once burnt to
ashes at the request of the gods, together with its living
population; then he would regain his own nature. Seven
times Agni, assisted by <is>Vāyu</is>, set the forest on fire; but the
inhabitants extinguished the fire (the elephants bringing
water in their trunks, and the Nāgas in their hoods, etc.)
(I, {@223@}).—§ 256{%a%}: I, {@224@}, 8157—8165{%a%}. Agni again
applied to Brahmán, who told him to solicit the old deities
<is>Nara</is> and <is>Nārāyaṇa</is> (now <is>Arjuna</is> and <is>Kṛṣṇa</is> to aid him.
