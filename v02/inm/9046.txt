{@Rāvaṇavadha@}¦ (“the killing of Rāvaṇa”). § 542: {%Rāvaṇa%}
with the {%Rākṣasas%} rushed towards {%Rāma%} and the monkeys
(<lang n="greek">α</lang>); {%Rāvaṇa%} from his body created thousands of {%Rākṣasas%},
whom {%Rāma%} slew with a celestial weapon. Then {%Rāvaṇa%}
produced {%Rākṣasas%}, resembling {%Rāma%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa%}, whom
{%Rāma%} slew. {%Mātali%} came with the chariot of {%Indra, Rāma%}
thought it to be an illusion, but was reassured by {%Vibhīṣaṇa%},
and riding in that chariot he killed {%Rāvaṇa%} with an arrow
which he had consecrated with mantras as a {%Brahmāstra%}.
The gods, the {%Gandharvas, Indra%}, the {%Dānavas%}, the {%Kinnaras%},
and the {%Cāraṇas%} rejoiced (III, {@290@}).
