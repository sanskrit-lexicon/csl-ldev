[{@Drupadaśāsana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the chastising of Drupada”).
<div n="lb">§ 209 (Sambhavap.): {%Droṇa%} now one day asked the {%Dhārta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭras%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} for his fee as their instructor, saying:
<div n="lb">“Seize ye the {%Pāñcāla%} king {%Drupada%} in battle and bring him
<div n="lb">to me.” {%Duryodhana, Karṇa, Yuyutsu, Duḥśāsana, Vikarṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Jalasandha, Sulocana, Subāhu, Dīrghalocana,%} etc., smote the
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas%} and conquered the capital of {%Drupada,%} while {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">etc., waited outside the town at a distance of half a {%krośa,%}
<div n="lb">thinking that the others were not able to seize {%Drupada.%}
<div n="lb">Defeated by {%Drupada,%} they fell back upon the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} bidding {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} not to engage in the fight,
<div n="lb">appointed the sons of {%Mādrī%} his {%cakrarakṣas,%} while {%Bhīmasena,%}
<div n="lb">mace in hand, ran ahead to slay the elephants, while
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} attacked the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%} and felled
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} from his elephant. {%Drupada%} and {%Satyajit%} rushed
<div n="lb">at {%Arjuna. Satyajit%} had his bows repeatedly cut in twain
<div n="lb">and his horses, etc., slain, and desisted from the fight.
[Page271-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} also had his bow cut in twain, etc., by {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">who then took a scimitar and, leaping from his own chariot
<div n="lb">upon that of his foe, seized {%Drupada,%} while the {%Pāñcālas%} ran
<div n="lb">away. {%Bhīma,%} etc., began to lay waste his capital, but were
<div n="lb">prevented by {%Arjuna. Droṇa%} prevailed upon {%Drupada%} to
<div n="lb">accept his friendship, and restored half his kingdom to him, viz.,
<div n="lb">that part of it that lay on the southern side of the {%Bhāgīrathī,%}
<div n="lb">with the southern {%Pāñcālas,%} up to the banks of the {%Carmaṇvatī%}
<div n="lb">river, where {%Drupada%} thenceforth resided sorrowfully in
<div n="lb">{%Kāmpilya%} in {%Mākandī,%} on the banks of {%Gaṅgā,%} while {%Droṇa%}
<div n="lb">(because {%Drupada%} had said that only a king could be the
<div n="lb">friend of a king) retained that half that lay to the north of the
<div n="lb">{%Bhāgīrathī,%} and thenceforth continued to reside in {%Ahicchatra%}
<div n="lb">(I, {@138@}).
