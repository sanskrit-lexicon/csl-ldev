{@Śyenakapotīya(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating to the hawk
and the pigeon”). § 11 (Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2@}, 448 ({%°m%}
{%upākhyānam%}).—§ 411 (Plakṣāv.): {%Indra%} in the shape of
a hawk and {%Agni%} in that of a pigeon in fear of the hawk
came to test king {%Uśīnara's%} merit (III, {@130@}). {%Uśīnara%}
in vain offered the hawk another beast, and thereafter his
kingdom, in order that he might spare the pigeon (“he
who slays a {%brahman%}, he who slaughters a cow, the
common mother of all the worlds, and he who forsakes
one asking for protection, are equally sinful”); at last
the hawk agreed upon receiving the pigeon's weight of
{%Uśīnara's%} flesh; {%Uśīnara%} cut portion after portion of his
flesh and placed it in the balance, and as it did not out-
weigh the pigeon he mounted the scale himself, utterly
devoid of flesh. Then {%Indra%} said: “As long as man shall
speak of thee, so long…thou shalt inhabit the holy
regions.” Saying this {%Indra%} ascended to heaven, and so did
king {%Uśīnara%} in a radiant shape, after having filled heaven
and earth with his merits (III, {@131@}).
