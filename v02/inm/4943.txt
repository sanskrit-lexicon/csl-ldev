{@[Jvarotpatti(ḥ)]@}¦ (“the origin of fever”). § 694{%b%}
(Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of yore there was
a summit of {%Meru%}, named {%Jyotiṣka%}, belonging to {%Savitṛ%}
({%Sāvitraṃ%}). There {%Śiva%} used to sit with {%Pārvatī%}, waited
upon by D., V., etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). After some time the {%Prajāpati%}
{%Dakṣa%} commenced to perform a sacrifice, whither all the
gods headed by {%Indra%}, with the permission of {%Śiva%}, repaired
mounted on their chariots, proceeding to that spot whence the
{%Gaṅgā%} is said to issue. {%Pārvatī%} asked why {%Śiva%} did not
himself proceed thither, and was told that in days of yore
the deities made an arrangement in consequence of which no
share was assigned to {%Śiva%} of offerings in sacrifices. He
was filled with grief. {%Śiva%} ordered {%Nandin%} to wait there,
and summoning all his {%yoga%} force, he, with all his terrible
followers, came and destroyed that sacrifice (description);
it assumed the form of a deer and tried to fly away through
the skies, pursued by {%Śiva%} with bow and arrow. A drop of
sweat fell from his forehead down on the earth; there
appeared a terrible fire, whence issued a dreadful being of
very short stature, etc. (description), who consumed the
embodied form of sacrifice and then attacked D. and Ṛ., who
fled in all directions. The earth began to tremble, etc.
{%Brahmán%} appeased {%Śiva%} by promising him a share of the
sacrificial offerings; the being that had sprung from his
sweat should be distributed among all creatures as fever
(description of the distribution). Blessing upon the reader
(XII, {@284@}).
