{@[Jvarotpatti(ḥ)]@}¦ (“the origin of fever”). § 694{%b%}
<div n="lb">(Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of yore there was
<div n="lb">a summit of {%Meru,%} named {%Jyotiṣka,%} belonging to {%Savitṛ%}
<div n="lb">{%(Sāvitraṃ).%} There {%Śiva%} used to sit with {%Pārvatī,%} waited
<div n="lb">upon by D., V., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). After some time the {%Prajāpati%}
<div n="lb">{%Dakṣa%} commenced to perform a sacrifice, whither all the
<div n="lb">gods headed by {%Indra,%} with the permission of {%Śiva,%} repaired
<div n="lb">mounted on their chariots, proceeding to that spot whence the
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā%} is said to issue. {%Pārvatī%} asked why {%Śiva%} did not
<div n="lb">himself proceed thither, and was told that in days of yore
<div n="lb">the deities made an arrangement in consequence of which no
<div n="lb">share was assigned to {%Śiva%} of offerings in sacrifices. He
<div n="lb">was filled with grief. {%Śiva%} ordered {%Nandin%} to wait there,
<div n="lb">and summoning all his {%yoga%} force, he, with all his terrible
<div n="lb">followers, came and destroyed that sacrifice (description);
<div n="lb">it assumed the form of a deer and tried to fly away through
<div n="lb">the skies, pursued by {%Śiva%} with bow and arrow. A drop of
<div n="lb">sweat fell from his forehead down on the earth; there
<div n="lb">appeared a terrible fire, whence issued a dreadful being of
<div n="lb">very short stature, etc. (description), who consumed the
<div n="lb">embodied form of sacrifice and then attacked D. and Ṛ., who
<div n="lb">fled in all directions. The earth began to tremble, etc.
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} appeased {%Śiva%} by promising him a share of the
<div n="lb">sacrificial offerings; the being that had sprung from his
<div n="lb">sweat should be distributed among all creatures as fever
<div n="lb">(description of the distribution). Blessing upon the reader
<div n="lb">(XII, {@284@}).
