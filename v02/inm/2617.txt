{@Śiśupālavadhaparvan@}¦ (“of the killing of Śiśupāla,” the
27th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr., cf. {%Śiśupālavadha%}).
§ 290: As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was afraid that his sacrifice might
be obstructed, {%Bhīṣma%} consoled him, saying that {%Kṛṣṇa%}
was invincible (II, {@40@}). {%Śiśupāla%} again censured {%Bhīṣma%}
and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and compared {%Bhīṣma%} to the old swan, who
always preached of virtue, so that the other birds gave him
food and kept their eggs with him; but the old swan used to
eat up their eggs, till he was found out and slain (II, {@41@}).
{%Śiśupāla%} censured {%Kṛṣṇa's%} behaviour towards {%Jarāsandha%};
{%Bhīma%} rushed up in anger, but was restrained by {%Bhīṣma%},
while {%Śiśupāla%} was boasting (II, {@42@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said:
{%Śiśupāla%} was born with three eyes and four hands, and
brayed like an ass; his parents resolved to abandon him,
but were prevented by an incorporeal voice who foreboded
that that man in whose lap the child would be sitting,
when its superfluous arms would fall down and the third eye
on its forehead disappear, should be its slayer. Though the
child was placed upon the laps of 1,000 kings, this came not
to pass until {%Rāma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} went to the capital of the
{%Cedis%} to see their father's sister (the mother of {%Śiśupāla%}),
when the boy was placed on the lap of {%Kṛṣṇa%}; then the
arms fell down and the eye disappeared. {%Kṛṣṇa%} granted to
{%Śiśupāla's%} mother the boon that he would pardon 100 offences
of {%Śiśupāla's%} (II, {@43@}). {%Bhīṣma%} declared that {%Kṛṣṇa%} himself
had wanted to provoke the boast of {%Śiśupāla. Śiśupāla%}
reproached {%Bhīṣma%} because he did not rather praise the other
kings ({%a%}), such as the {%Bālhika%} king {%Darada (b%}), or {%Karṇa (c%}),
etc.; he compared {%Bhīṣma%} to the bird {%Bhūliṅga (d). Bhīṣma%}
expressed his contempt for such talk. The kings became
angry and proposed to kill {%Bhīṣma%}, who relied upon {%Kṛṣṇa%}
(II, {@44@}).—§ 291: {%Śiśupāla%} challenged {%Kṛṣṇa%}, being
desirous to slay him with all the {%Pāṇḍavas. Kṛṣṇa%} related
({%a%}) how {%Śiśupāla%}, hearing that the {%Sātvatas%} had gone to
{%Prāgjyotiṣa%}, came and burnt {%Dvārakā; (b%}) that when king
{%Bhoja%} was sporting on the {%Raivataka%} hill, he fell upon his
attendants and slew many of them and led many away in
[Page201-b+ 63]
chains to his own city; ({%c%}) in order to obstruct the sacrifice of
{%Kṛṣṇa's%} father, he stole the sacrificial horse that had been let
loose under the guard of armed men; ({%d%}) that he ravished
the reluctant wife of {%Babhru%} on her way from {%Hāstinapura%}
(so Nīl.) to the {%Sauvīras; (e%}) that disguising himself in the
attire of the {%Kārūṣa%} king, he had ravished {%Bhadrā Vaiśālī%}
(i.e. daughter of the king of {%Viśālā%}, Nīl.); ({%f%}) that he had
desired {%Rukmiṇī%}, but failed to obtain her; ({%g%}) that he ({%Kṛṣṇa%})
had promised to pardon him 100 times, and that the number
had now become full. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then thought of his discus,
which came into his hand; therewith he instantly cut off the
head of {%Śiśupāla%}; the kings beheld a fiery energy issuing
out of the body of {%Śiśupāla%} and entering {%Kṛṣṇa's%} body;
the sky, though cloudless, poured showers of rain, etc.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused his brothers to perform the funeral rites
of {%Śiśupāla%}, the son of {%Damaghoṣa%}; then he, with all the
kings, installed the son of {%Śiśupāla%} in the sovereignty of the
{%Cedis%}.—§ 292, v. Rājasūyikaparvan.
