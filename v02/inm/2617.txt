{@Śiśupālavadhaparvan@}¦ (“of the killing of Śiśupāla,” the
<div n="lb">27th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr., cf. {%Śiśupālavadha%}).
<div n="lb">§ 290: As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was afraid that his sacrifice might
<div n="lb">be obstructed, {%Bhīṣma%} consoled him, saying that {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">was invincible (II, {@40@}). {%Śiśupāla%} again censured {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and compared {%Bhīṣma%} to the old swan, who
<div n="lb">always preached of virtue, so that the other birds gave him
<div n="lb">food and kept their eggs with him; but the old swan used to
<div n="lb">eat up their eggs, till he was found out and slain (II, {@41@}).
<div n="lb">{%Śiśupāla%} censured {%Kṛṣṇa's%} behaviour towards {%Jarāsandha;%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} rushed up in anger, but was restrained by {%Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">while {%Śiśupāla%} was boasting (II, {@42@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Śiśupāla%} was born with three eyes and four hands, and
<div n="lb">brayed like an ass; his parents resolved to abandon him,
<div n="lb">but were prevented by an incorporeal voice who foreboded
<div n="lb">that that man in whose lap the child would be sitting,
<div n="lb">when its superfluous arms would fall down and the third eye
<div n="lb">on its forehead disappear, should be its slayer. Though the
<div n="lb">child was placed upon the laps of 1,000 kings, this came not
<div n="lb">to pass until {%Rāma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} went to the capital of the
<div n="lb">{%Cedis%} to see their father's sister (the mother of {%Śiśupāla%}),
<div n="lb">when the boy was placed on the lap of {%Kṛṣṇa;%} then the
<div n="lb">arms fell down and the eye disappeared. {%Kṛṣṇa%} granted to
<div n="lb">{%Śiśupāla's%} mother the boon that he would pardon 100 offences
<div n="lb">of {%Śiśupāla's%} (II, {@43@}). {%Bhīṣma%} declared that {%Kṛṣṇa%} himself
<div n="lb">had wanted to provoke the boast of {%Śiśupāla. Śiśupāla%}
<div n="lb">reproached {%Bhīṣma%} because he did not rather praise the other
<div n="lb">kings ({%a%}), such as the {%Bālhika%} king {%Darada (b),%} or {%Karṇa (c),%}
<div n="lb">etc.; he compared {%Bhīṣma%} to the bird {%Bhūliṅga (d). Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">expressed his contempt for such talk. The kings became
<div n="lb">angry and proposed to kill {%Bhīṣma,%} who relied upon {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">(II, {@44@}).—§ 291: {%Śiśupāla%} challenged {%Kṛṣṇa,%} being
<div n="lb">desirous to slay him with all the {%Pāṇḍavas. Kṛṣṇa%} related
<div n="lb">{%(a)%} how {%Śiśupāla,%} hearing that the {%Sātvatas%} had gone to
<div n="lb">{%Prāgjyotiṣa,%} came and burnt {%Dvārakā; (b)%} that when king
<div n="lb">{%Bhoja%} was sporting on the {%Raivataka%} hill, he fell upon his
<div n="lb">attendants and slew many of them and led many away in
[Page201-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">chains to his own city; {%(c)%} in order to obstruct the sacrifice of
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa's%} father, he stole the sacrificial horse that had been let
<div n="lb">loose under the guard of armed men; {%(d)%} that he ravished
<div n="lb">the reluctant wife of {%Babhru%} on her way from {%Hāstinapura%}
<div n="lb">(so Nīl.) to the {%Sauvīras; (e)%} that disguising himself in the
<div n="lb">attire of the {%Kārūṣa%} king, he had ravished {%Bhadrā Vaiśālī%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. daughter of the king of {%Viśālā,%} Nīl.); {%(f)%} that he had
<div n="lb">desired {%Rukmiṇī,%} but failed to obtain her; {%(g)%} that he {%(Kṛṣṇa)%}
<div n="lb">had promised to pardon him 100 times, and that the number
<div n="lb">had now become full. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then thought of his discus,
<div n="lb">which came into his hand; therewith he instantly cut off the
<div n="lb">head of {%Śiśupāla;%} the kings beheld a fiery energy issuing
<div n="lb">out of the body of {%Śiśupāla%} and entering {%Kṛṣṇa's%} body;
<div n="lb">the sky, though cloudless, poured showers of rain, etc.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused his brothers to perform the funeral rites
<div n="lb">of {%Śiśupāla,%} the son of {%Damaghoṣa;%} then he, with all the
<div n="lb">kings, installed the son of {%Śiśupāla%} in the sovereignty of the
<div n="lb">{%Cedis.%}—§ 292, v. Rājasūyikaparvan.
