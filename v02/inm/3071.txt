{@Dambhodbhavopākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating
<div n="lb">to Dambhodbhava”). (Cf. Dambhodbhavasya ākhyānaṃ.)
<div n="lb">§ 563 (Bhagavady.): There was a king of yore named
<div n="lb">{%Dambhodbhava,%} who was at the head of the earth; his
<div n="lb">sovereignty extended over the whole world. Every morning
<div n="lb">he used to ask if there were anyone superior or even equal to
<div n="lb">himself. Certain brahmans counselled him to curb his pride;
<div n="lb">and as he continued to ask the brahmans the same question
<div n="lb">day after day, some high-souled brahmans mentioned to him
<div n="lb">the ascetics {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa,%} “who have taken their birth
<div n="lb">in the race of men, and are now practising penances on
<div n="lb">{%Gandhamādana.%}” The king marched to the spot with a large
<div n="lb">army, and found them emaciated with hunger and thirst, etc.
<div n="lb">He desired a battle with them. The {%Ṛṣis%} declined; but as
<div n="lb">he repeatedly summoned them to fight, {%Nara%} took up a
<div n="lb">handful of grass-blades, and therewith baffled all their arrows
<div n="lb">and cut off the eyes and ears and noses of the warriors. The
<div n="lb">king fell at the feet of the {%Ṛṣis%} and said, “Let me be blessed.”
<div n="lb">{%Nara%} then told him to be obedient to the {%brahmans%} and be
<div n="lb">virtuous. The king returned to his city, and from that time
<div n="lb">began to practise righteousness.
