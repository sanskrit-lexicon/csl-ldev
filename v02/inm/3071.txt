{@Dambhodbhavopākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating
to Dambhodbhava”). (Cf. Dambhodbhavasya ākhyānaṃ.)
§ 563 (Bhagavady.): There was a king of yore named
{%Dambhodbhava%}, who was at the head of the earth; his
sovereignty extended over the whole world. Every morning
he used to ask if there were anyone superior or even equal to
himself. Certain brahmans counselled him to curb his pride;
and as he continued to ask the brahmans the same question
day after day, some high-souled brahmans mentioned to him
the ascetics {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}, “who have taken their birth
in the race of men, and are now practising penances on
{%Gandhamādana%}.” The king marched to the spot with a large
army, and found them emaciated with hunger and thirst, etc.
He desired a battle with them. The {%Ṛṣis%} declined; but as
he repeatedly summoned them to fight, {%Nara%} took up a
handful of grass-blades, and therewith baffled all their arrows
and cut off the eyes and ears and noses of the warriors. The
king fell at the feet of the {%Ṛṣis%} and said, “Let me be blessed.”
{%Nara%} then told him to be obedient to the {%brahmans%} and be
virtuous. The king returned to his city, and from that time
began to practise righteousness.
