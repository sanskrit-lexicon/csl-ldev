[{@Sañjayayānaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating to
<div n="lb">the mission of Sañjaya,” the 58th of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of Mhbhr.; cf. Sañjayayāna). § 556: {%Drupada's purohita%}
<div n="lb">was honoured by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bhīṣma,%} and {%Vidura.%} He
<div n="lb">mentioned the eternal duties of kings; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had not
<div n="lb">obtained their share of the paternal wealth; the murderous
<div n="lb">contrivances of the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras;%} the deceitful game; the
<div n="lb">indignities in the council-hall; the exile for thirteen years;
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} desired nothing but a peaceful settlement; the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} were more powerful; men like {%Sātyaki, Bhīmasena,%}
[Page618-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">and the twins were equal in might to 1,000 {%akṣauhiṇīs;%}
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} nobody could fight (V, {@20@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">approved of his speech; but {%Karṇa%} wrathfully interrupted
<div n="lb">him. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} pacified {%Bhīṣma,%} rebuked {%Karṇa,%} sent
<div n="lb">{%Drupada's purohita%} back to the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and summoned
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} to the council-hall (V, {@21@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} gave
<div n="lb">instructions to {%Sañjaya,%} praising the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">and some of their adherents (<lang n="greek"></lang>), mentioning the killing of
<div n="lb">{%Śiśupāla (b),%} blaming {%Duryodhana,%} and {%Karṇa,%} and ordered
<div n="lb">him to go to {%Upaplavya%} to salute them and the five sons
<div n="lb">of {%Draupadī,%} and tell them that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was desirous
<div n="lb">of peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (V, {@22@}). {%Sañjaya%} came to
<div n="lb">{%Upaplavya%} and saluted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and enquired about
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and mentioned the prowess of {%Arjuna (c),%}
<div n="lb">{%Sahadeva (d), Nakula (e),%} and the {%Ghoṣayātrā%} (V, {@23@}).
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} delivered his message and answered {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
<div n="lb">questions (V, {@24@}). In the presence of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} greeted {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and recommended
<div n="lb">peace, “for what, in sooth, is life after having killed all your
<div n="lb">kinsfolk?”; he mentioned {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) on the side of
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), on the side of the
<div n="lb">{%Kauravas%} (V, {@25@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that peace was
<div n="lb">preferable to war, but complained that {%Duryodhana%} had
<div n="lb">disregarded the words of {%Vidura,%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had been
<div n="lb">desirous solely of satisfying his sons; that {%Duryodhana's%}
<div n="lb">counsellors were now {%Duḥśāsana, Śakuni,%} and {%Karṇa.%} He
<div n="lb">compared {%Arjuna, Bhīma, Nakula,%} and {%Sahadeva%} with {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Duryodhana.%} He claimed {%Indraprastha%} for his kingdom
<div n="lb">(V, {@26@}). {%Sañjaya%} declared that if, without war, the {%Kurus%}
<div n="lb">would not yield his share to {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} then it would
<div n="lb">be far better for him to live upon alms in the kingdom of
<div n="lb">the {%Andhakas%} and the {%Vṛṣṇis%} than to obtain sovereignty by
<div n="lb">war (V, {@27@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that virtue and vice, which
<div n="lb">are both eternal and absolute, exchange their aspects during
<div n="lb">seasons of distress; he would not seek even what belongs to
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpati,%} or heaven, or {%Brahmaloka (Prājāpatyaṃ tridivaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%Brahmalokaṃ)%} by unrighteous means; but he would be
<div n="lb">guided by {%Kṛṣṇa,%} as did {%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%} was the
<div n="lb">great judge of the propriety or otherwise of all acts (V, {@28@}).
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said he wished prosperity for both the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra;%} therefore he desired peace; but when
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and his sons were so covetous, war was
<div n="lb">inevitable; “some say that work should be shunned and
<div n="lb">that salvation is attainable by knowledge; but the brahmans
<div n="lb">know this, that though one may have a knowledge of eatable
<div n="lb">things, yet the hunger will not be appeased unless one actually
<div n="lb">eats; such branches of knowledge as are of use in doing
<div n="lb">works bear fruit, but not the other ones. In the other world
<div n="lb">it is by virtue of work that the gods, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) flourish.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} is constantly engaged in the study of the {%Veda;%}
<div n="lb">he is bent on the horse-sacrifice and the {%rājasūya;%} he
<div n="lb">rides horses and elephants, etc.; if the {%Pāṇḍavas%} could see
<div n="lb">a course of action not involving the slaughter of the sons of
<div n="lb">{%Kuru,%} they would adopt it. But we must take into con-
<div n="lb">sideration the division into four castes and the respective
<div n="lb">duties allotted to each (specification). War and weapons
<div n="lb">were invented by {%Indra%} for putting the {%Dasyus%} to death.”
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} alluded to the game and the role of {%Śakuni%} there,
<div n="lb">to the indignities undergone by {%Kṛṣṇā%} from {%Duḥśāsana%} and
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} while the {%Kurus%} with {%Bhīṣma%} at their head did not
<div n="lb">interfere, and only {%Vidura%} took her part; and that {%Duḥśāsana%}
<div n="lb">had called the {%Pāṇḍaras%} eunuchs at their departure. He
[Page618-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">would go in person to the {%Kurus.%} He compared the evil
<div n="lb">passions of {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), with the righteousness of
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “King {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with his sons
<div n="lb">constitute a forest, while the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are its tigers; do not
<div n="lb">cut down the forest with its tigers, and let not the tigers be
<div n="lb">driven away from the forest; the tiger out of the wood
<div n="lb">is easily slain; the wood also that is without a tiger is easily
<div n="lb">cut down.” Similarly the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} are as creepers,
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are {%Śāla-%} trees, and the creepers cannot dis-
<div n="lb">pense with a large tree round which it can twine (V, {@29@}).
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} then bade farewell to {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} spoke approvingly of {%Sañjaya's%} agreeable
<div n="lb">speech and excellent conduct as an ambassador, and com-
<div n="lb">pared him to {%Vidura,%} and declared him to be as dear to them
<div n="lb">as {%Dhanañjaya%} (i.e. Arjuna). He recommended the {%brahmans%}
<div n="lb">to him, and told him to salute {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the
<div n="lb">aged, middle-aged, and young ladies, “the daughters of our
<div n="lb">house,” and the maidservants and manservants, and the
<div n="lb">many humpbacked and lame ones among them, and those
<div n="lb">that were defective in limb, or imbecile, and the dwarfs
<div n="lb">to whom {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} gave food and raiment from motives
<div n="lb">of humanity, the blind, the aged, the many that had the use
<div n="lb">only of their hands, being destitute of legs, the masterless
<div n="lb">and weak, those that vainly strived to earn a living, the
<div n="lb">ignorant, in fact, all those that were in pitiable circum-
<div n="lb">stances, all the ambassadors arrived from all sides, etc. He
<div n="lb">concluded with this message to {%Duryodhana:%} “give me back
<div n="lb">my own {%Indraprastha (Śakrapurīṃ),%} or fight with me”
<div n="lb">(V, {@30@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that the Creator {%(Dhātṛ)%} gives
<div n="lb">and takes according to his will. He told {%Sañjaya%} especially
<div n="lb">to salute {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bhīṣma,%} and {%Vidura,%} and recommend
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to them, that they might counsel peace; and
<div n="lb">to say to {%Duryodhana%} that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were willing to forgive
<div n="lb">his insults to {%Draupadī (Kṛṣṇā)%} and {%Duḥśāsana's%} dragging
<div n="lb">her, disregarding {%Kuntī;%} but they must have their proper
<div n="lb">share of the kingdom; “give us even a single province of the
<div n="lb">empire; give us even {%Kuśasthala%} (B. {%Avi°%}), {%Vṛkasthala, Mākandī,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vāraṇāvata,%} and in the fifth place any other village that
<div n="lb">thou likest; even this will end the quarrel.” He said that
<div n="lb">to see the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāñśālas%} live happily united was
<div n="lb">what he desired (V, {@31@}). Having returned to {%Hāstinapura,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} addressed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} at night; he praised
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} “who shines in his natural perfection, leaving
<div n="lb">his load of sins to be borne by thee,” while {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
<div n="lb">acts were contrary to both religion and profit. In delivering
<div n="lb">the message from {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} he did not mention the
<div n="lb">alternative of giving them the five villages. He alluded to
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna's%} ascending to the very heavens and being honoured
<div n="lb">there. King {%Bali,%} not finding a primary cause {%(pāraṃ),%}
<div n="lb">regarded time {%(kālaḥ)%} to be the cause of everything.
<div n="lb">“To-morrow morning the {%Kurus,%} assembled together in the
<div n="lb">council-hall, will hear the words of {%Ajātaśatru%} (i.e. {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%})” (V, {@32@}).
