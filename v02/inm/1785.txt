{@Brahmasabhāvarṇana(ṃ)@}¦ (“description of the palace
of Brahmán”). § 270 (Lokapālas.): In the {%Kṛta%} age, {%Āditya%}
(= the Sun) having seen the {%sabhā%} of {%Pitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}),
which is immeasurable and immaterial ({%mānasī%}), told {%Nārada%},
who also desired to see it, to perform a {%Brahmavrata%} for
1,000 years. {%Nārada%}, then, having repaired to {%Himavat%},
performed the penance, and then he was taken by {%Sūrya%}
(the Sun) to the {%sabhā%} of {%Brahmán%}. Within a moment it
assumes a different form, and cannot be described. It is
neither cold nor warm, without hunger or thirst, etc.; it
is not supported by columns; it is eternal, etc. There
{%Sarvalokapitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}) is sitting, himself alone
incessantly creating by means of his divine illusion ({%deva-%}
{%māyayā%}), surrounded by the {%prajānāṃ patayaḥ%} (enumeration),
etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) (II, {@11@}).
