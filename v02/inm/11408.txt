[{@Vaivāhikaparvan@}<sup>1</sup>]¦ (“the section relating to the
marriage of Draupadī with the Pāṇḍavas”, the 13th of the
minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Vaivāhika.) § 237.
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} related what had happened: ({%Arjuna%} had
large red eyes, v. 7175, and {%Kṛṣṇā%} had followed him, catching
hold of his deerskin. v. 7177); from their conversation on
[Page704-a+ 63]
military subjects, he concluded that they were the {%Pāṇḍavas%},
of whom it had been heard that they had all escaped from
the lac-house. {%Drupada%} (= {%Saumaki%}, v. 7198) sent his
{%purohita%} to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who said that there was no occasion
for {%Drupada%} to grieve for his daughter. While {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
was saying this, another messenger from {%Drupada%} announced
that the feast was ready (I, {@193@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%}, with
{%Kuntī%} and {%Kṛṣṇā%} were conveyed to {%Drupada's%} palace.
{%Drupada%} wished to ascertain to which caste they belonged,
and had for that purpose made ready a large collection of
various articles appertaining to different human occupations;
after dinner they began to observe, with interest, the imple-
ments of war, wherefore {%Drupada%} and his son thought that
they were of royal blood (I, {@194@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told
{%Drupada%} who they were. {%Drupada%} vowed to restore {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} to his kingdom. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told him that they
would all marry {%Kṛṣṇā%}, which {%Drupada%} considered to be
contrary to morality. While they discoursed on this matter
{%Vyāsa%} arrived (I, {@195@}). {%Drupada%} consulted {%Vyāsa%} about
the wedding of his daughter. {%Vyāsa%} desired to hear the
opinion of each of them. {%Drupada%} regarded the practice
of marrying one wife to five men as sinful, and so did
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Yudhiṣṭhira%} thought it not to be sinful,
because his heart, that never inclined to what was sinful,
approved of it; “it is recorded in the {%Purāṇa%} that {%Jaṭilā%}
{%Gautamī%} had married seven {%ṛṣis%}, and a {%muni's%} daughter, born
of a tree ({%Vārkṣī%} [= {%Māriṣā%}, BR.], see Hariv., v. 96 foll.)
married the ten {%Pracetases%}”; moreover, their mother {%Kuntī%}
had told them to enjoy her all. {%Kuntī%} was afraid that she
would be guilty of a lie. {%Vyāsa%} said that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was
right, and took {%Drupada%} apart (I, {@196@}) and related to him
{%Pañcendropākhyāna%} (§§ 238—239).—§ 240. {%Drupada%} then
consented, as it had been ordained by the gods. {%Vyāsa%}
declared that very day to be auspicious as the moon entered
in conjunction with {%Puṣya (Pauṣyaṃ yogam upaiti%}).
{%Drupada%} and his son made preparations for the wedding, and
{%Dhaumya%}, performing the usual rites, married {%Kṛṣṇā%} to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and then to his brothers on successive
days. {%Draupadī%} regained her virginity every day after
her previous marriage. Then {%Drupada%} gave to them various
kinds of excellent wealth (I, {@198@}). {%Drupada%}, after his
alliance with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, had all his fears dispelled. His
ladies worshipped the feet of {%Kunitī. Kuntī%} pronounced a
blessing upon {%Kṛṣṇā. Kṛṣṇa%} sent them costly presents
(I, {@199@}).
