[{@Sudarśanopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Sudarśana”). § 720{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said:
{%Prajāpati Manu > Ikṣvāku >%} 100 sons; the tenth of those,
{%Daśāśva%}, became the king of {%Māhiṣmatī; Daśāśva's%} son was
the pious {%Madirāśva > Dyutimat > Suvīra > Sudurjaya >%} R-ṛ
{%Duryodhana%}, in whose kingdom there was no miser, etc., and
who was learned in the {%Vedas%} and {%Vedānta. Duryodhana%}
begat the beautiful {%Sudarśanā%} upon the river {%Narmadā%};
{%Agni%}, taking the shape of a brahman, demanded her hand from
the king, who would not give her to him; then {%Agni%} vanished
from his great sacrifice. {%Duryodhana%} repaired to the
brahmans, who became informed of the matter by {%Agni%};
then the king consented, and {%Agni%} gave, as a marriage-
dower, the boon to the king that he would always remain
there, and {%Agni%} has always been present there to this day,
and was seen by {%Sahadeva%} on his digvijaya. She bore to
{%Agni%} the beautiful {%Sudarśana%}, who, even in his childhood,
knew {%Bráhman. Sudarśana%} married {%Oghavatī%}, the daughter
of king {%Oghavat%} and the sister of {%Ogharatha%}, and dwelt in
{%Kurukṣetra%}; he took the vow of conquering death by leading
the life of a householder. He instructed {%Oghavatī%} that, for
pleasing a guest, she must not spare even her own person.
One day, when {%Sudarśana%} went out to fetch firewood,
a graceful brahman came to {%Oghavatī%} and required and
obtained her own person. {%Mṛtyu%}, with his iron club, was
always at the side of {%Sudarśana%}, watching him in order to
find out his flaws. When {%Sudarśana%} came home he showed
no anger. The brahman turned out to be {%Dharma%}, who was
pleased with {%Sudarśana%}, and said: “you have conquered
{%Mṛtyu%}”; {%Oghavatī%} has been protected from defilement by
your virtue and by her own chastity; you will attain to all
the worlds in this your body, and, as {%yoga%} is in the control of
{%Oghavatī%}, she will follow you with half her corporeal self,
being with the other half [the river] {%Oghavatī%}. Then {%Indra%}
came, riding in a fine chariot, and approached that brahman.
