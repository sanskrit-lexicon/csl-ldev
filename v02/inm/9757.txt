[{@Satyavatīlābhopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
<div n="lb">how Śāntanu got Satyavatī”). § 165 (cf. Āpavop.):
<div n="lb">Description of {%Śāntanu,%} the princes anointed him as “King of
<div n="lb">Kings” ({%rājarājya,%} v. 3974); he ruled the earth from {%Hāsti-%}
<div n="lb">{%napura,%} the town {%(puṭabhedana)%} of the {%Kurus%} (v. 3978);
<div n="lb">there was no killing of deer, boars, etc., under his reign
<div n="lb">(cf. § 162!) except for the sacrifices to the gods, {%ṛṣis,%}
<div n="lb">and {%pitṛs.%} For thirty-six years he, without enjoying the
<div n="lb">love of women, roamed about in the woods, and his son,
<div n="lb">{%Gāṅgeya Devarata,%} the {%Vasu,%} was equal to him. One day,
<div n="lb">when pursuing a deer he had wounded along the banks of the
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā,%} he saw a youth who, with a heavenly weapon, checked
<div n="lb">the flow of the {%Gaṅgā.%} It was his son who, knowing him, but
<div n="lb">not known by him, and clouding his perception by illusion
<div n="lb">{%(māyā),%} suddenly disappeared. On {%Śāntanu's%} prayer, {%Gangā%}
<div n="lb">appeared holding the boy, and having told him that he was
<div n="lb">his son, and that he had studied all the {%Vedas%} and their {%Aṅgas%}
<div n="lb">with {%Vasiṣṭha%} and knew all {%śāstras%} that were known by
<div n="lb">{%Uśanas%} and {%Bṛhaspati%} (adored by the gods and {%Asuras%}), and
<div n="lb">by the {%ṛṣi Rāma Jāmadagnya,%} and also the {%rājadharmas,%} she
<div n="lb">let him take him to his capital, where he was installed as
<div n="lb">heir-apparent. After four years {%Śāntanu%} met with {%Satyavatī%}
<div n="lb">in the wood on the banks of {%Yamunā,%} and demanded her hand
<div n="lb">from her father, the king of the fishermen {%(dāśarāja),%} who
<div n="lb">would not consent unless {%Śāntanu%} would promise that his son
<div n="lb">by {%Satyavatī%} should become his successor on the throne.
<div n="lb">{%Śāntanu%} would not grant the boon, but returned to {%Hāsti-%}
<div n="lb">{%napura%} and passed his time in sorrow until {%Devavrata,%} having
<div n="lb">learned from the old minister the cause of his grief, by
<div n="lb">declaring that he would adopt the vow of {%brahmacarya%}
<div n="lb">(including celibacy), prevailed upon the fisherman (who had
<div n="lb">formerly rejected the {%Devarṣi Asita,%} because {%Parāśara%} had
<div n="lb">pointed out to him {%Śāntanu%} as a suitable husband for her),
<div n="lb">that he gave {%Satyavatī%} to {%Śāntanu,%} while the gods and {%ṛṣis%}
<div n="lb">showered flowers upon {%Devavrata,%} calling him {%Bhīṣma.%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} then took the maiden to {%Hāstinapura%} on his chariot,
<div n="lb">and {%Śāntanu%} bestowed upon him the boon of death at choice
<div n="lb">(I, {@100@}). (For continuation v. Citrāṅgadop.)
