{@[Pāṇḍu-digvijaya(ḥ)]@}¦ (“subjection of the earth by
Pāṇḍu”). § 177 (Sambhavap.): After some time {%Bhīṣma%}
went to the capital of the {%Madra%} king {%Śalya%} (“the bull of
the {%Bāhlīkas%}”), and according to the custom observed in
that family and ordained by {%Svayambhū%} himself, he obtained
his sister {%Mādrī%} for {%Pāṇḍu%} by giving great riches, and took
her to {%Hāstinapura%}, where the nuptials were celebrated on an
auspicious day and {%muhūrta%}. After thirty days {%Pāṇḍu%} started
on his conquest of the world, and conquered the {%Daśārṇas%}
({%āgaskṛtaḥ%}), slew the {%Magadha%} king {%Dīrgha%} (who had offended
against numerous kings) in {%Rājagṛha%}; then going into {%Mithilā%}
he defeated the {%Videhas%}; then the {%Kāśis, Suhmas%}, and {%Puṇḍras%},
etc., and after having made all kings the vassals of the {%Kurus%},
he returned laden with much wealth to {%Hāstinapura%}, where
people said: “They who before robbed the {%Kurus%} of both
territory and wealth, have been made to pay tribute” by
{%Pāṇḍu%} (I, {@113@}).
