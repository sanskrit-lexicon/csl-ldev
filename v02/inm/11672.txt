Ādivaṃśāvataraṇa). Instructed by {%Indra%} king {%V%}. won the
kingdom of the {%Cedis%}. Some time after he dwelled in a
hermitage practising austerities, from which the gods,
headed by {%Indra%}, prevailed upon him to refrain. {%Indra%}
gave him a crystal {%vimāna%} (chariot) capable of carrying him
through the air like a god, and a triumphal ({%vaijayantī%})
garland named {%Indramālā%}, and a bamboo pole to protect the
peaceful. After a year the king planted this pole in the
ground in order to worship {%Indra%} (from that time all
kings plant a bamboo pole, and the next day they cover it
with golden clothes, etc.). {%Indra%} came there in the form of
a swan to accept the worship, and blessed the men and kings
who would observe this festivity: I, {@63@}, 2335 ({%Paurava-%}

{%Māvella%}, and {%Yadu%}; they founded kingdoms and towns, named
after themselves, and created separate dynasties which lasted

called {%Uparicara%}. Near his capital flowed the river {%Śuktimatī%},
and from love of this river the mountain Kolāhala once barred
its course. {%V%}. then kicked the mountain with his foot, and
the river gave him the two children which she had with
{%Kolāhala. V%}. made the male child the commander of his
armies, and made the daughter {%Girikā%} his wife: I, {@63@},
2368, 2370.—§ 76 (Matsya): I, {@63@}, 2371 ({%°oḥ patnī…%}
