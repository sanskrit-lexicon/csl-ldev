{@Uttaṅka@}¦ (so B., C. mostly Uta°), a ṛṣi. § 11 (Parvasangr.):
I, {@2@}, 364.—§ 17 (cf. Pauṣyap.): {%U%}. was the disciple of
{%Veda%}; having resisted the temptations of the wife of {%Veda%}, he
obtained leave to depart, but first wished to bring {%Veda%} some
gratuity for his instruction, and having uttered this wish two
times, he was ordered to procure the ear-rings of {%Pauṣya's%}
queen for the wife of {%Veda%}. Having met with a bull
({%Airāvata%}) and a man ({%Indra%}) mounted upon it, he ate of the
dung and drank of the urine ({%amṛta%}) of that bull, “as his
master had formerly done.” Coming to the abode of {%Pauṣya%},
he could not discover the queen before he had purified himself
properly from the leavings of his last meal. He and {%Pauṣya%}
cursed one another. Having obtained the ear-rings, {%U%}. returned
to his master. On the road {%Takṣaka%}, the king of the
serpents, in the shape of a mendicant, stole the ear-rings and
proceeded to {%Nāgaloka. Indra%}, with the thunderbolt, made
a hole through which {%U%}. entered the {%Nāgaloka%}, where he
hymned the serpents. He there saw two damsels (= {%Dhātṛ%}
and {%Vidhātṛ%}) sitting over a loom, weaving a fabric with black
and white threads (night and day), further, he saw a wheel
(= the year) with twelve spokes (= the months) turned by
six boys (= the seasons), and then a man ({%Parjanya%}) mounted
on a horse ({%Agni%}). At the injunction of the man {%U%}. blew
into the anus of the horse, whence there issued flames of fire
with smoke, which were about to consume the {%Nāgaloka%}.
[Page696-b+ 63]
{%Takṣaka%} then gave back the ear-rings and {%U%}. was borne by
the horse to his master's abode. His master explained to
him all he had seen during his journey. {%U%}. then proceeded
to {%Hāstinapura%} and told {%Janamejaya%}, who had some time before
returned victorious from {%Takṣaśilā%}, to burn {%Takṣaka%}, who
had bitten {%Parikṣit%} to death, and caused {%Kāśyapa%} to turn
back without relieving {%Parikṣit%}, at a snake-sacrifice: I, {@3@},

13524, (13525); {@203@}, 13546, 13550 ({%U%}. urged Bṛhadaśva
to slay Dhundhu, but Bṛhadaśva directed him to Kuvalāśva).

({%U%}. accompanied Kuvalāśva when he set out to slay Dhundhu).
—§ 784{%b%} (Anugītāp.): When {%Kṛṣṇa%}, on his way from
{%Hāstinapura%} to {%Dvārakā%}, had entered the desert, he beheld
{%U.%}, who enquired whether he came after having reconciled
the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas. Kṛṣṇa%} told him the matter;
filled with wrath {%U%}. threatened to curse him; {%Kṛṣṇa%} warned
{%U%}. (who had practised {%brahmacarya%} from the day of his
infancy) against destroying his penances [by a curse] (XIV,
{@53@}). {%U%}. agreed that {%Kṛṣṇa%} should first tell him “that
faultless adhyātma”, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} explained his own identity
with the creator and destroyer of all things. “R., V.,
Dai., Y., G., Rā., N., and Aps. have sprung from me; etc.
{%Dharma%}, whose essence is compassion for all creatures, is my
eldest-born offspring, and has sprung from my mind; I am
{%Viṣṇu, Brahmán%}, and {%Śakra%} (i.e. Indra).” He always acts
as those beings in whose order he lives (XIV, {@54@}). {%U%}. pre-
vailed upon {%Kṛṣṇa%} to show him his eternal {%Vaiṣṇava%} or
universal form, and praised {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who granted him the
boon to have water wherever he wished for it (water
being scarce in such deserts) by thinking of {%Kṛṣṇa%}. Once,
when {%U%}. was wandering thirsty in the desert, and thought of
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, he saw a naked {%Cāṇḍāla (mātaṅga%}) all besmeared with
dirt, surrounded by a pack of dogs, and carrying a sword,
and bow, and arrows; from his urinary organs there issued
copious streams of water; he invited {%U%}. to accept this water;
{%U%}. refused and even censured {%Kṛṣṇa%}, the {%Cāṇḍāla%} dis-
appeared. {%Kṛṣṇa%} came and said that the {%Cāṇḍāla%} was
{%Indra%}, whom he had ordered to give {%amṛta%} to {%U%}. in the form
of water, and that {%Indra%} at first had refused to do it, but at
last had agreed on the condition that {%U%}. should accept it in
that way. {%Kṛṣṇa%} ordained that on those days in which {%U%}.
would feel a desire for water, there should rise clouds raining
savoury water over this desert and that they should be named
{%U%}.-clouds; even to this day such clouds shower rain on the
arid desert (XIV, {@55@}): Asked by {%Janamejaya%} about the
penances of {%U., Vaiśampāyana%} related that {%U.'s%} preceptor
{%Gautama%}, having permitted thousands of disciples to return
home, was so pleased with the devotion of {%U%}. that he would
not dismiss him, even after 100 years, and decrepitude over-
took {%U.%}; one day when he threw the load of fuel he had
fetched on the earth, one of his matted locks, white as silver,
[Page697-a+ 63]
had become entangled with the load and fell on the earth;
beholding that sign of old age, {%U%}. gave himself up to loud
lamentations; the beautiful daughter of his preceptor, at the
command of her father, sought to hold the tears of {%U%}. in her
hands, but her hands seemed to burn with the dropping tears,
and she was obliged to let them fall on the earth; the earth
was unable to hold them. Asked by {%Gautama, U%}. explained
the matter. {%Gautama%} permitted him to leave him; as {%U%}.
spoke of the fee, {%Gautama%} said that he was already highly
gratified and that if {%U%}. became a young man of sixteen years,
he would give him his daughter in marriage. {%U%}. again
became a youth and accepted the maiden. As he spoke of
the fee to his preceptor's wife, {%Ahalyā%} said that she was
already gratified. {%U.%}, however, insisted, and {%Ahalyā%} then
commanded him to bring her the celestial ear-rings which
were borne by the wife of {%Saudāsa%}, who had [through the
curse of {%Śaktri%}] become a cannibal. {%Gautama%} blamed
{%Ahalyā%} that she had sent {%U%}. to the cannibal. {%Ahalyā%} said
that she had done it unknowingly, and that {%Gautama%} would
protect {%U. U%}. met {%Saudāsa%} in a deserted forest (XIV, {@56@}).
{%Saudāsa%} was of frightful mien, wearing a long beard smeared
with human blood, and looking like a second {%Yama%}; he
congratulated himself that he had met {%U%}. at the sixth hour of
the day when he was in search of food; {%U%}. maintained that
while one is employed for the sake of his preceptor, one
should not be injured; at last they agreed that when he had
brought his preceptor the ear-rings he should come back;
{%Saudāsa%} told {%U%}. to go and see the queen {%Madayantī%} (near a
forest fountain), as he could not himself see her at the sixth
hour. {%Madayantī%} told {%U%}. to bring her some sign from her
husband, as these ear-rings, when placed on the earth, would
be stolen by the {%Nāgas%}, if worn by one who is impure from
eating, they would be taken away by the {%Yakṣas%}, and if the
wearer fell asleep, the gods would take them away; “also
the {%maharṣis%} and the {%Rākṣasas%} watch for opportunities for
carrying them away; they always produce gold and shine
brightly at night; they protect against hunger, and thirst,
and fear, and he who wears them grows in size” (XIV, {@57@}).
{%U%}. came back to {%Saudāsa%}, who gave him a sign. When he
had got the ear-rings, {%U%}. once more came back to {%Saudāsa%},
and asked him about the meaning of the mystic words he had
caused him to say to {%Madayantī%}, as a sign. {%Saudāsa%}, referring
to his own terrible condition in consequence of his being
cursed [by {%Śaktri%}], said that he hoped that this gift to a
brahman might save him. {%U%}. asked {%Saudāsa%} to give him
such advice as is approved by the wise: “is it proper for
me to come back to thee or not?” {%Saudāsa%} said that he
would then tell him never to come back. When {%U.%}, on his
way to {%Ahalyā%}, having bound the ear-rings in the folds of his
black deerskin, had proceeded for some distance he became
afflicted with hunger and climbed a {%bilva%}-tree (ægle marmelos),
hanging his deerskin on a branch, while he plucked some
fruits. Struck by some fruits the deerskin fell down, the
knot was untied, and a serpent of {%Airāvata's%} race carried
the ear-rings, holding them in his mouth, into an anthill.
Filled with wrath, {%U%}. with his staff, pierced that anthill for
thirty-five days, desirous of making a path to the nether
regions; the goddess Earth became anxious; {%Indra%} came
there in the disguise of a brahman afflicted with the sorrow
of {%U.%}, and told him that the regions of the {%Nāgas%} are
thousands of {%yojanas%} distant; as {%U%}. did not desist, {%Indra%}
united the latter's staff with his thunderbolt, and struck
with the thunderbolt, the earth opened a way to the {%Nāgaloka%}
[Page697-b+ 63]
({%c). U%}. entered the {%Nāgaloka%}, very cheerless; then there
appeared to him a black steed with a white tail, whose face
and eyes were of coppery hue. He told {%U%}. to blow into his
anus, “which thou often didst at the retreat of {%Gautama%} in
former days”; the horse turned out to be Agni; {%U%}. did as
he was directed, a thick smoke enveloped the {%Nāgaloka%}, the
{%Nāgas%}, headed by {%Vāsuki%}, gave {%U%}. the ear-rings, which he
brought to {%Ahalyā%} (XIV, {@58@}): XIV, {@53@}, 1542 ({%muniśreṣ-%}
