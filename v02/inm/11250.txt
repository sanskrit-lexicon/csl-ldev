{@Uttaṅka@}¦ (so B., C. mostly Uta°), a ṛṣi. § 11 (Parvasangr.):
<div n="lb">I, {@2,@} 364.—§ 17 (cf. Pauṣyap.): {%U.%} was the disciple of
<div n="lb">{%Veda;%} having resisted the temptations of the wife of {%Veda,%} he
<div n="lb">obtained leave to depart, but first wished to bring {%Veda%} some
<div n="lb">gratuity for his instruction, and having uttered this wish two
<div n="lb">times, he was ordered to procure the ear-rings of {%Pauṣya's%}
<div n="lb">queen for the wife of {%Veda.%} Having met with a bull
<div n="lb">{%(Airāvata)%} and a man {%(Indra)%} mounted upon it, he ate of the
<div n="lb">dung and drank of the urine {%(amṛta)%} of that bull, “as his
<div n="lb">master had formerly done.” Coming to the abode of {%Pauṣya,%}
<div n="lb">he could not discover the queen before he had purified himself
<div n="lb">properly from the leavings of his last meal. He and {%Pauṣya%}
<div n="lb">cursed one another. Having obtained the ear-rings, {%U.%} returned
<div n="lb">to his master. On the road {%Takṣaka,%} the king of the
<div n="lb">serpents, in the shape of a mendicant, stole the ear-rings and
<div n="lb">proceeded to {%Nāgaloka. Indra,%} with the thunderbolt, made
<div n="lb">a hole through which {%U.%} entered the {%Nāgaloka,%} where he
<div n="lb">hymned the serpents. He there saw two damsels (= {%Dhātṛ%}
<div n="lb">and {%Vidhātṛ%}) sitting over a loom, weaving a fabric with black
<div n="lb">and white threads (night and day), further, he saw a wheel
<div n="lb">(= the year) with twelve spokes (= the months) turned by
<div n="lb">six boys (= the seasons), and then a man {%(Parjanya)%} mounted
<div n="lb">on a horse {%(Agni).%} At the injunction of the man {%U.%} blew
<div n="lb">into the anus of the horse, whence there issued flames of fire
<div n="lb">with smoke, which were about to consume the {%Nāgaloka.%}
[Page696-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Takṣaka%} then gave back the ear-rings and {%U.%} was borne by
<div n="lb">the horse to his master's abode. His master explained to
<div n="lb">him all he had seen during his journey. {%U.%} then proceeded
<div n="lb">to {%Hāstinapura%} and told {%Janamejaya,%} who had some time before
<div n="lb">returned victorious from {%Takṣaśilā,%} to burn {%Takṣaka,%} who
<div n="lb">had bitten {%Parikṣit%} to death, and caused {%Kāśyapa%} to turn
<div n="lb">back without relieving {%Parikṣit,%} at a snake-sacrifice: I, {@3,@}

<div n="lb">—§ 784{%b%} (Anugītāp.): When {%Kṛṣṇa,%} on his way from
<div n="lb">{%Hāstinapura%} to {%Dvārakā,%} had entered the desert, he beheld
<div n="lb">{%U.,%} who enquired whether he came after having reconciled
<div n="lb">the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas. Kṛṣṇa%} told him the matter;
<div n="lb">filled with wrath {%U.%} threatened to curse him; {%Kṛṣṇa%} warned
<div n="lb">{%U.%} (who had practised {%brahmacarya%} from the day of his
<div n="lb">infancy) against destroying his penances [by a curse] (XIV,
<div n="lb">{@53@}). {%U.%} agreed that {%Kṛṣṇa%} should first tell him “that
<div n="lb">faultless adhyātma”, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} explained his own identity
<div n="lb">with the creator and destroyer of all things. “R., V.,
<div n="lb">Dai., Y., G., Rā., N., and Aps. have sprung from me; etc.
<div n="lb">{%Dharma,%} whose essence is compassion for all creatures, is my
<div n="lb">eldest-born offspring, and has sprung from my mind; I am
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu, Brahmán,%} and {%Śakra%} (i.e. Indra).” He always acts
<div n="lb">as those beings in whose order he lives (XIV, {@54@}). {%U.%} pre-
<div n="lb">vailed upon {%Kṛṣṇa%} to show him his eternal {%Vaiṣṇava%} or
<div n="lb">universal form, and praised {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who granted him the
<div n="lb">boon to have water wherever he wished for it (water
<div n="lb">being scarce in such deserts) by thinking of {%Kṛṣṇa.%} Once,
<div n="lb">when {%U.%} was wandering thirsty in the desert, and thought of
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa,%} he saw a naked {%Cāṇḍāla (mātaṅga)%} all besmeared with
<div n="lb">dirt, surrounded by a pack of dogs, and carrying a sword,
<div n="lb">and bow, and arrows; from his urinary organs there issued
<div n="lb">copious streams of water; he invited {%U.%} to accept this water;
<div n="lb">{%U.%} refused and even censured {%Kṛṣṇa,%} the {%Cāṇḍāla%} dis-
<div n="lb">appeared. {%Kṛṣṇa%} came and said that the {%Cāṇḍāla%} was
<div n="lb">{%Indra,%} whom he had ordered to give {%amṛta%} to {%U.%} in the form
<div n="lb">of water, and that {%Indra%} at first had refused to do it, but at
<div n="lb">last had agreed on the condition that {%U.%} should accept it in
<div n="lb">that way. {%Kṛṣṇa%} ordained that on those days in which {%U.%}
<div n="lb">would feel a desire for water, there should rise clouds raining
<div n="lb">savoury water over this desert and that they should be named
<div n="lb">{%U.%}-clouds; even to this day such clouds shower rain on the
<div n="lb">arid desert (XIV, {@55@}): Asked by {%Janamejaya%} about the
<div n="lb">penances of {%U., Vaiśampāyana%} related that {%U.'s%} preceptor
<div n="lb">{%Gautama,%} having permitted thousands of disciples to return
<div n="lb">home, was so pleased with the devotion of {%U.%} that he would
<div n="lb">not dismiss him, even after 100 years, and decrepitude over-
<div n="lb">took {%U.;%} one day when he threw the load of fuel he had
<div n="lb">fetched on the earth, one of his matted locks, white as silver,
[Page697-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">had become entangled with the load and fell on the earth;
<div n="lb">beholding that sign of old age, {%U.%} gave himself up to loud
<div n="lb">lamentations; the beautiful daughter of his preceptor, at the
<div n="lb">command of her father, sought to hold the tears of {%U.%} in her
<div n="lb">hands, but her hands seemed to burn with the dropping tears,
<div n="lb">and she was obliged to let them fall on the earth; the earth
<div n="lb">was unable to hold them. Asked by {%Gautama, U.%} explained
<div n="lb">the matter. {%Gautama%} permitted him to leave him; as {%U.%}
<div n="lb">spoke of the fee, {%Gautama%} said that he was already highly
<div n="lb">gratified and that if {%U.%} became a young man of sixteen years,
<div n="lb">he would give him his daughter in marriage. {%U.%} again
<div n="lb">became a youth and accepted the maiden. As he spoke of
<div n="lb">the fee to his preceptor's wife, {%Ahalyā%} said that she was
<div n="lb">already gratified. {%U.,%} however, insisted, and {%Ahalyā%} then
<div n="lb">commanded him to bring her the celestial ear-rings which
<div n="lb">were borne by the wife of {%Saudāsa,%} who had [through the
<div n="lb">curse of {%Śaktri%}] become a cannibal. {%Gautama%} blamed
<div n="lb">{%Ahalyā%} that she had sent {%U.%} to the cannibal. {%Ahalyā%} said
<div n="lb">that she had done it unknowingly, and that {%Gautama%} would
<div n="lb">protect {%U. U.%} met {%Saudāsa%} in a deserted forest (XIV, {@56@}).
<div n="lb">{%Saudāsa%} was of frightful mien, wearing a long beard smeared
<div n="lb">with human blood, and looking like a second {%Yama;%} he
<div n="lb">congratulated himself that he had met {%U.%} at the sixth hour of
<div n="lb">the day when he was in search of food; {%U.%} maintained that
<div n="lb">while one is employed for the sake of his preceptor, one
<div n="lb">should not be injured; at last they agreed that when he had
<div n="lb">brought his preceptor the ear-rings he should come back;
<div n="lb">{%Saudāsa%} told {%U.%} to go and see the queen {%Madayantī%} (near a
<div n="lb">forest fountain), as he could not himself see her at the sixth
<div n="lb">hour. {%Madayantī%} told {%U.%} to bring her some sign from her
<div n="lb">husband, as these ear-rings, when placed on the earth, would
<div n="lb">be stolen by the {%Nāgas,%} if worn by one who is impure from
<div n="lb">eating, they would be taken away by the {%Yakṣas,%} and if the
<div n="lb">wearer fell asleep, the gods would take them away; “also
<div n="lb">the {%maharṣis%} and the {%Rākṣasas%} watch for opportunities for
<div n="lb">carrying them away; they always produce gold and shine
<div n="lb">brightly at night; they protect against hunger, and thirst,
<div n="lb">and fear, and he who wears them grows in size” (XIV, {@57@}).
<div n="lb">{%U.%} came back to {%Saudāsa,%} who gave him a sign. When he
<div n="lb">had got the ear-rings, {%U.%} once more came back to {%Saudāsa,%}
<div n="lb">and asked him about the meaning of the mystic words he had
<div n="lb">caused him to say to {%Madayantī,%} as a sign. {%Saudāsa,%} referring
<div n="lb">to his own terrible condition in consequence of his being
<div n="lb">cursed [by {%Śaktri%}], said that he hoped that this gift to a
<div n="lb">brahman might save him. {%U.%} asked {%Saudāsa%} to give him
<div n="lb">such advice as is approved by the wise: “is it proper for
<div n="lb">me to come back to thee or not?” {%Saudāsa%} said that he
<div n="lb">would then tell him never to come back. When {%U.,%} on his
<div n="lb">way to {%Ahalyā,%} having bound the ear-rings in the folds of his
<div n="lb">black deerskin, had proceeded for some distance he became
<div n="lb">afflicted with hunger and climbed a {%bilva%}-tree (ægle marmelos),
<div n="lb">hanging his deerskin on a branch, while he plucked some
<div n="lb">fruits. Struck by some fruits the deerskin fell down, the
<div n="lb">knot was untied, and a serpent of {%Airāvata's%} race carried
<div n="lb">the ear-rings, holding them in his mouth, into an anthill.
<div n="lb">Filled with wrath, {%U.%} with his staff, pierced that anthill for
<div n="lb">thirty-five days, desirous of making a path to the nether
<div n="lb">regions; the goddess Earth became anxious; {%Indra%} came
<div n="lb">there in the disguise of a brahman afflicted with the sorrow
<div n="lb">of {%U.,%} and told him that the regions of the {%Nāgas%} are
<div n="lb">thousands of {%yojanas%} distant; as {%U.%} did not desist, {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">united the latter's staff with his thunderbolt, and struck
<div n="lb">with the thunderbolt, the earth opened a way to the {%Nāgaloka%}
[Page697-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%(c). U.%} entered the {%Nāgaloka,%} very cheerless; then there
<div n="lb">appeared to him a black steed with a white tail, whose face
<div n="lb">and eyes were of coppery hue. He told {%U.%} to blow into his
<div n="lb">anus, “which thou often didst at the retreat of {%Gautama%} in
<div n="lb">former days”; the horse turned out to be Agni; {%U.%} did as
<div n="lb">he was directed, a thick smoke enveloped the {%Nāgaloka,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Nāgas,%} headed by {%Vāsuki,%} gave {%U.%} the ear-rings, which he
<div n="lb">brought to {%Ahalyā%} (XIV, {@58@}): XIV, {@53,@} 1542 {%(muniśreṣ-%}
