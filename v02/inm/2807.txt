{@Śukābhipatana(ṃ)@}¦ (“the flying about” of Śuka): XII,
<div n="lb">{@332—334@} (12557—12649) (continued from {%Śuka-Nārada-%}
<div n="lb">{%saṃvāda,%} q.v.). § 716: Hearing the words of {%Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śuka%} understood that great misery follows the acquisition
<div n="lb">of children and wives, and that one has to undergo great
<div n="lb">labour in order to acquire science and Vedic lore. He
<div n="lb">resolved to attain to the highest end, that is fraught with
<div n="lb">the greatest felicity, and whence there is no return into the
<div n="lb">ocean of births; “that cannot be attained without {%yoga;%}
<div n="lb">I shall therefore have recourse to {%yoga,%} and throwing off this
<div n="lb">body I shall become transformed into wind and enter the Sun;
<div n="lb">for he does not wane like the Moon (Soma) with the gods; when
<div n="lb">after death one enters the moon he falls to earth and thence
<div n="lb">ascends to heaven; with the great Ṛṣis I shall enter the
<div n="lb">energy of the Sun; I declare before all the creatures…
<div n="lb">earth,…D., Dā., G., Pś., U., Rā., and R., that I shall
<div n="lb">enter all creatures in the world.” Obtaining {%Nārada's%} per-
<div n="lb">mission, {%Śuka%} went to {%Vyāsa,%} who asked him to stay there for
<div n="lb">the day that he might behold him for some time. But {%Śuka,%} only
<div n="lb">intent on emancipation, immediately left him and proceeded
<div n="lb">to {%Kailāsa,%} which was inhabited by crowds of ascetics (XII,
<div n="lb">{@332@}). Having reached the summit of {%Kailāsa, Śuka%} set
<div n="lb">himself to practise {%yoga%} (description). Having then obtained
<div n="lb">the permission of {%Nārada,%} he soared into the skies and identified
<div n="lb">himself with the element of wind; Aps. ({%Pañcacūḍā,%} etc.),
<div n="lb">G., R., etc., wondered. {%Śuka%} proceeded in silence, his face
<div n="lb">turned towards the east, regarding the sun; then to the
<div n="lb">{%Malaya%} mountain; {%Urvaśī%} and {%Pūrvacitti,%} who always dwell
<div n="lb">on {%Malaya,%} wondered. {%Śuka%} asked the gods, etc., to return
<div n="lb">his father an answer from him, if he should repeatedly call
<div n="lb">on him (XII, {@333@}). {%Śuka%} freed himself of the four kinds of
<div n="lb">faults, the eight kinds of {%tamas,%} the five kinds of {%rajas,%} the
<div n="lb">attribute of {%sattva,%} and then dwelt in {%Bráhman.%} Meteors began
<div n="lb">to shoot, etc.; {%Indra%} poured showers of rain; {%Himavat%} and {%Meru%}
<div n="lb">(the one yellow, made of gold; the other white, made of
<div n="lb">silver), each 100 yojanas in height and breadth, were in close
<div n="lb">contact with each other. Journeying towards the north, {%Śuka%}
<div n="lb">clashed against them, and they were immediately broken in two.
<div n="lb">He was adored by G., R., Y., Rā., and {%Vidyādharas.%} He saw
<div n="lb">from a high region the celestial stream {%Mandākinī%} running
<div n="lb">below, with many Aps. Beholding {%Śuka,%} who was bodyless,
<div n="lb">those unclad aërial beings felt no shame. {%Vyāsa%} followed
<div n="lb">behind him on the same aërial path, by means of high {%Yoga.%}
<div n="lb">{%Śuka,%} above the region of the wind, identified himself with
<div n="lb">{%Bráhman.%} Ṛ. represented to {%Vyāsa%} the achievements of his
<div n="lb">son. He indulged in lamentations; {%Śuka,%} who had entered
<div n="lb">the universe, had become the soul of everything, and had
<div n="lb">acquired omnipresence, answered by uttering {%bho%} in the form
<div n="lb">of an echo, and the entire universe echoed the answer of {%Śuka%}
<div n="lb">from that time; mountain caves and mountain sides still
[Page219-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">echo sounds uttered there. Having cast off all the attributes
<div n="lb">of sound, etc., and showing his {%yoga%} prowess in the manner
<div n="lb">of his disappearance, {%Śuka%} in this way attained to the
<div n="lb">highest station. {%Vyāsa%} sat down and began to think of his
<div n="lb">son with grief; the Aps. who were sporting on the banks of
<div n="lb">the celestial stream {%Mandākinī%} saw him seated there, and
<div n="lb">all became agitated with shame. {%Śiva,%} with D., G., and
<div n="lb">great Ṛ., came and comforted {%Vyāsa,%} who by the favour of {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">thenceforward always beheld a shadow of his son by his side.
<div n="lb">“This {%Nārada%} and {%Vyāsa%} repeatedly told me in days of yore”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@334@}). [PCR. rightly remarks that, according to this
<div n="lb">story, {%Śuka%} who recited the Bhāgavata to Parikṣit, the
<div n="lb">grandson of Yudhiṣṭhira, could not possibly be the {%Śuka%}
<div n="lb">who was {%Vyāsa's%} son.]
