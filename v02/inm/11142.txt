[{@Umā-Maheśvara-saṃvāda@}]¦ (“the discourse between
<div n="lb">Umā and Śiva”). § 768{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Nārada%} said:
<div n="lb">Once, {%Śiva%} on {%Himavat,%} the resort of Si. and Cā., practised
<div n="lb">severe penances, surrounded by Aps., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (copious
<div n="lb">descriptions). Then came {%Umā%} (description) and with her
<div n="lb">hands covered the eyes of {%Śiva%} from behind, and darkness
<div n="lb">arose all around; but suddenly the darkness disappeared:
<div n="lb">a third eye appeared on his forehead and consumed the
<div n="lb">mountain; {%Umā%} stood before him with her hands joined; he
<div n="lb">directed benignant looks towards the mountain, which, in a
<div n="lb">moment, was restored to its former condition. {%Umā%} asked why
<div n="lb">his eastern, northern, and western faces are so handsome, and
<div n="lb">the southern so terrible (1); why his matted locks are tawny
<div n="lb">and erect (2); why his throat is blue (3); why he has always
<div n="lb">the {%Pināka%} in his hand (4); why he is always a {%brahmacārin%}
<div n="lb">with matted locks (5). {%Śiva%} promised to explain it to her
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@140@}). {%Śiva%} answered the above questions (1): “In
<div n="lb">days of yore {%Tilottamā,%} created by {%Brahmán%} (cf. I, ch. {@211@}),
<div n="lb">circumambulated me; in whatever direction she turned, a
<div n="lb">new face of mine appeared through my {%yoga-%}power; with my
<div n="lb">eastern face I exercise the sovereignty of the universe; with
<div n="lb">my northern I sport with thee (i.e. {%Umā%}); with my western
<div n="lb">I ordain the happiness of creatures; with my southern
<div n="lb">I destroy all creatures. (2 and 5): In order to do good to
<div n="lb">all creatures. (3): In days of yore, {%Indra,%} desirous of
<div n="lb">acquiring my prosperity hurled his thunderbolt at me, which
<div n="lb">scorched my throat. (4): In order to accomplish the purposes
<div n="lb">of the gods.” {%Umā:%} Why hast thou selected a bull for thy
<div n="lb">vehicle? {%Śiva:%} In days of yore, {%Brahmán%} created {%Surabhi%}
<div n="lb">(the celestial cow); once, froth fell from one of her calves on
<div n="lb">my body; my wrath scorched all the kine which became
<div n="lb">diversified in hue; {%Brahmán%} pacified me and gave me this
<div n="lb">bull both as a vehicle and as a device. {%Umā:%} Why dost
<div n="lb">thou reside in the cemetery (description), abandoning thy
<div n="lb">many abodes in heaven? {%Śiva:%} I do not see any spot that
<div n="lb">is more sacred than the cemetery, and my {%Bhūtas%} love to
<div n="lb">reside in such spots. {%Umā:%} What are the indications of
<div n="lb">{%dharma? Śiva:%} Abstention from injury, etc. {%Umā:%} What
<div n="lb">are the duties of the four castes? {%Śiva%} enumerated them.
<div n="lb">{%Umā:%} What are the common duties of all the castes?
<div n="lb">{%Śiva:%} Whenever the world is created, three eternal religions
<div n="lb">are created by {%Brahmán:%} the {%Veda,%} the {%smṛti,%} and the
<div n="lb">practice of the righteous, etc.; there are four classes of
<div n="lb">{%bhikṣus: kuṭīcaka, bahūdaka, haṃsa,%} and {%paramahaṃsa%} (each
<div n="lb">in turn being superior to the preceding one; v. Nīl.). {%Umā:%}
<div n="lb">What is the religion of the {%ṛṣis (munis)? Śiva:%} (1) the
<div n="lb">{%Phenapas%} always gather the froth from the {%amṛta%} that
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} drank at a great sacrifice. (2) The {%Vālakhilyas%}
<div n="lb">in the solar disc, adopting the practice of the birds, live by
<div n="lb">picking up grains {%(uñche),%} clad in deer-skins or bark of trees;
<div n="lb">they are only as big as the joint of the thumb; they have
<div n="lb">burnt all their sins by severe penances. (3) The {%Cakracaras%}
<div n="lb">in the {%Somaloka,%} near to {%Pitṛloka,%} live by gleaning [differently
[Page690-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">Nīl.], devoted to compassion. (4) The {%Samprakṣālas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Aśmakuṭṭas,%} and {%Dantolūkhalikas%} [v. Nīl. and the note of
<div n="lb">PCR., p. 642], near the gods [called] {%Somapas%} and {%Ūṣmapas%}
<div n="lb">(C. {%U°%}), live by gleaning [“drinking the rays of {%Soma,%}”
<div n="lb">PCR.], together with their wives, etc. ({%Śiva%} copiously
<div n="lb">described the religion of the Ṛ. in general) (XIII, {@141@}).
<div n="lb">{%Umā:%} What is the religion of the {%Vānaprasthas? Śiva%}
<div n="lb">described it ({%vīrāsana, maṇḍūka-yoga, paurṇamāsya, cāturmāsya,%}
<div n="lb">etc.); they attain to {%Brahmaloka%} or {%Somaloka. Umā:%} What
<div n="lb">is the religion of the {%munis (munisaṅghasya)%} in their
<div n="lb">doctrines of perfection ({%siddhivādeṣu;%} i.e. {%jñānagoṣṭhīṣu,%}
<div n="lb">Nīl.; “followers of the scriptures treating of ascetic success,”
<div n="lb">PCR.)? they live unrestrained in the forest, together with their
<div n="lb">wives. {%Śiva:%} Their characteristics are the shaving of the
<div n="lb">head, yellow robes, passing the night at home, ablutions
<div n="lb">three times a day, {%hotra, samādhi,%} adherence to the path of
<div n="lb">the good, etc. All those duties of which I have spoken
<div n="lb">before as belonging to forest-recluses, are the duties of these
<div n="lb">also, etc. (copious description). Asked by {%Umā, Śiva%} said:
<div n="lb">By fasts, etc., one attains to heaven and sports with G.; by
<div n="lb">{%maṇḍūkayoga%} and {%dīkṣā%} with the {%Nāgas;%} by living with
<div n="lb">deer, etc., one attains to {%Amarāvatī;%} by subsisting upon air
<div n="lb">or water, fruits and roots, one attains to the riches of Y. and
<div n="lb">sports with Aps.; by abandoning one's body in the ocean,
<div n="lb">having lived in dependence only of himself, etc., one attains
<div n="lb">to the world of {%Varuṇa;%} by the same practices and piercing
<div n="lb">one's feet with a stone, one rejoices with the Gh., others obtain
<div n="lb">{%Brahmaloka%} (having abandoned their bodies in fire as an
<div n="lb">oblation to the gods), {%Śakraloka,%} etc. (XIII, {@142@}). Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Umā, Śiva%} expounded the circumstances under which one
<div n="lb">may be promoted or degraded to a higher or lower order when
<div n="lb">reborn (XIII, {@143@}). Asked by {%Umā, Śiva%} (worshipped by
<div n="lb">D. and As.) discoursed as to how men succeed in ascending to
<div n="lb">heaven, and what words, thoughts, and acts are of importance
<div n="lb">in this respect and for acquiring a long life. “This is the
<div n="lb">way that was indicated by {%Brahmán%} himself” (XIII, {@144@}).
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Umā, Śiva%} discoursed about that conduct by which
<div n="lb">a man may attain to heaven (Aps., the woods of {%Nandana%}),
<div n="lb">quoting {%Brahmán;%} the unmerciful, etc., sink into hell; they
<div n="lb">who humiliate their preceptors and seniors are reborn as
<div n="lb">{%Śvapākas%} and {%Pukkasas.%} Then (asked by {%Umā%}) he explained
<div n="lb">why some men become possessed of wisdom or the contrary,
<div n="lb">blind, diseased, etc.; what acts are faulty, and what faultless;
<div n="lb">why some are observant of vows, some like Rā. {%(Brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%rākṣasas)%} in conduct, unmindful of {%homa%} and {%vaṣaṭkāra%}
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@145@}). {%Nārada%} said: Now {%Śiva%} himself became
<div n="lb">desirous of hearing. Saying that {%Umā%} (acquainted with all
<div n="lb">duties, etc.) used to converse every day with {%Sāvitrī,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), who all regard their husbands as their gods, he questioned
<div n="lb">{%Umā%} about the duties of women; “half of my body is made
<div n="lb">up of half thy body; thon…art the cause of the peopling of
<div n="lb">the earth.” {%Umā%} said she would first consult the rivers,
<div n="lb">who, with the waters of all {%tīrthas,%} are approaching {%Śiva%} in
<div n="lb">order to enable him to perform his ablutions: {%Sarasvatī%} (the
<div n="lb">first of all streams), going to the ocean, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Gaṅgā%} was
<div n="lb">selected for answering the question, and praised {%Umā's%}
<div n="lb">modesty; then {%Umā%} discoursed upon the duties of women in
<div n="lb">full. She should not cast her eyes on the moon or the sun
<div n="lb">or a tree that has a masculine name. The husband is the
<div n="lb">god of the woman. If a husband being poor, or diseased,
<div n="lb">or distressed, etc., were to command his wife to accomplish
<div n="lb">anything improper or unrighteous, the wife should, without
<div n="lb">hesitation, do so according to the practice allowable in
[Page691-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">time of distress, and she becomes entitled to a share in the
<div n="lb">merit acquired by her husband. {%Nārada%} said: {%Śiva%} applauded
<div n="lb">{%Umā%} and dismissed the others; Bh., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), returned home
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@146@}). Asked by Ṛ., {%Śiva%} discoursed on the glory of
<div n="lb">{%Vāsudeva,%} i.e. Kṛṣṇa, q.v. (XIII, {@147@}). {%Nārada%} said: At
<div n="lb">the conclusion of {%Śiva's%} speech loud roars were heard in the
<div n="lb">firmament, etc. Some of Ṛ. set out on a {%tīrthayātrā,%} others
<div n="lb">returned whence they came.
