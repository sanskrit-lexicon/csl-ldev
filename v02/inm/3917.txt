[{@Gadāyuddhaparvan@}¦ ({%°va%})] (“the section relating to
the battle with maces”). Cf. Gadāparvan, Gadāyuddha.
§ 613: Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), {%Sañjaya%} related:
{%Duryodhana%} agreed to fight his foes, one at a time (<lang n="greek">β</lang>);
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} granted his request, adding that if he could
slay even one of the five {%Pāṇḍavas%} he would remain king.
{%Duryodhana%} rose from the lake and challenged the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} taunted him with his unfair conduct in
slaying {%Abhimanyu%} (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (IX, {@32@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} reproved {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} for his rashness in staking everything on the result
of such a single combat with {%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); {%Bhīmasena%}
assured {%Kṛṣṇa%} that {%Duryodhana%} would be no match for him in
an encounter with the mace (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%} applauded {%Bhīma%},
and exhorted him to slay {%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek">η</lang>); {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>),
applauded {%Bhīma; Bhīma's%} boastful address (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>) to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
and {%Duryodhana; Duryodhana's%} dignified reply, applauded by
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%}; the elephants began to grunt
and the steeds to neigh; the weapons of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} blazed
forth of their own accord (IX, {@33@}).—§ 614: When the battle
between {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryodhana%} was about to commence,
{%Bala-Rāma (b%}), having heard that that battle between his
two disciples was about to begin, came and was worshipped by
the {%Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); he said that forty-two days
had passed since he departed, having set out under the
constellation {%Puṣya%} and come back under the constellation
{%Śravaṇa%}; he was clad in blue robes and of fair complexion.
Then that dreadful encounter took place (IX, {@34@}).—§ 615:
Requested by {%Janamejaya%} (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), {%Vaiśampāyana%} related how
{%Bala-Rāma%} had determined upon and set out (under the
constellation {%Maitra%}) on a pilgrimage to the {%tīrthas%} on the
{%Sarasvatī%} (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), having let the sacred fire be brought from {%Dvārakā%}
and the priests, and having given away rich donations to every-
one who wished for them, accompanied by priests, friends,
brahmans, chariots, elephants, steeds, and servants, visiting
all the sacred places along her course. In the course of his
wanderings he at last came to {%Kurukṣetra%}. Requested by
{%Janamejaya%} (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), {%Vaiśampāyana%} related the {%Baladevatīrthayātrā%}
(q.v.) (IX, {@35—54@}). Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%}
related: Beholding {%Bala-Rāma, Duryodhana%} rejoiced.
According to the proposal of {%Bala-Rāma, Yudhiṣṭhira%} with
[Page286-b+ 63]
his brothers and {%Duryodhana%} proceeded westwards to {%Samanta-%}
{%pañcaka%} on the southern side of the {%Sarasvatī%}. D. and
Cā. praised {%Duryodhana%}. Description of {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>). {%Duryodhana%} told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (who was standing
among his brothers and {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rāma%}) to behold the battle,
protected by the {%Kaikeyas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>). That large assembly of
kings sat down, as did also {%Bala-Rāma%}, who was worshipped by
all around him. {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryodhana%} stood inciting each
other with violent speeches (IX, {@55@}). The dispute between
the two heroes (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>). At last {%Duryodhana%} said, “What is
the use of bragging? fight with me,” and was applauded
by the {%Somakas%}, etc. The elephants grunted aloud and the
steeds neighed repeatedly; the weapons of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
blazed forth of their own accord (IX, {@56@}). Description of
the combat; D., G., and men wondered; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
the {%Somakas%} feared; adopting the manœuvre called {%Kauśika%},
{%Duryodhana%} baffled {%Bhīma's%} mace; as {%Duryodhana%} once fell
down to the earth, the {%Sṛñjayas%} cried aloud, so also did the
{%Pāṇḍavas; Bhīmasena%} then had his coat of mail fractured and
was prostrated on the ground, but rose, steadying himself
with great effort (IX, {@57@}). {%Arjuna%} inquired of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
about the relative merits of the two combatants; {%Kṛṣṇa%}
said that their training had been equal, but {%Bhīma%} was
superior in strength; {%Duryodhana%} was superior in skill and
had had more practice; by fighting fairly {%Bhīma%} would never
succeed in winning, but by fighting unfairly he would surely
be able to slay {%Duryodhana%}, just as the {%Asuras%} were vanquished
by the gods, {%Virocana%} and {%Vṛtra%} by {%Indra%} with the aid of
deception; “{%Bhīma%} has vowed to break the thighs of {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} with his mace; let him accomplish that vow of his”;
he censured {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} for his folly, and quoted a verse
uttered by {%Uśanas%}; “{%Duryodhana%} has practised with the
mace for full thirteen years.” {%Arjuna%} struck his own left
thigh before the eyes of {%Bhīmasena%}, who understood the sign.
As {%Duryodhana%} set his heart on the manœuvre called {%dvasthāna%}
and jumped upwards, {%Bhīmasena%} hurled his mace at the thighs
of {%Duryodhana%} and fractured them. Portents appeared; showers
of blood and showers of dust were poured by {%Indra%}; a loud
noise was made by Y., Rā., and Pś. (description of the
portents); the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were filled with
anxiety; D., G., Si., and Cā. went away (IX, {@58@}). The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Somakas%} rejoiced; {%Bhīmasena%} rebuked {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}, and touched his head with his left foot, which was
censured by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who grieved for {%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>)
(IX, {@59@}); {%Baladeva's%} wrath was excited upon seeing {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} struck below the navel; he rushed on to slay {%Bhīma%},
but was seized and pacified by {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>). {%Baladeva%} praised
{%Duryodhana%} and cursed {%Bhīmasena%}, and then ascended his
chariot and proceeded towards {%Dvārakā%}. The {%Pāñcālas%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">υ</lang>), became dejected; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīmasena%},
etc., and {%Duryodhana%} spoke about what had passed (IX, {@80@})
({%Kṛṣṇa%} asking the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors to forbear insulting
{%Duryodhana; Duryodhana's%} angry reply to {%Kṛṣṇa%}, charging
him with every unfair act in course of the battle; {%Kṛṣṇa%}
reminded {%Duryodhana%} of his own evil acts, and referred to his
miserable end as the inevitable consequence of those acts;
{%Duryodhana's%} boast with reference to his end, which he
pronounced to be most glorious) (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>). Celestial showers
descended on {%Duryodhana's%} head; G., Aps., and Si. praised
him. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} became ashamed; but {%Kṛṣṇa%}
justified the use of unfair means for the slaughter of the {%Kuru%}
warriors (<lang n="greek">χ</lang>) (IX, {@61@}). The {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors proceeded to the
{%Kuru%} camp, which was entirely deserted (<lang n="greek">ψ</lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused
[Page287-a+ 63]
{%Arjuna%} to take down the {%Gāṇḍīva%} and his inexhaustible quivers,
and then to dismount; then {%Kṛṣṇa%} also dismounted; the
celestial ape disappeared, and the chariot (burnt by {%Droṇa%} and
{%Karṇa%} with the {%Brāhma%} weapon), with its steeds, etc., was
reduced to ashes. {%Kṛṣṇa%} congratulated {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} on his
victory, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} attributed that victory to {%Kṛṣṇa's%}
power (<lang n="greek">ω</lang>). In the encampment of the {%Kurus%} they found great
wealth; at {%Kṛṣṇa's%} suggestion the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Sātyaki%}
resolved to pass the night at a spot outside the camp, on the
banks of the {%Oghavatī%}. They then dispatched {%Kṛṣṇa%} to
{%Hāstinapura%} in order to pacify the wrath of {%Gāndhārī%}, and to
comfort her and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}. He set out with {%Dāruka%} upon
his chariot, yoked with {%Śaibya%} and {%Sugrīva%} (IX, {@62@}). Asked
by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} said that the reason why {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} sent {%Kṛṣṇa%} to {%Hāstinapura%} was his fear that {%Gāndhārī%},
by means of her ascetic merit, should reduce the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to
ashes, because {%Duryodhana%} had been slain unfairly (<lang n="greek">αα</lang>); “{%Vyāsa%}
will be there.” {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused {%Dāruka%} to equip his chariot, and
quickly set out for {%Hāstinapura%}. He arrived at {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
palace, where {%Vyāsa%} had arrived before him; he comforted
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (<lang n="greek">ββ</lang>) and {%Gāndhārī%} (<lang n="greek">γγ</lang>), who said that her
heart had again become steady (<lang n="greek">δδ</lang>). Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} came to
know the evil that was meditated by {%Aśvatthāman%}, and
suddenly took leave, requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Gāndhārī%}
to protect the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and proceeded with {%Dāruka. Vyāsa%}
comforted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Kṛṣṇa%} arrived at the camp and
informed the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (IX, {@63@}). Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
{%Sañjaya%} narrated the lamentations of {%Duryodhana%} while lying
on the field with his thighs broken (<lang n="greek">εε</lang>); he thought himself
happy, and asked {%Sañjaya%} to bring his message to his parents
and to {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζζ</lang>) (“you should never place any
confidence in the {%Pāṇḍavas%}”), and took leave of the message-
bearers (<lang n="greek">εε</lang>); he was confident that {%Cārvāka%}, the mendicant
devotee, would avenge his death. Thousands of men, with
eyes full of tears, fled away; the earth trembled, etc. The
messengers went and informed {%Aśvatthāman%} and then went
away (IX, {@64@}). {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζζ</lang>), came to {%Duryodhana%},
who lay surrounded by carnivorous animals, etc. {%Aśvatthā-%}
{%man's%} lament and {%Duryodhana's%} reply (<lang n="greek">ηη</lang>); {%Aśvatthāman%}
vowed to slay all the {%Pāñcālas; Duryodhana%} let {%Kṛpa%} install
{%Aśvatthāman%} as the {%Kuru%} generalissimo; then they took leave
of {%Duryodhana%} and left him alone (IX, {@65@}).
