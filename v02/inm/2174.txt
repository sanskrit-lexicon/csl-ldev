[{@Cyavana-Kuśika-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}],¦ “the discourse
<div n="lb">between {%Cyavana%} and {%Kuśika.%}” § 745{%c%} (Cyavanop.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Cyavana Bhārgava%} saw the stain that
<div n="lb">would affect his own race and desired to consume the race
<div n="lb">of the {%Kuśikas;%} he came and said to king {%Kuśika%} that he
<div n="lb">desired to dwell with him for some time. {%Kuśika%} and his
<div n="lb">wife welcomed and honoured him; according to his desire,
<div n="lb">they promised to serve him, while he observed a vow. Once
<div n="lb">he slept for twenty-one days, while {%Kuśika%} and the queen
<div n="lb">kept themselves awake, foregoing all food; then {%Cyavana%} went
<div n="lb">out, followed by the king and the queen, and disappeared
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@52@}); the king with the queen sorrowfully returned
<div n="lb">to the palace, where he found {%Cyavana%} stretched as before
<div n="lb">on his bed, and sat by his side, while he slept for twenty-one
<div n="lb">days; then {%Cyavana%} ordered them to rub him, and then
<div n="lb">entered the bathing house, and once more disappeared by means
<div n="lb">of his {%yoga%}-power. The next time, {%C.%} was seen on the throne;
<div n="lb">then he ordered food (description), but reduced it all to
<div n="lb">ashes, and disappeared. {%Kuśika%} with his queen stood there
<div n="lb">in the same posture the whole night without speaking
<div n="lb">a word, without giving way to wrath. So it went on every
<div n="lb">day. {%Cyavana%} failed to notice any fault in the conduct of the
<div n="lb">king. Then he ordered them to yoke themselves to a chariot
<div n="lb">and pull him along; it should be the king's battle-chariot with
<div n="lb">every weapon, etc., and the goad (description); they must
<div n="lb">drag him slowly in the sight of the people, who lamented;
<div n="lb">suddenly he struck them with the goad, so that they were
<div n="lb">covered with blood; no food had passed their lips for fifty
<div n="lb">nights; on his way he began to give away very largely of the
<div n="lb">king's property. Then {%Cyavana,%} delighted, came down from
<div n="lb">the chariot, unharnessed the royal couple, and granted them
<div n="lb">a boon; he softly touched them with his hands, the healing
<div n="lb">virtues of which were like ambrosia, and all their fatigue, etc.,
<div n="lb">was dispelled, and they once more became endued with youth.
<div n="lb">He dismissed them till the next day, himself remaining on the
<div n="lb">banks of the {%Gaṅgā.%} Meanwhile {%Cyavana,%} by his {%yoga%}-power,
[Page180-a+ 59]
<div n="lb">converted that delightful wood on the bank of the {%Gaṅgā%}
<div n="lb">into a retreat full of wealth of every kind and jewels and gems
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@53@}). The next morning {%Kuśika%} came with his wife,
<div n="lb">and saw that palace made entirely of gold, etc. (description),
<div n="lb">and Aps. and G., and thought that it was the country of the
<div n="lb">{%Uttara-Kurus%} or {%Indra's%} abode {%Amarāvatī. Cyavana%} lay
<div n="lb">stretched on a costly and excellent bed, and at the same time
<div n="lb">on a mat of {%kuśa%}-grass. In a moment everything disappeared,
<div n="lb">Aps., G., etc. {%Cyavana%} praised {%Kuśika%} and his queen; {%Kuśika%}
<div n="lb">said that he had a sufficient boon, not having been consumed
<div n="lb">by the fire of {%Cyavana's%} penances; he asked him to expound
<div n="lb">some doubts (XIII, {@54@}). Asked by {%Kuśika, Cyavana%} explained
<div n="lb">the reason of his conduct: In days past, when the gods had
<div n="lb">assembled together, he had heard {%Brahmán%} say that, owing
<div n="lb">to a contention between {%brahman-%} and {%kṣattriya-%}energy,
<div n="lb">there would occur an intermixture in his race; therefore he
<div n="lb">had resolved to exterminate the {%Kuśikas,%} but had failed to
<div n="lb">find any fault with {%Kuśika;%} seeing the delightful palace he
<div n="lb">had created, {%Kuśika%} had had a foretaste of heaven and had
<div n="lb">become desirous of the status of a {%brahman%} and the merit of
<div n="lb">penances; “the person who will be the third in descent from
<div n="lb">thee shall attain to the status of a {%brahman;%} through the
<div n="lb">energy of the {%Bhṛgus,%} thy grandson will be an ascetic endued
<div n="lb">with the splendour of fire; I shall set out on a {%tīrthayātrā.”%}
<div n="lb">{%Kuśika%} asked in what way the status of brahmanhood would
<div n="lb">attach to his race (XIII, {@55@}). {%Cyavana%} foretold that the
<div n="lb">{%Kṣattriyas%} would exterminate the {%Bhārgavas,%} except {%Ūrva,%}
<div n="lb">who would cast the fire of his wrath into the mare's mouth
<div n="lb">{%(Vaḍavā-vaktra)%} in the Ocean; he would have a son {%Ṛcīka,%}
<div n="lb">to whom {%Dhanurveda%} in its incarnate form would come in
<div n="lb">order to exterminate all {%Kṣattriyas;%} he would communicate
<div n="lb">it to his son {%Jamadagni:%}

<div n="lb">{%Kuśika%} became filled with joy; {%Cyavana%} set out on his {%tīrtha-%}
<div n="lb">{%yātrā;%} everything fell out as {%Cyavana%} had said (XIII, {@56@}).
