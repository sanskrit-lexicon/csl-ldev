{@Śukakṛtya(ṃ)@}¦ (“the works of Śuka”). § 714 (Mokṣadh.):
XII, {@328—9@} (12312—12421) (continuation of {%Śukakṛti%}).
{%Bhīṣma%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}: Having heard the words of
{%Janaka%}, having entered Soul by [his] soul and having seen
Self by his self ({%ātmānam ātmanāsthāya dṛṣṭvā cātmānam%}
{%ātmanā), Śuka%} without putting further questions to {%Janaka%},
proceeded northwards to {%Śaiśira%} (through the air). At
that time {%Nārada%} proceeded to {%Himavat (b%}). Then {%Śuka%}
came to the asylum of {%Vyāsa%}. One day the disciples
asked {%Vyāsa%} to let no sixth disciple be skilled in the
Veda. {%Vyāsa%} answered that they ought to multiply, and
the Veda to be spread, and taught them the qualifications
of persons that can be accepted as disciples, and the rules
in respect of the study of the Veda (XII, {@328@}). The
disciples of {%Vyāsa%} took leave of him and descended from
the mountain to the earth for the purpose of subdividing the
[Page219-b+ 62]
Vedas; there they performed the agniṣṭoma, etc., at the
sacrifices of Brahmans, Kṣattriyas, and Vaiśyas, and taught
the Veda. {%Vyāsa%} remained with {%Śuka%}, passing his days in
anxious thoughtfulness. {%Nārada%} came and asked him why
Vedic sounds were silent now, so that the mountain now
resembled a hamlet of {%Niṣādas%}, and Ṛ., D., and G. did no
longer shine as before; and exhorted {%Vyāsa%} to recite the
Veda and thereby dispel the fears arising from Rā. {%Vyāsa%}
and {%Śuka%} then set themselves to recite the Veda. One day
a violent wind arose which {%Vyāsa%} declared to be an omen
that the recitation of the Veda should be suspended; and he
explained the {%Devayāna%} and the {%Pitṛyāna%}, and the Winds
({%Samāna%}, etc. {%[g]%}; cf. {%Sādhyāḥ%}), especially {%Pravaha (h%}),
{%Āvaha (i), Udvaha (j), Saṃvaha (k), Vivaha (l), Parivaha%}
({%m), Parāvaha (n%}); “this wind is the breath of {%Viṣṇu's%}
nostrils.” Having said this {%Vyāsa%} plunged into the celestial
Ganges. (For continuation v. {%Śuka-Nāradasaṃvāda%}.)
