({%°kṛt%}, i.e. Vyāsa).—§ 795{%c%} (Svargārohaṇap.): Sauti said:
“The race of the {%Bharatas%} is the topic [of the {%M%}.]. Therefore
[Page454-a+ 63]
it is called Bhārata, and on account of this and of its greatness
it is called {%M%}. (v. 192); this history is called Jaya, it should
be heard by everyone who desires emancipation,” etc.
Blessing to the reader. {%Vyāsa%} made an abstract of the {%Bhārata%}
from love of righteousness; he made another compilation
({%saṃhitāṃ%}) of six millions of verses; three millions of these
verses are placed in {%Devaloka%}, 1,500,000 among the Pitṛs,
1,400,000 among the Yakṣas, and 100,000 among men.
{%Nārada%} recited it to the gods, {%Asita Devala%} to the {%Pitṛs%},
{%Śuka%} to the {%Rākṣasas%} and {%Yakṣas; Vaiśampāyana%} to men;
it is equal to the {%Vedas%}; blessing to the reader; the {%Sāvitrī%}
of the {%Bhārata%} (i.e. vv. 203{%b%}—207) is quoted; “what need
has that man of a sprinkling of the waters of Puṣkara who
attentively listens to this Bhārata…?” (v. 211 + one
verse in {%B%}.) (XVII, {@5@})—Asked by {%Janamejaya%} according
to what rites one should listen to the Bhārata, etc., Vaiśam-
pāyana expounded what gods, etc., are found in the Mahā-
bhārata (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>); śrāddha offerings should be made after the
hearing of it, likewise gifts to the brahmans (specification);
one should appoint as reciter one who is pure, etc.; the
reciter, seated at his ease, free from all bodily complaints,
with rapt attention should recite the text without too much
slowness, etc.; (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>) the merit won at the conclusion of each
{%pāraṇa%} (<lang n="greek">π</lang>); the gifts that should be made at the conclusion
of each parvan (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>), its topic (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>) and fruits (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>) (XVIII, {@6@}):
XVIII, {@5@}, 190, 191, 192 (etymology); {@6@}, 299 ({%°ākhyanaṃ%}).
