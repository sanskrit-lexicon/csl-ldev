[{@Mahāprasthānikaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to
the great journey to the other world,” the 17th of the great
and the 99th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Mahā-
prasthānika(ṃ) parva(n)).—§ 794: {%Janamejaya%} said: Having
heard of the battle with iron clubs between the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and
{%Andhakas%}, and of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} ascension to heaven, what did
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} do? {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Having heard the
particulars of the great slaughter of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Yudhiṣṭhira%}
set his heart on leaving the world, saying to his brothers that
it is Time that ripens every creature, of which they approved.
He made the kingdom over to {%Yuyutsu%} and installed {%Parikṣit%}
as king in {%Rāstinapura%}, while {%Vajra%} ruled in {%Indraprastha%}.
Then he offered oblations of water to {%Kṛṣṇa, Rāma%}, and
{%Vasudeva%}, etc., and {%śrāddhas%} to his deceased kinsmen, and
fed {%Vyāsa, Nārada, Mārkaṇḍeya%}, and {%Yājñavalkya%}, and gave
jewels, etc. (specification) to brahmans in honour of {%Kṛṣṇa%}.
{%Kṛpa%} was installed as the preceptor of {%Parikṣit%}. Then he
summoned his subjects and informed them of his intentions;
they tried in vain to dissuade him. He and his brothers and
{%Draupadī%} removed their ornaments and wore barks of trees;
then they threw their sacred fires into the water. Then
they set out on their journey: the five {%Pāṇḍavas, Draupadī%},
and a dog. {%Kṛpa%}, etc., stood around {%Yuyutsu; Ulūpī%} entered
the waters of {%Gaṅgā; Citrāṅgada%} set out for {%Maṇipūra%}; the
grandmothers of {%Parikṣit%} surrounded him. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
etc., set out with their faces turned towards the east,
devoting themselves to {%yoga%}, resolved to observe the religion
of renunciation; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} first, then the other {%Pāṇḍavas%}
in the order of their birth, behind them all {%Draupadī%}; a dog
followed them. They reached the sea of red water. {%Agni%}
came, and mentioning the {%Khāṇḍava%} forest, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), he caused
{%Arjuna%} to throw the {%Gāṇḍīva%} and his inexhaustible quivers
into the water to be given back to {%Varuṇa%}. Then {%Agni%}
disappeared. They now proceeded towards the south; then,
by the northern coast of the salt sea, to the south-west;
then towards the west, where they saw {%Dvārakā%} covered by
the ocean; then to the north, observant of {%yoga%}, desirous
of making a round of the whole earth (XVII, {@1@}). They
crossed {%Himavat%}, and beheld a vast desert of sand, and
then {%Meru. Kṛṣṇā%} dropped down; asked by {%Bhīmasena%},
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that this was the consequence of her
partiality for {%Arjuna%}. Then {%Sahadeva%} fell down; asked by
{%Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira%} said it was because he never thought
anybody his equal in wisdom. They went on. {%Nakula%} fell;
asked by {%Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira%} said it was because he
thought that nobody equalled him in beauty, though his
righteousness was without blemish. {%Arjuna%} fell down;
asked by {%Bhīmasena, Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that it was because
{%Arjuna%} had said that he would consume all the foes in
a single day, but did not accomplish it. {%Bhīmasena%} fell
down; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told him it was because he was a great
eater, and used to boast of his strength. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
went on with the dog (XVII, {@2@}). {%Indra%} came with
a chariot, and asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to ascend it for going to
Heaven; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wanted to take {%Draupadī%} and his fallen
brothers with him; {%Indra%} said they have already reached
Heaven, where he will see them; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would have the
[Page456-b+ 63]
dog to accompany him; † as {%Indra%} said there is no place in
Heaven for persons with dogs, as the {%Krodhavaśas%} take away
all the merits of such persons, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} refused to ascend
the chariot. Then [the dog, transformed into] {%Dharma%}, said
to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (†vv. 80—9) that he had formerly tested him
in the {%Dvaitavana%}, where he had chosen the revival of {%Nakula%},
disregarding {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Arjuna%}, for doing good to his
[step] mother; “there is no one in Heaven that is equal
to thee.” Then {%Dharma, Indra%}, M., A., D., D.-ṛ., causing
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to ascend the chariot, proceeded to Heaven on
their respective chariots. {%Nārada%} said that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
was superior to all the R.-ṛ. there. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished
to proceed to where his brothers were; {%Indra%}, saying that
his brothers had won regions of felicity, tried to persuade
him to stay, beholding D.-ṛ. and Si.; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished
to be united with his brothers and {%Draupadī%} (XVII, {@3@}).
