{@[Kīcakavadhaparvan]@}¦ (“the slaughter of the Kīcakas”),
the 54th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr. § 551: The
Pāṇḍavas thus passed ten months in Matsya's city. As the
year was about to expire, Kīcaka, the senāpati and brother-
in-law of Virāṭa, became enamoured of Kṛṣṇā, who rebuked
him and warned him of the Gandharvas, her husbands (IV, {@14@}).
Then he caused Sudeṣṇā ({%Kaikeyī%}) to send Kṛṣṇā to him
to fetch wine. Kṛṣṇā adored the Sun, who commanded a
Rākṣasa to protect her invisibly (IV, {@15@}). As Kīcaka
seized her, she dashed him to the ground and rushed to
Yudhiṣṭhira, followed by Kīcaka, who brought her down
and seized her by the hair, but the Rākṣasa gave him
a puṣ, so that he fell down senseless. Yudhiṣṭhira,
apprehensive of discovery, commanded Bhīmasena to forbear.
Kṛṣṇā rebuked Virāṭa and was praised by the courtiers, but
sent back to Sudeṣṇā by Yudhiṣṭhira: “the Gandharvas
will surely dispel thy woe.” Sudeṣṇā said: “I shall cause
Kīcaka to be slain, if thou wishest it.” Kṛṣṇā answered:
“Even others will slay him” (IV, {@16@}). Kṛṣṇā rose up at
night and proceeded to Bhīmasena (IV, {@17@}), and complained
of their plight and especially that of Sahadeva ({%b%}) (IV, {@18—21@}).
Bhīmasena exhorted her to endure a little longer, reminding
her of Sukanyā, Indrasenā ({%c%}), Sītā, Lopāmudrā, and Sāvitrī
(IV, {@21@}), and said: “To-morrow evening you should manage
to have a meeting with Kīcaka in the dancing hall, but so that
others may not espy thee.” Kīcaka came to the rendezvous
and was slain by Bhīmasena, and Kṛṣṇā said to the keepers
of the dancing-hall: “Kīcaka has been slain by my Gandharva
husbands” (IV, {@22@}). Kīcaka's relatives obtained permission
from Virāṭa to cremate Kṛṣṇā with him, and carried her
towards the burning-place. She cried “Jaya”, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>).
Bhīmasena hearing it, came and slew 105 of them with a tree
(IV, {@23@}). Virāṭa got afraid and caused Sudeṣṇā to ask
Kṛṣṇā to leave the country, but she obtained permission to
remain for thirteen days (IV, {@24@}).
