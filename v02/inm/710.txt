[{@Āpaddharmaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">duties in cases of need,” the 89th of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.; cf. Āpaddharma). § 642: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīṣma%} what should be done by a weak and timid king,
<div n="lb">as also by one that is in great distress. {%Bhīṣma's%} answer
<div n="lb">recommending peace and even the surrender of territory.
<div n="lb">The king should never surrender his person as long as he
<div n="lb">can avoid doing so. If the invading enemy be righteous, the
<div n="lb">assailed king should make peace; if otherwise, the assailed
<div n="lb">should fight bravely and fall (XII, {@131@}). How a {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">should subsist in times of calamity. {%Bhīṣma%} began his
<div n="lb">exposition of the moral standard of unlucky times; in times
<div n="lb">of calamity the king may take from the wicked and give it
<div n="lb">to the good; at such times censurable acts do not become
<div n="lb">censurable; the king should never oppress {%brahmans,%} even
<div n="lb">at such times. Slander should be avoided. The tests
<div n="lb">of righteousness; difficulty in finding the course of duty.
<div n="lb">“Some regard ancient usage as the highest test of
<div n="lb">righteousness; they that are in favour of the conduct of
<div n="lb">{%Caṅkha%} towards {%Likhita%} do not hold this opinion” (XII,
<div n="lb">{@132@}). How a king should fill his treasury. The king
[Page062-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">should establish laws which he should never transgress
<div n="lb">(XII, {@133@}). The two duties of a {%kṣattriya%} are the
<div n="lb">acquisition of religious merit and of wealth. The advantages
<div n="lb">of Power (XII, {@134@}).—§ 643: The old story of a robber
<div n="lb">who having in this world been observant of restraint did
<div n="lb">not meet with destruction in the next: Kāyavya-carita {%(b)%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@135@}).—§ 644: What wealth should not be taken by
<div n="lb">the king (XII, {@136@}).—§ 645: Who enjoy happiness:
<div n="lb">Śākulopākhyāna {%(b)%} (XII, {@137@}).—§ 646. How a king
<div n="lb">should behave who is weak and threatened on all sides by
<div n="lb">powerful foes: the old story of the mouse, the cat, the owl,
<div n="lb">the mongoose, and the hunter, i.e. Mārjāra-mūṣika-
<div n="lb">saṃvāda {%(b).%} The moral of the story (XII, {@138@}).—§ 647:
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the conversation between the bird {%Pūjanī%}
<div n="lb">and king {%Brahmadatta,%} i.e. Brahmadatta-Pūjanī-saṃvāda
<div n="lb">{%(b)%} (XII, {@139@}).—§ 648: How a king should behave when
<div n="lb">there is a general decadence of righteousness: the old story
<div n="lb">of the discourse between {%Bhāradvāja%} and king {%Śatruñjaya,%}
<div n="lb">i.e. Kaṇikopadeśa {%(b)%} (XII, {@140@}).—§ 649: How a
<div n="lb">{%brahman%} should live when there is terrible distress around.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said that the {%Kṛta,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), are all dependent on the
<div n="lb">king's conduct, citing the old story of the discourse between
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra%} and the {%Cāṇḍāla%} in a hamlet inhabited by {%Cāṇḍālas.%}
<div n="lb">Towards the end of {%Tretā%} and the beginning of {%Dvāpara%}
<div n="lb">a frightful drought occurred extending over twelve years;
<div n="lb">the planet {%Bṛhaspati%} began to move in a retrograde course,
<div n="lb">and {%Soma%} receded towards the south, etc. (description); the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} abstained from sacrifices and recitations of the {%Vedas,%}
<div n="lb">and no longer uttered {%vaṣaṭs,%} etc.; the very {%Ṛṣis,%} giving
<div n="lb">up their vows, began to wander hither and thither. M.-ṛ.
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra,%} leaving his wife and son, wandered fireless and
<div n="lb">homeless, and regardless of food, clean and unclean. One
<div n="lb">day he came upon a hamlet, in the midst of a forest,
<div n="lb">inhabited by cruel hunters, etc. (description of a {%Cāṇḍāla%}
<div n="lb">hamlet). {%Viśvāmitra,%} in rage of hunger, wanted to steal
<div n="lb">a dog's haunch (“theft is allowable in a season of distress
<div n="lb">even for an eminent person;…in the first place one
<div n="lb">should steal from a low person…”). He was discovered
<div n="lb">and harshly addressed by the owner; but when the {%Cāṇḍāla%}
<div n="lb">learned who he was he addressed him respectfully, and
<div n="lb">dissuaded him from eating dog's meat, as the dog is less
<div n="lb">clean than a jackal, and the haunch of a dog is much
<div n="lb">worse than other parts of his body; “only the five kinds
<div n="lb">of five-clawed animals are clean food for {%brahmans%} and
<div n="lb">{%kṣattriyas%} and {%vaiśyas,%} as laid down in the scriptures”
<div n="lb">{%(yathāśāstraṃ). Viśvāmitra%} said that it is the duty of the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} to behave like {%Agni%} (as it is the duty of the
<div n="lb">{%kṣattriyas%} to behave like {%Indra%}), that the {%Vedas%} are fire,
<div n="lb">and that fire at times becomes a consumer of everything;
<div n="lb">“life is better than death; if living one may acquire
<div n="lb">virtue”; he mentioned that {%Agastya,%} when hungry, ate up
<div n="lb">the {%Asura Vātāpi%} (“a man who is a Ṛṣi cannot do what
<div n="lb">is sinful”). Notwithstanding the warnings of the {%Cāṇḍāla,%}
<div n="lb">{%Viśvamitra%} took away that haunch of dog's meat into
<div n="lb">the woods and wished to eat it with his wife, having
<div n="lb">gratified the gods and the {%Pitṛs;%} igniting a fire according to
<div n="lb">the {%Brāhma%} rites and cooking a {%caru%} according to the
<div n="lb">{%Aindrāgneya%} rites, dividing the {%caru%} into due portions, he
<div n="lb">invoked the gods, including {%Indra.%} Meanwhile {%Indra%} began to
<div n="lb">pour rain copiously. {%Viśvāmitra,%} having completed the rites,
<div n="lb">himself ate that meat. Afterwards he destroyed all his sins
<div n="lb">by his penances and acquired the most wonderful success
<div n="lb">(XII, {@141@}).—§ 650: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was distressed at the
[Page062-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">possibility of such acts of impiety being mentioned as a duty.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said that kings should gather wisdom from various
<div n="lb">sources, and not from the {%Vedas%} alone. Those who blame
<div n="lb">the injunctions of the scriptures, etc., are hucksters in
<div n="lb">learning and {%Rākṣasas%} among men; it has been heard
<div n="lb">by us that the texts of morality cannot be understood
<div n="lb">solely by discussion or by one's own intellect; {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">has said that this is the opinion of {%Bṛhaspati;…%}
<div n="lb">in days of old {%Uśanas%} told the {%Daiteyas%} this truth, that
<div n="lb">scriptures are no scriptures if they cannot stand the test of
<div n="lb">reason;…the sin of killing a person is equal to the sin of
<div n="lb">not killing one that deserves to be killed. {%Indra%} has said
<div n="lb">that in times of distress the great duty of a king is chastising
<div n="lb">the wicked and protecting the good (XII, {@142@}).—§ 651:
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the merits of protecting suppliants.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} reminded of {%Śibi,%} etc., told the story (that purifies
<div n="lb">the heart from every sin) that {%Bhārgava%} (i.e. {%Rāma,%} PCR.)
<div n="lb">had recited to king {%Mucukunda,%} how a pigeon won success
<div n="lb">{%(siddhi),%} i.e. Kapota-lubdhaka-saṃvāda {%(b)%} (XII, {@143-@}
<div n="lb">{@149@}).—§ 652: Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about how
<div n="lb">a person can be purified after having committed sin from
<div n="lb">want of judgment, {%Bhīṣma%} related the old tale, applauded
<div n="lb">by Ṛ., of what the brahman {%Indrota Śaunaka%} said to
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya,%} i.e. Indrota-Pārīkṣitīya {%(b)%} (XII, {@150-@}
<div n="lb">{@152@}).—§ 653: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if he had ever seen or
<div n="lb">heard of any mortal restored to life after having succumbed
<div n="lb">to death, {%Bhīṣma%} related the story of the discourse between
<div n="lb">a vulture and a jackal as it had happened of old in the forest of
<div n="lb">{%Naimiṣa,%} i.e. Gṛdhra-gomāyu-saṃvāda {%(b)%} (XII, {@153@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 654: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Bhīṣma%} as to how a weak king
<div n="lb">who incurs the wrath of a powerful one should behave in the
<div n="lb">hour of danger. {%Bhīṣma%} told the story of the discourse
<div n="lb">between {%Pavana%} and the {%śālmali,%} who, having dared the
<div n="lb">Wind-god, saved himself by causing his branches to be lopped
<div n="lb">off: Pavana-śālmali-saṃvāda {%(b).%} “One should over-
<div n="lb">look the wrongs inflicted by a person of superior strength,
<div n="lb">and even consider them like the acts of a child, an idiot, or
<div n="lb">one that is blind or deaf. The eighteen {%akṣauhiṇīs%} were
<div n="lb">not equal in might to {%Arjuna%}” (XII, {@154—157@}).—§ 655:
<div n="lb">Covetousness is the cause of sin; it is not known in its real
<div n="lb">nature by D., G., As., M.-U., etc. (XII, {@158@}). Discourse
<div n="lb">on ignorance; it has its origin in covetousness; {%Janaka,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), acquired heaven in consequence of their having
<div n="lb">repressed covetousness (XII, {@159@}). The moral laws laid
<div n="lb">down by M.-ṛ. are many; the highest among them all is
<div n="lb">self-restraint; it surpasses charity and sacrifice and study
<div n="lb">of the {%Vedas%} (XII, {@160@}). Penance {%(tapas)%} is the root of
<div n="lb">everything; by penance {%Prajāpati%} created the universe,
<div n="lb">etc., and Ṛ. acquired the {%Vedas%} and acquired their
<div n="lb">sixfold divine attributes {%(aiśvaryaṃ);%} renunciation {%(saṃ-%}
<div n="lb">{%nyāsaḥ)%} constitutes the highest penance (XII, {@161@}).
<div n="lb">Discourse on Truth and its indications; it is applauded by
<div n="lb">brahmans, Ṛ., and P.; it is {%yoga,%} it is {%Brahmán,%} sacrifice,
<div n="lb">etc.; it has been found to weigh heavier than 1,000 horse-
<div n="lb">sacrifices (XII, {@162@}). Discourse on the thirteen vices that
<div n="lb">are powerful foes of all; all these thirteen faults stained
<div n="lb">the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (XII, {@163@}). The characteristics
<div n="lb">of malevolent persons (XII, {@164@}). How {%brahmans%} should
<div n="lb">be provided for. At the end of every year one should
<div n="lb">perform the {%Vaiśvānara%} sacrifice {%(iṣtiṃ Vaiśvānarīṃ).%}
<div n="lb">The practice of an act laid down in an alternative is not
<div n="lb">destructive of virtue; fearing death, V.-D., Sā., the {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">and M.-ṛ. make use of the alternative instead of the
[Page063-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">principal rule in seasons of distress. The five kinds of
<div n="lb">falsehood that are not sinful. The three sins that cannot be
<div n="lb">expiated. Acts that are never sinful (“{%amṛta,%} if extracted
<div n="lb">from poison, can be quaffed”). Different kinds of expiation
<div n="lb">for different kinds of sin (XII, {@165@}).—§ 656: Questioned
<div n="lb">by {%Nakula, Bhīṣma%} related Khaḍgotpattikathana (q.v.)
<div n="lb">(XII, {@166@}).—§ 657: When {%Bhīṣma%} became silent {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} returned home. {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} question to {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">and his own brothers about the three things ({%trivarga,%} i.e.
<div n="lb">virtue, wealth, and desire). {%Vidura%} assigned precedence to
<div n="lb">virtue. {%Arjuna%} assigned precedence to wealth (or profit).
<div n="lb">{%Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%} assigned the precedence to both wealth
<div n="lb">and virtue. {%Bhīmasena%} assigns precedence to desire (“it
<div n="lb">is from desire that Ṛ. devote themselves to penances”).
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} applauded withdrawal from the three things,
<div n="lb">recommending emancipation {%(mokṣa)%} (“we do not know,
<div n="lb">however, what emancipation is”) or extinction {%(nirvāṇa),%} and
<div n="lb">quoted {%Brahmán.%}—All of them were filled with delight and
<div n="lb">applauded {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who once more addressed {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">(XII, {@167@}).—§ 658: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with whom
<div n="lb">friendship is delightful, {%Bhīṣma,%} having also stated with whom
<div n="lb">friendship should be avoided, related an old story that had
<div n="lb">occurred in the country of the {%Mlecchas,%} that lies to the north,
<div n="lb">about an ungrateful person, i.e. Kṛtaghnopākhyāna {%(b).%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} observations on ingratitude (XII, {@168—173@}).
