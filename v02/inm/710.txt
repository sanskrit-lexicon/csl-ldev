[{@Āpaddharmaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
duties in cases of need,” the 89th of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.; cf. Āpaddharma). § 642: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired
of {%Bhīṣma%} what should be done by a weak and timid king,
as also by one that is in great distress. {%Bhīṣma's%} answer
recommending peace and even the surrender of territory.
The king should never surrender his person as long as he
can avoid doing so. If the invading enemy be righteous, the
assailed king should make peace; if otherwise, the assailed
should fight bravely and fall (XII, {@131@}). How a {%brahman%}
should subsist in times of calamity. {%Bhīṣma%} began his
exposition of the moral standard of unlucky times; in times
of calamity the king may take from the wicked and give it
to the good; at such times censurable acts do not become
censurable; the king should never oppress {%brahmans%}, even
at such times. Slander should be avoided. The tests
of righteousness; difficulty in finding the course of duty.
“Some regard ancient usage as the highest test of
righteousness; they that are in favour of the conduct of
{%Caṅkha%} towards {%Likhita%} do not hold this opinion” (XII,
{@132@}). How a king should fill his treasury. The king
[Page062-a+ 63]
should establish laws which he should never transgress
(XII, {@133@}). The two duties of a {%kṣattriya%} are the
acquisition of religious merit and of wealth. The advantages
of Power (XII, {@134@}).—§ 643: The old story of a robber
who having in this world been observant of restraint did
not meet with destruction in the next: <is>Kāyavya-carita</is> ({%b%})
(XII, {@135@}).—§ 644: What wealth should not be taken by
the king (XII, {@136@}).—§ 645: Who enjoy happiness:
<is>Śākulopākhyāna</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@137@}).—§ 646. How a king
should behave who is weak and threatened on all sides by
powerful foes: the old story of the mouse, the cat, the owl,
the mongoose, and the hunter, i.e. <is>Mārjāra-mūṣika-</is>
<is>saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}). The moral of the story (XII, {@138@}).—§ 647:
{%Bhīṣma%} related the conversation between the bird {%Pūjanī%}
and king {%Brahmadatta%}, i.e. <is>Brahmadatta-Pūjanī-saṃvāda</is>
({%b%}) (XII, {@139@}).—§ 648: How a king should behave when
there is a general decadence of righteousness: the old story
of the discourse between {%Bhāradvāja%} and king {%Śatruñjaya%},
i.e. <is>Kaṇikopadeśa</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@140@}).—§ 649: How a
{%brahman%} should live when there is terrible distress around.
{%Bhīṣma%} said that the {%Kṛta%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), are all dependent on the
king's conduct, citing the old story of the discourse between
{%Viśvāmitra%} and the {%Cāṇḍāla%} in a hamlet inhabited by {%Cāṇḍālas%}.
Towards the end of {%Tretā%} and the beginning of {%Dvāpara%}
a frightful drought occurred extending over twelve years;
the planet {%Bṛhaspati%} began to move in a retrograde course,
and {%Soma%} receded towards the south, etc. (description); the
{%brahmans%} abstained from sacrifices and recitations of the {%Vedas%},
and no longer uttered {%vaṣaṭs%}, etc.; the very {%Ṛṣis%}, giving
up their vows, began to wander hither and thither. M.-ṛ.
{%Viśvāmitra%}, leaving his wife and son, wandered fireless and
homeless, and regardless of food, clean and unclean. One
day he came upon a hamlet, in the midst of a forest,
inhabited by cruel hunters, etc. (description of a {%Cāṇḍāla%}
hamlet). {%Viśvāmitra%}, in rage of hunger, wanted to steal
a dog's haunch (“theft is allowable in a season of distress
even for an eminent person;…in the first place one
should steal from a low person…”). He was discovered
and harshly addressed by the owner; but when the {%Cāṇḍāla%}
learned who he was he addressed him respectfully, and
dissuaded him from eating dog's meat, as the dog is less
clean than a jackal, and the haunch of a dog is much
worse than other parts of his body; “only the five kinds
of five-clawed animals are clean food for {%brahmans%} and
{%kṣattriyas%} and {%vaiśyas%}, as laid down in the scriptures”
({%yathāśāstraṃ). Viśvāmitra%} said that it is the duty of the
{%brahmans%} to behave like {%Agni%} (as it is the duty of the
{%kṣattriyas%} to behave like {%Indra%}), that the {%Vedas%} are fire,
and that fire at times becomes a consumer of everything;
“life is better than death; if living one may acquire
virtue”; he mentioned that {%Agastya%}, when hungry, ate up
the {%Asura Vātāpi%} (“a man who is a Ṛṣi cannot do what
is sinful”). Notwithstanding the warnings of the {%Cāṇḍāla%},
{%Viśvamitra%} took away that haunch of dog's meat into
the woods and wished to eat it with his wife, having
gratified the gods and the {%Pitṛs%}; igniting a fire according to
the {%Brāhma%} rites and cooking a {%caru%} according to the
{%Aindrāgneya%} rites, dividing the {%caru%} into due portions, he
invoked the gods, including {%Indra%}. Meanwhile {%Indra%} began to
pour rain copiously. {%Viśvāmitra%}, having completed the rites,
himself ate that meat. Afterwards he destroyed all his sins
by his penances and acquired the most wonderful success
(XII, {@141@}).—§ 650: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was distressed at the
[Page062-b+ 63]
possibility of such acts of impiety being mentioned as a duty.
{%Bhīṣma%} said that kings should gather wisdom from various
sources, and not from the {%Vedas%} alone. Those who blame
the injunctions of the scriptures, etc., are hucksters in
learning and {%Rākṣasas%} among men; it has been heard
by us that the texts of morality cannot be understood
solely by discussion or by one's own intellect; {%Indra%}
has said that this is the opinion of {%Bṛhaspati;…%}
in days of old {%Uśanas%} told the {%Daiteyas%} this truth, that
scriptures are no scriptures if they cannot stand the test of
reason;…the sin of killing a person is equal to the sin of
not killing one that deserves to be killed. {%Indra%} has said
that in times of distress the great duty of a king is chastising
the wicked and protecting the good (XII, {@142@}).—§ 651:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the merits of protecting suppliants.
{%Bhīṣma%}, reminded of {%Śibi%}, etc., told the story (that purifies
the heart from every sin) that {%Bhārgava%} (i.e. {%Rāma%}, PCR.)
had recited to king {%Mucukunda%}, how a pigeon won success
({%siddhi%}), i.e. <is>Kapota-lubdhaka-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@143-@}
{@149@}).—§ 652: Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about how
a person can be purified after having committed sin from
want of judgment, {%Bhīṣma%} related the old tale, applauded
by Ṛ., of what the brahman {%Indrota Śaunaka%} said to
{%Janamejaya%}, i.e. <is>Indrota-Pārīkṣitīya</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@150-@}
{@152@}).—§ 653: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if he had ever seen or
heard of any mortal restored to life after having succumbed
to death, {%Bhīṣma%} related the story of the discourse between
a vulture and a jackal as it had happened of old in the forest of
{%Naimiṣa%}, i.e. <is>Gṛdhra-gomāyu-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@153@}).—
§ 654: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Bhīṣma%} as to how a weak king
who incurs the wrath of a powerful one should behave in the
hour of danger. {%Bhīṣma%} told the story of the discourse
between {%Pavana%} and the {%śālmali%}, who, having dared the
Wind-god, saved himself by causing his branches to be lopped
off: <is>Pavana-śālmali-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}). “One should over-
look the wrongs inflicted by a person of superior strength,
and even consider them like the acts of a child, an idiot, or
one that is blind or deaf. The eighteen {%akṣauhiṇīs%} were
not equal in might to {%Arjuna%}” (XII, {@154—157@}).—§ 655:
Covetousness is the cause of sin; it is not known in its real
nature by D., G., As., M.-U., etc. (XII, {@158@}). Discourse
on ignorance; it has its origin in covetousness; {%Janaka%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), acquired heaven in consequence of their having
repressed covetousness (XII, {@159@}). The moral laws laid
down by M.-ṛ. are many; the highest among them all is
self-restraint; it surpasses charity and sacrifice and study
of the {%Vedas%} (XII, {@160@}). Penance ({%tapas%}) is the root of
everything; by penance {%Prajāpati%} created the universe,
etc., and Ṛ. acquired the {%Vedas%} and acquired their
sixfold divine attributes ({%aiśvaryaṃ%}); renunciation ({%saṃ-%}
{%nyāsaḥ%}) constitutes the highest penance (XII, {@161@}).
Discourse on Truth and its indications; it is applauded by
brahmans, Ṛ., and P.; it is {%yoga%}, it is {%Brahmán%}, sacrifice,
etc.; it has been found to weigh heavier than 1,000 horse-
sacrifices (XII, {@162@}). Discourse on the thirteen vices that
are powerful foes of all; all these thirteen faults stained
the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (XII, {@163@}). The characteristics
of malevolent persons (XII, {@164@}). How {%brahmans%} should
be provided for. At the end of every year one should
perform the {%Vaiśvānara%} sacrifice ({%iṣtiṃ Vaiśvānarīṃ%}).
The practice of an act laid down in an alternative is not
destructive of virtue; fearing death, V.-D., Sā., the {%brahmans%},
and M.-ṛ. make use of the alternative instead of the
[Page063-a+ 63]
principal rule in seasons of distress. The five kinds of
falsehood that are not sinful. The three sins that cannot be
expiated. Acts that are never sinful (“{%amṛta%}, if extracted
from poison, can be quaffed”). Different kinds of expiation
for different kinds of sin (XII, {@165@}).—§ 656: Questioned
by {%Nakula, Bhīṣma%} related <is>Khaḍgotpattikathana</is> (q.v.)
(XII, {@166@}).—§ 657: When {%Bhīṣma%} became silent {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} returned home. {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} question to {%Vidura%}
and his own brothers about the three things ({%trivarga%}, i.e.
virtue, wealth, and desire). {%Vidura%} assigned precedence to
virtue. {%Arjuna%} assigned precedence to wealth (or profit).
{%Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%} assigned the precedence to both wealth
and virtue. {%Bhīmasena%} assigns precedence to desire (“it
is from desire that Ṛ. devote themselves to penances”).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} applauded withdrawal from the three things,
recommending emancipation ({%mokṣa%}) (“we do not know,
however, what emancipation is”) or extinction ({%nirvāṇa%}), and
quoted {%Brahmán%}.—All of them were filled with delight and
applauded {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who once more addressed {%Bhīṣma%}
(XII, {@167@}).—§ 658: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with whom
friendship is delightful, {%Bhīṣma%}, having also stated with whom
friendship should be avoided, related an old story that had
occurred in the country of the {%Mlecchas%}, that lies to the north,
about an ungrateful person, i.e. <is>Kṛtaghnopākhyāna</is> ({%b%}).
{%Bhīṣma's%} observations on ingratitude (XII, {@168—173@}).
