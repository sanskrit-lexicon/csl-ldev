{@Kalmāṣapāda,@}¦ Saudāsa (also named Mitrasaha), king of
<div n="lb">Ayodhyā and husband of Madayantī. § 188 (Madayantī):
[Page377-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">I, {@122,@} 4737 (being himself unable to beget children
<div n="lb">{%K.%} urged Madayantī to go to Vasiṣṭha, who begat Aśmaka on
<div n="lb">her, cf. § 225).—§ 224 (Vāsiṣṭha): The rājarṣi of the
<div n="lb">race of {%Ikṣvāku Kalmāṣapāda%} (whose sacrifices {%Viśvāmitra%}
<div n="lb">had desired to perform) once when hunting met the viprarṣi
<div n="lb">{%Śaktri,%} the eldest of Vasiṣṭha's 100 sons, and ordered
<div n="lb">him to stand out of his way, and as {%Śaktri%} did not yield
<div n="lb">{%K.%} struck him with his whip. {%Śaktri%} then cursed him, saying:
<div n="lb">“From this day thou shalt be a {%rākṣasa,%} eating human
<div n="lb">flesh.” The king began humbly to propitiate the ṛṣi, but
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra%} (between whom and Vasiṣṭha there was a dispute
<div n="lb">about {%K.,%} whom they both wanted as their yājya) passed before
<div n="lb">them without being seen, and caused a {%rākṣasa%} named {%Kiṅkara%}
<div n="lb">to enter the king. {%Viśvāmitra%} then went away. At this time
<div n="lb">a hungry brahman beheld in the wood {%K.,%} who was terribly
<div n="lb">afflicted by the {%rākṣasa,%} and asked the king for some food
<div n="lb">with meat. {%K.%} asked him to stay there for a moment, and
<div n="lb">having roved for some time at pleasure at last entered his
<div n="lb">inner apartments. When waking at midnight and remembering
<div n="lb">his promise, he summoned his cook, and as the cook did not
<div n="lb">find any meat {%K.%} said: “Feed him with human flesh.”
<div n="lb">The cook then took human flesh from the place where the
<div n="lb">executioners were, and offered it to the hungry brahman.
<div n="lb">Seeing with his spiritual power of vision {%(siddha-cakṣuṣā)%}
<div n="lb">what kind of food it was, the brahman in anger said that the
<div n="lb">king himself should take a fancy to such food and wander
<div n="lb">over all the earth alarming all creatures. The curse on the
<div n="lb">king, being thus repeated a second time, became very strong,
<div n="lb">and possessed by the {%rākṣasa%} the king lost all his senses.
<div n="lb">A while after {%K.,%} beholding {%Śaktri,%} in order to revenge him-
<div n="lb">self for the curse slew him and ate him up. And {%Viśvāmitra%}
<div n="lb">caused that {%rākṣasa%} also to devour the other sons of Vasiṣṭha:
