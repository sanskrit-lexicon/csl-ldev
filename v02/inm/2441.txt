{@Śāntanūpākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to Śāntanu”).
<div n="lb">§ 162 (Sambhav.): The {%rājarṣi Pratīpa%} spent many years in
<div n="lb">ascetic penances at the source of {%Gaṅgā.%} She sat upon his
<div n="lb">right thigh and wished him to be her husband. He replied
<div n="lb">that the left lap was for the wife, but the right for the
<div n="lb">daughters and daughters-in-law; therefore he accepted her
<div n="lb">for his son, to which {%Gaṅgā%} consented on the condition that
<div n="lb">his son should not be able to judge of the propriety of her
<div n="lb">acts. Then {%Pratīpa,%} along with his wife, engaged in ascetic
<div n="lb">austerities from desire of offspring, and when they had grown
<div n="lb">old, {%Mahābhiṣa%} (v. Mahābhiṣop.) was born as a son to them
<div n="lb">and was called {%Śāntanu,%} because his father had controlled
<div n="lb">his passion ({%śāntasya santānaḥ,%} v. 3882, cf. 3799). When
<div n="lb">{%Śāntanu%} had grown to become a youth, {%Pratīpa%} told him about
<div n="lb">his appointment with the celestial damsel, installed him upon
<div n="lb">the throne, and retired into the woods. {%Śāntanu,%} who was
<div n="lb">addicted to hunting, one day came upon the banks of {%Gaṅgā,%}
<div n="lb">frequented by {%Siddhas%} and {%Cāraṇas,%} and there he requested
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā,%} in the form of a lovely maiden, to become his wife
<div n="lb">(I, {@97@}). (For continuation v. Bhīṣmotpatti.)
