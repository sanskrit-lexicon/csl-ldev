<div n="lb">in battle; the vaiśyas and the śūdras joined the brahmans.
<div n="lb">In the battles, however, the three castes repeatedly broke down,
<div n="lb">while the kṣatriyas, though alone, vanquished their large
<div n="lb">army because they obeyed the commands of only one person,
<div n="lb">while the other three castes acted each according to his
<div n="lb">individual understanding. The brahmans then appointed one
<div n="lb">among themselves as their commander, and thus succeeded
<div n="lb">in vanquishing the kṣatriyas: V, {@156,@} 5281.—§ 595
