had come to Vaivasvata; Dharmarāja (i.e. Yama) himself had
dwelt there; there all the rivers take their rise ({%samudbhedaḥ%})
and {%Mahādeva%} is always present; there the Pāṇḍavas per-
formed {%cāturmāsya%} sacrifices together with the great {%ṛṣiyajña%}

[Page166-a+ 63]
banian”), the imperishable sacrificial platform of the gods,

various sacred subjects, and the learned and pious Śamatha,
who lived in celibacy ({%kaumāraṃ vratam āṣṭhitaḥ%}), told them
