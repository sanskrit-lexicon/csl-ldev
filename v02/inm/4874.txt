{@[Jayadrathavimokṣaṇaparvan]@}¦ (“the setting free
of Jayadratha,” the 47th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
(Cf. Jayadrathavimokṣaṇa.) § 523 (cf. Draupadīhar.):
{%Bhīma%} seized {%Jayadratha%} by the hair, and holding him high
up in the air thrust him on the ground, etc., and regretted
that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had forbidden to kill him. He then with
his arrow shaved {%Jayadratha's%} head, leaving only five tufts
of hair, and made him promise to say in public assemblies,
“I am the slave of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.” They then bound him
and thrust him into the chariot; then they drove towards the
hermitage and presented him to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Yudhiṣṭhira%}
and {%Draupadī%} set him free with his army. § 524: {%Jayadratha%}
went to {%Gaṅgādvāra%}, and pleased {%Śiva%} so that he deigned
to accept his offerings in person and granted him a boon.
{%Jayadratha%} asked that he might be able to defeat in battle all
the five {%Pāṇḍavas%} on their chariots. This {%Śiva%} declared to be
impossible, as {%Arjuna (b%}) was invincible, and was protected
by {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who was {%Viṣṇu (c). Śiva%} then briefly reminded
{%Jayadratha%} of four incarnations of {%Viṣṇu (d%}). “Thou shalt,
however, be able to vanquish for a single day only the rest
of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} forces and the four {%Pāṇḍavas%}, but not
{%Arjuna%}.” Then {%Śiva%} vanished with {%Umā, Jayadratha%}
returned home, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} continued to dwell in
{%Kāmyaka%} (III, {@272@}).
