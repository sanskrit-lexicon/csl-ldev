{@[Jayadrathavimokṣaṇaparvan]@}¦ (“the setting free
<div n="lb">of Jayadratha,” the 47th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
<div n="lb">(Cf. Jayadrathavimokṣaṇa.) § 523 (cf. Draupadīhar.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} seized {%Jayadratha%} by the hair, and holding him high
<div n="lb">up in the air thrust him on the ground, etc., and regretted
<div n="lb">that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had forbidden to kill him. He then with
<div n="lb">his arrow shaved {%Jayadratha's%} head, leaving only five tufts
<div n="lb">of hair, and made him promise to say in public assemblies,
<div n="lb">“I am the slave of the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}” They then bound him
<div n="lb">and thrust him into the chariot; then they drove towards the
<div n="lb">hermitage and presented him to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">and {%Draupadī%} set him free with his army. § 524: {%Jayadratha%}
<div n="lb">went to {%Gaṅgādvāra,%} and pleased {%Śiva%} so that he deigned
<div n="lb">to accept his offerings in person and granted him a boon.
<div n="lb">{%Jayadratha%} asked that he might be able to defeat in battle all
<div n="lb">the five {%Pāṇḍavas%} on their chariots. This {%Śiva%} declared to be
<div n="lb">impossible, as {%Arjuna (b)%} was invincible, and was protected
<div n="lb">by {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who was {%Viṣṇu (c). Śiva%} then briefly reminded
<div n="lb">{%Jayadratha%} of four incarnations of {%Viṣṇu (d).%} “Thou shalt,
<div n="lb">however, be able to vanquish for a single day only the rest
<div n="lb">of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} forces and the four {%Pāṇḍavas,%} but not
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna.%}” Then {%Śiva%} vanished with {%Umā, Jayadratha%}
<div n="lb">returned home, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} continued to dwell in
<div n="lb">{%Kāmyaka%} (III, {@272@}).
