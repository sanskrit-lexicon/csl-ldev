[{@Śakra-Namuci-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}],¦ “the discourse between
Indra and Namuci.” § 672{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): When the
{%Asura Namuci%}, who was conversant with the birth and death
of all creatures, was sitting, divested of prosperity but un-
troubled at heart, bound with cords, brought under the sway
of his foes, etc., {%Indra%} asked him if he grieved or passed his
days cheerfully. {%Namuci%} answers that he does not grieve,
and explains why, citing {%Gautama%} [the spouse of Ahalyā]
(XII, {@226@}).
