[{@Anugītāparvan@}]¦ (“the section containing the repetition
of the Bhagavadgītā,”) the 94th of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.; cf. Anugītā). § 782: {%Janamejaya%} said: When
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}, after having slain their enemies, dwelt
there in the palace, what conversation took place between
them? {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Arjuna%}, having recovered his
kingdom, spent his time joyously in the company of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
in that beautiful palace. There they repaired to a particular
part of the palace with their friends and relatives. {%Arjuna%}
asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to repeat to him what he had taught him before
the battle [i.e. Bhagavadgītā], especially as he would soon
repair to {%Dvārakā. Kṛṣṇa%} is discontented because {%Arjuna%}
cannot remember it; he would now, however, recite an old
story upon the same topic. “There came a brahman from
{%Svargaloka%} and was honoured by us; hear what he said, asked
by us.” The brahman said: There came a brahman {%Kāśyapa%},
possessed of penance, etc., to some other brahman, who had
become conversant with all the authorities on religion, etc.,
crowned with ascetic success ({%siddhaṃ%}), able to move everywhere
at will ({%kramamāṇaṃ%}), knowing the science of disappearing
at will, roving with invisible {%Siddhas%} and celestial musicians
({%?cakradharaiḥ%}, PCR.); {%Kāśyapa%} honoured him as his {%guru%},
and the brahman spoke to him about transmigration, comparing
his own example; at last he had renounced the world and
attained to his present success, and should not have to return
to this world, but would come to “{%Bráhman's%} eternal abode”;
he promised to answer {%Kāśyapa's%} questions (XIV, {@16@}).
{%Kṛṣṇa%} said: Asked by {%Kāśyapa%}, the brahman discoursed on
how {%Jīva%} casts off and then attains to a body, how Emanci-
pation is achieved, and where acts do exist when {%Jīva%} becomes
divested of body, etc.; how death is brought about; the
happiness and misery of {%Jīva%} determined by acts (XIV, {@17@});
how {%Jīva%} enters the womb; {%Brahmán%} first formed a body
of his own, then he created {%Pradhāna%}, the material cause
({%prakṛtiṃ%}) of all embodied creatures; indifference to pleasure
and pain leads to the Supreme Seat (XIV, {@18@}); who is said
to be emancipated; on the science of {%yoga%}; how {%Jīva%} attains to
emancipation.—{%Kṛṣṇa%} said: Then the brahman disappeared;
this discourse was, in fact, what thou (Arjuna) heardst on
thy car; this is a great mystery even to the gods; at no
time or place has this been heard by man in this world; by
adhering to this religion, even those who are of sinful birth,
women, {%vaiśyas%}, and {%śūdras%}, attain to the highest goal; {%yoga%}
[Page057-b+ 63]
takes place in his case who devotes himself to its constant
practice ({%nityayuktasya%}) for a period of six months (XIV, {@19@}).
In this connection the ancient narrative of a discourse between
a married couple is cited: [<is>Brāhmaṇagītā</is>] ({%b%}) (XIV,
{@20—34@}). Asked by {%Arjuna%} about {%Bráhman, Kṛṣṇa%} recited
the old story of the discourse between a preceptor and his
disciple on this subject: <is>Guruśiṣyasaṃvāda</is> ({%g%}). Asked
by {%Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa%} said that he is the preceptor, and the
mind his pupil; “formerly, when the hour of battle came,
this very religion was declared by me; and now, it is long
since I saw my father; I wish to see him again with thy
leave.”—{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Arjuna%} replied: “We shall go
to-day from this town to {%Hāstinapura%} and inform {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}” (XIV, {@35—51@}).—§ 783: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Kṛṣṇa%}
caused {%Dāruka%} to yoke his car, and then set out for {%Hāstina-%}
{%pura%} with {%Arjuna. Arjuna%} praised {%Kṛṣṇa%}, “the soul of the
universe, etc.,” as he had learned from {%Nārada%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>),
saying that {%Śrī%} is always established in him, and mentioning
{%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>). Arrived at {%Hāstinapura%}, they entered
the palace of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, where they saw {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%} passed the night in the apartments of
{%Arjuna%}. At morning they proceeded to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who
sat with his ministers; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} mentioned {%Vasudeva%} (his
maternal uncle), etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), and asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to think of {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), and to come back to his horse-sacrifice.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} took no gifts from him, took leave of {%Kuntī%} (his
maternal aunt), {%Vidura%}, etc., and then set out from {%Hāstina-%}
{%pura%} with {%Subhadrā%} on the car, accompanied by {%Arjuna%},
{%Sātyaki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); then, having caused them to return, he
with {%Dāruka%} and {%Sātyaki%} proceeded to the city of the {%Ānarttas%}
(XIV, {@52@}).—§ 784: {%Arjuna%} repeatedly embraced {%Kṛṣṇa%},
etc. (omens). As he came to the desert, he beheld {%Utaṅka%}
({%b%}) (XIV, {@53—58@}).—§ 785: {%Janamejaya%} said: What did
{%Kṛṣṇa%} next do, after having granted that boon to {%Utaṅka?%}
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Having granted that boon to {%Utaṅka%},
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, accompanied by {%Sātyaki%}, proceeded to {%Dvārakā%} on
his car, passing many lakes and rivers and forests and hills.
He came there when the festival of {%Raivataka%} had begun;
the {%Raivataka%} hill shone with great splendour (description;
the trees looked like the {%kalpa%}-trees of {%Indra's%} garden; the
mountain looked like {%Meru%}); gifts were ceaselessly being
made to the distressed, or blind, or helpless. {%Kṛṣṇa%} re-
counted the incidents of the great battle to his father (XIV,
{@59@}). {%Vasudeva%} said: Tell me about the battle between
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Vaiśampāyana%} said:
{%Kṛṣṇa%} narrated, also in the presence of his mother, how
the {%Kaurava%} heroes had been slain in battle. {%Kṛṣṇa's%}
narrative of the battle (<lang n="greek">β</lang>). {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: The
{%Vṛṣṇis%} became filled with grief (XIV, {@60@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
had passed by the slaughter of {%Abhimanyu; Subhadrā%}
noticed it and fell down; {%Vasudeva%} then also fell down, and
then asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to tell the whole truth (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
consoled him (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (XIV, {@61@}). {%Vasudeva%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>),
made excellent obsequial offerings to {%Abhimanyu%}, and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
fed six millions of brahmans and gave away heaps of gold, etc.
Also the {%Pāṇḍavas%} at {%Hāstinapura%} were filled with grief for
{%Abhimanyu; Uttarā%} totally abstained from all food, and her
relatives feared for her embryo; {%Vyāsa%} came and predicted to
{%Pṛthā, Uttarā, Arjuna%}, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, that the son of
{%Uttarā%} would become a great prince, through the influence
of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Vyāsa; Abhimanyu%} had gone to the regions of
the gods. {%Arjuna%} became cheerful; the child in {%Uttarā's%}
womb grew like the moon in the bright fortnight; {%Vyāsa%}
[Page058-a+ 63]
urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to perform the horse-sacrifice, and
disappeared; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} set his mind on the journey for
bringing wealth (XIV, {@62@}). {%Janamejaya%} said: Having
heard these words of {%Vyāsa%}, what steps were taken by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira?%}—how did he succeed in obtaining the wealth
of {%Marutta? Vaiśampāyana%} said: Having heard the words
of {%Vyāsa, Yudhiṣṭhira%} summoned all his brothers, reminding
them of the words of {%Vyāsa, Bhīṣma%}, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} about
{%Marutta's%} gold; {%Bhīmasena%} was of his opinion, saying that
they must worship {%Śiva%} and his followers; then the K.s, who
protected the treasures, would certainly yield; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
was pleased; the others, headed by {%Arjuna%}, approved. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} ordered their army to march under the {%nakṣatra%}
{%Dhruva%} (i.e. {%Rohiṇī%}, Nīl.), and on the day {%Dhruva%} (i.e. Sunday,
Nīl.), and set out, having worshipped {%Śiva%} with {%modakas%},
frumenty, and cakes of meat, taking leave of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), and keeping {%Yuyutsu%} in the capital (XIV, {@63@}).
Then they set out (description); arrived at the spot, they
pitched their camp, placing the brahmans and {%Āgniveśya%}
(i.e. {%Dhaumya%}, Nīl.) in the van; then the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the
other kings, and the brahmans and priests, having performed
propitiatory rites, and placing the king and his ministers in
the middle, caused the camp to be pitched by laying out six
roads and nine divisions; king {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused a separate
encampment to be made for the infuriated elephants; the
brahmans declared this very day to be an auspicious one;
on this day they would live upon water alone, and they
should all fast; they passed the night on beds of {%kuśa-%}
grass, listening to the discourses of the learned brahmans.
When the cloudless morning came, the brahmans told {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} (XIV, {@64@}) to make offerings to {%Śiva. Dhaumya%}
performed the rites (description), and gave {%bali%} to the servants
of {%Śiva%}; offerings were next made to {%Kubera, Maṇibhadra%},
and to the other Y. and lords of Bh. (with {%kṛśaras%}, and
meat, and {%nivāpas%} mixed with sesame seeds); the king gave
thousands of cows to the brahmans; then he ordered {%bali%}
for the night-wandering Bh. Then the king, placing {%Vyāsa%}
ahead, proceeded to the spot where the treasure was, once
more worshipping {%Kubera%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>). Numerous costly
vessels were dug out and placed in wooden chests, etc.;
there were 60,000 camels, 120,000 horses, and 100,000
elephants, etc. (description). Once more worshipping {%Śiva%},
they set out for {%Hāstinapura%} with the permission of {%Vyāsa%},
and placing {%Dhaumya%} in the van, marched a {%goyuta%} (four
miles, PCR.) every day (XIV, {@65@}). Meanwhile, {%Kṛṣṇa%}
with {%Pradyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), came to see {%Draupadī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), and
was received by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>). {%Uttarā%} gave birth
to {%Parikṣit%}, who was born without life, afflicted with the
{%Brāhma%} weapon; {%Kuntī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>), lamented, and {%Kuntī%} asked
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, who came with {%Yuyudhāna%}, to revive him and rescue
{%Uttarā%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), reminding him that {%Abhimanyu%} had said to
{%Uttarā%} that her son would learn the art of weapons, etc., by
the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas; Kṛṣṇa%} comforted her (XIV, {@66@}).
Then {%Subhadrā%} lamented (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>) (XIV, {@67@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} entered the
lying-in room (description; with articles destructive of Rā.);
{%Uttarā%} lamented (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>) (XIV, {@68@}), and so did {%Kuntī%}, etc.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} touched water and withdrew the {%Brāhma%} weapon,
and “as {%Kaṃsa%} and {%Keśin%} have rightly been slain by me, etc.”
({%tena satyena%}), he revived the child (XIV, {@69@}). {%Parikṣit%}
illumined the lying-in room with his energy; Rā. fled or
were destroyed; a voice in the sky applauded {%Kṛṣṇa%};
the {%Brāhma%} weapon returned to {%Brahmán%}; at the command
of {%Kṛṣṇa%} the brahmans were made to utter benedictions;
[Page058-b+ 63]
{%Kuntī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>), were glad and praised {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and so did
wrestlers, actors, astrologers, etc.; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and the other
{%Vṛṣṇi%} chiefs made precious gifts to the child, whom {%Kṛṣṇa%}
called {%Parikṣit%} (etymology). When he was a month old,
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} came back with the wealth, and were received
by those {%Vṛṣṇis%} and the citizens; {%Vidura%} ordered various
kinds of worship to be offered to the gods in their temples,
etc.; with dancers and singers, the city resembled the mansion
of {%Kubera%}, etc. (description) (XIV, {@70@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} and his
ministers went out to see the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, who entered the city
together with the {%Vṛṣṇis%}, and worshipped {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">π</lang>), and also {%Kṛṣṇa%}, having heard how he had revived
{%Parikṣit%}; after a few days {%Vyāsa%} came and was worshipped
by the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%}, and he permitted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
perform the horse-sacrifice, “a purifier of all sinners.” {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to perform the sacrifice; but {%Kṛṣṇa%} told
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to appoint them to whatever tasks he likes;
“when thou sacrificest, {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>), will be sacri-
ficing” (XIV, {@71@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Vyāsa%} to cause him
to be initiated; {%Vyāsa%} said that he and {%Paila%} and {%Yājñavalkya%}
would perform the rites; the initiation would be performed
on the day of full moon in the month of {%Caitra%}; “let {%sūtas%}
and brahmans well versed in the science of horses select
a worthy horse”; all the articles were duly procured; {%Vyāsa%}
ordained that the {%sphya%} and the {%kūrca%} should be made of
gold; “let the horse be loosened to-day.” Asked by {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} ordained that {%Arjuna%} should protect the horse;
{%Bhīmasena%} the kingdom aided by {%Nakula; Sahadeva%} should
attend to all the relatives invited (with the permission of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Arjuna%} to spare all hostile
kings as much as possible and to invite them to the horse-
sacrifice (XIV, {@72@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was initiated by the {%Ṛtvijs%}
(description); the horse was let loose. {%Arjuna%} with {%Gāṇḍīva%}
followed the horse; all {%Hāstinapura%} came out wanting to
behold him; a disciple of {%Yājñavalkya%} followed him in order
to perform auspicious rites for him; and also many brahmans
and {%kṣattriyas%}. During the horse's wanderings many great
and wonderful battles were fought; the horse wandered over
the whole earth; from the north it turned to the east:
kings in myriads fought against {%Arjuna%} because they had lost
their kinsmen on the field of {%Kurukṣetra%}, and innumerable
{%Kirātas, Yavanas, Mlecchas%}, and {%Āryas%}; “I shall narrate
only the principal battles” (XIV, {@73@}). The {%Trigartas%} (the
sons and grandsons of the slain) attacked {%Arjuna%}, who in vain
asked them to forbear; the {%Trigarta%} king {%Sūryavarman &%}
{%Arjuna%}, who slew {%Sūryavarman's%} younger brother {%Ketuvarman%};
{%Dhṛtavarman & Arjuna%}, who was wounded in his hand and
let fall {%Gāṇḍīva%}, but took it up again and slew eighteen
warriors; the {%Trigartas%} fled and accepted {%Arjuna's%} dominion
(XIV, {@74@}). In {%Prāgjyotiṣa, Bhagadatta's%} son king {%Vajra-%}
{%datta%} (description) attacked {%Arjuna%} on his elephant, but, after
a fierce battle (XIV, {@75@}) lasting three days, he on the fourth
day had his elephant slain, and he promised to come to the
horse-sacrifice (XIV, {@76@}). Recollecting {%Jayadratha%}, the
{%Saindhavas%}, mounted on cars, attacked {%Arjuna%}, who was on
foot; a terrible wind began to blow, and {%Rāhu%} swallowed up
both the sun and the moon at the same time, etc.; {%Kailāsa%}
began to tremble; the seven Ṛ. and the other Ṛ. of heaven
breathed hot sighs; Indra's bow appeared in the sky, and clouds
poured flesh and blood on the earth; {%Gāṇḍīva%} fell down; the
gods, D.-ṛ., {%Saptarṣis%}, and B.-ṛ. recited ({%jepuḥ%}) “victory” to
{%Arjuna%}, who once more used his bow; the {%Saindhavas%} fled
(XIV, {@77@}), but once more rallied; {%Arjuna%} urged them to
[Page059-a+ 63]
surrender, but in vain, because they only thought of {%Jayadratha%};
many were slain; then {%Duḥśalā%}, taking her grandson, the son
of {%Suratha%} [the son of {%Jayadratha%}], in her arms, repaired to
{%Arjuna; Arjuna%} dropped his bow and asked about {%Suratha%};
she said that he had died from sorrow when he heard of
{%Arjuna's%} arrival; she drew a parallel between {%Suratha's%}
[orphan] son and {%Abhimanyu's%} [orphan] son {%Parikṣit%}.
Recollecting {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Gāndhārī%}, and censuring
{%kṣattriya%} practices and {%Duryodhana, Arjuna%} consoled and
embraced her; {%Duḥśalā%} asked her warriors to desist, and
returned home. At last the horse arrived at {%Maṇipūra%}
(XIV, {@78@}), where {%Babhruvāhana, Arjuna's%} son by {%Citrāṅ-%}
{%gadā%}, humbly approached {%Arjuna%}, together with a number
of brahmans, bringing treasure in his van; {%Arjuna%} angrily
blamed him for having neglected his duty as a {%kṣattriya%}.
{%Ulūpī%} came from within the earth and beheld her [step-]son
standing cheerless, and incited him to fight {%Arjuna%}, which
he did (description of his car); he even caused the sacrificial
horse to be seized; gravely wounded, {%Arjuna%} praised his son
highly; he cut off his standard, which was set with gold and
resembled a golden palmyra, and then he slew his steeds; at
last {%Arjuna%} fell down in a swoon, and so did {%Babhruvāhana%};
{%Citrāṅgadā%} repaired to the battlefield weeping piteously
(XIV, {@79@}); she indulged in copious lamentations, lost her
senses, and fell down on the earth; regaining consciousness
and seeing {%Ulūpī%}, she blamed her for having brought about
{%Arjuna's%} slaughter by {%Babhruvāhana%}, and asked her to revive
him; “I do not grieve for my slain son, I only grieve for my
husband”; otherwise she would sit in {%prāya%} and die; the
horse she had set free. Regaining consciousness {%Babhruvāhana%}
lamented piteously, saying that now he had slain his father, he
would wander over the earth, covering himself with his father's
skin, or with the two halves of his head, as an expiation, or
else he would die; he took an oath (touching water) that, if
{%Arjuna%} was not revived, he would emaciate his own body,
sitting on the field of battle; “I shall without doubt have to
sink into hell; he who has slain a heroic {%kṣattriya%} becomes
purified by making a gift of 100 cows; I, who have slain
my father, cannot be rescued.” {%Ulūpī%} thought of the gem
that has the virtue of reviving a dead man; the gem, thus
thought of, came there; she said that {%Arjuna%} had not been
vanquished by {%Babhruvāhana%}, but {%Ulūpī%} had exhibited this
illusion for the benefit of {%Arjuna%}. As soon as the prince
had placed the gem on the breast of {%Arjuna%} the latter
revived. {%Indra%} poured down celestial flowers, etc. {%Arjuna%}
wondered why the two ladies were present, and why every-
thing seemed to indicate grief, and asked {%Babhruvāhana%}
who told him to question {%Ulūpī%} (XIV, {@80@}). Asked by
{%Arjuna, Ulūpī%} recited the curse of the {%Vasus%} (approved by
{%Gaṅgā%}) because {%Arjuna%} had slain {%Bhīṣma%} in unfair fight
(while he was engaged with {%Śikhaṇḍin%} and had ceased to
fight); if {%Arjuna%} had died without having expiated his sin
he would have fallen into Hell; hearing the curse of the
{%Vasus, Ulūpī%} had consulted her father, who prevailed upon
the {%Vasus%} that {%Arjuna%} should be freed from their curses
when he had been slain by {%Babhruvāhana. Arjuna%} highly
approved of {%Ulūpī's%} action, and told {%Babhruvāhana%} to come
with his mother and counsellors and officers to the horse-
sacrifice; {%Babhruvāhana%} promised to come and to take upon
himself the task of distributing food among the brahmans
({%dvijātipariveśakaḥ%}). He asked {%Arjuna%} to pass the night in
the city with his two wives; but {%Arjuna%} was prevented by
his vow of following the horse; he took leave and proceeded
[Page059-b+ 63]
on his way (XIV, {@81@}). The horse, having wandered over
the whole earth, turned its face towards {%Hāstinapura%}. At
{%Rājagṛha%}, the {%Magadha%} king {%Meghasandhi%}, son of {%Sahadeva%},
attacked {%Arjuna%}, who was on foot, from his chariot;
{%Meghasandhi%} was worsted, but spared and told to come to the
horse-sacrifice. The horse then proceeded along the sea-coast
through the country of the {%Vaṅgas, Puṇḍras%}, and {%Kośalas%};
in these countries {%Arjuna%} vanquished innumerable {%Mleccha%}
armies (XIV, {@82@}). {%Arjuna%} proceeded towards the south.
The horse came to {%Cuktimatī%}, the beautiful city of the {%Cedis%}.
{%Śarabha%}, the son of {%Śiśupāla%}, fought {%Arjuna%}, and then
worshipped him. Then the horse came to the {%Kāśis, Aṅgas%},
{%Kośalas, Kirātas%}, and {%Taṅgaṇas%}; then to the {%Daśārṇas%},
whose ruler {%Citrāṅgada%} was vanquished by {%Arjuna%}; then
to the dominions of the {%Niṣāda%} king, the son of {%Ekalavya%},
who was vanquished after a furious battle; then towards the
southern ocean, where the {%Draviḍas, Andhras, Māhiṣakas%},
and {%Kolvagireyas%} (B. {%Kolla°%}) were subjugated; then to the
{%Surāṣṭras, Gokarṇa, Prabhāsa%}, and {%Dvāravatī%}, where the
{%Yādava%} youths were going to beat the horse, but were
forbidden by King {%Ugrasena%}, who came to {%Arjuna%} with
{%Vasudeva%}. Then the horse proceeded along the coast of the
western ocean to the prosperous country of the five rivers;
then to the {%Gāndhāras%}, where a fierce battle ensued with the
{%Gāndhāra%} king, the son of {%Śakuni%} (XIV, {@83@}), who wanted
to avenge the slaughter of {%Śakuni%}; many {%Gāndhāras%} were
slain; at last the king, disregarding {%Arjuna's%} peaceful advice,
fought alone; {%Arjuna%} shot off his headgear; then he and all
the {%Gāndhāras%} fled; the mother of the king and all the aged
ministers came out and forbade her son to fight; {%Arjuna%} said
he had spared him for the sake of {%Gāndhārī%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
and told him to come to the horse-sacrifice (XIV, {@84@}). The
horse then turned towards the road that led to {%Hāstinapura%}.
As these tidings reached the {%Kuru%} court through the intelli-
gence-bearers, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} rejoiced, and on the twelfth day
of the bright fortnight of {%Māgha%}, under a favourable con-
stellation, he summoned his brothers (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>), and caused {%Bhīma%}
to let learned brahmans select a beautiful spot for the sacri-
ficial compound (description). Then {%Bhīma%} sent messengers
to invite the kings of the earth; they brought gems, female
slaves, horses, and weapons. All the foremost brahmans also
came there with their disciples; likewise many dialecticians
disputing with each other. All was made of gold. One
hundred thousand brahmans were fed; many mountains of food,
many large tanks of curds, and many lakes of ghee were seen
there. The entire population of {%Jambudvīpa%} was collected
together (XIV, {@85@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} appointed {%Bhīmasena%} to
pay proper honours to the royal guests and to their attendants.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} came with the {%Vṛṣṇis, Baladeva%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%}
told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about {%Arjuna%} (having heard it from
a confidential agent of his in {%Dvārakā%}), that he had become
very much emaciated, and that he was near at hand; he had
warned against a carnage similar to that at the presenting of
the {%Arghya%}, and he had especially recommended {%Babhruvāhana%}
(XIV, {@86@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired of {%Kṛṣṇa%} why {%Arjuna%}
had to suffer such hardships in life; {%Kṛṣṇa%} attributes it to
the elevation of {%Arjuna's%} cheek-bones; {%Draupadī%} looked
angrily at {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who approved of her love. {%Bhīmasena%},
etc., became gratified with {%Arjuna's%} triumphs. A messenger
announced the arrival of {%Arjuna%}, and was presented with
large gifts. On the second day {%Arjuna%} entered the city
(description); people said that he had surpassed even {%Sagara%},
etc. {%Arjuna%} saluted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">υ</lang>). {%Babhruvāhana%}
[Page060-a+ 63]
came with his mother and entered the abode of {%Kuntī%}
(XIV, {@87@}); {%Citrāṅgadā%} [and {%Ulūpī%}] saluted {%Pṛthā%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>); {%Babhruvāhana%} saluted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">χ</lang>); {%Kṛṣṇa%}
gave him an excellent chariot and steeds, and the others
likewise gave him presents. On the third day {%Vyāsa%} told
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to commence the sacrifice, and to make the
{%dakṣiṇā%} threefold. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} underwent the {%dīkṣā%}. The
sacrifice was duly performed (description); 300 animals were
tied to the stakes in addition to the horse; this sacrifice was
honoured by the presence of D.-ṛ., G., Aps., Kp., and Ku.;
there were the disciples of {%Vyāsa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ψ</lang>) (XIV, {@88@});
having cooked the other animals, the priests sacrificed the
horse; after having cut it into pieces (B. cooking), they
caused {%Draupadī%} to sit near it; then the brahmans cooked its
marrow; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brothers smelled the sin-
destroying smoke of that marrow; the limbs (heart, tongue,
breast, etc., Nīl.) the sixteen {%ṛtvijs%} offered into the fire.
{%Vyāsa%} and his disciples eulogised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who gave
1,000 crores of golden {%niṣkas%} to the brahmans, and the
whole earth as {%dakṣiṇā%} to {%Vyāsa; Vyāsa%} returned it to him,
telling him to give the purchasing value instead; {%Yudhiṣ-%}
{%ṭhira%} said that the {%dakṣiṇā%} for the horse-sacrifice is the
earth, and that he would enter the woods and tell them to
divide it into four parts, one for each of the four principal
priests ({%? cāturhotrapramāṇataḥ%}; PCR. “according to what is
done in the {%cāturhotra%} sacrifice”); his brothers and {%Draupadī%}
approved of his words, as did also a voice in the sky;
{%Vyāsa%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} prevailed upon him to retain the earth
and give away millions of golden coins, trebling the {%dakṣiṇā%}
for the horse-sacrifice; no other king would be able to
accomplish what {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} thus did after the manner
of {%Marutta; Vyāsa%} gave the wealth (the price of the earth)
to the officiating priests, in four parts, and they distributed
it among the brahmans, who were also permitted to take the
ornaments of gold, etc.; the remaining wealth was allotted
to {%kṣattriyas, Vaiśyas, Śūdras%}, and {%Mlecchas. Vyāsa%} gave
away his own share to {%Kuntī%}, who devoted it to various
meritorious acts. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} performed the final sacrificial
bath, and dismissed the kings, etc. (<lang n="greek">ω</lang>), with proper honours
and gifts. There were oceans of wine of different kinds, etc.
(description); people of different realms speak of this sacrifice
to this day. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} entered his capital (XIV,
{@89@}).—§ 786: {%Janamejaya%} said: Tell me of any wonderful
incident that occurred in the sacrifice of my grandfather.
{%Vaiśampāyana%} related how a mongoose disparaged the
sacrifice: <is>Nakulākhyāna</is> ({%b%}); then the mongoose dis-
appeared, and the brahmans returned home. “Thou shouldst
not think highly of sacrifice; millions of Ṛ. have ascended to
Heaven with the sole aid of their penances; abstention from
injury, contentment, proper conduct, sincerity, penances, self-
restraint, truthfulness, and gifts are each equal in point of
merit to sacrifice” (XIV, {@90@}). Seeing that kings are given
to sacrifice, M.-ṛ. to penance, and learned brahmans to
tranquillity, etc., {%Janamejaya%} cannot but think that nothing
can be compared with the result of sacrifices, since {%Indra%}
obtained the sovereignty over the gods by his many sacrifices;
and when {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma%}, and {%Arjuna%} resembled {%Indra%},
“why did then that mongoose depreciate {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
horse-sacrifice?” {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Formerly, when
{%Indra%} was performing a sacrifice the Ṛ. felt compassion on
the animals, and said to {%Indra%} that the slaughter of animals
in sacrifices had not been ordained; according to the [true]
scriptural ordinances the sacrifice should be performed with
[Page060-b+ 63]
seeds of grain which had been kept for three years. As
{%Indra%} did not accept their words, a great dispute arose;
they referred to the {%Cedi%} king {%Vasu%}, who declared that
a sacrifice may be performed with whichever of the two
kinds of objects is ready; he therefore had to enter {%Rasātala%};
therefore no one should singly be relied upon, when a doubt
arises, except {%Brahmán%}; gifts made by a sinful person and
with wealth acquired by unrighteous means became lost;
while men possessing the wealth of penances acquired great
merit and proceeded to Heaven, by giving away, to the best
of their ability, grains of corn, or roots, etc., or water or
leaves. The same results are also won by compassion,
{%brahmacarya%}, truthfulness, kindness, fortitude, and forgiveness,
which are the eternal foundations of eternal righteousness;
having made gifts of articles lawfully acquired, {%Viśvāmitra%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), have attained to high success; those amongst
brahmans, {%kṣattriyas, vaiśyas%}, and {%Śūdras%}, who betake
themselves to penances, and who purify themselves by gifts
and other acts of righteousness, proceed to Heaven (XIV,
{@91@}). {%Janamejaya%} said: If Heaven is the result of wealth
acquired by lawful means, please tell me all about it; thou
hast told me the great result that accrued to the brahman
living by gleaning grains from his gift of powdered barley.
{%Vaiśampāyana%} cited the old narrative of what occurred in
former days at the great sacrifice of {%Agastya (e%}).—Asked by
{%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} explained that the mongoose
(v. Nakulākhyāna) with a golden head was {%Dharma%}, who
had been cursed by P., but freed from his curse by disparaging
himself in the form of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; “the mongoose dis-
appeared there in our very sight” (XIV, {@92@}).
