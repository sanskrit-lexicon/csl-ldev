[{@Śapathavidhi@}]¦ (“the taking of oaths”). § 751{%b%} (Anuśā-
sanik.) (†vv. 4549—4561). {%Bhīṣma%} said: Once B.-ṛ. and Ṛ.-ṛ.
proceeded to the western {%Prabhāsa%}, and resolved to visit
all the sacred waters on earth; there were {%Śukra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>),
and {%Indra%}; they reached {%Kauśikī%} on the day of full-moon in
the month of {%Māgha%}, and then {%Brahmasaras%}, where they
gathered and ate the stalks of the lotus; {%Agastya's%} stalks had
been taken away; he complained of the increasing unrighteous-
ness, and thought of going to heaven in order not to live to
see <is>yet worse things</is>; the Ṛ. took, each of them, the most
frightful oaths to their own innocence (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); but {%Indra%} uttered
“a benediction instead of a curse,” and confessed that he had
stolen the stalks, not from cupidity, but from desire of hearing
what Ṛ. would say. {%Agastya%} forgave him. Then they pro-
ceeded to other {%tīrthas%} *(XIII, {@94@}).
