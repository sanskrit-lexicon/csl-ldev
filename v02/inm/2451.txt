[{@Śapathavidhi@}]¦ (“the taking of oaths”). § 751{%b%} (Anuśā-
<div n="lb">sanik.) (†vv. 4549—4561). {%Bhīṣma%} said: Once B.-ṛ. and Ṛ.-ṛ.
<div n="lb">proceeded to the western {%Prabhāsa,%} and resolved to visit
<div n="lb">all the sacred waters on earth; there were {%Śukra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">and {%Indra;%} they reached {%Kauśikī%} on the day of full-moon in
<div n="lb">the month of {%Māgha,%} and then {%Brahmasaras,%} where they
<div n="lb">gathered and ate the stalks of the lotus; {%Agastya's%} stalks had
<div n="lb">been taken away; he complained of the increasing unrighteous-
<div n="lb">ness, and thought of going to heaven in order not to live to
<div n="lb">see yet worse things; the Ṛ. took, each of them, the most
<div n="lb">frightful oaths to their own innocence (<lang n="greek"></lang>); but {%Indra%} uttered
<div n="lb">“a benediction instead of a curse,” and confessed that he had
<div n="lb">stolen the stalks, not from cupidity, but from desire of hearing
<div n="lb">what Ṛ. would say. {%Agastya%} forgave him. Then they pro-
<div n="lb">ceeded to other {%tīrthas%} *(XIII, {@94@}).
