{@Rāmopākhyāna@}<sup>2</sup>¦ (“the episode relating to Rāma
Jāmadagnya”). § 638{%b%} (Rājadh.): {%Jahnu > Aja > Balākāśva%}
{%> Kuśika%}, who performed penances in order to get a son;
{%Indra%} became his son:
<C n="1"/>{%Gādhi%}. <C n="2"/>{%Bhṛgu%}.
<C n="1"/>(2) {%Viśvāmitra%}. <C n="2"/>(1) {%Satyavatī~Ṛcīka%}.
<C n="1"/>{%Jamadagni%}.
<C n="1"/>{%Paraśu-Rāma%}.
{%Ṛcīka%} destined a certain portion of the sacrificial food
(wherein had been placed the {%brahman%} energy) for {%Satyavatī%},
which would give her a son of great wisdom, the foremost
of {%brahmans%}; and another (wherein had been placed the sum
total of {%kṣatriya%} energy) for her mother, which would give
her for a son an invincible {%kṣatriya%}. Then {%Ṛcīka%} proceeded
to the woods to practise penances. King {%Gādhi%}, on a {%tīrtha-%}
{%yātrā%}, arrived at {%Ṛcīka's%} retreat with his queen. There the
mother of {%Satyavatī%}, from ignorance, exchanged the two
portions of the food. {%Ṛcīka%} predicted that the son of
{%Satyavatī%} would become a terrible {%kṣatriya%}, but asked by
{%Satyavatī%}, he granted that not her son ({%Jamadagni%}) but her
[Page592-b+ 63]
grandson ({%Paraśu-Rāma%}) would become such; her mother
would give birth to a brahman ({%Viśvāmitra%}). Besides the
other sciences, {%Rāma%} mastered the {%Dhanurveda%}; gratifying
{%Mahādeva%} on {%Gandhamādana%}, he asked him for weapons,
especially the axe, which made him unrivalled on earth.
Meanwhile the virtuous {%kṣatriya%}, the {%Haihaya%} king {%Arjuna%}
{%Kārtavīrya%}, who had got 1,000 arms through the grace of
{%Dattātreya%}, having subjugated the whole earth with its
mountains and seven islands, became a powerful emperor,
and gave away the earth to the {%brahmans%} at a horse-
sacrifice. Once, solicited by {%Agni%}, he gave alms to that
deity: springing from the points of his shafts, {%Agni%} burnt
villages, etc., and also the retreat of {%Āpava%} (i.e. {%Vasiṣṭha%},
Nīl.), who cursed {%Arjuna%}, saying that {%Rāma%} should lop off
his arms. {%Arjuna%}, always devoted to peace, always regardful
of {%brahmans%}, etc., did not think of that curse. His sons,
always haughty and cruel, seized and brought away the
calf of {%Jamadagni's homa-%}cow, without the knowledge of
{%Arjuna; Rāma%} lopped off the arms of {%Arjuna%} and brought
back the calf; the sons of {%Arjuna%} came and slew {%Jamadagni%},
in the absence of {%Rāma%}, who vowed to free the earth of
{%kṣatriyas%}, and slaughtered all the sons and grandsons of
{%Arjuna%}, and thousands of {%Haihayas%}, and annihilated all
{%kṣatriyas%}, and then, filled with compassion, retired into the
woods. After some thousands of years, the grandson of
{%Viśvāmitra%} and son of {%Raibhya, Parāvasu%} said to {%Rāma%} in
public: “were not {%Pratardana%}, etc., who were assembled
at a sacrifice at the time of {%Yayāti's%} fall, {%kṣatriyas%} by birth;
thou art not true of thy vow; through fear of {%kṣatriya%} heroes
thou hast betaken thyself to the mountains.” {%Rāma%} once
more slew {%kṣatriyas%} by hundreds. Those {%kṣatriyas%}, how-
ever, that he spared, counted by hundreds, multiplied and
became mighty monarchs on earth. {%Rāma%} once more
slaughtered them, not sparing the very children. Some
{%kṣatriya%} ladies, however, succeeded in protecting their
children. Having made the earth destitute of {%kṣatriyas%}
twenty-one times, {%Rāma%}, at the completion of a horse-
sacrifice, gave away the earth as a sacrificial present to
{%Kaśyapa%}. In order to preserve the remnant of the {%kṣatriyas%},
{%Kaśyapa%} told {%Rāma%} to repair to the shores of the southern
ocean and not to reside within his dominion. The ocean
suddenly created {%Śūrpāraka%} for {%Rāma. Kaśyapa%} gave the
earth to the {%brahmans%} and then entered the great forest.
Then {%śūdras%} and {%vaiśyas%} began to cohabit with the
wives of {%brahmans%}; unprotected duly by {%kṣatriyas%}, the
earth quickly sank, and was held by {%Kaśyapa%} on his lap
({%ūru%}), whence she was called {%Urvī%}. For protection's sake
she asked {%Kaśyapa%} for a king, saying that she had concealed
some {%Haihaya kṣatriyas%} among women; [further] {%Paurava%}
(son of {%Vidūratha%}), brought up among bears in the {%Ṛkṣavat%}
mountain; [further] a son of {%Saudāsa%}, protected through
compassion by {%Parāśara%}, and named {%Sarvakarman%} (etymology);
{%Śibi's%} son {%Gopati%}, brought up in the forest among kine;
{%Pratardana's%} son {%Vatsa%}, brought up among calves in a cow-
pen; {%Dadhivāhana's%} grandson and {%Diviratha's%} son, concealed
on the banks of {%Gaṅgā%} by {%Gautama; Bṛhadratha%}, protected by
apes ({%? golāṅgūlaiḥ%}, cf. BR.; PCR.: wolves) on {%Gṛdhrakūṭa%};
many {%kṣatriyas%} belonging to the race of {%Marutta%} have been
brought up by the ocean; they are living among artisans and
goldsmiths; “their fathers and grandfathers have been slain
for my sake by {%Rāma%}; it is my duty to see that their funeral
rites are duly performed.” {%Kaśyapa%}, seeking out those
{%kṣatriyas%}, installed them duly as kings in days of yore.
[Page593-a+ 63]
Those {%kṣatriya%} races that are now extant are the progeny
of those princes.
