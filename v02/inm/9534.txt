{@Sārasvata@},¦ a ṛṣi, son of Dadhīca and Sarasvatī. § 368
(Tīrthayātrāp.): III, {@83@}, 7058 ({%yatra%}—i.e. in Dadhīca's
tīrtha—{%S°o yātaḥ%} [read {%jātaḥ%} with PCR.] {%so 'ṅgirās tapaso%}
{%nidhiḥ%}, cf. § 615{%gg%}).—§ 371 (Tuṅgaka): III, {@85@}, 8189
({%Aṅgirasaḥ sutaḥ%}, when the Vedas had been lost, {%S%}. taught
them to the ascetics, cf. § 615{%gg%}).—§ 615 (Baladevatīrtha-
yātrā): IX, {@51@}, 2926 ({%°sya munes tīrthaṃ%}), 2927 ({%muniḥ%},
during a drought of twelve years he taught the Vedas to the
brahmans), 2928 ({%muniḥ%}).—§ 615{%gg%} (do.): In days of yore
the {%muni Dadhīca%}, living as a {%brahmacārin%}, had by his
[Page621-b+ 63]
austerities afficted {%Indra%} with fear. As he could not be
turned away even by diverse kinds of rewards, {%Indra%}
despatched to him the {%Apsaras Alambuṣā%} on the banks
of the {%Sarasvatī%}. At the sight of her his seed fell into
the {%Sarasvatī%}, the river held it in her womb and brought
forth a son whom she brought to the {%ṛṣis%}, who granted her
a boon, saying that the {%Viśvadevas%}, the {%ṛṣis%}, the {%Gandharvas%},
and the {%Apsarases%} would henceforth derive great happiness
when oblations of her water were presented to them, and
praised her as having sprung from the lake of {%Brahmán%}, etc.,
and said that the child should be named {%S.%}, and during
a drought of twelve years teach the {%Vedas%} to many brahmans,
and that she should become the foremost of all sacred rivers.
The river took the child with her. Meanwhile, on the
occasion of a war between the gods and the {%Dānavas, Indra%}
wandered through the three worlds in search of weapons,
but failed to find such weapons as were fit to slay the
enemies of the gods, until {%Dadhīca (hh%}), solicited by the
gods, gave up his life (and obtained many regions of in-
exhaustible merit) and Indra from his bones caused many
kinds of weapons (thunderbolts, discs, maces, clubs, and
bludgeons) to be made. With the thunderbolt born of {%Brāhma%}
energy and inspired with {%mantras, Indra%} made a loud noise
when he hurled it and slew ninety-nine heroes among the
{%Daityas%}. After a long time a twelve years' drought
occurred, and the ṛṣis fled away; only {%S%}. was retained by
the {%Sarasvatī%}, who supplied him with food, giving him large
fishes, and he offered oblations to the {%ṛṣis%} and the gods.
While wandering with famished stomachs, the ṛṣis had lost
the knowledge of the {%Vedas%} and solicited one another to
lecture on the {%Vedas%}. Then they learnt them from {%S.%},
becoming his disciples, 60,000 in number, though he was but
a boy: IX, {@51@}, 2945, 2946, 2947, 2962, 2967, 2968, 2970
({%muniśreṣṭhaṃ%}), 2976 ({%viprarṣeḥ%}).
