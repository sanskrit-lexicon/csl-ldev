<div n="lb">turned away even by diverse kinds of rewards, {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">despatched to him the {%Apsaras Alambuṣā%} on the banks
<div n="lb">of the {%Sarasvatī.%} At the sight of her his seed fell into
<div n="lb">the {%Sarasvatī,%} the river held it in her womb and brought
<div n="lb">forth a son whom she brought to the {%ṛṣis,%} who granted her
<div n="lb">a boon, saying that the {%Viśvadevas,%} the {%ṛṣis,%} the {%Gandharvas,%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Apsarases%} would henceforth derive great happiness
<div n="lb">when oblations of her water were presented to them, and

<div n="lb">and that she should become the foremost of all sacred rivers.
<div n="lb">The river took the child with her. Meanwhile, on the
<div n="lb">occasion of a war between the gods and the {%Dānavas, Indra%}
<div n="lb">wandered through the three worlds in search of weapons,
<div n="lb">but failed to find such weapons as were fit to slay the
<div n="lb">enemies of the gods, until {%Dadhīca (hh),%} solicited by the
<div n="lb">gods, gave up his life (and obtained many regions of in-
<div n="lb">exhaustible merit) and Indra from his bones caused many
<div n="lb">kinds of weapons (thunderbolts, discs, maces, clubs, and
<div n="lb">bludgeons) to be made. With the thunderbolt born of {%Brāhma%}
<div n="lb">energy and inspired with {%mantras, Indra%} made a loud noise
<div n="lb">when he hurled it and slew ninety-nine heroes among the

<div n="lb">While wandering with famished stomachs, the ṛṣis had lost
<div n="lb">the knowledge of the {%Vedas%} and solicited one another to
