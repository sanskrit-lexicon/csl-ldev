{@[Rājyalābhaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“on the Pāṇḍavas' getting
<div n="lb">half of the kingdom,” the 15th of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.). (Cf. Rājyalābha, Rājyalambha.) § 244: The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} with {%Kuntī%} and {%Kṛṣṇā%} journeyed towards {%Hāstina-%}
<div n="lb">{%pura. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} despatched {%Vikarṇa, Citrasena, Droṇa,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kṛpa%} to receive them. The inhabitants were filled
<div n="lb">with joy. In order to prevent any difference between them
<div n="lb">and their cousins, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} caused them, with {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">in the van, to repair to {%Khāṇḍavaprastha,%} taking half the
<div n="lb">kingdom. With {%Dvaipāyana's%} assistance they measured out
<div n="lb">a piece of land for their city, which was very beautiful, and
<div n="lb">came to be called {%Indraprastha.%} Having settled the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">there, {%Kṛṣṇa%} came back with {%Rāma%} to {%Dvāravatī%} (I, {@207@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 245: When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were dwelling in happiness
<div n="lb">at {%Khāṇḍavaprastha,%} one day the {%Devarṣi Nārada%} came to
<div n="lb">them, and recommended them to make an arrangement so
<div n="lb">that disunion might not arise among them for the sake of their
<div n="lb">common wife, mentioning how {%Sunda%} and {%Upasunda%} had killed
<div n="lb">each other for the sake of {%Tilottamā. Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
<div n="lb">who those {%Asuras%} were, and who this {%Tilottamā%} was (I, {@208@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 246: {%Sundopasundopākhyāna%} (q.v.). The arrangement
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} made was, that if one of them should be sitting
<div n="lb">with {%Draupadī,%} and one of the other ones should happen to
<div n="lb">see it, he would have to retire into the forest for twelve
<div n="lb">years and live as a {%brahmacārin.%} Then {%Nārada%} went away
<div n="lb">(I, {@212@}).
