{@[Pañcaśikha-vākya(ṃ)]@}¦ (“the discourse of Pañca-
śikha”). § 668{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: The {%Mithilā%}
king Janaka was always engaged in reflecting upon the courses
of conduct that might lead to the attainment of {%Bráhman%}.
One hundred preceptors always used to live in his palace.
Given to the study of the {%Vedas%}, he was not very well
satisfied with the speculations of his instructors on the
character of the soul and their doctrines of extinction upon
the dissolution of the body or of rebirth after death.
Once the great ascetic {%Pañcaśikha Kāpileya%} came to {%Mithilā%},
having roamed over the earth. He seemed to have
assumed the form of that great {%Ṛ%}. [and] {%Prajāpati%}, whom
the {%Sāṅkhyas%} call {%Kapila%}; they say he was the first disciple
of {%Āsuri%} [and] long-living. He was performing a mental
sacrifice for 1,000 years (cf. Pañcasrotas). He was fully con-
versant with the {%Pañcarātra%} (i.e. “the sacrifice that leads to
the state of {%Viṣṇu”%}, Nīl.) and the five sheaths that cover the
soul, etc. He had approached one day a large concourse [of {%Ṛ%}.]
following the {%Sāṅkhya%} doctrine ({%Kāpilaṃ%}), and instructed them
about the Unmanifest; {%Āsuri%} had inquired of his preceptor
(? so Nīl. and PCR.) and understood the distinction between the
body and the soul, and had acquired celestial vision. For
that assembly of {%Ṛ., Āsuri%} made his exposition of {%Bráhman%}.
{%Pañcaśikha%} became a disciple of {%Āsuri%}; he lived on human
milk; he was accepted as a son by the {%brāhmaṇī Kapilā%}, the
wife of {%Āsuri%}, and used to suck her breasts. This was said
to me by the holy one [i.e. Mārkaṇḍeya or Sanatkumāra,
Nīl.]. {%Janaka%}, abandoning his 100 preceptors, began to
follow {%Kāpileya%} (i.e. {%Pañcaśikha%}) upon the religion of emanci-
pation which is explained in {%Sāṅkhya%} treatises. “Some say
that, when ignorance is destroyed by knowledge, the destruction
[Page525-a+ 63]
of existence itself follows [this opinion also is erroneous].”
The king became filled with wonder (XII, {@218@}). Continuation
of the discourse between {%Pañcaśikha%} and the king on the topic
of existence and non-existence after death. The {%Mithilā%} king
({%Maithilena%}), beholding his city burning in a conflagration,
himself proclaimed ({%gītaṃ%}), “in this conflagration nothing of
mine is burning.” The king gave up his sorrows, etc. He
who reads this discourse attains to emancipation (XII, {@219@}).
