{@[Pañcaśikha-vākya(ṃ)]@}¦ (“the discourse of Pañca-
<div n="lb">śikha”). § 668{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: The {%Mithilā%}
<div n="lb">king Janaka was always engaged in reflecting upon the courses
<div n="lb">of conduct that might lead to the attainment of {%Bráhman.%}
<div n="lb">One hundred preceptors always used to live in his palace.
<div n="lb">Given to the study of the {%Vedas,%} he was not very well
<div n="lb">satisfied with the speculations of his instructors on the
<div n="lb">character of the soul and their doctrines of extinction upon
<div n="lb">the dissolution of the body or of rebirth after death.
<div n="lb">Once the great ascetic {%Pañcaśikha Kāpileya%} came to {%Mithilā,%}
<div n="lb">having roamed over the earth. He seemed to have
<div n="lb">assumed the form of that great {%Ṛ.%} [and] {%Prajāpati,%} whom
<div n="lb">the {%Sāṅkhyas%} call {%Kapila;%} they say he was the first disciple
<div n="lb">of {%Āsuri%} [and] long-living. He was performing a mental
<div n="lb">sacrifice for 1,000 years (cf. Pañcasrotas). He was fully con-
<div n="lb">versant with the {%Pañcarātra%} (i.e. “the sacrifice that leads to
<div n="lb">the state of {%Viṣṇu”,%} Nīl.) and the five sheaths that cover the
<div n="lb">soul, etc. He had approached one day a large concourse [of {%Ṛ.%}]
<div n="lb">following the {%Sāṅkhya%} doctrine {%(Kāpilaṃ),%} and instructed them
<div n="lb">about the Unmanifest; {%Āsuri%} had inquired of his preceptor
<div n="lb">(? so Nīl. and PCR.) and understood the distinction between the
<div n="lb">body and the soul, and had acquired celestial vision. For
<div n="lb">that assembly of {%Ṛ., Āsuri%} made his exposition of {%Bráhman.%}
<div n="lb">{%Pañcaśikha%} became a disciple of {%Āsuri;%} he lived on human
<div n="lb">milk; he was accepted as a son by the {%brāhmaṇī Kapilā,%} the
<div n="lb">wife of {%Āsuri,%} and used to suck her breasts. This was said
<div n="lb">to me by the holy one [i.e. Mārkaṇḍeya or Sanatkumāra,
<div n="lb">Nīl.]. {%Janaka,%} abandoning his 100 preceptors, began to
<div n="lb">follow {%Kāpileya%} (i.e. {%Pañcaśikha%}) upon the religion of emanci-
<div n="lb">pation which is explained in {%Sāṅkhya%} treatises. “Some say
<div n="lb">that, when ignorance is destroyed by knowledge, the destruction
[Page525-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">of existence itself follows [this opinion also is erroneous].”
<div n="lb">The king became filled with wonder (XII, {@218@}). Continuation
<div n="lb">of the discourse between {%Pañcaśikha%} and the king on the topic
<div n="lb">of existence and non-existence after death. The {%Mithilā%} king
<div n="lb">{%(Maithilena),%} beholding his city burning in a conflagration,
<div n="lb">himself proclaimed {%(gītaṃ),%} “in this conflagration nothing of
<div n="lb">mine is burning.” The king gave up his sorrows, etc. He
<div n="lb">who reads this discourse attains to emancipation (XII, {@219@}).
