{@Agastya@}<sup>2</sup>:¦ XIII, 3400 ({%A°ṃ gotrataś cāpi nāmataś cāpi%}
{%śarmiṇaṃ%}), might allude to a brahman of Agastya's race,
named Śarmin (called before Yama to receive instructions
and then dismissed); yet III, 8521, the epithet “bhagavān”
naturally leads the thought upon Agastya himself; BR. takes
{%śarmiṇaṃ%} to be an adjective—“happy.”
