{@[Pavana-śālmali-saṃvāda(ḥ)]@}¦ (“the discourse between
<div n="lb">the Wind-god and the {%śālmali-%}tree”). § 654{%b%} (Āpaddh.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: There was a lordly {%śālmali-%}tree on the
<div n="lb">{%Himavat.%} One day {%Nārada%} praised it, saying that {%Pavana%}
<div n="lb">must be its friend and protector, since he spared it, though
<div n="lb">he eradicates the tallest and strongest trees (XII, {@154@}). The
<div n="lb">{%śālmali%} said that the Wind was not its friend, but that it
<div n="lb">was stronger itself than the Wind. {%Nārada%} warned him,
<div n="lb">saying that the Wind was stronger than even {%Indra,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@155@}). Informed by {%Nārada,%} the Wind came and
<div n="lb">rebuked the {%śālmali-%}tree, saying that he had spared it because
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} while creating the world, had for a time rested
<div n="lb">under it. The {%śālmali%} laughed and challenged the Wind
<div n="lb">to show his power, which the Wind threatened to do next
<div n="lb">day. When night came the {%śālmali%} reflected that all that
<div n="lb">it had said to {%Nārada%} was false, that it was in reality weaker
<div n="lb">than other trees, and inferior in might to the Wind; “but
<div n="lb">in intelligence no tree is my equal” (XII, {@156@}). The
<div n="lb">{%śālmali%} then caused all its branches to be cut off. The Wind
<div n="lb">smiled; the {%śālmali%} felt great shame, and, remembering the
<div n="lb">words of {%Nārada,%} repented greatly of his folly.
