[{@Gandhamādana-praveśa(ḥ)@}]¦ (“proceeding to the
Gandhamādana”). § 419 (cf. Tīrthayātrāp.): {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
in vain proposed that {%Bhīma%} should return with {%Kṛṣṇā%},
{%Sahadeva, Dhaumya%}, the charioteers, cooks, etc., to {%Gaṅgā-%}
{%dvāra%}, while {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should proceed with {%Nakula%} and
{%Lomaśa. Bhīma%} promised to carry {%Kṛṣṇā%} and the twins.
{%Kṛṣṇā%} said that she would be able to go. They entrusted
to the {%Pulinda%} king (v. 10866, {%Kulindānāṃ%}) {%Subāhu%} on the
{%Himavat%} (inhabited by {%Kirātas, Taṅgaṇas%}, and {%Pulindas%}),
the servants {%Indrasena%}, etc., the cooks and stewards, and
{%Draupadī's%} accoutrements, and began to proceed (III, {@140@}).—
§ 420: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} complained to {%Bhīma%} that he had not
seen {%Arjuna%} for five years. They now should, in company with
brahmans of strict vows, enter {%Gandhamādana (b%}), etc. (III,
{@141@}).—§ 421: Exhorted by {%Lomaśa%}, when they were about
to go to the mountain {%Mandara (b%}), they adored {%Ākāśagaṅgā%}
(v. 10902, read with B. {%puṇyā%} for {%puśyā%}) ({%c%}), and then
proceeded with the {%ṛṣis%}.—§ 422: Then they saw the bones
of the {%Daitya Naraka (b%}) like to a white mountain.—§ 422 {%bis%}:
Varāhāvatāra (q.v.), III, {@142@}.—§ 423: As they, with the
brahmans, entered {%Gandhamādana (b%}) a terrible wind arose,
followed by showers of rain, lightning, and torrents, during
which they took shelter under trees, etc., {%Sahadeva%} carrying
the sacred fire ({%agnihotrāṇi%}). When the tempest was over
and the sun reappeared, they continued their journey (III,
{@143@}). When they had proceeded only a {%krośa, Draupadī%}
sank down. {%Nakula%} ran forward and supported her, and the
others hastily came, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} took her on his lap and
lamented. {%Dhaumya%} and the other brahmans comforted and
blessed him, and by reciting {%mantras%} capable of dispelling
{%Rākṣasas%}, and by performing ceremonies, while she was
touched and fanned by the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, they made her regain
her senses. The twins pressed her feet with their hands.
{%Bhīma%} promised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to carry them all over the
snowy mountains, “or {%Ghaṭotkaca%} will carry us all.” With
{%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} permission {%Bhīma%} thought of {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, who
immediately came and was embraced by {%Bhīma%} (III, {@144@}).
{%Ghaṭotkaca%} carried {%Kṛṣṇā%} through the air, and hundreds of
other {%Rākṣasas%} carried the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the brahmans,
while {%Lomaśa%} moved along the path of the {%Siddhas%}. So they
proceeded through regions inhabited by {%Mlecchas, Vidyā-%}
{%dharas%}, monkeys, {%Kinnaras, Kimpuruṣas, Gandharvas%}, etc.,
and the northern {%Kurus%}, towards {%Kailāsa%} and {%Badarī (c%}), where
they were received by the numerous {%ṛṣis%}, and where they
dwelt, beholding {%Maināka, Hiraṇyaśikkara, Bindusaras%}, and
{%Bhāgīrathī%}, and offering oblations, etc. (III, {@145@})
