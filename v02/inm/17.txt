<div n="lb">the force protected by {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa,%} save {%Mahādeva;%}

<div n="lb">the ancient story of what {%Nārada%} had said in days of old to

<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} the story of {%Sṛñjaya%} (q.v.), to whom {%Nārada%} told
<div n="lb">{%Ṣoḍaśarājika%} (VII, {@55—70@}). {%Vyāsa%} says that {%Abhimanyu%} has
<div n="lb">attained to that eternal goal which is attained by {%Yogins,%} and
<div n="lb">those that are living in heaven never prefer this world to
<div n="lb">heaven; “it is the living that stand in need of our grief, and
<div n="lb">not those who have attained to heaven; his sins increase for
<div n="lb">whom the living grieve.” Then {%Vyāsa%} disappeared, and
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} became free from grief; but—“what shall we
<div n="lb">say to {%Arjuna?%}” (VII, {@71@}).
