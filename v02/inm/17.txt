[{@Abhimanyuvadhaparvan(va)@}]¦ (“the section including
the slaughter of Abhimanyu,” the 73rd of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.; cf. Abhimanyuvadha). § 593: {@The 13th@}
{@day@}: Broken by {%Arjuna%}, and {%Droṇa%} having failed to seize
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, the {%Kurus%} were regarded as defeated; they
heard all praising {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}. Next morning
{%Duryodhana%} blamed {%Droṇa%} for not having seized {%Yudhiṣṭhira%};
{%Droṇa%} said that even D., As., G., Y., N., and Rā. cannot defeat
the force protected by {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, save {%Mahādeva%};
but to-day he would slay a mighty car-warrior. The
{%Saṃśaptakas%} challenged {%Arjuna%} and took him away to the
southern side of the field. {%Abhimanyu's%} slaughter by
{%Duḥśāsana's%} son is alluded to by {%Sañjaya. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
grieves. {%Sañjaya%} relates (VII, {@33@}). {%Sañjaya%} praises {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Droṇa%} had formed the great circular array
({%cakravyūha): Lakṣmaṇa%} (the grandson of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}) at
their head; {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) in the middle; at the head the
commander {%Droṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>) (VII, {@34@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} were
headed by {%Bhīmasena: Sātyaki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) & {%Droṇa%}, whom
the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Sṛñjayas%} could not approach. {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} says that only {%Abhimanyu%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), can break the
array of {%Droṇa%}, and orders {%Abhimanyu%} to do it; {%Bhīma%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>) followed him; praised by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who says that the
protectors of {%Droṇa's%} host resemble S., R., M., V., or {%Agni%}, or
{%Āditya, Abhimanyu%} orders his charioteer {%Sumitra%} to urge
the steeds towards {%Droṇa's%} army (VII, {@35@}). {%Abhimanyu%}
(with {%Sumitra%}), etc., & {%Droṇa%}, etc.; {%Abhimanyu%} breaks
that part of the {%Kuru%} army; many steeds of the {%Vanāyu%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>), breeds were deprived of their ornaments, and caused
delight to Rā., etc. (VII, {@36@}). {%Duryodhana & Abhimanyu%};
{%Droṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>) & {%Abhimanyu%} rescuing {%Duryodhana; Duḥsaha%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), & {%Abhimanyu%}, who slew the heir of {%Aśmaka%};
{%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), & {%Abhimanyu%}, who slew {%Suṣeṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>), and
defeated {%Śalya; Droṇa's%} troops fled; P., D., Cā., Si., etc.,
glorify {%Abhimanyu%} (VII, {@37@}). {%Abhimanyu%} slays {%Śalya's%}
younger brother, whose followers fled. {%Abhimanyu%}, with
the weapons he has received from {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%},
defeats all the warriors that encounter him. {%Droṇa's%} army
fled (VII, {@38@}). {%Abhimanyu & Droṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>). {%Droṇa%} says
that {%Abhimanyu%} delights {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>). {%Duryodhana%}
told {%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), to crush {%Abhimanyu%}, whom they attacked;
{%Duḥśāsana & Abhimanyu%} (VII, {@39@}); {%Abhimanyu%} addresses
{%Duḥśāsana%} (mentioning the dice, etc.); {%Duḥśāsana%} is borne
away by his charioteer; the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>), uttered
leonine shouts, and attacked {%Droṇa's%} array. {%Karṇa%} (urged
by {%Duryodhana%}). & {%Abhimanyu%} (desirous of proceeding
towards {%Droṇa%}); when {%Karṇa%} is in great distress his younger
brother encounters {%Abhimanyu%} (VII, {@40@}). {%Abhimanyu%} slays
{%Karṇa's%} younger brother; {%Karṇa%} flies; the {%Kaurava%} array
breaks, except the {%Sindhu%}-king (VII, {@41@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>), endeavour to follow {%Abhimanyu. Jayadratha%} checks
them with celestial weapons. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} enquires of
{%Sañjaya%} about the source of {%Jayadratha's%} energy; {%Sañjaya%}
narrates the boon obtained by {%Jayadratha%} from {%Śiva%} (VII, {@42@}).
{%Jayadratha%} vanquishes all the {%Pāṇḍava%} leaders with his steeds
of the {%Sindhu%}-breed: {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>); {%Bhīma%} mounts the
car of {%Sātyaki%}; the path made by {%Abhimanyu%} is closed up;
[Page003-a+ 63]
notwithstanding the {%Matsyas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>); they are all checked
by {%Jayadratha%} (VII, {@43@}). {%Abhimanyu%} vanquished {%Vṛṣasena%},
who was borne away from the battle, and slew {%Vasāliya%} and
many others (VII, {@44@}). {%Abhimanyu%} seized {%Satyaśravas%} and
routed the {%Kurus; Rukmaratha%} (the son of {%Śalya%}) & {%Abhi-%}
{%manyu%}, who slew him and his friends (100 princes) with the
{%Gāndharva%}-weapon ({%b%}), though they were assisted by {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}, who was filled with fear and fled (VII, {@45@}). {%Droṇa%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>), & {%Abhimanyu%}, who beats them back-except
{%Lakṣmaṇa%} (who is followed by {%Duryodhana%}), who is slain.
{%Duryodhana%} urged the troops to slay {%Abhimanyu; Droṇa%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">υ</lang>), encompassed {%Abhimanyu%}, who seeks {%Jayadratha; Krātha's%}
son was slain, the others fled (VII, {@46@}). {%Droṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>), &
{%Abhimanyu + Yudhiṣṭhira%} supporting {%Jayadratha; Karṇa%}
has one ear cut off; {%Abhimanyu%} slew {%Vṛndāraka%} and {%Bṛhadbala%}
(VII, {@47@}); {%Abhimanyu%} once more pierced {%Karṇa%} in the ear,
and slew the son of the {%Magadha%}-king, and {%Aśvaketu%}, and
the {%Bhoja%} prince of {%Mārttikāvata%} (bearing the device of an
elephant); the son of {%Duḥśāsana & Abhimanyu; Aśvatthāman%}
& do.; {%Abhimanyu & Śalya%}, who mounts another car;
{%Abhimanyu%} slew {%Śatruñjaya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">χ</lang>); {%Abhimanyu & Śakuni%},
who tells {%Duryodhana%} to take counsel with {%Droṇa%} and {%Kṛpa%},
etc., about the means of slaying {%Abhimanyu; Karṇa%} asks
{%Droṇa%} about the means of slaying {%Abhimanyu; Droṇa%}, saying
that he is gratified by {%Abhimanyu's%} prowess, tells {%Karṇa%}, who
is very afflicted with arrows, to cut off his bow, etc. {%Karṇa%}
then cut off {%Abhimanyu's%} bow, {%Kṛtavarman%} slew his steeds,
and {%Kṛpa%} slew his two {%Pārṣṇi%} charioteers; {%Abhimanyu%}, then
attacked by six car-warriors, fights with the sword, which is
cut off by {%Droṇa%}, while {%Karṇa%} cut off his shield (VII, {@48@});
then {%Abhimanyu%} fought with a wheel; then with a mace;
{%Abhimanyu & Aśvatthāman; Abhimanyu%} slew ({%? apothayat%})
{%Subala's%} son {%Kālikeya%}, and slew 77 {%Gāndhāra%} followers of his,
and 10 {%Brahma-Vasātīyas%} ({%punar Brahma-Vasātīyān%}, C.; B.
has {%punaś caiva Vasātīyān%}), 7 {%Kaikayas%} ({%Kaikayānāṃ%}, C.;
B. has {%Kekayānām%}), and 10 elephants; {%Abhimanyu &%}
{%Duḥśāsana's%} son, who slays {%Abhimanyu%}. Invisible creatures
censure the cowardly act of the {%Kurus%}, headed by {%Droṇa%} and
{%Karṇa%}. The {%Pāṇḍava%} divisions fly, but are rallied by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (VII, {@49@}). In the evening the {%Kurus%} withdrew
to their encampment. Rā. and Pś., etc., on the field of battle
(VII, {@50@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} laments on the fall of {%Abhimanyu%}
(VII, {@51@}).—§ 594: {%Vyāsa%} comes and consoles him (“death
takes all: D., Dā., G., without exception”), relating to him
the ancient story of what {%Nārada%} had said in days of old to
{%Akampana%} (q.v.). “This story is purifying, etc.; cast off thy
grief; {%Abhimanyu%} has attained to heaven; sprung from {%Soma%},
he has disappeared in the lunar essence, cleansed from all his
impurities” (VII, {@54@}).—§ 595: {%Vyāsa%} recites to {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} the story of {%Sṛñjaya%} (q.v.), to whom {%Nārada%} told
{%Ṣoḍaśarājika%} (VII, {@55—70@}). {%Vyāsa%} says that {%Abhimanyu%} has
attained to that eternal goal which is attained by {%Yogins%}, and
those that are living in heaven never prefer this world to
heaven; “it is the living that stand in need of our grief, and
not those who have attained to heaven; his sins increase for
whom the living grieve.” Then {%Vyāsa%} disappeared, and
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} became free from grief; but—“what shall we
say to {%Arjuna?%}” (VII, {@71@}).
