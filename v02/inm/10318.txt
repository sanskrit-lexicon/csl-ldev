[{@Sundopasundapākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
<div n="lb">to Sunda and Upasunda”). § 246 (Rājyalābhap.). {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">related: In days of yore the {%Daitya Nikumbha%} of the race of
<div n="lb">{%Hiraṇyakaśipu%} had two sons, {%Sunda%} and {%Upasunda,%} who always
<div n="lb">shared with each other happiness as well as woe, and never
<div n="lb">went anywhere unless together. Desirous of subjugating
<div n="lb">the three worlds, they practised terrible penances on the
<div n="lb">mountain {%Vindhya,%} which, by the power of their austerities at
<div n="lb">last began to emit vapour. In vain the gods repeatedly
<div n="lb">tempted them by means of every precious possession and
<div n="lb">beautiful girls, and by illusion, causing their sisters, mothers,
<div n="lb">wives, etc., to appear pursued by a {%rākṣasa%} and imploring their
<div n="lb">help. When {%Brahmán%} granted them a boon, they asked to
<div n="lb">become immortal, which he refused, granting them instead
<div n="lb">that they should not need to be afraid of anything except
<div n="lb">each other, etc. They now desisted from their asceticism
<div n="lb">and returned to their abode, where they lived happy, causing
<div n="lb">even the moon to rise over their city every night, even out of
<div n="lb">season (I, {@209@}). They set out to conquer the three worlds
<div n="lb">in the night under the constellation of {%Maghāḥ,%} with a large
<div n="lb">{%Daitya%} force cased in mail, etc. The gods sought refuge in
<div n="lb">{%Brahmaloka,%} and the {%Daityas%} subjugated {%Indraloka,%} and van-
<div n="lb">quished the tribes of the {%Yakṣas%} and {%Rakṣases,%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Khecaras,%} and the {%Nāgas%} in the earth, and the tribes of the
<div n="lb">{%Mlecchas%} dwelling in the ocean. In order to extinguish the
<div n="lb">sacrifices that strengthened the gods, they slew those that
<div n="lb">were performing sacrifices and the assistant {%brahmans,%} etc.
<div n="lb">Then they took up their abode in {%Kurukṣetra%} (I, {@210@}).
<div n="lb">The {%Devarṣis%} and {%Siddhas%} and {%ṛṣis%} were affected with great
<div n="lb">grief, and went to the abode of {%Pitāmaha,%} seated with the
<div n="lb">gods, the {%Siddhas,%} and the {%Brahmarṣis, Mahādeva, Agni,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vāyu,%} the sun and moon, {%Śakra,%} the {%Pārameṣṭhya ṛṣis,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Vaikhānasas,%} the {%Vālakhilyas,%} the {%Vānaprasthas,%} the {%Marīcipas,%}
<div n="lb">the {%Ajas,%} the {%Avimūḍhas,%} etc. {%Brahmán%} sent {%Tilottamā (b)%}
<div n="lb">to them (I, {@211@}). She came to {%Sunda%} and {%Upasunda%} as they
<div n="lb">were sporting in the {%Vindhya%} mountains, and from jealousy
<div n="lb">they struck each other to death with their maces. And
<div n="lb">{%Pitāmaha%} then came there with the gods and the great {%ṛṣis,%}
<div n="lb">and granted to {%Tilottamā%} that she should roam in the region
<div n="lb">of the {%Ādityas.%} Then, bestowing the three worlds on {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">as before, he returned to his own region.
