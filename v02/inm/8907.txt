{@[Rājasūyārambhaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the beginning of
the rājasūya sacrifice,” the 22nd of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Rājasūyasya ārambhaḥ.)—§ 272: {%Yudhiṣ-%}
{%ṭhira%} consulted his counsellors, brothers, {%ṛtvijes%}, ministers,
[Page582-a+ 63]
{%Dhaumya, Dvaipāyana%}, etc., as to the {%rājasūya%} (“in which
{%ṛṣis%} of austere vows establish six fires singing {%mantras%} of
the {%Sāmaveda%}; at the conclusion thereof the performer,
when installed in the sovereignty, is rewarded with the
fruit of all sacrifices, including the {%darvīhomas%}”). They all
encouraged him to perform it. All people lived happily
under his sway and loved him (therefore he was called
{%Ajātaśatru%}); {%Bhīma%} ruled over all men justly, {%Arjuna%}
protected the people from enemies, {%Sahadeva%} administered
justice impartially, {%Nakula%} behaved towards everybody with
humility. There was no extortion, disease, etc. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
sent a messenger to {%Kṛṣṇa%} in {%Dvāravatī%}, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} came to
{%Indraprastha%} accompanied by {%Indrasena%}, and was consulted
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (II, {@13@}).—§ 273: {%Kṛṣṇa%} said that
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, in order to become {%samrāj%}, ought to slay the
{%Magadha%} king {%Jarāsandha%}, and deliver the princes whom
{%Jarāsandha%} held shut up in a mountain hole in order to
sacrifice them to {%Mahādeva%} (i.e. Śiva). “The now existing
{%kṣatriyas%} are descended from the remnants of those who
were exterminated by {%Rāma%}. They represent themselves to
be the descendants of {%Aila%} and {%Ikṣvāku%}; of those there are
100 families. The {%Bhojas%}, descendants of {%Yayāti%}, are great
and scattered all over the earth; but now {%Jarāsandha%}, ruling
the middle land (i.e. Mathurā, Nīl.), has overpowered them.
His allies are (1) {%Śiśupāla%}, who has become his {%senāpati%};
(2) the {%Karūṣa%} king {%Vakra%}, who fights by illusion
({%māyāyodhin%}); (3—4) {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka%} (see below);
(5—8) {%Dantavakra, Karūṣa, Karabha, Meghavāhana%}; (9)
{%Bhagadatta%}, the {%Yavana%} king, the ruler of the west, who
bears on his head the most wonderful gem on earth, the
old friend of thy father, and who chastises {%Muru%} and
{%Naraka%}; he obeys {%Jarāsandha%}, but in his heart he is tied by
affection to thee; (10) the king of {%Aṅga, Vaṅga, Puṇḍra%},
and of the {%Kirātas, Pauṇḍraka Vāsudeva%}, who among the
{%Cedis%} is called {%Puruṣottama%}, and always bears, from
foolishness, the distinctive signs of {%Kṛṣṇa%}; (11) {%Bhīṣmaka%},
king of the {%Bhojas%}, the friend of {%Indra%}, who governs
a fourth part of the world, who by his learning has
conquered the {%Pāṇḍyas, Krathas%}, and {%Kaiśikas%}, and whose
brother {%Ākṛti%} is like to {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}, has placed
himself under {%Jarāsandha%}, though {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc., his relatives,
are engaged every day in doing what is agreeable to him.
Only {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} maternal uncle, the {%Kunti%} king {%Purujit%},
who has his dominions in the west and the south, regards
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with affection. The following peoples have fled
for fear of {%Jarāsandha%}: (1) the eighteen tribes of the northern
{%Bhojas%} have fled towards the west; (2—10) the {%Śūrasenas%},
{%Bhadrakāras, Bodhas, Śālvas, Paṭaccaras, Susthalas, Mukuṭṭas%}
(B. Su°), {%Kulindas%}, and {%Kuntis%}; (11—13) the {%Śālvāyana%}
kings with their brethren and followers, the southern
{%Pāñcālas%}, and the eastern {%Kośalas%}, have all fled to the
{%Kuntis(?%}); (14—15) the {%Matsyas%} and the {%Sannyastapādas%}
(? so B.; C. Sanya°) have left their dominions in the north
and fled into the southern country; (16) all the {%Pāñcālas%}
have fled in all directions.” {%Jarāsandha's%} relations to the
{%Yādavas%} were the following: {%Kaṃsa%}, having persecuted the
{%Yādavas%}, married {%Asti%} and {%Prāpti%}, daughters of {%Jarāsandha%}
and sisters of {%Sahadeva%}, and began also to oppress the old
chiefs of the {%Bhojas%}, who sought the help of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc.;
{%Kṛṣṇa%} bestowed upon {%Akrūra%} the daughter of {%Āhuka%},
and with {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%} (i.e. Balarāma) he slew {%Kaṃsa%} and
{%Sunāman%}. Then {%Jarāsandha%} took up arms, and the eighteen
tribes ({%kulair aṣṭādaśāvaraiḥ%} (?), differently Nīl.) thought
[Page582-b+ 63]
they would be unable to check him even in 300 years.
His friends {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka%} were incapable of being
slain by weapons. Some other king, named {%Haṃsa%} (differently
Nīl.), was slain by {%Rāma%} in the battle of the eighteen tribes
({%aṣṭādaśāvare?%}); then {%Ḍimbhaka%}, thinking that he could not
live without {%Haṃsa%}, killed himself in the {%Yamunā%}, and
{%Haṃsa%}, hearing that, also jumped into the {%Yamunā%}; then
{%Jarāsandha%} returned to his kingdom, and the {%Yādavas%}
continued to live at {%Mathurā%}. But the widow of {%Kaṃsa%}
(PCR. {%Haṃsa%}), the daughter of {%Jarāsandha%}, urging him
to revenge the death of her husband, the {%Yādavas%} fled
from {%Mathurā%}, and took up their abode in {%Kuśasthalī%}
(i.e. {%Dvāravatī%}), adorned by {%Raivata%}, and strongly fortified
the {%Gomanta%} mountains, three {%yojanas%} in length. “In the
race of {%Kṛṣṇa%} there are 8,000 brothers [and cousins, PCR.].
{%Āhuka%} has 100 sons. {%Cārudeṣṇa%} with his brother, {%Cakradeva%},
{%Sātyaki, Kṛṣṇa, Rauhiṇeya%} (i.e. {%Balarāma%}), and {%Śāmba%} (like
{%Śauri%} in battle) are seven heroes ({%rathāḥ); Kṛtavarman%},
{%Anādhṛṣṭi, Śamīka, Samitiñjaya, Kaṅka, Śaṅku%}, and {%Kunti%}
are seven {%mahārathas%}; then there are also two sons of
{%Andhakabhoja%} and himself; all these heroes, remembering
the middle country, are now living among the {%Vṛṣṇis%}”
(II, {@14@}).—§ 274: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had some scruples, which
were opposed by {%Bhīma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who cited from the
{%Kṛta%} age five kings, who had become emperors ({%samrāj%}):
{%Yauvanāśvi%} (i.e. {%Māndhātṛ%}) by the remission of taxes
(B. {%jitvā jayyān%}, “by victories”), {%Bhagīratha%} by protection,
[Arjuna-] {%Kārtavīrya%} by asceticism, {%Bharata%} by strength,
and {%Marutta%} by prosperity; 100 families of kings have been
unable to oppose {%Jarāsandha%}; he has already brought
eighty-six kings to the house of {%Paśupati%} (i.e. Śiva); when
he has fourteen more he will offer them as sacrifices (II, {@15@}).—
Some further objections of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} are refuted by
{%Arjuna%} (II, {@16@}).—§ 275: The origin of {%Jarāsandha%} was the
following: The {%Magadha%} king {%Bṛhadratha%}, who had three
akṣauhiṇīs of troops, married the two twin daughters of
the king of {%Kāśi%}, making an engagement never to show
a preference for either. As he was childless he repaired
to the ṛṣi {%Caṇḍa-Kauśika%}, the son of {%Kākṣīvat Gautama%}, who
was sitting under a mango-tree. He gave a mango fruit
to the king, who gave it to his queens. They then brought
forth each one half of a child, which were thrown away,
but, found and laid together by the {%rākṣasī Jarā%}, became
one living child (II, {@17@}).—{%Jarā%} had been created by
{%Svayambhū%} for the destruction of the {%Dānavas%} and named
{%Gṛhadevī%} ({%gṛhe gṛhe manuṣyāṇāṃ nityaṃ tiṣṭhāmi rākṣasī%},
v. 730), and always lived in the king's house and did
him good, because there was on the walls a likeness of her
endued with youth and in the midst of children, and she was
daily worshipped with scents, etc. The king ordered a great
festival to be held in {%Magadha%} in honour of {%Jarā%}, and
named the boy {%Jarāsandha%} ({%Jarayā sandhito%}, v. 739) (II, {@18@}).
Some time after {%Caṇḍa-Kauśika%} again came to {%Magadha%}, and
foretold the greatness of {%Jarāsandha%}, that weapons should
not hurt him, and that he should see {%Rudra%}. After having
installed {%Jarāsandha, Bṛhadratha%} with his two wives retired
to the woods and, after practising ascetic penances, ascended
to heaven. When king {%Kaṃsa%} was slain by {%Vāsudeva%}
(i.e. Kṛṣṇa), {%Jarāsandha%}, from {%Girivraja%}, whirling a mace
ninety-nine times, hurled it towards {%Mathurā%}, where {%Kṛṣṇa%}
was residing at that time; the mace fell at {%Gadāvasāna%}, near
{%Mathurā%}, at a distance of ninety-nine {%yojanas%} [from Girivraja,
PCR.]. He, with {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka%} (who were skilled
[Page583-a+ 63]
in the {%nītiśāstra%}, v. 765), were more than a match for the
three worlds; therefore, from policy, the {%Kukuras, Andhakas%},
and {%Vṛṣṇis%}, chose not to fight with him (II, {@19@}).
