{@[Rājasūyārambhaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the beginning of
<div n="lb">the rājasūya sacrifice,” the 22nd of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Rājasūyasya ārambhaḥ.)—§ 272: {%Yudhiṣ-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṭhira%} consulted his counsellors, brothers, {%ṛtvijes,%} ministers,
[Page582-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Dhaumya, Dvaipāyana,%} etc., as to the {%rājasūya%} (“in which
<div n="lb">{%ṛṣis%} of austere vows establish six fires singing {%mantras%} of
<div n="lb">the {%Sāmaveda;%} at the conclusion thereof the performer,
<div n="lb">when installed in the sovereignty, is rewarded with the
<div n="lb">fruit of all sacrifices, including the {%darvīhomas%}”). They all
<div n="lb">encouraged him to perform it. All people lived happily
<div n="lb">under his sway and loved him (therefore he was called
<div n="lb">{%Ajātaśatru%}); {%Bhīma%} ruled over all men justly, {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">protected the people from enemies, {%Sahadeva%} administered
<div n="lb">justice impartially, {%Nakula%} behaved towards everybody with
<div n="lb">humility. There was no extortion, disease, etc. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">sent a messenger to {%Kṛṣṇa%} in {%Dvāravatī,%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} came to
<div n="lb">{%Indraprastha%} accompanied by {%Indrasena,%} and was consulted
<div n="lb">by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (II, {@13@}).—§ 273: {%Kṛṣṇa%} said that
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} in order to become {%samrāj,%} ought to slay the
<div n="lb">{%Magadha%} king {%Jarāsandha,%} and deliver the princes whom
<div n="lb">{%Jarāsandha%} held shut up in a mountain hole in order to
<div n="lb">sacrifice them to {%Mahādeva%} (i.e. Śiva). “The now existing
<div n="lb">{%kṣatriyas%} are descended from the remnants of those who
<div n="lb">were exterminated by {%Rāma.%} They represent themselves to
<div n="lb">be the descendants of {%Aila%} and {%Ikṣvāku;%} of those there are
<div n="lb">100 families. The {%Bhojas,%} descendants of {%Yayāti,%} are great
<div n="lb">and scattered all over the earth; but now {%Jarāsandha,%} ruling
<div n="lb">the middle land (i.e. Mathurā, Nīl.), has overpowered them.
<div n="lb">His allies are (1) {%Śiśupāla,%} who has become his {%senāpati;%}
<div n="lb">(2) the {%Karūṣa%} king {%Vakra,%} who fights by illusion
<div n="lb">{%(māyāyodhin);%} (3—4) {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka%} (see below);
<div n="lb">(5—8) {%Dantavakra, Karūṣa, Karabha, Meghavāhana;%} (9)
<div n="lb">{%Bhagadatta,%} the {%Yavana%} king, the ruler of the west, who
<div n="lb">bears on his head the most wonderful gem on earth, the
<div n="lb">old friend of thy father, and who chastises {%Muru%} and
<div n="lb">{%Naraka;%} he obeys {%Jarāsandha,%} but in his heart he is tied by
<div n="lb">affection to thee; (10) the king of {%Aṅga, Vaṅga, Puṇḍra,%}
<div n="lb">and of the {%Kirātas, Pauṇḍraka Vāsudeva,%} who among the
<div n="lb">{%Cedis%} is called {%Puruṣottama,%} and always bears, from
<div n="lb">foolishness, the distinctive signs of {%Kṛṣṇa;%} (11) {%Bhīṣmaka,%}
<div n="lb">king of the {%Bhojas,%} the friend of {%Indra,%} who governs
<div n="lb">a fourth part of the world, who by his learning has
<div n="lb">conquered the {%Pāṇḍyas, Krathas,%} and {%Kaiśikas,%} and whose
<div n="lb">brother {%Ākṛti%} is like to {%Rāma Jāmadagnya,%} has placed
<div n="lb">himself under {%Jarāsandha,%} though {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc., his relatives,
<div n="lb">are engaged every day in doing what is agreeable to him.
<div n="lb">Only {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} maternal uncle, the {%Kunti%} king {%Purujit,%}
<div n="lb">who has his dominions in the west and the south, regards
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with affection. The following peoples have fled
<div n="lb">for fear of {%Jarāsandha:%} (1) the eighteen tribes of the northern
<div n="lb">{%Bhojas%} have fled towards the west; (2—10) the {%Śūrasenas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhadrakāras, Bodhas, Śālvas, Paṭaccaras, Susthalas, Mukuṭṭas%}
<div n="lb">(B. Su°), {%Kulindas,%} and {%Kuntis;%} (11—13) the {%Śālvāyana%}
<div n="lb">kings with their brethren and followers, the southern
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas,%} and the eastern {%Kośalas,%} have all fled to the
<div n="lb">{%Kuntis(?);%} (14—15) the {%Matsyas%} and the {%Sannyastapādas%}
<div n="lb">(? so B.; C. Sanya°) have left their dominions in the north
<div n="lb">and fled into the southern country; (16) all the {%Pāñcālas%}
<div n="lb">have fled in all directions.” {%Jarāsandha's%} relations to the
<div n="lb">{%Yādavas%} were the following: {%Kaṃsa,%} having persecuted the
<div n="lb">{%Yādavas,%} married {%Asti%} and {%Prāpti,%} daughters of {%Jarāsandha%}
<div n="lb">and sisters of {%Sahadeva,%} and began also to oppress the old
<div n="lb">chiefs of the {%Bhojas,%} who sought the help of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc.;
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} bestowed upon {%Akrūra%} the daughter of {%Āhuka,%}
<div n="lb">and with {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%} (i.e. Balarāma) he slew {%Kaṃsa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Sunāman.%} Then {%Jarāsandha%} took up arms, and the eighteen
<div n="lb">tribes ({%kulair aṣṭādaśāvaraiḥ%} (?), differently Nīl.) thought
[Page582-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">they would be unable to check him even in 300 years.
<div n="lb">His friends {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka%} were incapable of being
<div n="lb">slain by weapons. Some other king, named {%Haṃsa%} (differently
<div n="lb">Nīl.), was slain by {%Rāma%} in the battle of the eighteen tribes
<div n="lb">{%(aṣṭādaśāvare?);%} then {%Ḍimbhaka,%} thinking that he could not
<div n="lb">live without {%Haṃsa,%} killed himself in the {%Yamunā,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Haṃsa,%} hearing that, also jumped into the {%Yamunā;%} then
<div n="lb">{%Jarāsandha%} returned to his kingdom, and the {%Yādavas%}
<div n="lb">continued to live at {%Mathurā.%} But the widow of {%Kaṃsa%}
<div n="lb">(PCR. {%Haṃsa%}), the daughter of {%Jarāsandha,%} urging him
<div n="lb">to revenge the death of her husband, the {%Yādavas%} fled
<div n="lb">from {%Mathurā,%} and took up their abode in {%Kuśasthalī%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Dvāravatī%}), adorned by {%Raivata,%} and strongly fortified
<div n="lb">the {%Gomanta%} mountains, three {%yojanas%} in length. “In the
<div n="lb">race of {%Kṛṣṇa%} there are 8,000 brothers [and cousins, PCR.].
<div n="lb">{%Āhuka%} has 100 sons. {%Cārudeṣṇa%} with his brother, {%Cakradeva,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki, Kṛṣṇa, Rauhiṇeya%} (i.e. {%Balarāma%}), and {%Śāmba%} (like
<div n="lb">{%Śauri%} in battle) are seven heroes {%(rathāḥ); Kṛtavarman,%}
<div n="lb">{%Anādhṛṣṭi, Śamīka, Samitiñjaya, Kaṅka, Śaṅku,%} and {%Kunti%}
<div n="lb">are seven {%mahārathas;%} then there are also two sons of
<div n="lb">{%Andhakabhoja%} and himself; all these heroes, remembering
<div n="lb">the middle country, are now living among the {%Vṛṣṇis%}”
<div n="lb">(II, {@14@}).—§ 274: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had some scruples, which
<div n="lb">were opposed by {%Bhīma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who cited from the
<div n="lb">{%Kṛta%} age five kings, who had become emperors {%(samrāj):%}
<div n="lb">{%Yauvanāśvi%} (i.e. {%Māndhātṛ%}) by the remission of taxes
<div n="lb">(B. {%jitvā jayyān,%} “by victories”), {%Bhagīratha%} by protection,
<div n="lb">[Arjuna-] {%Kārtavīrya%} by asceticism, {%Bharata%} by strength,
<div n="lb">and {%Marutta%} by prosperity; 100 families of kings have been
<div n="lb">unable to oppose {%Jarāsandha;%} he has already brought
<div n="lb">eighty-six kings to the house of {%Paśupati%} (i.e. Śiva); when
<div n="lb">he has fourteen more he will offer them as sacrifices (II, {@15@}).—
<div n="lb">Some further objections of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} are refuted by
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} (II, {@16@}).—§ 275: The origin of {%Jarāsandha%} was the
<div n="lb">following: The {%Magadha%} king {%Bṛhadratha,%} who had three
<div n="lb">akṣauhiṇīs of troops, married the two twin daughters of
<div n="lb">the king of {%Kāśi,%} making an engagement never to show
<div n="lb">a preference for either. As he was childless he repaired
<div n="lb">to the ṛṣi {%Caṇḍa-Kauśika,%} the son of {%Kākṣīvat Gautama,%} who
<div n="lb">was sitting under a mango-tree. He gave a mango fruit
<div n="lb">to the king, who gave it to his queens. They then brought
<div n="lb">forth each one half of a child, which were thrown away,
<div n="lb">but, found and laid together by the {%rākṣasī Jarā,%} became
<div n="lb">one living child (II, {@17@}).—{%Jarā%} had been created by
<div n="lb">{%Svayambhū%} for the destruction of the {%Dānavas%} and named
<div n="lb">{%Gṛhadevī%} ({%gṛhe gṛhe manuṣyāṇāṃ nityaṃ tiṣṭhāmi rākṣasī,%}
<div n="lb">v. 730), and always lived in the king's house and did
<div n="lb">him good, because there was on the walls a likeness of her
<div n="lb">endued with youth and in the midst of children, and she was
<div n="lb">daily worshipped with scents, etc. The king ordered a great
<div n="lb">festival to be held in {%Magadha%} in honour of {%Jarā,%} and
<div n="lb">named the boy {%Jarāsandha%} ({%Jarayā sandhito,%} v. 739) (II, {@18@}).
<div n="lb">Some time after {%Caṇḍa-Kauśika%} again came to {%Magadha,%} and
<div n="lb">foretold the greatness of {%Jarāsandha,%} that weapons should
<div n="lb">not hurt him, and that he should see {%Rudra.%} After having
<div n="lb">installed {%Jarāsandha, Bṛhadratha%} with his two wives retired
<div n="lb">to the woods and, after practising ascetic penances, ascended
<div n="lb">to heaven. When king {%Kaṃsa%} was slain by {%Vāsudeva%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Kṛṣṇa), {%Jarāsandha,%} from {%Girivraja,%} whirling a mace
<div n="lb">ninety-nine times, hurled it towards {%Mathurā,%} where {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">was residing at that time; the mace fell at {%Gadāvasāna,%} near
<div n="lb">{%Mathurā,%} at a distance of ninety-nine {%yojanas%} [from Girivraja,
<div n="lb">PCR.]. He, with {%Haṃsa%} and {%Ḍimbhaka%} (who were skilled
[Page583-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">in the {%nītiśāstra,%} v. 765), were more than a match for the
<div n="lb">three worlds; therefore, from policy, the {%Kukuras, Andhakas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Vṛṣṇis,%} chose not to fight with him (II, {@19@}).
