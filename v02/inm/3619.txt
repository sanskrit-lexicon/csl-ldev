{@Dīrghatamas,@}¦ a ṛṣi. § 170 (cf. Bhīṣma-Satyavatī-
<div n="lb">saṃvāda): {%Bhīṣma%} continued: The {%ṛṣi Utathya%} had a wife
<div n="lb">named {%Mamatā;%} his younger brother {%Bṛhaspati,%} the {%purohita%}
<div n="lb">of the gods, approached {%Mamatā,%} who by {%Utathya%} was
<div n="lb">pregnant with a child, who even while being in his mother's
<div n="lb">womb had studied the {%Vedas%} and the six {%Aṅgas.%} The
<div n="lb">embryo kicked him out with his foot, and the semen fell
<div n="lb">upon the earth. {%Bṛhaspati%} cursed him; so he was born blind,
<div n="lb">and came to be called {%Dīrghatamas (“tamo dīrghaṃ pra-%}
<div n="lb">{%vekṣyasi”).%} The wife of {%Dīrghatamas%} was a {%brāhmaṇī,%}
[Page255-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Pradveṣī%} by name. With her he begat {%Gautama%} and other
<div n="lb">sons; and he {%(Dīrghatamas),%} who knew the {%Vedas%} and {%Angas,%}
<div n="lb">having learnt the {%Godharma%} (i.e. {%prakāśamaithuna,%} Nīl.)
<div n="lb">from {%Saurabheya%} (i.e. son of the {%Kāmadhenu,%} Nīl.) began to
<div n="lb">practise it. He therefore was excluded by the {%ṛṣis%} from
<div n="lb">the asylum, and accosted in harsh words by his wife, who
<div n="lb">said that she would no more support him and his children.
<div n="lb">{%Dīrghatamas%} then established the rule that from that day
<div n="lb">every woman should have to adhere to one husband for
<div n="lb">life, whether he were dead or alive, etc. She then caused
<div n="lb">her sons to tie him on a raft and throw him into the {%Gangā.%}
<div n="lb">Drifting along, he passed through the territories of many
<div n="lb">kings, until he was taken up by king {%Bali,%} who wanted
<div n="lb">him to raise up offspring. But {%Bali's%} queen {%Sudeṣṇā,%}
<div n="lb">who saw that he was blind, sent a {%Śūdra%} woman in her stead,
<div n="lb">who was her nurse, with whom the {%ṛṣi%} begat eleven sons,
<div n="lb">{%Kākṣīvat,%} etc. As these sons were his own and not {%Bali's,%}
<div n="lb">{%Bali%} sent {%Sudeṣṇā%} to him, and {%Dīrghatamas,%} after merely
<div n="lb">touching her person, told her: “Thou shalt have five
<div n="lb">children named {%Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Puṇḍra,%} and {%Suhma.%}”
<div n="lb">Their dominions have come to be called after their names:
<div n="lb">I, {@104,@} 4192, 4198, (4202), 4218.—§ 266 (Śakrasabhāv.):
<div n="lb">II, {@7,@} 293 (in the palace of Indra).—§ 717{%b%} (Nārāyaṇīya):
<div n="lb">XII, {@342,@} 13182 (originally he, on account of his blindness,
<div n="lb">was called {%D.,%} but when he had been cured by invoking
<div n="lb">Nārāyaṇa as Keśava, he was called Gotama).—§ 775 (Ānu-
