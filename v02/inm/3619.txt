{@Dīrghatamas@},¦ a ṛṣi. § 170 (cf. Bhīṣma-Satyavatī-
saṃvāda): {%Bhīṣma%} continued: The {%ṛṣi Utathya%} had a wife
named {%Mamatā%}; his younger brother {%Bṛhaspati%}, the {%purohita%}
of the gods, approached {%Mamatā%}, who by {%Utathya%} was
pregnant with a child, who even while being in his mother's
womb had studied the {%Vedas%} and the six {%Aṅgas%}. The
embryo kicked him out with his foot, and the semen fell
upon the earth. {%Bṛhaspati%} cursed him; so he was born blind,
and came to be called {%Dīrghatamas (“tamo dīrghaṃ pra-%}
{%vekṣyasi”%}). The wife of {%Dīrghatamas%} was a {%brāhmaṇī%},
[Page255-b+ 63]
{%Pradveṣī%} by name. With her he begat {%Gautama%} and other
sons; and he ({%Dīrghatamas%}), who knew the {%Vedas%} and {%Angas%},
having learnt the {%Godharma%} (i.e. {%prakāśamaithuna%}, Nīl.)
from {%Saurabheya%} (i.e. son of the {%Kāmadhenu%}, Nīl.) began to
practise it. He therefore was excluded by the {%ṛṣis%} from
the asylum, and accosted in harsh words by his wife, who
said that she would no more support him and his children.
{%Dīrghatamas%} then established the rule that from that day
every woman should have to adhere to one husband for
life, whether he were dead or alive, etc. She then caused
her sons to tie him on a raft and throw him into the {%Gangā%}.
Drifting along, he passed through the territories of many
kings, until he was taken up by king {%Bali%}, who wanted
him to raise up offspring. But {%Bali's%} queen {%Sudeṣṇā%},
who saw that he was blind, sent a {%Śūdra%} woman in her stead,
who was her nurse, with whom the {%ṛṣi%} begat eleven sons,
{%Kākṣīvat%}, etc. As these sons were his own and not {%Bali's%},
{%Bali%} sent {%Sudeṣṇā%} to him, and {%Dīrghatamas%}, after merely
touching her person, told her: “Thou shalt have five
children named {%Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Puṇḍra%}, and {%Suhma%}.”
Their dominions have come to be called after their names:
I, {@104@}, 4192, 4198, (4202), 4218.—§ 266 (Śakrasabhāv.):
II, {@7@}, 293 (in the palace of Indra).—§ 717{%b%} (Nārāyaṇīya):
XII, {@342@}, 13182 (originally he, on account of his blindness,
was called {%D.%}, but when he had been cured by invoking
Nārāyaṇa as Keśava, he was called Gotama).—§ 775 (Ānu-
śāsanik.): XIII, {@166@}<lang n="greek">ε</lang>, 7668 (among the ṛṣis of the west).
