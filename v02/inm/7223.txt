<div n="lb">vatāraṇa): When {%Girikā's%} season came, the pitṛs of {%Vasu%}
<div n="lb">(q.v.) asked him to slay deer; when he in the forest was
<div n="lb">longing for {%Girikā,%} he gave his semen, enveloped by an
<div n="lb">aśoka leaf, to a hawk in order that it should be carried
<div n="lb">to {%Girikā;%} persecuted by another hawk, the hawk let the
<div n="lb">semen fall into the {%Yamunā,%} where it was swallowed by
<div n="lb">the Apsaras {%Adrikā,%} who had by the curse of a brahman
<div n="lb">been transformed into a fish. In the tenth month the fish
<div n="lb">was caught, and out of its womb came a boy, who was
<div n="lb">given to {%Uparicara%} and afterwards became the king {%Matsya,%}
<div n="lb">and a girl, {%Satyavatī,%} who was of a fishy smell, and was
<div n="lb">retained by the fisherman. When killed, {%Adrikā%} assumed
<div n="lb">her own celestial shape and went away to the regions of the
<div n="lb">{%Siddhas,%} the {%Ṛṣis,%} and the {%Cāraṇas:%} I, {@63,@} 2393 {%(rājā).%}—
