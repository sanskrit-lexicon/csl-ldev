[{@Tulādhāra-Jājali-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation
<div n="lb">of Tulādhāra with Jājali”). § 680{%b%} (Mokṣadh.). {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">said: There was once a brahman {%Jājali,%} living in a forest;
<div n="lb">he proceeded to the sea-shore and practised penances
<div n="lb">(description) for many years. Living within the waters he
<div n="lb">roamed through all the worlds with the speed of mind.
<div n="lb">Once, unseen by Ra., he thought: “there is none equal to
<div n="lb">me”; Pś. said to him that even the celebrated {%Tulādhāra%}
[Page684-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">(engaged in buying and selling) was not worthy of saying
<div n="lb">such words. Ṛ. wished to see {%Tulādhāra;%} Ra. raised him
<div n="lb">from the sea and showed him the road. Arrived at {%Vārāṇasī,%}
<div n="lb">he met {%Tulādhāra%} and spoke to him thus(!). Asked by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} described those difficult feats that
<div n="lb">{%Jājali%} had performed before; while he stood as a wooden
<div n="lb">post rapt in {%yoga,%} a pair of {%kuliṅga%} birds ({%caṭakān,%} v. 9317)
<div n="lb">built their nest on his head, laid their eggs there, their young
<div n="lb">ones came out, and only when the latter did not come back,
<div n="lb">even after a month, {%Jājali%} left that spot. Then he began to
<div n="lb">slap his armpits and proclaim loudly: “I have won great
<div n="lb">merit.” Then an invisible voice in the sky said: “Thou art
<div n="lb">not equal to the wise {%Tulādhāra%} at {%Vārāṇasī;%} even he is not
<div n="lb">fit to say what thou sayest.” {%Jājali,%} filled with wrath and
<div n="lb">desirous of meeting with {%Tulādhāra,%} began to roam over the
<div n="lb">whole earth, observing the vow of silence and passing the
<div n="lb">night at that spot where evening overtook him. After a
<div n="lb">considerable time he reached {%Vārāṇasī%} and saw {%Tulādhāra%}
<div n="lb">engaged in selling miscellaneous articles {%(paṇyāni). Tulā-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhāra%} stood up and saluted him, mentioning his dealings with
<div n="lb">the birds, etc. (XII, {@262@}). Asked by {%Jājali,%} the {%vaiśya%}
<div n="lb">{%Tulādhāra%} discoursed to him upon the ways of morality;
<div n="lb">“in every creature that is endued with the five senses live
<div n="lb">all the deities, {%Sūrya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the goat is {%Agni;%} the sheep
<div n="lb">is {%Varuṇa;%} the horse is {%Sūrya;%} Earth is {%Virāj;%} the cow and
<div n="lb">the calf are {%Soma;%} the man that sells these can never obtain
<div n="lb">success…In days of yore many Ṛ. (and {%Yatis%}) rebuked
<div n="lb">{%Nahuṣa%} for having slain a cow (which is declared in the
<div n="lb">scriptures to be like unto one's mother) and a bull (which is
<div n="lb">declared to be like to the Creator himself); in order to purify
<div n="lb">{%Nahuṣa,%} however, they divided that sin in 101 parts, and
<div n="lb">converting the fragments into diseases, threw them among all
<div n="lb">creatures, but declared that they should not be able to pour
<div n="lb">libations in his sacrifice” (XIII, {@263@}). {%Jājali%} said that
<div n="lb">{%Tulādhāra's%} doctrines smacked of atheism, which the latter
<div n="lb">denied, discoursing on sacrifice, saying that brahmans,
<div n="lb">having given up the sacrifice ordained for them (i.e. Yoga),
<div n="lb">had betaken themselves to the performance of sacrifices that
<div n="lb">are for {%kṣatriyas%} (i.e. all other sacrifices). “Instead of all
<div n="lb">animals the rice-ball is a worthy offering in sacrifices; all
<div n="lb">rivers are as sacred as the {%Sarasvatī,%} and all mountains are
<div n="lb">sacred; the soul is itself a {%tīrtha;%} do not wander about on
<div n="lb">the earth to visit sacred places” (XII, {@264@}). {%Tulādhāra%}
<div n="lb">caused {%Jājali%} to summon the birds that had been reared by
<div n="lb">the latter; they made answer agreeably to the religion of
<div n="lb">{%ahiṃsā%} (Nīl.). “Faith is the daughter of {%Sūrya,%} etc.,”
<div n="lb">quoting a verse sung by {%Brahmán,%} exalting Faith; “the food
<div n="lb">of a liberal usurer is acceptable, but not the food of a miser;
<div n="lb">…want of faith is a high sin; faith is a cleanser of sins.”
<div n="lb">After a short while, {%Tulādhāra%} and {%Jājali%} both ascended to
<div n="lb">heaven. Many truths of this kind were spoken of by
<div n="lb">{%Tulādhāra; Jājali,%} having heard his words, betook himself
<div n="lb">to tranquillity (XII, {@265@}).
