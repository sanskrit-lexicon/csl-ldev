[{@Tulādhāra-Jājali-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation
of Tulādhāra with Jājali”). § 680{%b%} (Mokṣadh.). {%Bhīṣma%}
said: There was once a brahman {%Jājali%}, living in a forest;
he proceeded to the sea-shore and practised penances
(description) for many years. Living within the waters he
roamed through all the worlds with the speed of mind.
Once, unseen by Ra., he thought: “there is none equal to
me”; Pś. said to him that even the celebrated {%Tulādhāra%}
[Page684-a+ 63]
(engaged in buying and selling) was not worthy of saying
such words. Ṛ. wished to see {%Tulādhāra%}; Ra. raised him
from the sea and showed him the road. Arrived at {%Vārāṇasī%},
he met {%Tulādhāra%} and spoke to him thus(!). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} described those difficult feats that
{%Jājali%} had performed before; while he stood as a wooden
post rapt in {%yoga%}, a pair of {%kuliṅga%} birds ({%caṭakān%}, v. 9317)
built their nest on his head, laid their eggs there, their young
ones came out, and only when the latter did not come back,
even after a month, {%Jājali%} left that spot. Then he began to
slap his armpits and proclaim loudly: “I have won great
merit.” Then an invisible voice in the sky said: “Thou art
not equal to the wise {%Tulādhāra%} at {%Vārāṇasī%}; even he is not
fit to say what thou sayest.” {%Jājali%}, filled with wrath and
desirous of meeting with {%Tulādhāra%}, began to roam over the
whole earth, observing the vow of silence and passing the
night at that spot where evening overtook him. After a
considerable time he reached {%Vārāṇasī%} and saw {%Tulādhāra%}
engaged in selling miscellaneous articles ({%paṇyāni). Tulā-%}
{%dhāra%} stood up and saluted him, mentioning his dealings with
the birds, etc. (XII, {@262@}). Asked by {%Jājali%}, the {%vaiśya%}
{%Tulādhāra%} discoursed to him upon the ways of morality;
“in every creature that is endued with the five senses live
all the deities, {%Sūrya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); the goat is {%Agni%}; the sheep
is {%Varuṇa%}; the horse is {%Sūrya%}; Earth is {%Virāj%}; the cow and
the calf are {%Soma%}; the man that sells these can never obtain
success…In days of yore many Ṛ. (and {%Yatis%}) rebuked
{%Nahuṣa%} for having slain a cow (which is declared in the
scriptures to be like unto one's mother) and a bull (which is
declared to be like to the Creator himself); in order to purify
{%Nahuṣa%}, however, they divided that sin in 101 parts, and
converting the fragments into diseases, threw them among all
creatures, but declared that they should not be able to pour
libations in his sacrifice” (XIII, {@263@}). {%Jājali%} said that
{%Tulādhāra's%} doctrines smacked of atheism, which the latter
denied, discoursing on sacrifice, saying that brahmans,
having given up the sacrifice ordained for them (i.e. Yoga),
had betaken themselves to the performance of sacrifices that
are for {%kṣatriyas%} (i.e. all other sacrifices). “Instead of all
animals the rice-ball is a worthy offering in sacrifices; all
rivers are as sacred as the {%Sarasvatī%}, and all mountains are
sacred; the soul is itself a {%tīrtha%}; do not wander about on
the earth to visit sacred places” (XII, {@264@}). {%Tulādhāra%}
caused {%Jājali%} to summon the birds that had been reared by
the latter; they made answer agreeably to the religion of
{%ahiṃsā%} (Nīl.). “Faith is the daughter of {%Sūrya%}, etc.,”
quoting a verse sung by {%Brahmán%}, exalting Faith; “the food
of a liberal usurer is acceptable, but not the food of a miser;
…want of faith is a high sin; faith is a cleanser of sins.”
After a short while, {%Tulādhāra%} and {%Jājali%} both ascended to
heaven. Many truths of this kind were spoken of by
{%Tulādhāra; Jājali%}, having heard his words, betook himself
to tranquillity (XII, {@265@}).
