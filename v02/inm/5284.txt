{@[Kāmyakavanapraveśa(ḥ)]@}¦ (“proceeding to the Kām-
yaka-wood,” cf. Arjunābhigamanap.). § 328: As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
declared that {%Bhūriśravas, Śala, Jalasandha%}, etc., and {%Karṇa%}
(master of all weapons, etc.), and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, together
with the kings who had been injured by the {%Pāṇḍavas%},
could not now be vanquished, that all the {%Kaurava%} soldiers
and their families had been honoured with wealth and
luxuries by {%Duryodhana%}, and would sacrifice their lives for
him, and that, although {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, and {%Kṛpa%}, all
knowing celestial weapons and being invincible, behaved
equally towards both parties, they would certainly, to pay off
the royal favours they enjoyed, lay down their very lives
in battle, {%Bhīma%} remained silent.—§ 329: While they were
conversing thus {%Vyāsa%} appeared, and, taking {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} into
a corner, taught him, after he had purified himself ({%śuddhaye%}),
the science of {%Pratismṛti%}, by means of which {%Arjuna%} ({%b%}) should
[Page380-b+ 63]
proceed to {%Mahendra, Rudra, Varuṇa, Kubera%}, and {%Yama%}, to receive
weapons from them. He also advised him to go to some other
forest in order not to cause uneasiness to the ascetics and
exterminate the deer and destroy the plants. Then {%Vyāsa%}
disappeared. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} went to the forest of {%Kāmyaka%}
on the banks of the {%Sarasvatī%}, followed by numerous brahmans
versed in {%śikṣā%} and {%akṣara%} (see § 322), and lived there
devoted to the {%Dhanurveda%}, and sacrificing to the {%Pitṛs%}, the
gods, and the brahmans (III, {@36@}).
