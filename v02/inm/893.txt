{%Ādityatīrtha%} Ṛ. {%A.D%}. lived in days of yore, observant of the
duties of a householder (description); he always practised the
vow of {%brahmacarya%}. Once the ascetic mendicant ({%bhikṣukaḥ%}).
{%Jaigīṣavya%}, devoted to {%yoga%}, came to {%Devala's%} hermitage and
attained to success ({%siddhiṃ). Devala%} always kept his eyes
on him. After a long time, {%Devala%} on one occasion lost
sight of {%Jaigīṣavya%}; at the hour of dinner, however, he
approached {%Devala%} in order to solicit alms, and {%D%}. worshipped
him, after the rites laid down by Ṛ., for many years; but
{%Jaigīṣavya%} never spoke a single word to him. {%D%}. proceeded
to the shore of the ocean, journeying through the welkin and
bearing his earthen jug with him; there he saw {%Jaigīṣavya%}
who had arrived there before him, at which M.-ṛ. {%A%}. wondered
much. Having finished his ablutions and silent prayers,
{%D%}. returned to his hermitage, bearing with him his earthen
vessel filled with water. Entering his own hermitage, he saw
{%Jaigīṣavya%} seated there. {%D%}. then soared aloft into the sky in
order to ascertain who {%Jaigīṣavya%} really was. He saw crowds
of sky-ranging Si. rapt in meditation, and he saw {%Jaigīṣavya%},
reverentially worshipped by them, and he became filled with
wonder at the sight. He saw {%Jaigīṣavya%} set out for the
{%Pitṛloka > Yāmyaloka%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>). At last he was seen to pass
into the regions of the {%brahmasattvins%}, then through three other
regions to those of chaste women and such as are devoted
to their husbands. At this point {%A%}. lost sight of him, and
[Page094-b+ 63]
enquiring of the foremost of Si. in the regions of the
{%brahmasattvins%}, he was told that {%Jaigīṣavya%} had gone to the
eternal region ({%loka%}) of {%Brahman. A%}. endeavoured to soar
aloft; but he soon fell down, and the Si. declared that
he was not worthy to proceed thither. {%D%}. came down,
descending from one region to another in due order, to his
hermitage, where he again beheld {%Jaigīṣavya%}, who taught
him the religion of Emancipation ({%mokṣa%}) and the ordinances
of {%yoga%}, etc., and performed all the acts according to the rites
for that end. Then all creatures with P. began to weep,
saying, “Who will henceforth give us food?” {%D%}. then
thought of renouncing the religion of {%mokṣa%}; then all kinds
of fruits and roots, etc., began to weep, saying, “The wicked-
hearted {%D%}. will once more pluck and eat us, having once
assured all creatures of his perfect harmlessness.” Then
{%D%}. abandoned the religion of a householder and adopted that
of {%mokṣa%}, and obtained the highest success ({%siddhi%}) and the
highest {%yoga. D%}. with Bṛh. applauded {%Jaigīṣavya%}; only
{%Nārada%} contradicted.—§ 621 (Rājadh.): XII, {@1@}, 34 ({%D.%}).—
