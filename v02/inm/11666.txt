{@Vasiṣṭhāpavāha@}¦ (“the carrying away of Vasiṣṭha”),
name of a tīrtha. § 615 (Baladevatīrthayātrā): IX, {@41@}, †2357;
{@42@}, †2358.—§ 615{%p%} (do.): A great enmity arose between
{%Viśvāmitra%} and {%Vasiṣṭha%}, due to their rivalry in respect of
ascetic austerities. The hermitage of {%Vasiṣṭha%} was in
{%Sthāṇutīrtha%}, on the bank of the {%Sarasvatī%}; on the opposite
bank was the hermitage of {%Viśvāmitra%}. There (i.e. in
{%Sthāṇutīrtha%}) {%Sthāṇu%} had practised penances, and having
performed a sacrifice and worshipped the {%Sarasvatī%} he had
established that tīrtha, and there the gods in days of yore
installed {%Skanda%}. In that tīrtha on the {%Sarasvatī%}, the {%ṛṣi%}
{%Viśvāmitra%}, by his penances, disturbed {%Vasiṣṭha. Viśvāmitra%}
and {%Vasiṣṭha%} every day challenged each other in respect of
the superiority of their penances. {%Viśvāmitra%} ordered the
{%Sarasvatī%}, notwithstanding her trembling, to bring {%Vasiṣṭha%}
into his presence, that he might slay him. {%Vasiṣṭha%}
willingly let her do so, lest {%Viśvāmitra%} should curse her.
{%Sarasvatī%} washed away one of her banks and bore {%Vasiṣṭha%}
(who praised the {%Sarasvatī (q%})) away and informed {%Kauśika%}
(i.e. {%Viśvāmitra%}) about his arrival; but while {%Viśvāmitra%}
was looking for a weapon she quickly bore {%Vasiṣṭha%} back to
the eastern bank. {%Viśvāmitra%} cursed her, saying that her
current should be changed into blood, which is acceptable only
to the {%Rākṣasas%}. For a whole year she then flowed bearing
blood mixed with water. The gods, the {%Gandharvas%}, and the
{%Apsarases%} grieved. For this reason the tīrtha came to be
called {%V. Sarasvatī%}, however, once more got back her own
proper condition (IX, {@42@}), when some {%munis%} on a {%tīrthayātrā%}
to the {%Sarasvatī%}, having bathed in all her tīrthas came to {%V%}.
and saw the water mixed with blood, and that innumerable
{%Rākṣasas%} were drinking it. Having learnt the cause, they
[Page716-b+ 63]
worshipped {%Mahādeva%} with penances and purified the
{%Sarasvatī%}. The {%Rākṣasas%}, who were {%Brahma-Rākṣasas%}
(so those among {%vaiśyas, śūdras%}, and {%kṣatriyas%}, who hate
and injure the brahmans, become {%Rākṣasas%}), afflicted with
hunger, sought the protection of the {%munis%}, who, having
ordained what should be the food of the {%Rākṣasas (r%})
solicited the {%Sarasvatī%}, who assumed a new shape called
{%Aruṇā%}; bathing in that new river the {%Rākṣasas%} abandoned
their bodies and went to heaven. Ascertaining all this,
{%Indra(s%}) bathed there and became purified of a grievous sin
(i.e. {%brahmahatyā%}): IX, {@42@}, 2398.
