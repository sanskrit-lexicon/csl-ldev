{@Vasiṣṭhāpavāha@}¦ (“the carrying away of Vasiṣṭha”),
<div n="lb">name of a tīrtha. § 615 (Baladevatīrthayātrā): IX, {@41,@} †2357;
<div n="lb">{@42,@} †2358.—§ 615{%p%} (do.): A great enmity arose between
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra%} and {%Vasiṣṭha,%} due to their rivalry in respect of
<div n="lb">ascetic austerities. The hermitage of {%Vasiṣṭha%} was in
<div n="lb">{%Sthāṇutīrtha,%} on the bank of the {%Sarasvatī;%} on the opposite
<div n="lb">bank was the hermitage of {%Viśvāmitra.%} There (i.e. in
<div n="lb">{%Sthāṇutīrtha%}) {%Sthāṇu%} had practised penances, and having
<div n="lb">performed a sacrifice and worshipped the {%Sarasvatī%} he had
<div n="lb">established that tīrtha, and there the gods in days of yore
<div n="lb">installed {%Skanda.%} In that tīrtha on the {%Sarasvatī,%} the {%ṛṣi%}
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāmitra,%} by his penances, disturbed {%Vasiṣṭha. Viśvāmitra%}
<div n="lb">and {%Vasiṣṭha%} every day challenged each other in respect of
<div n="lb">the superiority of their penances. {%Viśvāmitra%} ordered the
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī,%} notwithstanding her trembling, to bring {%Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">into his presence, that he might slay him. {%Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">willingly let her do so, lest {%Viśvāmitra%} should curse her.
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī%} washed away one of her banks and bore {%Vasiṣṭha%}
<div n="lb">(who praised the {%Sarasvatī (q)%}) away and informed {%Kauśika%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Viśvāmitra%}) about his arrival; but while {%Viśvāmitra%}
<div n="lb">was looking for a weapon she quickly bore {%Vasiṣṭha%} back to
<div n="lb">the eastern bank. {%Viśvāmitra%} cursed her, saying that her
<div n="lb">current should be changed into blood, which is acceptable only
<div n="lb">to the {%Rākṣasas.%} For a whole year she then flowed bearing
<div n="lb">blood mixed with water. The gods, the {%Gandharvas,%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Apsarases%} grieved. For this reason the tīrtha came to be
<div n="lb">called {%V. Sarasvatī,%} however, once more got back her own
<div n="lb">proper condition (IX, {@42@}), when some {%munis%} on a {%tīrthayātrā%}
<div n="lb">to the {%Sarasvatī,%} having bathed in all her tīrthas came to {%V.%}
<div n="lb">and saw the water mixed with blood, and that innumerable
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasas%} were drinking it. Having learnt the cause, they
[Page716-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">worshipped {%Mahādeva%} with penances and purified the
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī.%} The {%Rākṣasas,%} who were {%Brahma-Rākṣasas%}
<div n="lb">(so those among {%vaiśyas, śūdras,%} and {%kṣatriyas,%} who hate
<div n="lb">and injure the brahmans, become {%Rākṣasas%}), afflicted with
<div n="lb">hunger, sought the protection of the {%munis,%} who, having
<div n="lb">ordained what should be the food of the {%Rākṣasas (r)%}
<div n="lb">solicited the {%Sarasvatī,%} who assumed a new shape called
<div n="lb">{%Aruṇā;%} bathing in that new river the {%Rākṣasas%} abandoned
<div n="lb">their bodies and went to heaven. Ascertaining all this,
<div n="lb">{%Indra(s)%} bathed there and became purified of a grievous sin
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%brahmahatyā%}): IX, {@42,@} 2398.
