at the tīrtha {%Prabhāsa%}; (6) {%Vyāsa%} had told that {%K%}. was the
cause of the creation, etc.; (7) he slew {%Naraka Bhauma%} and
took his ear-rings, and then let loose the first sacrificial
horse; (8) he slew all the {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas%} and bestowed
on {%Indra%} the sovereignty of the universe; (9) he took birth
[Page415-b+ 63]
among men; (10) having been {%Nārāyaṇa%}, he became {%Hari%},
{%Brahmán, Sūrya, Dharma, Dhātṛ, Yama, Anala, Vāyu%},
{%Vaiśravaṇa, Rudra, Kāla%}, the firmament ({%khaṃ%}), the earth,

he gratified the highest god with sacrifices and at each sacrifice
he offered gold by hundreds of thousands; (12) becoming
{%Viṣṇu%}, the son of {%Aditi%}, and the younger brother of {%Indra%},
he, even while a child, pervaded, in three steps, the heaven, the
firmament, and the earth, and, standing in the abode of the
Sun ({%Ādityasadane%}, B. however has {%Ādityasyandane%}, i.e. in

{%tāṃ%}) and will again submerge it within the ocean; (22) at

drawn the whole universe into his own self; (23) in the
beginning of the {%yuga%} Brahmán sprung from the lotus of his
navel; (24) when the Dānavas {%Madhu%} and {%Kaiṭabha%} were

forehead {%Śambhu%} (i.e. {%Śiva%}), the holder of the trident
({%Śūlapāṇiḥ%}) with three eyes ({%Trilocanaḥ%}); thus these two
foremost deities (i.e. Brahmán and Śiva) had sprung from his
body to do his work; this Nārada had told; (25) the deeds
he performed when a boy, assisted by {%Baladeva%}, never had
been done nor would be done by others; (26) he dwelt on
{%Kailāsa%} together with brahmans.—{%K%}. said to Arjuna: “Thou
