§ 773{%c%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Kṛṣṇa%} said: [Formerly] I put up in
my house the brahman {%Durvāsas%}, who was green and tawny,
clad in rags ({%cīravāsāḥ%}), who had a stick of {%Bilva (Ægle%}
{%marmelos%}, Linn.), a long beard, who was emaciated, taller
than the tallest men; he wandered over all the celestial and
human worlds, singing this verse at congregations and in public
squares: “Who would cause the brahman {%D%}. to dwell in his
house? He becomes enraged with everyone even at the
slightest transgression; he that would give me shelter should
not anger me.” As no one took notice of him (read with B.
{%°n nādriyate%}), I invited him. Sometimes he would eat food
sufficient for many thousand persons, sometimes very little,
and [sometimes] he would not return home; he would laugh
and weep without any visible reason; no one at that time was
equal to him in years; [one day] he burnt all the beds and
coverlets and all the well-adorned damsels, and then went
out; then he asked for rice-milk ({%pāyasa%}); having previously
caused every kind of food and drink to be kept ready,
I caused hot rice-milk to be brought; having eaten some, he
ordered me to smear my limbs with the remnant, which I did;
then he smeared {%Rukmiṇī%}, and causing her to be yoked to
a chariot, he, ascending that chariot, set out of my house,
striking her with the hook, and proceeded along the high
road; the {%Dāśarhas%} became angry; as {%Rukmiṇī%} tottered, he
struck her [with the whip]; then he leapt down from the
chariot and fled towards the south on foot, followed by us.
Then he became gratified because I had subdued my anger,
and said: “As long as gods and men will continue to
entertain a liking for food, so long will everyone among
them cherish the same liking for thee; so long as there
will be righteous [men] ({%puṇyāḥ%}) in the worlds, so long
will thy fame last; agreeable thou shalt be to all persons;
whatever articles of thine have been broken or burnt or
destroyed, thou shalt see restored or even better; thou
wilt have no fear of death through such parts of thy body
as have been smeared [with the rice-milk]; thou ought
to have smeared also the soles of thy feet.” I saw my body
endued with great beauty and splendour. He also blessed
{%Rukmiṇī%}, saying: “Thou shalt be the foremost of women in
fame, etc., free from decrepitude or diseases or loss of
complexion, possessed of a fragrant odour, the foremost of
{%Kṛṣṇa's%} 60,000 wives, and [after death] thou shalt dwell in
the same world as {%Kṛṣṇa%}.” Having recommended me to be
always thus disposed towards the brahmans, he disappeared.
I and {%Rukmiṇī%} took the vow of always satisfying the brahmans.
Having entered our house, I saw that everything which {%D%}. had
broken or burnt had become renewed. From that day forth
I have always worshipped the brahmans: XIII, {@160@}, 7416,

Śiva).—§ 789 (Putradarśanap.): XV, {@30@}, 820 (repetition
from § 131).—§ 793 (Mausalap.): XVI, {@4@}, †123 (had
made Kṛṣṇa invulnerable except on the soles of the feet,
cf. § 773{%c%}). Cf. Atreya (XVI, †124).
