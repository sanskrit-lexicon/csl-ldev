[{@Sainyodyogaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating to
<div n="lb">the preparations before warfare,” the 57th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of Mhbhr.). § 554: After the nuptials of {%Abhimanyu%}
<div n="lb">the {%Kurus,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) next morning assembled in the presence
<div n="lb">chamber of {%Virāṭa. Kṛṣṇa%} spoke about the affairs of the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} and proposed to send an ambassador to {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">etc., in order to induce them to give half the kingdom to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (V, {@1@}). {%Baladeva%} approved of it, and said that
<div n="lb">the ambassador ought to salute {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), that
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had been wrong in challenging {%Śakuni,%} and
<div n="lb">that {%Duryodhana%} only ought to be addressed in a conciliatory
<div n="lb">tone, that war might be avoided (V, {@2@}). {%Sātyaki%} severely
<div n="lb">blamed {%Baladeva,%} and asserted that it was {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} who
<div n="lb">had been challenged in the game at dice, that he could not
<div n="lb">have declined according to the rules of the Kṣatriya caste,
[Page609-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">and that {%Śakuni%} had won by a trick; the {%Kauravas%} had not
<div n="lb">obeyed {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa;%} they ought to be besought by
<div n="lb">sharp arrows; they could not withstand {%Yuyudhāna,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@3@}). {%Drupada%} approved of what had been said by
<div n="lb">{%Baladeva,%} except that {%Duryodhana%} should not be addressed
<div n="lb">mildly, and they ought also to send messengers to {%Śalya,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) to collect an army; his own {%purohita%} ought to be sent to
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Duryodhana, Bhīṣma,%} and {%Droṇa%} (V, {@4@}).
<div n="lb">Having approved of {%Drupada's%} words, {%Kṛṣṇa%} set out for
<div n="lb">{%Dvārakā,%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} began to
<div n="lb">make preparations for war, and collect troops; and {%Drupada%}
<div n="lb">despatched his {%purohita%} to the {%Kurus%} (V, {@5@}). {%Drupada%} gave
<div n="lb">instructions to his {%purohita%} (cf. Puṣya, § 554), who set
<div n="lb">out for {%Hāstinapura%} with a following of disciples (V, {@6@}).
<div n="lb">After {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) had set out for {%Dvārakā, Arjuna%} and
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} come thither, while {%Kṛṣṇa%} was asleep;
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} sat down at the head of the bed; after him
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} came and stood at the back of the bed. And when
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} awoke, he first saw {%Arjuna. Arjuna%} chose for his
<div n="lb">partner {%Kṛṣṇa%} himself, who was not to fight; {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">selected for himself {%Kṛṣṇa's%} ten crores of {%Nārāyaṇa%} cowherds.
<div n="lb">{%Balarāma%} said he would fight neither for {%Kuntī's%} sons
<div n="lb">nor for {%Duryodhana. Kṛtavarman%} gave an {%akṣauhiṇī%} to
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana. Kṛṣṇa%} promised to become {%Arjuna's%} charioteer;
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} came back to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and the
<div n="lb">flower of the {%Daśārha%} race (V, {@7@}).—§ 555: {%Śalya%} with his
<div n="lb">sons and troops (description) was advancing in order to join
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} but {%Duryodhana%} caused fine palaces of
<div n="lb">entertainment to be constructed at different spots for his
<div n="lb">reception; {%Śalya%} first thought this had been arranged by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} until {%Duryodhana%} came forward and showed
<div n="lb">himself; then he promised {%Duryodhana%} to become the
<div n="lb">leader of his army. {%Śalya,%} however, first proceeded to the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} at {%Upaplavya,%} and told them about the matter.
<div n="lb">He promised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that when he became {%Karṇa's%}
<div n="lb">charioteer he would act so that {%Karṇa%} might be dispirited;
<div n="lb">and in order to comfort {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} he reminded him that
<div n="lb">{%Śakra (Indra)%} had to endure, together with his wife, very great
<div n="lb">misery (V, {@8@}). At the request of {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Śalya%} related
<div n="lb">the ancient story {%(itihāsaṃ purātanaṃ)%} of the great misery
<div n="lb">endured by {%Indra%} and his queen (v. Indravijaya) (V, {@9—17@}).
<div n="lb">So {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should also regain his kingdom. This story
<div n="lb">of the victory of {%Indra,%} equal to the {%Veda,%} should be listened to
<div n="lb">by a king desirous of victory; he who reads it with a heart
<div n="lb">full of religious faith is purified from his sins, etc. {%Śalya%}
<div n="lb">repeated his promise to damp the spirits of {%Karṇa,%} and went
<div n="lb">with his army to {%Duryodhana%} (V, {@18@}). {%Yuyudhāna,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) came to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with troops (description). For the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} there were thus assembled seven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} of
<div n="lb">troops from various directions. In the same way king
<div n="lb">{%Bhagadatta%} (with an {%akṣauhiṇī%} crowded with {%Cīnas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kirātas%}), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) came to the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras.%} And thus
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} had a force which numbered eleven {%akṣauhiṇīs,%}
<div n="lb">so that there was no room for them in the city of {%Hāstinapura;%}
<div n="lb">but the {%Pañcanada,%} the whole {%Kurujāṅgala,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), full of
<div n="lb">ābundant corn and wealth, was entirely overspread with the
<div n="lb">army of the {%Kauravas.%} And this army was beheld by
<div n="lb">the {%purohita%} who had been sent by the {%Pāñcāla%} king to the
<div n="lb">{%Kurus%} (V, {@19@}).
