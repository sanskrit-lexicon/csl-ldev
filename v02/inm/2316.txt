{@Śakuntalopākhyāna(ṃ)@},¦ “episode relating to Śakun-
talā.” § 133 (Sambhav.): I, {@68—70@}: {%Duṣyanta%} (q.v.) saw
{%Śakuntalā%} (§ 134), daughter of {%Viśvāmitra%} (q.v.) and {%Menakā%}.—
§ 135: Enumeration of the eight forms of marriage according
to {%Manu. Duṣyanta%}, during the absence of {%Kaṇva%}, wedded
{%Śakuntalā%} according to the {%Gāndharva%} form, promising her
that her son should be the heir apparent, and departing told
her that he should send troops to take her to his capital.
{%Kaṇva%}, by his spiritual knowledge, knew what she had done,
and approved of it, and bestowed on her the boon that the
{%Paurava%} monarchs might ever be virtuous and never be
[Page186-b+ 63]
deprived of their thrones (I, {@73@}). {%Śakuntalā%}, after three
years, brought forth a beautiful boy, for whom {%Kaṇva%} caused
all the religious rites to be performed, and who, when he
was only 6 years of age, used to seize and bind to the trees
lions, etc., wherefore he was called {%Sarvadamana%}. Then
{%Kaṇva%} caused his disciples to bring {%Śakuntalā%} and the boy to
{%Hāstinapura%} and introduce them to {%Duṣyanta%}. Then they
returned to the hermitage. {%Duṣyanta%} feigned not to remember
anything. Then {%Śakuntalā%} became angry (“But knowest
thou not the Ancient Wise [{%muniṃ purāṇaṃ%}, i.e. Nārāyaṇa]
who lies in the heart? He who sins is observed by the gods
and by him also who occupies every heart. The sun, the
moon, the air, fire, earth, sky, water, the heart, {%Yama%}, the
day, the night, both twilights, and {%Dharma%}, all witness the
acts of man. {%Yama Vaivasvata%} takes no account of the sins
of that person with whom [Nārāyaṇa] the witness of all acts
is gratified. But that person with whom he [Nārāyaṇa] is
not gratified is tortured for his sins by {%Yama…%} The
son that is born to persons cognizant of the {%Vedic mantras%}
rescues the spirits of deceased ancestors. Because the son
rescues the father from the hell which is called {%Put%}, therefore
he has been called {%puttra%} by {%Svayambhū%} himself…
Even {%ṛṣis%} cannot create creatures without women…
‘He shall perform a hundred horse sacrifices,’ were the words
uttered in the skies when I was in the lying-in room…
{%Urvaśī, Pūrvacitti, Sahajanyā, Menakā, Viśvācī%}, and {%Ghṛtācī%},
these are the six foremost {%Apsarases%}; amongst them, again,
{%Menakā%}, born of {%Brahmán%}, is the first…I can repair
to the abodes of {%Indra, Kubera, Yama%}, and {%Varuṇa…%}
The {%Pitṛs%} have said that the son continues the race, and he is
therefore the best of all religious acquirements…{%Manu%}
has said that there are five kinds of sons…”). Then
she left his presence. But a voice from the sky commanded
{%Duṣyanta%} to cherish ({%bhara%}) his son, who should therefore be
called {%Bharata%}. It was this voice of the {%Devadūta%} that
{%Duṣyanta%} had waited for, that the people should not regard
his son as of impure birth. {%Bharata%} reduced to subjection all
the kings of the earth and became a {%sārvabhauma-cakravartin%},
and performed many sacrifices with {%Kaṇva%} as the chief priest.
From him has come the {%Bharata%} race, of whom the principal
ones shall be mentioned (I, {@74@}).
