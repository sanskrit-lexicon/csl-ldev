{@Śukotpatti(ḥ)@}¦ (“origin of Śuka”). § 712 (Mokṣadh.):
<div n="lb">XII, {@324—325@} (12158—12214). Questioned by Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">about {%Śuka,%} whose mind became bent on Bráhman when
<div n="lb">he was a mere boy, Bhīṣma answered: The Ṛ. did not make
<div n="lb">merit depend upon age, etc., but upon the study of the
<div n="lb">Vedas and upon tapas; the merit of 1,000 horse-sacrifices or
<div n="lb">100 {%vājapeyas%} cannot come up to even (1/16) of the merit that
<div n="lb">arises from {%yoga.%} Once on the summit of {%Meru, Mahādeva%}
<div n="lb">sported with his followers and {%Pārvatī,%} while {%Vyāsa,%} devoted
<div n="lb">to yoga and dhāraṇā, practised austerities for 100 years for
<div n="lb">the sake of obtaining a son, subsisting on air alone, adoring
<div n="lb">{%Mahādeva.%} Thither went Ṛ., B.-ṛ., Lp., S., V., Ā., R., {%Sūrya,%}
<div n="lb">{%Candramas, Indra,%} M., the {%Oceans,%} the {%Rivers,%} A., D., G.,
<div n="lb">{%Nārada, Parvata, Viśvāvasu,%} Si., and Aps. This has been told
<div n="lb">to me by {%Mārkaṇḍeya. Śiva%} granted him that he would
<div n="lb">have a son like to {%Fire, Wind, Earth, Water,%} and {%Space,%} and
<div n="lb">devoted to {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@324@}). {%Vyāsa%} was one day
<div n="lb">employed in rubbing his sticks to make a fire, when he
<div n="lb">beheld the Aps. {%Ghṛtācī,%} and fell in love with her. When
[Page220-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">she approached, transformed into a she-parrot, he dropped
<div n="lb">his seed, which became a son, who, from this circumstance,
<div n="lb">came to be called by the name of {%Śuka. Gaṅgā%} came and
<div n="lb">bathed him in her waters; G. sung, and Aps. danced, etc.
<div n="lb">{%Viśvāvasu, Tumburu, Nā., Hāhā,%} and {%Hūhū%} eulogized the
<div n="lb">birth of {%Śuka;%} there came Lp. with {%Śakra,%} D., D.-ṛ., and B.-ṛ.;
<div n="lb">{%Māruta%} showered celestial flowers; {%Śiva,%} together with {%Pārvatī,%}
<div n="lb">invested {%Śuka%} with the sacred thread; {%Śakra%} gave him a
<div n="lb">celestial {%kamaṇḍalu%} and celestial robes, etc. As soon as {%Śuka%}
<div n="lb">was born, the Vedas, including the mysteries and abstracts
<div n="lb">{%(sarahasyāḥ sasaṅgrahāḥ),%} came to dwell in him, just as they
<div n="lb">dwelt in his father. {%Śuka%} selected {%Bṛhaspati%} for his pre-
<div n="lb">ceptor, remembering the universal practice. Having studied
<div n="lb">the Vedas, the tradition {%(itihāsaṃ),%} and the state policy
<div n="lb">{%(rājaśāstrāṇi), Śuka%} returned home, after paying his pre-
<div n="lb">ceptor the tuition fee. Adopting the vow of a brahmacārin
<div n="lb">he practised the hardest penances, even in his childhood.
<div n="lb">Taking no pleasure in the three modes of life (the domestic,
<div n="lb">etc.), he only kept in view the law of emancipation
<div n="lb">{%(mokṣadharmānudarśinaḥ)%} (XII, {@325@}). (For continuation
<div n="lb">v. {%Śukakṛti.%})
