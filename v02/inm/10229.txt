[{@Sukanyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Sukanyā”). § 405 (Tīrthay.). {%Lomaśa%} related: When
<div n="lb">{%Cyavana,%} the son of the {%maharṣi Bhṛgu%} practised austerities
<div n="lb">by the side of this lake, and, assuming the posture {%vīrasthāna,%}
<div n="lb">had been enveloped by an anthill, king {%Śaryāti%} came to the
<div n="lb">lake with his 4,000 wives and his only daughter {%Sukanyā.%}
<div n="lb">The {%viprarṣi Cyavana,%} seeing {%Sukanyā,%} was gladdened and
<div n="lb">spoke to her, but she did not hear him. Then {%Sukanyā,%}
<div n="lb">seeing his eyes in the anthill, pierced them with thorns from
<div n="lb">curiosity. He, becoming very angry, obstructed the excre-
<div n="lb">ments and urine of {%Śaryāti's%} soldiers, and {%Śaryāti%} at last
<div n="lb">discovered the cause of their distress, and only obtained
<div n="lb">deliverance therefrom by bestowing {%Sukanyā%} upon {%Cyavana.%}
<div n="lb">Then {%Śaryāti,%} with his troops, went to his city, and {%Sukanyā%}
<div n="lb">remained with {%Cyavana%} (III, {@122@}). Once, when the {%Aśvins%}
<div n="lb">had seen {%Sukanyā,%} after she had bathed, they asked her to
<div n="lb">choose one of them for her husband, and as she refused, they
<div n="lb">entered the water together with {%Cyavana,%} and when they all
<div n="lb">came out of the tank young and beautiful they asked her
<div n="lb">to choose one of them and she choose {%Cyavana. Cyavana%}
[Page656-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">promised them to make them drinkers of {%soma%} in the presence
<div n="lb">of {%Indra.%} Then the {%Aśvins,%} highly delighted, ascended to
<div n="lb">heaven (III, {@123@}). When {%Śaryāti%} heard that {%Cyavana%} had
<div n="lb">been turned into a youth, he came with his wife and troops
<div n="lb">to see him, and became very glad. {%Cyavana%} caused him to
<div n="lb">perform a sacrifice with {%Cyavana%} as his priest. When
<div n="lb">{%Cyavana%} was about to take up {%soma%} in order to offer it to the
<div n="lb">{%Aśvins, Indra%} forbade it, saying, that they were physicians
<div n="lb">and servants, assumed forms at pleasure, and roamed about
<div n="lb">in the world of mortals, and as {%Cyavana%} did not obey he
<div n="lb">prepared to hurl his thunderbolt at him, but {%Cyavana%} paralysed
<div n="lb">his arm and fulfilled his intention. Then he created a {%kṛtyā,%}
<div n="lb">a great {%Asura%} named {%Mada%} (description); this rushed forth
<div n="lb">to devour {%Indra%} (III, {@124@}), who only was delivered when
<div n="lb">he had sanctioned that the {%Aśvins%} should henceforth be
<div n="lb">entitled to the {%soma%} juice, saying that he had only intended
<div n="lb">to spread the fame of {%Cyavana%} and {%Śaryāti. Cyavana%} dis-
<div n="lb">tributed {%Mada%} (who had been created repeatedly before) in
<div n="lb">drinks, women, gambling, and hunting.
