[{@Droṇavadhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section including the
<div n="lb">slaughter of Droṇa,” the 77th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
<div n="lb">cf. Droṇavadha). § 601: CONTINUATION OF THE NIGHT AFTER
<div n="lb">THE FOURTEENTH DAY: According to the words of {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} refrained from himself seeking to slay {%Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">but was filled with grief and anger because {%Karṇa%} had slain
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkaca.%} Beholding the {%Kurus%} held in check by {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">he told {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), to attack {%Droṇa,%} who received
<div n="lb">them; {%Duryodhana,%} etc., came to {%Droṇa's%} rescue; a fierce
<div n="lb">battle ensued between the two hosts; both armies became
<div n="lb">sorely afflicted with fatigue and blind with sleep. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">granted permission to the warriors to sleep. D., Ṛ., and the
<div n="lb">soldiers applauded {%Arjuna;%} the {%Kurus%} asked {%Karṇa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} to abstain from the fight; all the combatants
<div n="lb">laid themselves down on the field to sleep (description); the
<div n="lb">{%Kaurava%} troops blessed {%Arjuna%} for his act of kindness. When
<div n="lb">the moon rose, both hosts, rising from sleep, again prepared
<div n="lb">for battle (VII, {@184@}). {%Duryodhana%} taxed {%Droṇa%} wrathfully
<div n="lb">for his kindness to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Droṇa%} in wrath promised
<div n="lb">to slay all the {%Pāñcālas,%} and described the measure of {%Arjuna's%}
<div n="lb">might and prowess (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Duryodhana%} vowed that he, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">that very day would slay {%Arjuna,%} dividing the {%Bharata%} host into
<div n="lb">two divisions. {%Droṇa%} ridiculed {%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), saying that
<div n="lb">it was only right that {%Duryodhana%} or {%Śakuni,%} who were the
<div n="lb">root of the hostility, should proceed against {%Arjuna,%} instead
<div n="lb">of causing all the unoffending {%Kṣatriyas%} to be slain, and
<div n="lb">that he should accomplish his boasting vow before {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra,%} and that he and {%Karṇa%} and {%Duḥśāsana%} would slay the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas;%} moreover, he had done all in life that one should
<div n="lb">do. The army then was divided into two bodies, and the
<div n="lb">battle commenced (VII, {@185@}).—§ 602: THE FIFTEENTH
<div n="lb">DAY: When three-quarters of that night had worn away,
<div n="lb">the battle once more commenced. At sunrise both hosts,
<div n="lb">alighting from their chariots, etc., uttered the prayers of the
<div n="lb">twilight. After the {%Kuru%} army had been divided into two
<div n="lb">bodies, {%Droṇa,%} with {%Duryodhana%} before him, proceeded against
<div n="lb">the {%Somakas,%} the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and the {%Pāñcālas.%} Urged by
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna%} moved to the left of {%Droṇa%} and {%Karṇa.%}
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} urged {%Arjuna%} to put forth all his vigour. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">{%& Droṇa & Karṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (description). {%Droṇa%} moved away
<div n="lb">towards the north; the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops began to tremble;
<div n="lb">the {%Pāñcālas & Droṇa; Drupada%} and {%Virāṭa%} + the three
<div n="lb">grandsons of {%Drupada%} + the {%Cedis & Droṇa,%} who slew the
<div n="lb">three grandsons of {%Drupada,%} vanquished the {%Cedis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">and slew {%Drupada%} and {%Virāṭa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} swore to slay
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} that very day; {%Drupada%} with his division (from one
<div n="lb">side) + {%Arjuna%} (from another side) & {%Droṇa + Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhaṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Bhīma%} urged {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} and they both
<div n="lb">attacked {%Droṇa's%} division (description); soon the morning sun
<div n="lb">arose (VII, {@186@}). The warriors adored the Sun, as he
<div n="lb">rose, and the battle once more commenced (description);
<div n="lb">neither {%Karṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), could be seen for dust. {%Duryodhana,%}
[Page269-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), engaged in battle with four of the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors:
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} + his brothers & {%Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva; Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%& Bhīma; Droṇa & Arjuna; Nakula%} was worsted by {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} (VII, {@187@}); {%Sahadeva%} slew {%Duḥśāsana's%} driver;
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana%} was worsted by {%Sahadeva; Bhīma%} jumped into the
<div n="lb">chariot of {%Nakula; Droṇa%} invoked the {%Aindra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">weapons; D., G., Ṛ., Si., Aps., Y., and Rā. applauded {%Droṇa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} saying that “this is no human, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), but a high
<div n="lb">{%Brāhma%} encounter”; both employed the {%Brāhma%} weapon;
<div n="lb">the engagement became general (VII, {@188@}). {%Duḥśāsana &%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} who vanquished him and proceeded against
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa. Kṛtavarman%} + three of his brothers & {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna + Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva,%} who checked them
<div n="lb">(enumeration of unfair weapons that were not used);
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} proceeded towards {%Droṇa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna +%}
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki & Droṇa + Duryodhana%} (who grieved on account of his
<div n="lb">former friendship with {%Sātyaki%}); {%Duryodhana%} was worsted by
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki; Karṇa%} rushed to the rescue of {%Duryodhana; Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">rushed towards {%Karṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged his warriors to
<div n="lb">rush to the rescue of {%Sātyaki, Bhīma,%} and the twins; {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">attacked the {%Kurus,%} and {%Droṇa%} attacked the {%Pāñcālas%} (VII,
<div n="lb">{@189@}). {%Droṇa%} caused a great carnage among the {%Pāñcālas;%}
<div n="lb">the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Sṛñjayas & Droṇa;%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} feared,
<div n="lb">thinking that {%Arjuna%} would not fight with {%Droṇa. Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">told {%Arjuna%} to abandon virtue and let some man tell {%Droṇa%}
<div n="lb">that {%Aśvatthāman%} had been slain in battle. {%Arjuna%} did not
<div n="lb">approve of it; others approved of it, but {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with
<div n="lb">great difficulty. {%Bhīma%} slew with a mace an elephant named
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} belonging to the {%Mālava%} chief {%Indravarman,%}
<div n="lb">and exclaimed before {%Droṇa:%} “{%Aśvatthāman%} has been slain.”
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} did not believe {%Bhīma,%} but attacked {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
<div n="lb">and slew the {%Pāñcālas%} (and {%Somakas%}) with the {%Brāhma%}
<div n="lb">weapon, and cut off the head of {%Vasudāna,%} and slew 500
<div n="lb">{%Matsyas,%} etc. The Ṛ. {%Viśvāmitra,%} etc., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), appeared in
<div n="lb">the welkin and reproved {%Droṇa%} for using the {%Brāhma%} weapon
<div n="lb">against persons not acquainted with it, and called upon
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} to lay aside his weapons and leave the earth soon.
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} whether the report about {%Aśvatthā-%}
<div n="lb">{%man's%} death was true; {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Yudhiṣṭhra%} to save his
<div n="lb">army by an untruth; {%Bhīma%} urged him to do the same;
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} distinctly said that {%Aśvatthāman%} was dead,
<div n="lb">adding indistinctly the word “elephant”; before this {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira's%} chariot had stayed at a height of four fingers' breadth
<div n="lb">from the surface of the earth; after this untruth his animals
<div n="lb">touched the earth. {%Droṇa%} became quite dejected, also
<div n="lb">after the words of the Ṛ., and beholding {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
<div n="lb">before him, could not fight as before (VII, {@190@}). {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna & Droṇa;%} the celestial weapons no longer appeared
<div n="lb">at {%Droṇa's%} bidding; his weapons, that had not been exhausted
<div n="lb">for four days and one night, now became exhausted on the
<div n="lb">third part of the fifth day. {%Droṇa%} took up another celestial
<div n="lb">bow which {%Aṅgiras%} had given him; a fierce encounter took
<div n="lb">place between {%Droṇa%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna;%} none else had
<div n="lb">arrows of that kind that {%Droṇa%} used in close fight except
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Sātyaki%} rescued {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and was
<div n="lb">applauded by {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna,%} and the Si., etc. (VII,
<div n="lb">{@191@}). {%Duryodhana, Karṇa,%} and {%Kṛpa + Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons
<div n="lb">{%& Sātyaki + Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged his
<div n="lb">troops against {%Droṇa%} (in order to aid {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}), who
<div n="lb">again used the {%Brāhma%} weapon; {%Bhīma%} took up {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
<div n="lb">on his own chariot, and urged him to slay {%Droṇa%} quickly;
<div n="lb">both {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Droṇa%} invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon,
<div n="lb">etc.: {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} began to slay the {%Vaśātis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Bhīma%}
[Page269-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">again reminded {%Droṇa%} of {%Aśvatthāman's%} death, calling upon
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa, Kṛpa,%} and {%Duryodhana%} to exert carefully in battle.
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} laid his weapons aside, devoted himself to {%yoga,%} and
<div n="lb">proceeded to heaven {%(Brahmaloka)%} in the company of the
<div n="lb">foremost of Ṛ., in a blaze of light, that only {%Sañjaya,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), saw; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} cut off {%Droṇa's%} head—though for-
<div n="lb">bidden by {%Arjuna%} and blamed by everybody—and threw it
<div n="lb">down amongst the {%Kurus,%} who ran away in all directions,
<div n="lb">except {%Aśvatthāman. Sañjaya,%} through the grace of {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">beheld {%Droṇa's%} proceeding after he had ascended the sky.
<div n="lb">The {%Kurus,%} the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and the {%Sṛñjayas%} all became
<div n="lb">dejected and ran away; {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
<div n="lb">embraced each other, {%Bhīmasena%} expecting the slaughter of
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} and {%Duryodhana%} (VII, {@192@}).
