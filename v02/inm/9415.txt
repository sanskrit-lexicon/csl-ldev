[{@Saṃvar(t)ta-Maruttīya@}]¦ (“the tale of Saṃvartta
and Marutta”): § 778{%b%} (Aśvamedh.).** {%Vyāsa%} said: In the
{%Kṛta%} age {%Manu%} was the ruler; > {%Prasandhi > Kṣupa%}
{%> Ikṣvāku > Viṃśa%} (the model bowman, the eldest of 100
brothers, all kings) {%> Viviṃśa > Khanīnetra (c) > Suvarcas (d%})
{%Karandhama > Avikṣit (e) Kārandhama > Marutta%} (who sur-
passed his father, had the strength of 10,000 elephants, and
was equal to {%Viṣṇu%}). Desirous of performing a sacrifice,
{%Marutta%}, coming to {%Meru%}, on the northern side of {%Himavat%},
caused thousands of gold vessels to be forged; there on a huge
golden hill he performed the rites along with other princes
(XIV, {@4@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} said: As the
offspring of {%Prajāpati Dakṣa%}, D. and As., challenged each
other, so did {%Aṅgiras'%} sons {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Saṃvarta%}; troubled
by his elder brother {%Saṃvarta%} went naked to the woods.
{%Indra%}, having vanquished the As., appointed Bṛh. as his
priest. Formerly (read {%pūrvaṃ%} with B.) {%Aṅgiras%} was the
family priest of king {%Karandhama%} (see {%d%}); so also of his son
{%Avikṣit%} (equal to {%Yayāti%}). His son {%Marutta%} used to defy
{%Indra%}, and {%Indra%} used to defy {%Marutta%}, but could not prevail
over him. Then {%Indra%} took the promise from Bṛh. that he
would not perform priestly offices for {%Marutta%} (“thou hast
destroyed {%Namuci, Viśvarūpa%}, and {%Bala%},” said Bṛh.).
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Then {%Indra%} was cured for his envy
and went home (XIV, {@5@}). {%Vyāsa%} said: The ancient tale
of the discourse between Bṛh. and {%Marutta%} is cited in this
connection. {%Marutta%} in vain tried to persuade Bṛh. to
officiate at his sacrifice (which Bṛh. had himself formerly
proposed); D. ṛ. (M.-ṛ.) {%Nārada%} told him to apply to {%Saṃvarta%},
who now, desirous of seeing {%Maheśvara%}, wandered about in
{%Vārāṇasī%} in the garb of a madman; “having reached the
gate of that city, thou must place a dead body somewhere
near it, and the man who shall turn away on seeing the
corpse, do thou know that man to be {%Saṃvarta%}; if he should
ask thee to follow me,” said {%Nārada%}, “thou mayst even tell
him without hesitation that I have ascended the pyre.”
{%Vyāsa%} said: “By acting thus, {%Marutta%} found {%Saṃvarta%}
in a lonely place; {%Saṃvarta%} covered him with mud and
ashes and phlegm and spittle. At last he sat down under
a {%nyagrodha%} tree” (XIV, {@6@}). {%Marutta%} told him the matter
(also that {%Nārada%} had mounted the pyre); {%Saṃvarta%} then,
as a lunatic, scolding {%Marutta%} repeatedly with harsh words,
told him to go to Bṛh. first (as his elder brother), and taking
Bṛh.'s permission he might come back. As {%Marutta%} said
that he had already been repulsed by Bṛh., and that he now
desired to sacrifice even with all his goods in order to outstrip
{%Indra, Saṃvarta%} consented, if {%Marutta%} would agree to do all
that {%Saṃvarta%} would ask him to do, as Bṛh. and {%Indra%} were
certain to do all they could to injure {%Marutta. Marutta%} took
an oath to this. {%Saṃvarta%} said that {%Marutta%} would surpass
[Page614-b+ 63]
{%Indra%}, D., and G.; he himself had no desire for wealth, but
would only do what was disagreeable to {%Indra%} and Bṛh.
(XIV, {@7@}). {%Saṃvarta%} said: There is a peak {%Muñjavat (f%}) on
the {%Himālaya%}, where {%Śiva%} is constantly engaged in austerities;
go thither and appease {%Śiva%}, whose names are {%Śarva%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>);
then thou shalt acquire that gold. {%Marutta%} acted accordingly;
Bṛh. became sick from envy; {%Indra%} with D. came (XIV, {@8@})
and was told about the matter (“prosperity of a rival is always
painful, and for this reason thou with D. persecutest As. and
kills them”). He despatched {%Agni (g%}) to {%Marutta%}, asking
him to let Bṛh. officiate as his priest instead of {%Saṃvarta%},
promising him the greatest rewards (“such as the highest
regions created by {%Prajāpati%} and even the whole kingdom of
the gods”); {%Saṃvarta%} threatened to burn {%Agni%} with his
fearful eye, if he ever came again on such an errand. {%Agni%}
was frightened and returned to {%Indra%} and Bṛh. and said that
{%Marutta%} had refused and did not care for his promises. {%Indra%}
asked {%Agni%} to return to {%Marutta%}, and threatened him with
{%Indra's%} thunderbolt if he did not obey; {%Agni%}, afraid of
{%Saṃvarta%}, suggested that the G. king should go; {%Indra%} said
that nobody could burn {%Agni; Agni%} asked why then {%Vṛtra%}
could deprive {%Indra%} of the sovereignty of Heaven; {%Indra%},
mentioning his victories over the {%Kālakeyas%}, Dā., and
{%Prahlāda%}, said that it was because he did not accept {%soma%}
from a foe, nor strike the weak with his thunderbolt; {%Agni%}
reminded him of {%Cyavana%} at {%Śaryāti's%} sacrifice and the
creation of {%Mada%} (description): “the might of brahmans
is greater than that of kṣatriyas” (XIV, {@9@}). Then {%Indra%}
sent G. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} on the same errand, but in vain. {%Vyāsa%}
said: As the clouds indicated that {%Indra%} must be near,
{%Marutta%} repaired to {%Saṃvarta%}, who comforted him, saying that
{%Agni%} would protect him, and that he would himself dispel
the thunder by the winds, and granted him the boon that {%Indra%}
should come in person to his sacrifice and accept the oblations
offered to him, and so should all the gods. And so it
happened by the power of {%Saṃvarta's%} incantations. Re-
quested by {%Saṃvarta, Indra%} himself gave directions to all the
gods to erect a hall of assembly: 1,000 well-furnished
rooms with a durable staircase for the ascent of G. and Aps.,
and to furnish that portion of the sacrificial ground reserved
for the dance of Aps., like unto the palace of {%Indra%} in
heaven; {%Indra%} said that {%Marutta's%} ancestors and the gods
had been highly pleased, and told him to offer a red bull to
{%Agni%}, and a blue bull with a variegated skin to V.-D.
Then {%Indra%} and the gods returned home. {%Marutta%} placed
heaps of gold on various spots and distributed immense
wealth to the brahmans.
