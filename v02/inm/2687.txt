{@Śrāddhaparvan@}¦ ({%°va%}), “the section relating to the
Śrāddha,” the 87th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr. § 10
(Parvas.): I, {@2@}, 349.—§ 620: {%Kṛṣṇa%} censured {%Gāndhārī%},
saying that this vast carnage had taken place by her fault,
through her son {%Duryodhana%}; and told her not to grieve
(“the cow brings forth offspring to bear burthens…
the {%Śūdrā%} woman to increase the number of servitors…
a princess, like thee, brings forth sons to be slaughtered”).
{%Gāndhārī%} remained silent. Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that one billion 660,020,000 men had
fallen; and 24,165 had escaped; the fallen had all attained to
regions like those of {%Indra%} (specifying those who had attained
to G., Gh., {%Brahmaloka%}, and {%Uttarakurus%}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
said that in the forest he had obtained the gift of
spiritual vision from D.-ṛ. {%Lomaśa%}. Urged by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ordered {%Sudharman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), to cause the funeral
rites of the slain (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) to be duly performed; they burned
them upon funeral pyres; the {%Pitṛmedha%}-rites were performed
for some of the illustrious dead; by the noise of {%sāmans%},
{%ṛcs%}, and lamentations all creatures became stupefied that
night. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} proceeded towards
the {%Gaṅgā%} (XI, {@26@}). The {%Kuru%} ladies, etc., performed the
water-rites for their fellow-kinsmen at the {%Gaṅgā. Kuntī%}, in
a paroxysm of grief, disclosed the truth about {%Karṇa's%} birth
(<lang n="greek">γ</lang>) to her sons. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} grieved, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
lamented, hearing that {%Karṇa%} was his elder brother (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused {%Karṇa's%} wives, etc., to be brought
before him, and with them performed the water-rite in
honour of {%Karṇa%} (XI, {@27@}).
