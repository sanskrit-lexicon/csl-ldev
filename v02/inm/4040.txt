[{@Gaṅgāvataraṇa(ṃ)@}]¦ (“descent of the Gaṅgā”). § 389
<div n="lb">(Sagara): Asked by {%Sagara%} to bring back the horse and
<div n="lb">deliver him from hell {%(Narakād), Aṃśumat%} went to the spot
<div n="lb">where the earth had been excavated, entered the sea by that
<div n="lb">very way, and beheld {%Kapila%} and the horse. As he bowed
<div n="lb">his head before {%Kapila,%} etc., {%Kapila%} granted him the horse,
<div n="lb">and that his fathers should be purified and go to heaven,
<div n="lb">when his son's son, by the favour of {%Śiva,%} brought {%Tripathagā%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Gaṅgā) from heaven. When he had brought the horse
<div n="lb">back to the sacrificial yard and narrated all the events to
<div n="lb">{%Sagara, Sagara%} grieved no more, but praised {%Aṃśumat%} and
<div n="lb">finished the sacrificial rites. {%Sagara%} was greeted by all the
<div n="lb">gods and converted the sea into a son of himself {%(putratve%}
<div n="lb">{%kalpayām āsa),%} and after a long reign placed his grandson on
<div n="lb">the throne and ascended to heaven. {%Aṃśumat%} ruled the
<div n="lb">whole earth like {%Sagara,%} and died after he had placed his son
[Page299-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Dilīpa%} on the throne. {%Dilīpa%} in vain tried to effect the
<div n="lb">descent of {%Gaṅgā%} in order to raise his forefathers. He then
<div n="lb">anointed his son {%Bhagīratha%} as king, and practised austerities
<div n="lb">in the forest, and then ascended to heaven (III, {@107@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhagīratha%} made over his kingly duties to his minister
<div n="lb">{%(sacive),%} and {%(b)%} practised austerities on the {%Himavat%} during
<div n="lb">1000 celestial years, living upon fruits, roots, and water.
<div n="lb">Then {%Gaṅgā Haimavatī%} appeared in a material form
<div n="lb">{%(mūrtimatī),%} and promised to besprinkle the bodies of his
<div n="lb">forefathers and carry them to heaven, and as there existed
<div n="lb">none in the three worlds except {%Śiva,%} who was able to sustain
<div n="lb">her fall, she caused {%Bhagīratha%} to go to {%Kailāsa,%} where he, by
<div n="lb">his austerities, obtained the favour of {%Śiva%} (III, {@108@}), who,
<div n="lb">surrounded by his awful attendants {%(pāriṣadaiḥ),%} came to
<div n="lb">{%Himavat.%} There he caused {%Bhagīratha%} to pray to {%Gaṅgā.%}
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā%} immediately came down from the sky, in the presence
<div n="lb">of the gods, {%maharṣis, Gandharvas, snakes,%} and {%Yakṣas,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Śiva%} received her on his forehead, whence she fell to the
<div n="lb">earth, divided into three streams. At her request {%Bhagīratha%}
<div n="lb">led her to the spot where the bodies of {%Sagara's%} sons lay,
<div n="lb">while {%Śiva%} went to {%Kailāsa%} with the celestials. {%Gaṅgā%} filled
<div n="lb">the sea, and {%Bhagīratha%} adopted her as his daughter and
<div n="lb">offered libations of water to his forefathers (III, {@109@}).
