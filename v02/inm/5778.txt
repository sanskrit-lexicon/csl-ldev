{@Kirmīravadhaparvan(°va)@}¦ (“the section relating to
<div n="lb">the killing of Kirmīra,” the 31st of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.; cf. Kirmīravadha). § 316: {%Vidura%} had heard it from
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and now related it to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} Departing
<div n="lb">from {%Hāstinapura%} and travelling for three days and nights
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} reached the {%Kāmyaka%} wood. At midnight
<div n="lb">a man-eating {%rākṣasa, Kirmīra,%} brother of {%Baka%} and friend
<div n="lb">of {%Hiḍimba,%} obstructed their path with a lighted brand, and
<div n="lb">would avenge himself on {%Bhīma. Kṛṣṇā%} was afraid.
<div n="lb">{%Dhaumya%} destroyed his illusion by {%rākṣasa%}-destroying
[Page409-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%mantras. Arjuna%} stringed his bow {%Gāṇḍīva;%} but {%Bhīma,%} making
<div n="lb">him desist, fought with trees, etc., against {%Kirmīra,%} as the
<div n="lb">brothers {%Vāli%} and {%Sugrīva%} had done of yore for the sake of the
<div n="lb">same woman. At last {%Bhīma%} seized him with his arms and
<div n="lb">whirled him about and killed him. Then placing {%Kṛṣṇā%} in their
<div n="lb">front they set out for {%Dvaitavana.%} Having cleared the forest
<div n="lb">of its pest they began to live there. “Passing through the
<div n="lb">forest, I saw the body of the {%rākṣasa,%} and heard the story
<div n="lb">from the brahmans” (III, {@11@}).
