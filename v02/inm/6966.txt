[{@Maitreya-bhikṣā@}]¦ (“the alms of Maitreya”). § 763{%b%}
(Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: Once {%Vyāsa%}, while wandering
in disguise, waited at {%Vārāṇasī%} upon {%Maitreya%} in the house
of a loose woman ({%svairiṇīkule%}; so BR.; quite otherwise
Nīl. and PCR.), and was fed by him with excellent food. As
he smiled, {%Maitreya%} said that he did not see much difference
between one that behaved as an ordinary person [such as
Vyāsa] [and himself], [or generally] between one who is
unemancipated and one who is emancipated, especially when
[the latter, such as Maitreya] was distinguished by birth
({%pṛthag ācaratas tāta pṛthagātmasukhātmanoḥ|alpāntaram ahaṃ%}
{%manye, viśiṣṭam api cānvayāt%}; cf. Nīl. and PCR.). {%Vyāsa%}
said that he wondered that the {%Vedas%} should [seemingly]
contain an untruth; for even a small gift (as, for instance,
a little water given to a thirsty man) produces great results,
and {%Maitreya%} had, by feeding {%Vyāsa%}, conquered many high
regions of felicity, as one does [according to the {%Vedas%}, only]
by great sacrifices. Gift is more auspicious than all sacred
acts (XIII, {@120@}). {%Maitreya%}, approving of the words of
{%Vyāsa%}, praised the brahmans as the root of righteousness:
“if the brahman be gratified, D. and P. also are gratified,”
referring to Ṛ. (XIII, {@121@}). {%Vyāsa%}, saying that even the
most atrocious sins are washed off by (gifts and) penances,
recommended to him the duties of householders (XIII, {@123@}).
