[{@Maitreya-bhikṣā@}]¦ (“the alms of Maitreya”). § 763{%b%}
<div n="lb">(Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: Once {%Vyāsa,%} while wandering
<div n="lb">in disguise, waited at {%Vārāṇasī%} upon {%Maitreya%} in the house
<div n="lb">of a loose woman ({%svairiṇīkule;%} so BR.; quite otherwise
<div n="lb">Nīl. and PCR.), and was fed by him with excellent food. As
<div n="lb">he smiled, {%Maitreya%} said that he did not see much difference
<div n="lb">between one that behaved as an ordinary person [such as
<div n="lb">Vyāsa] [and himself], [or generally] between one who is
<div n="lb">unemancipated and one who is emancipated, especially when
<div n="lb">[the latter, such as Maitreya] was distinguished by birth
<div n="lb">({%pṛthag ācaratas tāta pṛthagātmasukhātmanoḥ|alpāntaram ahaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%manye, viśiṣṭam api cānvayāt;%} cf. Nīl. and PCR.). {%Vyāsa%}
<div n="lb">said that he wondered that the {%Vedas%} should [seemingly]
<div n="lb">contain an untruth; for even a small gift (as, for instance,
<div n="lb">a little water given to a thirsty man) produces great results,
<div n="lb">and {%Maitreya%} had, by feeding {%Vyāsa,%} conquered many high
<div n="lb">regions of felicity, as one does [according to the {%Vedas,%} only]
<div n="lb">by great sacrifices. Gift is more auspicious than all sacred
<div n="lb">acts (XIII, {@120@}). {%Maitreya,%} approving of the words of
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa,%} praised the brahmans as the root of righteousness:
<div n="lb">“if the brahman be gratified, D. and P. also are gratified,”
<div n="lb">referring to Ṛ. (XIII, {@121@}). {%Vyāsa,%} saying that even the
<div n="lb">most atrocious sins are washed off by (gifts and) penances,
<div n="lb">recommended to him the duties of householders (XIII, {@123@}).
