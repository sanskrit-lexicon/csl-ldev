[{@Pāṇḍavotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the birth of the Pāṇḍavas”).
§ 190: When {%Gāndhārī%} had been with child a full year
{%Kuntī%} invoked {%Dharma%}, who came seated on his chariot.
She brought forth {%Yudhiṣṭhira (b%}). Similarly the birth of
{%Bhīmasena (c%}) and {%Arjuna (d%}) are related in full (cf. § 157)—
§ 191: Then {%Kuntī%} refused to have any more sons (I, {@123@}).
—§ 192: Birth of {%Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%} (cf. § 157); celestial
voice. The {%ṛṣis%} on {%Śataśṛṅga%} gave the sons of {%Pāṇḍu%}
names. They were born at intervals of one year from one
another. They became great favourites of the {%ṛṣis%} and
their wives, dwelling on {%Śataśrṅga%} (cf. v. 4864: {%Haimavate%}
{%girau%}). {%Kuntī%} refused to help {%Madrī%} to get more children, as
she had been deceived by her having two sons at once (I, {@124@}).
