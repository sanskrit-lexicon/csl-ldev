[{@Dhaumya-purohitakaraṇa@}]¦ (“the Pāṇḍavas' making
Dhaumya their purohita”). § 230 (Caitrarathap.): {%Arjuna%}
gave his {%Āgneya%} weapon to the {%Gandharva Citraratha%} and
said: “Let the horses you give us remain with you for some
time; when occasion comes we will take them from you.”
Then the {%Pāṇḍavas%} took leave of the {%Gandharva%}, and left
the banks of the Bhāgīrathī. At that time {%Dhaumya%}, the
younger brother of {%Devala%}, was dwelling at the {%tīrtha%} named
{%Utkocaka%}, engaged in ascetic penances. According to the
counsel of the {%Gandharva%}, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} installed {%Dhaumya%}
in the office of their {%purohita%}, and became his {%yājyas%}. Then
they resolved to go to the {%svayaṃvara%} of {%Pāñcālī%} (i.e. {%Kṛṣṇā%})
(I, {@183@}).
