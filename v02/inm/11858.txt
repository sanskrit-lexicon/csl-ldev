[{@Vicitravīryoparama(ḥ)@}]¦ (“death of Vicitravīrya”).
§ 167 (cf. Citrāṅgadopākhyāna). When {%Vicitravīrya%} had
come of age, {%Bhīṣma%} went to {%Vārāṇasī%} to the {%svayaṃvara%} of
the three daughters of the king of {%Kāśi%}, and, in order to
marry them to {%Vicitravīrya%}, he carried them off with force to
{%Hāstinapura%} (having defeated the other princes assembled,
among these king {%Śālva%}, whom he conquered by means of
the {%Vāruṇa%} and the {%Aindra%} weapons, but at last he left him
with his life to return to his capital). The eldest, {%Ambā%}, he
let free before the wedding, as she declared that she, in her
heart, had chosen the {%Saubha%} king (i.e. Śālva), and had been
chosen by him. {%Ambikā%} and {%Ambālikā%} he bestowed on
{%Vicitravīrya%}. After seven years {%Vicitravīrya%} died of con-
sumption ({%yakṣman%}) (I, {@102@}).
