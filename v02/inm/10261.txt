{@Sulabhā-Janaka-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“the conversation
<div n="lb">between Sulabhā and Janaka”). § 709{%b%} (Mokṣadh.).
<div n="lb">Bhīṣma related the old narrative of the discourse in days
<div n="lb">of yore, in {%Dharma-yuga,%} between king {%Janaka Maithila%}
<div n="lb">{%Dharmadhvaja%} (devoted to renunciation, conversant with the
<div n="lb">Veda, the {%mokṣa-śāstra,%} etc.), whom many wise men desired
<div n="lb">to imitate, and the female mendicant {%Sulabhā,%} who practised
<div n="lb">{%Yoga%} and wandered over the Earth, and had heard from many
<div n="lb">{%tridaṇḍins%} about {%Janaka.%} By her {%Yoga-%}power she assumed
<div n="lb">a beautiful form and instantly repaired to {%Mithilā,%} and, on
<div n="lb">pretence of begging alms, presented herself before the king,
<div n="lb">who was surrounded by his ministers and learned scholars.
<div n="lb">By {%Yoga%} she entered the king's consciousness by her own
<div n="lb">consciousness {%(sattvaṃ sattvena).%} Then they conversed upon
<div n="lb">emancipation. The king said he was a disciple of the
<div n="lb">{%bhikṣu Pañcaśikha%} of {%Parāśara's%} race, and fully conversant
<div n="lb">with {%Sāṅkhya%} and {%Yoga,%} etc.; {%Pañcaśikha%} had dwelt with him
<div n="lb">for four months in the rainy season. {%Sulabhā%} enumerated
<div n="lb">thirty principles. {%Sulabhā%} was the daughter of R-ṛ {%Pradhāna;%}
<div n="lb">in the sacrifices of her ancestors {%Indra%} used to come with
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); no suitable husband could be obtained for
<div n="lb">her; therefore, she wandered over the earth alone, observant
<div n="lb">of the practices of asceticism. {%Sulabhā%} dwelt this one night
<div n="lb">in his person like a mendicant in an empty house (XII, {@321@}).
