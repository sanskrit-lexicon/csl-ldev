[{@Mahābhiṣopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“episode relating to king
Mahābhiṣa”). § 161 (Sambhavap.): The {%rājarṣi Mahā-%}
{%bhiṣa%}, of the race of {%Ikṣvāku%}, had gratified {%Indra%} by 1,000
horse sacrifices and 100 {%rājasūyas%} and attained to {%Svarga%}.
One day, when the gods and {%rājarṣis%} were worshipping
{%Brahmán%}, the {%Wind%} loosened the garments of {%Gaṅgā%}. The
gods bent down their heads, but {%Mahābhiṣa%} rudely stared at
her, and for this {%Brahmán%} cursed him, saying that he should
be reborn on earth, [as should also {%Gaṅgā%}, but when his
wrath should be provoked by her he should again attain to
heaven] (the words in brackets are only to be found in B.).
He then wished to be born as a son of {%Pratīpa%}. The {%Vasus%}
had been cursed by the ṛṣi {%Vasiṣṭha%}, whom they had
crossed when he was engaged in his twilight adorations, that
they should be born among men. They chose to be born of
{%Gaṅgā%} as sons to {%Śāntanu%}, who should be borne to {%Pratīpa%},
and {%Gaṅgā%} promised that she would throw them into the water
as soon as they were born, except one, upon whom they
would each contribute one-eighth of their energies, but who
should be childless (I, {@96@}). (For continuation v. Śāntanū-
pākhyāna.)
