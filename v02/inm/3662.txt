{@[Draupadīharaṇaparvan]@}¦ (“the carrying away of
Draupadī,” the 46th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf.
Draupadīharaṇa(ṃ) parva.) § 521: While {%Duryodhana%},
{%Duḥśāsana, Karṇa%}, and {%Śakuni%} were longing to harm
the {%Pāṇḍavas, Durvāsas%} arrived with 10,000 disciples, and
harassed {%Duryodhana%} with his whimsical and insolent
behaviour; but as {%Duryodhana%} was neither angered nor
annoyed, he granted him a boon. According to what had
been agreed upon between himself and {%Karṇa%} and {%Duḥśāsana%},
{%Duryodhana%} asked {%Durvāsas%} to visit the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with his
disciples, when {%Draupadī%}, after having regaled the {%brahmans%},
etc., with food, would have gone to rest. {%Durvāsas%} promised
to do so (III, {@262@}). Then {%Durvāsas%} one day came to the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} with 10,000 disciples, when the meal was over and
{%Kṛṣṇā%} was reposing. {%Kṛṣṇā%} then praised {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who,
leaving {%Rūkmiṇī%}, who was sleeping by his side, came to her
and demanded something to eat. {%Draupadī%} became embarrassed,
because the sun-given vessel only remained full till she had
finished her meal, and therefore now was empty. At the
request of {%Kṛṣṇa%} she, however, fetched the vessel, and
{%Kṛṣṇa%} found a particle of rice and vegetable sticking at its
rim, and swallowing it he said to her: “May it please the
god who is the soul of the universe ({%viśvātmā%}), and may the
partaker of sacrifices ({%yajñabhuk%}) be satisfied.” Then he
ordered {%Bhīma%} (B. {%Sahadeva%}) to invite the {%munis%} to dinner.
Meanwhile those ascetics, having bathed in the river,
observed that their stomachs were full, and as {%Durvāsas%}
feared that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would destroy them, looking down
upon them with angry eyes, because the repast had been
uselessly prepared for them (“I am afraid,” said {%Durvāsas%},
[Page260-b+ 63]
“of men that are devoted to {%Hari%}”), they all ran away, so
that {%Bhīma%} (B. {%Sahadeva%}) sought for them in vain. As the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} were afraid that the {%munis%} might return at night
and curse them, {%Kṛṣṇa%} suddenly appeared and consoled
them. Then he repaired to his capital (III, {@263@}).—§ 522:
One day when the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had gone a-hunting, leaving
{%Draupadī%} in the hermitage with the permission of the
great {%ṛṣi Tṛṇabindu%} and of {%Dhaumya%}, the king of {%Sindhu%}
(of {%Sauvīra%}, v. 15599; of the {%Śibis, Sauvīras, Sindhus%}, etc.,
15621), {%Jayadratha Vārddhakṣattri%}, who, with a view of
matrimony, was on his way to the king of the {%Śālveyas%}, halted
in the wood of {%Kāmyaka%}, and seeing {%Draupadī%} standing at the
threshold of the hermitage, he fell in love with her, and sent
king {%Koṭikāsya%} (king {%Suratha's%} son, v. 15593; the foremost of
the Śibis, v. 15602) to inquire who she was (III, {@264@}).
{%Koṭikāsya%} introduced himself to {%Draupadī%} and showed her
the Trigarta king {%Kṣemaṅkara%}, and the son of the king of
the {%Kulindas%} (“who always lives in the mountains”), and
the son of {%Subala%} (B. {%Subhava%}) of the race of {%Ikṣvāku%}; he
said that {%Jayadratha%} was there at the head of 6,000 chariots,
etc., followed by twelve {%Sauvīra%} princes as his standard-bearers
({%Aṅgāraka%}, etc., enumerated) (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), and his brothers ({%Balāhaka%},
{%Anīka, Vidāraṇa%}, etc.) (III, {@265@}). {%Draupadī%} told {%Koṭikāsya%}
who she was, and that her husbands were out a-hunting
({%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to the east, {%Bhīma%} towards the south, {%Arjuna%}
to the west, and the {%Aśvins%} towards the north), and invited
them to alight and await the return of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (III,
{@266@}). {%Koṭikāsya%} told {%Jayadratha%} the words of {%Draupadī%},
and exhorted him to take her with him to the {%Sauvīras%}.
{%Jayadratha%} introduced himself to {%Draupadī%}, who offered
him water for washing his feet, and promised him fifty
animals for breakfast and various kinds of deer, etc., etc.
(enumerated), when {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} returned. {%Jayadratha%}
asked her to leave the miserable {%Pāṇḍavas%} and become
his wife (III, {@267@}), but was severely rebuked by {%Draupadī%},
who threatened him with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. As {%Jayadratha%}
said, “We too belong by birth to the seventeen high clans,
and look down upon the {%Pāṇḍavas%},” she threatened him
with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}, and the {%Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis%}, and
{%Kaikeyas%}, and called upon {%Dhaumya. Jayadratha%} seized her
by her upper garment; {%Draupadī%} pushed him so that he fell
upon the ground; but at last she was obliged to ascend his
chariot, while {%Dhaumya%} followed amidst {%Jayadratha's%} infantry
(III, {@268@}). When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} again met, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
knew from the shrill cries of the birds that the forest had
been invaded by hostile intruders, and he caused them to give
up the chase and drive home on their great chariots drawn
by {%Saindhava%} horses. A yellow jackal on their left indicated
the violence done. {%Indrasena%} learned what had happened
from the weeping foster-sister of {%Draupadī%}, and then they
pursued and overtook {%Jayadratha%}, who was greatly alarmed
(III, {@269@}). {%Draupadī%}, asked by {%Jayadratha%}, pointed out
to him each of the five {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and advised him to
throw down his arms and seek the protection of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
at the top of whose flagstaff two tabours called {%Nanda%}
and {%Upananda%} are constantly played. The {%Pāṇḍavas%},
leaving the panic-stricken infantry alone, rushed upon the
charioteers [so PCR., who seems to have read {%rathānīkaṃ%},
which is, to be sure, the right reading, instead of {%yathānīkaṃ%},
which occurs both in C. and B.] (III, {@270@}). {%Bhīma%} with
his iron mace ({%sarvaśaikyāyasīṃ gadāṃ%}), embossed with gold,
rushed towards {%Jayadratha%}, who was defended by {%Koṭikāsya%}.
The {%Trigarta%} king, who had killed the four steeds of
[Page261-a+ 63]
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his mace, was himself killed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
who then, together with {%Indrasena%}, mounted the chariot of
{%Sahadeva. Nakula%} killed {%Kṣemaṅkara%} and {%Mahāmukha%}, and
was compelled by the Trigarta king {%Suratha%} (whom he
killed?) to mount {%Bhīma's%} chariot. {%Bhīma%} put {%Koṭikāsya%} to
flight and slew him. {%Arjuna%} killed the twelve {%Sauvīra%}
heroes, etc.; {%Jayadratha%} put {%Draupadī%} down and fled.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, seeing {%Draupadī%} and {%Dhaumya%} walking in front,
caused her to be taken up on the chariot of {%Sahadeva%}.
{%Arjuna%} advised {%Bhīma%} to refrain from slaying the
remnant of the {%Saindhava%} host. {%Bhīma%} prevailed upon
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to return to the hermitage with the twins
and {%Draupadī%} and {%Dhaumya%}, while he himself would
find out and slay {%Jayadratha. Yudhiṣṭhira%} entreated him
not to slay him, remembering {%Duḥśalā%} and {%Gāndhārī%}; but
{%Draupadī%} indignantly required that he should be slain, and
{%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} went in search of him. In the hermitage
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} found {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} and many other {%brahmans%}
and ascetics, who were greatly bewailing the lot of {%Draupadī%}.
Meanwhile {%Arjuna%} killed the horses of {%Jayadratha%}, though
they were a full {%krośa%} ahead of him. {%Jayadratha%} was then
overtaken by {%Bhīma%}, but {%Arjuna%} entreated {%Bhīma%} not to kill
him (III, {@271@}).
