<div n="lb">three cities in heaven: one of iron (belonging to {%Vidyun-%}
<div n="lb">{%mālin),%} one of silver (belonging to {%Tārakākṣa%}), and one of
<div n="lb">gold (belonging to {%Kamalākṣa%}); {%Indra%} could not vanquish
<div n="lb">them; the gods repaired to {%Rudra%} and promised him the
<div n="lb">creatures slain in every sacrifice. {%Śiva%} then made {%Gandha-%}

<div n="lb">Adored by gods and ṛṣis he adopted a posture called after

<div n="lb">shot that terrible shaft of three knots, inspired with the {%Yuga%}
<div n="lb">fire and composed of {%Viṣṇu%} and {%Soma.%} While the triple
<div n="lb">city began to burn, {%Pārvatī%} repaired thither to behold the
<div n="lb">sight; she had on her lap a child having a bald head with
<div n="lb">five tufts of hair on it; {%Indra%} endeavoured to strike the
<div n="lb">child with the thunderbolt, but {%Mahādeva%} (i.e. the child)
<div n="lb">paralysed his arm. {%Indra,%} with the gods, repaired to
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} who, understanding that it was {%Śiva,%} came with
