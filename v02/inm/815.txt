{@Arjunavanavāsaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to
<div n="lb">Arjuna's dwelling in the wood,” the 16th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans of Mhbhr.). § 247: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} continued to
<div n="lb">reside there, and by their prowess they brought many kings
<div n="lb">under their sway, and on account of their virtue the whole
<div n="lb">race of the {%Kurus%} grew in prosperity. After some time robbers
<div n="lb">lifted the cattle of a {%brahman,%} who then repaired to {%Khāṇḍava-%}
<div n="lb">{%prastha%} and reproved the {%Pāṇḍavas. Arjuna%} heard it; but the
<div n="lb">chamber where the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had their weapons being then
<div n="lb">occupied by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with {%Kṛṣṇā, Arjuna%} was obliged
<div n="lb">to violate the established rule by entering the chamber.
<div n="lb">Then, armed with the bow and attired in mail and riding on
<div n="lb">his war-chariot decked with flagstaffs, he pursued the thieves
<div n="lb">and compelled them to give up the booty. Then, notwith-
<div n="lb">standing {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} objections, he went to the forest to
<div n="lb">live there for twelve years (I, {@213@}).—§ 248: {%Arjuna%} set
<div n="lb">out followed by {%brahmans%} conversant with the {%vedas%} and
<div n="lb">{%vedāṅgas%} and devoted to the contemplation of the Supreme
<div n="lb">Spirit {%(adhyātmacintakāḥ),%} by mendicants {%(bhaikṣāḥ)%} devoted to
<div n="lb">{%Bhagavat (Bhagavadbhaktāḥ),%} by reciters of the {%Purāṇas (sūtāḥ%}
<div n="lb">{%Paurāṇikāḥ),%} and by reciters of sacred stories {%(divyākhyānāni),%}
<div n="lb">etc., and settled at {%Gaṅgādvāra,%} where the {%brahmans%} performed
<div n="lb">innumerable {%agnihotras.%} One day when {%Arjuna%} had performed
<div n="lb">his ablutions in the {%Gaṅgā,%} and offered the oblations of water to
<div n="lb">his deceased ancestors, and when he was about to rise up from
[Page090-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the stream desirous of performing his sacrificial rites before
<div n="lb">the fire, he was drawn away to the bottom of the water by
<div n="lb">{%Ulūpī,%} the daughter of the {%Nāga%} king {%Kauravya%} of the lineage
<div n="lb">of {%Airāvata,%} urged by the god of desire. There he saw
<div n="lb">a sacrificial fire, where he performed his sacrificial rites, by
<div n="lb">which {%Agni%} was much gratified. {%Ulūpī%} persuaded him that
<div n="lb">it was a greater merit to give himself up to her than to keep
<div n="lb">the vow of a {%brahmacārin,%} and having spent the night there,
<div n="lb">he in the morning, accompanied by {%Ulūpī,%} came back to
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgādvāra. Ulūpī,%} taking leave of him there, said that he
<div n="lb">would be invincible in water (I, {@214@}).—§ 249: Then he
<div n="lb">set out towards the {%Himavat%} and came to {%Agastyavaṭa%}
<div n="lb">and the mountain of {%Vasiṣṭha;%} in {%Bhṛgutuṅga%} he bestowed
<div n="lb">many thousands of kine, etc., on {%brahmans%} and visited
<div n="lb">many {%tīrthas%} (especially all those in {%Aṅga, Vaṅga,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kaliṅga%}). At the gate of the kingdom of {%Kaliṅga%} the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} desisted from following him further; he crossed
<div n="lb">{%Kaliṅga,%} beheld the {%Mahendra%} mountain adorned with the
<div n="lb">ascetics, and went to {%Maṇipūra,%} proceeding slowly along the
<div n="lb">seaṣore. There he married {%Citrāṅgadā,%} the daughter of king
<div n="lb">{%Citravāhana (b),%} and dwelt there for three years. When
<div n="lb">{%Citrāṅgadā%} had given birth to a son, {%Arjuna%} set out on his
<div n="lb">wanderings again (I, {@215@}).—§ 250: Then {%Arjuna%} went to
<div n="lb">the {%tīrthas%} at the southern ocean. There five {%tīrthas%} were
<div n="lb">shunned on account of five crocodiles that seized the devotees:
<div n="lb">{%Agastyatīrtha, Saubhadra, Pauloma, Kārandhama%} (giving the
<div n="lb">results of a horse-sacrifice), and {%Bhāradvāja's tīrtha. Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">plunged into the {%Saubhadra%} (so called after a {%maharṣi%}), and
<div n="lb">was seized by a crocodile, which he dragged to the shore.
<div n="lb">It then became the {%apsaras Vargā,%} the friend of {%Dhanapati%}
<div n="lb">(Kubera). When she with her four companions ({%Saurabheyī,%}
<div n="lb">{%Samīcī, Vudvudā,%} and {%Latā%}), going to the abode of {%Kubera,%}
<div n="lb">had in vain tempted an ascetic {%brahman,%} that {%brahman%} had
<div n="lb">cursed them, saying that they should become crocodiles for
<div n="lb">100 years (I, {@216@}). {%Vargā%} said: “As we asked the {%ṛṣi%}
<div n="lb">to grant us pardon, he said: ‘100 and 100,000 are all
<div n="lb">indicative of eternity; but the words 100 as employed by me
<div n="lb">is to be understood as a limited period; you will be delivered
<div n="lb">by an exalted individual, and those waters shall become
<div n="lb">sacred and purifying under the name of {%Nārītīrthāni.%}’ The
<div n="lb">{%devarṣi Nārada%} directed us to these lakes, and said that
<div n="lb">{%Dhanañjaya%} (i.e. Arjuna) would soon deliver us.” {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">then also delivered the other four {%apsarases.%} Then he pro-
<div n="lb">ceeded to {%Maṇipūra%} to see {%Citrāṅgadā;%} with her he had
<div n="lb">begotten king {%Babhruvāhana.%} Then he proceeded towards
<div n="lb">{%Gokarṇa%} (I, {@217@}).—§ 251: Then {%Arjuna%} visited the {%tīrthas%}
<div n="lb">on the shores of the western ocean, and arrived at {%Prabhāsa.%}
<div n="lb">There {%Madhusūdana%} (= Kṛṣṇa) visited him, and he and
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} who were the {%ṛṣis Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa,%} sported
<div n="lb">there for some time. Then they went to the {%Raivataka%}
<div n="lb">mountain, after {%Kṛṣṇa%} had caused this mountain to be well
<div n="lb">adorned by many artifices; there he saw the performances
<div n="lb">of the actors and the dancers. The next morning they set
<div n="lb">out for {%Dvārakā,%} welcomed by the {%Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Andhakas.%} There he dwelt in the mansion of {%Kṛṣṇa%} for
<div n="lb">many days (I, {@218@}).
