{@Arjunavanavāsaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to
Arjuna's dwelling in the wood,” the 16th of the minor
parvans of Mhbhr.). § 247: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} continued to
reside there, and by their prowess they brought many kings
under their sway, and on account of their virtue the whole
race of the {%Kurus%} grew in prosperity. After some time robbers
lifted the cattle of a {%brahman%}, who then repaired to {%Khāṇḍava-%}
{%prastha%} and reproved the {%Pāṇḍavas. Arjuna%} heard it; but the
chamber where the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had their weapons being then
occupied by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with {%Kṛṣṇā, Arjuna%} was obliged
to violate the established rule by entering the chamber.
Then, armed with the bow and attired in mail and riding on
his war-chariot decked with flagstaffs, he pursued the thieves
and compelled them to give up the booty. Then, notwith-
standing {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} objections, he went to the forest to
live there for twelve years (I, {@213@}).—§ 248: {%Arjuna%} set
out followed by {%brahmans%} conversant with the {%vedas%} and
{%vedāṅgas%} and devoted to the contemplation of the Supreme
Spirit ({%adhyātmacintakāḥ%}), by mendicants ({%bhaikṣāḥ%}) devoted to
{%Bhagavat (Bhagavadbhaktāḥ%}), by reciters of the {%Purāṇas (sūtāḥ%}
{%Paurāṇikāḥ%}), and by reciters of sacred stories ({%divyākhyānāni%}),
etc., and settled at {%Gaṅgādvāra%}, where the {%brahmans%} performed
innumerable {%agnihotras%}. One day when {%Arjuna%} had performed
his ablutions in the {%Gaṅgā%}, and offered the oblations of water to
his deceased ancestors, and when he was about to rise up from
[Page090-a+ 63]
the stream desirous of performing his sacrificial rites before
the fire, he was drawn away to the bottom of the water by
{%Ulūpī%}, the daughter of the {%Nāga%} king {%Kauravya%} of the lineage
of {%Airāvata%}, urged by the god of desire. There he saw
a sacrificial fire, where he performed his sacrificial rites, by
which {%Agni%} was much gratified. {%Ulūpī%} persuaded him that
it was a greater merit to give himself up to her than to keep
the vow of a {%brahmacārin%}, and having spent the night there,
he in the morning, accompanied by {%Ulūpī%}, came back to
{%Gaṅgādvāra. Ulūpī%}, taking leave of him there, said that he
would be invincible in water (I, {@214@}).—§ 249: Then he
set out towards the {%Himavat%} and came to {%Agastyavaṭa%}
and the mountain of {%Vasiṣṭha%}; in {%Bhṛgutuṅga%} he bestowed
many thousands of kine, etc., on {%brahmans%} and visited
many {%tīrthas%} (especially all those in {%Aṅga, Vaṅga%}, and
{%Kaliṅga%}). At the gate of the kingdom of {%Kaliṅga%} the
{%brahmans%} desisted from following him further; he crossed
{%Kaliṅga%}, beheld the {%Mahendra%} mountain adorned with the
ascetics, and went to {%Maṇipūra%}, proceeding slowly along the
seaṣore. There he married {%Citrāṅgadā%}, the daughter of king
{%Citravāhana (b%}), and dwelt there for three years. When
{%Citrāṅgadā%} had given birth to a son, {%Arjuna%} set out on his
wanderings again (I, {@215@}).—§ 250: Then {%Arjuna%} went to
the {%tīrthas%} at the southern ocean. There five {%tīrthas%} were
shunned on account of five crocodiles that seized the devotees:
{%Agastyatīrtha, Saubhadra, Pauloma, Kārandhama%} (giving the
results of a horse-sacrifice), and {%Bhāradvāja's tīrtha. Arjuna%}
plunged into the {%Saubhadra%} (so called after a {%maharṣi%}), and
was seized by a crocodile, which he dragged to the shore.
It then became the {%apsaras Vargā%}, the friend of {%Dhanapati%}
(Kubera). When she with her four companions ({%Saurabheyī%},
{%Samīcī, Vudvudā%}, and {%Latā%}), going to the abode of {%Kubera%},
had in vain tempted an ascetic {%brahman%}, that {%brahman%} had
cursed them, saying that they should become crocodiles for
100 years (I, {@216@}). {%Vargā%} said: “As we asked the {%ṛṣi%}
to grant us pardon, he said: ‘100 and 100,000 are all
indicative of eternity; but the words 100 as employed by me
is to be understood as a limited period; you will be delivered
by an exalted individual, and those waters shall become
sacred and purifying under the name of {%Nārītīrthāni%}.’ The
{%devarṣi Nārada%} directed us to these lakes, and said that
{%Dhanañjaya%} (i.e. Arjuna) would soon deliver us.” {%Arjuna%}
then also delivered the other four {%apsarases%}. Then he pro-
ceeded to {%Maṇipūra%} to see {%Citrāṅgadā%}; with her he had
begotten king {%Babhruvāhana%}. Then he proceeded towards
{%Gokarṇa%} (I, {@217@}).—§ 251: Then {%Arjuna%} visited the {%tīrthas%}
on the shores of the western ocean, and arrived at {%Prabhāsa%}.
There {%Madhusūdana%} (= Kṛṣṇa) visited him, and he and
{%Arjuna%}, who were the {%ṛṣis Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}, sported
there for some time. Then they went to the {%Raivataka%}
mountain, after {%Kṛṣṇa%} had caused this mountain to be well
adorned by many artifices; there he saw the performances
of the actors and the dancers. The next morning they set
out for {%Dvārakā%}, welcomed by the {%Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis%}, and
{%Andhakas%}. There he dwelt in the mansion of {%Kṛṣṇa%} for
many days (I, {@218@}).
