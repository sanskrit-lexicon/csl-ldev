[{@Indravijaya(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the victory of Indra”). § 555:
<div n="lb">Questioned by Yudhiṣṭhira about the misery endured by
<div n="lb">Indra and Śacī, Śalya related: Once the Prajāpati Tvaṣṭṛ,
<div n="lb">from antipathy to Indra, created a son who had three heads
<div n="lb">(one for reading the Vedas; the second for drinking wine; with
<div n="lb">the third he looked as if he were about to absorb the four
<div n="lb">quarters), called Viśvarūpa. Beholding his austerities, Indra
<div n="lb">became alarmed, and in vain caused Apsarases to tempt him;
<div n="lb">then he slew him with his thunderbolt (thinking, “I shall
<div n="lb">afterwards perform some religious ceremony”), but was yet
<div n="lb">afraid of his appearance, and prevailed upon a carpenter to
<div n="lb">cut off the heads (promising, “in sacrifices men will give thee
<div n="lb">the head of the sacrificial animal as thy share”); out flew
<div n="lb">birds—(1) partridges, (2) sparrows and hawks, (3) quails.
<div n="lb">Then Tvaṣṭṛ created Vṛtra, who swallowed up Indra. The
<div n="lb">gods created Jṛmbhikā (“yawning”); Vṛtra yawned (there-
<div n="lb">fore yawn attaches itself to the living breath of animated
<div n="lb">beings), and Indra emerged. Tvaṣṭṛ strengthened Vṛtra;
<div n="lb">Indra returned; the gods consulted with the munis, and
<div n="lb">sitting on Mount Mandara, they thought of Viṣṇu (V, {@9@}).
<div n="lb">Indra, with D. and Ṛ., repaired to Viṣṇu {%(b),%} who taught
<div n="lb">them, with Ṛ. and G., to make eternal friendship between
<div n="lb">Indra and Vṛtra (“I may not be killed either by what is dry
<div n="lb">or wet, stone, wood, weapons, by day or night, by Indra or
<div n="lb">D.,” said Vṛtra). Indra then slew him in the evening with
<div n="lb">froth blended with the thunderbolt, in which Viṣṇu had
<div n="lb">entered. D., G., Y., Rā., M.-U., and Ṛ. glorified Indra.
<div n="lb">But Indra was overpowered by falsehood {%(anṛta)%} and
<div n="lb">brahmanicide {%(brahmahatyā),%} and became bereft of his
<div n="lb">consciousness, and lay concealed in water; the earth became
<div n="lb">treeless, the rivers were interrupted, the rains ceased (V, {@10@}).
<div n="lb">Then Ṛ. and D. (also P. and G., ch. {@16@}) crowned Nahuṣa
<div n="lb">as king of D., giving him their tapas: “whatever being may
<div n="lb">stand within thy sight—D., Dā., Y., Rā., P., G., Bh.—thou
<div n="lb">shalt absorb his power.” Nahuṣa then assumed a sensual
<div n="lb">turn of mind, amusing himself with Aps. and devakanyāḥ
<div n="lb">and Viśvāvasu, Nārada, G., and the six seasons, in
<div n="lb">Nandana, and on Kailāsa, Himavat, Mandara, Śveta, Sahya,
<div n="lb">Mahendra, Malaya, etc. He ordained that Śacī should
<div n="lb">wait upon him. Śacī {%(c)%} repaired to Bṛhaspati, who
<div n="lb">promised soon to unite her with Indra (V, {@11@}). Nahuṣa
<div n="lb">became enraged; the earth, with As., G., K., M.-U., trembled;
[Page344-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">Nahuṣa reminded of Indra's behaviour towards Ahalyā {%(d),%}
<div n="lb">etc.; at last the gods promised to bring him Śacī; but
<div n="lb">Bṛhaspati, as a brahman, would not abandon her, quoting
<div n="lb">a saying of Brahmán {%(e);%} he told her to ask for time from
<div n="lb">Nahuṣa, and so did the gods, led by Agni (V, {@12@}). Śacī
<div n="lb">obtained the boon from Nahuṣa, and returned to Bṛhaspati.
<div n="lb">D., with Agni, repaired to Viṣṇu, who said: “Let Indra offer
<div n="lb">sacrifice to me; having performed the horse-sacrifice, he will
<div n="lb">regain his dignity.” D. and Ṛ. and Bṛhaspati proceeded to
<div n="lb">the spot where Indra was, performed a Horse-sacrifice, and
<div n="lb">divided the {%brahmahatyā%} among trees and rivers and mountains
<div n="lb">and earth and women; and Indra was free from fever, but
<div n="lb">vanished again from fear of Nahuṣa. Śacī worshipped Niśā
<div n="lb">(Night), who caused Upaśruti to appear, and Śacī prayed to
<div n="lb">Upaśruti (V, {@13@}). Upaśruti, followed by Śacī, crossed the
<div n="lb">heavenly groves and many mountains and came to the northern
<div n="lb">side of Himavat, and thence to the sea; in an island there
<div n="lb">was a large lake with an assemblage of lotuses; there they
<div n="lb">found Indra in the fibres of a lotus-stalk, and, praising him,
<div n="lb">Śacī implored his help against Nahuṣa (V, {@14@}). Indra said
<div n="lb">that Nahuṣa had been strengthened by the Ṛ. with the merits
<div n="lb">of offerings to D. and P. Śacī should tell Nahuṣa to visit
<div n="lb">her on a vehicle borne by Ṛ. Nahuṣa consented. Śacī
<div n="lb">prevailed upon Bṛhaspati to find out Indra, which he did by
<div n="lb">means of a sacrifice, prevailing upon Agni to search for him.
<div n="lb">Agni came back within the twinkling of an eye, having
<div n="lb">searched everywhere except in the waters, which he dared not
<div n="lb">enter (“fire rose from water, the kṣatriya caste from the
<div n="lb">brāhmaṇa caste, and iron from stone; the power of these,
<div n="lb">which can penetrate all other things, has no operation upon
<div n="lb">the sources from which they sprang”) (V, {@15@}). Bṛhaspati
<div n="lb">praised Agni {%(f)%} and strengthened him with hymns of the
<div n="lb">Veda; Agni then found out Indra (cf. ch. {@14@}), and soon
<div n="lb">returned and informed Bṛhaspati. This came with D.-ṛ. and
<div n="lb">G., and praised Indra by referring to his former deeds (that
<div n="lb">he had killed the great Asura Namuci and the Asura
<div n="lb">Śambara and Vala and Vṛtra, as {%supra%}). Indra increased
<div n="lb">little by little, and having assumed his original form he grew
<div n="lb">strong, and asked what business yet remained, as he had
<div n="lb">killed Viśvarūpa and Vṛtra. Bṛhaspati told him of Nahuṣa,
<div n="lb">who had been strengthened by the power of the D.-ṛ., etc.
<div n="lb">(v. ch. {@11@}), and how Nahuṣa, carried by M.-ṛ., journeyed
<div n="lb">from world to world. Lp. Kubera and Yama Vaivasvata and
<div n="lb">Soma and Varuṇa came and rejoiced that Viśvarūpa and Vṛtra
<div n="lb">had been killed, and they and Agni promised him their
<div n="lb">assistance against Nahuṣa on the condition that they and Agni
<div n="lb">should have their shares in sacrifices, and that Kubera {%(g),%}
<div n="lb">Yama {%(h),%} and Varuṇa {%(i)%} should this day be crowned
<div n="lb">along with Indra (V, {@16@}). While Indra, with Lp. and D.,
<div n="lb">was considering the means of slaying Nahuṣa, the M.-ṛ.
<div n="lb">Agastya came and rejoiced that Viśvarūpa and Vṛtra had
<div n="lb">been killed, and related how Nahuṣa had been hurled from
<div n="lb">heaven (Svarga). The D.-ṛ. and B.-ṛ., weary with carrying
<div n="lb">him, had questioned him if certain mantras {%(prokṣaṇe%}
<div n="lb">{%gavāṃ)%} pronounced by Brahmán (so B.) were authentic
<div n="lb">{%(pramāṇaṃ),%} to which Nahuṣa, bewildered by the dark
<div n="lb">principle {%(tamas),%} had answered in the negative; Ṛ. reproached
<div n="lb">him, as M.-ṛ. had formerly declared them to be authentic.
<div n="lb">Nahuṣa touched Agastya's head with his foot, and instantly
<div n="lb">lost his power and luck {%(śrī),%} and was agitated with fear.
<div n="lb">Then Agastya cursed him: “Fall thou from heaven, the
<div n="lb">effect of all thy good deeds {%(puṇya)%} has been exhausted; for
<div n="lb">10,000 years thou shalt be a snake upon earth; then thou
[Page345-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">mayst come back to Svarga.” D., M.-ṛ., P., Y., Sp. {%(bhujagāḥ),%}
<div n="lb">Rā., G., devakanyāḥ, and the bands of Aps., and tanks,
<div n="lb">rivers, mountains, and the sea came and rejoiced (V, {@17@}).
<div n="lb">Indra, glorified by G. and Aps., mounted Airāvata. Agni,
<div n="lb">the M.-ṛ., Bṛhaspati, Yama, Varuṇa, and Kubera accompanied
<div n="lb">him. Indra went to the three worlds with D., G., and Aps.,
<div n="lb">and was praised by Aṅgiras (i.e. Bṛhaspati?) with hymns of
<div n="lb">the Atharvaveda. Then he granted Atharvāṅgiras (= Aṅgiras)
<div n="lb">the boon that his name would be connected with this Veda
<div n="lb">and that he would get a share in sacrifices. United with
<div n="lb">Śacī he protected the world virtuously (V, {@18@}).
