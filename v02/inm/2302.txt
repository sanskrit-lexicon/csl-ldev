[{@Śākulopākhyāna(ṃ)@}],¦ “the episode about the Śakula
<div n="lb">fishes.” § 645{%b%} (Āpaddh.): In a lake that was not very
<div n="lb">deep and which abounded in fishes, there lived three {%Śakula%}
<div n="lb">fishes ({%kuśalās%} in B. seems only to be a typographical error)
<div n="lb">that were friends; amongst those three, one had much fore-
<div n="lb">thought {%(dīrghakālajñaḥ);%} another was possessed of great
<div n="lb">presence of mind {%(utpannapratibhaḥ);%} the third was pro-
<div n="lb">crastinating {%(dīrghasūtraḥ).%} One day certain fishermen
<div n="lb">coming to that lake began to bale out its waters to a lower
<div n="lb">ground through diverse outlets. He of great forethought,
<div n="lb">having in vain warned the others, immediately set out
<div n="lb">through a current and reached another deep lake. The
<div n="lb">procrastinating one was caught with many others and tied to
<div n="lb">a string. He of presence of mind thrust himself into the
<div n="lb">company of those so tied, and remained quietly among them
<div n="lb">biting the string, and escaped when the fishes were removed
<div n="lb">to a piece of deep water to be washed. The procrastinating
<div n="lb">one met with his death (XII, {@137@}).
