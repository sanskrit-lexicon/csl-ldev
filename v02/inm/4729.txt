{@[Jalapradānikaparvan]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
gift of water to the deceased,” the 85th of the minor parvans
of the Mhbhr.; cf. Jalapradānika). § 618: {%Janamejaya%}
inquired of {%Vaiśampāyana%} as to what {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>),
did after the death of {%Duryodhana. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} grief;
{%Sañjaya%} comforted him, and suggested the performance of the
obsequious rites of the fallen heroes. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} lamented
(<lang n="greek">β</lang>); {%Sañjaya%} rebuked and consoled him (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Vidura%} addressed
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (XI, {@1@}) and comforted him (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (XI, {@2@}); charmed
by {%Vidura's%} discourse, {%Dhrtarāṣtra%} asked him to continue his
observations on the vanity of human life; {%Vidura%} continued his
discourse, and described human life as it runs (XI, {@3@}) from
the very beginning (XI, {@4@}), comparing it to a wilderness
[Page347-a+ 63]
abounding with dangers (XI, {@5@}), explaining the comparison
according to the religion of {%Mokṣa%} (XI, {@6@}); asked by {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra, Vidura%} continued his discourse on human life (XI, {@7@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away, but was comforted by {%Vyāsa%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), wept and lamented; {%Vyāsa%} comforted him by explaining
the secret history of the slaughter (he had seen the Earth in
{%Indra's%} hall, complaining before the gods and D.-ṛ. and {%Nārada%},
and {%Viṣṇu%} consoling her, saying that {%Duryodhana%} would
cause her burden to be lightened by a battle in {%Kurukṣetra%}),
etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} promised to live; {%Vyāsa%} disappeared
(XI, {@8@}). Requested by {%Janamejaya%} (<lang n="greek">η</lang>), {%Vaiśampāyana%}
related: After {%Duryodhana%} had been slain, and all the troops
slaughtered, {%Sañjaya%}, deprived of his spiritual sight, came
back to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and recommended him to cause the
obsequial rites to be performed. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away;
{%Vidura%} comforted him (“Time drags all kinds of creatures
away,” etc.) (XI, {@9@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} resolved to visit the
field of battle with the {%Kuru%} ladies in his company. The
{%Kuru%} ladies ({%Gāndhārī, Kuntī%}, etc.) were placed in chariots
under {%Vidura's%} supervision; the royal household, with a large
number of the citizens, started from {%Hāstinapura%} (XI, {@10@}).
Having proceeded a {%krośa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} met with {%Aśvatthā-%}
{%man%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>). {%Kṛpa%} related to {%Gāndhārī%} the fall of {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} in unfair fight, and their nightly attack on the camp
of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>); then {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc., took leave of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} in order to conceal themselves from the wrath of
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and urged their steeds to wards the banks of the
{%Gaṅgā%}, where they separated from one another: {%Kṛpa%} went
to {%Hāstinapura; Kṛtavarman%} to his own kingdom; {%Aśvatthā-%}
{%man%} set out for the abode of {%Vyāsa%}; “before the sun
rose; it was after this that the sons of {%Pāṇḍu%} encountered
{%Aśvatthāman%} and vanquished him” (XI, {@11@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and
his brothers set out in order to meet {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, accompanied
by {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>); they met the weeping ladies of the
royal house on the way (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>), and saluted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who
reluctantly embraced {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and broke an iron statue
of {%Bhīma%} (that had been kept ready by {%Kṛṣṇa%}), mistaking it
for {%Bhīma%} himself; he then grieved for having slain {%Bhīma%}, fell
down, and was raised by his charioteer {%Sañjaya; Kṛṣṇa%}
enlightened him, and told him not to cherish wrath (XI, {@12@}).
Certain maid-servants came and washed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}; then
{%Kṛṣṇa%} again addressed him, assuring him that the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
were perfectly innocent (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>); then {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} embraced
{%Bhīma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>) (XI, {@13@}). Commanded by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, the
{%Pāṇḍava%} brothers with {%Kṛṣṇa%} then proceeded to see {%Gān-%}
{%dhārī%}, who wished to curse {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. The great Ṛ. {%Vyāsa%},
capable of proceeding everywhere with the fleetness of the
wind, and capable of seeing the heart of every creature with
his spiritual vision, understood her evil intentions, and having
cleansed himself by the water of the {%Gaṅgā%}, he suddenly
appeared, and told her not to be angry with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, but
remember that she had every day for the eighteen days that
battle lasted, when {%Duryodhana%} asked her to bless him, said:
“Thither goes victory where righteousness is.” {%Gāndhārī%}
admitted that she and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} should protect the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} with as much care as {%Kuntī%} herself protected them,
the fault being with {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>); but {%Bhīma's%} unfair
combat with {%Duryodhana%} in the presence of {%Kṛṣṇa%} moved
her wrath (XI, {@14@}). {%Bhīma%} addressed {%Gāndhārī%}, and
extenuated his fault in having slain {%Duryodhana%} unfairly
(“{%Duryodhana%} had formerly himself vanquished {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
unfairly,” etc.) (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>). {%Gāndhārī%} then blamed {%Bhīma%} for
drinking {%Duḥśāsana's%} blood, when {%Vṛṣasena%} had deprived
[Page347-b+ 63]
{%Nakula%} of his steeds; {%Bhīma%} denied that he had really drunk
{%Duḥśāsana's%} blood; “{%Karṇa%} knew this well; seeing {%Nakula%}
deprived by {%Vṛṣasena%} of his steeds, I caused the rejoicing
brothers to be filled with dread; when the tresses of
{%Draupadī%} were seized, I uttered certain words in rage;
I dared not leave that vow unaccomplished lest I should be
regarded as having swerved from the duties of a {%kṣatriya.”%}
{%Gāndhārī%} then inquired after {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who appeared
before her and invoked her curses on himself for his sinful
slaughter of all her sons; {%Gāndhārī's%} glance (under the cloth
that covered her eyes) blasted a nail of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} toe.
{%Arjuna%} moved away to the seat of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and also the other
{%Pāṇḍavas%} became restless. {%Gāndhārī%} then comforted the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and dismissed them. They then met with their
mother {%Kuntī%}, who wept seeing their many sears. {%Draupadī%}
wept for her children and {%Abhimanyu; Kuntī%} consoled her,
and so did {%Gāndhārī%} (mentioning {%Vidura's%} predictions)
(XI, {@15@}).
