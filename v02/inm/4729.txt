{@[Jalapradānikaparvan]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">gift of water to the deceased,” the 85th of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of the Mhbhr.; cf. Jalapradānika). § 618: {%Janamejaya%}
<div n="lb">inquired of {%Vaiśampāyana%} as to what {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">did after the death of {%Duryodhana. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} grief;
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} comforted him, and suggested the performance of the
<div n="lb">obsequious rites of the fallen heroes. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} lamented
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Sañjaya%} rebuked and consoled him (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vidura%} addressed
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (XI, {@1@}) and comforted him (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XI, {@2@}); charmed
<div n="lb">by {%Vidura's%} discourse, {%Dhrtarāṣtra%} asked him to continue his
<div n="lb">observations on the vanity of human life; {%Vidura%} continued his
<div n="lb">discourse, and described human life as it runs (XI, {@3@}) from
<div n="lb">the very beginning (XI, {@4@}), comparing it to a wilderness
[Page347-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">abounding with dangers (XI, {@5@}), explaining the comparison
<div n="lb">according to the religion of {%Mokṣa%} (XI, {@6@}); asked by {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra, Vidura%} continued his discourse on human life (XI, {@7@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away, but was comforted by {%Vyāsa,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), wept and lamented; {%Vyāsa%} comforted him by explaining
<div n="lb">the secret history of the slaughter (he had seen the Earth in
<div n="lb">{%Indra's%} hall, complaining before the gods and D.-ṛ. and {%Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Viṣṇu%} consoling her, saying that {%Duryodhana%} would
<div n="lb">cause her burden to be lightened by a battle in {%Kurukṣetra%}),
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} promised to live; {%Vyāsa%} disappeared
<div n="lb">(XI, {@8@}). Requested by {%Janamejaya%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">related: After {%Duryodhana%} had been slain, and all the troops
<div n="lb">slaughtered, {%Sañjaya,%} deprived of his spiritual sight, came
<div n="lb">back to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and recommended him to cause the
<div n="lb">obsequial rites to be performed. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away;
<div n="lb">{%Vidura%} comforted him (“Time drags all kinds of creatures
<div n="lb">away,” etc.) (XI, {@9@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} resolved to visit the
<div n="lb">field of battle with the {%Kuru%} ladies in his company. The
<div n="lb">{%Kuru%} ladies ({%Gāndhārī, Kuntī,%} etc.) were placed in chariots
<div n="lb">under {%Vidura's%} supervision; the royal household, with a large
<div n="lb">number of the citizens, started from {%Hāstinapura%} (XI, {@10@}).
<div n="lb">Having proceeded a {%krośa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} met with {%Aśvatthā-%}
<div n="lb">{%man,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛpa%} related to {%Gāndhārī%} the fall of {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} in unfair fight, and their nightly attack on the camp
<div n="lb">of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc., took leave of
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} in order to conceal themselves from the wrath of
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and urged their steeds to wards the banks of the
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā,%} where they separated from one another: {%Kṛpa%} went
<div n="lb">to {%Hāstinapura; Kṛtavarman%} to his own kingdom; {%Aśvatthā-%}
<div n="lb">{%man%} set out for the abode of {%Vyāsa;%} “before the sun
<div n="lb">rose; it was after this that the sons of {%Pāṇḍu%} encountered
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman%} and vanquished him” (XI, {@11@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and
<div n="lb">his brothers set out in order to meet {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} accompanied
<div n="lb">by {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); they met the weeping ladies of the
<div n="lb">royal house on the way (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and saluted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} who
<div n="lb">reluctantly embraced {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and broke an iron statue
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīma%} (that had been kept ready by {%Kṛṣṇa%}), mistaking it
<div n="lb">for {%Bhīma%} himself; he then grieved for having slain {%Bhīma,%} fell
<div n="lb">down, and was raised by his charioteer {%Sañjaya; Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">enlightened him, and told him not to cherish wrath (XI, {@12@}).
<div n="lb">Certain maid-servants came and washed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra;%} then
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} again addressed him, assuring him that the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">were perfectly innocent (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} embraced
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XI, {@13@}). Commanded by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍava%} brothers with {%Kṛṣṇa%} then proceeded to see {%Gān-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhārī,%} who wished to curse {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} The great Ṛ. {%Vyāsa,%}
<div n="lb">capable of proceeding everywhere with the fleetness of the
<div n="lb">wind, and capable of seeing the heart of every creature with
<div n="lb">his spiritual vision, understood her evil intentions, and having
<div n="lb">cleansed himself by the water of the {%Gaṅgā,%} he suddenly
<div n="lb">appeared, and told her not to be angry with the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} but
<div n="lb">remember that she had every day for the eighteen days that
<div n="lb">battle lasted, when {%Duryodhana%} asked her to bless him, said:
<div n="lb">“Thither goes victory where righteousness is.” {%Gāndhārī%}
<div n="lb">admitted that she and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} should protect the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} with as much care as {%Kuntī%} herself protected them,
<div n="lb">the fault being with {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); but {%Bhīma's%} unfair
<div n="lb">combat with {%Duryodhana%} in the presence of {%Kṛṣṇa%} moved
<div n="lb">her wrath (XI, {@14@}). {%Bhīma%} addressed {%Gāndhārī,%} and
<div n="lb">extenuated his fault in having slain {%Duryodhana%} unfairly
<div n="lb">(“{%Duryodhana%} had formerly himself vanquished {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">unfairly,” etc.) (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Gāndhārī%} then blamed {%Bhīma%} for
<div n="lb">drinking {%Duḥśāsana's%} blood, when {%Vṛṣasena%} had deprived
[Page347-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Nakula%} of his steeds; {%Bhīma%} denied that he had really drunk
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana's%} blood; “{%Karṇa%} knew this well; seeing {%Nakula%}
<div n="lb">deprived by {%Vṛṣasena%} of his steeds, I caused the rejoicing
<div n="lb">brothers to be filled with dread; when the tresses of
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} were seized, I uttered certain words in rage;
<div n="lb">I dared not leave that vow unaccomplished lest I should be
<div n="lb">regarded as having swerved from the duties of a {%kṣatriya.”%}
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī%} then inquired after {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who appeared
<div n="lb">before her and invoked her curses on himself for his sinful
<div n="lb">slaughter of all her sons; {%Gāndhārī's%} glance (under the cloth
<div n="lb">that covered her eyes) blasted a nail of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} toe.
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} moved away to the seat of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and also the other
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} became restless. {%Gāndhārī%} then comforted the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and dismissed them. They then met with their
<div n="lb">mother {%Kuntī,%} who wept seeing their many sears. {%Draupadī%}
<div n="lb">wept for her children and {%Abhimanyu; Kuntī%} consoled her,
<div n="lb">and so did {%Gāndhārī%} (mentioning {%Vidura's%} predictions)
<div n="lb">(XI, {@15@}).
