<div n="lb">§ 461 (Mārkaṇḍeyas.). As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to hear
<div n="lb">about the greatness of {%brahmans, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: King
<div n="lb">{%Parikṣit%} (B. {%Parīkṣit%}), in {%Ayodhyā,%} of the race of {%Ikṣvāku,%}
<div n="lb">was, in the forest, led far away by a deer, and by a tank
<div n="lb">met with a beautiful maiden, who came along singing. He
<div n="lb">married her after having given her the pledge not to let her
<div n="lb">see water, and having arrived at his capital he lived with
<div n="lb">her in privacy, and nobody could obtain any interview with
<div n="lb">him. His chief minister, having found out the matter, made
<div n="lb">an artificial forest, with a tank covered with a net of pearls,
<div n="lb">and showed it to the king. The king told his wife to plunge
<div n="lb">into this tank. She did so, and did not reappear. When
<div n="lb">the water had been baled out a frog was found. The king
<div n="lb">ordered all frogs to be slaughtered. {%Āyu,%} the king of the
<div n="lb">frogs, in the shape of an ascetic (quoting two {%ślokas:%} “Do
<div n="lb">not wish to kill the frogs, etc.”), told him that the queen
<div n="lb">was his daughter {%Suśobhanā,%} who had deceived many kings.
<div n="lb">She was restored to the king, but {%Āyu%} cursed her, saying:
<div n="lb">“Thy offspring shall prove disrespectful to brahmans.”
<div n="lb">{%Parikṣit%} begot three sons on her: {%Śala, Dala,%} and {%Bala.%}
<div n="lb">Having installed {%Śala%} on the throne, {%Parikṣit%} retired to the
<div n="lb">wood. One day, {%Śala,%} as he could not overtake a deer, forced
<div n="lb">his charioteer to indicate to him, to whom the {%Vāmya%} horses be-
<div n="lb">longed. He borrowed them from the {%ṛṣi Vāmadeva%} and caught
<div n="lb">the deer, but did not return them. After a month, {%Vāmadeva%}
<div n="lb">in vain sent his disciple {%Ātreya,%} and then came himself, and
<div n="lb">asked for the steeds. The king, saying that such horses were
<div n="lb">not fit for brahmans, in vain offered to give him two bulls, then
<div n="lb">four asses or four mules, and as he threatened to let him be
<div n="lb">killed, {%Vāmadeva,%} saying that {%brahmans%} could not be punished,
<div n="lb">let four {%Rākṣasas%} slay him with their lances. {%Dala,%} whom
<div n="lb">the {%Ikṣvākus%} installed on the throne, attempted to shoot
<div n="lb">{%Vāmadeva%} with a poisoned arrow, but shot his own son
<div n="lb">{%Śyenajit,%} and was unable to discharge another poisoned arrow.
<div n="lb">Then he gave way, and, advised by {%Vāmadeva,%} he touched his
<div n="lb">queen with the arrow and was thus purified of his sin. The
<div n="lb">queen obtained the boon from {%Vāmadeva,%} that she might
<div n="lb">prevail upon her husband that they both should serve the
<div n="lb">{%brahmans,%} and he be freed from his sin, and that {%Vāmadeva%}
<div n="lb">should think of their weal. The king became glad and
<div n="lb">restored the {%Vāmya%} horses (III, {@192@}).
