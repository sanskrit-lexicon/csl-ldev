{@Setubandhana(ṃ)@}¦ (“the building of the bridge”). § 535
<div n="lb">(cf. Rāmopākhyānap.): The monkey chiefs (<lang n="greek"></lang>) began to flock
<div n="lb">together to {%Rāma%} and {%Sugrīva%} on {%Mālyavat.%} On a lucky
<div n="lb">day the army set out. {%Hanūmat%} was in the van, {%Lakṣmaṇa%}
<div n="lb">in the rear, the army was protected by {%Nala,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
[Page637-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">Arriving at the shore of the milky ocean ({%kṣīrodaṃ…%}
<div n="lb">{%sāgaraṃ,%} v. 16289), {%Rāma%} thought of means of crossing it. He
<div n="lb">and {%Lakṣmaṇa%} lay down on the seashore, the Ocean appeared
<div n="lb">to him in a vision and said: “I also have sprung from the
<div n="lb">race of Ikṣvāku; the monkey {%Nala%} is a son of {%Tvaṣṭr,%}
<div n="lb">whatever he will throw into my waters I will support.”
<div n="lb">{%Nala%} then built a bridge, which to this day is known as
<div n="lb">{%Nalasetu.%} At this time {%Vibhīṣaṇa%} with four of his counsellors
<div n="lb">came to {%Rāma. Sugrīva%} suspected him to be a spy, but
<div n="lb">{%Rāma%} installed him in the sovereignty of all the {%Rākṣasas%}
<div n="lb">and made him his own counsellor and the friend of {%Lakṣmaṇa.%}
<div n="lb">It was under the guidance of {%Vibhīṣaṇa%} that the army crossed
<div n="lb">the bridge in a month. {%Rāma%} then caused the gardens of
<div n="lb">{%Laṅkā%} to be devastated by his monkeys. {%Rāvaṇa's%} counsellors
<div n="lb">{%Śuka%} and {%Sāraṇa%} came as spies and were seized by {%Vibhīṣaṇa,%}
<div n="lb">but dismissed by {%Rāma. Rāma%} then sent {%Aṅgada%} as his
<div n="lb">envoy to {%Rāvaṇa%} (III, {@283@}).
