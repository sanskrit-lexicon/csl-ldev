{@Setubandhana(ṃ)@}¦ (“the building of the bridge”). § 535
(cf. Rāmopākhyānap.): The monkey chiefs (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) began to flock
together to {%Rāma%} and {%Sugrīva%} on {%Mālyavat%}. On a lucky
day the army set out. {%Hanūmat%} was in the van, {%Lakṣmaṇa%}
in the rear, the army was protected by {%Nala%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>).
[Page637-a+ 63]
Arriving at the shore of the milky ocean ({%kṣīrodaṃ…%}
{%sāgaraṃ%}, v. 16289), {%Rāma%} thought of means of crossing it. He
and {%Lakṣmaṇa%} lay down on the seashore, the Ocean appeared
to him in a vision and said: “I also have sprung from the
race of Ikṣvāku; the monkey {%Nala%} is a son of {%Tvaṣṭr%},
whatever he will throw into my waters I will support.”
{%Nala%} then built a bridge, which to this day is known as
{%Nalasetu%}. At this time {%Vibhīṣaṇa%} with four of his counsellors
came to {%Rāma. Sugrīva%} suspected him to be a spy, but
{%Rāma%} installed him in the sovereignty of all the {%Rākṣasas%}
and made him his own counsellor and the friend of {%Lakṣmaṇa%}.
It was under the guidance of {%Vibhīṣaṇa%} that the army crossed
the bridge in a month. {%Rāma%} then caused the gardens of
{%Laṅkā%} to be devastated by his monkeys. {%Rāvaṇa's%} counsellors
{%Śuka%} and {%Sāraṇa%} came as spies and were seized by {%Vibhīṣaṇa%},
but dismissed by {%Rāma. Rāma%} then sent {%Aṅgada%} as his
envoy to {%Rāvaṇa%} (III, {@283@}).
