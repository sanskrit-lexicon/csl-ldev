[{@Āśramavāsaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
dwelling in the hermitage”), the 95th of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr. (cf. Āśramavāsa). § 787: Asked by Janamejaya
how the Pāṇḍavas, having acquired their kingdom, conducted
themselves towards {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, how Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
{%Gāndhārī%} behaved, and for how many years his grandfather
ruled the kingdom, Vaiśampāyana said: The Pāṇḍavas ruled,
placing Dhṛtarāṣṭra at their head; {%Vidura, Sañjaya%}, and
{%Yuyutsu%} used to wait upon Dhṛtarāṣṭra; for 15 years
they did all things under the advice of the old king; {%Kuntī%}
obeyed Gāndhūrī; {%Draupadī%} and {%Subhadrā%}, etc., showed
the utmost respect for the old king and his queen; the
Pāṇḍavas surrounded the old king and his queen with every
luxury, and Maireya wines, etc. {%Kṛpa%} waited upon Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra; {%Vyāsa%} frequently visited him and recited histories
of old Ṛ., celestial ascetics, P., and Rā.; Vidura, under the
orders of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, superintended religion and law;
through his policy the Pāṇḍavas obtained numerous services
from their feudatories and followers; Dhṛtarāṣṭra liberated
prisoners and pardoned those condemned to death; the old
king, on his pleasure excursions, was supplied with everything
by Yudhiṣṭhira; the kings who came to Hāstinapura waited
upon Dhṛtarāṣṭra as before; Kuntī, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), served Gāndhārī
like maidservants; {%Bhīmasena%} alone did not forget his
grievances (XV, {@1@}); Dhṛtarāṣṭra was honoured by Ṛ., and
used to make gifts to the brahmans in rites for P. and {%śrāddhas%}
for his sons, etc.; Dhṛtarāṣṭra also felt great affection for the
Pāṇḍavas, and so did Gāndhārī; Gāndhārī performed śrāddhas
with gifts; grieved at the remembrance of Duryodhana,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra every morning blessed the Pāṇḍavas, wishing
them victory in battle, etc. Yudhiṣṭhira became very much
liked by all the four castes, and forgot the wrongs inflicted
upon him by Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons; from fear of Yudhiṣṭhira
nobody dared to speak evil of Duryodhana or Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
Bhīma, however, reverenced the old king outwardly, with
a very unwilling heart (XV, {@2@}). While there was no variance
in the cordiality between Yudhiṣṭhira and Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
the latter could not but feel unfriendly towards Bhīma,
and Bhīma, recollecting his foes Duryodhana, Karṇa, and
Duḥśāsana, indulged in boastful language about Duryodhana
and his brothers whom he had slain. Gāndhārī was not
moved. After 15 years Dhṛtarāṣṭra, afflicted by the wordy
darts of Bhīma, became penetrated with despair and grief;
Yudhiṣṭhira, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), did not know it. Dhṛtarāṣṭra opened
his heart to his friends (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); now he was observing a vow
of fast, which he had concealed from Yudhiṣṭhira, lying
on the earth clad in deerskin; Gāndhārī observed similar
vows; now he asked Yudhiṣṭhira's permission for himself
and Gāndhārī to retire into the woods clad in rags and bark
in order to practise austerities. Yudhiṣṭhira lamented (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>)
(“Let Yuyutsu be made king; I shall go into the woods”);
but Dhṛtarāṣṭra's resolution remains unaltered; he asked
Sañjaya and Kṛpa to speak for him to Yudhiṣṭhira; leaning
on Gāndhārī he looked like one deprived of life; Yudhiṣṭhira
lamented (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), and gently rubbed Dhṛtarāṣṭra's breast and face
with cold water and revived him by the touch of his hand,
on which were jewels and medicinal herbs. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
said that the touch of Yudhiṣṭhira was highly gratifying,
embraced him, and smelt his head; Vidura, Kuntī, etc.,
wept; Gāndhārī bore her sorrow with fortitude. Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra renewed his request; Vyāsa came (XV, {@3@}) and asked
[Page006-a+ 63]
Yudhiṣṭhira to permit Dhṛtarāṣṭra to follow the path of all
the ancient R.-ṛ.; “Gāndhārī bears her grief with fortitude.”
Yudhiṣṭhira yielded to Vyāsa's intercession; Vyāsa summed
ap the reasons for Dhṛtarāṣṭra's retirement (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), and then
proceeded to the woods. Yudhiṣṭhira then said that he
would conform to the advice of Vyāsa, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>) (XV, {@4@});
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>), entering the palace of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, ate a little. Then Dhṛtarāṣṭra gave Yudhiṣ-
ṭhira advice about how the latter should rule his kingdom (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>)
(XV, {@5@}). Continuation (XV, {@6@}). Continuation; agreeably
to the science known to Uśanas, [arrays called] Śakaṭa,
Padma, and Vajra should be formed; “thou hast been
instructed in all duties by Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa, and Vidura”;
100 horse-sacrifices and righteous rule are productive of equal
merit (XV, {@7@}). Yudhiṣṭhira gratefully accepted his instruc-
tions, as Bhīṣma, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), no longer were there to instruct
him. Dhṛtarāṣṭra wishes to depart soon, and Gāndhārī
reminded him that he has got the permission of Vyāsa, and
asks him when he would go to the forest with the permission of
Yudhiṣṭhira; he wished first to make gifts for the advance-
ment in the other world of his dead sons and other kinsmen
(who were now {%pretas%}), and assembled all the subjects, while
Yudhiṣṭhira brought all the articles necessary; Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
in a touching address, took leave of that large concourse of
men of all the four castes (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>) (XV, {@8@}), recapitulating the history
of the realm from Śāntanu downwards (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>) (XV, {@9@}). The
citizens were exceedingly agitated upon hearing Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra's address; they charged the learned brahman Śāmba
(B. Sāmba) with answering him (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>): “King Duryodhana
never did us any wrong; we were well protected and ruled
by him; we have also enjoyed great happiness for thousands
of years under Yudhiṣṭhira, who follows the conduct of the
R.-ṛ. of old (Kuru, Saṃvaraṇa, Bharata, etc.); the carnage on
the field of Kurukṣetra was not brought about by Duryo-
dhana, Karṇa, and Śakuni, nor by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, but by
Destiny, which in 18 days caused 18 {%akṣauhiṇīs%} to be
destroyed by Bhīṣma, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>); the Pāṇḍavas are capable
of ruling without either thee or ourselves to look after them;
Kuntī, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), will not do the least wrong to the people.”
Then Dhṛtarāṣṭra slowly dismissed the assembly, and entered
his house with Gāndhārī (XV, {@10@}). After that night had
passed away, Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent Vidura to Yudhiṣṭhira in
order to announce that he would set out for the woods on the
coming day of the full moon in the month of Kārttika, and
to solicit some wealth for performing the {%śrāddha%} of Bhīṣma,
etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>). Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna applauded his words;
Bhīma was unwilling, recollecting Duryodhana; Arjuna
sought to pacify him, applauded by Yudhiṣṭhira; Bhīmasena
maintained that gifts for Bhīṣma, etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>), should be given by
them, and by Kuntī for Karṇa; “Let Duryodhana, etc., sink
from a miserable to a more miserable position,” reminding his
brothers of the woes and disgrace inflicted upon them by those
for whose benefit Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked for wealth (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>). Yudhiṣ-
ṭhira rebuked him (XV, {@11@}). Arjuna urged Bhīma to forget
the injuries. Yudhiṣṭhira said to Vidura that he would give
Dhṛtarāṣṭra so much wealth as he wished for the obsequies
of his sons and Bhīṣma, etc., and asked him to tell Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra not to be angry with Bhīmasena (XV, {@12@}). Vidura
reported the speeches of Yudhiṣṭhira, Arjuna, and Bhīma to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Dhṛtarāṣṭra expressed his satisfaction, and
set his heart on making large presents on the day of full
moon in the month of Kārttika (XV, {@13@}). Dhṛtarāṣṭra
invited thousands of deserving brahmans [and] superior Ṛ.
[Page006-b+ 63]
for Bhīṣma, etc.; and made large gifts to them, naming
Droṇa, etc. (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>); tellers and scribes appointed by Yudhiṣṭhira
ceaselessly ask the old king as to what should be given to
each recipient that presented himself; unto him that was to
receive 100 a 1000 were given, and he who was to receive
1000 was presented with 10,000 at the command of
Yudhiṣṭhira; this was given by Dhṛtarāṣṭra for the benefit
in the other world of his sons and grandsons, as also of
himself and Gāndhārī; the donation lasted for 10 days
(XV, {@14@}). On the day of full moon in the month of Kārttika
Dhṛtarāṣṭra (and Gāṅdhārī) summoned the Pāṇḍavas, caused
the rites to be performed, and his sacred fire to be taken up,
put on deerskins and bark, and set out with his daughters-
in-law. The ladies uttered loud wails; Yudhiṣṭhira and
Arjuna were pierced with grief; Bhīmasena, etc. (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>), all
followed Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Kuntī held on her shoulders the
hand of Gāndhārī, who walked with her bandaged eyes;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra walked behind Gāndhārī, placing his hand on
her shoulder; Kṛṣṇā, etc. (<lang n="greek">υ</lang>), all-proceeded with Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra; the citizens of all orders were as distressed as they
had been at the departure of the Pāṇḍavas after the match
of dice († 431—440) (XV, {@15@}); Dhṛtarāṣṭra left the city
through the principal gate, and then asked those who
followed him to desist. Vidura and Sañjaya retired with him
into the woods; Kṛpa and Yuyutsu he caused to remain,
and made them over to Yudhiṣṭhira. Kuntī retired with
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, though Yudhiṣṭhira sought to dissuade her;
she said: “Never show any disregard for Sahadeva: he is
very much attached to me, and to thee also”; then she
reminded him of Karṇa, etc. (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>); Yudhiṣṭhira reminded her
that she had herself formerly recited to them the story of
Vidulā, when they were about to set out from the town, and
that they had won sovereignty guided by her words com-
municated through Kṛṣṇa. Also Bhīma dissuaded her,
pointing out the grief of the sons of Mādrī; but in vain.
Draupadī and Subhadrā followed her, and so did the Pāṇḍavas
with all their wives and attendants; Kuntī addressed
them (XV, {@16@}), assigning her reasons for her conduct
(<lang n="greek">χ</lang>) (XV, {@17@}). The Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī then desisted
from following her. The Pāṇḍavas circumambulated Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, etc., for taking their leave to return. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
(with Gāndhārī and Vidura) made a final effort of dis-
suading Kuntī from retiring into the forest with him, but
in vain. The ladies set up a loud wail of grief. Hāstinapura
became plunged into sorrow: no festivals were observed.
The Pāṇḍavas were without any energy. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
arrived on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī and took rest
there for the night among the brahmans, who there, like
himself, ignited their sacred fires; arrangement of the beds
of Vidura, etc. (<lang n="greek">ψ</lang>); the Yājaka brahmans, etc., of the king
laid themselves down on their respective beds; that night
seemed as delightful to them as a Brāhmī night. When the
night had passed away Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., going through their
morning acts and rites, continue their journey (XV, {@18@}).
Following the advice of Vidura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra took up his
abode on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī; many of the four orders
came to see him; he gladdened them all by his words. At
evening Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc. (<lang n="greek">ω</lang>), bathed in the stream, etc.;
Kuntī led him and Gāndhārī. Then he proceeded to
Kurukṣetra to the retreat of R.-ṛ. Śatayūpa ({%b%}), who received
him with due rites; accompanied by him he proceeded to the
retreat of Vyāsa, where he received the initiation [into the
forest life]; after having returned he took up his abode in
[Page007-a+ 63]
the retreat of Śatayūpa, who instructed him in all the rites
of the forest mode of life, at the command of Vyāsa. Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, etc. (<lang n="greek">αα</lang>), began to practise austerities (XV, {@19@}).
Ṛ. Nārada, etc. (<lang n="greek">ββ</lang>), came there and gladdened Dhṛtarāṣṭra
with discourses on religion. Ṛ. Nārada mentioned the kings
that attained to heaven after practising penances in that very
retreat (<lang n="greek">γγ</lang>): Sahasracitya, Śailālaya, Pṛṣadhra, Purukutsa,
Śaśaloman; “Thou also wilt, with Gāndhārī, through the
grace of Vyāsa, attain to a very high goal; dwelling in the
presence of Indra, Pāṇḍu always thinks of thee, and will
assist thee in the attainment of prosperity; Kuntī, by serving
thee and Gāndhārī, will obtain residence with her husband
in the other world; we behold all this with our spiritual
vision; Vidura will enter into Yudhiṣṭhira; Sañjaya will
ascend to Heaven.” Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., praised Nārada.
Śatayūpa asked Nārada what regions ({%lokāḥ%}) will be acquired
by Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Nārada said: On a visit to Indra I saw
Pāṇḍu; Indra said that after three years Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
Gāndhārī would go to the abode of Kubera, on a car moving at
will, and he would rove through the regions of D., G., and Rā.;
this is a mystery of the gods. All the persons present (as
also Dhṛtarāṣṭra) became highly pleased. Then they went
away by the path of the Siddhas (XV, {@20@}).—§ 788: The
anxiety of the Pāṇḍavas and citizens about the fate of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, etc., and their despair when they reflected on that
terrible slaughter of their kinsmen (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); only Parikṣit
somehow consoled them (XV, {@21@}); afflicted with grief, they
failed to derive pleasure from anything, nor did they attend
to their kingly offices, thinking of Kuntī and Gāndhārī.
They set their heart upon seeing Dhṛtarāṣṭra in his forest
retreat. Sahadeva, lamenting the fate of Kuntī, and ex-
pressing his longing to see her, proposed a visit to the woods,
supported by Draupadī, who mentioned Kuntī and Gāndhārī
and Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Yudhiṣṭhira caused his army to be
equipped, ordered litters, etc., for the ladies, and proclaimed
that they would march out to-morrow, permitting the citizens
to follow them. The next morning they set out, then waited
five days for such citizens as would accompany them, and
then proceeded towards the forest (XV, {@22@}), headed by Arjuna
(on a car with white horses) and Kṛpa (description of the
expedition); Bhīma on a gigantic elephant, the twins on
two fleet steeds, the ladies in closed litters, scattering showers
of wealth as they proceeded, headed by Draupadī. They
proceeded slowly. Yuyutsu and Dhaumya protected the
city. They reached Kurukṣetra, crossed the Yamunā, and
approached the retreat of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (XV, {@23@}). The
Pāṇḍavas and their followers, alighting from their cars, walked
on foot; the ascetics told them that Dhṛtarāṣṭra had gone to
the Yamunā for his ablutions, etc., and pointed out the way
to them. Sahadeva ran with speed towards Kuntī; they
both wept; she informed Gāndhārī, and then advanced
towards Yudhiṣṭhira, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), dragging the childless old
couple; the Pāṇḍavas fell down at their feet, and took from
their hands the jars of water they were carrying. Yudhi-
ṣṭhira presented all his followers one after another to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, mentioning their names and races. Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra rejoiced and went to his retreat that was applauded
by Si. and Cā. (XV, {@24@}). To the ascetics, who had come from
various regions in order to see the Pāṇḍavas, Sañjaya pointed
out each of them (†<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); then Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked († v. 660—674)
(XV, {@25@}) Yudhiṣṭhira about the welfare of the Pāṇḍavas
and their devotion to P. and D.; Yudhiṣṭhira answered,
enquiring after Vidura, who turned out to be engaged in
[Page007-b+ 63]
penances, subsisting on air alone, and was now seen at
a distance with matted locks, and gravel in his mouth, and
exceedingly emaciated, naked, and besmeared with filth and
dust; Vidura fled, pursued by Yudhiṣṭhira; at last he stood
motionless in {%yoga%}, and entered the body of Yudhiṣṭhira,
who felt that he had become stronger than before and had
acquired many additional virtues and accomplishments, and
recollected his own state before his birth among men; he
had heard of {%yoga%}-practice from Vyāsa. He desired to
cremate the lifeless body of Vidura, but was prevented by an
invisible voice which said, that in Vidura (who was Dharma)
was Yudhiṣṭhira's body also, and that Vidura would attain
to the regions ({%lokāḥ%}) called Santānikāḥ. Yudhiṣṭhira came
and informed Dhṛtarāṣṭra; all became filled with wonder.
They passed that night under a tree (XV, {@26@}), conversing on
morality and wealth. The next morning they surveyed the
retreat (description) and the other retreats in the forest.
Yudhiṣṭhira made presents to the ascetics (specification);
then he returned to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>); many M.-ṛ.
(Śatayūpa, etc.) who dwelt in Kurukṣetra came there, as
also Vyāsa (XV, {@27@}), who enquired after Dhṛtarāṣṭra's, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), welfare, and told them who Vidura was, mentioning the
curse of Dharma by Māṇḍavya (with an expenditure of his
penances); he was superior to Bṛhaspati and Śukra; and
how Vyāsa had procreated him upon the soil of Vicitravīrya;
he was Dharma in consequence of his practices of {%dhāraṇā%}
and {%dhyāna%}; from Dharma also Yudhiṣṭhira took his birth.
Vyāsa says that he has come to show a wonderful effect of
his own penances: “what dost thou wish to see, or ask, or
hear?” (XV, {@28@}).
