[{@Āśramavāsaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">dwelling in the hermitage”), the 95th of the minor parvans
<div n="lb">of Mhbhr. (cf. Āśramavāsa). § 787: Asked by Janamejaya
<div n="lb">how the Pāṇḍavas, having acquired their kingdom, conducted
<div n="lb">themselves towards {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} how Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī%} behaved, and for how many years his grandfather
<div n="lb">ruled the kingdom, Vaiśampāyana said: The Pāṇḍavas ruled,
<div n="lb">placing Dhṛtarāṣṭra at their head; {%Vidura, Sañjaya,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Yuyutsu%} used to wait upon Dhṛtarāṣṭra; for 15 years
<div n="lb">they did all things under the advice of the old king; {%Kuntī%}
<div n="lb">obeyed Gāndhūrī; {%Draupadī%} and {%Subhadrā,%} etc., showed
<div n="lb">the utmost respect for the old king and his queen; the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas surrounded the old king and his queen with every
<div n="lb">luxury, and Maireya wines, etc. {%Kṛpa%} waited upon Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra; {%Vyāsa%} frequently visited him and recited histories
<div n="lb">of old Ṛ., celestial ascetics, P., and Rā.; Vidura, under the
<div n="lb">orders of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, superintended religion and law;
<div n="lb">through his policy the Pāṇḍavas obtained numerous services
<div n="lb">from their feudatories and followers; Dhṛtarāṣṭra liberated
<div n="lb">prisoners and pardoned those condemned to death; the old
<div n="lb">king, on his pleasure excursions, was supplied with everything
<div n="lb">by Yudhiṣṭhira; the kings who came to Hāstinapura waited
<div n="lb">upon Dhṛtarāṣṭra as before; Kuntī, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), served Gāndhārī
<div n="lb">like maidservants; {%Bhīmasena%} alone did not forget his
<div n="lb">grievances (XV, {@1@}); Dhṛtarāṣṭra was honoured by Ṛ., and
<div n="lb">used to make gifts to the brahmans in rites for P. and {%śrāddhas%}
<div n="lb">for his sons, etc.; Dhṛtarāṣṭra also felt great affection for the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas, and so did Gāndhārī; Gāndhārī performed śrāddhas
<div n="lb">with gifts; grieved at the remembrance of Duryodhana,
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra every morning blessed the Pāṇḍavas, wishing
<div n="lb">them victory in battle, etc. Yudhiṣṭhira became very much
<div n="lb">liked by all the four castes, and forgot the wrongs inflicted
<div n="lb">upon him by Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons; from fear of Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">nobody dared to speak evil of Duryodhana or Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
<div n="lb">Bhīma, however, reverenced the old king outwardly, with
<div n="lb">a very unwilling heart (XV, {@2@}). While there was no variance
<div n="lb">in the cordiality between Yudhiṣṭhira and Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb">the latter could not but feel unfriendly towards Bhīma,
<div n="lb">and Bhīma, recollecting his foes Duryodhana, Karṇa, and
<div n="lb">Duḥśāsana, indulged in boastful language about Duryodhana
<div n="lb">and his brothers whom he had slain. Gāndhārī was not
<div n="lb">moved. After 15 years Dhṛtarāṣṭra, afflicted by the wordy
<div n="lb">darts of Bhīma, became penetrated with despair and grief;
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), did not know it. Dhṛtarāṣṭra opened
<div n="lb">his heart to his friends (<lang n="greek"></lang>); now he was observing a vow
<div n="lb">of fast, which he had concealed from Yudhiṣṭhira, lying
<div n="lb">on the earth clad in deerskin; Gāndhārī observed similar
<div n="lb">vows; now he asked Yudhiṣṭhira's permission for himself
<div n="lb">and Gāndhārī to retire into the woods clad in rags and bark
<div n="lb">in order to practise austerities. Yudhiṣṭhira lamented (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(“Let Yuyutsu be made king; I shall go into the woods”);
<div n="lb">but Dhṛtarāṣṭra's resolution remains unaltered; he asked
<div n="lb">Sañjaya and Kṛpa to speak for him to Yudhiṣṭhira; leaning
<div n="lb">on Gāndhārī he looked like one deprived of life; Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">lamented (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and gently rubbed Dhṛtarāṣṭra's breast and face
<div n="lb">with cold water and revived him by the touch of his hand,
<div n="lb">on which were jewels and medicinal herbs. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">said that the touch of Yudhiṣṭhira was highly gratifying,
<div n="lb">embraced him, and smelt his head; Vidura, Kuntī, etc.,
<div n="lb">wept; Gāndhārī bore her sorrow with fortitude. Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra renewed his request; Vyāsa came (XV, {@3@}) and asked
[Page006-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira to permit Dhṛtarāṣṭra to follow the path of all
<div n="lb">the ancient R.-ṛ.; “Gāndhārī bears her grief with fortitude.”
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira yielded to Vyāsa's intercession; Vyāsa summed
<div n="lb">ap the reasons for Dhṛtarāṣṭra's retirement (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and then
<div n="lb">proceeded to the woods. Yudhiṣṭhira then said that he
<div n="lb">would conform to the advice of Vyāsa, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XV, {@4@});
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), entering the palace of
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra, ate a little. Then Dhṛtarāṣṭra gave Yudhiṣ-
<div n="lb">ṭhira advice about how the latter should rule his kingdom (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(XV, {@5@}). Continuation (XV, {@6@}). Continuation; agreeably
<div n="lb">to the science known to Uśanas, [arrays called] Śakaṭa,
<div n="lb">Padma, and Vajra should be formed; “thou hast been
<div n="lb">instructed in all duties by Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa, and Vidura”;
<div n="lb">100 horse-sacrifices and righteous rule are productive of equal
<div n="lb">merit (XV, {@7@}). Yudhiṣṭhira gratefully accepted his instruc-
<div n="lb">tions, as Bhīṣma, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), no longer were there to instruct
<div n="lb">him. Dhṛtarāṣṭra wishes to depart soon, and Gāndhārī
<div n="lb">reminded him that he has got the permission of Vyāsa, and
<div n="lb">asks him when he would go to the forest with the permission of
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira; he wished first to make gifts for the advance-
<div n="lb">ment in the other world of his dead sons and other kinsmen
<div n="lb">(who were now {%pretas%}), and assembled all the subjects, while
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira brought all the articles necessary; Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
<div n="lb">in a touching address, took leave of that large concourse of
<div n="lb">men of all the four castes (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XV, {@8@}), recapitulating the history
<div n="lb">of the realm from Śāntanu downwards (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XV, {@9@}). The
<div n="lb">citizens were exceedingly agitated upon hearing Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra's address; they charged the learned brahman Śāmba
<div n="lb">(B. Sāmba) with answering him (<lang n="greek"></lang>): “King Duryodhana
<div n="lb">never did us any wrong; we were well protected and ruled
<div n="lb">by him; we have also enjoyed great happiness for thousands
<div n="lb">of years under Yudhiṣṭhira, who follows the conduct of the
<div n="lb">R.-ṛ. of old (Kuru, Saṃvaraṇa, Bharata, etc.); the carnage on
<div n="lb">the field of Kurukṣetra was not brought about by Duryo-
<div n="lb">dhana, Karṇa, and Śakuni, nor by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, but by
<div n="lb">Destiny, which in 18 days caused 18 {%akṣauhiṇīs%} to be
<div n="lb">destroyed by Bhīṣma, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the Pāṇḍavas are capable
<div n="lb">of ruling without either thee or ourselves to look after them;
<div n="lb">Kuntī, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), will not do the least wrong to the people.”
<div n="lb">Then Dhṛtarāṣṭra slowly dismissed the assembly, and entered
<div n="lb">his house with Gāndhārī (XV, {@10@}). After that night had
<div n="lb">passed away, Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent Vidura to Yudhiṣṭhira in
<div n="lb">order to announce that he would set out for the woods on the
<div n="lb">coming day of the full moon in the month of Kārttika, and
<div n="lb">to solicit some wealth for performing the {%śrāddha%} of Bhīṣma,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna applauded his words;
<div n="lb">Bhīma was unwilling, recollecting Duryodhana; Arjuna
<div n="lb">sought to pacify him, applauded by Yudhiṣṭhira; Bhīmasena
<div n="lb">maintained that gifts for Bhīṣma, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), should be given by
<div n="lb">them, and by Kuntī for Karṇa; “Let Duryodhana, etc., sink
<div n="lb">from a miserable to a more miserable position,” reminding his
<div n="lb">brothers of the woes and disgrace inflicted upon them by those
<div n="lb">for whose benefit Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked for wealth (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Yudhiṣ-
<div n="lb">ṭhira rebuked him (XV, {@11@}). Arjuna urged Bhīma to forget
<div n="lb">the injuries. Yudhiṣṭhira said to Vidura that he would give
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra so much wealth as he wished for the obsequies
<div n="lb">of his sons and Bhīṣma, etc., and asked him to tell Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra not to be angry with Bhīmasena (XV, {@12@}). Vidura
<div n="lb">reported the speeches of Yudhiṣṭhira, Arjuna, and Bhīma to
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Dhṛtarāṣṭra expressed his satisfaction, and
<div n="lb">set his heart on making large presents on the day of full
<div n="lb">moon in the month of Kārttika (XV, {@13@}). Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">invited thousands of deserving brahmans [and] superior Ṛ.
[Page006-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">for Bhīṣma, etc.; and made large gifts to them, naming
<div n="lb">Droṇa, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); tellers and scribes appointed by Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb">ceaselessly ask the old king as to what should be given to
<div n="lb">each recipient that presented himself; unto him that was to
<div n="lb">receive 100 a 1000 were given, and he who was to receive
<div n="lb">1000 was presented with 10,000 at the command of
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira; this was given by Dhṛtarāṣṭra for the benefit
<div n="lb">in the other world of his sons and grandsons, as also of
<div n="lb">himself and Gāndhārī; the donation lasted for 10 days
<div n="lb">(XV, {@14@}). On the day of full moon in the month of Kārttika
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra (and Gāṅdhārī) summoned the Pāṇḍavas, caused
<div n="lb">the rites to be performed, and his sacred fire to be taken up,
<div n="lb">put on deerskins and bark, and set out with his daughters-
<div n="lb">in-law. The ladies uttered loud wails; Yudhiṣṭhira and
<div n="lb">Arjuna were pierced with grief; Bhīmasena, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), all
<div n="lb">followed Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Kuntī held on her shoulders the
<div n="lb">hand of Gāndhārī, who walked with her bandaged eyes;
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra walked behind Gāndhārī, placing his hand on
<div n="lb">her shoulder; Kṛṣṇā, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), all-proceeded with Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra; the citizens of all orders were as distressed as they
<div n="lb">had been at the departure of the Pāṇḍavas after the match
<div n="lb">of dice († 431—440) (XV, {@15@}); Dhṛtarāṣṭra left the city
<div n="lb">through the principal gate, and then asked those who
<div n="lb">followed him to desist. Vidura and Sañjaya retired with him
<div n="lb">into the woods; Kṛpa and Yuyutsu he caused to remain,
<div n="lb">and made them over to Yudhiṣṭhira. Kuntī retired with
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra, though Yudhiṣṭhira sought to dissuade her;
<div n="lb">she said: “Never show any disregard for Sahadeva: he is
<div n="lb">very much attached to me, and to thee also”; then she
<div n="lb">reminded him of Karṇa, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); Yudhiṣṭhira reminded her
<div n="lb">that she had herself formerly recited to them the story of
<div n="lb">Vidulā, when they were about to set out from the town, and
<div n="lb">that they had won sovereignty guided by her words com-
<div n="lb">municated through Kṛṣṇa. Also Bhīma dissuaded her,
<div n="lb">pointing out the grief of the sons of Mādrī; but in vain.
<div n="lb">Draupadī and Subhadrā followed her, and so did the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">with all their wives and attendants; Kuntī addressed
<div n="lb">them (XV, {@16@}), assigning her reasons for her conduct
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XV, {@17@}). The Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī then desisted
<div n="lb">from following her. The Pāṇḍavas circumambulated Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra, etc., for taking their leave to return. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">(with Gāndhārī and Vidura) made a final effort of dis-
<div n="lb">suading Kuntī from retiring into the forest with him, but
<div n="lb">in vain. The ladies set up a loud wail of grief. Hāstinapura
<div n="lb">became plunged into sorrow: no festivals were observed.
<div n="lb">The Pāṇḍavas were without any energy. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">arrived on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī and took rest
<div n="lb">there for the night among the brahmans, who there, like
<div n="lb">himself, ignited their sacred fires; arrangement of the beds
<div n="lb">of Vidura, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the Yājaka brahmans, etc., of the king
<div n="lb">laid themselves down on their respective beds; that night
<div n="lb">seemed as delightful to them as a Brāhmī night. When the
<div n="lb">night had passed away Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., going through their
<div n="lb">morning acts and rites, continue their journey (XV, {@18@}).
<div n="lb">Following the advice of Vidura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra took up his
<div n="lb">abode on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī; many of the four orders
<div n="lb">came to see him; he gladdened them all by his words. At
<div n="lb">evening Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), bathed in the stream, etc.;
<div n="lb">Kuntī led him and Gāndhārī. Then he proceeded to
<div n="lb">Kurukṣetra to the retreat of R.-ṛ. Śatayūpa (<lang n="greek"></lang>), who received
<div n="lb">him with due rites; accompanied by him he proceeded to the
<div n="lb">retreat of Vyāsa, where he received the initiation [into the
<div n="lb">forest life]; after having returned he took up his abode in
[Page007-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the retreat of Śatayūpa, who instructed him in all the rites
<div n="lb">of the forest mode of life, at the command of Vyāsa. Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), began to practise austerities (XV, {@19@}).
<div n="lb">Ṛ. Nārada, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came there and gladdened Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">with discourses on religion. Ṛ. Nārada mentioned the kings
<div n="lb">that attained to heaven after practising penances in that very
<div n="lb">retreat (<lang n="greek"></lang>): Sahasracitya, Śailālaya, Pṛṣadhra, Purukutsa,
<div n="lb">Śaśaloman; “Thou also wilt, with Gāndhārī, through the
<div n="lb">grace of Vyāsa, attain to a very high goal; dwelling in the
<div n="lb">presence of Indra, Pāṇḍu always thinks of thee, and will
<div n="lb">assist thee in the attainment of prosperity; Kuntī, by serving
<div n="lb">thee and Gāndhārī, will obtain residence with her husband
<div n="lb">in the other world; we behold all this with our spiritual
<div n="lb">vision; Vidura will enter into Yudhiṣṭhira; Sañjaya will
<div n="lb">ascend to Heaven.” Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., praised Nārada.
<div n="lb">Śatayūpa asked Nārada what regions {%(lokāḥ)%} will be acquired
<div n="lb">by Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Nārada said: On a visit to Indra I saw
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍu; Indra said that after three years Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
<div n="lb">Gāndhārī would go to the abode of Kubera, on a car moving at
<div n="lb">will, and he would rove through the regions of D., G., and Rā.;
<div n="lb">this is a mystery of the gods. All the persons present (as
<div n="lb">also Dhṛtarāṣṭra) became highly pleased. Then they went
<div n="lb">away by the path of the Siddhas (XV, {@20@}).—§ 788: The
<div n="lb">anxiety of the Pāṇḍavas and citizens about the fate of Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra, etc., and their despair when they reflected on that
<div n="lb">terrible slaughter of their kinsmen (<lang n="greek"></lang>); only Parikṣit
<div n="lb">somehow consoled them (XV, {@21@}); afflicted with grief, they
<div n="lb">failed to derive pleasure from anything, nor did they attend
<div n="lb">to their kingly offices, thinking of Kuntī and Gāndhārī.
<div n="lb">They set their heart upon seeing Dhṛtarāṣṭra in his forest
<div n="lb">retreat. Sahadeva, lamenting the fate of Kuntī, and ex-
<div n="lb">pressing his longing to see her, proposed a visit to the woods,
<div n="lb">supported by Draupadī, who mentioned Kuntī and Gāndhārī
<div n="lb">and Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Yudhiṣṭhira caused his army to be
<div n="lb">equipped, ordered litters, etc., for the ladies, and proclaimed
<div n="lb">that they would march out to-morrow, permitting the citizens
<div n="lb">to follow them. The next morning they set out, then waited
<div n="lb">five days for such citizens as would accompany them, and
<div n="lb">then proceeded towards the forest (XV, {@22@}), headed by Arjuna
<div n="lb">(on a car with white horses) and Kṛpa (description of the
<div n="lb">expedition); Bhīma on a gigantic elephant, the twins on
<div n="lb">two fleet steeds, the ladies in closed litters, scattering showers
<div n="lb">of wealth as they proceeded, headed by Draupadī. They
<div n="lb">proceeded slowly. Yuyutsu and Dhaumya protected the
<div n="lb">city. They reached Kurukṣetra, crossed the Yamunā, and
<div n="lb">approached the retreat of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (XV, {@23@}). The
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas and their followers, alighting from their cars, walked
<div n="lb">on foot; the ascetics told them that Dhṛtarāṣṭra had gone to
<div n="lb">the Yamunā for his ablutions, etc., and pointed out the way
<div n="lb">to them. Sahadeva ran with speed towards Kuntī; they
<div n="lb">both wept; she informed Gāndhārī, and then advanced
<div n="lb">towards Yudhiṣṭhira, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), dragging the childless old
<div n="lb">couple; the Pāṇḍavas fell down at their feet, and took from
<div n="lb">their hands the jars of water they were carrying. Yudhi-
<div n="lb">ṣṭhira presented all his followers one after another to
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra, mentioning their names and races. Dhṛta-
<div n="lb">rāṣṭra rejoiced and went to his retreat that was applauded
<div n="lb">by Si. and Cā. (XV, {@24@}). To the ascetics, who had come from
<div n="lb">various regions in order to see the Pāṇḍavas, Sañjaya pointed
<div n="lb">out each of them (†<lang n="greek"></lang>); then Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked († v. 660—674)
<div n="lb">(XV, {@25@}) Yudhiṣṭhira about the welfare of the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">and their devotion to P. and D.; Yudhiṣṭhira answered,
<div n="lb">enquiring after Vidura, who turned out to be engaged in
[Page007-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">penances, subsisting on air alone, and was now seen at
<div n="lb">a distance with matted locks, and gravel in his mouth, and
<div n="lb">exceedingly emaciated, naked, and besmeared with filth and
<div n="lb">dust; Vidura fled, pursued by Yudhiṣṭhira; at last he stood
<div n="lb">motionless in {%yoga,%} and entered the body of Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb">who felt that he had become stronger than before and had
<div n="lb">acquired many additional virtues and accomplishments, and
<div n="lb">recollected his own state before his birth among men; he
<div n="lb">had heard of {%yoga%}-practice from Vyāsa. He desired to
<div n="lb">cremate the lifeless body of Vidura, but was prevented by an
<div n="lb">invisible voice which said, that in Vidura (who was Dharma)
<div n="lb">was Yudhiṣṭhira's body also, and that Vidura would attain
<div n="lb">to the regions {%(lokāḥ)%} called Santānikāḥ. Yudhiṣṭhira came
<div n="lb">and informed Dhṛtarāṣṭra; all became filled with wonder.
<div n="lb">They passed that night under a tree (XV, {@26@}), conversing on
<div n="lb">morality and wealth. The next morning they surveyed the
<div n="lb">retreat (description) and the other retreats in the forest.
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira made presents to the ascetics (specification);
<div n="lb">then he returned to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); many M.-ṛ.
<div n="lb">(Śatayūpa, etc.) who dwelt in Kurukṣetra came there, as
<div n="lb">also Vyāsa (XV, {@27@}), who enquired after Dhṛtarāṣṭra's, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), welfare, and told them who Vidura was, mentioning the
<div n="lb">curse of Dharma by Māṇḍavya (with an expenditure of his
<div n="lb">penances); he was superior to Bṛhaspati and Śukra; and
<div n="lb">how Vyāsa had procreated him upon the soil of Vicitravīrya;
<div n="lb">he was Dharma in consequence of his practices of {%dhāraṇā%}
<div n="lb">and {%dhyāna;%} from Dharma also Yudhiṣṭhira took his birth.
<div n="lb">Vyāsa says that he has come to show a wonderful effect of
<div n="lb">his own penances: “what dost thou wish to see, or ask, or
<div n="lb">hear?” (XV, {@28@}).
