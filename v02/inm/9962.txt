[{@Skandayuddha(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the combat of Skanda”). § 503
(cf. Manuṣyagr.). Then {%Svāhā%}, the daughter of {%Dakṣa%},
who had in vain loved {%Agni%} from her childhood, prevailed
upon {%Skanda%} that she should live for ever with {%Agni%}, in so far
as offerings with {%mantras%} to the gods and {%pitṛs (havyaṃ%}
{%kavyañ ca%}) should always be coupled with the name of {%Svāhā%}.
—§ 504. Then {%Skanda%} was sent by {%Brahmán%} to his father
{%Rudra%}; for {%Rudra%} and {%Umā%} had entered {%Agni%} and {%Svāhā%},
and from this combination {%Skanda%} had sprung; {%Rudra's%}
semen had been thrown back upon the hill, whence sprang
forth {%Miñjikā%} and {%Miñjika%}, and portions of it fell into the
Blood Sea, into the rays of the sun, upon the earth, and upon
the trees, whence sprang forth the various troops of his
{%pāriṣadas%}, living on flesh. These five classes of spirits
should be honoured with sun-flowers ({%arkapuṣpaiḥ%}: Calotropis
gigantea) for the sake of wealth and healing of diseases;
{%Miñjikā%} and {%Miñjika%} must be honoured for the welfare of
children; the females, named {%Vṛddhikās%}, who were produced
in the trees and live on human flesh, must be worshipped by
persons who desire to have children. These are the innu-
merable {%gaṇas%} of {%Piśācas%}.—§ 505. {%Airāvata%} had two bells
named {%Vaijayantī; Indra%} gave one of them to {%Viśākha%} and
the other one to {%Skanda%}; the standards of {%Skanda%} and {%Viśākha%}
were red. {%Skanda%}, surrounded by troops of {%Piśācas%} and gods,
sat on the golden mountain with the toys that had been given
to him by the gods. Description of the {%Śveta%} mountain.—
§ 506. Then {%Śiva%}, with {%Pārvatī%}, rode in their shining
chariot, yoked with 1,000 lions and managed by {%Kāla%}, to
{%Bhadravaṭa%}; they were preceded by {%Kubera%} (riding in
{%Puṣpaka%}) with the {%Guhyakas%}, and followed by {%Indra%} (riding
on {%Airāvata%}) and the gods; in the right wing of his army
was the great {%Yakṣa Amogha%}, with the {%Jṛmbhakas, Yakṣas%},
{%Rakṣases, Vasus, Rudras%}, etc.; there was also {%Yama%}, with
{%Mṛtyu%}, surrounded by hundreds of terrible diseases; behind
{%Yama%} the trident of {%Śiva%}, named {%Vijaya%}, surrounded by
{%Varuṇa%}, with various aquatic animals; the {%paṭṭiśa%} of {%Rudra%}
surrounded by clubs, etc., and followed by the umbrella of
{%Rudra%}, and after this the water-vessel, worshipped by the
troops and maharṣis, and on the right side of this the
sceptre ({%daṇḍaḥ%}), with {%Bhṛgus, Aṅgirases%}, and gods. Behind
these rode {%Rudra%} in his white chariot, followed by rivers, etc.;
{%Apsarases, nakṣatras%}, planets, the children of the gods, etc.,
and {%Parjanya. Soma%} held a white umbrella over his head,
and {%Agni%} and {%Vāyu%} held the two fans. Behind him came
{%Indra%} and the {%rājarṣis%}, and {%Gaurī, Vidyā%}, etc., and the
[Page643-b+ 63]
sciences ({%vidyāgaṇāḥ%}). In the front the {%Rākṣasa graha%}
advanced, holding the standard. The foremost of {%Yakṣas%},
{%Piṅgala%}, the friend of {%Rudra%}, who is always busy in places
where corpses are burned, at one time was ahead of the army
and at another behind it. {%Rudra%} is worshipped by mortals
with virtuous actions in various forms. At the request of
{%Śiva, Skanda%} took the command of the seventh army corps
({%skandhasya%}) and was advised always to look up to {%Śiva%}, then
he should attain great welfare.—§ 507. Omens frightened
{%Śiva, Pārvatī%}, the gods, and the {%Dānavas (Asuras, Daityas%});
{%Indra%} encouraged the gods when about to flee; the {%Dānava%}
{%Mahiṣa%} crushed 10,000 of the gods with a mountain, put
{%Indra%} and the gods to flight, and seized the pole of {%Rudra's%}
chariot, while heaven and earth groaned, etc., and the
{%maharṣis%} lost their senses, but (as {%Rudra%} did not choose to
kill him himself) {%Skanda%} killed him, cutting off his head that
barred the entrance of sixteen {%yojanas%} [to the {%Uttara-Kurus%},
Nīl.], though the {%Uttara-Kurus%} at present pass easily by that
gate. The {%Dānavas%} fell in large numbers from the lance and
arrows of {%Skanda%}; the lance always returned to his hand
again after killing thousands of enemies; the {%pāriṣadas%} of
{%Skanda%} devoured them and drank their blood. When the
{%Dānavas%} were defeated, {%Skanda%} went to {%Śiva%} and was embraced
and praised by {%Indra%}. Then {%Indra%}, with the gods, took
leave from {%Śiva%} and left the place, and {%Rudra%} returned to
{%Bhadravaṭa%}, after having recommended to the gods to render
allegiance to {%Skanda%} just as to himself. In one day {%Skanda%}
had killed the {%Dānavas%} and conqucred the three worlds*
(ch. {@231@}).
