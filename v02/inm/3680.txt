[{@Droṇābhiṣekaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">inauguration of Droṇa,” the 71st of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.; cf. Droṇābhiṣecana). § 589: {%Janamejaya%} enquired
<div n="lb">of the state of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} on the receipt of intelligence
<div n="lb">of {%Bhīṣma's%} death. {%Vaiśampāyana's%} answer: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">asked {%Sañjaya%} about what the {%Kauravas%} did after the fall of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma. Sañjaya%} mentioned the arrow-pillow, etc. (cf.
<div n="lb">§ 587 foll.), and that the warriors once more went to battle.
<div n="lb">The {%Kurus%} desired to make {%Karṇa%} their generalissimo
<div n="lb">(mentioning his enmity with {%Bhīṣma%}) (VII, {@1@}). {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">eulogised {%Bhīṣma,%} and promised to be their leader, men-
<div n="lb">tioning the prowess of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he commanded
<div n="lb">his charioteer to make his chariot ready (VII, {@2@}). {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">waited upon {%Bhīṣma%} (mentioning the danger to the {%Kurus%} from
[Page267-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} with the {%Gāṇḍīva,%} etc.; {%Arjuna's%} battle with {%Śiva;%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa; Bhīṣma's%} battle with {%Rāma%}) (VII, {@3@}). {%Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">mentioning {%Karṇa's%} prowess against the {%Kāmbojas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">urged him to fight for the victory of {%Duryodhana.%} Then
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} saluted {%Bhīṣma,%} and, at his return, was worshipped
<div n="lb">by {%Duryodhana%} and the {%Kauravas%} (VII, {@4@}). {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">asked {%Karṇa's%} advice as to who should become the general-
<div n="lb">issimo of the {%Kuru%} army. {%Karṇa%} proposed {%Droṇa%} (VII, {@5@}).
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} requested {%Droṇa%} to take the command (VII, {@6@}).
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa,%} mentioning his knowledge of the {%Veda%} and the {%Śaiva%}
<div n="lb">weapon, etc., and his inability to slay {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%}
<div n="lb">accepted the request. {%Duryodhana%} and the kings performed
<div n="lb">the inauguration of {%Droṇa,%} at which the army rejoiced.
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} arrayed the troops: the {%Sindhu%} king, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the
<div n="lb">right wing, supported by {%Śakuni,%} etc.; {%Kṛpa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the
<div n="lb">left wing, supported by the {%Kāmbojas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the {%Madras,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), in the rear; {%Karṇa%} at the head of all the bowmen.
<div n="lb">The array was in the form of a {%śakaṭa%}(cart). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">disposed his troops in the form of a {%krauñca%} (crane), with
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} at the head. Omens appeared when {%Droṇa%}
<div n="lb">proceeded to battle. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%} were broken
<div n="lb">by {%Droṇa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa%} (VII, {@7@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">urged {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Arjuna%} to check {%Droṇa.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Kekaya%} princes, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), “achieved diverse feats.” {%Droṇa%} put
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops to rout. {%Droṇa%} & the {%Kekaya%} princes,
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). At last {%Droṇa,%} having slain more than two
<div n="lb">{%akṣauhiṇīs,%} “proceeded hence to heaven” (“attained to the
<div n="lb">highest state”) slain by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna.%} D., P., etc., beheld
<div n="lb">him (VII, {@8@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} the particulars of
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa's%} heroism and slaughter (mentioning his knowledge of
<div n="lb">the {%Vedas;%} his ability to remove {%Meru;%} his equality to
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} or {%Uśanas;%} his horses of the {%Sindhu%} breed, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>)) (VII, {@9@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away, and was restored
<div n="lb">to consciousness by the {%Bharata%} ladies. Then he enquired of
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} about {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), especially {%Yuyudhāna%}
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki (b),%} and {%Dhṛṣṭaketu (c),%} and {%Ketumat (d);%} and the
<div n="lb">children of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Kṣatrañjaya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), who,
<div n="lb">giving up all sports for twelve years, and observing excellent
<div n="lb">vows, waited upon {%Bhīṣma%} for the sake of weapons; and the
<div n="lb">five {%Kaikeya%} brothers {%(e);%} and {%Yuyutsu (f),%} and {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna (g)%} (VII, {@10@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} recited the feats of
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa:%} the killing of {%Hayarāja,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), that he had
<div n="lb">vanquished in battle the {%Aṅgas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and that if {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">would summon them, {%Gada,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would take up their
<div n="lb">position in the {%Pāṇḍava%} host; and regretted that {%Duryodhana%} did
<div n="lb">not know {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna;%} the destruction of the {%Kurus%} he
<div n="lb">attributed to himself or to Destiny (VII, {@11@}).—§ 590: {%Sañjaya%}
<div n="lb">begins his narrative in detail. THE ELEVENTH DAY'S BATTLE:
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana,%} having consulted with {%Karṇa%} and {%Duḥśāsana,%}
<div n="lb">etc., asked {%Droṇa%} to seize {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} alive. {%Droṇa%} became
<div n="lb">very glad because {%Duryodhana%} had not asked him to slay
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana%} explained that if {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">were slain, the other {%Pāṇḍavas,%} who were invincible, would
<div n="lb">avenge him; but taken alive, he might be once more van-
<div n="lb">quished at dice, and so all the {%Pāṇḍavas%} be obliged once more
<div n="lb">to go to the woods. {%Droṇa%} said that he would seize {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} if not protected by {%Arjuna%} (with his weapons from
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} and {%Rudra,%} etc.); {%Arjuna,%} therefore, must be with-
<div n="lb">drawn from {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana%} proclaimed the promise
<div n="lb">of {%Droṇa%} to all his troops, in order to make him stick to his
<div n="lb">promise (VII, {@12@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} learned through his spies
<div n="lb">that {%Droṇa%} had promised to seize him, and addressed his
<div n="lb">brothers and allies; {%Arjuna%} consoled him. A fierce battle
[Page268-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">commenced. Protected by {%Droṇa%} and {%Arjuna,%} both hosts
<div n="lb">seemed to stand inactive. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} could not withstand
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa,%} who began to consume the division of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
<div n="lb">(VII, {@13@}). {%Droṇa%} caused a river of blood to flow there.

<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena%} (causing {%Abhimanyu%} to stand aside) & {%Śalya;%} both
<div n="lb">fell down; {%Kṛtavarman%} took {%Śalya%} away on his chariot; the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} vanquished the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} (VII, {@15@}). {%Karṇa's%}
<div n="lb">son {%Vṛṣasena%} attacked the {%Pāṇḍava%} army; {%Nakula's%} son
