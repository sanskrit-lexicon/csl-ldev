[{@Droṇābhiṣekaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
inauguration of Droṇa,” the 71st of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.; cf. Droṇābhiṣecana). § 589: {%Janamejaya%} enquired
of the state of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} on the receipt of intelligence
of {%Bhīṣma's%} death. {%Vaiśampāyana's%} answer: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
asked {%Sañjaya%} about what the {%Kauravas%} did after the fall of
{%Bhīṣma. Sañjaya%} mentioned the arrow-pillow, etc. (cf.
§ 587 foll.), and that the warriors once more went to battle.
The {%Kurus%} desired to make {%Karṇa%} their generalissimo
(mentioning his enmity with {%Bhīṣma%}) (VII, {@1@}). {%Karṇa%}
eulogised {%Bhīṣma%}, and promised to be their leader, men-
tioning the prowess of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); he commanded
his charioteer to make his chariot ready (VII, {@2@}). {%Karṇa%}
waited upon {%Bhīṣma%} (mentioning the danger to the {%Kurus%} from
[Page267-b+ 63]
{%Arjuna%} with the {%Gāṇḍīva%}, etc.; {%Arjuna's%} battle with {%Śiva%};
{%Kṛṣṇa; Bhīṣma's%} battle with {%Rāma%}) (VII, {@3@}). {%Bhīṣma%},
mentioning {%Karṇa's%} prowess against the {%Kāmbojas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>),
urged him to fight for the victory of {%Duryodhana%}. Then
{%Karṇa%} saluted {%Bhīṣma%}, and, at his return, was worshipped
by {%Duryodhana%} and the {%Kauravas%} (VII, {@4@}). {%Duryodhana%}
asked {%Karṇa's%} advice as to who should become the general-
issimo of the {%Kuru%} army. {%Karṇa%} proposed {%Droṇa%} (VII, {@5@}).
{%Duryodhana%} requested {%Droṇa%} to take the command (VII, {@6@}).
{%Droṇa%}, mentioning his knowledge of the {%Veda%} and the {%Śaiva%}
weapon, etc., and his inability to slay {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%},
accepted the request. {%Duryodhana%} and the kings performed
the inauguration of {%Droṇa%}, at which the army rejoiced.
{%Droṇa%} arrayed the troops: the {%Sindhu%} king, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), in the
right wing, supported by {%Śakuni%}, etc.; {%Kṛpa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), in the
left wing, supported by the {%Kāmbojas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); the {%Madras%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), in the rear; {%Karṇa%} at the head of all the bowmen.
The array was in the form of a {%śakaṭa%}(cart). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
disposed his troops in the form of a {%krauñca%} (crane), with
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} at the head. Omens appeared when {%Droṇa%}
proceeded to battle. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%} were broken
by {%Droṇa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa%} (VII, {@7@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
urged {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Arjuna%} to check {%Droṇa%}. The
{%Kekaya%} princes, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>), “achieved diverse feats.” {%Droṇa%} put
the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops to rout. {%Droṇa%} & the {%Kekaya%} princes,
etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>). At last {%Droṇa%}, having slain more than two
{%akṣauhiṇīs%}, “proceeded hence to heaven” (“attained to the
highest state”) slain by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}. D., P., etc., beheld
him (VII, {@8@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} the particulars of
{%Droṇa's%} heroism and slaughter (mentioning his knowledge of
the {%Vedas%}; his ability to remove {%Meru%}; his equality to
{%Bṛhaspati%} or {%Uśanas%}; his horses of the {%Sindhu%} breed, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ι</lang>)) (VII, {@9@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} swooned away, and was restored
to consciousness by the {%Bharata%} ladies. Then he enquired of
{%Sañjaya%} about {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), especially {%Yuyudhāna%}
{%Sātyaki (b%}), and {%Dhṛṣṭaketu (c%}), and {%Ketumat (d%}); and the
children of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Kṣatrañjaya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>), who,
giving up all sports for twelve years, and observing excellent
vows, waited upon {%Bhīṣma%} for the sake of weapons; and the
five {%Kaikeya%} brothers ({%e%}); and {%Yuyutsu (f%}), and {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna (g%}) (VII, {@10@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} recited the feats of
{%Kṛṣṇa%}: the killing of {%Hayarāja%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), that he had
vanquished in battle the {%Aṅgas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>), and that if {%Kṛṣṇa%}
would summon them, {%Gada%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), would take up their
position in the {%Pāṇḍava%} host; and regretted that {%Duryodhana%} did
not know {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}; the destruction of the {%Kurus%} he
attributed to himself or to Destiny (VII, {@11@}).—§ 590: {%Sañjaya%}
begins his narrative in detail. THE ELEVENTH DAY'S BATTLE:
{%Duryodhana%}, having consulted with {%Karṇa%} and {%Duḥśāsana%},
etc., asked {%Droṇa%} to seize {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} alive. {%Droṇa%} became
very glad because {%Duryodhana%} had not asked him to slay
{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana%} explained that if {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
were slain, the other {%Pāṇḍavas%}, who were invincible, would
avenge him; but taken alive, he might be once more van-
quished at dice, and so all the {%Pāṇḍavas%} be obliged once more
to go to the woods. {%Droṇa%} said that he would seize {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} if not protected by {%Arjuna%} (with his weapons from
{%Indra%} and {%Rudra%}, etc.); {%Arjuna%}, therefore, must be with-
drawn from {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana%} proclaimed the promise
of {%Droṇa%} to all his troops, in order to make him stick to his
promise (VII, {@12@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} learned through his spies
that {%Droṇa%} had promised to seize him, and addressed his
brothers and allies; {%Arjuna%} consoled him. A fierce battle
[Page268-a+ 63]
commenced. Protected by {%Droṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}, both hosts
seemed to stand inactive. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} could not withstand
{%Droṇa%}, who began to consume the division of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
(VII, {@13@}). {%Droṇa%} caused a river of blood to flow there.
