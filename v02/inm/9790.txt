[{@Saugandhikāharaṇaṃ@}]¦ (“the bringing of the fragrant
<div n="lb">lotuses”; cf. Tīrthayātrāp.). § 431: When {%Bhīma%} was
<div n="lb">embraced by {%Hanumat%} his fatigue went off. {%Hanumat%} asked
<div n="lb">him not to tell anyone that he dwelt there; this was the
<div n="lb">time of the arrival of the gods and of the {%Gandharvas%}
<div n="lb">(cf. v. 11220); he declared himself willing if {%Bhīma%} might
<div n="lb">wish it to go to {%Hāstinapura%} and slay the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%}
<div n="lb">etc., and dive into the army of his foes, giving leonine roars
<div n="lb">and remaining on the flagstaff of {%Arjuna's%} chariot. Then
<div n="lb">{%Hanumat%} vanished (III, {@151@}).—§ 432: Description of the
<div n="lb">proceeding of {%Bhīma%} along the {%Gandhamādana%} till he found
<div n="lb">the lotuses (III, {@152@}). Description of the lotus-lake, near
<div n="lb">{%Kailāsa,%} guarded by hundreds of thousands of {%Rākṣasas%}
<div n="lb">(called {%Krodhavaśāḥ%}), sprung from a cascade near the abode
<div n="lb">of {%Kubera,%} the sporting place of {%Kubera,%} frequented by
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas, Apsarases,%} gods, divine {%ṛṣis, Yakṣas, Kimpuru-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣas, Rākṣasas,%} and {%Kinnaras. Bhīma%} drank of the water
<div n="lb">(III, {@153@}). The {%Krodhavaśas%} ordered {%Bhīma%} to ask the
<div n="lb">permission of {%Kubera%} before he entered the lake; but {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">plunged into the water, and as the {%Rākṣasas%} attacked him,
<div n="lb">he slew 100 of them with his mace, inlaid with golden
<div n="lb">plates, and then drank of the water, by which his strength
<div n="lb">was fully restored, and gathered {%saugandhika%}-lotuses, while
<div n="lb">the {%Krodhavaśas%} fled through the sky to the peaks of {%Kailāsa%}
<div n="lb">and gave account to {%Kubera,%} who said: “Let {%Bhīma%} take as
<div n="lb">many lotuses as he likes.” The {%Rākṣasas%} then returned to
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} (III, {@154@}).—§ 433: As there arose a violent wind
<div n="lb">with gravel, meteors, thunder, darkness, earthquake, dust,
<div n="lb">and evil omens, {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} having learned from {%Kṛṣṇā%}
<div n="lb">the depart of {%Bhīma,%} and alleging that {%Bhīma%} had not
<div n="lb">formerly done any wrong to the {%Siddhas%} ({%siddhānāṃ brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%vādināṃ,%} v. 11415), resolved to find out {%Bhīma%} and let
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkaca%} carry {%Kṛṣṇā,%} while other {%Rākṣasas%} carried the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and the brahmans, and so they proceeded with
<div n="lb">{%Lomaśa%} to the lake, where the slaughtered {%Yakṣas%} were
<div n="lb">lying, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} entreated {%Bhīma%} never again to
<div n="lb">offend the gods; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} began to sport in the lake,
<div n="lb">and the warders (i.e. the Rākṣasas), with rocks for weapons,
<div n="lb">bowed down in humility. There they dwelt for a short time
<div n="lb">on the slopes of {%Gandhamādana,%} expecting {%Arjuna%} (III, {@155@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 434: One day when {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} remembering the
<div n="lb">tīrthas, rivers ({%Ilā,%} etc.), etc., that they had visited, consulted
<div n="lb">with {%Bhīma%} how they should repair to the abode of
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśravaṇa (b),%} a voice from the sky said that they must
<div n="lb">first return to {%Badarī%} and thence to the hermitage of
<div n="lb">{%Vṛṣaparvan(c)%} and that of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa.%} There came a shower
<div n="lb">of blossoms. According to the counsel of {%Dhaumya,%} they
<div n="lb">all returned to the hermitage of {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@156@}).
