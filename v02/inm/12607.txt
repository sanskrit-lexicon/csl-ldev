{@Yayāti@},¦ an ancient king, son of Nahuṣa. § 3 (Anukra-

§ 143 (Nahuṣa): I, {@75@}, 3155 (second son of Nahuṣa),
3156 (became king), 3158 (his sons).—§ 144 (cf. Yayātyup.):
Having, after 1,000 years, been attacked with decrepitude,
{%Y%}. asked his sons, one by one, to give him their youth and
take upon them his decrepitude, but only the youngest, {%Puru%},
yielded to his wish, and taking upon himself the old age of
{%Y%}. he ruled the kingdom, while {%Y.%}, as strong as a tiger,
enjoyed the company of his two wives and, in the {%Caitra-%}
{%ratha%} wood, of {%Viśvācī%}, but without becoming satiated.
He then recited some verses (vv. 3174—3177) and took back
from his son his own decrepitude, giving him back his youth.
He then installed {%Pūru%} on the throne, saying that he was his
true heir, and should continue the lineage which should be
named after him. {%Y%}. then retired to {%Bhṛgutuṅga%}, and having
spent a long time in ascetism, observing the vow of fasting,
he died and ascended to heaven with his wives (I, {@75@}):

{@83@}, 3432 (the sons of {%Y%}. were the foll.: with Devayānī
Yadu and Turvasu, with Śarmiṣṭhā Druhyu, Anu and
Pūru), 3434, 3450, 3452, (3455), 3460 ({%Nāhuṣaḥ%}), (3461),
(3463) (Uśanas cursed {%Y%}. to be overcome with decrepitude,
etc.).—§ 148 (cf. Yayātyup.): {%Y%}. transferred his decrepitude
to {%Pūru%}, etc. (cf. § 144) and cursed his other sons, {%Yadu (b%}),
{%Turvasu (c), Druhyu (d), Anu (e%}) (I, {@84@}). {%Y%}. sported with
{%Viśvācī%} in the {%Nandana%} wood and in {%Alakā%}, and in the northern
summit of {%Meru. Y%}. then recited some verses (v. 3510 foll.)
and installed {%Pūru%} as king (cf. § 144). The offspring of
{%Yadu (b), Turvasu (c), Druhyu (d), Anu (e%}), and {%Pūru (f%})

(i.e. Uttara-Yayātyupākhyāna, cf. Sambhavap.): Having
installed {%Pūru%} on the throne, {%Y%}. entered the wood to lead the
life of a hermit for 1,000 years and then ascended to {%Svarga%}
(I, {@86@}), where he was reverenced by the gods, the {%Sādhyas%},
[Page774-a+ 63]
the {%Maruts%}, and the {%Vasus%}, wandering about in {%Devaloka%} and
{%Brahmaloka%}. One day {%Indra%} asked him what he had said to
{%Pūru%} when he bestowed the kingdom upon him. {%Y%}. answered
that he had said: “The whole country between the {%Gaṅgā%} and
the {%Yamunā%} is thine, this is the central region of the earth,
the outlying regions will be the dominions of thy brothers.
Those without anger are ever superior to those under its
sway, etc.” (I, {@87@}). As {%Y%}. said that he did not know his
equal in ascetic austerities among men, gods, {%Gandharvas%},
and {%maharṣis, Indra%} declared that, owing to this haughtiness,
he should fall from heaven, yet he should fall among the
virtuous. When falling, he was beheld by the {%rājarṣi%}
{%Aṣṭaka%} (I, {@88@}), of whom he was the maternal grandfather;
{%Y%}. spoke disapprovingly of haughtiness, etc., and told that,
leaving earth, he had obtained many high regions for 1,000
years, then he had dwelt in the town of {%Indra%} (having 1,000
gates and extending 1,000 yojanas all around) for 1,000 years,
then for 1,000 years in the world of {%Prajāpati%}, then in the
abode of {%Devadeva%} (i.e. Viṣṇu); he had also dwelt in
{%Nandana%} for 100 ayutas of years, assuming any form at will,
sporting with the Apsarases; then there had come a messenger
of the gods with a grim visage, who thrice had shouted to
him “fall”; then he had fallen from {%Nandana%}, hearing,
while falling, the compassionate exclamations of the gods,
who had directed him to fall to the sacrificial place of
{%Aṣṭaka%} and his companions (I, {@89@}). {%Y%}. continued: Those
who speak of their own merits after having dwelt for 60,000
or 80,000 years in heaven, are doomed to suffer the pains of
the hell called {%bhauma%} (i.e. existence on the earth), and are
attacked by certain {%Rākṣasas%} with sharp teeth. {%Y%}. then
taught the lore of transmigration and emancipation (I, {@90@}).
{%Y%}. explained the duties of {%gṛhasthas, bhikṣus, brahmacārins%},
and {%vānaprasthas%}, and the different kinds of {%munis%} and {%mauna%}
(vows of silence) (I, {@91@}). {%Y%}. then said: “I now shall fall
into the {%bhauma%} hell, the {%Lokapas%} of Brahmán hasten me
thither.” The kings {%Aṣṭaka, Pratardana%} (I, {@92@}), {%Vasu-%}
{%manas Auṣadaśvi%}, and {%Śibi Auśīnara%}, offered him their
{%“lokas”%} and volunteered to go to hell ({%naraka%}) in his place;
{%Y%}. did not accept the offer. Then appeared five golden chariots,
in which they all five ascended to heaven, {%Śibi%} leaving the
others behind him. {%Y%}. told them that he was their maternal
grandfather, that he had given the whole earth with her
horses, etc., to brahmans, and that the earth and the firmament
and fire existed owing to his truth. *(I, {@93@}): I, {@86@}, 3535

sitting on his throne, there came a brahman who asked him
for wealth for his preceptor, with whom he had made the
appointment always to question the giver with what feelings
he would give him what he asked for. {%Y%}. answered that he

ascending to heaven after death and falling down therefrom,
cf. § 149).—§ 566 (do.): As {%Y%}. was falling headlong towards
the earth, while the kings and Si. and Aps. laughed, there
came, at the command of {%Indra%}, a person whose business it
was to hurl down those whose merits were exhausted, and
told him that his pride had caused his fall. {%Y%}. uttered the
wish that he might fall among the righteous. He fell down
among his daughter's sons {%Pratardana, Vasumanas, Śibi%}, and
{%Aṣṭaka%}, in the {%Naimiṣa%} wood, where they performed a
{%vājapeya%} sacrifice. They gave him their merits ({%puṇya%},
{%dharma%}, etc.), and the result of all their sacrifices. {%Mādhavī%}
also came and gave him the moiety of hers, likewise {%Gālava%},
who gave him the eighth part of his (V, {@121@}). As soon as {%Y%}.
was recognized by those virtuous persons, he rose again to
heaven without touching the surface of the earth, and his
four daughter's sons, in a loud voice, repeated the gift of
their merits ({%Aṣṭaka%} had performed hundreds of {%puṇḍarīka%},
{%gosava%}, and {%vājapeya%} sacrifices, {%Śibi%} had never spoken a false-
hood) (V, {@122@}). {%Y%}. was honoured in heaven by G., Aps.,
D.-r,-R.-ṛ, and the gods. {%Brahmán%} explained to him that it
was his vanity alone that had been able to destroy all his
merit (cf. also § 149). Nārada continued: “Such was the
distress into which {%Y%}. fell in consequence of vanity and
{%Gālava%} owing to his obstinacy. Make peace with the sons
of Pāṇḍu” (V, {@123@}): V, {@121@}, 4052, 4053, 4059, 4062

yānap.): {%Y.%}, the son of {%Nahuṣa%}, was the sixth in descent
from Soma. {%Y%}. had five sons: {%Yadu%}, the son of {%Devayānī%},
and thus the grandson of {%Śukra Kāvya%} was the eldest, while
{%Pūru%}, the son of {%Śarmiṣṭhā%} (the daughter of {%Vṛṣaparvan%})
was the youngest. {%Yadu%} (the progenitor of the {%Yādavas%})
humiliated all the kṣatriyas. He did not obey the injunc-
tions of his father, but insulted his father and brothers. He
[Page775-a+ 62]
established himself in the city named after the elephant
({%nāgāhvaye%}, i.e. Hāstinapura). {%Y%}. cursed him and expelled
him from the kingdom. He also cursed his other sons who
were obedient to {%Yadu%}, and placed his youngest son, {%Pūru%}, on
the throne (cf. also §§ 144 and 148): V, {@149@}, 5042 ({%Somāt%}

the brahmans the whole of the wealth in the possession of
{%Mlecchas%}, etc.; he sided with the gods against the {%Asuras%};
having divided the earth into four parts, he gave it away
to four persons (i.e. four {%ṛtvijes%}, Nīl.). His wives were
{%Devayānī%}, daughter of {%Uśanas (Auśanasyāṃ%}), and {%Śarmiṣṭhā%};
he roved through the celestial woods, at last he installed
