{@Prabhāsotpattikathana(ṃ)@}¦ (“on the origin of Pra
<div n="lb">bhāsa”). § 615 (Baladevat.): {%Dakṣa%} had twenty-seven
<div n="lb">daughters, married to {%Soma,%} connected with the several
<div n="lb">constellations serving to help men in calculating time, all
<div n="lb">beautiful; {%Rohiṇī,%} however, was the foremost in beauty.
<div n="lb">As {%Soma%} lived long with {%Rohiṇī,%} his other wives complained
<div n="lb">to {%Dakṣa,%} who got them reconciled. As {%Soma,%} however,
<div n="lb">still continued to live with {%Rohiṇī%} exclusively, his other
<div n="lb">wives once more approached {%Dakṣa,%} who now threatened to
<div n="lb">curse him. His threats were not, however, heeded, and
<div n="lb">when the wives complained a third time, {%Dakṣa%} cursed
<div n="lb">{%Soma,%} so that he was affected with phthisis. His sacrifices,
<div n="lb">etc., were in vain; the herbs became tasteless and failed to
<div n="lb">grow, etc. The gods prevailed upon {%Dakṣa%} to withdraw
<div n="lb">the curse on condition that {%Soma%} should behave equally
<div n="lb">towards all his wives, and bathe in the {%tīrtha%} (sc. {%Prabhāsa%})
<div n="lb">where the {%Sarasvatī%} mingles with the ocean, and adore
<div n="lb">{%Mahādeva%} there; then he should during the one half of the
<div n="lb">month wane every day and during the other wax every day.
<div n="lb">Bathing there on the day of new moon, he was restored.
<div n="lb">{%Dakṣa%} told {%Soma%} not to disregard women and brahmans.
<div n="lb">{%Prabhāsa%} became the foremost of all {%tīrthas; Soma%} bathes
<div n="lb">there on every recurring day of the new moon and regains
<div n="lb">his form and beauty; thence comes its name {%Prabhāsa,%} because
<div n="lb">{%Soma%} there regained his effulgence {%(prabhā).%}
