{@Kurukṣetrakathana(ṃ)@}¦ (“relation of Kurukṣetra”).
<div n="lb">§ 615{%kk%} (Baladevat.): The Ṛ. said to {%Bala-Rāma:%} This
<div n="lb">{%Samantapañcaka%} is said to be the eternal northern altar of
<div n="lb">{%Prajāpati;%} there, in days of yore, the gods performed a great
<div n="lb">sacrifice. The R.-ṛ. {%Kuru%} had cultivated this field for many
<div n="lb">years; hence it came to be called {%Kurukeṣetra%} (“the field of
<div n="lb">Kuru”). Requested by {%Bala-Rāma,%} the Ṛ. related: In days
<div n="lb">of yore {%Kuru%} was engaged in perseveringly tilling this field;
<div n="lb">requested by {%Indra,%} he said: “Those that will die upon
<div n="lb">this plain, shall proceed to regions of bliss after being
<div n="lb">cleansed of their sins.” {%Śakra,%} ridiculing this, went back
<div n="lb">to heaven. This happened repeatedly. {%Indra%} summoned the
<div n="lb">gods, who asked him to stop {%Kuru%} by granting him a boon;
<div n="lb">“if men, by only dying there, were to come to heaven,
<div n="lb">without having performed sacrifices to us, our very existence
<div n="lb">would be endangered.” {%Indra%} then came, and they agreed
<div n="lb">that {%Kuru%} should not toil any more; but those that would
<div n="lb">die there, having abstained from food, with all their senses
<div n="lb">awake, and those that would perish there in battle, should
<div n="lb">go straight to heaven. It was sanctioned by all the principal
<div n="lb">gods, headed by {%Brahmán,%} that on earth there should
<div n="lb">be no more sacred spot than this; those men that per-
<div n="lb">formed austere penances here would all, after laying down
<div n="lb">their bodies, go to {%Brahmán's%} abode; those who gave away
<div n="lb">their wealth here would soon have their wealth doubled;
<div n="lb">those who would reside constantly here would never have to
<div n="lb">behold the region of {%Yama;%} those kings that would perform
<div n="lb">great sacrifices here would reside as long in heaven as earth
<div n="lb">would last. {%Indra%} had himself composed a verse here and
<div n="lb">sang it: “The very dust of {%Kurukṣetra…%} shall cleanse
<div n="lb">persons of wicked acts and carry them to heaven.” The
<div n="lb">principal gods, {%brahmans,%} kings as {%Nṛga,%} etc., having
<div n="lb">performed costly sacrifices here, have, after abandoning their
<div n="lb">bodies, proceeded to heaven. The space between {%Tarantuka%}
<div n="lb">and {%Arantuka%} and the lakes of {%Rāma (Rāmahradānāṃ)%} and
<div n="lb">{%Macakruka%} (C. {%°kra°%}), this {%Kurukṣetra-Samantapañcaka%} is
<div n="lb">called the northern altar of {%Prajāpati.%} All that {%Śakra%} said
<div n="lb">was approved by {%Brahmán, Viṣṇu,%} and {%Maheśvara%} (IX, {@53@}).
