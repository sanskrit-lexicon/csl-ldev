{@Dyūtaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the gambling,” the
<div n="lb">28th of the minor parvans of the Mhbhr.). § 10 (Parvas.):
<div n="lb">I, {@2,@} 319.—§ 293: When {%Vyāsa%} with his disciples came
<div n="lb">to take leave, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked him about the celestial,
<div n="lb">atmospherical, and terrestrial portents which, according to
<div n="lb">the statement of {%Nārada,%} had happened at the {%rājasūya.%}
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} said that in thirteen years they would be fulfilled by
<div n="lb">the destruction of all the {%kṣatriyas,%} and that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">would that very night see {%Śiva%} gazing incessantly towards
<div n="lb">the direction presided over by the king of the {%Pitṛs%} (i.e. the
<div n="lb">south). Then {%Vyāsa%} with his disciples proceeded towards
<div n="lb">{%Kailāsa. Yudhiṣṭhira%} resolved to die in order that he might
<div n="lb">not be the cause of the destruction of the {%kṣatriyas,%} but called
<div n="lb">back from his intention by {%Phālguna%} (i.e. Arjuna), he took
<div n="lb">upon him the vow not to speak a harsh word to his brothers
<div n="lb">or to any of the kings. Then, having gratified the {%Pitṛs%} and
<div n="lb">gods, he entered his own palace, accompanied by his ministers
<div n="lb">(II, {@46@}).—§ 294: {%Duryodhana,%} accompanied by {%Śakuni,%} by
<div n="lb">and by beheld all the {%sabhā;%} he mistook a piece of crystal
<div n="lb">for water and drew off his clothes, mistook a lake for land
<div n="lb">and fell in, etc., and was laughed at by {%Bhīma, Arjuna,%} the
<div n="lb">twins, and the menials of the palace. Filled with wrath
<div n="lb">and jealousy he became pale, and returned to {%Hāstinapura,%}
<div n="lb">together with {%Śakuni%} (II, {@47@}). {%Śakuni%} told him to ask
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who was very fond of gambling and did not
<div n="lb">know how to play, to play at dice; then he {%(Śakuni),%} who was
<div n="lb">skilled in dice, would win his kingdom and prosperity for
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} (II, {@48@}). {%Śakuni%} told {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} was pale and depressed; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">the cause; {%Duryodhana%} told him that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} supported
<div n="lb">88,000 {%snātakas,%} giving to each of them thirty slave-girls; that
<div n="lb">10,000 other brahmans daily ate at his palace the best food
<div n="lb">off golden plates; that the king of {%Kāmboja%} sent to him
<div n="lb">innumerable skins, etc.; that the Ocean brought the {%Vāruṇa%}
<div n="lb">nectar to him in a vessel of copper, as the celestial wives
<div n="lb">{%(amarastriyaḥ)%} to {%Indra;%} that {%Vāsudeva,%} having brought an
<div n="lb">excellent conch, bathed him with sea-water brought in 1,000
<div n="lb">jars of gold, etc., from the eastern, southern, and western
<div n="lb">oceans; that the conches, which were blown when 100,000
<div n="lb">brahmans were fed, could be heard there almost incessantly,
<div n="lb">etc. {%Duryodhana%} proposed to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to invite {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} to a game at dice with {%Śakuni,%} and prevented him
<div n="lb">from consulting {%Vidura%} till he had had a {%sabhā%} built. Then
<div n="lb">he ordered {%Vidura,%} who dissuaded him in vain, to invite
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura%} in great sorrow went to {%Bhīṣma%} (II,
<div n="lb">{@49@}).—At the request of {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related
<div n="lb">that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} having ascertained the opinion of {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">{%(b),%} sought to bring {%Duryodhana%} back from his purpose to
<div n="lb">play at dice; but {%Duryodhana%} would not give way, relating
<div n="lb">that the {%Nīpas, Citrakas,%} the {%Kaukuras,%} the {%Kāraskaras,%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Lohajaṅghas%} were like bondsmen in the house of {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira,%} and that {%Bhīma, Arjuna,%} and {%Draupadī%} had laughed
<div n="lb">at his mistake regarding the crystal, etc. (II, {@50@}).—§ 295:
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} enumerated to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} the articles brought
<div n="lb">as tribute from various peoples to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Yājñasenī%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Kṛṣṇā) daily (during the {%rājasūya%}) took care that
<div n="lb">everybody, including the deformed and the dwarfs, had eaten
[Page283-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">before she herself took her meal. Only two peoples did not
<div n="lb">pay tribute to {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} the {%Pāñcālas,%} in consequence of
<div n="lb">their relationship by marriage, and the {%Andhaka-Vṛṣṇis,%}
<div n="lb">in consequence of their friendship (II, {@52@}).—§ 296: {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} continued to enumerate kings, etc., who waited
<div n="lb">upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at the {%rājasūya.%} The Ocean brought that
<div n="lb">{%Vāruṇa%} conch ({%śaikyaṃ,%} “in a sling,” PCR., i.e. in a strap,
<div n="lb">cf. BR.), which {%Viśvakarman%} had constructed with 1,000
<div n="lb">{%niṣkas,%} and which {%Prajāpati%} had in a former {%kalpa%} presented
<div n="lb">to {%Indra;%} with that conch {%Kṛṣṇa%} anointed {%(abhiṣiktaḥ)%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} When the conches were blown, those among
<div n="lb">the kings who were weak fell down, and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki,%} the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and {%Keśava%} laughed; then {%Bībhatsu%}
<div n="lb">(= Arjuna) gave to the principal brahmans 500 bullocks
<div n="lb">with horns plated with gold, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} obtained, like
<div n="lb">{%Hariścandra,%} such properity that he surpassed {%Rantideva,%}
<div n="lb">{%Nābhāga, Yauvanāśva, Manu, Pṛthu Vainya, Bhagīratha, Yayāti,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Nahuṣa%} (II, {@53@}).—§ 297: Continuation of the con-
<div n="lb">versation between {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Duryodhana%} (II, {@54, 55@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 298: As {%Śakuni%} recommended the match of dice and
<div n="lb">praised his own dexterity in gambling, and {%Duryodhana%} spoke
<div n="lb">reprovingly of {%Vidura%} on account of his fondness for the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc., {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} reluctantly caused the {%sabhā%}
<div n="lb">(called {%Toraṇasphāṭikā%}) to be built, with 1,000 columns
<div n="lb">adorned with gold and lapis lazuli, a {%krośa%} in length and
<div n="lb">breadth, and then ordered {%Vidura%} to bring {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and
<div n="lb">his brothers (II, {@56, 57@}). {%Vidura%} arrived at the palace
<div n="lb">of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and invited him. {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} having
<div n="lb">learned that he should have to play with {%Śakuni,-Viviṃśati,%}
<div n="lb">{%Citrasena, Satyavrata, Purumitra,%} and {%Jaya,%} “the most
<div n="lb">desperate and terrible gamblers, always depending upon
<div n="lb">deceit,” was unwilling to come; but as he had made the vow
<div n="lb">never to refuse when challenged, he set out for {%Hāstinapura%}
<div n="lb">the next day with his relatives, {%Draupadī,%} brahmans, etc.,
<div n="lb">riding on the chariot taken charge of (so BR.) by {%Bāhlīka,%}
<div n="lb">and when he had arrived he saluted {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa, Aśvatthāman, Somadatta, Duryodhana, Śalya, Saubala,%}
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana, Jayadratha,%} etc., and {%Gāndhārī%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">(II, {@58@}). {%Śakuni%} exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to gamble. {%Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} quoted {%Asita Devala (b),%} but he was obliged to assent;
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} said that he himself would supply jewels, etc.,
<div n="lb">and that it was for him that {%Śakuni%} would play (II, {@59@}).
<div n="lb">The play began, the stake being a wreath of pearls, which
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni%} won (II, {@60@}). {%Śakuni%} then won from {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">his treasury, slave-girls, serving-men, elephants, chariots,
<div n="lb">the {%Gandharva%} horses which {%Citrasena%} had given to {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">his warriors, and {%nidhis%} (II, {@61@}). {%Vidura,%} addressing {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣtṛa,%} quoted the words of {%Kāvya,%} and reminded him
<div n="lb">that among the {%Bhojas%} they had abandoned an unworthy
<div n="lb">{%(asamañjasaṃ)%} son; the {%Andhakas, Yādavas,%} and {%Bhojas%} had
<div n="lb">abandoned {%Kaṃsa,%} and when he had been slain by {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">the whole tribe became glad for a hundred years;
<div n="lb">“[likewise] let {%Arjuna%} slay this {%Suyodhana%} at thy command”;
<div n="lb">he quoted what {%Kāvya%} said to the {%Asuras%} in order to
<div n="lb">induce them to abandon {%Jambha,%} and related how a king
<div n="lb">from greediness after gold killed some gold-vomiting fowls
<div n="lb">that dwelt in his house, and so destroyed both his present
<div n="lb">and future wealth (II, {@62@}). {%Vidura%} warned against the
<div n="lb">gambling, and suggested to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} rather to win the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} than their wealth, and to let {%Śakuni,%} the hill-king
<div n="lb">{%(Pārvatīyaḥ),%} return whence he came (II, {@63@}). {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">blamed {%Vidura%} for his partiality towards the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and
<div n="lb">said that he would only follow the advice of his own intellect.
[Page284-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Vidura%} complained of the ingratitude of kings and their
<div n="lb">fondness of flattery (II, {@64@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} lost his wealth,
<div n="lb">kine, horses, goats, and sheep, “from {%Parṇāśā%} to the eastern
<div n="lb">bank of the {%Sindhu,%}” his city, country, lands, and the wealth
<div n="lb">of all dwelling therein, except that of the brahmans, and all
<div n="lb">those persons themselves except the brahmans, the ear-rings and
<div n="lb">{%niṣkas%} and other ornaments of the princes who were present,
<div n="lb">then {%Nakula, Sahadeva, Arjuna, Bhīma,%} himself, and {%Draupadī;%}
<div n="lb">now {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Vidura,%} etc., all gave way to
<div n="lb">grief, but {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Karṇa, Duḥśāsana,%} etc., were glad
<div n="lb">(II, {@65@}).—§ 299: {%Duryodhana%} ordered {%Kṣattṛ%} (i.e. {%Vidura%})
<div n="lb">to bring hither {%Draupadī%} to sweep the chambers and stay
<div n="lb">with the servant maids; {%Vidura%} declared that having lost
<div n="lb">himself, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} could not lawfully stake {%Draupadī,%} and
<div n="lb">said: “A goat had once swallowed a knife, and when it was
<div n="lb">pierced by it the hunter placed the head of the animal on the
<div n="lb">ground, and when drawing the knife out he tore its throat
<div n="lb">frightfully; therefore do not swallow the wealth of the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%}” (II, {@66@}). Then {%Duryodhana%} ordered the {%prā-%}
<div n="lb">{%tikāmin%} (a {%sūta%}) to bring {%Draupadī;%} she ordered him to ask
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} whether he had lost himself or her first; as
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said nothing, {%Duryodhana%} ordered that {%Draupadī%}
<div n="lb">should come and put her question in the assembly; she sent
<div n="lb">the {%sūta%} back to the assembly saying that she would do what
<div n="lb">aged and virtuous persons would tell her; all sat without
<div n="lb">uttering a word; but {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent a trusted messenger
<div n="lb">to {%Draupadī,%} directing that, although in consequence of her
<div n="lb">season having come she was attired in one piece of cloth only.
<div n="lb">she should come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly.
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} again ordered the {%prātikāmin%} to bring her, and
<div n="lb">as he seemed irresolute, he asked {%Duḥśāsana%} to do so. As
<div n="lb">she would flee to the ladies' household, {%Duḥśāsana%} dragged
<div n="lb">her in by her hair, while she was praying to {%Kṛṣṇa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Jiṣṇu%} (i.e. {%Arjuna%}), who were {%Nārāyaṇa%} and {%Nara,%} and
<div n="lb">blaming {%Droṇa, Bhīṣma, Vidura,%} etc., for looking silently on
<div n="lb">this crime. As she was casting a glance upon her enraged
<div n="lb">lords, {%Duḥśāsana,%} dragging her still more forcibly, addressed
<div n="lb">her, “Slave! slave!” and laughed aloud, applauded by
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa, Śakuni,%} and {%Duryodhana,%} while all the others were
<div n="lb">filled with sorrow. {%Bhīṣma%} declared himself to be unable to
<div n="lb">decide the question she had put. As she then asked the
<div n="lb">others present to decide it, {%Duḥśāsana%} spoke many harsh words,
<div n="lb">and {%Bhīma,%} looking at {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} gave way to wrath (II,
<div n="lb">{@67@}). {%Bhīma%} blamed {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and ordered {%Sahadeva%} to
<div n="lb">bring fire, as he wanted to burn the hands of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} but
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} appeased him. {%Vikarṇa%} repeatedly appealed to those
<div n="lb">present to decide the question, and as they did not say one
<div n="lb">word, he declared that as {%Yudhiṣṭhīra%} must be regarded as of
<div n="lb">no authority, because he had shown himself addicted to the
<div n="lb">vice of gambling, etc., he regarded {%Draupadī%} as not won. All
<div n="lb">applauded him, except {%Karṇa,%} who maintained that she had
<div n="lb">been justly won, and as, contrary to the ordinance of the
<div n="lb">gods that a woman should have only one husband, she had
<div n="lb">five husbands, there was no impropriety in dragging her to
<div n="lb">the assembly, and even to uncover her. {%Karṇa%} then asked
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana%} to take off the robes of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the attire
<div n="lb">of {%Draupadī.%} The {%Pāṇḍavas%} took off their upper garments,
<div n="lb">and {%Duḥśāsana%} began to drag off the attire of {%Draupadī.%}
<div n="lb">But as she thought of and cried to {%Hari%} (i.e. {%Kṛṣṇa%}), {%Dharma%}
<div n="lb">continually covered her anew with excellent clothes. {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">swore that he would drink the blood of {%Duḥśāsana.%} All
<div n="lb">blamed {%Duḥśāsana%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Vidura%} exhorted the
<div n="lb">assembly to answer the question put by {%Draupadī,%} and related
[Page284-b+ 57]
<div n="lb">the dialogue of {%Prahlāda%} (q.v.) and {%Āṅgirasa%} (i.e. {%Sudhanvan%})
<div n="lb">(§ 300).—§ 300: v. {%Prahlāda.%}—§ 301: The kings answered
<div n="lb">not a word, and {%Karṇa%} told {%Duḥśāsana%} to take away the
<div n="lb">slave-woman {%Kṛṣṇā%} to the inner apartments (II, {@68@}).
<div n="lb">Dragged by {%Duḥśāsana, Draupadī%} saluted the assembly,
<div n="lb">complained of being exposed to the gaze of the crowd, and
<div n="lb">again asked them to answer her question. {%Bhīṣma%} again
<div n="lb">declared himself unable to decide it, but thought {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">ought to decide it (II, {@69@}). {%Duryodhana%} said to {%Draupadī:%}
<div n="lb">“Let thy husbands decide the question, and, by making
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the just a liar, free thee from slavery.” {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">said that only his obedience to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and the admoni-
<div n="lb">tions of {%Arjuna%} retained him from killing the wretched sons
<div n="lb">of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} and {%Vidura%} asked him to
<div n="lb">forbear (II, {@70@}). {%Karṇa%} exhorted {%Draupadī%} to choose a new
<div n="lb">husband among the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">after having exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to decide the question,
<div n="lb">uncovered his left thigh and showed it to {%Draupadī. Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">swore that he would break this thigh of his. {%Vidura%} warned
<div n="lb">them, and was of opinion that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had no right to
<div n="lb">stake her. {%Duryodhana%} said that if {%Bhīma, Arjuna,%} and the
<div n="lb">twins declared that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was not their master, then
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} should be free. {%Arjuna%} said that he was certainly
<div n="lb">their master before the play, “but having lost himself, let all
<div n="lb">the {%Kauravas%} judge whose master he could be after that.”
<div n="lb">Just then a jackal began to cry near the {%agnihotra%} of {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra,%} and other terrible omens were heard. On that account
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī%} and {%Vidura%} remonstrated with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} who
<div n="lb">blamed {%Duryodhana%} and granted a boon to {%Kṛṣṇā.%} She chose
<div n="lb">that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should become free from slavery. As she was
<div n="lb">granted a second boon, she asked that {%Bhīma%} and his brothers
<div n="lb">with their chariots and bows should regain their liberty.
<div n="lb">She refused to ask a third boon (II, {@71@}). {%Karṇa%} praised
<div n="lb">{%Draupadī%} for having saved her husbands. {%Bhīma%} threatened
<div n="lb">to slay all his foes instantly, but was retained by {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (II, {@72@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} sent {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">with his brothers and {%Kṛṣṇā%} upon their chariots to {%Indra-%}
<div n="lb">{%prastha,%} having asked him not to remember the harshness of
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} (II, {@73@}).
