{@Ambuvīca@}.¦ § 242: I, {@204@}, 7476: Karṇa spoke con-
temptuously of Bhīṣma and Droṇa, saying that everyone's
happiness depended on destiny and not on his friends, etc.,
mentioning the Magadha king Ambuvīca at Rājagṛha, whose
affairs were in the hands of his minister Mahākarṇi, himself
never attending to them; his minister appropriated everything
belonging to the king (his queen, treasures, and sovereignty),
but he did not succeed in acquiring the kingdom.
