{@Bhūmiparvan(°va)@}¦ (“the section relating to the earth”;
the 68th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).—§ 10 (Parvas.):
I, {@2@}, (337).—[§ 575]: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wishes to hear about
the extent of the ocean, of {%Śākadvīpa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Sañjaya%}
describes the seven [great] islands, the moon and the sun, and
{%Rāhu. Jambu-parvata%} (i.e. Jambu-dvīpa, v. Nīl.) extends for
18,600 {%yojanas%}. The extent of the salt ocean is twice this;
it has many kingdoms, mountains, etc., peopled by Si. and
Cā., and is circular in form. Then {%Śākadvīpa (b%}) (VI, {@11@}).
In the North is the ocean of clarified butter; then that of
curds; then that of wine; then another of water. The
extent of the islands is doubled as they proceed further
and further towards the North. In the island in the
middle is the great mountain {%Gaura%} of red arsenic; in the
western the mountain {%Kṛṣṇa%}, the friend (i.e. favourite abode,
PCR.) of {%Nārāyaṇa%}, where {%Keśava%} guards celestial gems and
bestows happiness on creatures. The clump of {%Kuśa%}-grass in
{%Kuśa-dvīpa%} and the {%Śālmali%} tree in {%Śālmalika%} are adored.
In the {%Krauñca%} island also the mountain {%Mahā-Krauñca%}
(a mine of all kinds of gems) is always adored by all four
castes of men. There is the huge mountain {%Gomanta%}
(consisting of all kinds of metals), whereon, with the
emancipated ({%mokṣibhiḥ%}), the puissant {%Nārāyaṇa Hari%} always
resides. In {%Kuśadvīpa%} are six principal mountains (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); the
intervening spaces increase in the ratio of one to two as they
proceed further and further towards the North; and seven
{%Varṣas%} (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), where D. and G., etc., sport, and the inhabitants
never die, and there are no robbers or {%Mlecchas%}; all the
residents are almost white and very delicate. In the {%Krauñca%}
island are six mountains (<lang n="greek">η</lang>); the intervening spaces increase
in the ratio of one to two; there are seven countries ({%deśāḥ%})
(<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), inhabited by D. and G.; the people are almost white.
In the island of {%Puṣkara%} is the mountain {%Puṣkara%}, with
jewels and gems; there {%Prajāpati%} always dwells, adored by
D. and M.-ṛ.; diverse gems from {%Jambu-dvīpa%} are used there.
In all these islands truth, etc., increase in the ratio of one
to two, as the islands become more and more remote. The
land in all those islands comprises but one country, for that
is said to be one country in which one religion is met with.
{%Prajāpati%} always dwells there, protecting those islands. Cooked
food comes there of itself. After these regions is seen {%Samā (c%}).
Then he speaks of {%Svarbhānu%} ({%d%}; v. Rāhu), {%Candramas (e%}),
{%Sūrya (f%}). “I have now told thee the construction of the
universe according to the {%Śāstras%}. Therefore pacify thy son
{%Duryodhana%}.” Blessing upon the reader (VI, {@12@}).
