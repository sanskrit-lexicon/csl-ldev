<div n="lb">In the North is the ocean of clarified butter; then that of
<div n="lb">curds; then that of wine; then another of water. The
<div n="lb">extent of the islands is doubled as they proceed further
<div n="lb">and further towards the North. In the island in the
<div n="lb">middle is the great mountain {%Gaura%} of red arsenic; in the
<div n="lb">western the mountain {%Kṛṣṇa,%} the friend (i.e. favourite abode,

<div n="lb">land in all those islands comprises but one country, for that
<div n="lb">is said to be one country in which one religion is met with.
