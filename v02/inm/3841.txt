{@Dvaitavanapraveśa(ḥ)@}¦ (“proceeding to the Dvaitavana
forest”) (cf. Arjunābhigamanap.). § 322: The {%Pāṇḍavas%},
with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Dhaumya%}, on costly chariots yoked with
excellent steeds, went into the forest, distributing niṣkas of
gold, etc., to brahmans versed in {%Śikṣā%} (i.e., vedic pronuncia-
tion, PCR., or “grammar and the other vedāṅgas,” Nīl.),
{%akṣara%} (= vedic orthography, PCR.; = veda, Nīl.), and
{%mantras%} (= {%praṇava%}, i.e. the syllable {%oṃ%}, Nīl.), and followed
by twenty attendants with bows, etc., while {%Indrasena%}, with
the princess's (i.e. {%Subhadrā's%}, Nīl.) clothes and ornaments
and the nurses and maidservants, followed in a chariot.
The citizens walked round {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and the brahmans
and principal men of {%Kurujāṅgala%} of all castes saluted him
and blamed the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, etc. {%Arjuna%} told them that
after their exile they would take away the good name of
their enemies, and asked them to beseech the ascetics for their
good. At last they returned to their respective abodes (III,
{@23@}). After a conference between {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Arjuna%},
they resolved upon dwelling for these twelve years at the
sacred lake {%Dvaitavana%} (see BR.) in the forest of the same
name (copious description), on the banks of {%Bhogavatī%} (i.e.
Sarasvati, Nīl.), surrounded by many brahmans, and saluted
[Page281-b+ 63]
by hosts of {%Cāraṇas%} and {%Siddhas%}, who came to see {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} (III, {@24@}).—§ 323: While they were dwelling there,
{%Dhaumya%} performed their {%iṣṭis%} (i.e. {%darśa-paurṇamāsa%}, etc.,
Nīl.) and offerings to the {%Pitṛs%}, etc. Once the old {%ṛṣi%}
{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} came to them and smiled, recollecting {%Rāma%}
{%Dāśarathi%}, whom he had seen on the top of the {%Ṛṣyamūka%}, and
comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by reminding him of the aforesaid {%Rāma%},
{%Nābhāga, Bhagīratha%}, etc., and {%Alarka%}, the king of the {%Kāśis%}
and the {%Karūṣas (b%}), the seven {%ṛṣis%}, who had followed the
ordinance of the Creator and therefore blazed in the firmament;
“so you will regain prosperity.” Then he went away in a
northerly direction (III, {@25@}).—§ 324: The {%Dvaitavana%} forest
becoming filled with brahmans ({%Bhṛgus, Āṅgirasas, Vāsiṣṭhas%},
{%Kāśyapas, Āgastyas, Ātreyas%}, etc.), and always resounding with
Vedic recitations, mingling with the twangs of the bows of the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, a beautiful union of {%brahman%} and {%kṣatriya%} customs
was produced. Therefore one evening the {%ṛṣi Baka Dālbhya%}
represented to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that the {%kṣatriya%} should always
consult with a brahman, as did the {%Asura%} king {%Bali%}, the son
of {%Virocana%}, who went to no other {%tīrtha%} than the brahmans,
and then had all his wishes gratified, but who met with
destruction when he began to act unjustly towards them.
Then all those brahmans, {%Dvaipāyana, Nārada, Jāmadagnya%},
etc. (enumeration) ({%a%}), praised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (III, {@26@}).
