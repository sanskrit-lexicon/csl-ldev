§ 12: When {%Janamejaya%}, the son of {%Parikṣit%}, with his
brothers {%Śrutasena, Ugrasena%}, and {%Bhīmasena%} was attending
his long sacrifice at {%Kurukṣetra%}, his brothers beat an offspring
of {%Saramā. Saramā%} then cursed them, saying that evil should
come upon them unexpectedly. § 13: {%Janamejaya%} then
returned to {%Hāstinapura%} and began to search for a purohita
who might neutralize the curse; one day when hunting he
obtained for this purpose {%Somaśravas%}, son of the {%ṛṣi Śruta-%}
{%śravas%} and a serpent; {%Somaśravas%} would grant to any brahman
whatever might be demanded of him. {%Janamejaya%} then
conquered {%Takṣaśilā%}.—§ 14: About this time there was
a {%ṛṣi%} named {%Āyoda Dhaumya%}, with three disciples, {%Upamanyu%},
{%Āruṇi Pāñcālya%} (q.v.), and {%Veda%}.—§ 15: Upamanyu (q.v.).—
§ 16: Veda (q.v.).—§ 17: Ut(t)aṅka (q.v.) (I, {@3@}).
