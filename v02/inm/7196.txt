[{@Mātalīyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Mātali”). (Cf. Mātalīyam upākhyānaṃ.) § 564 (Bhaga-
vady.). The holy {%Ṛṣi (bhagavān ṛṣiḥ) Kaṇva%} said to
{%Duryodhana%} in the assembly of the {%Kurus: Brahmán%}, the
grandsire of the universe ({%Lokapitāmahaḥ%}), is indestructible
and eternal. The holy {%Ṛṣis (bhagavantāv ṛṣī) Nara%} and
{%Nārāyaṇa%} are of the same character. Of all the sons of
{%Aditi, Viṣṇu%} alone is eternal…In this connection is
cited an old story: {%Mātali%}, the charioteer of {%Indra%}, had, by
his wife {%Sudharmā%}, one beautiful daughter, {%Guṇakeśī%}. As he
found no suitable husband for her amongst D., Dai., G., or
men and Ṛ., {%Mātali%} set out for the {%Nāgaloka%} (V, {@97@}). On
the way {%Nārada%}, proceeding to visit {%Varuṇa%}, followed {%Mātali%},
and first showed him the abode of {%Varuṇa%}, surrounded by his
sons and grandsons. {%Varuṇa's%} son {%Puṣkara%} had been chosen
as husband by {%Soma's%} daughter {%Jyotsnākālī%} (who had [before]
chosen (so PCR.) the eldest and foremost of {%Aditi's%} sons (i.e.
Sūrya, Nīl.)). He then showed him the abode, entirely made
of gold, of the liquor ({%Vāruṇyaṃ%}): to the possession of that
liquor ({%surā%}) the gods owe their being {%Surāḥ%}. He showed
him also the weapons that had belonged to the {%Daityas%} and
had been obtained by the gods as a booty of war; when
hurled at the foe they always return into the hand that
hurls them. Here dwelt in days of yore many tribes of Rā.
and Dai. Here is that fire of blazing flames and the discus
of {%Viṣṇu%}; and that knotty bow that was created for the
destruction of the world; it is always protected with great
vigilance by the gods, and it is from this bow that the one
wielded by {%Arjuna%} has taken its name; it is endued with
the strength of 100,000 bows; it punishes all wicked ({%rakṣo-%}
{%bandhuṣu%}) kings; it was first created by {%Brahmán%} and praised
by {%Śukra%} (B. {%Cakreṇa%}); it is held by the sons of the Lord of
waters. He showed him also {%Varuṇa's%} umbrella in the
umbrella-house, always dropping water that cannot be seen.
Innumerable are the wonders to be seen here (V. {@98@}). In
the very centre of the {%Nāgaloka%} is the city {%Pātāla%} with
{%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas%}, the {%Asura%} fire, fed by water; here
the gods, having first vanquished their foes, quaffed the
{%amṛta%} and deposited the residue; the {%Āditya Hayaśiras%};
from here {%Airāvata%} takes up water in order to impart it to
the clouds, and it is that water which {%Indra%} pours down
as rain; aquatic animals, the {%timi%}, etc., which subsist on the
rays of the moon; here {%Mahādeva%} practised ascetic austerities
for the benefit of all creatures; {%maharṣis%} addicted to the vow
of {%go (govratinaḥ%}); here in the race of the celebrated elephant
{%Supratīka%} were born the elephants {%Airāvaṇa%} (the king of his
tribe), {%Vāmana, Kumuda%}, and {%Añjana%}; an egg in the waters
from the commencement of the creation, whence, when the
end of the world comes, a fire bursts forth and consumes
the three worlds, etc. {%Mātali%} said: “No one here seems to
be eligible” (V, {@99@}). In {%Pātāla%} is {%Hiraṇyapura%}, built by
the {%Dānava%} (so PCR.; B. and C. {%Viśvakarmaṇā%}) {%Maya%},
belonging to the {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas%}, who in days of yore
lived here having obtained boons, exhibiting 1,000 different
kinds of illusion, incapable of being vanquished by {%Śakra%},
{%Yama, Varuṇa%}, or {%Kubera%}, etc. The {%Kālakhañjas%} ({%Asuras%}, who
sprang from {%Viṣṇu(?%}), so PCR.: {%Asurāḥ Kālakhañjāś ca%}
{%tathā Viṣṇupadodbhavāḥ%}; C. {%Kālaka°%}) and the {%Yātudhānas%}
({%Rākṣasas%}, who sprang from the feet of {%Brahmán(?%}), so
PCR.: {%Nairṛtā Yātudhānāś ca Brahmapadodbhavāś ca ye%})
(description); the {%Nivātakavacas (Dānavas%}); “many times,
[Page473-a+ 63]
O {%Mātali!%} thou with thy son {%Gomukha%} and {%Indra%} hadst to
retreat before them”; description of their abodes (the gems
{%arkasphaṭika, vajrasāra, padmarāga%}, etc.). {%Mātali%} would not
choose a son-in-law among the {%Dānavas%}, the enemies of the
gods; “as regards thyself (i.e. Nārada), I know that thy
heart is ever set on fomenting quarrels ({%hiṃsātmakaṃ%})”
(V, {@100@}). Then the world of the {%Suparṇas%}, who subsist on
snakes and have sprung from the six sons of {%Garuḍa%}:
{%Sumukha%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), of {%Kaśyapa's%} and {%Vinatā's%} race, adorned
with the {%Śrīvatsa%}, belonging to the {%kṣatriya%} order, for they
never attain to brahmanhood ({%brāhmaṇyaṃ%}) in consequence
of their preying upon their kinsmen; they are shown favour
by {%Viṣṇu%}, and adore {%Viṣṇu%}. The names of the principal
are: {%Suvarṇacūḍa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) (V, {@101@}). {%Rasātala%} is the
seventh stratum below the earth; here dwells {%Surabhī%}, the
mother of kine, born of the {%amṛta%}; her milk springs from
the essence of the six different kinds of tastes; she sprang of
old from the mouth of {%Brahmán%}, who was gratified with
drinking the {%amṛta%} and vomited the best of things (i.e. the
cow and the brahman, PCR.). A jet of her milk created the
Milky Ocean ({%kṣīranidhi%}), covered with white foam that is
the food of the ascetics ({%munisattamāḥ) Phenapāḥ%} (“Foam-
drinkers”); the very gods fear them because of their
austerities. From {%Surabhī%} are born the four kine that support
the quarters ({%diśāṃ pālyaḥ%}): in the East {%Surūpā%}, in the South
{%Haṃsikā%}, in the West {%Subhadrā%}, in the North ({%dharmyām%}
{%Ailavilasañjñitāṃ) Sarvakāmadughā%}. The gods and the
{%Asuras%}, making {%Mandara%} their pole, churned the Ocean,
and obtained {%Vāruṇī, Lakṣmī, amṛta, Uccaiḥśravas%}, and
{%Kaustubha. Surabhī%} milks {%sudhā%} to those who live on {%sudhā%}
(i.e. the Nāgas, PCR.), {%svadhā%} to those who live on {%svadhā%}
(i.e. the Pitṛs, PCR.), and {%amṛta%} to those who live on
{%amṛta%} (i.e. the gods, PCR.). The {%gāthā%} that was sung by
the dwellers of {%Rasātala%} in days of old is still heard to be
recited in the world by persons of learning: “Neither in the
{%Nāga-loka%}, nor in {%Svarga%}, nor in a {%vimāna%}, nor in heaven
({%Tripiṣṭape%}) is residence so happy as in {%Rasātala%}” (V, {@102@}).
The city of {%Bhogavatī%} resembles {%Indra's%} city {%Amarāvatī%}; it
is ruled over by {%Vāsuki%}, the king of the {%Nāgas%}; here dwells
{%Śeṣa (b%}); here dwell the innumerable {%Nāgas%} (description),
the sons of {%Surasā%}, wearing {%svastika%}, etc. The principal
are {%Vāsuki%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Mātali%} wished to get for his son-in-law
the {%Nāga Sumukha%} of {%Airāvata's%} race, the son of {%Cikura%}
(who had been not long before slain by {%Garuḍa%}), and the
grandson of {%Āryaka Kauravya%} and the daughter's son of
{%Vāmana%} (V, {@103@}). {%Nārada%} introduced {%Mātali%} to {%Āryaka%}
as the friend and charioteer of {%Indra%}, who drives his chariot
drawn by 1,000 steeds, and thereby has vanquished the
enemies of the gods. {%Āryaka%} objected that {%Garuḍa%}, who
had slain {%Cikura%}, when he left these regions had said that
after a month he would devour {%Sumukha%} also. According
to a proposal of {%Mātali%}, they all visited {%Indra%} and {%Viṣṇu%};
{%Viṣṇu%} proposed to give {%amṛta%} to {%Sumukha%}; but {%Indra%}
disagreed on account of the prowess of {%Garuḍa%}; instead
he gave him an excellent lease of life, and having married
{%Mātali's%} daughter he returned home (V, {@104@}). {%Garuḍa%}
made remonstrances to {%Indra%}, saying that he, like him, can
without any fatigue bear the weight of the three worlds;
that he had slain the {%Daityas Śrutaśrī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>); that he
not only perches on {%Viṣṇu's%} flagstaff, but sometimes carries
him with all his friends on his back, and he can carry {%Viṣṇu%}
without fatigue on only one of his feathers. {%Viṣṇu%} shows
him that he cannot bear the weight of his one right arm;
[Page473-b+ 63]
then he threw {%Sumukha%} with the toe of his foot upon {%Garuḍa's%}
breast. And from that time {%Garuḍa%} has ever lived (in
friendship?) with that snake. {%Kaṇva%} continued: “In the
same way, O {%Duryodhana!%} thou canst not encounter {%Bhīma%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>).” {%Duryodhana%}, fixing his eyes on {%Karṇa%}, burst
into laughter, saying: “I am precisely what the creator has
made me” (V, {@105@}).
