[{@Mātalīyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Mātali”). (Cf. Mātalīyam upākhyānaṃ.) § 564 (Bhaga-
<div n="lb">vady.). The holy {%Ṛṣi (bhagavān ṛṣiḥ) Kaṇva%} said to
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} in the assembly of the {%Kurus: Brahmán,%} the
<div n="lb">grandsire of the universe {%(Lokapitāmahaḥ),%} is indestructible
<div n="lb">and eternal. The holy {%Ṛṣis (bhagavantāv ṛṣī) Nara%} and
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} are of the same character. Of all the sons of
<div n="lb">{%Aditi, Viṣṇu%} alone is eternal…In this connection is
<div n="lb">cited an old story: {%Mātali,%} the charioteer of {%Indra,%} had, by
<div n="lb">his wife {%Sudharmā,%} one beautiful daughter, {%Guṇakeśī.%} As he
<div n="lb">found no suitable husband for her amongst D., Dai., G., or
<div n="lb">men and Ṛ., {%Mātali%} set out for the {%Nāgaloka%} (V, {@97@}). On
<div n="lb">the way {%Nārada,%} proceeding to visit {%Varuṇa,%} followed {%Mātali,%}
<div n="lb">and first showed him the abode of {%Varuṇa,%} surrounded by his
<div n="lb">sons and grandsons. {%Varuṇa's%} son {%Puṣkara%} had been chosen
<div n="lb">as husband by {%Soma's%} daughter {%Jyotsnākālī%} (who had [before]
<div n="lb">chosen (so PCR.) the eldest and foremost of {%Aditi's%} sons (i.e.
<div n="lb">Sūrya, Nīl.)). He then showed him the abode, entirely made
<div n="lb">of gold, of the liquor {%(Vāruṇyaṃ):%} to the possession of that
<div n="lb">liquor {%(surā)%} the gods owe their being {%Surāḥ.%} He showed
<div n="lb">him also the weapons that had belonged to the {%Daityas%} and
<div n="lb">had been obtained by the gods as a booty of war; when
<div n="lb">hurled at the foe they always return into the hand that
<div n="lb">hurls them. Here dwelt in days of yore many tribes of Rā.
<div n="lb">and Dai. Here is that fire of blazing flames and the discus
<div n="lb">of {%Viṣṇu;%} and that knotty bow that was created for the
<div n="lb">destruction of the world; it is always protected with great
<div n="lb">vigilance by the gods, and it is from this bow that the one
<div n="lb">wielded by {%Arjuna%} has taken its name; it is endued with
<div n="lb">the strength of 100,000 bows; it punishes all wicked {%(rakṣo-%}
<div n="lb">{%bandhuṣu)%} kings; it was first created by {%Brahmán%} and praised
<div n="lb">by {%Śukra%} (B. {%Cakreṇa%}); it is held by the sons of the Lord of
<div n="lb">waters. He showed him also {%Varuṇa's%} umbrella in the
<div n="lb">umbrella-house, always dropping water that cannot be seen.
<div n="lb">Innumerable are the wonders to be seen here (V. {@98@}). In
<div n="lb">the very centre of the {%Nāgaloka%} is the city {%Pātāla%} with
<div n="lb">{%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas,%} the {%Asura%} fire, fed by water; here
<div n="lb">the gods, having first vanquished their foes, quaffed the
<div n="lb">{%amṛta%} and deposited the residue; the {%Āditya Hayaśiras;%}
<div n="lb">from here {%Airāvata%} takes up water in order to impart it to
<div n="lb">the clouds, and it is that water which {%Indra%} pours down
<div n="lb">as rain; aquatic animals, the {%timi,%} etc., which subsist on the
<div n="lb">rays of the moon; here {%Mahādeva%} practised ascetic austerities
<div n="lb">for the benefit of all creatures; {%maharṣis%} addicted to the vow
<div n="lb">of {%go (govratinaḥ);%} here in the race of the celebrated elephant
<div n="lb">{%Supratīka%} were born the elephants {%Airāvaṇa%} (the king of his
<div n="lb">tribe), {%Vāmana, Kumuda,%} and {%Añjana;%} an egg in the waters
<div n="lb">from the commencement of the creation, whence, when the
<div n="lb">end of the world comes, a fire bursts forth and consumes
<div n="lb">the three worlds, etc. {%Mātali%} said: “No one here seems to
<div n="lb">be eligible” (V, {@99@}). In {%Pātāla%} is {%Hiraṇyapura,%} built by
<div n="lb">the {%Dānava%} (so PCR.; B. and C. {%Viśvakarmaṇā%}) {%Maya,%}
<div n="lb">belonging to the {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas,%} who in days of yore
<div n="lb">lived here having obtained boons, exhibiting 1,000 different
<div n="lb">kinds of illusion, incapable of being vanquished by {%Śakra,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yama, Varuṇa,%} or {%Kubera,%} etc. The {%Kālakhañjas%} ({%Asuras,%} who
<div n="lb">sprang from {%Viṣṇu(?),%} so PCR.: {%Asurāḥ Kālakhañjāś ca%}
<div n="lb">{%tathā Viṣṇupadodbhavāḥ;%} C. {%Kālaka°%}) and the {%Yātudhānas%}
<div n="lb">({%Rākṣasas,%} who sprang from the feet of {%Brahmán(?),%} so
<div n="lb">PCR.: {%Nairṛtā Yātudhānāś ca Brahmapadodbhavāś ca ye%})
<div n="lb">(description); the {%Nivātakavacas (Dānavas);%} “many times,
[Page473-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">O {%Mātali!%} thou with thy son {%Gomukha%} and {%Indra%} hadst to
<div n="lb">retreat before them”; description of their abodes (the gems
<div n="lb">{%arkasphaṭika, vajrasāra, padmarāga,%} etc.). {%Mātali%} would not
<div n="lb">choose a son-in-law among the {%Dānavas,%} the enemies of the
<div n="lb">gods; “as regards thyself (i.e. Nārada), I know that thy
<div n="lb">heart is ever set on fomenting quarrels {%(hiṃsātmakaṃ)%}”
<div n="lb">(V, {@100@}). Then the world of the {%Suparṇas,%} who subsist on
<div n="lb">snakes and have sprung from the six sons of {%Garuḍa:%}
<div n="lb">{%Sumukha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), of {%Kaśyapa's%} and {%Vinatā's%} race, adorned
<div n="lb">with the {%Śrīvatsa,%} belonging to the {%kṣatriya%} order, for they
<div n="lb">never attain to brahmanhood {%(brāhmaṇyaṃ)%} in consequence
<div n="lb">of their preying upon their kinsmen; they are shown favour
<div n="lb">by {%Viṣṇu,%} and adore {%Viṣṇu.%} The names of the principal
<div n="lb">are: {%Suvarṇacūḍa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (V, {@101@}). {%Rasātala%} is the
<div n="lb">seventh stratum below the earth; here dwells {%Surabhī,%} the
<div n="lb">mother of kine, born of the {%amṛta;%} her milk springs from
<div n="lb">the essence of the six different kinds of tastes; she sprang of
<div n="lb">old from the mouth of {%Brahmán,%} who was gratified with
<div n="lb">drinking the {%amṛta%} and vomited the best of things (i.e. the
<div n="lb">cow and the brahman, PCR.). A jet of her milk created the
<div n="lb">Milky Ocean {%(kṣīranidhi),%} covered with white foam that is
<div n="lb">the food of the ascetics {%(munisattamāḥ) Phenapāḥ%} (“Foam-
<div n="lb">drinkers”); the very gods fear them because of their
<div n="lb">austerities. From {%Surabhī%} are born the four kine that support
<div n="lb">the quarters {%(diśāṃ pālyaḥ):%} in the East {%Surūpā,%} in the South
<div n="lb">{%Haṃsikā,%} in the West {%Subhadrā,%} in the North {%(dharmyām%}
<div n="lb">{%Ailavilasañjñitāṃ) Sarvakāmadughā.%} The gods and the
<div n="lb">{%Asuras,%} making {%Mandara%} their pole, churned the Ocean,
<div n="lb">and obtained {%Vāruṇī, Lakṣmī, amṛta, Uccaiḥśravas,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kaustubha. Surabhī%} milks {%sudhā%} to those who live on {%sudhā%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. the Nāgas, PCR.), {%svadhā%} to those who live on {%svadhā%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. the Pitṛs, PCR.), and {%amṛta%} to those who live on
<div n="lb">{%amṛta%} (i.e. the gods, PCR.). The {%gāthā%} that was sung by
<div n="lb">the dwellers of {%Rasātala%} in days of old is still heard to be
<div n="lb">recited in the world by persons of learning: “Neither in the
<div n="lb">{%Nāga-loka,%} nor in {%Svarga,%} nor in a {%vimāna,%} nor in heaven
<div n="lb">{%(Tripiṣṭape)%} is residence so happy as in {%Rasātala%}” (V, {@102@}).
<div n="lb">The city of {%Bhogavatī%} resembles {%Indra's%} city {%Amarāvatī;%} it
<div n="lb">is ruled over by {%Vāsuki,%} the king of the {%Nāgas;%} here dwells
<div n="lb">{%Śeṣa (b);%} here dwell the innumerable {%Nāgas%} (description),
<div n="lb">the sons of {%Surasā,%} wearing {%svastika,%} etc. The principal
<div n="lb">are {%Vāsuki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Mātali%} wished to get for his son-in-law
<div n="lb">the {%Nāga Sumukha%} of {%Airāvata's%} race, the son of {%Cikura%}
<div n="lb">(who had been not long before slain by {%Garuḍa%}), and the
<div n="lb">grandson of {%Āryaka Kauravya%} and the daughter's son of
<div n="lb">{%Vāmana%} (V, {@103@}). {%Nārada%} introduced {%Mātali%} to {%Āryaka%}
<div n="lb">as the friend and charioteer of {%Indra,%} who drives his chariot
<div n="lb">drawn by 1,000 steeds, and thereby has vanquished the
<div n="lb">enemies of the gods. {%Āryaka%} objected that {%Garuḍa,%} who
<div n="lb">had slain {%Cikura,%} when he left these regions had said that
<div n="lb">after a month he would devour {%Sumukha%} also. According
<div n="lb">to a proposal of {%Mātali,%} they all visited {%Indra%} and {%Viṣṇu;%}
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu%} proposed to give {%amṛta%} to {%Sumukha;%} but {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">disagreed on account of the prowess of {%Garuḍa;%} instead
<div n="lb">he gave him an excellent lease of life, and having married
<div n="lb">{%Mātali's%} daughter he returned home (V, {@104@}). {%Garuḍa%}
<div n="lb">made remonstrances to {%Indra,%} saying that he, like him, can
<div n="lb">without any fatigue bear the weight of the three worlds;
<div n="lb">that he had slain the {%Daityas Śrutaśrī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); that he
<div n="lb">not only perches on {%Viṣṇu's%} flagstaff, but sometimes carries
<div n="lb">him with all his friends on his back, and he can carry {%Viṣṇu%}
<div n="lb">without fatigue on only one of his feathers. {%Viṣṇu%} shows
<div n="lb">him that he cannot bear the weight of his one right arm;
[Page473-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">then he threw {%Sumukha%} with the toe of his foot upon {%Garuḍa's%}
<div n="lb">breast. And from that time {%Garuḍa%} has ever lived (in
<div n="lb">friendship?) with that snake. {%Kaṇva%} continued: “In the
<div n="lb">same way, O {%Duryodhana!%} thou canst not encounter {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).” {%Duryodhana,%} fixing his eyes on {%Karṇa,%} burst
<div n="lb">into laughter, saying: “I am precisely what the creator has
<div n="lb">made me” (V, {@105@}).
