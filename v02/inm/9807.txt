[{@Sauptikaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section including the
nightly attack”: ({%a%}) the 10th of the greater parvans of
Mhbhr., including the 83rd and the 84th of the minor
parvans; ({%b%}) the 83rd of the minor parvans; cf. Sauptika):
§ 616: {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. proceeded towards the south. At
the hour of sunset they reached a spot near the encampment.
Hearing the shouts in the {%Pāṇḍava%} camp, they proceeded
farther and reached a dense forest. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} interrupted
{%Sañjaya%} by expressing his grief for {%Duryodhana%}, and then
inquired about the acts of the three survivors (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Sañjaya%}
continued: {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc., laid themselves down for rest
under a huge banyan; {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} fell asleep;
[Page634-a+ 63]
{%Aśvatthāman%} was kept awake by wrath and the desire of
vengeance. He saw a fierce owl coming to that banyan and
slaying a large number of crows roosting on its branches; at this
sight he formed the resolution of slaying the {%Pāṇḍava%} army
while buried in sleep; he roused {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%},
unfolded his project before them, and asked for their advice
(X, {@1@}); {%Kṛpa%} dissuaded him from executing his wicked
design; “Let us repair to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī%}, and
{%Vidura%}, and ask them as to what we should do” (X, {@2@});
{%Aśvatthāman%} tried to refute {%Kṛpa's%} arguments (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) (X, {@3@}).
{%Kṛpa%} promised to aid {%Aśvatthāman%} if the latter would fight
the foe the next morning during daylight (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); {%Aśvatthāman's%}
answer: he would not desist (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (X, {@4@}). {%Kṛpa%} earnestly
remonstrated with {%Aśvatthāman%}, who declared his resolution
to be unaltered (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), yoked his steeds to his chariot, and
proceeded alone, saying that he would avenge his father
(<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} followed him. Approaching the
{%Pāṇḍava%} camp, {%Aśvatthāman%} stopped at the gate (X, {@5@}).
He beheld a being of gigantic frame (description; hundreds
and thousands of {%Hṛṣīkeśas%} issued from its flames) ready to
resist him, and fearlessly fought it; it devoured all the
weapons of {%Aśvatthāman%}, who repented of his rash deed, and
resolved to seek the protection of {%Mahādeva%} (X, {@6@}), to whom
he recited a hymn (<lang n="greek">η</lang>). A golden altar appeared before him
with a blazing fire on it; many mighty beings of extra-
ordinary appearance came there (description), worshippers of
{%Mahādeva. Aśvatthāman%} felt no fear at the sight; he offered
himself to {%Mahādeva%} as a libation on the fire; {%Mahādeva%}
appeared and declared that the period of life of everybody in
the camp had ran out; he gave a sword to {%Aśvatthāman%} and
filled him with his own energy; many invisible beings and
Rā. proceeded to his right and left as he set out (X, {@7@}).
He asked {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} to stand at the gate and
slay everybody who would seek to escape; he entered the
{%Pāṇḍava%} camp like a thief and slew {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>)
(description; he employed the {%Rudra%} weapon); Rā. uttered
loud roars in joy; also Y. came there; {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%}
set fire to the {%Pāṇḍava%} camp in three places; “{%Arjuna%} is
incapable of being vanquished by D., As., G., Y., and Rā.”
Before midnight the vast host of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} was slain by
{%Aśvatthāman%}; the camp was invaded by Rā. and Pś. that
gorge upon blood and flesh. {%Aśvatthāman%} forgot his grief for
his father; when morning dawned he issued from the camp
and joined {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked why
{%Aśvatthāman%} did not achieve such a feat before; {%Sañjaya%}
answered that the absence of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with {%Kṛṣṇa%}, as
also the sleep, was the cause of {%Aśvatthāman's%} success. They
congratulated each other and resolved to give notice of
the slaughter to {%Duryodhana%} (X, {@8@}). They beheld {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} still living, surrounded by wolves, hyenas, etc. They
lamented and informed him (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>); {%Aśvatthāman%} asked him,
when he came to heaven, to inform {%Droṇa%} and embrace
{%Bāhlīka%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), and informed him who were yet alive (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>)
and who had been slain (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>). {%Duryodhana%} regained his senses
and praised {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>). Saying “we shall all
meet again in heaven”, he gave up his life-breaths; his soul
ascended to heaven. At early dawn {%Sañjaya%} came to the
city and lost his spiritual sight. {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc., ascended
their chariots. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} breathed long and hot sighs
(X, {@9@}).
