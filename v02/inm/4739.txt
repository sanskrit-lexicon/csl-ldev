§ 395: At this time (cf. Arjuna Kārtavīrya, § 394), while
{%Gādhi%}, the king of {%Kānyakubja%}, was dwelling in the wood,
there was born to him a beautiful daughter, {%Satyavatī%}, whom
{%Ṛcīka Bhārgava%} asked in marriage. {%Gādhi%} said that, according
to a family custom, the bridegroom must give a dowry of 1,000
brown steeds with a single sable ear each (so PCR. translates
{%ekataḥ śyāmakarṇāṇāṃ%}, cf. V, 3740, and Gālavacarita). {%Ṛcīka%}
obtained them from {%Varuṇa%} (the spot where the horses ap-
peared was thence named Aśvatīrtha) and married {%Satyavatī%}
in {%Kānyakubja%} on the {%Gaṅgā%}, the very gods being companions
of the bridegroom ({%janyāḥ%}). Then his father {%Bhṛgu%} came
to see him and his wife, and being pleased with {%Satyavatī%},
granted her the boon that a son should be born to herself and
to her mother, telling her that during their season they should
embrace, her mother an {%aśvattha%} tree and herself an {%udumbara%}
tree, and eat two pots of rice and milk ({%caru%}) which he had
prepared, having ransacked the whole universe. Then {%Bhṛgu%}
disappeared. They, however, made an interchange both of
the pots and of the trees which they embraced. Knowing
this by his divine knowledge, {%Bhṛgu%} came once more and told
{%Satyavatī%} that she had been deluded by her mother, and that
therefore she would give birth to a brahman of kṣatriya
character ({%kṣatravṛttiḥ%}) and her mother to a kṣatriya
of brahman character ({%brāhmaṇācāraḥ%}). At her repeated
entreaties, however, he granted her that not her son but her
grandson should be of that description. The son of {%Satyavatī%}
was {%J.%}, who excelled many ṛṣis in Vedic lore ({%Vedādhyayanena%}),
and to whom the whole Dhanurveda appeared spontaneously
({%pratyabhāt%}), and likewise the four kinds of weapon ({%astrāṇi%}):
III, {@115@}, 10167.—§ 396: {%J%}. devoted himself to the study of
the {%Veda%} and to penances. He married {%Reṇukā%}, the daughter
of king {%Prasenajit%}, and lived with her in his hermitage
practising austerities. She gave birth to five sons, of whom
{%Rāma%} was the youngest. Once when {%Reṇukā%} had been
filled with desire, seeing the {%Mārttikāvata%} king {%Citraratha%}
bathing, together with his wife, {%J%}. ordered his sons {%Rumaṇvat%}
the eldest), {%Suṣeṇa, Vasu%}, and {%Viśvāvasu%} to kill their
mother, but as they refused to do so he cursed them, so that
they lost their senses and behaved like beasts and birds.
Then he ordered {%Rāma%} to do it, and he immediately severed
her head with an axe, and then prevailed upon {%J%}. to grant him
that {%Reṇukā%} might be restored to life and not remember that
she had been slain, that he himself might not be affected by
this sin, that his brothers might recover their former state,
and that he himself might be unrivalled on the field of battle
and obtain a long life: III, {@116@}, 10183, 10185, 10188.—
§ 397: Once when the sons of {%J%}. had gone out, {%Arjuna%}
{%Kārtavīrya%}, the lord of the country near the seashore
({%Anūpapatiḥ%}), came to the hermitage, and, though he was
praised by {%Reṇukā%}, he carried away the calf of the {%homadhenu%}
and pulled down the trees. {%J%}. told this to {%Rāma%}, who then
rushed towards {%Arjuna%} and cut down his 1,000 arms with his
arrows and at last killed him. Then the sons of {%Arjuna%} came
while {%Rāma%} was away, and with their arrows killed {%J.%}, who
did not fight, but repeatedly shouted the name of {%Rāma%}. When
they had gone away, {%Rāma%} returned to the hermitage: III,

entered the vessel of milk, desirous of putting {%J%}. to the test,
and spoiled the milk. {%J%}. was not enraged. {%Krodha%}, in the
form of a brahman lady, then said to him that the saying was
false that the {%Bhṛgus%} were wrathful, since he had been subdued
by {%J.%}, and asked his forgiveness. {%J%}. said that as the milk
had been destined to the {%Pitṛs, Krodha%} ought to introduce
himself to them. Through the curse of the {%Pitṛs, Krodha%}
became a mungoose until he had spoken disrespectfully of
{%Dharma%}. Then he wandered about to sacrifices and other
sacred places, employed in censuring great sacrifices, until he
came and censured the horse-sacrifice of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who
was {%Dharma's%} self; then he became freed from his curse:
