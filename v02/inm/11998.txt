{@Vidulāputraśāsana(ṃ)@}¦ (“Vidulā's instruction of her
<div n="lb">son”). § 10 (Parvas.): I, {@2,@} 333.—§ 568 (Bhagavady.):
<div n="lb">The princess {%Vidulā%} one day rebuked her son {%Sañjaya,%} who,
<div n="lb">being defeated by the king of the {%Sindhus,%} was lying
<div n="lb">dejected. “Without wrath, as thou art, thou canst not be
<div n="lb">counted as a man…It is better to blaze up for a moment
<div n="lb">than to smoke for a long time…He who has not achieved
<div n="lb">a great feat, forming the subject of men's conversation, only
<div n="lb">increases the number of men; he is neither man nor woman
<div n="lb">…It behoves thee not to adopt the idle, wretched,
<div n="lb">infamous, and miserable profession of mendicancy that is
<div n="lb">worthy only of a coward…He is a man who cherishes
<div n="lb">wrath and does not forgive…(V, {@133@})…The followers
<div n="lb">of the {%Sindhu%}-king are all discontented and waiting for the
<div n="lb">distress of their master; others will come to thee with their
<div n="lb">auxiliaries if they behold thee put forth thy prowess…
<div n="lb">While thou wert a child, a brahman said: ‘this one, falling
<div n="lb">into great distress, will again win greatness.’ {%Śambara%} has
<div n="lb">said ‘there is not a more miserable state than that in which
<div n="lb">one does not see how to procure his food from day to day’.
<div n="lb">By slaying {%Vṛtra, Indra%} became {%Mahendra%} (“the great
<div n="lb">Indra”), and obtained the {%soṃa%}-cup of Mahendra (v. 4562,
<div n="lb">B.: {%Māhendraṃ ca grahaṃ lebhe%}), and the lordship of all the
<div n="lb">worlds…Sovereignty is either the door of heaven or
<div n="lb">{%amṛta…%} In the possession of wealth, rejoice, as before,
<div n="lb">with the {%Sauvīra%}-maidens, and be not ruled over by the
<div n="lb">{%Saindhava%}-maidens…Handed down by tradition from
<div n="lb">time immemorial, the eternal essence of {%kṣatriya%}-virtues
<div n="lb">{%(kṣatrahṛdayaṃ)%} has been ordained by {%Prajāpati%} himself…
<div n="lb">A {%kṣatriya%} should rather break than yield. He should bow
<div n="lb">down to {%brahmans%} only and to virtue {%(dharmāya);%} he should
<div n="lb">rule over all other orders, destroying all evil-doers” (V. {@134@}).
<div n="lb">The son complained that the heart of his mother was made
<div n="lb">of steel, and blamed the {%kṣatriya%}-practices. {%Vidulā%} said that
<div n="lb">if {%Sañjaya%} was about to be stained by infamy and she did not
<div n="lb">say it to him, her affection for him would be like that of a
<div n="lb">she-ass for her young. He ought to have recourse to virtue
<div n="lb">and profit (V, {@135@})…“We have many treasure-houses
<div n="lb">unknown to thee…thou hast also more than one friend.”
<div n="lb">Despair left {%Sañjaya's%} heart, though he was not gifted
<div n="lb">with great intelligence. He roused himself and achieved all
<div n="lb">that his mother had pointed out. Indeed, this history,
<div n="lb">named {%Jaya,%} should be listened to by everyone desirous of
<div n="lb">victory, etc. (V, {@136@}).
