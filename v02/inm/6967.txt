[{@Maitreya-śāpa(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the curse of Maitreya”). § 315
<div n="lb">(Āraṇyak.). {%Vyāsa%} said that the {%ṛṣi Maitreya%} would ad-
<div n="lb">monish {%Duryodhana. Maitreya%} came, having on a {%tīrthayātrā%}
<div n="lb">arrived at {%Kurujāṅgala,%} and having visited {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">in the {%Kāmyaka%} wood. As {%Maitreya%} advised {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">to make peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas%} now that {%Bhīma%} had slain
<div n="lb">{%Kirmīra,%} etc., {%Duryodhana%} gave him a slight by slapping
<div n="lb">his thigh and scratching the ground with his foot. Therefore
<div n="lb">{%Maitreya%} cursed him, saying that {%Bhīma%} should smash that
<div n="lb">thigh of his with his mace; this curse, however, should not
<div n="lb">take effect if he made peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">wished to hear about the death of {%Kirmīra,%} but {%Maitreya%}
<div n="lb">would not speak again to him, because his words were not
<div n="lb">regarded by {%Duryodhana;%} saying that {%Vidura%} would relate
<div n="lb">it to him, he went away. {%Duryodhana%} went out perturbed.
