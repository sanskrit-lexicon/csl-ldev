{@Aśvamedhika(ṃ) parva(n)@}¦ (“the section treating of the
Horse-sacrifice,” the 93rd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
cf. Āśvamedhika(ṃ) parva(n)). § 778: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said
(XIV, 1): After {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had offered libations of water
[to Bhīṣma], {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} fell down in grief on the bank of
{%Gaṅgā%}. Incited by {%Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma%} took him up, surrounded
by the {%Pāṇḍavas; Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} comforts him, saying that it
is he and {%Gāndhārī%} who ought to grieve, and referring to
{%Vidura's%} advice about abandoning {%Duryodhana%} and his
warnings against {%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni%} (XIV, 1). {%Kṛṣṇa%} also
exhorts him, referring to the duties of the {%kṣattriyas%} expounded
by {%Bhīṣma, Vyāsa, Nārada%}, and {%Vidura. Yudhiṣṭhira%} cannot
forget the slaughter of {%Karṇa. Vyāsa%} also comforts him
(XIV, {@2@}), and reminding him that D. and As. perform
sacrifices, and that by sacrifices D. vanquished Dā., he urged
him to perform the {%Rājasūya%}, the Horse-sacrifice, the {%Sarva-%}
{%medha%}, and the {%Naramedha%}; [especially] the Horse-sacrifice
after the example of {%Rāma Dāśarathi%} and {%Bharata Dauṣmanti%},
[Page008-b+ 63]
and indicated to him a spot in the {%Himavat%}, where there
was gold in abundance, left behind by the brahmans at the
sacrifice of {%Marutta%} of the {%Karandhama%} race. Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} told the history of {%Marutta%} (XIV, {@3@})
** i.e. <is>Saṃvartta-Maruttīya</is> ({%b). Vaiśampāyana%} said:
† {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was delighted at hearing the speech of {%Vyāsa%},
and desirous of performing his sacrifices with those riches,
he consulted with his ministers (XIV, {@4—10@}).—§ 779:
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: When {%Vyāsa%} had concluded his speech,
{%Kṛṣṇa%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, saying that {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
{%karman%} has not yet been annihilated, nor had his foes been
subjugated—“How canst thou be ignorant of the enemies in
thy own flesh?”—and related the history of {%Indra's%} war with
<is>Vṛtra</is> ({%b%}) (XIV, {@11@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} then expounds that, as
physical ailments and health depend on the distribution of
the cold, warm, and windy [humours] of the body, so do the
mental ailments and health depend on {%sattva, rajas%}, and {%tamas%}
in the soul [mind]; happiness is overcome by sorrow, and
sorrow by pleasure; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should not recall his past
sorrows: {%Kṛṣṇā%} in the assembly, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); “the time has
now come when thou must fight single-handed with thy
mind” (XIV, {@12@}); salvation is not attained by foregoing
external things; {%Mṛtyu%} (death) is [the thought] “mine,”
and the eternal {%Brāhman%} is [the thought] “not mine”; as
no creature is ever destroyed, {%ahiṃsā%} (absence of injury) may
exist even when one has pierced [a creature's] body, and
{%vice versa%}; († v. 339—341): † the {%yogin%} knows {%yoga%} to be the
perfect way, on account of the practices of his many former
births; quoting the old verses sung by {%Kāma%}: “no creature
is able to destroy me without [resorting to] the [proper]
methods [i.e. subjugation of all desires, practice of {%yoga%},
etc.]…” (XIV, {@13@}).—§ 780: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Thus
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was consoled, exhorted by {%Viṣṭaraśravas%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); and having again performed the obsequial rites for
his relatives, etc., he ruled the earth. He said to {%Vyāsa%},
{%Nārada%}, etc., that he would now perform the sacrifice, and
said that they would go to the {%Himālaya%} under the protection
of {%Vyāsa%} [to fetch the gold], according to the words of
{%Vyāsa%}, D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%}, and {%Devasthāna%}. Then M.-ṛ. took
leave of {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa%}, and {%Arjuna%}. A short time
passed away while they performed their purifications after
{%Bhīṣma's%} death, and gave large gifts to the brahmans as
{%śrāddha (aurddhvadehikaṃ%}) to the {%Kurus Bhīṣma, Karṇa%},
etc., accompanied by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and then they entered
the city of {%Hāstinapura%} (XIV, {@14@}).—§ 781: Asked by
{%Janamejaya%} what {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} did when the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
had reconquered and pacified their kingdom, {%Vaiśampāyana%}
said: When the {%Pāṇḍava%}-kingdom had been conquered and
pacified {%K%}. and {%A%}. travelled with great pleasure amidst
picturesque sceneries, like {%Indra%} and his wife (?, so PCR.)
({%deveśvarau%}) in heaven, or like the {%Aśvins%} in {%Nandana%}, and
[then] entered the palace of {%Indraprastha%} in great merriment,
reciting the genealogies of Ṛ. and gods, etc., and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
consoled {%Arjuna%} for the death of his relatives (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). It was
long since he had seen {%Vasudeva, Baladeva%}, and the {%Vṛṣṇi%}-
heroes; he, therefore, asked leave to go to {%Dvāravatī%}, and to
accompany him to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and apprise him of his
departure. († v. 404—6): {%Arjuna%} sorrowfully replied, “Be
it so” (XIV, {@15@}).
