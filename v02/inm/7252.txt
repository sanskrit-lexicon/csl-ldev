[{@Mausalaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the battle
with clubs,” the 16th of the great and the 98th of the
minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Mausala). § 793: {%Vaiśam-%}
{%pāyana%} said: When the 36th year [after the great battle]
was reached, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} beheld many unusual portents
(specification). A little while afterwards he heard of the
wholesale carnage of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} in a battle with clubs, where
only {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rāma%} had escaped with life; he summoned
his brothers and took counsel with them; they were filled
with grief; the death of {%Kṛṣṇa%} they could not believe.
{%Janamejaya%} inquired about the particulars of the destruction
of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas. Vaiśampāyana%} said: **When
the 36th year…(cf. above). Asked by {%Janamejaya%},
cursed by whom the {%Vṛṣṇis%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), met with destruction,
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Sāraṇa%}, etc., saw {%Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva%},
and {%Nārada%} arrived at {%Dvārakā%}; they disguised {%Śāmba%} as
a woman, calling her the wife of {%Babhru%}, and asked the
ascetics what [sort of child] this one would bring forth. The
ascetics answered: “This {%Śāmba%} will bring forth a terrible
iron club for the destruction of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%},
except {%Rāma%} (who will enter the ocean) and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (whom
{%Jarā%} will pierce while lying on the ground).” Then they
went to {%Kṛṣṇa%}. Informed of what had taken place, {%Kṛṣṇa%}
summoned all the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and told them of it, but did not
try to annul the curse. The next day {%Śāmba%} actually
brought forth an iron club. The fact was reported to the
king {%[Ugrasena]%}, who caused it to be reduced into powder
and thrown into the sea. At the command of {%Āhuka%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), the manufacture of spirits was forbidden among
all the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%}, under the penance of being
impaled alive with all one's kinsmen. All the citizens
(knowing that it was the command of Rāma also) bound
themselves by the rule (XVI, {@1@}). [The embodied form of]
Time every day wandered about their houses, like a man
of terrible and fierce aspect, bald head, black and tawny
of complexion; they shot innumerable arrows at him, without
being able to pierce him. Also other dreadful portents of
calamity were daily seen by the {%Vṛṣṇis%} throughout the city
(description). They showed disregard for brahmans, P., and
D., etc., except {%Rāma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. When the {%Pāñca-%}
{%janya%} was blown in their houses, asses brayed aloud from every
direction. {%Kṛṣṇa%}, seeing that the day of the new moon
coincided with the 13th [and 14th] lunation, summoned the
{%Yādavas%} and said: The 14th lunation has been made the
15th by {%Rāhu%} once more, as at the time of the great battle
[Page476-a+ 63]
of the {%Bharatas%} (v. the note of PCR. on p. 5). He understood
that the 36th year had come according to the curse of
{%Gāndhārī%}, and that the omens were similar to those which
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had noticed when the two armies were arrayed
in order of battle. He endeavoured to bring about those
occurrences which would make {%Gāndhārī's%} words true. He
commanded the {%Vṛṣṇis%} to make a pilgrimage to some sacred
water, and caused the messengers to proclaim a journey to
the sea-coast (XVI, {@2@}). At that time the {%Vṛṣṇi%} ladies
dreamt every night that a black woman with white teeth,
entering their abodes, laughed aloud and ran through {%Dvārakā%}
stealing [from them]; the men dreamt of vultures that
devoured the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%} in the houses and fire-
chambers; their ornaments, etc., were taken away by Rā.
The iron discus of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, given by {%Agni%}, with a nave of
adamant, ascended to heaven. {%Kṛṣṇa's%} chariot was dragged
away by his four steeds over the ocean; {%Kṛṣṇa's%} and {%Baladeva's%}
standards (resp. {%Garuḍa%} and a palmyra), which were reverently
worshipped by those two heroes, were taken away by Aps.,
who day and night called upon the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%} to
set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred water. They prepared
various kinds of edibles and spirits, and set out to {%Prabhāsa%}.
{%Uddhava%} took leave of them and {%Kṛṣṇa%} before departing
[from the world]. The {%Vṛṣṇis%}, mixing with spirits the food
that had been cooked for the brahmans, gave it to apes, and
began revels with drinking, so also {%Rāma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); {%Yuyu-%}
{%dhāna%} blamed {%Kṛtavarman%} for the nightly slaughter, and was
applauded by {%Pradyumna%}, but was rebuked by {%Kṛtavarman%}
with having killed {%Bhūriśravas%} while sitting in {%prāya; Kṛṣṇa%}
cast an angry glance [at {%Kṛtavarman%}], and {%Sātyaki%} informed
him of the story of the gem {%Syamantaka%}, which was {%Satrājit's%};
{%Satyabhāmā%}, weeping, approached {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and sitting on his
lap enhanced his anger; {%Sātyaki%} swore that he would cause
{%Kṛtavarman%} to follow the five sons of {%Draupadī%}, etc (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), whom
he had slain with the help of {%Aśvatthāman%}, and he severed his
head in the very sight of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and began to strike down
others; {%Kṛṣṇa%} rushed forward to prevent him from doing
further mischief, and the {%Bhojas%} and {%Andhakas%} all assailed
him; {%Kṛṣṇa%} did not interfere; they struck {%Yuyudhāna%} with
the pots from which they had been eating; {%Pradyumna%}
rushed forward to rescue {%Yuyudhāna%}; they were both slain.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} in wrath took up a handful of {%erakā%} grass, which
became a terrible iron club, with which {%Kṛṣṇa%} slew all
that came before him. The {%Andhakas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), also took up
blades of the {%erakā%} grass, which were converted into iron
clubs, and struck one another in consequence of the curse
of the brahmans; son killed father and vice versa, inebriated
with spirits. Beholding that {%Śāmba%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), were slain, {%Kṛṣṇa%}
exterminated the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and the {%Andhakas. Babhru%} and
{%Dāruka%} told him now to go to {%Rāma%} (XVI, {@3@}). {%Dāruka, Kṛṣṇa%},
and {%Babhru%}, seeking {%Rāma%}, saw him sitting thoughtfully,
reclining his back against a tree. {%Kṛṣṇa%} sent {%Dāruka%} to
inform {%Arjuna%} and tell him to come quickly, and he also
dispatched {%Babhru%} to protect the ladies against robbers; but
as soon as {%Babhru%} had proceeded to a distance, an iron club
attached to the mallet of a hunter came and slew him.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} then, entering {%Dvāravatī%}, told his father to protect
the ladies till {%Arjuna%} came, saying that he would practise
penances with {%Rāma%}. When he came to {%Rāma%}, the latter had
applied himself to {%yoga%}, and from his mouth issued a huge
white {%Nāga%} with 1,000 heads and red eyes, who proceeded to
the ocean, and was received by the ocean and many celestial
snakes (and many sacred rivers): {%Karkoṭaka%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>). After
[Page476-b+ 63]
{%Rāma's%} death {%Kṛṣṇa%} wandered for some time, and then sat
down, thinking of {%Gāndhārī%} (§ 619) and {%Durvāsas%} (§ 773{%c%}),
and the destruction of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas%}, and {%Kurus%},
whence he concluded that the hour [of his death] had come;
he then restrained his senses [in {%yoga%}]; though he was the
Supreme Deity, he wished to die in order to dispel all
doubts, etc., and to make the words of {%Durvāsas%} true. The
hunter {%Jarā%}, mistaking {%Kṛṣṇa%} for a deer, pierced him at
the heel with an arrow; coming up, he beheld a man dressed
in yellow robes, rapt in {%yoga%}, with many arms; he became
filled with fear; {%Kṛṣṇa%} comforted him and then ascended
upwards, and was received in heaven by {%Indra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>)
(XVI, {@4@}). Meanwhile {%Dāruka%} came and informed the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} of the slaughter of the {%Vṛṣṇis%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>). {%Arjuna%}
with {%Dāruka%} proceeded to {%Dvārakā%}; when {%Kṛṣṇa's%} 16,000
wives saw {%Arjuna%}, they uttered a loud cry; the city seemed
to {%Arjuna%} to be the fierce river {%Vaitaraṇī; Arjuna, Satyā%}
(the daughter of {%Satrājit%}), and {%Rukmiṇī%} fell down and wailed;
then praising {%Kṛṣṇa%} and comforting the ladies, {%Arjuna%} went
to {%Vasudeva%} (XVI, {@5@}), whom he found lying on the ground
and burning with grief; {%Vasudeva%} lamented (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>) and said he
would die by abstaining from food (XVI, {@6@}). {%Arjuna%} said
that the hour had come for the {%Pāṇḍavas%} also for departing
[from the world] (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>); he would, however, first remove to
{%Indraprastha%} the women, the children, and the aged of the
{%Vṛṣṇis%}. Saying to {%Dāruka%} that he wished to see the chief
officers of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Arjuna%} entered the hall of the
{%Yādavas%} called {%Sudharmā%}, where he said to the citizens and
ministers that he would take away with him the remnants
of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%}, as the sea would soon engulf
the city; {%Vajra%} would be their king at {%Indraprastha%}; they
would set out on the seventh day at sunrise. {%Arjuna%} passed
that night in the mansion of {%Kṛṣṇa%}. At dawn {%Vasudeva%} by
{%yoga%} attained to the highest goal; the ladies were in despair.
His four wives, {%Devakī, Bhadrā, Rohiṇī%}, and {%Madirā%}, ascended
the funeral pyre, and attained to the regions of {%Vasudeva%}.
When {%Arjuna%} had caused {%Vasudeva%} and his four wives to be
burnt (under immense tokens of sympathy from the women),
the boys (headed by {%Vajra%}) and the ladies offered oblations
of water to {%Vasudeva%}. Then {%Arjuna%} visited the spot where
the {%Vṛṣṇis%} had been killed and caused the last rites to be
performed, and caused {%Rāma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} to be cremated. On
the seventh day he set out, mounting his chariot, with the
ladies and children, the {%Yādava%} troops, and other inhabitants,
with {%Kṛṣṇa's%} 16,000 wives and {%Vajra%}; they numbered many
millions in all. Then the ocean flooded {%Dvārakā%}. They
proceeded in slow marches. When they had planted their
encampment at {%Pañcanada%}, the {%Ābhīras (Mlecchas%}) conspired
to rob the cavalcade. {%Arjuna%} succeeded only with great
difficulty in stringing his bow; his celestial weapons would
not come to his mind; the {%Vṛṣṇi%} warriors failed to rescue
the women, who were snatched away by the robbers; {%Arjuna's%}
shafts soon became exhausted; formerly they had been
inexhaustible. {%Arjuna%} became very cheerless; he escorted
the remnant of the cavalcade to {%Kurukṣetra%}; he established
the son of {%Kṛtavarman%} in the city of {%Mārttikāvata%} with the
remnant of the women of the {%Bhoja%} king; the remainder,
with children and old men and women, at {%Indraprastha%}, with
{%Vajra%} as their ruler; the son of {%Yuyudhāna%} (with old men,
etc.) on the banks of the {%Sarasvatī%}; the widows of {%Akrūra%},
notwithstanding the entreaties of {%Vajra%}, entered the woods;
{%Rukmiṇī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), ascended the funeral pyre; {%Satyabhāmā%}
and the other wives of {%Kṛṣṇa%} entered the woods in order
[Page477-a+ 63]
to practise penances in the contemplation of {%Hari%}; going
beyond {%Himavat%}, they took up their abode in {%Kalāpa-grāma%}.
Then {%Arjuna%} entered the retreat of {%Vyāsa%} (XVI, {@7@}). Asked
by {%Vyāsa%} (“Hast thou been sprinkled with water from
anybody's nails or hair, etc.?”), {%Arjuna%} informed him of
what had passed (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>) (“500,000 warriors have thus been laid
down”). {%Vyāsa%} said that the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%} had
been consumed by the brahman's curse; it was destiny:
“{%Kṛṣṇa%}, as also the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, have finished their work; the
time has come for your departure from the world,” etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>).
{%Arjuna%} entered {%Hāstinapura%} and informed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of
what had taken place (XVI, {@8@}).
