[{@Mausalaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the battle
<div n="lb">with clubs,” the 16th of the great and the 98th of the
<div n="lb">minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Mausala). § 793: {%Vaiśam-%}
<div n="lb">{%pāyana%} said: When the 36th year [after the great battle]
<div n="lb">was reached, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} beheld many unusual portents
<div n="lb">(specification). A little while afterwards he heard of the
<div n="lb">wholesale carnage of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} in a battle with clubs, where
<div n="lb">only {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Rāma%} had escaped with life; he summoned
<div n="lb">his brothers and took counsel with them; they were filled
<div n="lb">with grief; the death of {%Kṛṣṇa%} they could not believe.
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} inquired about the particulars of the destruction
<div n="lb">of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas. Vaiśampāyana%} said: **When
<div n="lb">the 36th year…(cf. above). Asked by {%Janamejaya,%}
<div n="lb">cursed by whom the {%Vṛṣṇis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), met with destruction,
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Sāraṇa,%} etc., saw {%Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Nārada%} arrived at {%Dvārakā;%} they disguised {%Śāmba%} as
<div n="lb">a woman, calling her the wife of {%Babhru,%} and asked the
<div n="lb">ascetics what [sort of child] this one would bring forth. The
<div n="lb">ascetics answered: “This {%Śāmba%} will bring forth a terrible
<div n="lb">iron club for the destruction of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas,%}
<div n="lb">except {%Rāma%} (who will enter the ocean) and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (whom
<div n="lb">{%Jarā%} will pierce while lying on the ground).” Then they
<div n="lb">went to {%Kṛṣṇa.%} Informed of what had taken place, {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">summoned all the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and told them of it, but did not
<div n="lb">try to annul the curse. The next day {%Śāmba%} actually
<div n="lb">brought forth an iron club. The fact was reported to the
<div n="lb">king {%[Ugrasena],%} who caused it to be reduced into powder
<div n="lb">and thrown into the sea. At the command of {%Āhuka,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the manufacture of spirits was forbidden among
<div n="lb">all the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas,%} under the penance of being
<div n="lb">impaled alive with all one's kinsmen. All the citizens
<div n="lb">(knowing that it was the command of Rāma also) bound
<div n="lb">themselves by the rule (XVI, {@1@}). [The embodied form of]
<div n="lb">Time every day wandered about their houses, like a man
<div n="lb">of terrible and fierce aspect, bald head, black and tawny
<div n="lb">of complexion; they shot innumerable arrows at him, without
<div n="lb">being able to pierce him. Also other dreadful portents of
<div n="lb">calamity were daily seen by the {%Vṛṣṇis%} throughout the city
<div n="lb">(description). They showed disregard for brahmans, P., and
<div n="lb">D., etc., except {%Rāma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. When the {%Pāñca-%}
<div n="lb">{%janya%} was blown in their houses, asses brayed aloud from every
<div n="lb">direction. {%Kṛṣṇa,%} seeing that the day of the new moon
<div n="lb">coincided with the 13th [and 14th] lunation, summoned the
<div n="lb">{%Yādavas%} and said: The 14th lunation has been made the
<div n="lb">15th by {%Rāhu%} once more, as at the time of the great battle
[Page476-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">of the {%Bharatas%} (v. the note of PCR. on p. 5). He understood
<div n="lb">that the 36th year had come according to the curse of
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī,%} and that the omens were similar to those which
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had noticed when the two armies were arrayed
<div n="lb">in order of battle. He endeavoured to bring about those
<div n="lb">occurrences which would make {%Gāndhārī's%} words true. He
<div n="lb">commanded the {%Vṛṣṇis%} to make a pilgrimage to some sacred
<div n="lb">water, and caused the messengers to proclaim a journey to
<div n="lb">the sea-coast (XVI, {@2@}). At that time the {%Vṛṣṇi%} ladies
<div n="lb">dreamt every night that a black woman with white teeth,
<div n="lb">entering their abodes, laughed aloud and ran through {%Dvārakā%}
<div n="lb">stealing [from them]; the men dreamt of vultures that
<div n="lb">devoured the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%} in the houses and fire-
<div n="lb">chambers; their ornaments, etc., were taken away by Rā.
<div n="lb">The iron discus of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} given by {%Agni,%} with a nave of
<div n="lb">adamant, ascended to heaven. {%Kṛṣṇa's%} chariot was dragged
<div n="lb">away by his four steeds over the ocean; {%Kṛṣṇa's%} and {%Baladeva's%}
<div n="lb">standards (resp. {%Garuḍa%} and a palmyra), which were reverently
<div n="lb">worshipped by those two heroes, were taken away by Aps.,
<div n="lb">who day and night called upon the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%} to
<div n="lb">set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred water. They prepared
<div n="lb">various kinds of edibles and spirits, and set out to {%Prabhāsa.%}
<div n="lb">{%Uddhava%} took leave of them and {%Kṛṣṇa%} before departing
<div n="lb">[from the world]. The {%Vṛṣṇis,%} mixing with spirits the food
<div n="lb">that had been cooked for the brahmans, gave it to apes, and
<div n="lb">began revels with drinking, so also {%Rāma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Yuyu-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhāna%} blamed {%Kṛtavarman%} for the nightly slaughter, and was
<div n="lb">applauded by {%Pradyumna,%} but was rebuked by {%Kṛtavarman%}
<div n="lb">with having killed {%Bhūriśravas%} while sitting in {%prāya; Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">cast an angry glance [at {%Kṛtavarman%}], and {%Sātyaki%} informed
<div n="lb">him of the story of the gem {%Syamantaka,%} which was {%Satrājit's;%}
<div n="lb">{%Satyabhāmā,%} weeping, approached {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and sitting on his
<div n="lb">lap enhanced his anger; {%Sātyaki%} swore that he would cause
<div n="lb">{%Kṛtavarman%} to follow the five sons of {%Draupadī,%} etc (<lang n="greek"></lang>), whom
<div n="lb">he had slain with the help of {%Aśvatthāman,%} and he severed his
<div n="lb">head in the very sight of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and began to strike down
<div n="lb">others; {%Kṛṣṇa%} rushed forward to prevent him from doing
<div n="lb">further mischief, and the {%Bhojas%} and {%Andhakas%} all assailed
<div n="lb">him; {%Kṛṣṇa%} did not interfere; they struck {%Yuyudhāna%} with
<div n="lb">the pots from which they had been eating; {%Pradyumna%}
<div n="lb">rushed forward to rescue {%Yuyudhāna;%} they were both slain.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} in wrath took up a handful of {%erakā%} grass, which
<div n="lb">became a terrible iron club, with which {%Kṛṣṇa%} slew all
<div n="lb">that came before him. The {%Andhakas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), also took up
<div n="lb">blades of the {%erakā%} grass, which were converted into iron
<div n="lb">clubs, and struck one another in consequence of the curse
<div n="lb">of the brahmans; son killed father and vice versa, inebriated
<div n="lb">with spirits. Beholding that {%Śāmba,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were slain, {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">exterminated the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and the {%Andhakas. Babhru%} and
<div n="lb">{%Dāruka%} told him now to go to {%Rāma%} (XVI, {@3@}). {%Dāruka, Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Babhru,%} seeking {%Rāma,%} saw him sitting thoughtfully,
<div n="lb">reclining his back against a tree. {%Kṛṣṇa%} sent {%Dāruka%} to
<div n="lb">inform {%Arjuna%} and tell him to come quickly, and he also
<div n="lb">dispatched {%Babhru%} to protect the ladies against robbers; but
<div n="lb">as soon as {%Babhru%} had proceeded to a distance, an iron club
<div n="lb">attached to the mallet of a hunter came and slew him.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} then, entering {%Dvāravatī,%} told his father to protect
<div n="lb">the ladies till {%Arjuna%} came, saying that he would practise
<div n="lb">penances with {%Rāma.%} When he came to {%Rāma,%} the latter had
<div n="lb">applied himself to {%yoga,%} and from his mouth issued a huge
<div n="lb">white {%Nāga%} with 1,000 heads and red eyes, who proceeded to
<div n="lb">the ocean, and was received by the ocean and many celestial
<div n="lb">snakes (and many sacred rivers): {%Karkoṭaka,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). After
[Page476-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Rāma's%} death {%Kṛṣṇa%} wandered for some time, and then sat
<div n="lb">down, thinking of {%Gāndhārī%} (§ 619) and {%Durvāsas%} (§ 773{%c%}),
<div n="lb">and the destruction of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas,%} and {%Kurus,%}
<div n="lb">whence he concluded that the hour [of his death] had come;
<div n="lb">he then restrained his senses [in {%yoga%}]; though he was the
<div n="lb">Supreme Deity, he wished to die in order to dispel all
<div n="lb">doubts, etc., and to make the words of {%Durvāsas%} true. The
<div n="lb">hunter {%Jarā,%} mistaking {%Kṛṣṇa%} for a deer, pierced him at
<div n="lb">the heel with an arrow; coming up, he beheld a man dressed
<div n="lb">in yellow robes, rapt in {%yoga,%} with many arms; he became
<div n="lb">filled with fear; {%Kṛṣṇa%} comforted him and then ascended
<div n="lb">upwards, and was received in heaven by {%Indra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(XVI, {@4@}). Meanwhile {%Dāruka%} came and informed the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} of the slaughter of the {%Vṛṣṇis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">with {%Dāruka%} proceeded to {%Dvārakā;%} when {%Kṛṣṇa's%} 16,000
<div n="lb">wives saw {%Arjuna,%} they uttered a loud cry; the city seemed
<div n="lb">to {%Arjuna%} to be the fierce river {%Vaitaraṇī; Arjuna, Satyā%}
<div n="lb">(the daughter of {%Satrājit%}), and {%Rukmiṇī%} fell down and wailed;
<div n="lb">then praising {%Kṛṣṇa%} and comforting the ladies, {%Arjuna%} went
<div n="lb">to {%Vasudeva%} (XVI, {@5@}), whom he found lying on the ground
<div n="lb">and burning with grief; {%Vasudeva%} lamented (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and said he
<div n="lb">would die by abstaining from food (XVI, {@6@}). {%Arjuna%} said
<div n="lb">that the hour had come for the {%Pāṇḍavas%} also for departing
<div n="lb">[from the world] (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he would, however, first remove to
<div n="lb">{%Indraprastha%} the women, the children, and the aged of the
<div n="lb">{%Vṛṣṇis.%} Saying to {%Dāruka%} that he wished to see the chief
<div n="lb">officers of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Arjuna%} entered the hall of the
<div n="lb">{%Yādavas%} called {%Sudharmā,%} where he said to the citizens and
<div n="lb">ministers that he would take away with him the remnants
<div n="lb">of the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas,%} as the sea would soon engulf
<div n="lb">the city; {%Vajra%} would be their king at {%Indraprastha;%} they
<div n="lb">would set out on the seventh day at sunrise. {%Arjuna%} passed
<div n="lb">that night in the mansion of {%Kṛṣṇa.%} At dawn {%Vasudeva%} by
<div n="lb">{%yoga%} attained to the highest goal; the ladies were in despair.
<div n="lb">His four wives, {%Devakī, Bhadrā, Rohiṇī,%} and {%Madirā,%} ascended
<div n="lb">the funeral pyre, and attained to the regions of {%Vasudeva.%}
<div n="lb">When {%Arjuna%} had caused {%Vasudeva%} and his four wives to be
<div n="lb">burnt (under immense tokens of sympathy from the women),
<div n="lb">the boys (headed by {%Vajra%}) and the ladies offered oblations
<div n="lb">of water to {%Vasudeva.%} Then {%Arjuna%} visited the spot where
<div n="lb">the {%Vṛṣṇis%} had been killed and caused the last rites to be
<div n="lb">performed, and caused {%Rāma%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} to be cremated. On
<div n="lb">the seventh day he set out, mounting his chariot, with the
<div n="lb">ladies and children, the {%Yādava%} troops, and other inhabitants,
<div n="lb">with {%Kṛṣṇa's%} 16,000 wives and {%Vajra;%} they numbered many
<div n="lb">millions in all. Then the ocean flooded {%Dvārakā.%} They
<div n="lb">proceeded in slow marches. When they had planted their
<div n="lb">encampment at {%Pañcanada,%} the {%Ābhīras (Mlecchas)%} conspired
<div n="lb">to rob the cavalcade. {%Arjuna%} succeeded only with great
<div n="lb">difficulty in stringing his bow; his celestial weapons would
<div n="lb">not come to his mind; the {%Vṛṣṇi%} warriors failed to rescue
<div n="lb">the women, who were snatched away by the robbers; {%Arjuna's%}
<div n="lb">shafts soon became exhausted; formerly they had been
<div n="lb">inexhaustible. {%Arjuna%} became very cheerless; he escorted
<div n="lb">the remnant of the cavalcade to {%Kurukṣetra;%} he established
<div n="lb">the son of {%Kṛtavarman%} in the city of {%Mārttikāvata%} with the
<div n="lb">remnant of the women of the {%Bhoja%} king; the remainder,
<div n="lb">with children and old men and women, at {%Indraprastha,%} with
<div n="lb">{%Vajra%} as their ruler; the son of {%Yuyudhāna%} (with old men,
<div n="lb">etc.) on the banks of the {%Sarasvatī;%} the widows of {%Akrūra,%}
<div n="lb">notwithstanding the entreaties of {%Vajra,%} entered the woods;
<div n="lb">{%Rukmiṇī,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), ascended the funeral pyre; {%Satyabhāmā%}
<div n="lb">and the other wives of {%Kṛṣṇa%} entered the woods in order
[Page477-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">to practise penances in the contemplation of {%Hari;%} going
<div n="lb">beyond {%Himavat,%} they took up their abode in {%Kalāpa-grāma.%}
<div n="lb">Then {%Arjuna%} entered the retreat of {%Vyāsa%} (XVI, {@7@}). Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Vyāsa%} (“Hast thou been sprinkled with water from
<div n="lb">anybody's nails or hair, etc.?”), {%Arjuna%} informed him of
<div n="lb">what had passed (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (“500,000 warriors have thus been laid
<div n="lb">down”). {%Vyāsa%} said that the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%} had
<div n="lb">been consumed by the brahman's curse; it was destiny:
<div n="lb">“{%Kṛṣṇa,%} as also the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} have finished their work; the
<div n="lb">time has come for your departure from the world,” etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} entered {%Hāstinapura%} and informed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of
<div n="lb">what had taken place (XVI, {@8@}).
