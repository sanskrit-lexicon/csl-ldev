was sent to look after the kine. His master forbade him
to enjoy the alms he received before he had offered it to
him; then, being deprived by the master of the whole alms,
and forbidden to go begging a second time, or to drink of
the milk of the cows, or the froth that the calves threw out
when sucking, he ate of the leaves of the {%arka%} plant ({%asclepias%}
{%gigantea%}), whence he became blind and fell into a pit. {%Āyoda%}
{%Dhaumya%} told {%U%}. to glorify the Aśvins, which he did; they
gave him a cake which he would not apply without offering
it to his preceptor, though the latter had himself formerly
obtained a similar cake without offering it to his preceptor.
The {%Aśvins%} gave him teeth of gold, while those of his preceptor
were of iron, and restored him to sight: I, {@3@}, ††697, ††698,
††700, ††704, ††708, ††711, ††717, ††718, ††721, ††739.
