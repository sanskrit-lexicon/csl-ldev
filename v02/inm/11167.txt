<div n="lb">to enjoy the alms he received before he had offered it to
<div n="lb">him; then, being deprived by the master of the whole alms,
<div n="lb">and forbidden to go begging a second time, or to drink of
<div n="lb">the milk of the cows, or the froth that the calves threw out
<div n="lb">when sucking, he ate of the leaves of the {%arka%} plant {%(asclepias%}

<div n="lb">{%Dhaumya%} told {%U.%} to glorify the Aśvins, which he did; they
<div n="lb">gave him a cake which he would not apply without offering
<div n="lb">it to his preceptor, though the latter had himself formerly
<div n="lb">obtained a similar cake without offering it to his preceptor.
<div n="lb">The {%Aśvins%} gave him teeth of gold, while those of his preceptor
<div n="lb">were of iron, and restored him to sight: I, {@3,@} ††697, ††698,
