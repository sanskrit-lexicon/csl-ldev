{@[Pañcendropākhyāna(ṃ)]@}¦ (“episode relating to the
five Indras”). § 238 (cf. Vaivāhikap.): {%Vyāsa%} said to
{%Drupada%}: In days of yore, when the gods were celebrating
a great sacrifice in the forest of {%Naimiṣa, Yama%}, holding
the office of {%śamitṛ%}, did not slay the creatures, so that their
numbers increased very greatly. {%Soma, Śakra, Varuṇa%},
[Page528-b+ 63]
{%Kubera%}, the {%Sādhyas%}, the {%Rudras%}, the {%Vasus%}, the {%Aśvins%},
etc., complained thereof to {%Prajāpati%}, who comforted them,
saying that when the sacrifice was over {%Yama%} would again
sweep away the inhabitants of the earth. The gods then
returned to the place of the sacrifice, and saw a golden lotus
carried along the {%Bhāgīrathī. Indra%} proceeded to the spot
where the {%Gaṅgā%} issues, and saw a beautiful woman (it
was {%Śrī%}), whose tears were being transformed into golden
lotuses. She led him to {%Mahādeva%}, who as a handsome
youth was seated with a young lady on a throne on one
of the peaks of the {%Himavat%}, playing dice. When {%Indra%}
spoke haughtily of himself, {%Mahadeva%} caused {%Śrī%} to paralyse
him and lead him into a hole, where four {%Indras%} of old
were confined in order to be reborn in the world of men,
there to slay a large number of men, and then to regain
the region of {%Indra%}. Their fathers should be {%Dharma%},
{%Vāyu, Maghavat%}, and the {%Aśvins, Indra%} creating a person
from himself to be the fifth among them. Their names
were {%Viśvabhuj, Bhūtadhāman, Śibi, Śānti%}, and {%Tejasvin%}.
The weeping woman ({%Śrī%}) was appointed to be their
common wife in the world of men. {%Nārāyaṇa%}, to whom {%Īśāna%}
(i.e. {%Śiva%}) and the five {%Indras%} repaired, approved of every-
thing. The five {%Indras%} were reborn as the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and
{%Śrī%} as {%Draupadī%}. A white hair of {%Nārāyaṇa's%} became {%Bala-%}
{%deva%}, and a black {%Kṛṣṇa%}, after having entered the wombs
of {%Devakī%} and {%Rohiṇī%}. Having related this to {%Drupada, Vyāsa%}
granted him celestial sight, so that he beheld the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
endued with their former bodies.—§ 239: {%Vyāsa%} then related
to {%Drupada%} the story of the damsel ({%= Śrī = Kṛṣṇā%}) whom
{%Śaṅkara%}, i.e. {%Śiva%}, appointed to be in a future birth the
wife of five husbands (see § 220) (I, {@197@}).
