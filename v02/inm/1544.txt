[{@Bhṛgu-Bharadvāja-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation
between Bhṛgu and Bharadvāja”). § 660{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): The
Primeval Being called {%Mānasa%} (description) > {%Mahat%} > Con-
sciousness > Space > Water > Fire and Wind > Earth.
The self-born {%Mānasa%} created a lotus pregnant with Energy >
{%Brahmán%} > all things, {%Brahmán = Ananta: Agni%} and {%Soma%} (=
the Sun and the Moon) are his eyes, etc. {%Bharadvāja%} asked
{%Bhṛgu%} about the extent of the firmament. {%Bhṛgu%} explained
[Page149-b+ 63]
that the firmament or Space is infinite, and is peopled with
systems upon systems of self-luminous bodies ({%devāḥ%}), etc.
{%Bharadvāja%} asked why {%Brahmán%} is called the first-born and
not the Lotus whence he sprang. {%Bhṛgu's%} answer: The
earth is that lotus, created to give rise to that form of
{%Mānasa%} which became {%Brahmán; Sumeru%}, reaching up to
heaven, became its pericarp (XII, {@182@}). {%Bharadvāja%} asked
how {%Brahmán%}, residing within {%Meru%}, created all things.
{%Bhṛgu%} said that {%Mānasa%} [in his form of Brahmán, PCR.]
created by fiat of Will, first water, which is the life of all
creatures; earth, etc., are transformations of water, and
have been produced by the solidification of that element.
{%Bharadvāja%} enquired after the manner and order of the
creation of the several elements; {%Bhṛgu%} explained that
in very ancient times (the {%Brahmakalpa%}) Br.-r., assembled
together, felt this very doubt, engaged in contemplation for
1,000 celestial years, and then heard a celestial voice saying:
“Formerly there was only infinite Space…” (XII,
{@183@}). Asked by {%Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu%} explained why only the
five primal elements are called {%Bhūtas. Bharadvāja%} enquired
why all the elements are not seen in the immobile
objects. {%Bhṛgu%} explained how all objects consist of all the
five primal elements, but in each the proportions are different;
as example he adduced the trees, which he showed to be not
inanimate, etc.; through the breath called {%Prāṇa%} living
creatures are enabled to move; through {%Vyāna%} they put
forth strength for action; {%Apāna%} moves downward; {%Samāna%}
resides within the heart; through {%Udāna%} one eructates and
is enabled to utter the seven original notes called {%Ṣadja%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) (XII, {@184@}). Asked by {%Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu%} explained
how fire resides within a living body, and how wind moves
the body; {%Prāṇa (c), Samāna (d), Apāna (e), Udāna (f%}),
{%Vyāna (g%}) (XII, {@185@}). {%Bharadvāja's%} observations on life
being worth little if that which is called life be due to the
action of fire and wind only (XII, {@186@}). {%Bhṛgu's%} observations
on the indestructibility of living creatures; {%Bharadvāja's%}
objection; {%Bhṛgu's%} answer (“it is fire that sustains the
breaths {%Prāṇa%}, etc.; that heat is called life…”).
{%Bharadvāja%} enquired on the true nature of life; {%Bhṛgu%}
explained that it is {%antarātman%} that inspires the body: water
—the soul ({%ātmā) = Brahmán%} (in all creatures) = {%kṣetrajña%}
and {%paramátman%} respectively; etc. There is no destruction
of the living agent; it is the body that is dissolved in death
(XII, {@187@}). {%Bhṛgu%} said: {%Brahmán%} first created only some
{%brahmans%} who were {%Prajāpatis%}; then Truth, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); then
D., Dā., G., Dai., As., M.-U., Y., Rā., N., Pś., and men
with their four divisions: {%brahmans%} (white), {%kṣattriyas%} (red),
{%vaiśyas%} (yellow), and {%śūdras%} (black); etc. {%Bharadvāja%} was
unwilling to admit any original distinction between the four
castes; {%Bhṛgu%} admitted that there is no original distinction
between them; all the world at first consisted of only
{%brahmans%}; how the different castes gradually rose; those are
not {%brahmans%} that are incapable of understanding that every
created thing is the Supreme {%Brahmán%}; they take birth as Pś.,
Rā., {%Pretas%}, and {%Mlecchas%} (XII, {@188@}). What acts constitute
a {%brahman%}, a {%kṣattriya%}, a {%vaiśya%}, a {%śūdra%}; a {%śūdra%} may
become a {%brahman%} by adopting the characteristics of a {%brahman%},
and {%vice versa%}; the duties that one should observe to become
truly righteous; the mind should be united with {%Prāṇa%},
and {%Prāṇa%} be held within {%Brahmán%} (XII, {@189@}). {%Bhṛgu%}
discoursed on the characteristics of Truth and Untruth;
happiness should always be sought; upon what happiness
depends; {%Bharadvāja%} doubted that happiness is the highest
[Page150-a+ 63]
aim (“{%Brahmán%} lives alone, observant of the vow of {%brahma-%}
{%carya; Śiva%} brought {%Kāma%} to extinction”); {%Bhṛgu's%} discourse
in explanation of {%Bharadvāja's%} doubt (“the earth is the pro-
genitrix of all creatures; females partake of her nature; the
male animal is like {%Prajāpati%} himself”) (XII, {@190@}). Asked
by {%Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu%} explained the consequences of gifts, of
righteousness, of conduct, of penances, of the study of the
{%Vedas%}, and of Sacrifices. Asked by {%Bharadvāja%}, he then
discoursed about the several kinds of duty; then about the
four modes of life (laid down in days of old by {%Brahmán%} for
the benefit of the world) and the duties of the several modes
(XII, {@191@}); on the duties of the Forest mode of life; on
those of the {%Parivrājakas. Bharadvāja%} enquired about the
existence of any region beyond that which we inhabit;
{%Bhṛgu%} indicated the existence in the North (on the other
side of {%Himavat%}) of a region that is the abode of the
righteous: “Here {%Brahmán%} in days of yore, and all the
gods with Ṛ., having performed proper penances, became
purified and attained to {%Brahmán.”—Bharadvāja%} worshipped
{%Bhṛgu%} with veneration (XII, {@192@}).
