[{@Bhṛgu-Bharadvāja-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation
<div n="lb">between Bhṛgu and Bharadvāja”). § 660{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): The
<div n="lb">Primeval Being called {%Mānasa%} (description) > {%Mahat%} > Con-
<div n="lb">sciousness > Space > Water > Fire and Wind > Earth.
<div n="lb">The self-born {%Mānasa%} created a lotus pregnant with Energy >
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} > all things, {%Brahmán = Ananta: Agni%} and {%Soma%} (=
<div n="lb">the Sun and the Moon) are his eyes, etc. {%Bharadvāja%} asked
<div n="lb">{%Bhṛgu%} about the extent of the firmament. {%Bhṛgu%} explained
[Page149-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">that the firmament or Space is infinite, and is peopled with
<div n="lb">systems upon systems of self-luminous bodies {%(devāḥ),%} etc.
<div n="lb">{%Bharadvāja%} asked why {%Brahmán%} is called the first-born and
<div n="lb">not the Lotus whence he sprang. {%Bhṛgu's%} answer: The
<div n="lb">earth is that lotus, created to give rise to that form of
<div n="lb">{%Mānasa%} which became {%Brahmán; Sumeru,%} reaching up to
<div n="lb">heaven, became its pericarp (XII, {@182@}). {%Bharadvāja%} asked
<div n="lb">how {%Brahmán,%} residing within {%Meru,%} created all things.
<div n="lb">{%Bhṛgu%} said that {%Mānasa%} [in his form of Brahmán, PCR.]
<div n="lb">created by fiat of Will, first water, which is the life of all
<div n="lb">creatures; earth, etc., are transformations of water, and
<div n="lb">have been produced by the solidification of that element.
<div n="lb">{%Bharadvāja%} enquired after the manner and order of the
<div n="lb">creation of the several elements; {%Bhṛgu%} explained that
<div n="lb">in very ancient times (the {%Brahmakalpa%}) Br.-r., assembled
<div n="lb">together, felt this very doubt, engaged in contemplation for
<div n="lb">1,000 celestial years, and then heard a celestial voice saying:
<div n="lb">“Formerly there was only infinite Space…” (XII,
<div n="lb">{@183@}). Asked by {%Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu%} explained why only the
<div n="lb">five primal elements are called {%Bhūtas. Bharadvāja%} enquired
<div n="lb">why all the elements are not seen in the immobile
<div n="lb">objects. {%Bhṛgu%} explained how all objects consist of all the
<div n="lb">five primal elements, but in each the proportions are different;
<div n="lb">as example he adduced the trees, which he showed to be not
<div n="lb">inanimate, etc.; through the breath called {%Prāṇa%} living
<div n="lb">creatures are enabled to move; through {%Vyāna%} they put
<div n="lb">forth strength for action; {%Apāna%} moves downward; {%Samāna%}
<div n="lb">resides within the heart; through {%Udāna%} one eructates and
<div n="lb">is enabled to utter the seven original notes called {%Ṣadja,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@184@}). Asked by {%Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu%} explained
<div n="lb">how fire resides within a living body, and how wind moves
<div n="lb">the body; {%Prāṇa (c), Samāna (d), Apāna (e), Udāna (f),%}
<div n="lb">{%Vyāna (g)%} (XII, {@185@}). {%Bharadvāja's%} observations on life
<div n="lb">being worth little if that which is called life be due to the
<div n="lb">action of fire and wind only (XII, {@186@}). {%Bhṛgu's%} observations
<div n="lb">on the indestructibility of living creatures; {%Bharadvāja's%}
<div n="lb">objection; {%Bhṛgu's%} answer (“it is fire that sustains the
<div n="lb">breaths {%Prāṇa,%} etc.; that heat is called life…”).
<div n="lb">{%Bharadvāja%} enquired on the true nature of life; {%Bhṛgu%}
<div n="lb">explained that it is {%antarātman%} that inspires the body: water
<div n="lb">—the soul {%(ātmā) = Brahmán%} (in all creatures) = {%kṣetrajña%}
<div n="lb">and {%paramátman%} respectively; etc. There is no destruction
<div n="lb">of the living agent; it is the body that is dissolved in death
<div n="lb">(XII, {@187@}). {%Bhṛgu%} said: {%Brahmán%} first created only some
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} who were {%Prajāpatis;%} then Truth, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then
<div n="lb">D., Dā., G., Dai., As., M.-U., Y., Rā., N., Pś., and men
<div n="lb">with their four divisions: {%brahmans%} (white), {%kṣattriyas%} (red),
<div n="lb">{%vaiśyas%} (yellow), and {%śūdras%} (black); etc. {%Bharadvāja%} was
<div n="lb">unwilling to admit any original distinction between the four
<div n="lb">castes; {%Bhṛgu%} admitted that there is no original distinction
<div n="lb">between them; all the world at first consisted of only
<div n="lb">{%brahmans;%} how the different castes gradually rose; those are
<div n="lb">not {%brahmans%} that are incapable of understanding that every
<div n="lb">created thing is the Supreme {%Brahmán;%} they take birth as Pś.,
<div n="lb">Rā., {%Pretas,%} and {%Mlecchas%} (XII, {@188@}). What acts constitute
<div n="lb">a {%brahman,%} a {%kṣattriya,%} a {%vaiśya,%} a {%śūdra;%} a {%śūdra%} may
<div n="lb">become a {%brahman%} by adopting the characteristics of a {%brahman,%}
<div n="lb">and {%vice versa;%} the duties that one should observe to become
<div n="lb">truly righteous; the mind should be united with {%Prāṇa,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Prāṇa%} be held within {%Brahmán%} (XII, {@189@}). {%Bhṛgu%}
<div n="lb">discoursed on the characteristics of Truth and Untruth;
<div n="lb">happiness should always be sought; upon what happiness
<div n="lb">depends; {%Bharadvāja%} doubted that happiness is the highest
[Page150-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">aim (“{%Brahmán%} lives alone, observant of the vow of {%brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%carya; Śiva%} brought {%Kāma%} to extinction”); {%Bhṛgu's%} discourse
<div n="lb">in explanation of {%Bharadvāja's%} doubt (“the earth is the pro-
<div n="lb">genitrix of all creatures; females partake of her nature; the
<div n="lb">male animal is like {%Prajāpati%} himself”) (XII, {@190@}). Asked
<div n="lb">by {%Bharadvāja, Bhṛgu%} explained the consequences of gifts, of
<div n="lb">righteousness, of conduct, of penances, of the study of the
<div n="lb">{%Vedas,%} and of Sacrifices. Asked by {%Bharadvāja,%} he then
<div n="lb">discoursed about the several kinds of duty; then about the
<div n="lb">four modes of life (laid down in days of old by {%Brahmán%} for
<div n="lb">the benefit of the world) and the duties of the several modes
<div n="lb">(XII, {@191@}); on the duties of the Forest mode of life; on
<div n="lb">those of the {%Parivrājakas. Bharadvāja%} enquired about the
<div n="lb">existence of any region beyond that which we inhabit;
<div n="lb">{%Bhṛgu%} indicated the existence in the North (on the other
<div n="lb">side of {%Himavat%}) of a region that is the abode of the
<div n="lb">righteous: “Here {%Brahmán%} in days of yore, and all the
<div n="lb">gods with Ṛ., having performed proper penances, became
<div n="lb">purified and attained to {%Brahmán.”—Bharadvāja%} worshipped
<div n="lb">{%Bhṛgu%} with veneration (XII, {@192@}).
