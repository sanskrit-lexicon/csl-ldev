In former times the Ṛ. residing in the {%Naimiṣa%} forest had
performed a sacrifice which extended over twelve years. After
the {%Viśvajit%} had been completed, the Ṛ. went to the country
of the {%Pāñcālas%} and solicited the king to give them twenty-one
calves to be given away as {%dakṣiṇā. Dālbhya Baka%} gave
them his, and then applied to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who, as some of
his kine had died, angrily told him to take these. {%B%}. set his
heart upon the destruction of king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}. Cutting
the flesh off from the dead animals, having ignited a fire on
the {%tīrtha%} of the {%Sarasvatī%}, he poured those pieces as libations
for the destruction of king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} kingdom, which
began to waste away, until he, reminded by his counsellors,
repairing to the bank of the {%Sarasvatī%}, had gratified Ṛ.
{%B.%}, who, in order to free his kingdom, again poured libations
into the fire. Receiving many animals as a gift, he once
more proceeded to the {%Naimiṣa%} wood, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
returned to his capital.
