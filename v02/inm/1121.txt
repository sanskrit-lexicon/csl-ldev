<div n="lb">In former times the Ṛ. residing in the {%Naimiṣa%} forest had
<div n="lb">performed a sacrifice which extended over twelve years. After
<div n="lb">the {%Viśvajit%} had been completed, the Ṛ. went to the country
<div n="lb">of the {%Pāñcālas%} and solicited the king to give them twenty-one
<div n="lb">calves to be given away as {%dakṣiṇā. Dālbhya Baka%} gave
<div n="lb">them his, and then applied to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} who, as some of
<div n="lb">his kine had died, angrily told him to take these. {%B.%} set his
<div n="lb">heart upon the destruction of king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} Cutting
<div n="lb">the flesh off from the dead animals, having ignited a fire on
<div n="lb">the {%tīrtha%} of the {%Sarasvatī,%} he poured those pieces as libations
<div n="lb">for the destruction of king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} kingdom, which
<div n="lb">began to waste away, until he, reminded by his counsellors,
<div n="lb">repairing to the bank of the {%Sarasvatī,%} had gratified Ṛ.
<div n="lb">{%B.,%} who, in order to free his kingdom, again poured libations
<div n="lb">into the fire. Receiving many animals as a gift, he once
<div n="lb">more proceeded to the {%Naimiṣa%} wood, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">returned to his capital.
