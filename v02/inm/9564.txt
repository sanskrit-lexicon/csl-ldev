{@Sarpasattra(ṃ)@}¦ (“the snake-sacrifice”).—§ 58{%b%} (cf.
Āstīkap. and Janam.). Compelled by the {%mantras%} innumerable
snakes fell into the fire (I, {@52@}).—§ 59: {%Caṇḍabhārgava%} (of
the race of {%Cyavana%}) was the {%hotṛ%} at the snake sacrifice, the
old {%Kautsa (Jaimini%}) the udgātṛ, {%Śārṅgarava%} (C. {%Sāṅgarava%})
the brahman, and {%Piṅgala%} the adhvaryu. {%Vyāsa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>),
were the {%Sadasyas%}.—§ 60: {%Takṣaka%} repaired to {%Indra%}, who
comforted him saying: “{%Brahmán%} was pacified by me for thy
sake.” {%Vāsuki%} summoned his sister (I, {@53@}), who told the
matter to {%Āstīka; Āstīka%} comforted {%Vāsuki%} and went to
the Snake-Sacrifice, but was not at first admitted by the door-
keepers, wherefore he gratified them; then he began to adore
the king, etc. (I, {@54@}).—§ 61: Comparing his sacrifice to
{%Soma's, Varuṇa's%}, and {%Prajāpati's%} in {%Prayāga%} of old, and to
{%Indra's%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), he praised {%Janamejaya's%} protection of his
subjects, and his abstinence, and said that he was either
{%Varuṇa%} or {%Yama%}, and compared him with {%Indra, Khaṭvāṅga%}
(a king, BR.; = Śiva?), etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) (I, {@55@}).—§ 62: {%Janame-%}
{%jaya%} was inclined to confer a boon on {%Āstīka%}; but the {%hotṛ%}
declared that {%Takṣaka%} was not yet burnt, and the {%ṛtvij'es%}
declared from the {%śāstras%}, and the {%Sūta Lohitākṣa%} (v. § 58)
confirmed it from the {%Purāṇas%}, that {%Takṣaka%} was now
hiding in the dwelling of {%Indra%}. As the {%hotṛ%} with
{%mantras%} began to pour clarified butter into the fire, {%Indra%}
appeared in his {%vimāna%} with the gods, {%Vidyādharas%} and
{%Apsarases%}, and {%Takṣaka%} hid himself in the upper garment of
{%Indra. Janamejaya%} ordered to throw {%Indra%} himself into the
fire together with {%Takṣaka%}. Shaking off {%Takṣaka, Indra%}
quickly returned to his own abode. {%Takṣaka%} was now falling
from heaven, and {%Janamejaya%} promised to grant to {%Āstīka%}
what he might desire. {%Āstīka%} said: “Let no more snakes
fall into the fire,” and refused to ask for any other boon (I, {@56@}).
—§ 63: Enumeration of the principal snakes of {%Vāsuki's%}
race that fell into the fire; (§ 64) of {%Takṣaka's%} race; (§ 65) of
{%Airāvata's%} race; (§ 66) of {%Kauravya's%} race; (§ 67) of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} race (I, {@57@}).—§ 68 {%Janamejaya%} let the sacrifice
come to an end; he bestowed wealth unto {%Lohitākṣa%}, etc.
