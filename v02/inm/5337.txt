{@Kapa@},¦ pl. ({%°āḥ%}), a class of demons. § 772{%p%} (Pavanārjuna-
saṃv.): Vāyu said: When the gods with {%Indra%} were in the
mouth of {%Mada, Cyavana%} took away from them the earth,
and they had been deprived of the heaven by the {%K. Brahmán%}
told the gods to seek the protection of the brahmans. The
brahmans commenced a rite for the destruction of the {%K%}. The
{%K%}. then sent {%Dhanin%}, who told the brahmans to desist, as
the {%K%}. were equal to M.-ṛ. and very pious in all respects
(enumeration). As the brahmans refused, the {%K%}. attacked
them, but the brahmans destroyed them by creating blazing
fires. The gods having slain many Dā. in battle did not
know that the {%K%}. had been slain by the brahmans, but were
informed by Nārada; then their energy increased and they
obtained immortality: XIII, {@158@}, 7329, 7331—4, 7339,
7341—6.
