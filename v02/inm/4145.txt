[{@Ghoṣayātrāparvan@}]¦ (“the expedition to the cattle
<div n="lb">station”), the 43rd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.
<div n="lb">(cf. Ghoṣayātrā). § 512: When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had arrived
<div n="lb">at the lake (of {%Dvaitavana,%} Nīl.), and were dwelling in the
<div n="lb">woods visited by {%veda%}-knowing ascetics, there came to them
<div n="lb">a brahman, who afterwards went away to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and
<div n="lb">told him how the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had become emaciated and reduced
<div n="lb">by wind and sun. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was much afflicted, considering
<div n="lb">that {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} who had formerly used to sleep on beds of
<div n="lb">{%raṅku%} skins and to be wakened by {%sūtas%} and {%māgadhas,%} now
<div n="lb">slept on the bare ground; he lamented the treatment he had
<div n="lb">permitted to be meted out to the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and feared lest they
<div n="lb">would avenge themselves; {%Arjuna,%} he thought, would not have
[Page307-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">left heaven, where he received the celestial weapons, if it were
<div n="lb">not for this purpose. This {%Śakuni%} told to {%Duryodhana,%} who
<div n="lb">was sitting with {%Karṇa,%} and {%Duryodhana%} was filled with grief
<div n="lb">(III, {@236@}). {%Śakuni%} and {%Karṇa%} proposed to {%Duryodhana%} that
<div n="lb">they should go to {%Dvaitavana%} to exult over the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@237@}). {%Duryodhana%} gladly approved the proposal, but
<div n="lb">feared that he might not obtain the permission of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb">who thought that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had become more powerful
<div n="lb">than before in consequence of their ascetic austerities. He
<div n="lb">asked them, with {%Duḥśāsana,%} to find out some skilful pretext.
<div n="lb">The next morning {%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni%} agreed with {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">that they should go there under the pretext of supervising
<div n="lb">their cattle stations (III, {@238@}). They then all saw {%Dhṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭra.%} A cowherd, named {%Samaṅga,%} who had been instructed
<div n="lb">beforehand, came to the king and spoke to him of the cattle.
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni%} asked him to give permission to {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">to go thither. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} suggested to send some faithful
<div n="lb">men, fearing some collision with the {%Pāṇḍavas%} if they were
<div n="lb">to go thither themselves; for though {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would
<div n="lb">not suffer his wrath to be awakened, {%Bhīma%} and {%Draupadī%}
<div n="lb">were naturally passionate. {%Śakuni%} promised that they would
<div n="lb">not go to the spot where the {%Pāṇḍavas%} resided, and obtained
<div n="lb">the permission. {%Duryodhana%} then started with {%Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana, Śakuni,%} etc., and ladies by the thousand, followed
<div n="lb">by the citizens and their wives, with 8,000 chariots, etc., and
<div n="lb">took up his quarters at the distance of a {%gavyūti%} from the
<div n="lb">lake of {%Dvaitavana%} (III, {@239@}). Having caused the calves
<div n="lb">to be marked, etc., {%Duryodhana,%} etc., began to sport and go
<div n="lb">a-hunting, and came to the lake. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was then,
<div n="lb">together with {%Draupadī,%} celebrating the diurnal {%rājarṣi%}
<div n="lb">sacrifice according to the ceremonial used in the forest. When
<div n="lb">the attendants of {%Duryodhana%} came to the banks of the lake to
<div n="lb">construct pleasure-houses, they were forbidden to enter by
<div n="lb">a number of {%Gandharvas,%} who told them that the king of the
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas%} had come from the abode of {%Kubera,%} with his
<div n="lb">followers and several hosts of {%Apsarases,%} etc., and when
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} sent a number of his warriors, they also were
<div n="lb">prevailed upon by the {%Gandharvas%} to return (III, {@240@}).
<div n="lb">A battle ensued between the soldiers of {%Duryodhana%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas,%} headed by their king {%Citrasena;%} the soldiers
<div n="lb">of {%Duryodhana%} fled, except {%Karṇa,%} who killed hundreds of
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas. Duryodhana, Śakuni, Duḥśāsana,%} and {%Vikarṇa%}
<div n="lb">returned to assist {%Karṇa,%} and the battle was renewed.
<div n="lb">{%Citrasena%} made use of illusion; it seemed as if every warrior
<div n="lb">of the {%Kuru%} army were surrounded by ten {%Gandharvas.%} The
<div n="lb">entire army of {%Duryodhana%} again fled, except {%Karṇa.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas%} then destroyed the chariot of {%Karṇa,%} who,
<div n="lb">mounting the chariot of {%Vikarṇa,%} was forced to drive away
<div n="lb">(III, {@241@}). {%Duryodhana%} refused to fly, but the {%Gandharvas%}
<div n="lb">destroyed his chariot and slew his charioteer and horses;
<div n="lb">thereupon {%Citrasena%} took him prisoner, and {%Duḥśāsana,%} who
<div n="lb">was seated on his chariot, and {%Citrasena, Viviṃśati, Vinda,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Anuvinda,%} and the royal ladies, were taken by other
<div n="lb">Gandharvas, [and {%Durviṣaha, Durmukha,%} and {%Durjaya,%}
<div n="lb">v. 14924]. The flying soldiers and ministers of {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">took refuge with {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (III, {@242@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">saying that the honour of the family was being destroyed
<div n="lb">by the {%Gandharvas'%} seizing {%Duryodhana,%} etc., in their
<div n="lb">presence, prevailed upon his brother to rescue {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (v. 14947: “the liberation of a foe from distress is equal
<div n="lb">to the bestowal of a boon, sovereignty, and the birth of a son,
<div n="lb">all the three put together”), if possible, by conciliation or
<div n="lb">lightly skirmishing, otherwise by all means, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
[Page308-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">being prohibited from partaking in the combat by his sacrifice.
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} promised to rescue {%Duryodhana%} or kill the king of the
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas%} (III, {@243@}). The four {%Pāṇḍavas,%} cased in mail
<div n="lb">and riding in chariots drawn by fleet horses, encountered the
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas;%} as these would not set {%Duryodhana,%} etc., free,
<div n="lb">as requested by {%Arjuna,%} a fierce battle ensued (III, {@244@}).
<div n="lb">The {%Gandharvas,%} in vain, attempted to break the chariots of
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} especially {%Arjuna,%} by means of his {%Āgneya%}
<div n="lb">weapon, sent millions of them to the abode of {%Yama.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas%} then rose up to the skies, taking the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
<div n="lb">with them, and showering maces, darts, etc., upon {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">who killed them with his weapons {%Sthūlākarṇa%} (B. Sthūṇā-
<div n="lb">karṇa), {%Indrajāla, Saura, Āgneya,%} and {%Saumya.%} At last
<div n="lb">{%Citrasena%} rushed at {%Arjuna,%} armed with a mace of iron; as
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} cut that mace in seven pieces with his arrows,
<div n="lb">{%Citrasena,%} by means of his science, concealed himself from the
<div n="lb">view of {%Arjuna,%} and thus continued to fight with him; but
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} destroyed his power of concealing himself by shooting
<div n="lb">at him with his celestial arms guided by the sound {%(śabdave-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhaṃ samāśritya).%} Then {%Citrasena%} showed himself to {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">reminding him of his being his friend, and there was put
<div n="lb">an end to the battle (III, {@245@}). {%Citrasena%} related to {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">that, staying in his abode, he had become acquainted with the
<div n="lb">purpose of {%Duryodhana,%} etc., and had been requested by {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">to bring {%Duryodhana%} thither in chains together with his
<div n="lb">counsellors. {%Arjuna%} entreated him to set {%Duryodhana%} free,
<div n="lb">but, at the request of {%Citrasena,%} they left it to be decided by
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira; Yudhiṣṭhira%} then liberated all the {%Kauravas.%}
<div n="lb">The {%Gandharvas%} went away with the {%Apsarases,%} and {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">revived the slain {%Gandharvas%} by sprinkling {%amṛta%} upon them.
<div n="lb">Friendly admonished by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Duryodhana,%} over-
<div n="lb">whelmed with shame, returned to his capital (III, {@246@}).
<div n="lb">When {%Duryodhana,%} afflicted with grief, was approaching
<div n="lb">{%Hāstinapura%} with his army, {%Karṇa%} congratulated him on
<div n="lb">the honourable victory over the {%Gandharvas%} (III, {@247@}).
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} told {%Karṇa%} that, as the {%Gandharvas%} had resorted
<div n="lb">to illusion and ascended the skies, he had been captured with
<div n="lb">his army, and that it was the {%Pāṇḍavas%} who had vanquished
<div n="lb">the {%Gandharvas%} (III, {@248@}). {%Duryodhana%} continued his
<div n="lb">narrative and declared that he would stay there abstaining
<div n="lb">from food, and that the others, headed by {%Duḥśāsana,%} should
<div n="lb">go to {%Hāstinapura.%} He then offered the royal power to
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana. Duḥśāsana,%} his voice choked in tears, refused
<div n="lb">to accept it. {%Karṇa%} reproached them for weeping thus, and
<div n="lb">declared that the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} who resided in the dominions of
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} and enjoyed happiness under his protection,
<div n="lb">only did their duty in liberating him (III, {@249@}). {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">continued explaining his opinion, that those who resided in
<div n="lb">the king's realm should always exert themselves to the best
<div n="lb">of their ability for the king; if the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had not followed
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} to the battle it would have been an improper act
<div n="lb">on their part. {%Duryodhana,%} firmly resolved to leave the world,
<div n="lb">desired not to rise from where he sat (III, {@250@}). {%Śakuni%}
<div n="lb">reproached {%Duryodhana%} for his foolish despair, saying that he
<div n="lb">ought rather to reward the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by granting them their
<div n="lb">paternal kingdom. {%Duryodhana%} embraced {%Duḥśāsana,%} but did
<div n="lb">not waver from his purpose; he spread {%kuśa%} grass on the earth,
<div n="lb">etc., and began to pray and worship mentally.—§ 513: The
<div n="lb">{%Daiteyas%} and {%Dānavas%} who had formerly been vanquished by
<div n="lb">the gods and were dwelling in {%Pātāla,%} having ascertained
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana's%} purpose, commenced a sacrifice with formulas,
<div n="lb">revealed by {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Uśanas,%} according to the rites
<div n="lb">indicated in the {%Atharvaveda%} and the {%Upaniṣad,%} assisted by
[Page308-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%brahmans%} of rigid vows, well versed in the {%Vedas%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Vedāṅgas.%} After these rites were ended a sorceress {%(kṛtyā)%}
<div n="lb">arose, whom the {%Daityas%} caused to bring {%Duryodhana%} to them
<div n="lb">in the night (III, {@251@}). The {%Dānavas%} said to him: “Do not
<div n="lb">do such a rash act as the vow of starvation. The suicide ever
<div n="lb">sinks into hell {%(adho yāti),%} and is blamed…In days of old
<div n="lb">we had obtained thee by ascetic austerities from {%Maheśvara;%}
<div n="lb">the upper part of thy body is wholly made of {%vajras,%} and is,
<div n="lb">therefore, invulnerable to weapons of every description; the
<div n="lb">lower part of thy body was made of flowers by {%Devī%} herself
<div n="lb">…Brave {%kṣatriyas,%} headed by {%Bhagadatta,%} will slay thy
<div n="lb">foes…In order to aid thee many {%Dānavas%} (v. 15172:
<div n="lb">{%Daityas%} and {%Rakṣases%}) have been born on earth. Other
<div n="lb">{%Asuras%} will also possess {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa,%} and others;
<div n="lb">possessed by those {%Asuras%} these heroes will abandon their
<div n="lb">kindness and fight with thy foes…We have already
<div n="lb">settled the means of slaying {%Arjuna;%} the slain {%Naraka%} has
<div n="lb">assumed the form of {%Karṇa;%} recollecting his former hostility
<div n="lb">he will encounter both {%Keśava%} (i.e. Kṛṣṇa) and {%Arjuna,%} and
<div n="lb">vanquish {%Arjuna%} in battle. {%Indra%} in disguise will deprive
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} of his earrings and coat of mail. We also have
<div n="lb">appointed innumerable {%Daityas%} and {%Rākṣasas,%} the so-called
<div n="lb">{%Saṃśaptakas,%} who will slay {%Arjuna%}…Thou art ever our
<div n="lb">refuge, as the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are the refuge of the gods.” Then
<div n="lb">the {%Dānavas%} embraced and cheered him, and that very goddess
<div n="lb">{%(kṛtyā)%} carried him back to the spot where he had sat down
<div n="lb">intent upon putting an end to his life, and there she vanished.
<div n="lb">Now {%Duryodhana%} considered all as a dream, and thought he
<div n="lb">should defeat the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in battle. And also {%Karṇa,%} being
<div n="lb">possessed by the soul of {%Naraka,%} and the {%Saṃśaptakas,%} possessed
<div n="lb">by the {%Rākṣasas,%} were desirous of slaying {%Arjuna;%} and
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa,%} etc., influenced by the {%Dānavas,%} were
<div n="lb">not so affectionate towards the {%Pāṇḍavas%} as they had been.
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} did not tell anyone of this.—§ 514: When the
<div n="lb">night had passed away {%Karṇa%} again exhorted {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">and promised to slay {%Arjuna%} in battle. {%Duryodhana%} arose and
<div n="lb">arranged his army, and went to {%Hāstinapura,%} accompanied
<div n="lb">by {%Karṇa, Śakuni,%} his brothers headed by {%Duḥśāsana%} and
<div n="lb">{%Bhūriśravas,%} and {%Somadatta,%} and {%Bāhlīka%} (III, {@252@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 515: {%Karṇadigvijaya%} (q.v.).—§ 516: {%Duryodhanayajña%}
<div n="lb">(q.v.).—§ 517: Hearing the vow of {%Karṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">filled with anxiety, made up his mind to abandon {%Dvaitavana.%}
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} with his brothers, and {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} ruled the earth justly and worshipped the brahmans
<div n="lb">by sacrifices and profuse gifts (III, {@257@}).
