[{@Ghoṣayātrāparvan@}]¦ (“the expedition to the cattle
station”), the 43rd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.
(cf. Ghoṣayātrā). § 512: When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had arrived
at the lake (of {%Dvaitavana%}, Nīl.), and were dwelling in the
woods visited by {%veda%}-knowing ascetics, there came to them
a brahman, who afterwards went away to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and
told him how the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had become emaciated and reduced
by wind and sun. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was much afflicted, considering
that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who had formerly used to sleep on beds of
{%raṅku%} skins and to be wakened by {%sūtas%} and {%māgadhas%}, now
slept on the bare ground; he lamented the treatment he had
permitted to be meted out to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and feared lest they
would avenge themselves; {%Arjuna%}, he thought, would not have
[Page307-b+ 63]
left heaven, where he received the celestial weapons, if it were
not for this purpose. This {%Śakuni%} told to {%Duryodhana%}, who
was sitting with {%Karṇa%}, and {%Duryodhana%} was filled with grief
(III, {@236@}). {%Śakuni%} and {%Karṇa%} proposed to {%Duryodhana%} that
they should go to {%Dvaitavana%} to exult over the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(III, {@237@}). {%Duryodhana%} gladly approved the proposal, but
feared that he might not obtain the permission of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
who thought that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had become more powerful
than before in consequence of their ascetic austerities. He
asked them, with {%Duḥśāsana%}, to find out some skilful pretext.
The next morning {%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni%} agreed with {%Duryodhana%}
that they should go there under the pretext of supervising
their cattle stations (III, {@238@}). They then all saw {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%}. A cowherd, named {%Samaṅga%}, who had been instructed
beforehand, came to the king and spoke to him of the cattle.
{%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni%} asked him to give permission to {%Duryodhana%}
to go thither. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} suggested to send some faithful
men, fearing some collision with the {%Pāṇḍavas%} if they were
to go thither themselves; for though {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would
not suffer his wrath to be awakened, {%Bhīma%} and {%Draupadī%}
were naturally passionate. {%Śakuni%} promised that they would
not go to the spot where the {%Pāṇḍavas%} resided, and obtained
the permission. {%Duryodhana%} then started with {%Karṇa%},
{%Duḥśāsana, Śakuni%}, etc., and ladies by the thousand, followed
by the citizens and their wives, with 8,000 chariots, etc., and
took up his quarters at the distance of a {%gavyūti%} from the
lake of {%Dvaitavana%} (III, {@239@}). Having caused the calves
to be marked, etc., {%Duryodhana%}, etc., began to sport and go
a-hunting, and came to the lake. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was then,
together with {%Draupadī%}, celebrating the diurnal {%rājarṣi%}
sacrifice according to the ceremonial used in the forest. When
the attendants of {%Duryodhana%} came to the banks of the lake to
construct pleasure-houses, they were forbidden to enter by
a number of {%Gandharvas%}, who told them that the king of the
{%Gandharvas%} had come from the abode of {%Kubera%}, with his
followers and several hosts of {%Apsarases%}, etc., and when
{%Duryodhana%} sent a number of his warriors, they also were
prevailed upon by the {%Gandharvas%} to return (III, {@240@}).
A battle ensued between the soldiers of {%Duryodhana%} and the
{%Gandharvas%}, headed by their king {%Citrasena%}; the soldiers
of {%Duryodhana%} fled, except {%Karṇa%}, who killed hundreds of
{%Gandharvas. Duryodhana, Śakuni, Duḥśāsana%}, and {%Vikarṇa%}
returned to assist {%Karṇa%}, and the battle was renewed.
{%Citrasena%} made use of illusion; it seemed as if every warrior
of the {%Kuru%} army were surrounded by ten {%Gandharvas%}. The
entire army of {%Duryodhana%} again fled, except {%Karṇa%}. The
{%Gandharvas%} then destroyed the chariot of {%Karṇa%}, who,
mounting the chariot of {%Vikarṇa%}, was forced to drive away
(III, {@241@}). {%Duryodhana%} refused to fly, but the {%Gandharvas%}
destroyed his chariot and slew his charioteer and horses;
thereupon {%Citrasena%} took him prisoner, and {%Duḥśāsana%}, who
was seated on his chariot, and {%Citrasena, Viviṃśati, Vinda%},
and {%Anuvinda%}, and the royal ladies, were taken by other
Gandharvas, [and {%Durviṣaha, Durmukha%}, and {%Durjaya%},
v. 14924]. The flying soldiers and ministers of {%Duryodhana%}
took refuge with {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (III, {@242@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
saying that the honour of the family was being destroyed
by the {%Gandharvas'%} seizing {%Duryodhana%}, etc., in their
presence, prevailed upon his brother to rescue {%Duryodhana%},
etc. (v. 14947: “the liberation of a foe from distress is equal
to the bestowal of a boon, sovereignty, and the birth of a son,
all the three put together”), if possible, by conciliation or
lightly skirmishing, otherwise by all means, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
[Page308-a+ 63]
being prohibited from partaking in the combat by his sacrifice.
{%Arjuna%} promised to rescue {%Duryodhana%} or kill the king of the
{%Gandharvas%} (III, {@243@}). The four {%Pāṇḍavas%}, cased in mail
and riding in chariots drawn by fleet horses, encountered the
{%Gandharvas%}; as these would not set {%Duryodhana%}, etc., free,
as requested by {%Arjuna%}, a fierce battle ensued (III, {@244@}).
The {%Gandharvas%}, in vain, attempted to break the chariots of
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; especially {%Arjuna%}, by means of his {%Āgneya%}
weapon, sent millions of them to the abode of {%Yama%}. The
{%Gandharvas%} then rose up to the skies, taking the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
with them, and showering maces, darts, etc., upon {%Arjuna%},
who killed them with his weapons {%Sthūlākarṇa%} (B. Sthūṇā-
karṇa), {%Indrajāla, Saura, Āgneya%}, and {%Saumya%}. At last
{%Citrasena%} rushed at {%Arjuna%}, armed with a mace of iron; as
{%Arjuna%} cut that mace in seven pieces with his arrows,
{%Citrasena%}, by means of his science, concealed himself from the
view of {%Arjuna%}, and thus continued to fight with him; but
{%Arjuna%} destroyed his power of concealing himself by shooting
at him with his celestial arms guided by the sound ({%śabdave-%}
{%dhaṃ samāśritya%}). Then {%Citrasena%} showed himself to {%Arjuna%},
reminding him of his being his friend, and there was put
an end to the battle (III, {@245@}). {%Citrasena%} related to {%Arjuna%}
that, staying in his abode, he had become acquainted with the
purpose of {%Duryodhana%}, etc., and had been requested by {%Indra%}
to bring {%Duryodhana%} thither in chains together with his
counsellors. {%Arjuna%} entreated him to set {%Duryodhana%} free,
but, at the request of {%Citrasena%}, they left it to be decided by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira; Yudhiṣṭhira%} then liberated all the {%Kauravas%}.
The {%Gandharvas%} went away with the {%Apsarases%}, and {%Indra%}
revived the slain {%Gandharvas%} by sprinkling {%amṛta%} upon them.
Friendly admonished by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Duryodhana%}, over-
whelmed with shame, returned to his capital (III, {@246@}).
When {%Duryodhana%}, afflicted with grief, was approaching
{%Hāstinapura%} with his army, {%Karṇa%} congratulated him on
the honourable victory over the {%Gandharvas%} (III, {@247@}).
{%Duryodhana%} told {%Karṇa%} that, as the {%Gandharvas%} had resorted
to illusion and ascended the skies, he had been captured with
his army, and that it was the {%Pāṇḍavas%} who had vanquished
the {%Gandharvas%} (III, {@248@}). {%Duryodhana%} continued his
narrative and declared that he would stay there abstaining
from food, and that the others, headed by {%Duḥśāsana%}, should
go to {%Hāstinapura%}. He then offered the royal power to
{%Duḥśāsana. Duḥśāsana%}, his voice choked in tears, refused
to accept it. {%Karṇa%} reproached them for weeping thus, and
declared that the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, who resided in the dominions of
{%Duryodhana%} and enjoyed happiness under his protection,
only did their duty in liberating him (III, {@249@}). {%Karṇa%}
continued explaining his opinion, that those who resided in
the king's realm should always exert themselves to the best
of their ability for the king; if the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had not followed
{%Duryodhana%} to the battle it would have been an improper act
on their part. {%Duryodhana%}, firmly resolved to leave the world,
desired not to rise from where he sat (III, {@250@}). {%Śakuni%}
reproached {%Duryodhana%} for his foolish despair, saying that he
ought rather to reward the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by granting them their
paternal kingdom. {%Duryodhana%} embraced {%Duḥśāsana%}, but did
not waver from his purpose; he spread {%kuśa%} grass on the earth,
etc., and began to pray and worship mentally.—§ 513: The
{%Daiteyas%} and {%Dānavas%} who had formerly been vanquished by
the gods and were dwelling in {%Pātāla%}, having ascertained
{%Duryodhana's%} purpose, commenced a sacrifice with formulas,
revealed by {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Uśanas%}, according to the rites
indicated in the {%Atharvaveda%} and the {%Upaniṣad%}, assisted by
[Page308-b+ 63]
{%brahmans%} of rigid vows, well versed in the {%Vedas%} and the
{%Vedāṅgas%}. After these rites were ended a sorceress ({%kṛtyā%})
arose, whom the {%Daityas%} caused to bring {%Duryodhana%} to them
in the night (III, {@251@}). The {%Dānavas%} said to him: “Do not
do such a rash act as the vow of starvation. The suicide ever
sinks into hell ({%adho yāti%}), and is blamed…In days of old
we had obtained thee by ascetic austerities from {%Maheśvara%};
the upper part of thy body is wholly made of {%vajras%}, and is,
therefore, invulnerable to weapons of every description; the
lower part of thy body was made of flowers by {%Devī%} herself
…Brave {%kṣatriyas%}, headed by {%Bhagadatta%}, will slay thy
foes…In order to aid thee many {%Dānavas%} (v. 15172:
{%Daityas%} and {%Rakṣases%}) have been born on earth. Other
{%Asuras%} will also possess {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa%}, and others;
possessed by those {%Asuras%} these heroes will abandon their
kindness and fight with thy foes…We have already
settled the means of slaying {%Arjuna%}; the slain {%Naraka%} has
assumed the form of {%Karṇa%}; recollecting his former hostility
he will encounter both {%Keśava%} (i.e. Kṛṣṇa) and {%Arjuna%}, and
vanquish {%Arjuna%} in battle. {%Indra%} in disguise will deprive
{%Karṇa%} of his earrings and coat of mail. We also have
appointed innumerable {%Daityas%} and {%Rākṣasas%}, the so-called
{%Saṃśaptakas%}, who will slay {%Arjuna%}…Thou art ever our
refuge, as the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are the refuge of the gods.” Then
the {%Dānavas%} embraced and cheered him, and that very goddess
({%kṛtyā%}) carried him back to the spot where he had sat down
intent upon putting an end to his life, and there she vanished.
Now {%Duryodhana%} considered all as a dream, and thought he
should defeat the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in battle. And also {%Karṇa%}, being
possessed by the soul of {%Naraka%}, and the {%Saṃśaptakas%}, possessed
by the {%Rākṣasas%}, were desirous of slaying {%Arjuna%}; and
{%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa%}, etc., influenced by the {%Dānavas%}, were
not so affectionate towards the {%Pāṇḍavas%} as they had been.
{%Duryodhana%} did not tell anyone of this.—§ 514: When the
night had passed away {%Karṇa%} again exhorted {%Duryodhana%},
and promised to slay {%Arjuna%} in battle. {%Duryodhana%} arose and
arranged his army, and went to {%Hāstinapura%}, accompanied
by {%Karṇa, Śakuni%}, his brothers headed by {%Duḥśāsana%} and
{%Bhūriśravas%}, and {%Somadatta%}, and {%Bāhlīka%} (III, {@252@}).—
§ 515: {%Karṇadigvijaya%} (q.v.).—§ 516: {%Duryodhanayajña%}
(q.v.).—§ 517: Hearing the vow of {%Karṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira%},
filled with anxiety, made up his mind to abandon {%Dvaitavana%}.
{%Duryodhana%} with his brothers, and {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa%}, and
{%Karṇa%} ruled the earth justly and worshipped the brahmans
by sacrifices and profuse gifts (III, {@257@}).
