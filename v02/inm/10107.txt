[{@Subhadrāharaṇaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“Arjuna's carrying
away Subhadrā”, the 17th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
(Cf. Subhadrāharaṇa.) § 252: Some days afterwards a
mountain festival of the {%Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis%}, and {%Andhakas%} was
held on the {%Raivataka%} mountain; there {%Haladhara%} (i.e. Bala-
rāma) with {%Revatī%}, followed by {%Gandharvas%}, king {%Ugrasena%},
with his 1000 wives, {%Raukmiṇeya, Śāmba, Akrūra, Sāraṇa%},
{%Gada, Babhru, Vidūratha, Niśaṭha, Cārudeṣṇa, Pṛthu, Vipṛthu%},
{%Satyaka, Sātyaki, Bhaṅgakāra, Mahārava, Hārdikya, Uddhava%},
etc., were present; {%Arjuna%} fell in love with {%Subhadrā%}, the
favourite daughter of {%Vasudeva%}, the sister of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and
uterine sister of {%Sāraṇa. Kṛṣṇa%} told him to carry her away
by force, as the result of a {%svayaṃvara%} was doubtful. They
sent a courier to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at {%Indraprastha%}, and obtained
his assent (I, {@219@}). {%Arjuna%} set out as for a hunting expedi-
tion in his chariot, yoked with {%Śaibya%} and {%Sugrīva%}, and
carried away {%Subhadrā%} towards {%Indraprastha%}. The soldiers
ran to {%Dvārakā%} to the {%sabhā%}, named {%Sudharmā%}, and informed
the {%sābhāpāla%}, who, by blowing the drum of alarm ({%bherīṃ%}
{%sānnāhikīṃ%}) caused the {%Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas%}, and {%Bhojas%} to
assemble at the {%sabhā%}. While they made a loud uproar,
{%Baladeva%} restored silence by saying that they ought first to
hear what {%Kṛṣṇa%} purposed. Then, seeing {%Kṛṣṇa%} sitting
silent, he spoke angrily about this deed of {%Arjuna%} (I, {@220@}).
