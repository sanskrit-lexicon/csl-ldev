[{@Subhadrāharaṇaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“Arjuna's carrying
<div n="lb">away Subhadrā”, the 17th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
<div n="lb">(Cf. Subhadrāharaṇa.) § 252: Some days afterwards a
<div n="lb">mountain festival of the {%Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis,%} and {%Andhakas%} was
<div n="lb">held on the {%Raivataka%} mountain; there {%Haladhara%} (i.e. Bala-
<div n="lb">rāma) with {%Revatī,%} followed by {%Gandharvas,%} king {%Ugrasena,%}
<div n="lb">with his 1000 wives, {%Raukmiṇeya, Śāmba, Akrūra, Sāraṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Gada, Babhru, Vidūratha, Niśaṭha, Cārudeṣṇa, Pṛthu, Vipṛthu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Satyaka, Sātyaki, Bhaṅgakāra, Mahārava, Hārdikya, Uddhava,%}
<div n="lb">etc., were present; {%Arjuna%} fell in love with {%Subhadrā,%} the
<div n="lb">favourite daughter of {%Vasudeva,%} the sister of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">uterine sister of {%Sāraṇa. Kṛṣṇa%} told him to carry her away
<div n="lb">by force, as the result of a {%svayaṃvara%} was doubtful. They
<div n="lb">sent a courier to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at {%Indraprastha,%} and obtained
<div n="lb">his assent (I, {@219@}). {%Arjuna%} set out as for a hunting expedi-
<div n="lb">tion in his chariot, yoked with {%Śaibya%} and {%Sugrīva,%} and
<div n="lb">carried away {%Subhadrā%} towards {%Indraprastha.%} The soldiers
<div n="lb">ran to {%Dvārakā%} to the {%sabhā,%} named {%Sudharmā,%} and informed
<div n="lb">the {%sābhāpāla,%} who, by blowing the drum of alarm {%(bherīṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%sānnāhikīṃ)%} caused the {%Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas,%} and {%Bhojas%} to
<div n="lb">assemble at the {%sabhā.%} While they made a loud uproar,
<div n="lb">{%Baladeva%} restored silence by saying that they ought first to
<div n="lb">hear what {%Kṛṣṇa%} purposed. Then, seeing {%Kṛṣṇa%} sitting
<div n="lb">silent, he spoke angrily about this deed of {%Arjuna%} (I, {@220@}).
