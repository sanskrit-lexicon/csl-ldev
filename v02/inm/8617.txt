{@Pratijñāparvan(°va)@}¦ (“the section including the vow
of Arjuna,” the 74th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).—
§ 10 (Parvas.): I, {@2@}, 339.—§ 596: In the evening, when
{%Arjuna%}; having slain large numbers of {%Saṃśaptakas%}, pro-
ceeded towards his tent, he said to {%Kṛṣṇa%} that his heart was
affrighted; he noticed indications of disaster; {%Abhimanyu%}
did not come out with smiles to receive him, etc. He
remembered that {%Droṇa%} had this day formed the circular
army, which none save {%Abhimanyu%} could break, but he had
[Page561-b+ 63]
not taught him how to come out of it, after having pierced
it; he had heard the leonine shouts of the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%},
and {%Kṛṣṇa%} had heard {%Yuyutsu%} censuring them for having
slain a child instead of {%Arjuna%}, and then {%Yuyutsu%} had thrown
away his weapons afflicted with rage and grief. {%Kṛṣṇa%} con-
soled {%Arjuna%}, referring to the {%kṣatriya%} duties and heaven.
None save {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (who were always
acceptable to him) could address {%Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira%},
addressing him, told (VII, {@72@}) him the particulars of
{%Abhimanyu's%} heroism and fall. {%Arjuna%} vowed to slay
{%Jayadratha%} before the setting of the morrow's sun (his oath);
even as to {%As., D.%}, men, birds, snakes, {%P.%}, wanderers of the
night, {%B.-ṛ., D.-ṛ.%}, etc., he said that they would not
succeed in protecting him, even if he entered {%Rasātala%}, or
ascended the firmament, or repaired to the city of the gods
({%Devapuraṃ%}) or the city of {%Diti (Diteḥ puraṃ%}); if the sun
set before he had slain him, he would himself ascend the
pyre. {%Arjuna%} bent the {%Gāṇḍīva, Kṛṣṇa%} blew the {%Pāñcajanya%},
{%Arjuna%} the {%Devadatta%} (VII, {@73@}). Having been informed by
spies, {%Jayadratha%} was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear,
thinking that not even {%Droṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), not even {%D., G., As.%},
{%U., Rā.%}, can protect him against {%Arjuna%}; he wished to
return home. {%Duryodhana%} comforted him, saying that he,
{%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), would protect him. {%Jayadratha%}, accompanied
by {%Duryodhana%}, repaired that very night to {%Droṇa%} and
questioned him about the difference between himself and
{%Arjuna. Droṇa%} said they had got the same instruction, but
{%Arjuna%} was superior to {%Jayadratha%} in consequence of {%yoga%}
and the hard life led by {%Arjuna; Droṇa%} would, however,
protect him, forming an impenetrable array; and, moreover,
death ought not to be an object of terror to him (VII, {@74@}).
{%Kṛṣṇa%} remonstrated with {%Arjuna%} for his rash vow; the
{%Kurus%} had expected an attack by {%Arjuna%}; now they will
protect {%Jayadratha%} (who had mentioned {%Arjuna's%} encounter
with {%Śiva, Hiraṇyapura%}, etc.); {%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>) would be in
{%Jayadratha's%} van; {%Droṇa's%} army would be half a {%śakaṭa%} and
half a lotus with a needle-mouthed array in the middle
(VII, {@75@}). {%Arjuna%} assured {%Kṛṣṇa%} of his competence to
accomplish his vow, notwithstanding {%Droṇa, Sā., R., V., A.%},
{%M.%}, with {%Indra, V.-D., D., P., G., Garuḍa%}, etc., by the
means of {%Gāṇḍīva%} and the weapons he had obtained from
{%Yama%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), and the {%Brāhma%} weapon (VII, {@76@}). The
gods with {%Indra%} became very anxious. Sinister omens
appeared in nature. {%Kṛṣṇa%} went to {%Arjuna's%} abode and
comforted {%Subhadrā%} (with the {%kṣatriya%} duties, etc., and
revenge) (VII, {@77@}). {%Subhadrā%} lamented over {%Abhimanyu%},
and said “fie on {%Bhīmasena%}, etc.” (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), because they had not
protected him. {%Draupadī%} and {%Uttarā%} came to her, lamenting
{%Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Abhimanyu%} had obtained the most laudable
and enviable goal. Then he returned to {%Arjuna%} (VII, {@78@}).
{%Arjuna%} performed his usual nightly sacrifice to {%Śiva. Kṛṣṇa%}
with {%Dāruka%} repaired to his own tent. None in the {%Pāṇḍava%}
camp slept that night, thinking of {%Arjuna%}. In the middle of
the night {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Dāruka%} that he had resolved to
fight to-morrow [if necessary]; he should equip his chariot,
placing on it {%Kaumodakī%}, etc., making room for {%Garuḍa%}, and
yoking thereto {%Balāhaka%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); when hearing {%Pañcajanya%}
emitting the shrill {%Ṛṣabha%} note, he should come to {%Kṛṣṇa%}
(VII, {@79@}). {%Arjuna%} in a dream saw {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who told him
not to grieve, and mentioned the {%Pāśupata%} weapon (with
which {%Śiva%} slew all the {%Daityas%} in battle); if he remembered
it now, he would be able to slay {%Jayadratha%} to-morrow;
otherwise he should pray to {%Śiva%}. At the {%Brāhma%} hour,
[Page562-a+ 63]
{%Arjuna%} saw himself sojourning through the sky ({%Himavat%});
{%Maṇimat%}, frequented by {%Si%}. and {%Cā.%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>) with {%Kṛṣṇa%},
to where {%Śiva%} was seated with {%Pārvatī%} (description) (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>);
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} hymned {%Mahādeva%} (VII, {@80@}). {%Arjuna%}
saw that the offerings he had made every night to {%Kṛṣṇa%}
had come to {%Śiva%}, and he mentally worshipped both {%Kṛṣṇa%}
and {%Śiva. Śiva%} then told {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} where to
fetch his bow and arrow from a lake of {%amṛta%}. In the
lake they saw two terrible snakes; when they had uttered
the {%Brahma Śatarudriya%}, the snakes assumed the forms of
a bow and arrow. From {%Śiva's%} body there came out
a {%brahmacārin%} of blue throat and red locks, and having
showed {%Arjuna%} the use of the bow and arrow, and the {%mantras%},
he sped these weapons to that same lake. Having thus once
more obtained the {%Pāśupata%} weapon, {%Arjuna%} with {%Kṛṣṇa%}
came back to their own camp (VII, {@81@}).—§ 597: THE FOUR-
TEENTH DAY. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} underwent his morning rites (very
copious description); {%Kṛṣṇa%} visited {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (VII, {@82@}).
Then also {%Virāṭa%}, etc., came (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%}
to rescue the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, quoting {%Nārada. Kṛṣṇa%} assured
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of {%Arjuna's%} success (VII, {@83@}). {%Arjuna%} came
and acquainted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of his dream. Then he and
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Yuyudhāna%} (these two in one chariot) set out to
{%Arjuna's%} pavilion. {%Kṛṣṇa%} equipped {%Arjuna's%} chariot (which
had previously been sanctified by {%manīras%}), which {%Arjuna%}
circumambulated, bow and arrows in hand. {%Arjuna, Yuyu-%}
{%dhāna%}, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} mounted the chariot. Many auspicious
omens appeared. {%Arjuna%} charged {%Yuyudhāna%} to protect
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in his absence (only he or {%Pradyumna%} is able
to do it). {%Yuyudhāna%} proceeded to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (VII, {@84@}).
