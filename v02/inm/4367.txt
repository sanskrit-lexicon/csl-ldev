{@Hanūmad-Bhīma-samvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“conversation between
<div n="lb">Hanūmat and Bhīma”). § 425 (Bhīmakadalīkhaṇḍapraveśa):
<div n="lb">{%Hanūmat%} said that he was the son of {%Vāyu%} with the wife of
<div n="lb">{%Keśarin,%} and the friend of the Sun's son {%Sugrīva,%} who, together
<div n="lb">with {%Śakra's%} son {%Vālin,%} used to be waited upon by all monkeys;
<div n="lb">further, that {%Sugrīva%} had been driven out by his brother, and
<div n="lb">dwelt for a long time with {%Hanūmat%} at {%Ṛṣyamūka,%} when
<div n="lb">{%Rāma Dāśarathi,%} who was {%Viṣṇu%} in human shape, with his
<div n="lb">wife and younger brother resided in the {%Daṇḍaka%} forest, and
<div n="lb">the {%Rākṣasa Rāvaṇa%} carried away {%Sītā, Rāma's%} queen, from
<div n="lb">{%Janasthāna,%} assisted by the {%Rākṣasa Mārīca,%} in the form of
<div n="lb">a deer marked with gems and gold (III, {@147@}). {%Rāma%} slew
<div n="lb">{%Vālin%} and installed {%Sugrīva%} in the kingdom; {%Sugrīva%} sent
<div n="lb">monkeys to inquire after {%Sītā,%} and according to the communi-
<div n="lb">cations of the vulture {%Sampāti, Hanūmat%} crossed the ocean,
<div n="lb">extending over 100 {%yojanas,%} saw {%Sītā%} in the abode of {%Rāvaṇa,%}
<div n="lb">burnt {%Laṅkā,%} and returned to {%Rāma. Rāma%} constructed
<div n="lb">a bridge across the deep, and, followed by myriads of
<div n="lb">monkeys, he slew {%Rāvaṇa,%} his brother, sons, and kindred,
<div n="lb">together with all the {%Rākṣasas,%} and installed the pious
<div n="lb">{%Rākṣasa%} chief {%Vibhīṣaṇa%} in the kingdom in {%Laṅkā,%} and then
<div n="lb">returned with {%Sītā%} to his city {%Ayodhyā,%} and was established
<div n="lb">in the kingdom. {%Rāma%} granted to {%Hanūmat%} that he should
<div n="lb">live as long as the history of {%Rāma's%} deeds is remembered
<div n="lb">on earth. {%Rāma%} went to his own abode after having reigned
<div n="lb">11,000 years. From that time all excellent objects of
<div n="lb">entertainment were, through the grace of {%Sītā,%} supplied to
<div n="lb">{%Hanūmat,%} who constantly stayed there hearing the deeds of {%Rāma%}
<div n="lb">sung by {%Apsarases%} and {%Gandharvas%} (cf. v. 11, 323). He had
<div n="lb">obstructed this path of the gods to {%Bhīma%} with the view that
<div n="lb">none might defeat or curse him (III, {@148@}).—§ 426: When
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} asked {%Hanūmat%} to show him the form he had when
<div n="lb">crossing the ocean, {%Hanūmat%} declared this to be impossible, as
<div n="lb">all things diminish according to the different {%yugas,%} even the
<div n="lb">{%Siddhas,%} gods, and great {%ṛṣis.%} Then he described the {%Kṛta-%}
<div n="lb">{%yuga(b)%} and the {%Tretā%} (q.v., § 427), {%Dvāpara%} (q.v., § 428), and
<div n="lb">{%Kaliyuga%} (q.v., § 429).—§ 430: {%Hanūmat%} was prevailed upon
<div n="lb">to grant the request of {%Bhīma%} (see § 426), and showed himself
<div n="lb">as great as the {%Vindhya%} or the {%Maināka%} mountain, and said
<div n="lb">that he might become as long as he wished; he had himself
<div n="lb">been able to slay {%Rāvaṇa,%} but would not obscure the glory of
<div n="lb">{%Rāma.%} He pointed out to {%Bhīma%} the way to the {%Saugandhika-%}
<div n="lb">{%vana%} and the garden of {%Kubera,%} which was guarded by
<div n="lb">{%Yakṣas%} and {%Rākṣasas,%} and warned him against plucking the
<div n="lb">flowers himself, delivering a discourse upon the duties of the
<div n="lb">four castes, etc. (III, {@150@}).
