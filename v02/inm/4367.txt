{@Hanūmad-Bhīma-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“conversation between
Hanūmat and Bhīma”). § 425 (Bhīmakadalīkhaṇḍapraveśa):
{%Hanūmat%} said that he was the son of {%Vāyu%} with the wife of
{%Keśarin%}, and the friend of the Sun's son {%Sugrīva%}, who, together
with {%Śakra's%} son {%Vālin%}, used to be waited upon by all monkeys;
further, that {%Sugrīva%} had been driven out by his brother, and
dwelt for a long time with {%Hanūmat%} at {%Ṛṣyamūka%}, when
{%Rāma Dāśarathi%}, who was {%Viṣṇu%} in human shape, with his
wife and younger brother resided in the {%Daṇḍaka%} forest, and
the {%Rākṣasa Rāvaṇa%} carried away {%Sītā, Rāma's%} queen, from
{%Janasthāna%}, assisted by the {%Rākṣasa Mārīca%}, in the form of
a deer marked with gems and gold (III, {@147@}). {%Rāma%} slew
{%Vālin%} and installed {%Sugrīva%} in the kingdom; {%Sugrīva%} sent
monkeys to inquire after {%Sītā%}, and according to the communi-
cations of the vulture {%Sampāti, Hanūmat%} crossed the ocean,
extending over 100 {%yojanas%}, saw {%Sītā%} in the abode of {%Rāvaṇa%},
burnt {%Laṅkā%}, and returned to {%Rāma. Rāma%} constructed
a bridge across the deep, and, followed by myriads of
monkeys, he slew {%Rāvaṇa%}, his brother, sons, and kindred,
together with all the {%Rākṣasas%}, and installed the pious
{%Rākṣasa%} chief {%Vibhīṣaṇa%} in the kingdom in {%Laṅkā%}, and then
returned with {%Sītā%} to his city {%Ayodhyā%}, and was established
in the kingdom. {%Rāma%} granted to {%Hanūmat%} that he should
live as long as the history of {%Rāma's%} deeds is remembered
on earth. {%Rāma%} went to his own abode after having reigned
11,000 years. From that time all excellent objects of
entertainment were, through the grace of {%Sītā%}, supplied to
{%Hanūmat%}, who constantly stayed there hearing the deeds of {%Rāma%}
sung by {%Apsarases%} and {%Gandharvas%} (cf. v. 11, 323). He had
obstructed this path of the gods to {%Bhīma%} with the view that
none might defeat or curse him (III, {@148@}).—§ 426: When
{%Bhīma%} asked {%Hanūmat%} to show him the form he had when
crossing the ocean, {%Hanūmat%} declared this to be impossible, as
all things diminish according to the different {%yugas%}, even the
{%Siddhas%}, gods, and great {%ṛṣis%}. Then he described the {%Kṛta-%}
{%yuga(b%}) and the {%Tretā%} (q.v., § 427), {%Dvāpara%} (q.v., § 428), and
{%Kaliyuga%} (q.v., § 429).—§ 430: {%Hanūmat%} was prevailed upon
to grant the request of {%Bhīma%} (see § 426), and showed himself
as great as the {%Vindhya%} or the {%Maināka%} mountain, and said
that he might become as long as he wished; he had himself
been able to slay {%Rāvaṇa%}, but would not obscure the glory of
{%Rāma%}. He pointed out to {%Bhīma%} the way to the {%Saugandhika-%}
{%vana%} and the garden of {%Kubera%}, which was guarded by
{%Yakṣas%} and {%Rākṣasas%}, and warned him against plucking the
flowers himself, delivering a discourse upon the duties of the
four castes, etc. (III, {@150@}).
