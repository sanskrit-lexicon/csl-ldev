{@[Rājasūyikaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">Rājasūya sacrifice,” the 25th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
<div n="lb">(Cf. Rājasūyikaṃ parva.) § 286: Under {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} rule
<div n="lb">the people were very happy, and great riches filled the
<div n="lb">treasury. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} resolved upon the celebration
<div n="lb">of the {%rājasūya. Kṛṣṇa%} came there, having appointed
<div n="lb">{%Ānakadundubhi%} to the command of the army. Then
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} sitting with {%Dhaumya, Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana,%} his
<div n="lb">brothers, etc., asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to install himself in that sacrifice
<div n="lb">or to permit the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to be installed in it. {%Kṛṣṇa%} said
<div n="lb">that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ought to perform it and employ himself
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Kṛṣṇa%}) in some office. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused his
<div n="lb">minister {%(mantrin) Sahadeva%} to get the articles together that
<div n="lb">{%Dhaumya%} might order as required for the sacrifice, and to
<div n="lb">let {%Indrasena%} and {%Viśoka%} and {%Puru,%} with {%Arjuna%} for his
<div n="lb">charioteer, engage in collecting food. {%Dvaipāyana%} himself
<div n="lb">became the {%brahman%} and appointed learned brahmans as
<div n="lb">{%ṛtvijes; Susāman%} (“the bull of the {%Dhanañjayas%}”) became
<div n="lb">the {%sāmaga, Yājñavalkya%} the {%adhvaryu, Paila%} (the son of
<div n="lb">{%Vasu%}) the {%hotṛ%} accompanied by {%Dhaumya,%} and their disciples
<div n="lb">and sons the {%hotragas%} (see BR.) who uttered benedictions, etc.
<div n="lb">Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused {%Sahadeva%} to dispatch messengers,
<div n="lb">who invited men of the four castes. Then the brahmans
<div n="lb">installed {%(dīkṣayāñ cakrire) Yudhiṣṭhira%} in the {%rājasūya%}
<div n="lb">sacrifice, the guests arrived, the artificers erected habitations,
<div n="lb">etc. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} despatched {%Nakula%} to {%Hāstinapura%} in
<div n="lb">order to fetch {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa,%} etc. (II, {@33@}). Enumeration of kings who came to
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira's rājasūya%} (II, {@34@}).—§ 288: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">saluted {%Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and appointed {%Duḥśāsana%}
<div n="lb">to attend to the food, etc., {%Aśvatthāman%} to the brahmans,
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} to the kings, {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%} to see what was
<div n="lb">done and what left undone, {%Kṛpa%} to attend to the diamonds,
<div n="lb">etc., and the dakṣiṇās; {%Vidura%} became the disburser,
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} the receiver of the tributes {%(arhaṇāni), Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">washed the feet of the brahmans. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} performed
<div n="lb">the sacrifice with six fires (II, {@35@}).—§ 292 (cf. Śiśupāla-
<div n="lb">vadhaparvan): Then the sacrifice was completed, watched
<div n="lb">by {%Kṛṣṇa.%} When the kings departed, the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} com-
<div n="lb">manded by {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} followed them to the confines of
<div n="lb">his dominions, one after another (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%} asked leave
<div n="lb">to go to {%Dvārakā,%} being thanked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} for his
<div n="lb">co-operation, and having bidden farewell to {%Pṛthā,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">and having performed his ablutions, etc., he walked round
<div n="lb">the {%Garuḍa-%}bannered chariot, which {%Dāruka%} had fetched, and
<div n="lb">ascending it set out for {%Dvāravatī,%} followed on foot by
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} till they took leave. Now {%Duryodhana%} alone,
<div n="lb">with king {%Subala's%} son {%Śakuni,%} remained in the assembly
<div n="lb">house (II, {@45@}).
