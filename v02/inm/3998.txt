[{@Gāndhārīputrotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“birth of Gāndhārī's sons”).
<div n="lb">§ 180 (Sambhavap.): One day {%Dvaipāyana,%} gratified with
<div n="lb">{%Gāndhārī's%} hospitality, granted her the boon that she should
<div n="lb">have 100 sons (cf. § 174). She had borne the burden in her
<div n="lb">womb for two years, when she heard that {%Kuntī%} had brought
<div n="lb">forth a son; she then struck her womb violently, and there
<div n="lb">came out a hard mass of flesh like an iron ball. When she
<div n="lb">was about to throw it away, {%Vyāsa%} appeared and caused
<div n="lb">her to put the ball of flesh, sprinkled with cool water and
<div n="lb">divided into 101 parts (each of the size of a thumb), into 101
<div n="lb">pots filled with clarified butter, which were placed in a
<div n="lb">concealed spot. After having said that she should open the
<div n="lb">covers of the pots after two years, {%Vyāsa%} retired to {%Himavat%} in
<div n="lb">order to devote himself to asceticism. {%Duryodhana%} was younger
[Page292-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">than {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} being born on the same day as {%Bhīma.%}
<div n="lb">As soon as {%Duryodhana%} was born he began to cry like an ass,
<div n="lb">and ill-portending omens appeared. {%Vidura,%} etc., in vain told
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to abandon him. Within a month the 100 sons
<div n="lb">of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and one daughter were born. During the
<div n="lb">pregnancy of {%Gāndhārī, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} begot the {%Karaṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%Yuyutsu%} upon a maidservant of the {%Vaiśya%} class (I, {@115@}).
