{@Garuḍa@},¦ the son of Kaśyapa and Vinatā, the vehicle of
Viṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa), or the emblem of his flagstaff. § 11
(Anukram.): I, {@2@}, 365.—§ 27 (Kaśyapa): I, {@16@}, 1092 (son
of Kaśyapa and Vinatā).—§ 32{%b%} (Kadrū): In the meantime
{%G%}. came out bursting the egg and ascended the skies. The
gods thought that it was Agni, but were undeceived): I, {@23@},
1239, 1245, 1248.—§ 33 (Āstīkap.): Then the gods and the
ṛṣis praised {%G%}. and prevailed upon him to diminish his own
energy and splendour: I, {@23@}, †1255.—§ 34 (do.): Bearing
his brother Aruṇa on his back {%G%}. went from his father's home
and arrived at his mother's side on the other shore of the
ocean and placed Aruṇa in the east: I, {@24@}, 1262.—§ 36{%b%}
(Kadrū): {%G%}. carried the snakes on his back, but ascended too
near to the Sun so that the snakes became scorched by the rays
of the Sun: I, {@25@}, 1283.—§ 40 (Āstīkap.): The serpents
promised that if {%G%}. brought them the amṛta he and his mother
should be freed from bondage (I, {@27@}). Having been directed
by Vinatā to live upon the Niṣādas ({%b%}) but not to injure the
brahmans, and being taught by her how to know who is
a brahman, he set out, and, having come to the Niṣādas,
he raised a great quantity of dust, and opened his mouth;
there the Niṣādas entered by thousands, being blinded by
the dust, and were devoured (I, {@28@}). A brahman who,
with his wife of the Niṣāda caste, entered the throat of
{%G.%}, and began to burn him, was recognized and relieved with
his wife by {%G%}. (I, {@29@}): I, {@28@}, 1320, (1327); {@29@}, (1343),
1344.—§ 41 (do.): As {%G.'s%} hunger was not appeased Kaśyapa
told him of the elephant Supratīka ({%b%}) and the tortoise
Vibhāvasu: I, {@29@}, (1348).—§ 42 (do.): Then Kaśyapa blessed
{%G.%}: I, {@29@}, 1371.—§ 43 (do.): {%G%}. then seized the elephant
and the tortoise and came to the tīrtha Alamba (?Nīl. and BR.,
“without reposing) ({%b%}). A banyan-tree invited him to sit
on one of its huge branches, but the branch broke (I, {@29@}).
{%G%}. caught the branch with his beak, and perceiving Vālakhilyas
suspended therefrom with their head downwards he continued
to fly with the branch, the elephant, and the tortoise, fearing
to kill the Vālakhilyas if he should throw away the branch.
The Vālakhilyas therefore gave him the name Garuḍa
(etymology: {%guruṃ bhāraṃ samāsādyoḍḍīnaḥ%}, v. 1390). On
Gandhamādana he saw Kaśyapa engaged in ascetic devotions.
Kaśyapa propitiated the Vālakhilyas ({%c%}) for him, then they
abandoned the bough and went to Himavat to practise ascetic
penances. According to the advice of Kaśyapa {%G%}. flew away for
[Page300-b+ 63]
a hundred thousand of yojanas to a mountain without human
beings, there he threw down the bough and ate the tortoise
and the elephant. Then he again rose on his wings: I, {@29@},
1375; {@30@}, 1384, 1390, 1400, 1407, 1413.—§ 44 (do.):
Omens foreboding fear began to appear among the gods.
Bṛhaspati declared that it was owing to the fault of Indra
and the ascetic penances of the Vālakhilyas (cf. § 45) that
{%G%}. now approached to take away the soma. Indra then
caused the gods to surround and watch the amṛta (I, {@30@}).—
§ 45 (Vālakhilya, pl.): I, {@31@}, 1436, 1469, 1470 (by the
penances of the Vālakhilyas {%G%}. had been born as the lord
of winged creatures ({%patatrīṇām indraḥ%}, v. 1455)).—§ 46
(Āstīkap.): {%G%}. attacked the gods, whom he blinded with
dust, and Bhaumana lay as dead on the field. Indra caused
Vāyu to dispel the dust. The Sādhyas and the Gandharvas
fled eastwards, the Vasus and the Rudras towards the south,
the Ādityas towards the west, and the Aśvins towards the
north. {%G%}. then slew nine Yakṣas, Aśvakranda, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>),
who guarded the amṛta. The amṛta on all sides was
surrounded with fire. {%G%}. then divided his mouth into
8100 mouths, and taking water from many rivers he
extinguished the fire. Then he assumed a diminutive body
(I, {@32@}), and passed through the spokes of the revolving
keen-edged wheel of steel placed before the soma. Then
there were two great snakes, who would reduce to ashes
everyone who might be seen by them. {%G%}. covered their
eyes with dust, and unseen by them mangled them to pieces.
He then flew away with the amṛta, not drinking it himself.
He met with Viṣṇu on his way and they agreed that
{%G%}. should stay above Viṣṇu, sitting on the flagstaff of his
chariot and be his vehicle, and be immortal and free from
disease without drinking amṛta. While {%G%}. was flying Indra
hurled his thunderbolt at him. {%G%}. did not feel the slightest
pain, but in honour of Dadhīca and Indra and the thunderbolt
{%G%}. dropped a feather, and from its beauty he gained the name
Suparṇa (I, {@33@}). Indra and {%G%}. made friendship with each
other, and agreed that {%G%}. should not give the soma to anyone
for drink. Indra should bring it away after it had been put
down by {%G.%}, and {%G%}. should feed on the snakes. The snakes
declared Vinatā to be free; {%G%}. placed down the soma on
some kuśa grass, and while the snakes were performing their
ablutions, their daily devotions, and other religious rites,
Indra took up the amṛta and reṭurned to heaven. When the
snakes licked the kuśa grass their tongues were divided in
twain, and the kuśa grass, from the contact with the amṛta,
became sacred from this time (I, {@34@}): I, {@32@}, 1471 ({%pakṣirāṭ%}),
1477, 1485, 1494; {@33@}, 1509, 1513; {@34@} (1520), (1528),
