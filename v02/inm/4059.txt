{@Garuḍa,@}¦ the son of Kaśyapa and Vinatā, the vehicle of
<div n="lb">Viṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa), or the emblem of his flagstaff. § 11
<div n="lb">(Anukram.): I, {@2,@} 365.—§ 27 (Kaśyapa): I, {@16,@} 1092 (son
<div n="lb">of Kaśyapa and Vinatā).—§ 32{%b%} (Kadrū): In the meantime
<div n="lb">{%G.%} came out bursting the egg and ascended the skies. The
<div n="lb">gods thought that it was Agni, but were undeceived): I, {@23,@}
<div n="lb">1239, 1245, 1248.—§ 33 (Āstīkap.): Then the gods and the
<div n="lb">ṛṣis praised {%G.%} and prevailed upon him to diminish his own
<div n="lb">energy and splendour: I, {@23,@} †1255.—§ 34 (do.): Bearing
<div n="lb">his brother Aruṇa on his back {%G.%} went from his father's home
<div n="lb">and arrived at his mother's side on the other shore of the
<div n="lb">ocean and placed Aruṇa in the east: I, {@24,@} 1262.—§ 36{%b%}
<div n="lb">(Kadrū): {%G.%} carried the snakes on his back, but ascended too
<div n="lb">near to the Sun so that the snakes became scorched by the rays
<div n="lb">of the Sun: I, {@25,@} 1283.—§ 40 (Āstīkap.): The serpents
<div n="lb">promised that if {%G.%} brought them the amṛta he and his mother
<div n="lb">should be freed from bondage (I, {@27@}). Having been directed
<div n="lb">by Vinatā to live upon the Niṣādas {%(b)%} but not to injure the
<div n="lb">brahmans, and being taught by her how to know who is
<div n="lb">a brahman, he set out, and, having come to the Niṣādas,
<div n="lb">he raised a great quantity of dust, and opened his mouth;
<div n="lb">there the Niṣādas entered by thousands, being blinded by
<div n="lb">the dust, and were devoured (I, {@28@}). A brahman who,
<div n="lb">with his wife of the Niṣāda caste, entered the throat of
<div n="lb">{%G.,%} and began to burn him, was recognized and relieved with
<div n="lb">his wife by {%G.%} (I, {@29@}): I, {@28,@} 1320, (1327); {@29,@} (1343),
<div n="lb">1344.—§ 41 (do.): As {%G.'s%} hunger was not appeased Kaśyapa
<div n="lb">told him of the elephant Supratīka {%(b)%} and the tortoise
<div n="lb">Vibhāvasu: I, {@29,@} (1348).—§ 42 (do.): Then Kaśyapa blessed
<div n="lb">{%G.:%} I, {@29,@} 1371.—§ 43 (do.): {%G.%} then seized the elephant
<div n="lb">and the tortoise and came to the tīrtha Alamba (?Nīl. and BR.,
<div n="lb">“without reposing) {%(b).%} A banyan-tree invited him to sit
<div n="lb">on one of its huge branches, but the branch broke (I, {@29@}).
<div n="lb">{%G.%} caught the branch with his beak, and perceiving Vālakhilyas
<div n="lb">suspended therefrom with their head downwards he continued
<div n="lb">to fly with the branch, the elephant, and the tortoise, fearing
<div n="lb">to kill the Vālakhilyas if he should throw away the branch.
<div n="lb">The Vālakhilyas therefore gave him the name Garuḍa
<div n="lb">(etymology: {%guruṃ bhāraṃ samāsādyoḍḍīnaḥ,%} v. 1390). On
<div n="lb">Gandhamādana he saw Kaśyapa engaged in ascetic devotions.
<div n="lb">Kaśyapa propitiated the Vālakhilyas {%(c)%} for him, then they
<div n="lb">abandoned the bough and went to Himavat to practise ascetic
<div n="lb">penances. According to the advice of Kaśyapa {%G.%} flew away for
[Page300-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">a hundred thousand of yojanas to a mountain without human
<div n="lb">beings, there he threw down the bough and ate the tortoise
<div n="lb">and the elephant. Then he again rose on his wings: I, {@29,@}
<div n="lb">1375; {@30,@} 1384, 1390, 1400, 1407, 1413.—§ 44 (do.):
<div n="lb">Omens foreboding fear began to appear among the gods.
<div n="lb">Bṛhaspati declared that it was owing to the fault of Indra
<div n="lb">and the ascetic penances of the Vālakhilyas (cf. § 45) that
<div n="lb">{%G.%} now approached to take away the soma. Indra then
<div n="lb">caused the gods to surround and watch the amṛta (I, {@30@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 45 (Vālakhilya, pl.): I, {@31,@} 1436, 1469, 1470 (by the
<div n="lb">penances of the Vālakhilyas {%G.%} had been born as the lord
<div n="lb">of winged creatures ({%patatrīṇām indraḥ,%} v. 1455)).—§ 46
<div n="lb">(Āstīkap.): {%G.%} attacked the gods, whom he blinded with
<div n="lb">dust, and Bhaumana lay as dead on the field. Indra caused
<div n="lb">Vāyu to dispel the dust. The Sādhyas and the Gandharvas
<div n="lb">fled eastwards, the Vasus and the Rudras towards the south,
<div n="lb">the Ādityas towards the west, and the Aśvins towards the
<div n="lb">north. {%G.%} then slew nine Yakṣas, Aśvakranda, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">who guarded the amṛta. The amṛta on all sides was
<div n="lb">surrounded with fire. {%G.%} then divided his mouth into
<div n="lb">8100 mouths, and taking water from many rivers he
<div n="lb">extinguished the fire. Then he assumed a diminutive body
<div n="lb">(I, {@32@}), and passed through the spokes of the revolving
<div n="lb">keen-edged wheel of steel placed before the soma. Then
<div n="lb">there were two great snakes, who would reduce to ashes
<div n="lb">everyone who might be seen by them. {%G.%} covered their
<div n="lb">eyes with dust, and unseen by them mangled them to pieces.
<div n="lb">He then flew away with the amṛta, not drinking it himself.
<div n="lb">He met with Viṣṇu on his way and they agreed that
<div n="lb">{%G.%} should stay above Viṣṇu, sitting on the flagstaff of his
<div n="lb">chariot and be his vehicle, and be immortal and free from
<div n="lb">disease without drinking amṛta. While {%G.%} was flying Indra
<div n="lb">hurled his thunderbolt at him. {%G.%} did not feel the slightest
<div n="lb">pain, but in honour of Dadhīca and Indra and the thunderbolt
<div n="lb">{%G.%} dropped a feather, and from its beauty he gained the name
<div n="lb">Suparṇa (I, {@33@}). Indra and {%G.%} made friendship with each
<div n="lb">other, and agreed that {%G.%} should not give the soma to anyone
<div n="lb">for drink. Indra should bring it away after it had been put
<div n="lb">down by {%G.,%} and {%G.%} should feed on the snakes. The snakes
<div n="lb">declared Vinatā to be free; {%G.%} placed down the soma on
<div n="lb">some kuśa grass, and while the snakes were performing their
<div n="lb">ablutions, their daily devotions, and other religious rites,
<div n="lb">Indra took up the amṛta and reṭurned to heaven. When the
<div n="lb">snakes licked the kuśa grass their tongues were divided in
<div n="lb">twain, and the kuśa grass, from the contact with the amṛta,
<div n="lb">became sacred from this time (I, {@34@}): I, {@32,@} 1471 {%(pakṣirāṭ),%}
