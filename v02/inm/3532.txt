[{@Dhṛtarāṣṭra-vivāha(ḥ)@}]¦ (“marriage of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra<sup>1</sup>”). § 174 (Sambhavap.): {%Bhīṣma%} proposed to marry
the two princes to {%Yādavī%} (i.e. Kuntī), and to the daughter of
the {%Gāndhāra%} king {%Subala%} (i.e. Gāndhārī), and to the daughter
of the {%Madra%} king. {%Gāndhārī%} had obtained from {%Śiva%} (cf.
§ 180) the boon that she should have 100 sons. She now
was brought to the {%Kurus%} by her brother {%Śakuni%} (who then
returned home), and given to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}. From love for
her future husband she had bandaged her own eyes with
cloth (I, {@110@}).
