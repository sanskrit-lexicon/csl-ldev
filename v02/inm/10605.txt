[{@Suvarṇotpatti@}]¦ (“the origin of gold”). § 747{%b%} (Anuśā-
sanik.). {%Vasiṣṭha%} told to {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%} (and again
{%Bhīṣma%} to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}): After the wedding of {%Rudra%} and
{%Devī%} on {%Himavat%}, all the gods, fearing that {%Rudra's%} offspring
[Page668-a+ 63]
would consume the worlds, prevailed upon him to withdraw
his vital seed (whence he is called {%Ūrdhvaretas%}); {%Umā%} cursed
the gods, saying that they should become sonless; but {%Agni%}
was not present. A small quantity of {%Rudra's%} seed, however,
leaped into {%fire%} and began to develop; mean while, the gods,
with {%Indra%}, were scorched by As. {%Tāraka%}; Ā., V., R., M., A.,
and Sā. all became afflicted; all the regions of the deities, etc.,
and the retreats of Ṛ. were snatched away by As.; D. and Ṛ.
repaired to {%Brahmán%} (XIII, {@84@}), who had granted {%Tāraka%}
the boon that he should not be killed by D., As., or Rā., and
{%Umā%} had cursed D.; {%Brahmán%} said that {%Agni%} was not there;
therefore his offspring, transcending D., Dā., Rā., even G.,
N., and birds, will with his dart destroy {%Tāraka; Kāma%} is
eternal, and in order to slay the enemies of the gods {%Agni%}
will throw {%Rudra's%} seed into the {%Gaṅgā%}. The gods failed to
find out {%Agni%}; a frog, having been scorched by the energy of
{%Agni%}, appeared on the surface of the water, and said to the
gods that {%Agni%} was now under the water; {%Agni%}, leaving the
spot, cursed the frogs, saying that they should be without taste;
the gods granted them boons (enumeration). An elephant
revealed to the gods that {%Agni%} was now residing within a
certain {%aśvattha%} tree; {%Agni%}, entering the heart of the {%śamī%}
tree, cursed all the elephants, saying that their tongues should
be bent back; the gods granted that they should be able
to eat everything and utter indistinct cries. {%Agni%} was
then revealed by a parrot, and cursed the parrots, saying that
they should be deprived of the power of speech; the gods
granted them to speak the letter k, and made {%śamī-%}wood a
sacred resting-place of fire. The waters in the nethermost
regions had come into contact with {%Agni%}, and those heated
waters are vomited forth by the mountain springs. The gods
asked {%Agni%} to rescue D., {%Prajāpatis%}, and Ṛ. from {%Tāraka%} by
begetting a heroic son. {%Agni%} united himself spiritually
with {%Gaṅgā%}; an {%Asura%} uttered a frightful roar; {%Gaṅgā%}
became agitated and unable to bear the seed, and threw it off
on {%Meru%}; the fœtus had the complexion of gold, etc.;
therefore Ṛ. and D. called {%Agni%} by the name of {%Hiraṇyaretas%}
(“having gold for his vital seed”), and the earth {%Vasumatī%}
(“endued with wealth”). That fœtus, having fallen in a
thicket of reeds, assumed a wonderful form; the {%Kṛttikāḥ%}
reared it as their son, whence it came to be called {%Kārttikeya%};
he was also called {%Skanda%} and {%Guha%} (etymology). It was in
this way that gold came into existence as the offspring of
{%Agni (Jātavedas%}), and hence gold was called {%jātarūpa%};
gold is truly the illustrious {%Agni%}, the lord of all things, and
the foremost of all {%Prajāpatis%}; the most sacred of all sacred
things is gold; it has for its essence {%Agni%} and {%Soma%}.—
{%Vasiṣṭha%} continued: This tale ({%Brahmadarśana%}) was also
heard by me in days of yore about {%Brahmán Paramātman%}
(“the Supreme Soul”): In days of yore ({%lokādau%}, v. 4163),
{%Rudra%}, who is {%Brahmán%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), having assumed the form of
{%Varuṇa%} (cf. v. 4133, {%Varuṇaḥ Pāvanātmakaḥ%}), performed a
sacrifice, to which came the {%munis%} and all the deities with
{%Agni%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>).; {%Śiva%} (i.e. {%Rudra%}) then himself poured libations
into his own self. At the sight of the celestial damsels the seed
(endued with {%sattva, rajas%}, and {%tamas%}) of {%Brahmán%} fell upon
the Earth; {%Pūṣan%} took it up, and it was taken with the
sacrificial ladle and poured as an oblation into the fire;
thence {%Brahmán%} caused the orders of beings to spring into
existence; further {%Bhṛgu%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); for this reason {%Agni%} is said
to be all the deities. {%Bhṛgu%} was reckoned the offspring of
{%Varuṇa, Aṅgiras%} that of {%Agni, Kavi%} that of {%Brahmán; Bhṛgu%},
{%Aṅgiras%}, and {%Kavi%} were all of them {%prajānāṃ patayaḥ%}; their
[Page668-b+ 63]
offspring (v. 4144—4152) ({%Bhṛgu's%}: <lang n="greek">η</lang>; {%Aṅgiras'%}: <lang n="greek">θ</lang>; {%Kavi's%}: <lang n="greek">ι</lang>)
are called {%Vāruṇāḥ%}, and {%Kavi%} and {%Bhṛgu Vāruṇau. Agni%} is
{%Brahmán, Paśupati%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>); gold is the offspring of {%Agni%}
(v. 4146); when fire is not obtainable gold is used as a
substitute, oh {%Jāmadagnya!%} (B. and C. wrongly read {%Jāma-%}
{%dagnyaḥ%}, which PCR. translates “one that knows the identity
of gold with fire”) by one who is conversant with the vedic
authorities (v. 4165), etc. (v. 4166—7); {%Agni%} sprang from
{%Brahmán%}, and from {%Agni%} sprang gold (v. 4168); those
persons observant of righteousness who make gifts of gold are
regarded as giving away all the deities (v. 4169), etc.; he
who makes a gift of gold at the second twilight succeeds in
attaining to residence with ({%sālokyaṃ) Brahmán, Vāyu, Agni%},
and {%Soma%} (v. 4173), and to the regions of {%Indra%} (v. 4174),
etc.; he has never to fall down from the regions to which he
attains (v. 4176). After a long time {%Kārttikeya%} grew up,
and was chosen as generalissimo by all the gods with {%Indra%};
he slew Dai. {%Tāraka%} and many other {%Asuras. Bhīṣma%}
continued: “Thus addressed by {%Vasiṣṭha%} [Rāma] {%Jāma-%}
{%dagnya%} made gifts of gold to the brahmans and became
cleansed of his sins” (XIII, {@85@}). [For continuation v.
{%Tārakavadhopākhyāna%} (§ 748).]
