[{@Haṃsakākīyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the story of the crow
<div n="lb">and the swans”). § 606 (Karṇap.): There lived on the
<div n="lb">other side of the ocean a rich {%vaiśya%} with many children, kind
<div n="lb">to all creatures. A crow lived upon the refuse of the dishes
<div n="lb">set before these children. The crow, becoming arrogant, came
<div n="lb">to disregard all birds. Once, certain swans, having their
<div n="lb">abodes in the {%Mānasa%} lake, came to that side of the ocean.
<div n="lb">The crow challenged their leader, saying that he would
<div n="lb">display 101 different kinds of motion, doing every 100 {%yojanas%}
<div n="lb">in a separate kind of motion: rising up and swooping down,
<div n="lb">etc. One of the swans said that they knew but that one kind
<div n="lb">of motion that all birds know, at which the assembled crows
<div n="lb">laughed aloud. The swans in vain tried to dissuade the crow.
<div n="lb">They began to fly. Beholding the diverse kinds of flight of
<div n="lb">the crow, the crows loudly rejoiced, while the swans laughed
<div n="lb">in mockery. For a moment the swan, with that one kind of
<div n="lb">slow motion, seemed to yield to the crow. As the swan flew
<div n="lb">westwards to the ocean, the crow was anxious and became
<div n="lb">almost senseless at not seeing any islands or trees whereon to
<div n="lb">perch when tired. At last the swan asked: “What is this
<div n="lb">kind of flight that thou hast now adopted? thou touchest the
<div n="lb">waters with thy wings and beak repeatedly.” The crow
<div n="lb">suddenly fell down, and imploring the swan, prevailed upon
<div n="lb">him to take him on his back and carry him to the shore, and
<div n="lb">promised never to disregard others.
