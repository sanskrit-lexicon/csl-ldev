[{@Haṃsakākīyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the story of the crow
and the swans”). § 606 (Karṇap.): There lived on the
other side of the ocean a rich {%vaiśya%} with many children, kind
to all creatures. A crow lived upon the refuse of the dishes
set before these children. The crow, becoming arrogant, came
to disregard all birds. Once, certain swans, having their
abodes in the {%Mānasa%} lake, came to that side of the ocean.
The crow challenged their leader, saying that he would
display 101 different kinds of motion, doing every 100 {%yojanas%}
in a separate kind of motion: rising up and swooping down,
etc. One of the swans said that they knew but that one kind
of motion that all birds know, at which the assembled crows
laughed aloud. The swans in vain tried to dissuade the crow.
They began to fly. Beholding the diverse kinds of flight of
the crow, the crows loudly rejoiced, while the swans laughed
in mockery. For a moment the swan, with that one kind of
slow motion, seemed to yield to the crow. As the swan flew
westwards to the ocean, the crow was anxious and became
almost senseless at not seeing any islands or trees whereon to
perch when tired. At last the swan asked: “What is this
kind of flight that thou hast now adopted? thou touchest the
waters with thy wings and beak repeatedly.” The crow
suddenly fell down, and imploring the swan, prevailed upon
him to take him on his back and carry him to the shore, and
promised never to disregard others.
