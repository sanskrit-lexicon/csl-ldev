[{@Bhava-Bhārgava-samāgama(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the meeting of
Śiva and Uśanas”). § 701{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said:
{%Uśanas%} became engaged in doing what was disagreeable to the
gods for an adequate cause (v. the note of PCR., p. 524).
{%Kubera%}, the chief of Y. and Rā., is the lord of the treasury of
{%Indra. Uśanas%}, by {%yoga%}, entered {%Kubera%}, and deprived him
of his liberty and robbed him of all his wealth. {%Kubera%}
repaired to {%Śiva%}, who prepared to slay {%Uśanas%} with his lance.
{%Uśanas%} placed himself on the point of {%Śiva's%} lance. {%Śiva%}
bent the lance with his hand ({%pāṇinā samanāmayat%}), whence
[Page127-a+ 63]
it was called {%Pināka%}, and threw {%Uśanas%} into his mouth and
swallowed him, and {%Uśanas%} began to wander there. {%Mahādeva%}
entered the waters and remained there like an immovable
stake of wood for millions of years. Then he rose from the
mighty lake and {%Brahmán%} approached him. {%Śiva%} saw that
{%Uśanas%} within his stomach (Nīl.) had become greater in con-
sequence of those penances of his. He once more betook
himself to {%yoga-%}meditation. {%Uśanas%}, filled with anxiety,
began to wander within his stomach, and to sing his praises;
but {%Rudra%} had stopped all his outlets; at last he let him go
out through his urethra. Thence he came to be called {%Śukra%},
and became unable to attain the central point of the firmament.
{%Umā%} prevented {%Śiva%} from slaying him, and {%Uśanas%} became
her son (XII, {@290@}).
