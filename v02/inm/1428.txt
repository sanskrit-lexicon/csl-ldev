[{@Bhava-Bhārgava-samāgama(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the meeting of
<div n="lb">Śiva and Uśanas”). § 701{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said:
<div n="lb">{%Uśanas%} became engaged in doing what was disagreeable to the
<div n="lb">gods for an adequate cause (v. the note of PCR., p. 524).
<div n="lb">{%Kubera,%} the chief of Y. and Rā., is the lord of the treasury of
<div n="lb">{%Indra. Uśanas,%} by {%yoga,%} entered {%Kubera,%} and deprived him
<div n="lb">of his liberty and robbed him of all his wealth. {%Kubera%}
<div n="lb">repaired to {%Śiva,%} who prepared to slay {%Uśanas%} with his lance.
<div n="lb">{%Uśanas%} placed himself on the point of {%Śiva's%} lance. {%Śiva%}
<div n="lb">bent the lance with his hand {%(pāṇinā samanāmayat),%} whence
[Page127-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">it was called {%Pināka,%} and threw {%Uśanas%} into his mouth and
<div n="lb">swallowed him, and {%Uśanas%} began to wander there. {%Mahādeva%}
<div n="lb">entered the waters and remained there like an immovable
<div n="lb">stake of wood for millions of years. Then he rose from the
<div n="lb">mighty lake and {%Brahmán%} approached him. {%Śiva%} saw that
<div n="lb">{%Uśanas%} within his stomach (Nīl.) had become greater in con-
<div n="lb">sequence of those penances of his. He once more betook
<div n="lb">himself to {%yoga-%}meditation. {%Uśanas,%} filled with anxiety,
<div n="lb">began to wander within his stomach, and to sing his praises;
<div n="lb">but {%Rudra%} had stopped all his outlets; at last he let him go
<div n="lb">out through his urethra. Thence he came to be called {%Śukra,%}
<div n="lb">and became unable to attain the central point of the firmament.
<div n="lb">{%Umā%} prevented {%Śiva%} from slaying him, and {%Uśanas%} became
<div n="lb">her son (XII, {@290@}).
