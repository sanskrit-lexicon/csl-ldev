{@Anudyūtaparvan.@}¦ § 302: When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had left
<div n="lb">Hāstinapura with all their wealth and jewels, {%Duḥśāsana%}
<div n="lb">complained of it to {%Duryodhana,%} who, with {%Karṇa%} and
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni,%} quoting the words of {%Bṛhaspati%} when counselling
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} about politics, and declaring that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would
<div n="lb">certainly revenge themselves, prevailed upon {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">to invite them a second time to a match of gambling between
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Śakuni,%} on the condition that the defeated
<div n="lb">party should repair to the woods for twelve years, dressed in
<div n="lb">deer-skins, and spend the thirteenth year in some inhabited
<div n="lb">country unrecognized, and if recognized, be exiled for another
[Page056-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">twelve years. If the {%Pāṇḍavas%} should succeed in observing
<div n="lb">this vow for thirteen years, the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} would in the
<div n="lb">meantime have made alliances and have assembled an invincible
<div n="lb">army, so that they could defeat them if they reappeared.
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa, Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Gautama, Vidura, Aśvatthāman,%}
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśyāputra%} (i.e. {%Yuyutsu%}), {%Bhūriśravas, Bhīṣma,%} and {%Vikarṇa%}
<div n="lb">dissuaded in vain (II, {@74@}).—§ 303: {%Gāndhārī%} reminded
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of the counsel {%Vidura%} had given, when {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} was born, to kill him, and recommended him to do it
<div n="lb">now, and not to let the gambling match take place, saying
<div n="lb">that it would cause the destruction of the whole race of the
<div n="lb">{%Kurus.%} But {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} could not act contrary to the
<div n="lb">will of his sons (II, {@75@}).—§ 304: The royal messengers
<div n="lb">overtook {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} when he had already gone a long way.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} having said, “Although a golden animal was
<div n="lb">an impossibility, {%Rāma%} suffered himself to be tempted by
<div n="lb">a golden deer,” they returned. The gambling began on the
<div n="lb">above-mentioned conditions (cf. III, 1362 ff., where the
<div n="lb">conditions are stated somewhat differently), and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">lost (II, {@76@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas,%} casting off their royal robes,
<div n="lb">attired themselves in deer-skins. {%Duḥśāsana%} exulted, and
<div n="lb">exhorted {%Kṛṣṇā%} to abandon the fallen {%Pāṇḍavas%} and choose
<div n="lb">a husband among the {%Kurus.%} As {%Bhīma%} rebuked him and
<div n="lb">threatened to slay him with his followers, {%Duḥśāsana,%} dancing
<div n="lb">around, said, “O cow! O cow!” {%Bhīṣma%} again swore to drink
<div n="lb">his blood and to kill all the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras.%} As the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">were going away, {%Duryodhana%} mimicked the tread of {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">who then said: “I will slay {%Duryodhana%} with my mace, and
<div n="lb">place my foot on his head. {%Dhanañjaya%} will slay {%Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sahadeva%} will slay {%Śakuni,%} and I will drink the blood of
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana.%}” {%Arjuna%} and {%Sahadeva%} approved of it. {%Nakula,%}
<div n="lb">“the handsomest of men,” vowed to kill all the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
<div n="lb">that had insulted {%Draupadī%} (II, {@77@}).—§ 305: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">bids farewell to {%Bhīṣma, Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Droṇa, Kṛpa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman, Vidura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
<div n="lb">{%Yuyutsu, Sañjaya,%} etc. {%Vidura%} kept {%Pṛthā%} in his abode, and
<div n="lb">consoled {%Yudhiṣṭhira:%} “Formerly thou wast instructed on
<div n="lb">the {%Himavat%} by {%Meru-Sāvarṇi,%} in {%Vāraṇāvata%} by {%Dvaipāyana,%}
<div n="lb">on {%Bhṛgutuṅga%} by {%Rāma,%} on the {%Dṛṣadvatī%} by {%Śambhu,%}
<div n="lb">near {%Añjana%} by the great {%ṛṣi Asita,%} by {%Bhṛgu%} on the banks
<div n="lb">of {%Kalmāṣī; Nārada%} always beholds thee, and this {%Dhaumya%}
<div n="lb">is thy {%purohita,%}—resolve to win victory like {%Indra,%} to control
<div n="lb">thy wrath like {%Yama,%} to give in charity like {%Kuvera,%} to control
<div n="lb">all passions like {%Varuṇa.%}” So {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} went away,
<div n="lb">bowing to {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa,%} (II, {@78@}). When {%Kṛṣṇā%}
<div n="lb">took leave of {%Kuntī, Kuntī%} broke out in complaints, and
<div n="lb">especially recommended her ever to keep her eye on {%Sahadeva.%}
<div n="lb">When {%Kuntī%} beheld her sons clad in deer-skins, surrounded
<div n="lb">by rejoicing foes, she embraced them and broke out in com-
<div n="lb">plaints, asking why {%Kṛṣṇa,%} who dwells in {%Dvārakā,%} and is
<div n="lb">without beginning and without end, does not deliver them
<div n="lb">from such woe. “O {%Sahadeva!%} cease to go! thou art my
<div n="lb">dearest child, O son of {%Mādrī!%}” The {%Pāṇḍavas,%} having
<div n="lb">consoled her, set out for the woods, and {%Vidura%} led her to his
<div n="lb">house. The ladies of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} house wept, blaming the
<div n="lb">{%Kauravas;%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} anxious, sent for {%Vidura%} (II,
<div n="lb">{@79@}).—§ 306: Questioned by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura%} described
<div n="lb">the attitude of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} etc., when going away (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">The citizens cried out in grief, blaming the {%Kurus.%} Flashings
<div n="lb">of lightning and other terrible omens appeared. {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">appeared, surrounded by great {%ṛṣis,%} and foreboded that on
<div n="lb">the fourteenth year thence the {%Kauravas%} would all be destroyed
<div n="lb">by {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna.%} Then he disappeared through the
[Page057-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">skies. {%Duryodhana, Karṇa,%} and {%Śakuni%} offered the kingdom
<div n="lb">to {%Droṇa,%} who said that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were incapable of
<div n="lb">being slain; that they would practise the {%brahmacarya%} for
<div n="lb">twelve years, and then return in anger; that he {%(Droṇa)%}
<div n="lb">would protect the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} who had sought his pro-
<div n="lb">tection, to the best of his ability; but that he would himself
<div n="lb">be slain by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} whom {%Drupada%} had obtained
<div n="lb">(together with {%Kṛṣṇā%}) from the fire by the ascetic power of
<div n="lb">{%Yāja%} and {%Upayāja;%} “it is widely known in the world that
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} will slay {%Droṇa.%}” {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} sent {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">to bring the {%Pāṇḍavas%} back, or, if they did not come back, to
<div n="lb">send them off with respect, with their weapons, cars, and
<div n="lb">infantry, etc. (II, {@80@}).—§ 307: {%Sañjaya%} spoke to
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} about the perversity of his policy. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">related that when {%Kṛṣṇā%} was dragged into the court the
<div n="lb">grief was so great that the enraged brahmans did not that
<div n="lb">evening perform their {%agnihotra;%} he also related the omens
<div n="lb">which had appeared on the occasion, etc. (II, {@81@}).
