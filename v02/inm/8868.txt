{@[Putradarśanaparvan]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
seeing of the sons,” the 96th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
cf. Putradarśana). § 789: {%Janamejaya%} said: Tell me what
that wonderful feat was which M.-ṛ. {%Vyāsa%} accomplished after
his promise to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} when he had taken up his abode
in the forest with {%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī%}, and after {%Vidura%} had
left his body and entered into {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and when all the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} were in the ascetic retreat; for how many days did
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} stay with his men in the woods; on what food
did the {%Pāṇḍavas%} support themselves with their men and wives?
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} passed about a month in
that forest, supporting themselves on diverse kinds of food
and drink. Then {%Vyāsa%} came there and {%Nārada%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>);
they sat down on sacred seats [of {%kuśa%} grass] and on seats of
peacock feathers; {%Gāndhārī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) also sat down; they
spoke of Ṛ., D., and As. Then {%Vyāsa%} said that he knew that
burning grief in the heart of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); “let
D., G., and M.-ṛ. to-day behold the energy of my penances;
therefore tell me what wish of thine I shall grant to-day.”
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wished to see his dead children and kinsmen,
mentioning {%Duryodhana%} and the slaughter of {%Bhīṣma%} and
{%Droṇa%}. Hearing this the grief of {%Gāndhārī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) became
fresh; {%Gāndhārī%} said that for sixteen years {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} never
had slept for grief; and also {%Kṛṣṇā%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>) grieved
exceedingly. {%Vyāsa%} then asked {%Kuntī%} to tell what she
wished (XV, {@29@}). {%Kuntī%} told the story of {%Karṇa's%} birth
(mentioning {%Durvāsas%}, etc.); {%Vyāsa%} promised to show her
[Page573-a+ 63]
{%Karṇa%}, and said that she had no fault in what had happened
about the birth of {%Karṇa%}; “the gods beget after five methods
(thought, word, sight, touch, and sexual union)” (XV, {@30@})
{%Vyāsa%} promised to show everyone the persons whom they
wished to see and who were in the other world (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); “they were
all portions of D.; both G., Aps., Pś., Gh., Rā., {%Puṇyajanāḥ%},
Si., D.-ṛ., D., and Dā. met with death on the battlefield of
{%Kurukṣetra%}”; he explained who among the dead, etc., was
what: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was the {%Gandharva%} king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>). They all, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with his ministers and the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and Ṛ. and G., proceeded towards the Bhāgīrathī
and waited for the advent of night; at sunset they bathed
and finished their evening rites (XV, {@31@}). When night
came, {%Vyāsa%} plunged into the Bhāgīrathī for a bath, and
summoned all the deceased warriors, who all rose up from
the water with a loud uproar, everyone presenting the same
aspect that he did when clad for battle; there were {%Bhīṣma%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>); all of them were now robed in celestial vestments
and had brilliant earrings; they were free from all animosity,
etc.; G. sang their praises, etc.; each of them was waited
upon by bands of Aps. {%Vyāsa%} gave {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} celestial
vision; endued with celestial knowledge, {%Gāndhārī%} saw all
the slain; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became full of joy (XV, {@32@}).
Divested of wrath and malice, the spirits of the dead mingled
with the living in happy converse (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>). Having sported with
one another for that night they, taking leave from each other,
returned to the places they had come from (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), {%Vyāsa%}
dismissing them within the twinkling of an eye; of Rā. and
Pś. some proceeded to the {%Uttarakurus%}, others to the gods.
With {%Vyāsa's%} permission, many widows plunged into the
waters of the Bhāgīrathī in order to accompany their deceased
lords, and proceeded to those regions where their husbands
had found their abodes. {%Vyāsa%} granted to all the men there
assembled the fruition of their wishes. People of diverse
realms, hearing of this meeting between the dead and living,
became highly delighted (XV, {@33@}).—§ 790: {%Sauti%} said:
{%Janamejaya%} filled with joy asked {%Vaiśampāyana%}, how it is
possible for persons whose bodies have been destroyed to
reappear in those very forms. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Acts are
never destroyed; bodies are born of acts; so also are features,
etc., quoting a {%śruti%} in the horse-sacrifice (XV, {@34@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had never beheld his own sons, but got spiritual
vision from {%Vyāsa%}, he had learnt all the royal duties, as also
the {%Vedas%} and {%Upaniṣads; Vidura%} attained to high success
through penances. {%Janamejaya%} said: If {%Vyāsa%} shows me my
father as he was when he died I may then believe all that thou
hast told me. {%Sauti%} said: Then {%Vyāsa%} brought {%Parikṣit%}
[from the other world], and {%Śamīka%} and his son {%Śṛṅgin%};
all the counsellors and ministers of the king beheld them.
{%Janamejaya%}, performing the final bath in his sacrifice, highly
rejoiced; he poured the sacred water over his father, as also
over himself; then he said to {%Āstīka%} that this his sacrifice was
fraught with many wonderful incidents; {%Āstīka%} praised
{%Vyāsa%} and the snake-sacrifice, from which {%Takṣaka%} had with
difficulty escaped, the worship of Ṛ., etc. {%Janamejaya%}
honoured {%Āstīka%}, and then asked Ṛ. {%Vaiśampāyana%} about
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} further residence in the woods (XV, {@35@}).—
§ 791: {%Janamejaya%} said: Having seen his sons, etc., what
did {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and king {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} also, do? {%Vaiśampā-%}
{%yana%} said: Beholding that wonderful sight, the reappearance
of his children, R.-ṛ. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became relieved of his
grief and returned to his retreat; the people and Ṛ., dismissed
by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, returned home. {%Vyāsa%} came and asked
[Page573-b+ 59]
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to dismiss the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (“thou hast heard
discourses from Ṛ., the mysteries of D. from {%Nārada%}, etc.”),
who now had passed more than a month in the woods.
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} affectionately, and
dismissed him and his brothers. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} offered to
wait upon his uncle and his two mothers; {%Gāndhārī%} dissuaded
him from that step. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that his mind was
wholly set upon penances, as the whole earth were empty now,
etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) {%Sahadeva%}, saying that he dared not leave his mother,
urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to return to the capital; he would
himself remain, engaged in penances and in serving the old
king and his mothers. {%Kuntī%} affectionately dissuaded her
sons from remaining with her and thereby obstructing her
penances. They then took leave of their mother and
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who blessed and comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">β</lang>), and embraced them one after another. Then {%Gāndhārī%}
blessed them, and {%Kuntī%} kissed them on their heads, etc.
{%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī%} embraced {%Draupadī%}, etc., and instructed
them. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his wives and troops and kinsmen
set out for {%Hāstinapura%} (XV, {@36@}).
