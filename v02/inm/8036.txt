[{@Pāṇḍurājyābhiṣeka@}]¦ (“anointing of Pāṇḍu as a
king”). § 173 (Sambhavap.): Upon the birth of those
three children (§ 171), {%Kurujāṅgala, Kurukṣetra%}, and the
{%Kurus%} grew in prosperity, etc. The southern {%Kurus%}, in
virtuous rivalry with the northern {%Kurus%}, walked about
in the company of gods, {%ṛṣis%}, and {%Cāraṇas%}. Virtuously
[Page536-b+ 63]
ruled by {%Bhīṣma%}, the kingdom was adorned with hundreds
of {%caityas%} and {%yūpas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu%}, and {%Vidura%}
were brought up by {%Bhīṣma%} as if they were his own
children, and became well exercised in archery, etc., and
well read in the {%Itihāsas%} and {%Purāṇas%} and various sciences,
and the {%Vedas%} and {%Vedāṅgas. Pāṇḍu%} excelled all men in
archery, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} in personal strength, {%Vidura%} in devotion
to virtue. {%Hāstinapura%} was the foremost among cities. Because
of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} blindness and {%Vidura's%} being a {%pārasava%} (son
of a {%brahman%} with a {%śūdra%} woman), {%Pāṇḍu%} became king.
One day {%Bhīṣma%} addressed {%Vidura%} [about the marriage of
the two princes] (I, {@109@}).
