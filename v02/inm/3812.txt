[{@Duryodhana-yajña(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the sacrifice of Duryo-
<div n="lb">dhana”). § 516 (Ghoṣay., cf. Karṇadigv.): {%Karṇa%} proposed
<div n="lb">to {%Duryodhana%} that he should celebrate a {%rājasūya%} sacrifice
<div n="lb">like {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%} But as the {%purohita%} told him that so
<div n="lb">long as {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} were living he could
<div n="lb">not undertake the {%rājasūya%} sacrifice, and advised him to cause
<div n="lb">the tributary kings to pay him tribute in gold, and with that
<div n="lb">gold to make a plough, and to plough the sacrificial compound
<div n="lb">with it, and then to perform a {%Vaiṣṇava%} sacrifice that nobody
<div n="lb">had performed before save the ancient {%Viṣṇu%} (v. 15292,
<div n="lb">cf. v. 15329 foll.) which was equal to the {%rājasūya,%} this plan
<div n="lb">was agreed upon. {%Duryodhana%} appointed persons to their
<div n="lb">respective tasks, and desired all the artisans to construct the
<div n="lb">plough, etc. (III, {@255@}). When {%Vidura%} had announced to
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that the preparations had been made, messengers
<div n="lb">were dispatched to invite the princes and the {%brahmans.%}
<div n="lb">{%Duḥśāsana%} ordered one messenger to invite the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} but
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} replied that they could not come before the com—
<div n="lb">pletion of the thirteenth year. {%Bhīma%} threatened; the other
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} said nothing unpleasant. {%Vidura%} was charged with
<div n="lb">the distribution of food to the guests. After the completion of
<div n="lb">the sacrifice, all the kings having been dismissed, {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">with his brothers and {%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni,%} entered {%Hāstinapura%}
<div n="lb">(III, {@256@}). {%Duryodhana%} was praised by most of the citizens,
<div n="lb">and his friends compared him to {%Yayāti, Nahuṣa, Māndhātṛ,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Bharata,%} who had gone to heaven after celebrating this
<div n="lb">sacrifice (v. 15329 foll., cf. v. 15292). {%Karṇa%} said that when
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} had slain the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in battle and completed
<div n="lb">the {%rājasūya%} sacrifice he would once more honour him thus,
<div n="lb">and promised that until he had slain {%Arjuna%} he would not
<div n="lb">allow his feet to be washed, nor taste meat, and he would
<div n="lb">observe the {%Asura%} vow (i.e. not to drink intoxicating liquors,
<div n="lb">Nīl.), and never refuse to give to whoever might solicit him.
