{@Prayāga@},¦ a tīrtha at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the
Yamunā. § 61 (Sarpasattra): I, {@55@}, 2097 (there Soma,
Varuṇa, and Prajāpati had performed sacrifices).—§ 373
(cf. Tīrthayātrāp.): At {%P.%}, whose praise has been sung by
{%ṛṣis%}, the gods dwell with {%Brahmán%} at their head, further
the quarters with their presiding deities ({%sadigīśvarāḥ%}), the
{%Lokapālas%}, the {%Sādhyas%}, the {%Pitṛs%}, the great {%ṛṣis (para-%}
{%marṣayaḥ) Sanatkumāra%}, etc., the stainless {%Brahmarṣis%},
{%Aṅgiras%}, etc., the {%Nāgas%}, the {%Suparṇas%}, the {%Siddhas%}, the
{%cakracaras%} (i.e. the Sun, etc., Nīl., cf. BR., “Snakes,” PCR.),
the rivers, the seas, the {%Gandharvas%}, the {%Apsarases%}, and
{%Hari%} with {%Prajāpati%}. There are three fire caverns ({%agni-%}
{%kuṇḍāni%}) between which the Gaṅgā, that foremost of {%tīrthas%},
rolls rapidly. There the world-purifying daughter of the
Sun ({%Tapanasya) Yamunā%} unites with the Gaṅgā. The
country between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā is regarded as
the mons Veneris ({%jaghanaṃ%}) of the Earth, and the ṛṣis
regard {%P%}. as its genitals ({%upasthaṃ). P%}. with {%Pratiṣṭhāna%},
{%Kambala%}, and {%Aśvatara%} and the {%tīrtha Bhogavatī%} constitute the
altar ({%vediḥ%}) of Prajāpati. There the {%Vedas%} and the sacrifices
in their embodied forms and the ṛṣis adore {%Prajāpati%}; there
the gods and rulers of territories ({%cakradharāḥ%}) perform their
sacrifices; therefore {%P%}. is the most sacred in the three worlds
and the foremost of all {%tīrthas%}. By going thither, by praising
it, etc., one is cleansed from sin, etc., and he who bathes
there obtains the merit of a {%rājasūya%} and an {%aśvamedha%}.
“Let not the words of the {%Vedas%} nor the words of men
dissuade thy mind from the desire of dying at {%P%}.” There
are 600,010,000 {%tīrthas%} at {%P%}. By only bathing there one
acquires the merits of the four kinds of knowledge ({%cāturvidye%},
i.e. the three Vedas and the {%ātmavidyā%}, Nīl.) and of the
truthful ({%satyavādiṣu%}): III, {@85@}, 8212, 8218, 8219 ({%sa-%}
