{@Astradarśana@}¦ (“the show of arms”). § 208 (Sambhav.):
<div n="lb">I, {@134:@} When the princes had become accomplished in arms
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} addressed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} in the presence of {%Kṛpa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Bhīṣma, Vyāsa,%} and {%Vidura,%} asking
<div n="lb">him to let them show their proficiency. {%Vidura%} then let
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} measure out a place, and {%Kuntī, Gāndhārī,%} etc. (“like
<div n="lb">celestial ladies ascending {%Meru%}”), and the citizens came out
<div n="lb">to behold the princes' skill. {%Droṇa%} and {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">appeared like the Moon {%(Aṃśumat)%} accompanied by the
<div n="lb">planet Mars {%(Aṅgāraka).%} The spectators, seeing the prowess
<div n="lb">of the princes, fancied they were beholding the city of the
<div n="lb">{%Gandharvas. Vidura%} described all the feats of the princes
<div n="lb">to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and {%Kuntī%} to {%Gāndhārī%} (I, {@134@}). A combat
<div n="lb">with maces between {%Duryodhana%} and {%Bhīma%} divided the
<div n="lb">spectators into two parties, until {%Droṇa%} caused {%Aśvatthāman%}
<div n="lb">to separate them. The exploits of {%Arjuna (b)%} were quite
<div n="lb">wonderful. {%Droṇa%} stood surrounded by the five {%Pārthas%}
<div n="lb">like the Moon in conjunction with the five-starred {%Sāvitra%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. {%Hasta%}), and {%Duryodhana,%} mace in hand, surrounded by his
<div n="lb">100 brothers and {%Aśvatthāman,%} was like {%Purandara%} (i.e. {%Indra%})
<div n="lb">encircled by the hosts of gods on the occasion of the victory
<div n="lb">over the {%Dānavas%} (I, {@135@}). {%Karṇa (c)%} enters and challenges
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna.%} The {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} stood by {%Karṇa,%} while {%Droṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa,%} and {%Bhīṣma%} remained with {%Arjuna. Kuntī%} swooned
<div n="lb">away, and was restored to consciousness by {%Vidura,%} who
<div n="lb">caused sandal paste and water to be sprinkled on her person.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa%} rejects {%Karṇa;%} but {%Duryodhana%} then installed {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">as king of {%Aṅga%} (I, {@136@}). The sun went down; {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">led {%Karṇa%} out of the arena, and the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} accompanied
<div n="lb">by {%Droṇa, Kṛpa,%} and {%Bhīṣma,%} returned to their abodes
<div n="lb">(I, {@137@}).
