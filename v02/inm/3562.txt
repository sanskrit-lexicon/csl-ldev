[{@Dhundhumāropākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode about the
<div n="lb">slayer of Dhundhu”). Cf. Dhaundumāra(ṃ) upākhyāna(ṃ).
<div n="lb">§ 474 (Mārkaṇḍ.): The great {%ṛṣi Uttaṅka,%} in his hermitage
<div n="lb">in the wilderness, by severe penances for numberless years
<div n="lb">obtained that {%Viṣṇu%} appeared to him, and having been praised
<div n="lb">by him (vv. 13494—13503) (<lang n="greek"></lang>), granted him that he should
<div n="lb">always remain virtuous and devoted to {%Viṣṇu,%} and that he
<div n="lb">should obtain a {%yoga%} power and urge {%Kuvalāśva%} (son of
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhadaśva%} of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race), who had been furnished with
<div n="lb">{%yoga%} power from {%Viṣṇu,%} to kill the Asura {%Dhundhu%} (III,
<div n="lb">{@201@}).—§ 475: After the death of {%Ikṣvāku, Śaśāda%} was
<div n="lb">king in {%Ayodhyā.%} List of Śaśāda's descendants; {%Śaśāda>%}
<div n="lb">{%Kakutstha> Anenas> Pṛthu> Viśvagaśva> Adri> Yuvanāśva>%}
<div n="lb">{%Śrāva> Śrāvastaka%} (who built {%Śrāvastī%})> {%Bṛhadaśva> Kuva-%}
<div n="lb">{%lāśva>%} 21,000 sons.—§ 476: Having installed {%Kuvalāśva%}
<div n="lb">on the throne, {%Bṛhadaśva%} retired into the forest as an ascetic.
<div n="lb">Then {%Uttaṅka%} asked him first to slay the {%Daitya%} chief {%Dhundhu%}
<div n="lb">(son of {%Madhu%} and {%Kaiṭabha%}), who dwelt underground in the
<div n="lb">sea {%Ujjālaka,%} which was full of sand, in the desert, practised
<div n="lb">austerities with a view to destroy the gods and the three worlds,
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} having granted him that he could not be slain by gods,
<div n="lb">{%Daityas, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas,%} and {%Gandhervas.%} “Every year,
<div n="lb">when he sleeps covered with sand and begins to breathe, the
<div n="lb">earth trembles for seven days, and the sand raised by his breath
<div n="lb">shrouds the sun.” He then told him the boon granted by {%Viṣṇu%}
<div n="lb">(see § 474) (III, {@202@}). They agreed that {%Kuvalāśva%} should
<div n="lb">slay the {%Daitya,%} and {%Bṛhadaśva%} retired to the forest.—§ 477:
<div n="lb">Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: During the
<div n="lb">cataclysm, when {%Viṣṇu,%} wearing a crown and the {%Kaustubha,%}
<div n="lb">and dressed in yellow {%(pīta)%} silk, stretched over many {%yojanas,%}
[Page254-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">lay sleeping on the hood of {%Śeṣa,%} who encircled the earth, and
<div n="lb">a lotus sprang from his navel, and from that lotus {%Brahmán,%}
<div n="lb">who is the four {%Vedas%} with four faces, the {%Dānavas Madhu%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kaiṭabha%} began to terrify {%Brahmán. Viṣṇu%} awoke,
<div n="lb">and offered to grant them a boon, and as they wished to
<div n="lb">grant him a boon, he chose that they should be slain by
<div n="lb">him, and at their request he promised to slay them on
<div n="lb">a wholly uncovered spot, and that they should become
<div n="lb">his sons; as only his thighs were uncovered, he there cut
<div n="lb">off their heads with his discus (III, {@203@}).—§ 478: Their
<div n="lb">son was {%Dhundhu.%} Description of his penances, and the
<div n="lb">boon he obtained from {%Brahmán,%} etc. (see § 476). When
<div n="lb">{%Kuvalāśva,%} with his 21,000 sons and his troops, and {%Uttaṅka%}
<div n="lb">set out, and aërial voice was heard, the gods showered flowers,
<div n="lb">etc., and the gods, {%Gandharvas,%} and great {%ṛṣis%} came to
<div n="lb">behold the encounter. At the request of {%Uttaṅka, Viṣṇu%}
<div n="lb">filled {%Kuvalāśva%} with his own energy. He let his sons
<div n="lb">excavate the sea of sands in seven days, and then they
<div n="lb">aroused the {%Dānava,%} assailing him with arrows, etc. He
<div n="lb">swallowed the arrows and vomited flames, which consumed
<div n="lb">all the sons of {%Kuvalāśva,%} but were extinguished by a stream
<div n="lb">of water flowing from the body of {%Kuvalāśva,%} who then
<div n="lb">burnt him with the {%Brahmāstra,%} whence he was named
<div n="lb">{%Dhundhumāra%} (“slayer of Dhundhu”). The gods and great
<div n="lb">{%ṛṣis%} granted him the boon that he should always be able
<div n="lb">to give wealth to brahmans, etc. Then the gods and great
<div n="lb">{%ṛṣis%} went away to their abodes. {%Kuvalāśva%} had three sons
<div n="lb">left—{%Dṛḍhāśva, Kapilāśva,%} and {%Candrāśva,%} from whom
<div n="lb">sprang the {%Ikṣvāku%} kings. Blessing upon the reader
<div n="lb">(III, {@204@}).
