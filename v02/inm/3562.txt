[{@Dhundhumāropākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode about the
slayer of Dhundhu”). Cf. Dhaundumāra(ṃ) upākhyāna(ṃ).
§ 474 (Mārkaṇḍ.): The great {%ṛṣi Uttaṅka%}, in his hermitage
in the wilderness, by severe penances for numberless years
obtained that {%Viṣṇu%} appeared to him, and having been praised
by him (vv. 13494—13503) (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), granted him that he should
always remain virtuous and devoted to {%Viṣṇu%}, and that he
should obtain a {%yoga%} power and urge {%Kuvalāśva%} (son of
{%Bṛhadaśva%} of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race), who had been furnished with
{%yoga%} power from {%Viṣṇu%}, to kill the Asura {%Dhundhu%} (III,
{@201@}).—§ 475: After the death of {%Ikṣvāku, Śaśāda%} was
king in {%Ayodhyā%}. List of Śaśāda's descendants; {%Śaśāda>%}
{%Kakutstha> Anenas> Pṛthu> Viśvagaśva> Adri> Yuvanāśva>%}
{%Śrāva> Śrāvastaka%} (who built {%Śrāvastī%})> {%Bṛhadaśva> Kuva-%}
{%lāśva>%} 21,000 sons.—§ 476: Having installed {%Kuvalāśva%}
on the throne, {%Bṛhadaśva%} retired into the forest as an ascetic.
Then {%Uttaṅka%} asked him first to slay the {%Daitya%} chief {%Dhundhu%}
(son of {%Madhu%} and {%Kaiṭabha%}), who dwelt underground in the
sea {%Ujjālaka%}, which was full of sand, in the desert, practised
austerities with a view to destroy the gods and the three worlds,
{%Brahmán%} having granted him that he could not be slain by gods,
{%Daityas, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas%}, and {%Gandhervas%}. “Every year,
when he sleeps covered with sand and begins to breathe, the
earth trembles for seven days, and the sand raised by his breath
shrouds the sun.” He then told him the boon granted by {%Viṣṇu%}
(see § 474) (III, {@202@}). They agreed that {%Kuvalāśva%} should
slay the {%Daitya%}, and {%Bṛhadaśva%} retired to the forest.—§ 477:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: During the
cataclysm, when {%Viṣṇu%}, wearing a crown and the {%Kaustubha%},
and dressed in yellow ({%pīta%}) silk, stretched over many {%yojanas%},
[Page254-a+ 63]
lay sleeping on the hood of {%Śeṣa%}, who encircled the earth, and
a lotus sprang from his navel, and from that lotus {%Brahmán%},
who is the four {%Vedas%} with four faces, the {%Dānavas Madhu%}
and {%Kaiṭabha%} began to terrify {%Brahmán. Viṣṇu%} awoke,
and offered to grant them a boon, and as they wished to
grant him a boon, he chose that they should be slain by
him, and at their request he promised to slay them on
a wholly uncovered spot, and that they should become
his sons; as only his thighs were uncovered, he there cut
off their heads with his discus (III, {@203@}).—§ 478: Their
son was {%Dhundhu%}. Description of his penances, and the
boon he obtained from {%Brahmán%}, etc. (see § 476). When
{%Kuvalāśva%}, with his 21,000 sons and his troops, and {%Uttaṅka%}
set out, and aërial voice was heard, the gods showered flowers,
etc., and the gods, {%Gandharvas%}, and great {%ṛṣis%} came to
behold the encounter. At the request of {%Uttaṅka, Viṣṇu%}
filled {%Kuvalāśva%} with his own energy. He let his sons
excavate the sea of sands in seven days, and then they
aroused the {%Dānava%}, assailing him with arrows, etc. He
swallowed the arrows and vomited flames, which consumed
all the sons of {%Kuvalāśva%}, but were extinguished by a stream
of water flowing from the body of {%Kuvalāśva%}, who then
burnt him with the {%Brahmāstra%}, whence he was named
{%Dhundhumāra%} (“slayer of Dhundhu”). The gods and great
{%ṛṣis%} granted him the boon that he should always be able
to give wealth to brahmans, etc. Then the gods and great
{%ṛṣis%} went away to their abodes. {%Kuvalāśva%} had three sons
left—{%Dṛḍhāśva, Kapilāśva%}, and {%Candrāśva%}, from whom
sprang the {%Ikṣvāku%} kings. Blessing upon the reader
(III, {@204@}).
