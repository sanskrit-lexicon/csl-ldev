{@Baka-Śakra-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“Conversation between Baka
and Indra”). § 462 (Mārk.): III, {@193@}: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
having heard that the {%ṛṣis Baka%} and {%Dālbhya%} were long-
lived and friends of {%Indra%}, asked {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} about the
meeting of {%Baka%} and {%Indra. Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: After
the conflict between the gods and {%asuras%} was over, and {%Indra%}
had become the ruler of the three worlds, all people were
happy and virtuous. Once {%Indra%}, riding on {%Airāvata%}, surveyed
his happy subjects, and, descending to earth, he made a visit
to the {%ṛṣi Baka%}, who had lived for 100,000 years and was
adored by gods and {%ṛṣis%} ({%?devarṣigaṇasevita%}, v. 13236;
PCR. has the accus.), in his hermitage in the east by the
seaside. {%Indra%} asked him about the sorrows of those who
have a long life. {%Baka%} mentioned several common disagreeable
things, and finally, the having to witness the injustices that
take place. {%Indra%} then asked him about their joys; he
mentioned the frugal life of a pious {%brahman%}, who only eats
after having waited on his guest.
