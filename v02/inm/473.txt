[{@Amṛtamanthana@}]¦ (“churning of the Amṛta or Am-
brosia”). Cf. Āstīkaparvan. § 28: Once the gods having
assembled on the summit of Mount <is>Meru, Nārāyaṇa</is> told
Brahmán to churn the Ocean with the gods and the <is>Asuras</is>,
in order to obtain Amṛta (I, {@17@}). <is>Viṣṇu</is> and Brahmán
prevailed upon <is>Ananta</is> (i.e. Śeṣa), the prince of Snakes,
to bring up the mountain <is>Mandara</is>. The gods having
obtained from the Ocean the permission to churn it, <is>Indra</is>
placed Mandara on the back of the Tortoise-king; Mandara
was made the churning staff and <is>Vāsuki</is> the cord, the
Asuras holding him by the hood and the gods by the tail,
while Ananta, who sided with Nārāyaṇa, at intervals raised the
snake's hood and suddenly lowered it. Black vapours with
flames issued from Vāsuki's mouth, etc. After some churning
[Page035-a+ 63]
the gums of various trees and herbs mingled with the waters
of the Ocean, and the milky water produced clarified butter,
but even then the Amṛta did not appear. The gods were
tired and repaired to Brahmán, who prevailed upon Nārāyaṇa
to grant the gods new strength to churn afresh. After
a while the <is>Moon, Śrī, Surādevī</is> (wine), <is>Ucchaiḥ-</is>
<is>śravas</is>, and <is>Kaustubha</is> came forth on the side of the
gods; then <is>Dhanvantari</is> with a white vessel of Amṛta
in his hand; then <is>Airāvaṇa</is>, and at last the poison
<is>Kālakūṭa</is>, that <is>Śiva</is>, solicited by Brahmán, swallowed
for the safety of the creation; from that time Śiva is called
<is>Nīlakaṇṭha</is> (‘Blue-neck’). The Asuras preparing to rob
the gods of Śrī and the Amṛta, Nārāyaṇa, assisted by his
{%māyā%} (‘illusion’), assumed a ravishing female form; the
Dānavas and Daityas were infatuated, and placed the Amṛta
in her hands (I, {@18@}). While the Daityas and Dānavas
pursued the gods, Viṣṇu with <is>Nara</is> let the gods drink of
the Amṛta; the Dānava <is>Rāhu</is> also drank of it in the disguise
of a god, but was discovered by <is>Sūrya</is> (i.e. the Sun) and
<is>Soma</is> (i.e. the Moon); then Nārāyaṇa instantly seized his
discus and cut off his head, which to this day swallows Sūrya
and Soma. In a dreadful battle on the shores of the salt-
water sea the gods, headed by Nārāyaṇa with his discus
<is>Sudarśana</is> and Nara with his celestial bow, discomfited the
Asuras, who entered the bowels of the earth or plunged into
the sea of salt waters. The gods replaced Mandara on its
own base, and, headed by Indra, they entrusted the keeping
of the vessel of Amṛta to <is>Kirīṭin</is> (i.e. Nara), (I, {@19@}).
