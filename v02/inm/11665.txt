{@Vāsiṣṭha(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating to Vasiṣṭha”).
§ 11 (Parvas.): I, {@2@}, 387 ({%°am ākhyanaṃ%}).—§ 223 (Caitrar.).
{%Arjuna%} wished to hear about {%Vasiṣṭha%}. The {%Gandharva%} said:
{%Vasiṣṭha%} is {%Brahmán's%} spiritual son and {%Arundhatī's%} husband;
{%Kāma%} and {%Krodha%}, who cannot be vanquished even by the
immortals, used to shampoo his feet. Though his wrath was
excited by {%Viśvāmitra's%} offence, he did not yet exterminate
the {%Kuśikas%}. Afflicted at the loss of his sons, he did not do
any dreadful deed for the destruction of {%Viśvāmitra%}. He did
not transgress {%Kṛtānta%} (Death) in order to bring back his lost
children from the abode of {%Yama%}. It was by obtaining him
that the {%Ikṣvākus%} acquired this earth, and with him as their
{%purohita%}, they performed many great sacrifices. “Therefore
acquire a fit {%purohita%}” (I, {@174@}). {%Arjuna%} wished to hear
of the hostility between {%Viśvāmitra%} and {%Vasiṣṭha%}. The
{%Gandharva%} said: This old ({%purāṇa%}) story of {%Vasiṣṭha%} they
tell in all worlds. In {%Kānyakubja%} king {%Gādhi%}, son of {%Kuśika%},
had a son {%Viśvāmitra%}, who, with his ministers, used to go a
hunting. Once he arrived at the hermitage of {%Vasiṣṭha%},
who offered him {%arghya%}, etc. from his cow {%Nandinī%}, who
yielded everything desired; {%Viśvāmitra%} asked {%Vasiṣṭha%} to
give him {%Nandinī%} for an {%arbuda%} of kine or his kingdom, but in
vain. Then he wanted to take the cow by force. She repaired
to {%Vasiṣṭha%}, who at first did nothing, saying, “I am a
forgiving {%brahman%}”; but at last he said: “I do not abandon
you! Stay if you can!” Hearing this word, the cow attacked
{%Viśvāmitra's%} troops; from her tail she began to rain showers
of burning coals; from her tail she brought forth {%Pahlavas%},
from her udders {%Drāviḍas%} and {%Śakas%}, from her womb
({%yonideśāt) Yavanas%}, from her dung ({%śakṛt) Śabaras%}, from her
urine {%Kāñcis%}, and from her sides {%Śarabhas%} (B. {%Śabarān%} and
{%kāṃścid%} instead of {%Kāñcīn%}), and from the froth of her mouth
{%Pauṇḍras, Kirātas, Yavanas, Siṃhalas, Barbaras, Vaśas%} (B.
{%Khaśān%}), {%Civukas, Pulindas, Cīnas, Hūṇas, Keralas%}, and other
{%Mlecchas%}, who attacked {%Viśvāmitra's%} soldiers. {%Viśvāmitra's%}
troops fied, but none was deprived of life. {%Viśvāmitra%} then,
disgusted with {%kṣatriya%} prowess (“{%brahman%} prowess is true
prowess”), set his mind on asceticism, and finally became a
[Page716-a+ 63]
{%brahman%} and drank {%soma%} with {%Indra%} (I, {@175@}).—§ 224:
{%Kalmāṣapāda%} (q.v.)—§ 225. {%Vasiṣṭha%} patiently bore his
grief, and resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than
exterminate the {%Kauśikas%}. He threw himself down from the
summit of {%Meru%}, entered a huge fire in the forest, and tied a
strong weight to his neck and threw himself into the sea,
but all in vain, and, in distress of heart, he returned to his
hermitage (I, {@176@}). Beholding it bereft of his children, he
left it again and tied himself strongly with cords and flung
himself into a mighty river, but the stream cut those cords
and cast the {%ṛṣi%} ashore, whence that river was called {%Vipāśā%}.
Once more he threw himself into a river flowing from
{%Himavat (Haimavatī%}), but the river immediately fled in 100
different directions, and has since been known by the name
of the {%Śatadru%} ({%“śatadhā vidrutā”%}, v. 6753). He now again
went towards his hermitage, and was on the way addressed
by {%Adṛśyantī%}, the wife of {%Śaktri%}, who had for twelve years
borne his child in her womb. Hearing that child in the
womb reciting the {%Vedas%} with the six {%Aṅgas, Vasiṣṭha%}
refrained from self-destruction, and, accompanied by
{%Adṛśyantī%}, returned to his hermitage. One day he saw
{%Kalmāṣapāda%}, who would devour him; {%Adṛśyantī%} was
terrified, but {%Vasiṣṭha%} restrained him by uttering {%“huṃ”%},
and, sprinkling him with water sanctified by {%mantras%}, and
freed him from his curse that had lasted twelve years.
{%Kalmāṣapāda%} promised never more to insult {%brahmans%}, and
prevailed upon {%Vasiṣṭha%} that he accompanied him to his
capital {%Ayodhyā%} and begat a son for him on the queen.
Then he went back to his hermitage. After twelve years
the queen tore open her womb by a stone, and then was born
the {%rājarṣi Aśmaka%}, who founded the city of {%Paudanya%}
(I, {@177@}).—§ 226: {%Parāśara%} (q.v.).
