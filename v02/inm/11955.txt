§ 530 (cf. Rāmopākhyānap.). {%Jaṭāyu%} (brother of {%Sampāti%}
and son of Aruṇa and friend of Daśaratha) attacked {%Rāvaṇa%},
who cut off his wings. {%Rāvaṇa%} entered {%Laṅkā%} (built by
Viśvakṛt) with {%Sītā. Jaṭāyu%} indicated to {%Rāma (Kākutṣa%})
and {%Lakṣmaṇa%} that {%Rāvaṇa%} had gone towards the south, and
then he died. {%Rāma%} caused his funeral obsequies to be duly
performed. {%Rāma%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa%} killed a {%Rākṣasa%} named
{%Kabandha%}, from whose body there came out a celestial person,
viz. the {%Gandharva%} prince {%Viśvāvasu%}, who had been cursed
by a brahman; he directed them to {%Sugrīva%} (brother of the
monkey king {%Vālin%}), who dwelled at the lake {%Pampā%}, near
the mountain {%Ṛṣyamūka%}, with his four counsellors; then he
disappeared (III, {@279@}).
