[{@Māndhātrupākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (episode relating to Mān-
dhātṛ.) (cf. {%Māndhātuḥ…upākhyānaṃ%}, I, 446).—§ 407
(Tīrthay.): Questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Lomaśa%} said: King
({%rājarṣi%}, v. 10429) {%Yuvanāśva Saudyumni%}, of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race,
performed besides other sacrifices 1,000 horse-sacrifices. As
he had no sons, he made over the duties of the state to his
ministers, and retired to the woods. Having once observed
a fast, he entered the hermitage of {%Bhṛgu%}, while the great
ṛṣis were asleep, and drank a jar of water, which the son of
{%Bhṛgu (maharṣiḥ%}), after having performed severe austerities,
had destined to be drunk by {%Yuvanāśva's%} queen in order
that she should bear him a son, who by his bravery might
send even {%Indra%} to the abode of {%Yama%}. A sacrifice was then
performed for him; after 100 years a son pierced {%Yuvanāśva's%}
left side (nor did {%Yuvanāśva%} die). {%Indra%} came, and put the
boy's forefinger into his mouth, saying “me he shall suck”
({%mām ayaṃ dhāsyati%}, whence the boy was called {%Māndhātṛ%}).
Thereby {%Māndhātṛ%} became very strong, and grew 13 cubits
({%kiṣkūn%}), and acquired the whole of the {%Vedas%} including the
{%Dhanurveda%} by his thought alone, and on the same day he
obtained the bow {%Ājagava%} and a number of shafts made of horn,
and an impenetrable coat of mail. He was placed on the throne
by {%Indra%} himself, and conquered the three worlds in a righteous
way; the gems of their own accord came into his possession,
and he performed a number of sacrifices with abundant
gratuities, and sat at {%Indra's%} side. His sacrificial grounds
({%caityaiḥ%}) were to be found all over the earth, and he is said
to have given away to the Brahmans 10,000 {%padmas%} of kine.
After twelve years' drought he caused rain to come down,
paying no heed to {%Indra%}. He slew the {%Gāndhāra%} king of the
lunar dynasty. Here, in the midst of {%Kurukṣetra%}, is the
spot where he sacrificed to the gods (III, {@126@}).
