[{@Gṛdhra-gomāyu-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the discourse
<div n="lb">between a vulture and a jackal”). § 653{%b%} (Āpaddh.):
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related: The young child of a {%brahman%} died and was
<div n="lb">taken to the burning-place; a vulture caused the lamenting
<div n="lb">kinsmen to leave the child, as the sun was soon to set,
<div n="lb">saying that the child could not be revived by their lingering.
<div n="lb">A jackal, black as a raven, rebuked them for not waiting till
<div n="lb">the sun had set, as the child might possibly revive. The
<div n="lb">vulture and the jackal alternately endeavoured to persuade
<div n="lb">them. The jackal mentioned that by {%Rāma's%} [i.e. {%Dāśarathi's%}]
<div n="lb">slaying the {%Śūdra%} named {%Śambuka,%} a {%brahmaṇa%} child was
<div n="lb">restored to life; similarly the son of R.-ṛ. {%Śveta.%} The vulture
<div n="lb">said that if only {%Rudra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would grant him a boon,
<div n="lb">the child might come back to life, and mentioned the
<div n="lb">spirits and Y. and Rā., etc., who haunt the burning-place,
<div n="lb">while the jackal reminded them that it was here on this
<div n="lb">“quiet and peaceful” spot that the {%Pitṛs%} by thousands took
<div n="lb">leave of the world. The jackal and the vulture continued to
<div n="lb">dispute, exhausted with hunger and thirst, wishing to get
<div n="lb">opportunity of devouring the child. Then {%Śaṅkara%} (i.e. {%Śiva%})
<div n="lb">exhorted by his consort came, and, taking up a quantity of
<div n="lb">water in his hands, restored the child to life for a hundred
<div n="lb">years, and to the jackal and the vulture he granted a boon, in
<div n="lb">consequence of which their hunger was appeased. Blessing
<div n="lb">upon the reader (XII, {@153@}).
