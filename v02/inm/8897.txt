{@[Rājadharmānuśāsanaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the section
containing the teaching of the duties of kings,” the
88th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Rājadharmānu-
śāsana). § 621: After the completion of the water rites
by the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), many {%Brahmarṣis%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), came
to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Nārada%} congratulated {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} upon
his success. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} lamented the loss of his kinsmen
(<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); {%Yudhiṣthira%} at the match of dice had wondered seeing
that {%Karṇa's%} feet resembled the feet of {%Kuntī%}; he inquired
of {%Nārada%}, why the earth had swallowed up the wheels of
{%Karṇa's%} chariot (XII, {@1@}). {%Nārada%} recited to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the
story of {%Kaṛna's%} pupilage with {%Droṇa%} and {%Rāma%} (among G., Rā.,
Y., and D.) and the curse called down upon him by a brahman
whose cow {%Karṇa%} had inadvertently slain (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (XII, {@2@});
then the story of {%Karṇa's%} extraordinary powers of endurance,
in consequence of which his real caste became known to
{%Rāma%} (who had taught him the {%Brāhma%} weapon), who there-
upon cursed him for his deceit; the worm {%Alarka%} was
an Asura named {%Daṃśa%}, who in the {%Kṛta%} age had ravished
the spouse of {%Bhṛgu%} and been cursed by him, until he should be
liberated by {%Paraśu-Rāma. Karṇa%}, arriving before {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}, told him: “I have mastered every weapon” (XII, {@3@}).
{%Nārada%} said: “To a self-choice at {%Rājapura%}, the capital of
the {%Kāliṅga%} king {%Citrāṅgada Duryodhana%} (with {%Karṇa%}),
{%Śiśupāla%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), repaired; the maiden (who was accompanied
by her nurse and a guard of eunuchs) passed by {%Duryodhana%},
who then (relying upon {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}) took her up on
his chariot and abducted her by force. {%Karṇa%}, riding on
his chariot, proceeded in {%Duryodhana's%} rear. The kings
pursued {%Karṇa%} and {%Duryodhana%}; but {%Karṇa%} made them all
turn away, and {%Duryodhana%} reached {%Hāstinapura%} with
the maiden” (XII, {@4@}). {%Nārada%} said: “The {%Māgadha%} king
{%Jarāsandha%} challenged {%Karṇa%} to a single combat; at last they
fought with bare arms, and {%Karṇa%} was about to sever the
two portions of {%Jarāsandha's%} body that had been united
together by {%Jarā%}; then {%Jarāsandha%} gave up all desire of
hostility and gave unto {%Karṇa%} the town {%Mālinī%} (i.e. {%Campā%}).
From that time he ruled over {%Campā%} and the {%Aṅgas%} agreeably
to the wishes of {%Duryodhana%}.” Allusions to XII, {@2, 3@}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>) (XII, {@5@}). D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%} became silent; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
grieved; {%Kuntī%} comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by telling him that
neither she nor {%Sūrya%} could dissuade {%Karṇa%} from fighting
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (XII, {@6@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} lament (<lang n="greek">η</lang>) before
{%Arjuna%}; he wished to renounce the sovereignty (XII, {@7@}).
{%Arjuna%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, justifying war and approving
of the acquisition of wealth, quoting {%Nahuṣa%} (who cried
fie on the state of poverty, in which he had done many
wicked acts, and which is for recluses and {%Ṛ%}.), and citing
the conduct of the gods and Dā., which is sanctioned by the
{%Vedas%}; “this earth formerly belonged to king {%Dilīpa%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">θ</lang>); she now belongs to thee; a great sacrifice awaits thee;
if thou dost not perform this sacrifice, the sins of this kingdom
shall all be thine; those subjects whose king performs
a horse-sacrifice…all become pure,” as shown by the
example of {%Mahādeva (Śiva (b)%}); “this is the great path
called {%Dāśaratha%} (affording place for ten waggons, i.e. the
sacrifice [Nīl.])” (XII, {@8@}). Unmoved by {%Arjuna's%} words,
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} desired to lead the life of a religious recluse
(XII, {@9@}). {%Bhīma's%} address to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} commending
sovereignty (XII, {@10@}).—§ 622: {%Arjuna%} recited the story of
the discourse between {%Śakra%} (in the shape of a golden bird) and
[Page575-b+ 63]
certain youths (Ṛ.) desirous of leading a forest life (XII, {@11@}).
—§ 623: {%Nakula%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, blaming renunci-
ation and commending the life of a householder (XII, {@12@}).
{%Sahadeva%} recommended to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} a life of action with
the soul free from attachments (XII, {@13@}). {%Draupadī%} reminded
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} of his former counsels (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) (XII, {@14@}). {%Arjuna%}
praised him who wields the rod of chastisement; “{%Indra%},
by the slaughter of {%Vṛtra%}, became the great {%Indra%}; those
among the gods that are given to slaughtering others are
adored much more by men; {%Rudra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) are all slaughterers;
all people bend to these gods, but not to {%Brahmán%} or {%Dhātṛ%}
or {%Pūṣan%} at any time, except a few men of noble disposition”
(XII, {@15@}). {%Bhīma's%} second address to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), urging
him to subdue his grief (XII, {@16@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} exposed
the folly of earthly enjoyments quoting {%Janaka%} (observant of
the religion of {%mokṣa%}): “my treasures are immense; yet
I possess nothing; if again the whole of {%Mithilā%} were burnt,
nothing of mine will be burnt” (XII, {@17@}).—§ 624: {%Arjuna%}
recited the story of the discourse between the {%Videha%} king
{%Janaka%} (who had shaved his head) and his queen (the
princess of {%Kośala%}), in which the latter explained the claims of
a life of poverty and renunciation (XII, {@18@}).—§ 625: {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira's%} reply to {%Arjuna%} on the vanity of wealth (XII, {@19@}).
—§ 626: {%Devasthāna%} pointed out to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that the
period had not come when he could retire into the woods
(<lang n="greek">α</lang>) (XII, {@20@}), and recommended the assumption of sovereignty
with his soul freed from attachment, quoting a discourse which
{%Bṛhaspati%} delivered to {%Indra%}; the Ṛ., etc., adopt the religion
of Exertion (not Emancipation), and attain to heaven through
their acts (XII, {@21@}).—§ 627: {%Arjuna%} justified before {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} the slaughter of foes in battle: “{%Indra%}, himself,
though a brahman, became a {%kṣatriya%} in his acts, and battled
with his sinful kinsfolk 810 times” (XII, {@22@}).—§ 628:
{%Vyāsa%} dissuaded {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} from a life of retirement and
commended a life of domesticity, quoting a verse of {%Bṛhaspati%}
(“like a snake devouring mice, the Earth devours a king that
is inclined to peace and a {%brahman%} that is exceedingly attached
to domesticity”), and reciting the story of R.-ṛ. {%Sudyumna%}:
the brothers {%Śaṅkha%} and {%Likhita%} dwelled in two separate
dwellings on the banks of {%Bāhudā%}; once, when {%Śaṅkha%} had
gone out, {%Likhita%} came to his asylum and ate many ripe
fruits. {%Śaṅkha%} told him to confess to the king and ask him
to inflict on him the punishment of a thief. King {%Sudyumna%}
would pardon him; but {%Likhita%} would not; {%Sudyumna%} then
caused his hands to be cut off; {%Likhita%}, having asked pardon
of {%Śaṅkha%}, was told by him to gratify D., Ṛ., and P. at
{%Bāhudā%}, upon which two hands grew out. {%Śaṅkha%} said that
he was not his chastiser, “but the king has been himself
purified, as also thyself, along with P.” That king became
eminent by this act and obtained the highest success (XII,
{@23@}). {%Vyāsa%} exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to grant the wishes of
his brothers, perform sacrifices, and imitate the great monarchs
of old, especially {%Hayagrīva (b%}) (XII, {@24@}).—§ 629: Hearing
the words of {%Vyāsa%} and seeing {%Arjuna%} angry, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
declared to {%Vyāsa%} that earthly rule could give him no
delight. {%Vyāsa%} answered, pointing out the virtues of Time,
quoting “the old story recited by king {%Senajit%} in grief”.
“Engaging in battle has been said to be the sacrifice for
a king; a due observance of the science of chastisement is
his {%yoga%}; and the gift of wealth in sacrifices in the shape of
{%dakṣiṇā%} is his renunciation; all this should be regarded as
acts that sanctify him” (XII, {@25@}).—§ 630: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
reply to {%Arjuna%} recommending a life of {%yoga%} and austerities;
[Page576-a+ 63]
this is the practice of R., regarded by D. as {%brahmans%}; this is
the opinion of the {%Vaikhānasas%}; the {%Ajāḥ%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) have all
gone to heaven by means of {%Vedic%} study; by performing
the acts indicated in the {%Vedas%}, battle, sacrifices, study of the
{%Vedas%}, restrainment of passion, one goes to heaven by the
southern path of the Sun; the northern path is travelled by
those devoted to {%yoga%}, and is much applauded by those
conversant with the {%Purāṇas%}; “one acquires heaven through
contentment,” citing the discourse of {%Yayāti%} of old (XII,
{@26@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} censured himself for his cupidity and
for the slaughter he caused of his kinsmen (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); {%Bhīṣma%} had,
by the energy of his weapons, burnt {%Ugrāyudha%}, etc.; {%Vyāsa%}
comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by explaining the action of Destiny,
and exhorted him to work (XII, {@27@}).—§ 631: {%Vyāsa%} recited
“the old story, that is known by the name of {%Aśman's%}
discourse”: the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka%}, filled with sorrow,
questioned the wise {%brahman Aśman%} as to how a man should
behave upon occasions of the accession and the destruction
of both kinsmen and wealth. {%Aśman%} said that Destiny and
Time are inevitable; “no person can see either heaven or
hell; the scriptures, however, are the eyes of the virtuous;
frame thy conduct according to the scriptures.” {%Janaka%}
became freed from grief; “enjoy the earth, O son of {%Kuntī!%}”
(XII, {@28@}).—§ 632: {%Arjuna%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} (who from his
earliest years was dearer to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} than even {%Arjuna%}
himself) to dispel {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} grief. {%Kṛṣṇa%} asked {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} not to grieve for men who died heroically in battle in
the observance of {%kṣatriya%} duties, quoting the {%Ṣoḍaśarājopā-%}
{%khyāna (b%}), i.e. the old discourse of {%Nārada%} before {%Sṛñjaya%}
when the latter was deeply afflicted with grief on account of
the death of his son. {%Sṛñjaya%} was freed from grief, and
{%Nārada%} gave back to him his son {%Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin%}, whom
{%Parvata%} had given him, and who had been bereft of life; that
child should live 1,000 years (XII, {@29@}).—§ 633: Requested
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa%} told {%Nārada-Parvatopākhyāna (b%})
(XII, {@30@}).—§ 634: Thereafter {%Nārada%} told {%Suvarṇasṭhīvi-%}
{%sambhavopākhyāna (b%}) (XII, {@31@}).—§ 635: {%Vyāsa%} exhorted
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to shake off his grief and assume the reins of
sovereignty. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} feared that the guilt of slaughter
had stained him; {%Vyāsa%} repeated his observations on Destiny
(XII, {@32@}); as {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} still was remorseful (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), {%Vyāsa%}
repeated his observations on Time, and pointed to expiatory
rites, illustrating the case by the war of 32,000 years, by which
the gods, having slain Dai., gained possession of heaven, and
slew 88,000 brahmans called {%Śālāvṛkāḥ%} who had joined the
Dā.; “thou hast only followed the path formerly trodden
by the very gods; men like you never go to hell.” He
recommended a horse-sacrifice as an expiation, mentioning
that {%Indra%}, assisted by the {%Maruts%}, gradually performed
100 sacrifices and became {%Śatakratu%}, and is adored in the
heavens by Aps., Ṛ., and D. (XII, {@33@}). {%Vyāsa%} discoursed
on expiation and indicated the acts for which there should be
expiation, citing the sage {%Uddālaka%}, who caused his son
{%Śvetaketu%} to be begotten by disciple, etc. (XII, {@34@}), and
declared that by penances, religious rites, and gifts one may
wash off sins if one does not commit them anew, and indicated
diverse kinds of expiation for diverse kinds of sins (XII, {@35@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa%} declared what food is clean
and what is unclean (XII, {@36@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} desired to
hear of the duties of kings and of the four different orders.
{%Vyāsa%}, casting his eyes on {%Nārada%}, directed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
apply to {%Bhīṣma%} for discourses on kingly duties, as {%Bhīṣma%},
having gratified D.-ṛ. with Bṛh, at their head, had acquired
[Page576-b+ 63]
a knowledge of the duties of kings, and of that science, with
its interpretations, that {%Uśanas%} and {%Bṛhaspati%} know; and
a knowledge of all the {%Vedas%} with their branches, from
{%Vasiṣṭha%} and {%Cyavana%} of {%Bhṛgu's%} race; in olden days he
studied under {%Sanatkumāra%} (the eldest-born son of {%Brahmán%});
he learned the duties of the {%Yatis%} from {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}; and
obtained all weapons from {%Rāma%} and {%Indra%}; although childless,
yet he has many regions of bliss before himself; B.-ṛ. were
always his courtiers. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was ashamed to approach
{%Bhīṣma. Kṛṣṇa%} exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to rise up, shaking
off his grief (<lang n="greek">β</lang>). Thus addressed by {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} gave up his grief and anxiety, and with his brothers
and the other kings, headed by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, set out for
{%Hāstinapura%}. The procession described (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (XII, {@37@}). The
citizens welcomed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Draupadī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>). {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} entered the palace with {%Dhaumya%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
and was blessed by the {%brahmans%}, but cursed by {%Cārvāka%}, a Rā.
who had disguised himself as a {%brahman%}, and a friend of
{%Duryodhana%}; the {%brahmans%} killed {%Cārvāka%} by uttering the
mere sound {%huṃ%} (XII, {@38@}).—§ 636: {%Kṛṣṇa%} related: In the
{%Kṛta%} age Rā. {%Cārvāka%} performed penances in {%Badarī%}; at last
he solicited from {%Brahmán%} the boon of immunity from fear at
the hands of every being in the universe, which {%Brahmán%}
granted him, only with the limitation that he should be
careful not to offend {%brahmans%}. Then he began to cause
trouble to the gods; {%Brahmán%} predicted {%Cārvāka's%} friendship
with {%Duryodhana%}, and that he would insult the {%brahmans%}
(XII, {@39@}).—§ 637: The ceremony of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
installation on the throne described (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); he made gifts to the
{%brahmans%}, who all blessed him and his brothers (XII, {@40@}).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} answered and enjoined respect for his aged
uncle, disposed of the high appointments of state (<lang n="greek">β</lang>) (XII,
{@41@}), and caused the obsequial rites ({%śrāddha%}) to be performed
in honour of the slaughtered heroes (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), and performed acts of
kindness to the ladies, widowed in the battle, the destitute,
the blind, and helpless (XII, {@42@}). Then he adored {%Kṛṣṇa%}
(XII, {@43@}), and assigned to his brothers proper residences
from among the palaces of the {%Kuru%} princes slain in battle
(<lang n="greek">δ</lang>). They passed a happy night in their respective abodes,
and in the morning presented themselves before king
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (XII, {@44@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} gifts to diverse
persons (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>). Then he addressed {%Kṛṣṇa%} (with the {%Kaustubha%}),
whom he found rapt in meditation (XII, {@45@}); he uttered
a hymn to {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who awoke and praised {%Bhīṣma%} (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>),
asking {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to resort to {%Bhīṣma%} for instruction.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} requested {%Kṛṣṇa%} to grant {%Bhīṣma%} the sight of
his divine person. {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused {%Sātyaki%} to let {%Dāruka%} yoke
his chariot with {%Sugrīva%} and {%Śaibya%}, etc. (XII, {@46@}). Descrip-
tion of the bed of arrows on which {%Bhīṣma%} lay, surrounded by
Ṛ. {%Vyāsa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>). {%Bhīṣma%} hymned {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
moved by {%Bhīṣma's%} adorations, bestowed upon him heavenly
knowledge compassing the Past, the Present, and the Future,
and went away. Those holy brahmans adored {%Bhīṣma%}
and {%Kṛṣṇa%}. Seeing the devotion of {%Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa%}
suddenly rose from his seat and ascended his chariot with
{%Sātyaki; Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Arjuna%} mounted another; {%Bhīmasena%}
and the twins a third; {%Kṛpa, Yuyutsu%}, and {%Sañjaya%} on
their respective chariots (XII, {@47@}).—§ 638: Then {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">α</lang>), proceeded to {%Kurukṣetra%} (description). {%Kṛṣṇa%} pointed
out to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the five lakes of {%Rāma Bhārgava%}.
Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (XII, {@48@}), {%Kṛṣṇa%} related:
{%Rāmopākhyāna (b%}). Then he proceeded quietly in his
chariot (XII, {@49@}).—§ 639: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} eulogy of {%Rāma%} (<lang n="greek">α</lang>).
[Page577-a+ 63]
Beholding from a distance the spot on which {%Bhīṣma%} lay
(on the banks of the river {%Oghavatī%}), {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>),
descended from their chariots and approached and saluted
the Ṛ. (headed by {%Vyāsa%}). Seeing {%Bhīṣma%} on the point of
death, {%Kṛṣṇa%} addressed him kindly (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), and eulogized him
(“competent to subjugate D., G., As., Y., and Rā.; spoken
of by {%brahmans%} as the ninth of the {%Vasus%}; knowing the
knowledge of the {%cāturhotra%}—v. BR.—and the {%Sāṅkhya%}
and {%Yoga%}, etc., the {%Vedas%} and the {%Purāṇas%}”) (XII, {@50@}).
{%Bhīṣma%} saluted {%Kṛṣṇa%} (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), and beheld his eternal form.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} said that it was owing to {%Bhīṣma's%} devotion that he
had displayed his celestial form to him; “those regions,
O king! are ready for thee whence there is no return;
fifty-six days still remain for thee to live; when {%Sūrya%} turns
to his northerly course, you shall go there; D. and V., riding
on their chariots, are waiting for thee invisibly.” {%Kṛṣṇa%} asked
{%Bhīṣma%} to instruct {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc.; “when thou wilt leave
this world for that, all knowledge will expire with thee”
(XII, {@51@}). {%Bhīṣma%} alleged physical weakness and mental
darkness as reasons for his inability to obey {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and he
also hesitated to speak in {%Kṛṣṇa's%} presence. {%Kṛṣṇa%} removed
{%Bhīṣma's%} pain and granted him power to recollect everything
and behold the universe like a fish in a limpid stream. M.-ṛ.
with {%Vyāsa%} adored {%Kṛṣṇa%} with words, accompanied by
{%Ṛc, Yojus%}, and {%Sāman%} verses; celestial flowers fell, and Aps.
sang, etc. At sunset the M.-ṛ., rising up, saluted {%Kṛṣṇa%},
{%Bhīṣma%}, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. Upon this, {%Kṛṣṇa%} (etc.) (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>),
returned to {%Hāstinapura%}, after having saluted {%Bhīṣma%},
saying that they would return next day (description)
(XII, {@52@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} passed the night happily, performed his
morning rites, and was welcomed with music and song at early
dawn; asked by {%Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki%} saw {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and
apprised him of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} readiness to accompany him into the
presence of {%Bhīṣma. Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Arjuna%} to see that
his chariot was made ready; then he, with the twins, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), proceeded to {%Kṛṣṇa's%} abode. {%Kṛṣṇa%}, accompanied by
{%Sātyaki%}, mounted his chariot, yoked with {%Balāhaka%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">η</lang>), urged by {%Dāruka%}. The princes set out. Arrived near
{%Bhīṣma%} (surrounded by M.-ṛ.), {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), alighting
from their chariots, saluted Ṛ. by raising their right hands.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} approached {%Bhīṣma%}, eying him timidly (XII,
{@53@}).—§ 640: Many Ṛ. and Sā., etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), came to {%Bhīṣma%}.
{%Nārada%} urged the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to take advantage of the short
span of life still left to {%Bhīṣma%} for soliciting him to discourse
on morality. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} requested {%Kṛṣṇa%} to put questions
to {%Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma's%} cheerful answer. He enquired of
{%Kṛṣṇa%} why he was desired to discourse on morality and the
duties of kings, {%Kṛṣṇa's%} divine self being best fitted to do so;
{%Kṛṣṇa%} explained that his motive was only the enhancement
of {%Bhīṣma's%} glory; “thou hast always worshipped Ṛ. and
D.” (XII, {@54@}). {%Bhīṣma%} consented to discourse on morality
and duty, and desired {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to question him. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
introduced {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to {%Bhīṣma%}, who comforted {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, saying that what he had done he had done in
observance of {%kṣatriya%} duties. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} humbly
approached {%Bhīṣma%} and touched his feet; {%Bhīṣma%}, kissing
his head, asked him to take a seat and question him without
anxiety (XII, {@55@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} solicited {%Bhīṣma%} to
discourse on kingly duties which are regarded as the root of
all other duties in the world. {%Bhīṣma%}, bowing to {%Dharma%},
{%Kṛṣṇa%} (who is {%Bráhman%} in full), and the {%brahmans%}, set forth
the general duties of kings (“as regards Ṛ. also, truth is
their great wealth”); he quoted two {%ślokas%} of {%Manu%}: “fire
[Page577-b+ 61]
has sprung from water, the {%kṣatriya%} from the {%brahman%}, and
iron from stone; these three can exert their force on every
other thing; but on their origins ({%yoniṣu%}), it is extinguished
({%śāmyati%})”; and two {%ślokas%} of M.-ṛ. {%Uśanas%} (a {%brahman%} who
rushes to battle may be chastised by a {%kṣatriya%}); and
a {%śloka%} of {%Bṛhaspati%} (according to B.) (a king should not
always be mild, nor always fierce) (XII, {@56@}). Continuation
of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse, enjoining readiness for action on
kings; quoting a {%śloka%} sung by {%Uśanas%} (“like a snake
swallowing up mice”; cf. ch. {@23@}); and one by king
{%Marutta%}, agreeably to {%Bṛhaspati's%} opinion; {%Bāhu's%} son, king
{%Sagara%}, who exiled his eldest son {%Asamañjas%}, who used to
drown the children of the citizens in the {%Sarayū%}; Ṛ. {%Uddālaka%}
who cast off his favourite son {%Śvetaketu%}, because the latter
used to invite {%brahmans%} with deceptive promises of entertain-
ment. The king should administer justice like {%Yama%} and
amass wealth like {%Kubera%}. He quoted a verse sung in days
of old by {%Bhārgava%} [i.e. {%Vālmīki%} (cf. Hopkins, p. 61)], in the
narrative called {%Rāmacarita%}, on king[ly duties] (“one should
first select a king; then should he select a wife, and then
earn wealth; if there be no king, what would become of
his wife and acquisitions?” (XII, {@57@}). Continuation of
{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse, inculcating that protection is the very
essence of kingly duties, quoting {%Bṛhaspati%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), and
verses sung by {%Bṛhaspati%} (“by exertion the {%amṛta%} was
obtained, by exertion the {%Asuras%} were slain,” etc.). {%Vyāsa%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), expressed their delight with the discourse. Ṛ. and
the princes left {%Bhīṣma%} for the night and ascended their
chariots; then they bathed in the {%Dṛṣadvatī%}, offered oblations
of water to their ancestors, etc., and entered {%Hāstinapura%}
(XII, {@58@}).—§ 641: The next morning the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
the {%Yādavas%} set out to {%Kurukṣetra%}, approached {%Bhīṣma%}
and saluted the Ṛ.; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired about the origin
of the word {%rājan%} (“king”). {%Bhīṣma's%} answer: In the
{%Kṛta%} age sovereignty first began; the population of the earth
became sinful; the {%Vedas%}, etc., were lost; D. applied to
{%Brahmán%}, who composed a treatise of 100,000 lessons, on
virtue, profit, and pleasure, and emancipation, etc. (description).
{%Brahmán%}, addressing the gods, said that his work, aided by
Chastisement ({%Daṇḍanīti%}), would protect the world. {%Śiva%}
studied the great work and abridged it (then called
{%Vaiśālākṣa%}, in 10,000 lessons) for {%Indra%}, who abridged it
further to 5,000 lessons, and called it {%Bāhudantaka; Bṛhaspati%}
further abridged it to 3,000 lessons, and called it {%Bārhaspatya%};
{%Kāvya%} [i.e. {%Uśanas%}] (the preceptor of {%yoga%}) further abridged
it to 1,000 lessons. Thus, in view of the period of men's
lives and [the general] decrease, that science ({%śāstra%}) was
abridged by M.-ṛ. Asked by the gods, who deserved to have
superiority among men, {%Viṣṇu%} created by his will a son,
{%Virajas%}; but he inclined to renunciation; and so did {%Virajas'%}
son {%Kīrtimat%} and the latter's son {%Kardama. Kardama's%}
son {%Anaṅga%} became a protector of creatures, fully conversant
with the science of chastisement.

<div n="P">Then follows the history of {%Pṛthu Vainya (f%}). Thus the
tales of all past events ({%āgamaś ca Purāṇānāṃ%}), the origin
of M.-ṛ., etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>) were all treated of in this treatise of {%Brahmán%}
({%Paitāmahe śāstre%}) (XII, {@59@}). Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the general duties of the four orders
[Page578-a+ 63]
and the special duties of each of the orders. Sacrifice has
been laid down for the {%śūdra%} also, but without {%svāhā%} and
{%vaṣaṭkāra%} or any other {%mantra%}; he should perform {%pāka-%}
{%yajñas%}, where the {%dakṣiṇā%} is {%pūrṇapātra%} (v. the note of
PCR., p. 195); in days of old a {%śūdra%} of the name of
{%Paijavana%} gave a {%dakṣiṇā%} of 100,000 {%pūrṇapātras%} according
to the ordinance called {%Aindrāgnya%} (B. {%Aindrāgna%}). Devotion
cleanses all sacrifices. The members of the three other
classes have all sprung from the {%brahmans%}; the {%brahmans%} are
the gods of the very gods. The {%śūdra%}, who is without
{%Ṛe, Yajus%}, and {%Sāman%}, has {%Prajāpati%} for his god, and devotion
for his sacrifice. A verse sung in praise of sacrifice by the
{%Vaikhānasa munis%}. The {%homas%} called {%skanna%} and {%askanna%}
(XII, {@60@}). The four modes of life specified (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>). M.-r. cite
a verse sung by {%Nārāyaṇa%} (XII, {@61@}). The four stages of
life have been laid down for the {%brahman%}; the other three
orders do not adopt them. What duties are improper for
a {%brahman%} (XII, {@62@}). Continuation. The duties in the
four stages of life stated more specifically. A {%kṣatriya%}, for
leading the life of Ṛ., may adopt the {%bhikṣu%} mode of life;
[but] a life of mendicancy is not obligatory upon the three
orders (XII, {@63@}). The nature of kingly duties. “It has
been told to you how, in days of old, many kings repaired to
{%Viṣṇu (Nārāyaṇa%}) for the sake of the science of chastise-
ment. S., etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>) are all observant of {%kṣatriya%} duties. In
days of old when Dā. had multiplied, {%Māndhātṛ%} became king
and performed a great sacrifice from desire of beholding
{%Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu%}), who, in the form of {%Indra%}, had a discourse
with him touching {%Viṣṇu%}, extolling the {%kṣatriya%} duties above
all other duties, and citing the example of {%Viṣṇu%} himself,
who for the sake of D. and Ṛ. and {%Brahmán%} and the {%brahmans%},
slew all his foes among the As. (XII, {@64@}). {%Indra%} extolled the
{%kṣatriya%} duties. Asked by {%Māndhātṛ%}, he set forth the
duties of the {%Yavanas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>). Then {%Nārāyaṇa%} (in the
form of {%Indra%}), accompanied by M., repaired to his eternal
abode (XII, {@65@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} dis-
coursed in detail on the four stages of life (XII, {@66@}). What
should be the characteristics of kingdoms. In days of old,
in consequence of anarchy, men met with destruction; they
made certain compacts, but soon repaired to {%Brahmán%} to get
a king; {%Manu%} was prevailed upon to accept the kingdom,
against getting one-fiftieth of their animals, one-tenth
of their grain, one-quarter of their merit, etc. {%Manu%} then
made his round through the world, checking everywhere all
acts of wickedness. Men desiring happiness must choose
a king (XII, {@67@}). Why the king is regarded as a god on
earth. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the discourse between {%Bṛhaspati%}
(the son of {%Aṅgiras%}) and {%Vasumanas%} (king of {%Kośala%});
{%Bṛhaspati%} described the evils of anarchy; the king becomes
{%Agni%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>). {%Vasumanas%} thenceforth began to protect his
subjects (XII, {@68@}). The special duties of a king; the
duties of a king in case of an invasion by a stronger monarch,
quoting {%Bṛhaspati%} (v. 2619) and two verses (v. 2667—8) sung
by {%Aṅgiras%} (i.e. {%Bṛhaspati%}). The blessedness of chastisement;
the king causes the {%Kṛta%} age, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), to set in (XII, {@69@}).
The thirty six virtues that a king should possess. Hearing
the words of {%Bhīṣma%}, king {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, protected by {%Bhīma%},
etc., worshipped {%Bhīṣma%}, and from that time began to rule
according to his teaching (XII, {@70@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhiṣma%} explained the way in which the king should
discharge the duty of protection (XII, {@71@}). The quali-
fications of the king's priest: {%Bhīṣma%} recited the old story
about the discourse between {%Aila's%} son {%Purūravas%} and
[Page578-b+ 63]
{%Mātariśvan%}, explaining the order of birth of the four
classes (from {%Brahmán's%} mouth, arms, thighs, and feet,
respectively) and their duties, the right of dominion apper-
taining to the {%brahman%}; therefore a king should appoint
a priest; D., men, P., G., Us., and Rā. all depend upon
sacrifices for their support, and sacrifices depend upon the
king, who is {%Indra, Yama%}, and {%Dharma%} (XII, {@72@}). The
effects of a disunion between {%brahmans%} and {%kṣatriyas%}:
the old story about the discourse of {%Aila's%} son and {%Kaśyapa%};
the {%brahman%} and the {%kṣatriya%} are said to be the progenitors
of all men; in consequence of the sins perpetrated by sinful
men, the god {%Rudra%} appears in the kingdom. Asked by
{%Aila, Kaśyapa%} explained who {%Rudra%} is and what his acts
are ({%Rudra%} exists in the hearts of men; his shape is like that
of the wind-gods). Then follows a discussion of the following
question: “If chastisement touches the wicked and the good
equally, why should the good yet abstain from acts of
wickedness” (XII, {@73@}). The preservation and growth of
the king rest upon the king's priest: {%Mucukundopākhyāna%} ({%g%}),
the old narrative about the discourse between king {%Mucukunda%}
and king {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (the lord of {%Alakā%}, Kubera) (XII, {@74@}).
The conduct by which a king aggrandises his subjects
and wins regions of felicity hereafter. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} did not
see any merit in sovereignty and wished to retire into the
woods. {%Bhīṣma%} urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to put forth manliness
and exertion (XII, {@75@}). The difference between {%brahmans%}
engaged in their own duties and those amongst them that
are not so engaged (XII, {@76@}). The king is the lord of all
wealth except what belongs to the {%brahmans%}. The old
narrative of the speech made by the {%Kaikeya%} king unto a Rā.,
who was about to abduct him, but at last left him (XII, {@77@}).
Whether a {%brahman%}, in seasons of distress, can practise, as a
means of livelihood, the duties of a {%vaiśya%}; what articles, in
this case, he may sell; how the king should behave when he is
opposed by all the orders of men; if {%kṣatriyas%} become hostile
to {%brahmans%}, how the latter should be protected; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
inquired whether, upon an anarchy happening, any man that
protects and rules acquires merit; {%Bhīṣma%} answered in the
affirmative; a king that does not or cannot protect is useless
(XII, {@78@}). The king of persons that are eligible as royal
priests; the limits or measure of the {%dakṣiṇā%} (XII, {@79@}).
Who should and who should not be trusted by the king
(XII, {@80@}). How the king should conduct himself for
winning over kinsmen and friends: the old story of
a discourse between {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Nārada: Kṛṣṇa%} said: “My
heart is worried through the cruel speeches of my kinsmen;
might resides in {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%}, mildness in {%Gada%}; and as
regards {%Pradyumna%}, he surpasses even myself in beauty of
person; [but] many others of the {%Andhakas%} and the {%Vṛṣṇis%}
are possessed of great prosperity and might. What can be
more painful than [my relation to] {%Ahuka%} and {%Akrūra%}
(v. the note of PCR., p. 260)?” {%Nārada%} said that the calamity
was due to Kṛṣṇa himself; “the kingdom cannot be taken
back from {%Babhru%} and {%Ugrasena%}, employ soft words, etc.;
the {%Yādavas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>) are dependent on thee; Ṛ. always pray
for thy advancement; thou art the lord of all creatures, etc.”
(XII, {@81@}). The second means by which a king may win
kinsmen and friends; an old story is cited of what the sage
({%brahmarṣi) Kālakavṛkṣīya%} had said to the {%Kośala%} king
{%Kṣemadarśin; Kālakavṛkṣīya%} travelled through the country
with a crow in a cage and observed the misdeeds of all the
officers of the king, saying that it was the crow that told
him all this, and related it to the king; the crow then was
[Page579-a+ 63]
found pierced with a shaft within the cage; he quoted {%Yama%}
as to the painful lot of those that serve the king; “this thy
kingdom is like the river {%Sītā%}, boats sink in it; thy father
regarded me lovingly as his friend; when distress overtook
this kingdom during the reign of thy father I performed
many penances.” {%Kṣemadarśin%} then took a minister from
the {%kṣatriya%} order, and appointed {%Kālakavṛkṣīya%} as his
{%purohita%}, and subjugated the whole earth (XII, {@82@}). The
qualifications of legislators, ministers, courtiers, and counsellors
(XII, {@83@}). The merits of agreeableness of speech; the old
account of a conversation between {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Śakra%}
(i.e. Indra) (XII, {@84@}). Which are the affairs of state that
a king has to deal with, and by which persons ought they
to be executed? (XII, {@85@}). The kind of city which a king
should have (XII, {@86@}). How a kingdom should be con-
solidated and how it should be protected (XII, {@87@}). How
a king should behave if he wishes for wealth (XII, {@88@}).
A king should not cut down trees yielding edible fruits.
How one man acquires superiority over the rest; the gifts
made by thee in this world support D., P., men, N., Rā.,
birds, and animals (XII, {@89@}). The duties of kings
({%kṣatradharmān%}) explained by {%Aṅgiras Utathya%} to {%Māndhātṛ%}
{%Yauvanāśva%}, about the king's power being only a trust for
the good of his people and not for the gratification of his
own caprices; the Ṛ. made the king, intending that he
should be the embodiment of righteousness on earth; he is
called {%rājan%} (“king”) in whom righteousness shines ({%rājeta%});
he in whom there is no righteousness is called a {%vṛṣala%}
({%yasminvilīyate dharmaḥ (= vṛṣaḥ)); dharma%} (“righteousness”)
comes ({%sravati%}) from {%dhana%} (“wealth”) or from {%dhāraṇa%}
(“restraining”); {%Svayambhū%} (Brahmán) created {%Dharma%} for
the advancement and growth of creatures; in consequence
of his malice towards the brahmans {%Śrī%} deserted {%Bali%}
{%Vairocana%} and repaired to {%Indra%}, and {%Bali%} indulged in many
vain regrets. The {%śrutis%} declare that Unrighteousness
({%Adharma%}) begat a son named Pride ({%Darpa%}) upon {%Śrī%}; Pride
led many D. and As. to ruin, and many R.-r.; when the king
does not restrain vice, sinful Rā., and persons of neutral sex,
etc., begin to take birth even in respectable families, etc.
(XII, {@90@}). Continuation of {%Utathya's%} discourse. “The ages
{%Kṛta%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), are all dependent on the conduct of the
king. It is said that the Creator ({%Dhātṛ%}) created power for
the object of protecting the weak; weakness is indeed
a great being, for everything depends upon it. The king
is {%Yama%} himself. This is the way in which {%Indra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>)
have acted. D., R., P., and G. sing the praises, both here
and hereafter, of that king whose conduct is righteous.”
Thus addressed by {%Utathya, Māndhātṛ%} did as he was directed,
and became the sole lord of the wide earth (XII, {@91@}). How
a righteous king desirous of acting righteously should behave:
the old story of what M.-ṛ. {%Vāmadeva%} sang in ancient times to
king {%Vasumanas%} (XII, {@92@}); the consequences that result
from the king's acting unrighteously. “{%Yayāti Nāhuṣa%},
thus having propounded the king's lore ({%rājopaniṣadaṃ%}),
said that a king should slay even contemptible foes”
(XII, {@93@}). Continuation of {%Vāmadeva's%} discourse. Thus
addressed by {%Vāmadeva%}, king {%Vasumanas%} did as he was
directed (XII, {@94@}). How a {%kṣatriya%} should act who desires
to subjugate another (XII, {@95@}). A king should never desire
to subjugate the earth by unrighteous means. It was by
such behaviour that {%Indra%} got the sovereignty of the world.
King {%Pratardana%}, subjugating his foes in great battle, took
all their wealth, including their very grain and medicinal
[Page579-b+ 63]
herbs, but left their land untouched. King {%Divodāsa%}, after
subjugating his foes, brought away the very remnants of
their sacrificial fires, their clarified butter, and their food;
for this reason he was deprived of the merit of his conquest.
King {%Nābhāga%} gave away whole kingdoms with their rulers
as sacrificial presents to the {%brahmans%}, excepting the wealth
of learned {%brahmans%} and ascetics (XII, {@96@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
condemnation of {%kṣatriya%} practices. {%Bhīṣma%} pointed out
that by chastening the wicked, protecting the good, performing
sacrifices, etc., a king cleanses himself, and ultimately
obtains a residence in {%Indra's%} heaven (XII, {@97@}). The
regions of felicity acquired by heroes killed in battle: the old
story of the discourse between {%Ambarīṣa%} and {%Indra%}.
{%Ambarīṣa%}, the son of {%Nābhāga%}, having repaired to heaven,
beheld his own generalissimo {%Sudeva%} in the company of
{%Indra%}, and going to regions still higher. {%Indra%} explained to
{%Ambarīṣa%} the sacrifice of battle. “That warrior who,
having slain the commander of the hostile army, mounts
the vehicle of his fallen antagonist, comes to be regarded as
possessed of the powers of {%Viṣṇu%} and the intelligence of
{%Bṛhaspati%}…thousands of Aps. covet him for their lord;
having slain {%Jambha%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>), I myself have become the
chief of the celestials” (XII, {@98@}). The old story of the
battle between {%Pratardana%} and king {%Janaka%}, who cheered
his troops by showing them both heaven (full of G.-girls,
etc.) and hell; his warriors vanquished their foes in battle
(XII, {@99@}). How kings should lead their troops to battle.
“It is proper to set the troops in motion on {%Caitrī%} or
{%Mārgaśīrṣī%}. Keeping {%Saptarṣayaḥ%} (Ursa major) behind
them, the troops should fight; the wind, the sun, and {%Śukra%}
(Venus) should blow and shine from behind them; the wind
is superior to the sun, the sun to {%Śukra%}. When a small
number of troops is to fight with a great many, the array
called {%Sūcīmukha%} should be formed” (XII, {@100@}). How the
troops should be accoutred, armed, and disposed for battle.
The {%Gāndhāras%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>), fight best with their curved knives
({%nakhara%}) and lances. The {%Uśīnaras%} are possessed of great
strength and skilled in all kinds of weapons. The {%Prāvyas%}
are skilled in fighting from the backs of elephants and
conversant with stratagems ({%kūṭayodhinaḥ%}). The {%Yavanas%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>), are well skilled in fighting with bare arms. The
{%Dākṣiṇātyas%} are skilled in fighting sword in hand. Indi-
cations of courage (XII, {@101@}). What the indications are
of the future success of an army. “{%Śambara%} has said that
having afflicted a foe first, forgiveness should be shown
afterwards” (XII, {@102@}). How a king should behave
towards a foe that is mild, towards one that is fierce, and
towards one that has many allies: the old narrative of the
discourse between {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Indra; Bṛhaspati%} recom-
mended conciliation or lulling a foe into security; other
means; a king should never slay a large number of the
defeated troops, etc.; the indications of wicked persons.
{%Indra%}, in subduing his foes, acted strictly according to the
words of {%Bṛhaspati%}, and reduced all his enemies to subjection
(XII, {@103@}). How a righteous king deprived of his kingdom
should act; the discourse between {%Kṣemadarśin%} and
{%Kālakavṛkṣīya%} in days of old, when prince ({%nṛpasutaḥ) Kṣema-%}
{%darśin%} had become weak and fallen into great distress; “only
a fool, deprived of former prosperity, censures the Supreme
Ordainer ({%Dhātṛ%})” (XII, {@104@}). Continuation of the discourse;
“do thou serve the {%Mithilā%} king {%Janaka%}…; cause thy enemy
to perform the great sacrifice called {%viśvajit%} and divest him
by that means of all his possessions, and cause an ascetic
[Page580-a+ 63]
conversant with {%yoga%} to make thy foe desire to adopt re-
nunciation” (XII, {@105@}). The king's reply discountenancing
deceit and fraud. Asked by {%Kālakavṛkṣīya%}, the {%Videha%} king
{%Janaka%} made friends with the {%Kośala%} prince {%Kṣemadarśin%},
took him to {%Mithilā%}, and bestowed upon him his own
daughter, etc. (XII, {@106@}). How the king should behave
towards the aristocracy (XII, {@107@}). Important duties in
brief; the relative superiority of parents and preceptors
(XII, {@108@}). Characteristics of truth and falsehood; “even
a person that is disrespectable…may succeed in earning
great merit as the hunter {%Balāka%} by slaying the blind
[beast]”; {%Kauśika%} again, on the banks of the {%Gaṅgā%}, obtained
great merit ({%sic!%} cf. PCR., p. 352, and Kauśika<sup>6</sup>); a deceitful
person always wishes to betake himself to the practice of
As. (PCR. {%amānavaṃ dharmaṃ%}) (XII, {@109@}). How many
creatures avoid difficulties? “they that worship with devotion
the god {%Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa%}), that Supreme Lord of all
creatures…succeed in overcoming all difficulties. He is
always engaged in doing what is agreeable to {%Arjuna%}, and
also to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}.” Blessing upon the reader (XII, {@110@}).
How may good and wicked men be recognized? the old story
of the discourse between a tiger and a jackal: in ancient
times, in a rich city called {%Purikā%}, there was a cruel king
{%Paurika%}, who was reborn as a jackal; remembering his
former prosperity he became filled with grief and abstained
from meat, and became compassionate and truthful, etc.,
and lived upon fruit that had dropped from the trees; he
dwelt in a vast crematorium, his birth-place. The other
jackals in vain endeavoured to make him eat carrion,
promising to give him food. He consented to become the
minister of a tiger, on the condition that the latter should
always meet with him alone and in secret, etc. The old
servants of the king (i.e. the tiger) first in vain tried to bribe
him; then they secretly placed the meat intended for the
king in the house of the jackal. The king ordered the jackal
to be slain. The mother of the king dissuaded him (“the
firmament seems to be like the solid base of a vessel, the
fire-fly seems to be like the actual spark of fire; in reality,
however, the sky has no base, and there is no fire in the
fire-fly; there is necessity for secreting”). A righteous
agent of the jackal discovered everything about the false
accusation. Notwithstanding the entreaties of the king, the
jackal retired to the forest, gave up his body by sitting in
{%prāya%}, and proceeded to heaven (XII, {@111@}). A king should
not behave after the manner disclosed in the history of
a camel: There was, in the {%Kṛta%} age, a huge camel who
had recollection of all the acts of his former life; he practised
severe austerities in the forest; {%Brahmán%} granted him the
boon that he should have a neck so long that he could seize
any food at even the end of 100 {%yojanas%}. He became idle.
One day a great storm arose. The camel placed his head
and a portion of his neck within the cave of a mountain; it
began to pour in torrents; a jackal with his wife entered
the cave for shelter and began to eat of the camel's neck, and
thus the camel met with his death because of his idleness.
“{%Manu%} has said that victory depends upon intelligence”
(XII, {@112@}). The old story of the discourse between the
Ocean and the Rivers. The Ocean (the refuge of the foes of
the gods) asked the Rivers why the latter never washed
away a cane; {%Gaṅgā%} replied that the reason is that the cane
bends (XII, {@113@}). How a man of worth should behave
when insulted with harsh words in an assembly (XII, {@114@}).
The qualifications of persons that may be employed by the
[Page580-b+ 63]
king. “Criminal laws should be duly administered, even
after the manner of {%Śaṅkha%} and {%Likhita%}” (XII, {@115@}).
{%Bhīṣma%} related the story of the dog who by favour of the
Ṛ. became a {%śarabha%} and was, for misconduct, retransformed
into his own canine form; {%Bhīṣma%} had heard the tale in
the hermitage of {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}, recited by many Ṛ.; the
dog first was transformed into a leopard, then into a tiger
subsisting upon the other animals of the forest (XII, {@116@});
then into an elephant > a lion > a {%śarabha%} (having eight legs
and eyes on the forehead); one day, eagerly thirsting for
blood, he wished to slay the sage, who then retransformed
him into a dog (XII, {@117@}); the dog became very cheerless,
and was driven by Ṛ. from his hermitage. Continuation of
{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on the qualifications of servants (XII,
{@118@}). The lessons to be drawn from the story of the dog
that was transformed into a {%śarabha%} (XII, {@119@}). How a
king should exercise the duty of protection; “the human body
is the residence of {%Indra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>)” (XII, {@120@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed about the origin and
character of chastisement (“the foremost of all beings among
D., Ṛ., P., Y., Rā., Pś., Sā., As., etc.”), quoting {%Manu%} and
{%Brahmán%} (“the first word”: {%prāgvacanaṃ%}); some of the
names of chastisement (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>); “beggars, principal judges,
astrologers, performers of propitiatory and {%Atharvan%} rites,
treasury, allies, grain, etc., constitute the body, composed of
seven attributes and eight limbs, of a kingdom; chastisement
is another powerful limb of a kingdom”; it springs from
{%Brahmán%} (the creator of the universe with D., As., Rā., etc.)
and the {%Veda%}; several kinds of {%vyavahāra; Brahmán%} has laid
down: “neither mother nor father, nor brother, nor wife,
nor priest, is unpunishable with that king who rules agreeably
to his duty” (XII, {@121@}). The discourse between the {%Aṅga%}
king {%Vasuhoma%} (who was pious and, with his spouse, always
practised penances) and {%Indra's%} friend king {%Māndhātṛ%}, at
{%Muñjapṛṣṭha%} (esteemed by P. and D.-ṛ.) on that peak of
{%Himavat%} (near {%Meru%}) ({%yatra Muñjāvaṭe Ramo jaṭāharaṇam%}
{%ādiśat%}; Nīl. is silent) a favourite haunt of {%Rudra%}, where
{%Vasuhoma%} came to be regarded as a D.-r. Asked by {%Māndhātṛ%}
about the origin of chastisement, {%Vasuhoma%} (who knew the
doctrines of {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Uśanas%}) related: Once {%Brahmán%},
desiring to perform a sacrifice, failed to find a priest; he
conceived in his brain; after 1,000 years he sneezed; the
fœtus, {%Kṣupa%}, fell from his head; he became a lord of
creatures and a priest in the sacrifice of {%Brahmán%}. Chastise-
ment disappeared; a great confusion set in; {%Brahmán%}
repaired to {%Viṣṇu%} (armed with an enormous {%śūla%}), who
created his own self into the form of chastisement (having
righteousness for its legs); from that form the goddess
{%Sarasvatī%} created the Science of Chastisement ({%daṇḍanīti%});
after this {%Viṣṇu (śūlavarāyudhaḥ%}) made {%Indra%} the ruler of
D., {%Yama Vaivasvata%} of P., {%Kubera%} of treasures and Rā.,
{%Meru%} of the mountains, the Ocean of the rivers, {%Varuṇa%}
of the waters and As., Death of life and all living things,
Fire of all things possessed of energy, {%Mahādeva%} of R.,
{%Vasiṣṭha%} of the {%brahmans, Jātavedas%} of V., {%Sūrya%} of all
luminous bodies, the Moon of Stars and constellations,
{%Aṃśumat%} of herbs, {%Skanda%} (of twelve arms) of spirits
and ghostly beings; Time of all creatures and the
fourfold death (v. PCR.) and of grief and joy. Upon the
completion of that sacrifice, {%Mahādeva%} made over chastisement
to {%Viṣṇu > Aṅgiras > Indra%} and {%Marīci > Bhṛgu >%} all Ṛ. >
Lp. > {%Kṣupa > Manu Vaivasvata (śrāddhadeva) >%} his sons.
Chastisement remains awake, protecting all creatures, being
[Page581-a+ 63]
in the hands of successive holders: {%Indra > Agni > Varuṇa%}
{%> Prajāpati >%} righteousness > the son of {%Brahmán%}, i.e. Law >
energy > the herbs > the mountains > the juices > {%Nirṛti%} >
the planets and the luminous bodies in heaven > the {%Vedas%}
> the form of {%Viṣṇu%} with equine head > {%Brahmán >%}
{%Mahādeva > Viśvedevāḥ >%} Ṛ. > {%Soma%} > D. > the {%brahmans%} >
the {%kṣatriyas%}. Several names of {%Mahādeva%} (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>). Blessing
upon the reader (XII, {@122@}). {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on Virtue,
Wealth, and Pleasure. The narrative of the discourse in olden
times between Ṛ. {%Kāmanda[ka]%} and king {%Āṅgariṣṭha%} (XII,
{@123@}). How may one acquire a virtuous behaviour? {%Bhīṣma%}
recited the discourse of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to {%Duryodhana%}; as the
latter was burning with envy at the sight of the prosperity
of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brothers at {%Indraprastha%} and his
mistakes in the palace he, accompanied by {%Karṇa%}, went to
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with the same question; “10,000 {%snātakas%} eat
at {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} palace off plates of gold; his steeds are of
the {%Tittiri%} and the {%Kalmāṣa%} breeds (? so PCR.; {%aśvāṃs%}
{%tittiri-kalmāṣān%}), etc.” {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said: “{%Māndhātṛ%}
conquered the whole world in only one night, {%Janamejaya%} in the
course of three, {%Nābhāga%} in seven,” and he related the story of
{%Indra's%} taking away from Dai. {%Prahlāda%} the latter's prosperity;
{%Prahlāda%} in days of yore, by the merit of his behaviour,
snatched from {%Indra%} his sovereignty and reduced the three
worlds to subjection. {%Indra%} repaired for knowledge to
{%Bṛhaspati%}, who caused him to repair to {%Bhārgava%} (Uśanas),
who said that {%Prahlāda%} had better knowledge. {%Indra%}, in the
shape of a {%brahman%}, repaired to {%Prahlāda%}, who said that he
was ever obedient to the teachings of {%Śukra%}, etc. {%Prahlāda%}
granted him a boon, and {%Indra%} wished him to acquire
{%Prahlāda's%} nature ({%śīla). Prahlāda%} was filled with fear, but
granted the boon. A flame of light issued out of his body:
it was the embodiment of his nature, which was going away
and entered the body of {%Indra%}. Then a similar apparition
issued out: it was Righteousness; then Truth; then Good
Deeds; then Might; then Prosperity, that informed him that
the brahman was {%Śakra%}. Asked by {%Duryodhana, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
told him how moral conduct ({%śīla%}) might be acquired (XII, {@124@}).
The characteristics of Hope; “{%Duryodhana%} destroyed the hope
I had cherished,” said {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. The discourse between
R.-ṛ. {%Sumitra%} (of the {%Haihaya%} race) and {%Ṛṣabha. Sumitra%},
when hunting, was led away by a deer that he had pierced
with an arrow; he shot at it again, but in vain (XII, {@125@});
arrived at an asylum he asked Ṛ. about Hope (XII, {@126@});
{%Ṛṣabha%} told him that he had visited {%Badarī%}, the asylum of
{%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}, where the sage {%Aśvaśiras%} reads the
{%Vedas%}; “having performed my ablutions in the lake and
offered oblations of water to P. and D., I entered the
asylum; not far from that spot I entered another retreat,
where I beheld a very tall and emaciated Ṛ., {%Tanu%}, exceedingly
feeble; he began to discourse in the midst of Ṛ.; a king came
with his forces and ladies on a chariot drawn by fleet steeds;
the name of this king was {%Vīradyumna%}; his son and only
child {%Bhūridyumna%} had been missing, and {%Vīradyumna%} came
there in course of his wanderings amidst the forest in pursuit
of the missing one. {%Tanu%} said that a Ṛ. had been insulted
by {%Bhūridyumna%}, who, asked by him for a golden jar and
vegetable barks, contemptuously had refused to gratify the
ascetic, who became disappointed (XII, {@127@}). {%Tanu%} hung
down his head; in former days he had been disappointed by
the king, and he had practised penances for a long time, and
determined to drive away hope from his mind. He then
discoursed about the slenderness of Hope. Then he caused
[Page581-b+ 63]
the lost prince to be brought thither, rebuked the king,
and displayed himself to be the god of righteousness.” Thus
addressed by {%Ṛṣabha%}, king {%Sumitra%} gave up his hope (XII,
{@128@}). {%Bhīṣma%} cited the old narrative of the discourse
between {%Gautama%} and {%Yama. Gautama%} owned a wide retreat
on the {%Pāripātra%} hills; for 60,000 years he underwent ascetic
austerities there. One day Lp. {%Yama (Dharma%}) came and
spoke about truth, etc. (XII, {@129@}). How may a king in
great danger and distress left by his friends behave?
(XII, {@130@}).
