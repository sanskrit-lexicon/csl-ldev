<div n="lb">§ 606 (Karṇap.). The first combat between the gods and the
<div n="lb">{%Asuras%} was about {%Tāraka (Tārakāmayaḥ).%} The {%Daityas%} were
<div n="lb">defeated. Then the three sons of {%Tāraka (Tārakākṣa, Kama-%}
<div n="lb">{%lākṣa,%} and {%Vidyunmālin%}), by practising austerities, obtained
<div n="lb">boons from {%Pitāmaha%} (who refused to give them immunity
<div n="lb">from death): “residing in three cities, we will rove over the
<div n="lb">earth; after 1000 years we will come together, and our three
<div n="lb">cities also will become united into one; that foremost one
<div n="lb">amongst the gods who will, with one shaft, pierce those three
<div n="lb">cities united into one will be the cause of our destruction.”
<div n="lb">The great {%Asura Maya (Viśvakarmāṇam ajaraṃ Daitya-%}
<div n="lb">{%Dānava-pūjitaṃ)%} constructed the three cities: {%Tārakākṣa's%}
<div n="lb">of gold in heaven, {%Kamalākṣa's%} of silver in the welkin, and
<div n="lb">{%Vidyunmālin's%} of iron on the earth; all in such a way as to
<div n="lb">revolve in a circle; each 100 {%yojanas%} in breadth and 100 in
<div n="lb">length (description). Those three {%Daitya%} kings {%(Dānavas)%}
<div n="lb">soon assailed the three worlds, and millions upon millions of
<div n="lb">flesh-eating {%Dānavas,%} who had before been defeated by the
<div n="lb">gods, came to them and settled in the three cities; {%Maya%}
<div n="lb">supplied them with everything by his illusive power.
<div n="lb">{%Tārakākṣa's%} heroic son {%Hari,%} by penances, obtained from
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} a boon: a lake in his city capable of reviving the
<div n="lb">dead when thrown into it. They then exterminated all cities
<div n="lb">and towns, drove the gods from all places, and roamed over
<div n="lb">celestial forests, etc., and the asylums of Ṛ. {%Indra,%} with the
<div n="lb">{%Maruts,%} having tried in vain to pierce the three cities,
<div n="lb">repaired with the gods {%(Ādityas)%} to {%Brahmán,%} complaining of
<div n="lb">the {%Asuras. Brahmán%} said that no one else, save {%Sthāṇu%}
<div n="lb">({%Īśāna, Jiṣṇu,%} i.e. Śiva), could pierce the three cities with
<div n="lb">one shaft. They all, with {%Brahmán%} and Ṛ. (devoted to
<div n="lb">penances and uttering the eternal words of the {%Vedas%}), sought
<div n="lb">{%Bhava%} ({%Śaṅkara,%} i.e. Śiva), who had perfect knowledge of the
<div n="lb">Soul, beholding in him those diverse forms that each had
<div n="lb">individually conceived in his own heart, and praised him (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(VIII, {@33@}). After the fears of P., D., and Ṛ. had been
<div n="lb">dispelled, {%Brahmán%} explained the matter to him. He said
<div n="lb">that they should fight united and with half his energy; as
<div n="lb">they said that they could not bear half his energy, he
[Page682-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">promised to slay the foes endued with half of their united
<div n="lb">energy. From that time {%Śaṅkara%} came to be called {%Mahādeva.%}
<div n="lb">Gathering portions from all forms in the three worlds they
<div n="lb">let {%Viśvakarman%} construct him a chariot; they made {%Viṣṇu%}
<div n="lb">the point, {%Soma%} the head, and {%Agni%} the staff of the arrow;
<div n="lb">Earth the chariot; {%Mandara%} its axle; {%Gaṅgā%} its {%jaṅghā;%} the
<div n="lb">points of the compass its ornaments; the constellations its
<div n="lb">shaft; the {%Kṛta-%}age its yoke; {%Vāsuki%} its {%kūbara; Himavat%}
<div n="lb">and {%Vindhya%} its {%apaskara%} and {%adhiṣṭhāna;%} the {%Udaya%} and
<div n="lb">{%Asta%} mountains its wheels; the Ocean (the abode of the
<div n="lb">{%Dānavas%}) its other axle; the seven Ṛ.'s its {%pariṣkara; Day%}
<div n="lb">and {%Night,%} etc., its {%anukarṣa;%} the planets and the stars its
<div n="lb">wooden fence; {%dharma, artha,%} and {%kāma%} its {%triveṇu;%} the
<div n="lb">herbs and the creepers, etc., its bells; the sun and moon
<div n="lb">were made its [other] wheels; {%Day%} and {%Night%} its wings; the
<div n="lb">ten foremost of Snakes {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} etc., its [other] shaft;
<div n="lb">the sky its [other] yoke; the clouds {%Saṃvartaka%} and {%Balāhaka%}
<div n="lb">the leathern strings of the yoke; the twilight, {%Dhṛti, Medhā,%}
<div n="lb">{%Sthiti, Sannati,%} and the firmament with planets and stars its
<div n="lb">covering-skins; the regents of the world ({%Indra, Varuṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Yama,%} and {%Kubera%}) its steeds; the cardinal and subsidiary
<div n="lb">directions its reins; {%Vaṣaṭkāra%} the goad; {%Gāyatrī%} the string
<div n="lb">attached to the goad; the four auspicious days (v. the note
<div n="lb">of PCR., p. 112) the traces of its steeds; the P. {%(Rohakāḥ)%}
<div n="lb">presiding over them the pins; Action and Truth and Penance
<div n="lb">and Profit its chords; Mind the ground; Speech the track; it
<div n="lb">was resplendent with lightning and {%Indra's%} bow; that space of
<div n="lb">time, which, on a former occasion, had, in the sacrifice of
<div n="lb">{%Īśāna,%} been fixed as a year, the bow; the goddess {%Sāvitrī%}
<div n="lb">the bowstring; a celestial coat of mail was made, sprung
<div n="lb">from the wheel of Time; the golden mountain {%Meru%} was
<div n="lb">made its flagstaff; the clouds with flashes of lightning its
<div n="lb">banners. {%Śankara%} placed upon it his own celestial weapons.
<div n="lb">Making the sky its flagstaff; he placed upon it his bull;
<div n="lb">{%Brahmadaṇḍa, Kāladaṇḍa, Rudradaṇḍa,%} and {%Fever%} became the
<div n="lb">protectors of the sides of the chariot; {%Atharvan%} and {%Aṅgiras%}
<div n="lb">the protectors of the wheels; the {%Ṛgveda,%} the {%Sāmaveda,%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Purāṇas%} stood in front of the chariot; the {%itihāsa%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Yajurveda%} were the protectors of the rear; all sacred
<div n="lb">Speeches and Sciences stood around it, and all hymns and
<div n="lb">{%Vaṣaṭkāra; om%} in the van. Having made the year with the
<div n="lb">six seasons his bow, he made his own shadow (i.e. the Death-
<div n="lb">night, {%Raudrī kālarātrī, Rudra%} being {%Kāla%}) the bowstring;
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu, Agni,%} and {%Soma%} the arrow (v. supra); the universe
<div n="lb">is said to consist of {%Agni%} and {%Soma,%} and similarly to consist
<div n="lb">of {%Viṣṇu,%} who is the soul of {%Bhava. Śaṅkara%} placed on that
<div n="lb">bow his wrath, the unbearable fire of anger, born of the
<div n="lb">wrath of {%Bhṛgu%} and {%Aṅgiras.%} The {%Wind (Śvasana)%} was
<div n="lb">caused to breathe fragrance. The great Ṛ., G., D., Aps. praised
<div n="lb">{%Mahādeva%} when he was about to ascend the chariot. He
<div n="lb">asked to get as his driver him who was superior to himself;
<div n="lb">the gods prevailed upon {%Brahmán%} to become his driver. The
<div n="lb">great Ṛ., G., D., Aps. praised {%Mahādeva%} after he had ascended
<div n="lb">the chariot. His bull uttered tremendous roars, so that
<div n="lb">many descendants and followers of {%Tāraka%} breathed their last.
<div n="lb">Frightful portents appeared. In consequence of the weight
<div n="lb">of {%Soma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), the chariot seemed to sink. Then {%Nārāyaṇa,%}
<div n="lb">issuing out of the point of the arrow, assumed the form of a
<div n="lb">bull and raised the chariot. {%Rudra,%} standing on the head of
<div n="lb">his bull and the back of his steeds, beholding the {%Dānava%}
<div n="lb">city, cut off the teats of the horses and clove the hoofs of the
<div n="lb">bull; from that date the hoof of the bovine species came to
<div n="lb">be cloven and the horses to be without teats. He had united
[Page683-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the {%Pāśupata%} weapon with the shaft. When the three cities
<div n="lb">became united, the D., Si., and great Ṛ. uttered the word
<div n="lb">{%Jaya%} adoring {%Maheśvara.%} When he had shot his arrow the
<div n="lb">cities began to fall down, and burning the {%Asuras,%} he threw
<div n="lb">them into the western ocean. The firs, born of his wrath, he
<div n="lb">quenched, lest it should reduce the three worlds to ashes.
<div n="lb">D., Ṛ., and the three worlds gratified {%Sthāṇu.%}
