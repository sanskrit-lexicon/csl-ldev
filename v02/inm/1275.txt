[{@Bhagavadyānaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
journey of Kṛṣṇa,” the 62nd of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.; cf. Bhagavadyāna). § 562: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} spoke
to {%Kṛṣṇa%} about the mission of {%Sañjaya%} and the wickedness of
{%Duryodhana%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}; though he was supported by
the {%Kāśis%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), he asked for only five villages ({%Avisthala%},
etc., <lang n="greek">β</lang>) or towns, and complained of the cruel duties of the
{%kṣattriya%} order. {%Kṛṣṇa%} said he was willing to go to the
{%Kuru%} court in order to negotiate a peace, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
after some hesitation, agreed to the proposal (V, {@72@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
mentioned the offences of the {%Kauravas%}, and said that he
thought war to be certain; all the omens pointed in that
[Page115-a+ 63]
direction; therefore {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should collect everything
needed for battle (V, {@73@}). {%Bhīma%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to speak
mildly and not threaten the {%Kurus%} with war. “Just as,
when {%Dharma%} became extinct, {%Kali%} was born in the race of
the {%Asuras%}, who flourished with prosperity and blazed with
energy, so was {%Udāvarta%} born among the {%Haihayas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>).
These vile individuals sprang up, at the end of each {%yuga%}, in
their respective races for the destruction of their kinsmen; so
has {%Duryodhana%} been born at the end of the {%yuga%} among us the
{%Kurus. Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Arjuna%} too are averse from war”
(V, {@74@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} scoffed at {%Bhīma%} for his unusual mildness,
though he had sworn, as the sun journeyed around {%Meru%}, to
slay {%Duryodhana%} with his mace (V, {@75@}). {%Bhīma%} mentioned
his well-known valour, and said that he was for bearing their
injuries, only for fear lest the {%Bharata%} race might be extirpated
(V, {@76@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} explained that he had only spoken through
affection (V, {@77@}). {%Arjuna%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to strive sincerely
to bring about peace; for he was able to do whatever he
would; but if {%Kṛṣṇa%} deemed the destruction of the {%Kurus%}
to be preferable, “let it be effected soon”; he mentioned
the offences of {%Duryodhana%} towards themselves and {%Draupadī%}.
At all events, {%Kṛṣṇa%} best knew what was for their good
(V, {@78@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said he would try to bring about what was
beneficial to both the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Kurus%}; to make
peace was within his power; he would do all that could be
done by human exertion, but he could not control destiny;
{%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), would never make peace by giving
up the kingdom; many a time he had tried to withdraw
{%Kṛṣṇa%} from {%Arjuna%}; about a year ago, on the occasion of
attacking {%Virāṭa's%} kine, {%Bhīṣma%} had solicited {%Duryodhana%}
about this very peace (V, {@79@}). {%Nakula%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to
act according to his own opinion, disregarding all he
had heard. Their attachment for the kingdom was now
greater than ever, as nobody could encounter {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>). He should first speak mildly and then threaten
{%Duryodhana%}. He did not doubt that he would accomplish his
object, for {%Vidura%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), would understand him (V, {@80@}).
{%Sahadeva%} said that {%Kṛṣṇa%} ought to provoke a war, because
of the insults to {%Draupadī. Sātyaki%} approved of this, and
thus did all the heroes present (V, {@81@}). {%Kṛṣṇā%} approved of
the words of {%Sahadeva%} and {%Sātyaki%}, mentioned weeping the
injustice of the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, and that they had refused
to give even five villages, {%Avisthala%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), and was of opinion
that there was no necessity for going thither in order to make
peace. {%Kṛṣṇa%} consoled her: “Thou wilt soon see thy
husbands slay their enemies, and crowned by prosperity”
(V, {@82@}). {%Arjuna%} once more besought {%Kṛṣṇa%} to try to
make peace. On the next morning, at the {%Maitra%} hour, in
the month of {%Kaumuda%} (Kārttika), under the constellation
{%Revatī%}, at the season of dews, Autumn having departed
(description), {%Kṛṣṇa%} caused {%Śini's%} grandson {%Sātyaki%} to
prepare his chariot (description); they yoked to it {%Śaibya%},
{%Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa%}, and {%Balāhaka. Garuḍa%} came and
perched on the flagstaff. And taking {%Sātyaki%} also upon it,
he set out under auspicious omens; {%Vasiṣṭha%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>), and
D.-ṛ. and B.-ṛ. ({%devabrahmarṣayaś caiva%}) walked around him
({%pradakṣiṇam avartanta). Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), followed
him on the way, and told him to salute {%Kuntī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>). {%Arjuna%}
said he was for peace, but if {%Duryodhana%} would not give them
what they demanded, he would annihilate the {%Kṣattriya%}
race. {%Bhīma%} uttered a terrible shout, so that the bowmen
trembled in fear, and steeds and elephants were seen to void
urine and fæces. When all the kings had desisted following
[Page115-b+ 63]
him, {%Kṛṣṇa%} set out with {%Dāruka%}. On his way he met with
some {%Ṛṣis%}, and {%Jamadagni's%} son, the friend of {%Brahmán%}
({%Surāsurapāteḥ%}), told him that the D.-ṛ., {%brahmans%}, and R.-ṛ.,
who had witnessed the former feats of gods and {%Asuras%}
({%devāsurasya draṣṭāraḥ purāṇasya%}), had come to see and hear
the assemblage at {%Hāstinapura%} (V, {@83@}). Ten chariot-warriors
followed in {%Kṛṣṇa's%} train, and 100 foot-soldiers and
attendants by hundreds, carrying provisions in abundance.
Sinister omens occurred over {%Hāstinapura%}; but where
{%Kṛṣṇa%} passed everything became auspicious. At {%Vṛkasthala%}
he passed the night (V, {@84@}). Meanwhile {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
having heard from his spies that {%Kṛṣṇa%} was coming, respect-
fully addressed {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>), and said to {%Duryodhana%} and
his counsellors that {%Kṛṣṇa%} (“the lord of all creatures,” etc.)
should be received with the greatest honour; “let pavilions
be set up on the road,” etc. {%Bhīṣma%}, etc., approved of it,
and {%Duryodhana%} made the arrangements. But {%Kṛṣṇa%} did
not even glance at it (V, {@85@}). When {%Kṛṣṇa%} was staying
at {%Vṛkasthala%} and intended to come to {%Hāstinapura%} the next
morning, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} spoke to {%Vidura%} about how he in-
tended to treat {%Kṛṣṇa%} in order to honour him (V, {@86@}).
{%Vidura%} blamed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} for his insincerity; “the right
hospitality to be offered to {%Kṛṣṇa%} is to make peace with the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, and thou wilt not give them even five villages,
and seekest only to separate {%Kṛṣṇa%} from the {%Pāṇḍavas%}”
(V, {@87@}). {%Duryodhana%} said that it was of no use to bestow
wealth and honour upon {%Kṛṣṇa%}, as he could never be separated
from the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, “and he will only think that we are
worshipping him out of fear.” {%Bhīṣma%} advised them to do
as {%Kṛṣṇa%} would say. {%Duryodhana%} declared that he would
imprison {%Kṛṣṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and all his counsellors
became deeply afflicted, especially as {%Kṛṣṇa%} came as an
ambassador. Inflamed with rage, {%Bhīṣma%} rose and left the
place (V, {@88@}). The next morning {%Kṛṣṇa%} rose at daybreak
and arrived in {%Hāstinapura%}, and was solemnly received by all
the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} (except {%Duryodhana%}), etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>), and the
citizens (description). Having saluted {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>),
he went to the abode of {%Vidura%} (V, {@89@}). In the afternoon
he visited {%Kuntī%}, who wept for her sons, comparing {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} to {%Ambarīṣa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>), mentioning the feats of {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena%} (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>), comparing {%Arjuna%} to {%Kārtavīrya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>), and also
inquiring about {%Sahadeva%} and {%Nakula%}, and likewise about
{%Draupadī%} (whom she had not seen for fourteen long years),
mentioning how she was dragged by {%Duḥśāsana%}, while
{%Bāhlika%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>), grieved; but especially she praised {%Vidura%}.
“Full 14 years have gone since {%Duryodhana%} first exiled my
son.” She mentioned the invisible voice on the night of
{%Arjuna's%} birth, and trusted to {%Dharma%} and the Creator and
{%Kṛṣṇa%}. She asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to tell her sons that she besought
them to avenge themselves and {%Draupadī%}, as even death was
better than a life gained by meanness. {%Kṛṣṇa%} consoled her,
and then departed for {%Duryodhana's%} mansion (V, {@90@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
entered {%Duryodhana's%} palace (description), where he also beheld
{%Duḥśāsana, Karṇa%}, and {%Śakuni. Duryodhana%} asked him to
dine at his house; but {%Kṛṣṇa%} did not accept the invitation,
because he hated the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and went to {%Vidura's%} abode,
where {%Droṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">σ</lang>), came to him (V, {@91@}). {%Vidura%} warned
{%Kṛṣṇa%} against {%Duryodhana%}, who would never make peace,
because he trusted {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">τ</lang>), and distrusted {%Kṛṣṇa%}
(V, {@92@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said that he knew {%Duryodhana%}; but great
would be the merit earned by him who liberates the whole
earth from the noose of death; and even if he should meet
failure, the merit of that intended act would become his;
[Page116-a+ 63]
“moreover, I have come here in order that unrighteous,
foolish, and inimical persons shall not afterwards be free to
say that {%Kṛṣṇa%} made no attempt to restrain them from
slaughtering one another, though he was competent to do
so.” Then he laid himself down for sleep (V, {@93@}). In the
morning {%Duryodhana%} and {%Śakūni%} came and invited him to go
to the council where {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Bhīṣma%}, etc., were
present; he rode thither in his chariot with {%Dāruka%}, putting
on his gem {%Kaustubha%}, and being protected by the {%Vṛṣṇis%},
and he was followed by {%Vidura%} in his own chariot, and by
{%Duryodhana%} and {%Śakuni%} in one chariot, and by {%Sātyaki%} and
{%Kṛtavarman%} and the other chariot-warriors of the {%Vṛṣṇi%} race
in chariots and on steeds and elephants (description). Then
he entered the court with {%Vidura%} and {%Sātyaki%}; before him
sat {%Karṇa%} and {%Duryodhana%}, behind him the {%Vṛṣṇis%} with
{%Kṛtavarman. Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, etc., with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} rose
up in his honour, etc. He beheld the {%Ṛṣis%} staying in the
skies with {%Nārada%} at their head, and caused {%Bhīṣma%} to offer
them seats. {%Duḥśāsana%} gave a seat to {%Sātyaki%}, and {%Viviṃśati%}
one to {%Kṛtavarman%} (V, {@94@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} spoke of the just
complaints and claims of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and said that with
them as his allies {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} would become invincible,
having {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>). “Let not the peoples of the earth
be exterminated! If thou regainest thy natural disposition,
the earth may continue to be peopled as now.” All the kings
there present highly applauded the words of {%Kṛṣṇa%} in their
hearts, but none of them ventured to say anything in the
presence of {%Duryodhana%} (V, {@95@}).—§ 563: {%Jāmadagnya%} then
told Dambhodbhavopākhyāna (q.v.). “Great, indeed, was
that feat of old achieved by {%Nara. Nārāyaṇa%} again became
superior to {%Nara%} in consequence of many additional qualities.
Therefore, O king, before such weapons as {%Kākudika%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ϕ</lang>),
are placed on the string of the {%Gāṇḍīva%}, go thou to
{%Dhanañjaya%}, laying aside thy pride!” These weapons have
other names corresponding to the eight passions (lust,
wrath, etc.; description) (V, {@96@}).—§ 564: Mātalīyopā—
khyāna (q.v.).—§ 565: After {%Kaṇva%} had spoken, {%Kṛṣṇa%},
{%Bhīṣma%}, and {%Nārada%} in vain admonished {%Duryodhana. Nārada%}
related the old story Gālavacarita (q.v.), and—§ 566: The
fall of {%Yayāti%} (q.v.).—§ 567: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained that
{%Duryodhana%} never listened to his, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), words, and asked
{%Kṛṣṇa%} to admonish him. {%Kṛṣṇa%} reminded {%Duryodhana%} of
what was agreeable to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), and warned him
against {%Duḥśāsana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>). {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), could not fight
against {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}, who had vanquished D., G., Y.,
As., and Pn. at {%Khāṇḍavaprastha%}; who encountered many at
{%Virāṭa's%} city, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>) (V, {@124@}). {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Vidura%},
and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} recommended {%Duryodhana%} to follow the
counsels of {%Kṛṣṇa%} (V, {@125@}). {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%} warned
{%Duryodhana%} against {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>) (V, {@126@}). {%Duryodhana%}
complained that {%Kṛṣṇa%} always censured him; in the match of
dice blame could not be attached to him. He quoted this saying
of {%Mātaṅga%}, “one should always keep himself erect…”
(V, {@127@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} indignantly answered {%Duryodhana%}, men-
tioning his offences against the {%Pāṇḍavas, Vāraṇāvata%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>).
{%Duḥśāsana%} said to {%Duryodhana%} that the {%Kauravas%} would bind
him, and {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} would make
{%Duryodhana, Karṇa%}, and {%Duḥśāsana%} over to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.
Disregarding {%Vidura%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), {%Duryodhana%} went out of the
court in anger. {%Kṛṣṇa%} blamed them for not having forcibly
seized and bound {%Duryodhana%}; “I think the time has come
for doing this”; he reminded them of how he had himself
slain {%Kaṃsa%}, and then installed {%Ugrasena%} on the throne, for
[Page116-b+ 63]
the benefit of all the {%Yādavas, Andhakas%}, and {%Vṛṣṇis%}; and
that when the gods and {%Asuras%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), were arrayed for
battle {%Parameṣṭhin%} had commanded {%Dharma%} to bind the
{%Daiteyas%} and the {%Dānavas%} and make them over to {%Varuṇa%},
who having bound them with {%Dharma's%} noose and also with
his own, kept them within the depths of the ocean. In the
same way they ought to bind {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>) (V, {@128@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} caused {%Vidura%} to fetch {%Gāndhārī%}, who blamed
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, because he had by his indulgence caused
{%Duryodhana%} now to be the slave of delusion and incapable
of being turned back; she then caused {%Vidura%} to fetch
{%Duryodhana%}, whom she rebuked severely and asked to obey
the words of his well-wishers {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>);
{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Bāhlīka%} [formerly] gave
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} their share from fear of a disunion. If
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>), became enraged the population of the earth
would be exterminated. The affection of {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, and
{%Kṛpa%} towards the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} was equal;
“it is never seen in this world that men acquire wealth by
avarice” (V, {@129@}). Disregarding the words of his mother,
{%Duryodhana%} again went away in anger, and began to consult
with {%Śakuni%}, and {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>), resolved upon seizing
{%Kṛṣṇa%}; then the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with the {%Somakas%} would become
depressed. {%Sātyaki%} knew it, caused {%Kṛtavarman%} to array the
troops at the entrance of the court, and informed {%Kṛṣṇa%},
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and {%Vidura%}, but laughed at the project.
{%Vidura%} told {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that the last hour of all his sons
was at hand. {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that if his sons
perpetrated such a deed {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} object would be
accomplished, “for this very day, seizing them with all who
follow them, I can make them over to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; I will
not, however, commit any such censurable deed that can
proceed only from wrath and a sinful understanding.”
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} once more caused {%Vidura%} to fetch {%Duryodhana%}
with his brothers, etc., and rebuked them; “dost thou not
know {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who is incapable of being defeated in battle by
D., men, G., As., and U.?” {%Vidura%} reminded {%Duryodhana%} that
at the gates of {%Saubha%} the monkey {%Dvivida%} covered {%Kṛṣṇa%}
with a shower of stones, but could not seize him; nor could
{%Naraka%} with all the {%Dānavas%} at {%Prāgjyotiṣa%}; slaying {%Naraka%},
{%Kṛṣṇa%} brought away 1,000 damsels and married them all.
In the city of {%Nirmocana%} 6,000 mighty {%Asuras%} failed to
seize him with their nooses. He also mentioned {%Pūtanā%}
{%Śakunī%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>) (V, {@130@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} reminded {%Duryodhana%}
that he was not alone, and from his body issued myriads of
gods, etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>); all the kings were terrified and closed their
eyes, except {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Vidura, Sañjaya%}, and the {%Ṛṣis%};
for {%Kṛṣṇa%} gave them celestial sight, etc. Then he went
out with {%Sātyaki%} and {%Kṛtavarman%}. The {%Ṛṣis Nārada%},
etc., vanished. He found {%Dāruka%} waiting with his chariot
(description) drawn by {%Śaibya%}, and {%Kṛtavarman%}, who had
mounted his chariot. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} excused himself, saying
that he was powerless. {%Kṛṣṇa%} bade farewell to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>), and set out, followed by {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ρ</lang>), to the
abode of {%Kuntī%} (V, {@131@}). {%Kuntī%} asked him to admonish
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to attend to the duties of his own order, and not
contemplate virtue alone (“thy virtue is decreasing greatly”),
citing {%Mucukunda (b%}). It is the king that creates the {%Kṛta%},
{%Tretā%}, or {%Dvāpara%} age; if he creates the {%Kṛta%} age, he enjoys
heaven exceedingly; if he creates the {%Tretā%}, he enjoys
heaven, but not exceedingly; if he causes the {%Dvāpara%} age
to set in, he enjoys heaven according to his due; if he
promotes the {%Kali%} age, he will reside in hell for countless
[Page117-a+ 63]
years. “That understanding according to which thou art
now acting, is not in accordance with the intentions of
{%Pāṇḍu%}, or myself, or thy grandsire, when we uttered blessings
on thee before,” etc. (V, {@132@}). “In this connection is cited
an old story: § 568. Vidulāputraśāsana” (q.v.).—§ 569:
{%Kuntī%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to remind {%Arjuna%} of the voice heard at
his birth (that he should rival {%Indra%}, vanquish the {%Kurus%},
conquer the earth aided by {%Bhīma%}; slay the {%Kurus%} in battle
with {%Kṛṣṇa%} as his ally, and recover his share in the
kingdom, and, with his brothers, perform three great sacri-
fices); to {%Bhīma%} he should say that “the time has come
for that in view of which a {%kṣattriya%} lady brings forth
a son”; {%Kṛṣṇā%} he should praise for her behaviour towards
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; he should remind {%Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%}, that
they must not forgive the insults towards {%Draupadī%}, that was
worse than the defeat at dice and the exile; {%Arjuna%} should
always tread in the path pointed out by {%Draupadī; Bhīma%}
and {%Arjuna%} are a pair of {%Yamas%} capable of slaying the very
gods; they should revenge the harsh words said by {%Duḥśāsana%}
to {%Bhīma. Kṛṣṇa%} bade farewell to {%Bhīṣma%}, etc., took
{%Karṇa%} upon his chariot and set out with {%Sātyaki%}, deliberating
with {%Karṇa%} for a long time. Then he dismissed {%Karṇa%}, and
driven by {%Dāruka%} the steeds soon reached {%Upaplavya%}. The
{%Kurus%} assembled and talked about {%Kṛṣṇa%} (V, {@137@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
and {%Droṇa%} reminded {%Duryodhana%} of what {%Kuntī%} had said to
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, and the exploits of {%Arjuna%}; they recommended
peace; fearful omens appeared (V, {@138@}). {%Duryodhana%} was
cheerless and silent. {%Bhīṣma%} complained. {%Droṇa%} said that
his affection for {%Arjuna%} was greater than for {%Aśvatthāman%};
{%Duryodhana%} ought to have followed the counsels of the
elders; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was invincible; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had
procured wealth from {%Kubera's%} abode; “the periods of our
lives have run out”; etc. (V, {@139@}). Requested by
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} related the conversation between
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Karṇa%} (see the note of PCR.). {%Kṛṣṇa%} disclosed
to {%Karṇa%} that he was virtually the son of {%Pāṇḍu%}, and on the
side of his father was related to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, on the side of
his mother to the {%Vṛṣṇis%}. He ought to come with him to
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, being the elder brother of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and be
installed as king by {%Dhaumya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} being
his heir-presumptive and ruling the kingdom under him;
“during the sixth period {%Draupadī%} also will come to thee”;
“let the {%Draviḍas%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), walk before thee” (V, {@140@}).
{%Karṇa%} admitted that he was virtually the son of {%Pāṇḍu%},
{%Kuntī%} having, while a maiden, born him to {%Sūrya%} and then
abandoned him. But the {%Sūta Adhiratha%} had taken him to
his home; from her affection for him {%Rādhā's%} breasts were
filled with milk that very day, and she held his urine and
fæces; “how can one like us….deprive her
of her {%piṇḍa?%}” {%Adhiratha%} regarded {%Karṇa%} as a son, and
{%Karṇa%} regarded {%Adhiratha%} as a father; he had caused all the
rites of infancy to be performed on {%Karṇa%} according to the
scriptures; he had caused the name {%Vasuṣeṇa%} to be bestowed
upon him by the {%brahmans%}; when {%Karṇa%} attained to youth he
married wives according to {%Adhiratha's%} selection; with them
he had begotten sons and grandsons. Through {%Duryodhana%}
he had enjoyed sovereignty for thirteen years. His many sacri-
fices had always been with {%Sūtas%}, as had also his family rites
and marriage rites. It was only after having got hold of
{%Karṇa%} that {%Duryodhana%} had decided upon war with the
{%Pāṇḍavas, Karṇa%} having been chosen as the antagonist of
{%Arjuna%}. Their discourse ought to be kept secret, lest {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} should refuse to accept the kingdom; and “if the empire
[Page117-b+ 63]
becomes mine I shall certainly make it over to {%Duryodhana%}
only.” He praised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), and the weapons of
{%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>), comparing the combat to a sacrifice; and {%Bhīma's%}
drinking the blood of {%Duḥśāsana%} to the {%Soma%}-drinking, etc.
(V, {@141@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} said the victory of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} was very
certain; he described {%Arjuna's%} banner, made by {%Bhaumana%} by
celestial illusion; his {%Aindra, Āgneya%}, and {%Māruta%} weapons,
etc.; “then all signs of the {%Kṛta, Tretā%}, and {%Dvāpara%} ages
will disappear.” He forebade {%Bhīmasena's%} dancing, having
quaffed the blood of {%Duḥśāsana%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>). “Returning hence,
say to {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>), that the present month is a
delightful one; 7 days hence it will be the day of the new
moon, presided over by {%Indra%}; let the battle commence then”
(V, {@142@}). {%Karṇa%} ascribed the approaching destruction to
{%Śakuni%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>), and mentioned diverse sinister visions of
planets (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>), etc., and he had seen in a vision, foreboding
victory, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>), and the inverse respecting
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>). “{%Karṇa%} embraced {%Kṛṣṇa%}, descended
from his chariot, and riding in his own chariot, which was
decked with gold, came back with us” (V, {@143@}). {%Vidura%}
approached {%Kuntī%} and spoke of the state and disposition of
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>), and the allies of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>).
{%Kuntī%} thought with grief on those who were going to
fight (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>). Especially she was afraid of {%Karṇa%}; she
recollected the boon of {%Durvāsas%} and its consequences (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>).
She went to {%Karṇa%}, who was standing performing his
prayers on the bank of {%Gaṅgā%} with his face turned towards
the east and his arms upraised; and she stayed behind him,
waiting for the completion of his prayers. Then, turning
round, he beheld {%Kuntī%} (V, {@144@}). {%Kuntī%} disclosed to {%Karṇa%}
his birth, mentioned the justice of the {%Pāṇḍava%} cause and
the injustice of {%Duryodhana's%}, and besought him to join the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} (V, {@145@}). {%Sūrya%} corroborated the words of {%Kuntī%}.
But {%Karṇa%} represented to her the great injury she had done
him; he could not now frustrate the hope of the {%Kauravas%};
but “except {%Arjuna%} thy other sons shall not be slain by me.”
They then left the spot, turning into different directions
(V, {@146@}). At {%Upaplavya Kṛṣṇa%} represented to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
all that had happened at {%Hāstinapura%}. In the night, {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} again brought {%Kṛṣṇa%} into their midst, and caused him
to repeat what had been said by {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>); {%Bhīṣma%}
had related his own life (<lang n="greek">π</lang>); he mentioned a duel with
{%Rāma [Jāmadagnya]%}, where {%Vicitravīrya%} fled, having
been deserted by his subjects; upon {%Vicitravīrya's%} death
anarchy prevailed in the kingdom, and {%Indra%} did not give
a drop of rain; afflicted by hunger and maladies (very few
of them were still alive), the subjects then asked {%Bhīṣma%}
—in vain—to ascend the throne; “when {%Pāṇḍu%} became king,
his sons must obtain their paternal inheritance” (V, {@147@}).
{%Droṇa%} had related the life of {%Pāṇḍu. Vidura%} had asked
{%Bhīṣma%} to go to the woods with him and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, or
to bind {%Duryodhana%} and rule the kingdom with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.
{%Gāndhārī%} proved that the kingdom by right belonged to the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and their sons and grandsons, and to no others
(V, {@148@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had repeated to {%Duryodhana%} the
genealogy of the {%Kuru%} race from {%Soma%}, mentioning especially
that {%Yayāti (b%}) had placed his youngest son {%Pūru%} on the
throne; and that {%Devāpi's%} installation was forbidden by the
{%brahmans%} and all aged persons because of a skin disease
(leprosy, Nīl.), and as {%Bāhlika%} abandoned his father and
brother and obtained the wealthy kingdom of his maternal
uncle, {%Śāntanu%}, the youngest of the three brothers, became
king. “Being defective of a limb, I was likewise excluded
[Page118-a+ 63]
by {%Pāṇḍu%}; at his death the kingdom must pass to his sons
…thou art not the son of a king, and therefore hast
no right to the kingdom” (V, {@149@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} continued his
relation; {%Duryodhana%} had repeatedly instructed the kings,
saying: “To-day is {%Puṣya%} [in conjunction with the moon];
march ye.” “Eleven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} have been assembled headed
by {%Bhīṣma%} (with the device of the palmyra in his banner)”
(V, {@150@}).
