{@Bhīṣmotpatti(ḥ)@}¦ (“origin of Bhīṣma”). § 163 (cf.
{%Śāntanūp%}.): {%Gaṅgā%} agreed to become the wife of {%Śāntanu%}
on the condition that she would leave him the moment he
interfered with her or spoke an unkind word to her. They
had eight children; but seven of them were, as soon as
they were born, thrown into the water by her. The eighth
was rescued by {%Śāntanu's%} interfering. But then {%Gaṅgā%},
telling him who she was, and that his sons were the eight
{%Vasu's%} who had been cursed by {%Vasiṣṭha%}, left him (I, 98).
