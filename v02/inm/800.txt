§ 394 (Tīrthay.): III, {@115@}: The Haihaya king Arjuna had
1,000 arms, and, by the favour of Dattātreya, he had obtained

Arjuna affronted Indra, when he was sporting with Śaśī.
After having held a consultation with Indra, Viṣṇu went to
his hermitage Badarī (for continuation v. Jamadagni), 10135
({%Haihayādhipatiḥ%}), 10140.—§ 397 (Jamadagni): III, {@116@}:
Once, when the sons of Jamadagni had gone out, Arjuna
Kārtavīrya, the lord of the country near the sea-shore
({%Anūpapatiḥ%}), came to the hermitage, and, being received
hospitably by Reṇukā (the wife of Jamadagni), carried off
the calf of the {%homadhenu%} and pulled down the trees. As
Jamadagni told Rāma this, Rāma rushed towards Arjuna,
and cut down his 1,000 arms with his arrows, and killed him.
The heirs of Arjuna came while Rāma was away, and shot
Jamadagni to death with their arrows. When they had gone
away Rāma returned to the hermitage (III, {@116@}), 10195.—
§ 398 (Paruśa-Rāma): III, {@117@}: After having lamented for
and cremated his father, Rāma vowed the slaughter of the
entire kṣattriya caste, killed Kārtavīrya's sons, etc.—§ 638{%b%}
(Rāmop.): XII, {@49@}: Meanwhile the virtuous kṣattriya,
the Haihaya king Arjuna Kārtavīrya, with 1,000 arms
through the grace of Dattātreya, having subjugated the
whole earth with its mountains and seven islands, became
a powerful emperor, and gave away the earth to the brahmans
in a horse-sacrifice. Solicited by Agni, he once gave alms
to that deity, who sprung from the point of his shaft,
i.e. Agni burnt villages, etc., and he burnt also the retreat of
Āpava (= Vasiṣṭha), who cursed Arjuna, saying that Rāma
should lop off his arms. Always devoted to peace, always
regardful of brahmans, etc., Arjuna did not mind that
curse. His sons, always haughty and cruel, seized and
brought away the calf of Jamadagni's {%homa-%}cow, without the
knowledge of Arjuna. Rāma lopped off the arms of Arjuna
and brought back the calf; the sons of Arjuna came and
slew Jamadagni in the absence of Rāma, who vowed to free
the earth of kṣattriyas, and slaughtered all the sons and
grandsons of Arjuna, and 1,000 Haihayas, and freed the
earth of all kṣattriyas, etc., 1750 ({%Kṛtavīryātmajo, Haiha-%}

Arjuna Kārtavīrya with 1,000 arms became the lord of this
whole world (i.e. the earth), residing in Māhiṣmatī; he gave
large gifts to Dattātreya, who granted him four boons: that
he should have 1,000 arms in battle, but only two at home;
that he should subjugate the whole earth righteously; and
reign with vigilance; and that whenever he might happen
to go wrong, the righteous should set him right. {%A%}. now
regarded himself as having no equal. An invisible voice said
that the brahman is superior to the kṣattriya; {%A%}. maintained
that the brahmans take refuge with the kṣattriyas; “I shall
bring the skin-clad brahmans under my sway.” Vāyu (Wind)
warned {%A.%}, addressing him from the air, etc. At last Arjuna
praised the brahmans, mentioning Dattātreya. Vāyu told
him always to protect them; “a terrible danger threatens
thee from the Bhṛgus; that will take place after a time,”

1,000 armed king Kārtavīryārjuna conquered the whole earth
with his bow; once he showered hundreds of arrows at the
ocean. The ocean asked him to desist, as he injured the
creatures in the waters; Arjuna asked if there existed any
bowman who was his equal in shooting. The Ocean named
Rāma Jāmadagnya. Arjuna came and began to trouble him;
Rāma burnt his troops and prostrated him with his battle-
