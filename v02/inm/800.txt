<div n="lb">hospitably by Reṇukā (the wife of Jamadagni), carried off
<div n="lb">the calf of the {%homadhenu%} and pulled down the trees. As
<div n="lb">Jamadagni told Rāma this, Rāma rushed towards Arjuna,
<div n="lb">and cut down his 1,000 arms with his arrows, and killed him.
<div n="lb">The heirs of Arjuna came while Rāma was away, and shot
<div n="lb">Jamadagni to death with their arrows. When they had gone

<div n="lb">to that deity, who sprung from the point of his shaft,
<div n="lb">i.e. Agni burnt villages, etc., and he burnt also the retreat of
<div n="lb">Āpava (= Vasiṣṭha), who cursed Arjuna, saying that Rāma
<div n="lb">should lop off his arms. Always devoted to peace, always
<div n="lb">regardful of brahmans, etc., Arjuna did not mind that
<div n="lb">curse. His sons, always haughty and cruel, seized and
<div n="lb">brought away the calf of Jamadagni's {%homa-%}cow, without the
<div n="lb">knowledge of Arjuna. Rāma lopped off the arms of Arjuna
<div n="lb">and brought back the calf; the sons of Arjuna came and

<div n="lb">he should have 1,000 arms in battle, but only two at home;
<div n="lb">that he should subjugate the whole earth righteously; and
<div n="lb">reign with vigilance; and that whenever he might happen
