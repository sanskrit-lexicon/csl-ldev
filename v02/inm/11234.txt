<div n="lb">—§ 772{%j%} (Pavanārjunasaṃv.): {%Vāyu%} said: The beautiful

<div n="lb">become the wife of the brahman {%U.%} of {%Aṅgiras'%} race; and she
<div n="lb">underwent severe austerities for this purpose. Then {%Atri%}
<div n="lb">[the father of {%Soma%}] invited {%U.%} and gave her to him. {%Varuṇa%}
<div n="lb">had coveted the girl from former times; he came to the

<div n="lb">with 600,000 lakes (read {%°śata°%} with B.) with palaces and

<div n="lb">caused him to request {%Varuṇa%} to restore her (“thou art
<div n="lb">a {%Lokapāla,%} not a destroyer of the world”). As {%Varuṇa%}
<div n="lb">refused, and {%Nārada%} related to {%U.%} that {%Varuṇa%} had seized
<div n="lb">him by the throat and driven him from his house, {%U.%}
<div n="lb">{%(Aṅgiras)%} stopped the waters and drank them off, and caused.
<div n="lb">the earth to dry up the 600,000 lakes, and the {%Sarasvatī%} to
