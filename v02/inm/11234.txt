—§ 772{%j%} (Pavanārjunasaṃv.): {%Vāyu%} said: The beautiful
{%Bhadrā%}, the daughter of {%Soma%}, was destined by her father to
become the wife of the brahman {%U%}. of {%Aṅgiras'%} race; and she
underwent severe austerities for this purpose. Then {%Atri%}
[the father of {%Soma%}] invited {%U%}. and gave her to him. {%Varuṇa%}
had coveted the girl from former times; he came to the
forest and stole her away, when she bathed in the
{%Yamunā%}, and carried her to his wonderful city, adorned
with 600,000 lakes (read {%°śata°%} with B.) with palaces and
{%Apsarases%}, etc. Having heard all this from {%Nārada, U%}.
caused him to request {%Varuṇa%} to restore her (“thou art
a {%Lokapāla%}, not a destroyer of the world”). As {%Varuṇa%}
refused, and {%Nārada%} related to {%U%}. that {%Varuṇa%} had seized
him by the throat and driven him from his house, {%U%}.
({%Aṅgiras%}) stopped the waters and drank them off, and caused.
the earth to dry up the 600,000 lakes, and the {%Sarasvatī%} to
become invisible, and the region to cease to be sacred.
Then {%Varuṇa%} restored {%Bhadrā%} to {%U.%}, who then freed the
world and {%Varuṇa%} from distress. “Name thou a kṣatriya
who is superior to {%U%}.” (XIII, {@155@}): XIII, {@155@}, 7240
