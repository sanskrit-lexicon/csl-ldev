<div n="lb">(description of a {%cāndra vrata%} or religious performance with
<div n="lb">reference to the moon in the month Mārgaśīrṣa, when the
<div n="lb">moon is in conjunction with the asterism Mūla; the explana-
<div n="lb">tion of Nīlakaṇtha runs thus:—Here is described a {%cāndra%}
<div n="lb">{%vrata%} to obtain a desired object; on the 1st day of the bright
<div n="lb">half of Mārgaśīrṣa, when there is conjunction (of the moon)
<div n="lb">with the nakṣatra Mūla, one should begin this {%cāndra vrata;%}
<div n="lb">it consists in locating the nakṣatras in the limbs of the
<div n="lb">moon, Mūla in his feet, etc., i.e., one should think of Mūla
<div n="lb">together with its deity as being the feet of the moon; in
<div n="lb">like manner Rohiṇī, etc., with their deities are to be thought
<div n="lb">of as being his legs, etc.; everywhere the exchanging of the
<div n="lb">case-endings is a Vedic liberty; Āṣāḍhā, Phālgunī, and
<div n="lb">Bhādrapadā represent each 2 nakṣatras. The {%vrata%} is
<div n="lb">performed as follows: after one has had pronounced the
<div n="lb">wish of a lucky day, etc. {%(puṇyāhavācanādipūrvakaṃ),%}
<div n="lb">having taken upon one's self a religious exercise to obtain
<div n="lb">a desired object, one should fancy the moon and one's self
<div n="lb">to be one and the same, distribute the nakṣatras together
[Page005-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">with their respective deities in the limbs of the moon, and
<div n="lb">day after day propitiate them by the muttering of Veda
<div n="lb">verses and oblations, etc. {%(japahomādinā),%} with the Veda verses
<div n="lb">required for each of them {%(tattanmantraiḥ);%} thus one should
<div n="lb">go on until the day of the full moon, and when the {%vrata%}
<div n="lb">is at an end, one should present the butter {%(ghṛta)%} left from
<div n="lb">the oblations to the teacher {%(ācārya);%} by the words {%“samāpte%}
<div n="lb">{%tu ghṛtaṃ dadyāt”%} it is indicated that ghṛta is the substance
<div n="lb">of the oblation. Thus doing even a cripple becomes well-
<div n="lb">shaped {%(sakalāṅgo)%} at the day of the full moon; this is
<div n="lb">expressed and exemplified by the sentence beginning with
<div n="lb">{%“paripūrṇāṅga.”%} Aśleṣāḥ (C. Ă°, B. Ā°) is to be identified
<div n="lb">with the nails). (The chapter is in C. called Aṅgavidhi, in B.
<div n="lb">Dānadharma.)
