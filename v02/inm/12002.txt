[{@Vidurāgamanaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“on the arrival of
Vidura”, the 14th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
(Cf. Vidurāgamana). § 241. The news had been reported
to all the monarchs that {%Draupadī%} had been married to
the sons of {%Pāṇḍu%}, whom they had thought burnt to death.
They then set out for their own dominions. {%Duryodhana%}
became greatly depressed, and, with his brothers, etc., he set
out for {%Hāstinapura. Vidura%} was filled with joy, and related
the news to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who first thought that it was
{%Duryodhana%} who had been selected by {%Draupadī%}, but was
very glad on hearing that it was the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. But {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} and {%Karṇa%} tried to stir him up against them (I, {@200@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said that he was of their opinion, but did not
wish to inform {%Vidura%} of it; therefore he had applauded
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in {%Vidura's%} presence. {%Duryodhana%} suggested
several plans for getting the better of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (I, {@201@}).
{%Karṇa%} said that the plans would not succeed; he recom-
mended to vanquish them by prowess, while their party was
yet weak. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} summoned {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, and
{%Vidura%}, and consulted with them (I, {@202@}). {%Bhīṣma%} recom-
mended to give to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} one half of the kingdom
(I, {@203@}). {%Droṇa%} approved of this, and, moreover, recom-
mended that a messenger should be sent to {%Drupada%} with
gifts, and say that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was very glad of the new
alliance with him, and would take the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to {%Hāstinapura%}
to be installed on the throne.—§ 242. {%Karṇa%} spoke con-
temptuously of {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}, saying that happiness
depended on destiny, and not on friends, etc., mentioning the
{%Magadha%} king {%Ambuvīca (b%}) (I, {@204@}).—§ 243. {%Vidura%}
recommended the suggestion of {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}, and said
that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were invincible, as they were assisted by
{%Rāma, Janārdana, Sātyaki%}, etc. (I, {@205@}). {%Vidura%} was sent
by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with numerous jewels, etc., to {%Drupada%} and
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (also {%Kṛṣṇa%} was present). {%Vidura%} said that
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was highly pleased with the alliance with
{%Drupada%}, and asked {%Drupada%} to permit the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, with
their mother and wife, to return to their paternal city
(I, {@206@}).
