[{@Vidurāgamanaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“on the arrival of
<div n="lb">Vidura”, the 14th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
<div n="lb">(Cf. Vidurāgamana). § 241. The news had been reported
<div n="lb">to all the monarchs that {%Draupadī%} had been married to
<div n="lb">the sons of {%Pāṇḍu,%} whom they had thought burnt to death.
<div n="lb">They then set out for their own dominions. {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">became greatly depressed, and, with his brothers, etc., he set
<div n="lb">out for {%Hāstinapura. Vidura%} was filled with joy, and related
<div n="lb">the news to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} who first thought that it was
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} who had been selected by {%Draupadī,%} but was
<div n="lb">very glad on hearing that it was the {%Pāṇḍavas.%} But {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} and {%Karṇa%} tried to stir him up against them (I, {@200@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said that he was of their opinion, but did not
<div n="lb">wish to inform {%Vidura%} of it; therefore he had applauded
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in {%Vidura's%} presence. {%Duryodhana%} suggested
<div n="lb">several plans for getting the better of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (I, {@201@}).
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} said that the plans would not succeed; he recom-
<div n="lb">mended to vanquish them by prowess, while their party was
<div n="lb">yet weak. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} summoned {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Vidura,%} and consulted with them (I, {@202@}). {%Bhīṣma%} recom-
<div n="lb">mended to give to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} one half of the kingdom
<div n="lb">(I, {@203@}). {%Droṇa%} approved of this, and, moreover, recom-
<div n="lb">mended that a messenger should be sent to {%Drupada%} with
<div n="lb">gifts, and say that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was very glad of the new
<div n="lb">alliance with him, and would take the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to {%Hāstinapura%}
<div n="lb">to be installed on the throne.—§ 242. {%Karṇa%} spoke con-
<div n="lb">temptuously of {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa,%} saying that happiness
<div n="lb">depended on destiny, and not on friends, etc., mentioning the
<div n="lb">{%Magadha%} king {%Ambuvīca (b)%} (I, {@204@}).—§ 243. {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">recommended the suggestion of {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa,%} and said
<div n="lb">that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were invincible, as they were assisted by
<div n="lb">{%Rāma, Janārdana, Sātyaki,%} etc. (I, {@205@}). {%Vidura%} was sent
<div n="lb">by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with numerous jewels, etc., to {%Drupada%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (also {%Kṛṣṇa%} was present). {%Vidura%} said that
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was highly pleased with the alliance with
<div n="lb">{%Drupada,%} and asked {%Drupada%} to permit the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} with
<div n="lb">their mother and wife, to return to their paternal city
<div n="lb">(I, {@206@}).
