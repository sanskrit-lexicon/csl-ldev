[{@Hiḍimbavadhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
killing of Hiḍimba,” the 9th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.)
(cf. Hidimba). § 214 (cf. III, 553 ff.): Not far from that
[Page322-a+ 63]
place dwelt on a {%śāla%} tree the {%Rākṣasa Hiḍimba%}, a cannibal
with eight long and sharp-pointed teeth, etc. Scenting the
odour of man, he sent his sister {%Hiḍimbā%} to slaughter them
and bring them unto him. She fell in love with {%Bhīma%}, and,
assuming a beautiful form, she asked him to become her
husband, and promised to rescue him and his brothers and
mother from her brother; but {%Bhīma%} (“neither men nor
{%Gandhaṛvas%}, nor {%Yakṣas%} are able to bear my might,” v. 5960)
refused to awaken them (I, {@152@}). Seeing that his sister did
not return soon enough, {%Hiḍimba%} proceeded quickly to the
spot, and, abusing his sister, he rushed at her, but was seized
by {%Bhīma%} and dragged to a distance, lest his yells should
awaken the brothers of {%Bhīma%}; fighting they broke down
the trees, etc., and at those sounds the {%Pāṇḍavas%} woke up
with their mother, and saw {%Hiḍimbā%} sitting before them
(I, {@153@}). She made herself and her love for {%Bhīma%} known
to them. {%Arjuna%} offered to assist {%Bhīma%}; but {%Bhīma%} refused.
{%Arjuna%} then said: “The morning twilight is about to set in;
during the twilights {%Rākṣasas%} become stronger; kill him
without delay.” Then {%Bhīma%} threw the {%Rākṣasa%} to the
ground, and he, dying, sent forth a terrible yell; then he
doubled up his body and broke it in the middle. {%Arjuna%}
thought there was a town not far off. Thereto they proceeded,
followed by {%Hiḍimbā%} (I, {@154@}). {%Bhīma%} would also have
slain {%Hiḍimbā%}, but was prevented by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. It was
agreed upon, that she should have {%Bhīma%} for her husband, until
she got a son, sporting with him during the day, but bringing
him back every evening. She then flew away with him, and
sported with him on mountains, etc., until she had brought forth
(the {%Rākṣasa%} women bring forth the very day they conceive
(v. 6077) a bald-headed son, whom they, on account of his
baldness, called {%Ghaṭotkaca%} ({%ghaṭo hāsyotkaca iti%}, v. 6079),
who developed into a young man the very hour he was born,
excelled all {%Piśācas%}, etc., in strength, and soon acquired high
proficiency in all weapons. {%Hiḍimbā%} then went away; and also
{%Ghaṭotkaca%}, who promised that he would come when wanted
for business, went away northwards. It was {%Indra%} who had
created {%Ghaṭotkaca%} as an antagonist for {%Karṇa%}, in consideration
of the latter's lance (I, {@155@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} proceeded from
forest to forest in the garb of ascetics, studying the {%Brāhma%}
{%Veda%}, and the {%Vedāṅgas%}, and the {%nītiśāstra%}, through the countries
of the {%Matsyas, Trigartas, Pāñcālas%}, and {%Kīcakas%}. Then they
met {%Vyāsa%}, who comforted them and led them into the town
of {%Ekacakrā%} to the house of a brahman. He ordered them to
wait here, till he came back, and then went away (I, {@156@}).
