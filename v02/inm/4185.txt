{@Goharaṇaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the robbing of
the kine of Virāṭa,” the 55th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
cf. Gograhaṇa). § 552: Meanwhile the spies of Duryodhana
returned to Hāstinapura and informed Duryodhana, who was
sitting with Droṇa, Karṇa, Kṛpa, Bhīṣma, his brothers, and
the Trigartas, that they had not found out the Pāṇḍavas, but
that Kīcaka ({%b%}) had been slain (IV, {@25@}). Kārṇa and Duḥśāsana
proposed that the other spies should be sent (IV, {@26@}).
Droṇa said: “People like the Pāṇḍavas never perish, let the
abode which the Pāṇḍavas are to occupy now be settled”
(IV, {@27@}). Bhīṣma applauded Droṇa (IV, {@28@}). Kṛpa
recommended precautions (IV, {@29@}). The Trigarta king,
Suśarman, supported by Karṇa, proposed to invade the city
of Virāṭa and to rob his kine and wealth, and thus to take
revenge for the invasions of the Matsyas headed by Kīcaka.
Duryodhana caused Duḥśāsana to array their forces. Suśarman
set out towards the south-east on the seventh day of the dark
fortnight, and the Kauravas on the eighth day (IV, {@30@}).
After Kīcaka had been slain, Virāṭa began to rest his hopes
on the Pāṇḍavas. His brothers, Śatānīka and Madirākṣa,
and the king himself, and Sūryadatta and Śaṅkha, the eldest
son of Virāṭa, put on their coats of mail. Virāṭa also caused
Śatānīka to order chariots for Kaṅka, Vallava, Tantripāla,
and Dāmagranthi (i.e. Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīmasena, Nakula, and
Sahadeva in disguise) (IV, {@31@}). The Matsyas overtook the
Trigartas shortly before sunset. Śatānīka and Viśālākṣa
penetrated into the heart of the Trigarta host. Virāṭa, with
Sūryadatta in his van and Madirākṣa in his rear, began
a single combat from chariots against Suśarman (IV, {@32@}).
The night interrupted the battle for a while, but it began
once more when the moon arose. Suśarman and his younger
brother made Virāṭa prisoner, and the Matsyas began to fly;
Bhīma would uproot a tree, but was prevented by Yudhiṣṭhira,
lest the people should recognize them; then Bhīma, with
Nakula and Sahadeva as protectors of his wheels, rushed
against Suśarman, and the Matsya warriors, Virāṭa's son, and
Yudhiṣṭhira, etc., followed him; the charioteer of Suśarman
was dragged to the ground. Madirāśva came to the aid of
Bhīma. Virāṭa leapt down from the chariot of Suśarman,
[Page310-a+ 63]
seizing the mace of the latter, and ran in pursuit of him;
Suśarman was seized by Bhīma, but set free by Yudhiṣṭhira
(IV, {@33@}). The Pāṇḍavas passed the night on the field of
battle honoured by Virāṭa. As proposed by Yudhiṣṭhira,
Virāṭa ordered messengers to proclaim the victory in the city.
The messengers repaired to the city that very night, and
at sunrise they proclaimed the victory at the city gates
(IV, {@34@}). Meanwhile Duryodhana, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), invaded the
Matsya country and took away the kine. Hearing this,
Bhūmiñjaya (i.e. Uttara), who had been left by the king in
the empty city (IV, {@35@}), and whose charioteer had been slain
in a great battle, followed the advice of Kṛṣṇa (who had
been instigated by Arjuna) and sent Uttarā (IV, {@36@}), who
prevailed upon Bṛhannalā (= Arjuna in disguise) to become
the charioteer of Uttara. Uttarā and her maidens asked
Arjuna to bring fine clothes for their dolls when he had
vanquished the Kurus (IV, {@37@}). Seeing the host of the
Kurus, Uttara became agitated with fear and jumped down
from the chariot and began to flee, but was seized by Arjuna
and made to hold the reins, while Arjuna had to fight (IV,
{@38@}). Bhīṣma, Droṇa, etc., suspected the comer to be Arjuna,
and many portents were explained by Droṇa in that sense.
Karṇa blamed Droṇa, and Duryodhana said that if it were
Arjuna the Pāṇḍavas must go into exile for twelve more
years (IV, {@39@}). Having reached the {%śamī%} tree, Arjuna ordered
Uttara to fetch the weapons of the Pāṇḍavas, including
Gāṇḍīva, which were deposited there (IV, {@40@}). Believing
that a corpse had been tied up in the tree, Uttara refused, but
as Arjuna said: “There are only bows in that tree and no
corpse,” he climbed up and unwrapped and untied the bows
(IV, {@41@}). Arjuna explained to him to whom the different
bows belonged, first mentioning the Gāṇḍīva ({%c%}), which is
honoured by the gods, the Dānavas, and the Gandharvas
(IV, {@42—43@}). He then revealed to Uttara that they were
the Pāṇḍavas and confirmed it by telling his ten names (<lang n="greek">β</lang>)
(IV, {@44@}). Arjuna took off the bracelets from his arms, etc.,
recalled to his mind all his weapons, and twanged the Gāṇḍīva
with a dreadful sound, whence the Kurus knew that he was
Arjuna, then he comforted Uttara by mentioning his former
exploits (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>) and his preceptors in arms (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (IV, {@45@}). Having
taken down the banner with the figure of a lion he set up his
own flagstaff bearing the figure of an ape with a lion's tail,
which was a celestial illusion ({%māyā%}) contrived by Viśva-
karman himself, for as soon as he thought of the gift of Agni,
Agni ordered the superhuman creatures to take their usual
place on that banner, which then fell down from the air on
his chariot (read {%rathe%} with B.). Droṇa concluded from
various omens that it was Arjuna (IV, {@46@}). Duryodhana
repeated to Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and Kṛpa, his and Karṇa's
opinion, that Arjuna must have broken his pledge, and asked
Bhīṣma to calculate the time. Karṇa blamed Droṇa for
praising Arjuna (IV, {@47@}), and declared that he would throw
Arjuna down from his chariot that very day (IV, {@48@}).
Kṛpa blamed Karṇa and warned him from fighting alone with
Arjuna, mentioning his exploits (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); they ought all to fight
with Arjuna and not Karṇa alone (IV, {@49@}). Aśvatthāman
blamed Karṇa for his vain boast and declared that he would
not fight with Arjuna (IV, {@50@}). Bhīṣma tried to mediate
between Aśvatthāman and Kṛpa on one side and Karṇa on
the other side; he was of opinion that fight they must, and
therefore this was not the time for quarrel. “The Brāhmāstra
and the Vedas are never to be seen combined anywhere else
than in Droṇa (and Aśvatthāman).” He was supported by
[Page310-b+ 63]
Aśvatthāman and Duryodhana. Droṇa said; “Let such
arrangements be made that Arjuna may not be able to
approach Duryodhana in battle, and that Duryodhana may
not be captured by the foe” (IV, {@51@}). Having calculated
the time (“an excess of five months and twelve nights in
thirteen years”), Bhīṣma declared that the Pāṇḍavas had
not broken the pledge. Duryodhana said: “I will not give
back the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas.” Bhīṣma proposed that
Duryodhana should proceed towards the capital with one-
fourth of the army, and that one-fourth should escort the
kine, while he, Droṇa, Karṇa, Aśvatthāman, and Kṛpa should
withstand the foes. This proposal was accepted; Bhīṣma
placed Droṇa in the centre, Aśvatthāman on the left wing,
Kṛpa on the right wing, and Karṇa in the van, and would
himself stand in the rear (IV, {@52@}). Droṇa recognized the
top of Arjuna's banner, etc. Arjuna directed Uttara to the
spot where Duryodhana was; the soldiers became so con-
founded that they could not even fly, and the kine turned
back along the southern road (IV, {@53@}). As Arjuna was
advancing towards Duryodhana the Kurus fell upon him,
especially Karṇa, who was supported by Citrasena, Saṅgrā-
majit (the brother of Karṇa), Śatrusaha, Jaya, and Vikarṇa;
Vikarṇa fled; Śatruntapa and many others were slain by
Arjuna, so also Saṅgrāmajit; at last Karṇa took to flight
(IV, {@54@}). Duryodhana, etc., attacked Arjuna; Arjuna shot
at Droṇa, Duḥsaha, Aśvatthāman, Duḥśāsana, and Kṛpa, and
wounded Bhīṣma, Duryodhana, and Karṇa. Then Arjuna
described to Uttara the banners, etc., of Kṛpa, Droṇa,
Aśvatthāman, Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Bhīṣma (IV, {@55@}).
Indra, the gods, the Viśvas, the Aśvins, the Maruts, the Yakṣas,
the Gandharvas, the Mahoragas, the Nāgas, the Rākṣasas, the
serpents, the Pitṛs, and the maharṣis came to see the combat,
likewise, sitting on the chariot of Indra, king Vasumanas, etc.
(<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); also Agni, Śiva, Soma, Varuṇa, Prajāpati, Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ,
Kubera, Yama, Alambuṣa, Ugrasena, Tumburu, etc., came
there (IV, {@56@}). Arjuna attacked Kṛpa, announced his name,
and blew the Devadatta; at last Kṛpa was led away by his
soldiers (IV, {@57@}). Droṇa attacked Arjuna; Arjuna said:
“I will not strike thee unless thou strikest me first”; with
his own weapons Arjuna baffled the Aindra, Vāyavya, and
Āgneya weapons, which were shot by Droṇa; a voice was
heard in the sky applauding Droṇa; then Aśvatthāman
attacked Arjuna, which gave Droṇa an opportunity to leave
the field (IV, {@58@}). Aśvatthāman cut off the string of the
Gāṇḍīva and was applauded by the gods, and by Droṇa,
Bhīṣma, Karṇa, and Kṛpa. Arjuna attached a fresh string
to the Gāṇḍīva. As Aśvatthāman's arrows became exhausted
Karṇa attacked Arjuna (IV, {@59@}), who challenged him to
a single combat and rebuked him, because he had fled after
the slaughter of his younger brother. At last Karṇa,
wounded, fled in a northern direction (IV, {@60@}). Then
Arjuna ordered Uttara to take him to Bhīṣma; Uttara
became afraid and was comforted by Arjuna ({%d%}), who
enumerated some of his exploits and weapons. Duḥśāsana,
Vikarṇa, Duḥsaha, and Viviṃśati rushed towards Arjuna;
Duḥśāsana fled; Vikarṇa fell down; Duḥsaha and Viviṃśati
were taken away by their warriors (IV, {@61@}). At last the
Kauravas fled (IV, {@62@}); Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Duḥśāsana
attempted in vain to defeat Arjuna (IV, {@63@}). Then Bhīṣma
and Arjuna fought with the Prājāpatya, Aindra, Āgneya,
Raudra, Kaubera, Vāruṇa, Yāmya, and Vāyavya weapons;
the Gandharva Citrasena showed the two combatants to
Indra, who showered celestial flowers down upon them;
[Page311-a+ 63]
at last Bhīṣma, wounded, lost consciousness and was led
away by his charioteer (IV, {@64@}). Duryodhana and then
Vikarṇa attacked Arjuna; Vikarṇa ran back and ascended
the chariot of Viviṃśati; Duryodhana was wounded and fled,
and so did all the warriors (IV, {@65@}). Stung by the censure
of Arjuna, Duryodhana returned, and Karṇa, Bhīṣma, Droṇa,
Kṛpa, Viviṃśati, and Duḥśāsana rushed forwards to protect
Duryodhana. Arjuna employed the weapon Sammohana
which he had obtained from Indra, and blew his conch
so that the Kurus were deprived of their senses. Then he
caused Uttara to take away the white garments of Droṇa and
Kṛpa, the yellow ones of Karṇa, and the blue ones of
Duryodhana and Aśvatthāman, but not those of Bhīṣma,
because he had not been stupefied. Arjuna wounded Bhīṣma,
who told Duryodhana to go back to his city, which they all
did; Arjuna followed them for a while and worshipped
Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Aśvatthāman, and Kṛpa; then he, with
an arrow, broke the crown of Duryodhana and blew the
Devadatta. Then he ordered Uttara to turn back. The gods
returned to their respective abodes (IV, {@66@}). A large
number of Kuru soldiers issuing from the forest stood before
Arjuna with joined palms and were spared. Arjuna said to
Uttara: “Do not eulogize the Pāṇḍavas, but say that the
feat is thy own.” Then he replaced the weapons on the {%śamī%}
tree; the monkey ascended to the sky, together with the other
creatures on the flagstaff, the illusion ({%māyā%}) melted away,
and Uttara's own banner was replaced upon the chariot.
Arjuna entered the city in the guise of Bṛhannalā, having
sent the cowherds to announce the victory (IV, {@67@}). Virāṭa
entered his city, followed by the four Pāṇḍavas, and dispatched
an army to protect Uttara, though Yudhiṣṭhira said that,
protected by Bṛhannalā, he was able to vanquish even the
gods, the Asuras, the Siddhas, and the Yakṣas. Meanwhile
the messengers of Uttara came and Virāṭa ordered the
highways to be decorated, etc., and began to play at dice
with Yudhiṣṭhira, who again repeatedly praised Bṛhannalā.
Virāṭa struck Yudhiṣṭhira with a die, but the blood was
prevented from falling on the ground and was washed away
by Kṛṣṇā, who also, at the injunction of Yudhiṣṭhira, let
Uttara enter alone, that Bṛhannalā should not see him
bleeding. Uttara prevailed upon Virāṭa to ask Yudhiṣṭhira's
pardon. When the bleeding had stopped, Bṛhannalā
entered (IV, {@68@}). Uttara said: “All this has been
accomplished by a {%devaputra%} (‘son of a deity’) who then
disappeared.” Arjuna gave to Uttarā the garments he had
brought (IV, {@69@}).
