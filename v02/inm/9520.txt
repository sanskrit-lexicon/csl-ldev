{@Saptasārasvata@},¦ a tīrtha on the Sarasvatī. § 365
(Maṅkaṇaka): III, {@85@}, 6085 (there Maṅkaṇaka won ascetic
success), 7003.—§ 615 (Baladevatīrthayātrā): IX, {@37@},
2184 ({%tīrthaṃ%}, visited by Balarāma); {@38@}, 2186 ({%tīrthaṃ%}).—
§ 615{%i%} (do.): The seven {%Sarasvatīs%} cover this universe.
Whithersoever the {%Sarasvatī%} was summoned, thither she made
her appearance. Her seven forms are {%Suprabhā%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>).
I) {%Pitāmaha%} [i.e. Brahmán] was once performing a sacrifice
at {%Puṣkara%}; whatever he thought of, immediately appeared,
the {%Gandharvas%} sung, the {%Apsarases%} danced. The {%ṛṣis%}
missed {%Sarasvatī, Brahmán%} thought of her and she appeared
there at {%Puṣkara%} under the name of {%Suprabhā%}. II) At
{%Naimiṣa%} many {%munis%} were assembled, performing sacrifices
and talking about the {%Vedas%}, they thought of {%Sarasvatī%}, who
made her appearance and came to be called {%Kāñcanākṣī%}.
III) Similarly she came to the sacrifice of {%Gaya%} in the country
of the {%Gayas (Gayeṣu%}), where she flowed from the slopes of
[Page621-a+ 63]
{%Himavat%} and was called {%Viśālā%}. IV) At the sacrifice of
{%Auddālaki%} in the northern part of {%Kosalā (uttare Kośalābhāge%}),
having been previously thought of by {%Uddālaka%} when
sacrificing, she was mentally called {%Manoramā%} by the {%ṛṣis%}.
V) At {%Kuru's%} sacrifice at {%Kurukṣetra%}, she was summoned by
{%Vasiṣṭha%}, and named {%Oghavatī%}. VI) At {%Dakṣa's%} sacrifice
at {%Gaṅgādvāra%} she appeared under the name of {%Sureṇu%}
(see the note of PCR. pag. 154). VII) At {%Brahmán's%}
sacrifice on the {%Himavat%}, as {%Vimalodā%}. All these seven
forms then came and mingled together in the tīrtha, which
from this is known by the name of {%Saptasārasvata%}. “Thus
I have told thee of the seven Sarasvatīs by their names and
of the tīrtha {%S.%}; listen now to a great feat of {%Maṅkaṇaka%}”:
IX, {@38@}, 2216, 2217.—§ 615{%j%} (Maṅkaṇaka): IX, {@38@}, 2243
(there Maṅkaṇaka dwelt, from his seed which fell in the
Sarasvatī seven ṛṣis were born; the ascetic success of
Maṅkaṇaka, cf. § 365).
