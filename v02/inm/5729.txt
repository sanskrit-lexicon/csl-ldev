{@[Khāṇḍavadahanaparvan(°va)],@}¦ the 19th of the minor
<div n="lb">parvans, in {%C.,%} including also Mayadarśanaparvan, in all
<div n="lb">I, {@222—34@} (cf. Khāṇḍavadāha). § 254: At the instance of
<div n="lb">Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Bhīṣma the Pāṇḍavas at Indraprastha
<div n="lb">began to bring other kings under their sway. All the
<div n="lb">subjects lived happily. Once, in the summer, Arjuna and
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa sported on the banks of the Yamunā with Draupadī
<div n="lb">and Subhadrā, etc. They were then approached by a brahman,
<div n="lb">whose complexion was like molten gold (I, {@222@}). It was
<div n="lb">Agni. He asked them to help him to consume the forest
<div n="lb">of Khāṇḍava and the creatures therein; for Indra always
<div n="lb">prevented him from consuming it, because he was a friend of
<div n="lb">the Nāga Takṣaka, who dwelt there with his followers and
<div n="lb">family.—§§ 255—6, {%a%} (Agniparābhava, q.v.): the antecedents
<div n="lb">of the Khāṇḍavad. (I, {@223, 224@}).—§ 256, {%b:%} Arjuna said
<div n="lb">that he wanted a stronger bow and inexhaustible arrows, and
<div n="lb">a resplendent chariot to ride in, and that Kṛṣṇa needed a
<div n="lb">weapon with which he could slay Nāgas and Piśācas (I, {@224@}).
<div n="lb">—§ 257: Then Agni thought of Varuṇa {%(b),%} who presented
<div n="lb">Arjuna with: (1) the Gāṇḍīva bow {%(c);%} (2) two inexhaustible
[Page406-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">quivers; (3) a chariot yoked with horses. Then Agni gave to
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa: (1) a discus (Sudarśana) {%(d).%} Varuṇa, after this,
<div n="lb">gave to Kṛṣṇa: (2) the mace Kaumodakī {%(e).%} They were
<div n="lb">then ready to fight, and Agni began to consume the forest
<div n="lb">(I, {@225@}).—§ 258: Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa prevented the creatures
<div n="lb">from escaping. Even the gods became afraid and applied to
<div n="lb">Indra. Indra poured down showers of rain, that were at
<div n="lb">first dried up in the sky by the heat of the fire (I, {@226@}).
<div n="lb">When more rain was poured down, Arjuna dispelled it with
<div n="lb">a shower of his weapons. Takṣaka was not present, having
<div n="lb">gone to Kurukṣetra. But his son Aśvasena was there; his
<div n="lb">mother, a she-snake, attempted to swallow him, but had her
<div n="lb">head cut off by Arjuna; Indra, raising a violent wind,
<div n="lb">for a moment deprived Arjuna of his consciousness, during
<div n="lb">which time Aśvasena effected his escape, being cursed by
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna, and Agni (“never shalt thou be famous”).
<div n="lb">Indra assailed Arjuna with clouds, which were dispersed by
<div n="lb">the Vāyavya weapon, and with a shower of stones, and with
<div n="lb">a peak from the Mandara, but in vain. Garutmat (Garuḍa)
<div n="lb">and other birds, and Nāgas, who also assailed Kṛṣṇa and
<div n="lb">Arjuna, were vanquished; and As., G., Y., Rā., and Nāgas
<div n="lb">were defeated by Arjuna, as were the Dai. and Dā. by
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa with his discus. They were also attacked by Yama
<div n="lb">with his death-dealing mace, Kubera with his spiked club,
<div n="lb">Varuṇa with his noose and beautiful missile, Skanda with his
<div n="lb">long lance, the Aśvins with resplendent plants, Dhātṛ with
<div n="lb">his bow, Jaya with a thick club, Tvaṣṭṛ with a huge
<div n="lb">mountain, Sūrya with a bright śakti, Mṛtyu with a battle-
<div n="lb">axe, Aryaman with a bludgeon furnished with sharp spikes,
<div n="lb">Mitra with a discus sharp as a razor, Pūṣan, Bhaga, Savitṛ,
<div n="lb">R., V., M., V.-D., and S. (I, {@227@}). With his discus Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">slaughtered Pś., N., Rā., Dā., As., etc. The gods retired from
<div n="lb">the scene. Indra became filled with joy and applauded
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. An incorporeal voice addressed him,
<div n="lb">saying that Takṣaka was in Kurukṣetra, and that Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">and Arjuna, being the old ṛṣis and gods Nara and Nārā-
<div n="lb">yaṇa, were invincible, and that the destruction of the forest
<div n="lb">of Khāṇḍava had been ordained by fate. Then also Indra
<div n="lb">went back to heaven. The Vidyādharas, etc., dwelling in
<div n="lb">that forest, all became frightened. Agni, drinking the nectar-
<div n="lb">like stream of animal fat, became filled with joy. When the
<div n="lb">Asura Maya, the brother of Namuci, was about to be slain by
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa and burnt by Agni, Arjuna rescued him. Agni
<div n="lb">burnt the forest for fifteen days, sparing only six of its
<div n="lb">dwellers: Aśvasena, Maya, and four śārṅgakas (a sort of
<div n="lb">birds, Nīl.) (I, {@228@}).—§ 259 (Śārṅgakopākhyāna, q.v.):
<div n="lb">I, {@229,@} 1-{@234,@} 4, (8331—8464).—§ 260: When Agni had
<div n="lb">consumed fat, marrow, and flesh in abundance, and burnt the
<div n="lb">forest for fifteen days, he became gratified and extinguished
<div n="lb">himself. Indra, with M., appeared before Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna,
<div n="lb">and granted them a boon. Arjuna asked him to give him all
<div n="lb">his weapons (both the Āgneya and the Vāyavya), and Indra
<div n="lb">promised to give them when Mahādeva had been pleased
<div n="lb">with him. To Kṛṣṇa he granted that his friendship with
<div n="lb">Arjuna should be eternal. Then he ascended to heaven with
<div n="lb">the celestials. Arjuna, Vāsudeva, and the Dānava Maya,
<div n="lb">having wandered a little, sat down on the bank of a river
<div n="lb">(I, {@234@}).
