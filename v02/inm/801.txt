<div n="lb">(do.): I, {@95,@} 3827 (his son with Kṛṣṇā was Śrutakīrti),
<div n="lb">3830 (his son with Subhadrā was Abhimanyu). After Pāṇḍu
<div n="lb">had been cursed, that he should have no progeny, he caused

<div n="lb">procreate Bhīmasena, and then Indra to procreate Arjuna.—
<div n="lb">§ 190{%d%} (Pāṇḍavotp.): I, {@123:@} In order to propitiate {%Indra%}

<div n="lb">this voice, the ascetics dwelling on {%Śataśṛṅga%} became ex-
<div n="lb">ceedingly glad. There was heard the sound of {%dundubhis,%}
<div n="lb">and flowers were showered down. The various tribes of
<div n="lb">celestials {%(devagaṇāḥ),%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), came there (enumeration,
<div n="lb">among others, of {%Devagandharvas, Apsarases,%} the twelve

<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas after the death of Pāṇḍu were brought to
<div n="lb">Hāstinapura and educated by Droṇa, under the supervision
<div n="lb">of Bhīṣma. Their cousins (the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra) hated
<div n="lb">them, especially Duryodhana, who tried to murder Bhīmasena
<div n="lb">and later on all the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī (Mādrī had burnt
<div n="lb">herself with the corpse of Pāṇḍu), and Karṇa hated Arjuna
<div n="lb">from jealousy.—§ 203{%b%} (cf. Droṇa): I, {@132:@} One day
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} asked his pupils to promise to accomplish what
<div n="lb">he had on his heart; only {%Arjuna%} promised it. {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">became the foremost of all his fellow-pupils. {%Droṇa%} gave
<div n="lb">every one of his pupils a narrow-mouthed vessel {%(kamaṇḍalu)%}
<div n="lb">for fetching water, in order that much time might be spent
<div n="lb">in filling it, but to {%Aśvatthāman%} he gave a broad-mouthed
<div n="lb">vessel {%(kumbha),%} and in the intervals so gained he used to
<div n="lb">instruct his son in several superior methods; but {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">filled the vessel by means of the {%Vāruṇa%} weapon, and used
[Page069-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">to come at the same time as {%Aśvatthāman. Droṇa%} told the
<div n="lb">cook never to give {%Arjuna%} his food in the dark, but not to
<div n="lb">tell him that it was he {%(Droṇa)%} that had ordered this. One
<div n="lb">day a wind put the lamp out when {%Arjuna%} was taking his
<div n="lb">food; but his hand went up to his mouth from habit. His
<div n="lb">attention being thus called to the force of habit, {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">practised with his bow in the night, and {%Droṇa%} promised him
<div n="lb">that there should not be a bowman equal to him in the world.
<div n="lb">He taught him also to fight on horseback, etc., with the
<div n="lb">mace, etc.: 5217, 5218, 5224, 5225, 5230, 5232, 5233,
<div n="lb">5238.—§ 204 (Ekalavya): I, {@132,@} 5252 (Droṇa took from
<div n="lb">Ekalavya as his fee the thumb of his right hand in order that
<div n="lb">he might not surpass Arjuna).—§ 205{%e%} (cf. Droṇa): I, {@132,@}
<div n="lb">5273, 5274: Arjuna excelled everyone in every respect, and
<div n="lb">alone became an {%atiratha%} (“a charioteer capable of fighting

<div n="lb">{@132<lang n="greek"></lang>,@} 5293, 5296. One day Droṇa caused an artificial bird
<div n="lb">to be placed on the top of a tree, and first repeatedly asked
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira to tell what he did see, while aiming at the
<div n="lb">bird. He answered that he saw the tree, Droṇa, his
<div n="lb">brothers, and the bird. Droṇa reproachfully told him to
<div n="lb">stand apart. Then Droṇa repeated the experiment with his
<div n="lb">other pupils, with the same result (ch. {@132@}). At last
<div n="lb">Arjuna's turn came; he said first that he saw only the
<div n="lb">vulture, and then that he saw only its head, and, when
<div n="lb">Droṇa gave the order, he struck off its head with his shaft
<div n="lb">(I, {@133@}).—§ 207 (do.): I, {@133:@} Arjuna rescued the life
<div n="lb">of Droṇa by shooting with five arrows an alligator in the
<div n="lb">Gaṅgā that had seized his thigh. Droṇa gave him the
<div n="lb">weapon Brahmaśiras on the condition that he should not use
<div n="lb">it against a human foe, as it might burn the whole universe.
<div n="lb">—§ 208{%b%} (cf. Astradarśana): I, {@135:@} Then {%Arjuna%} appeared,
<div n="lb">while {%Kuntī%} wept with joy, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} learned from
<div n="lb">{%Vidura%} who it was. By the {%Āgneya%} weapon {%Arjuna%} created
<div n="lb">fire, by the {%Vāruṇa%} water, by the {%Vāyavya%} air, by the {%Pārjanya%}
<div n="lb">clouds; by means of the {%Pārvata%} a mountain came into
<div n="lb">being (v. 5366, read with V. {%“abhavadgiriḥ”%} or with B.
<div n="lb">{%“asṛjadgirīn”%}), and by the {%Antardhāna%} weapon it again
<div n="lb">disappeared, etc.; he at one time shot five shafts together
<div n="lb">into the mouth of a moving iron boar, and discharged
<div n="lb">twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a cow's horn hung up
<div n="lb">in a rope and swaying to and fro (v. 5370, instead of {%“bale”%}
<div n="lb">read with B. and V. {%“cale”%}).—§ 208 (Astradarśana): I, {@137,@}
<div n="lb">5440, 5442: At the show of arms Karṇa in vain challenged
<div n="lb">Arjuna.—§ 209 (Drupadaśāsana): I, {@138,@} 5484, 5492,
<div n="lb">5499, 5500, 5501. Arjuna helped Droṇa to subjugate
<div n="lb">Drupada, which favour Droṇa had asked as his fee.—
<div n="lb">§ 210{%c%} (cf. Sambhavaparvan): I, {@139:@} {%Droṇa%} taught {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">Brahmaśiras (that he had learnt from {%Agniveśa,%} the disciple
<div n="lb">of {%Agastya%}), on the condition that he should not hurl
<div n="lb">it at any human being (cf. § 207), and obtained from
<div n="lb">him as his fee the promise that he would fight with him
<div n="lb">[in the great battle]. Then {%Arjuna%} went away to the
<div n="lb">northern region.—§ 211 (Sambhavap.): I, {@139,@} 5537, 5538.
<div n="lb">Headed by Arjuna, the Pāṇḍavas in war slew Sauvīra, who
<div n="lb">had performed a three years' sacrifice at the inroad of the
<div n="lb">Gandharvas. The Yavana king, whom even Pāṇḍu had
<div n="lb">failed to subject, was subdued by Arjuna; as was also the
<div n="lb">Sauvīra Vitula (B. {%Vipula%}), who had always shown a dis-
<div n="lb">regard for the Kurus; and the Sauvīra Sumitra, called
<div n="lb">Dattāmitra (LIA. i, pp. 656/804, n. 2); assisted by Bhīma,
<div n="lb">Arjuna with only a single chariot subjugated all the kings of
<div n="lb">the east {%(prācyāḥ)%} backed by 10,000 chariots; and in the
[Page069-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">same way the south. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sentiments towards the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas suddenly became poisoned, and from anxiety he

<div n="lb">himself (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and asked for Yudhiṣṭhira's forgiveness,

<div n="lb">M.-ṛ., P. (subsisting upon Svadhā), etc., and Brahmán with
<div n="lb">B.-ṛ., and Prajāpatis, and Bhava. Indra wished that {%A.%}

<div n="lb">{%A.;%} the gods urged Brahmán that the success of both should
<div n="lb">be equal, Indra that {%A.%} and Kṛṣṇa should win; Brahmán
[Page082-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">and Īśāna (i.e. Śiva) said that the victory of {%A.%} was certain
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>): “let Karṇa obtain identity with V. or M., let him
<div n="lb">be worshipped in heaven with Droṇa and Bhīṣma.” Indra
<div n="lb">acquiesced by their words. Description of Karṇa's and {%A.'s%}
<div n="lb">chariots; the ape on {%A.'s%} banner attacked the elephant's rope
<div n="lb">on Karṇa's banner. Kṛṣṇa and Śalya darted keen glances at
<div n="lb">each other, and so did {%A.%} and Karṇa. Śalya said that he would
<div n="lb">slay both Kṛṣṇa and {%A.%} if Karṇa was slain; Kṛṣṇa said that
<div n="lb">Karṇa could not slay {%A.;%} otherwise, the destruction of the
<div n="lb">universe would be at hand, and he would himself slay Karṇa
<div n="lb">and Śalya. {%A.%} said that that day the wives of Karṇa would
<div n="lb">become widows (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VIII, {@87@}). In the welkin D., N.,
<div n="lb">As., Si., Y., G., Rā., Aps., and B.-ṛ., etc., looked on. The
<div n="lb">battle commenced. {%A.%} defeated Duryodhana, etc. (VIII,
<div n="lb">{@88@}); description of the battle between {%A.%} and Karṇa; {%A.%}
<div n="lb">employed an Āgneya weapon, which was neutralized by
<div n="lb">Karṇa with a Vāruṇa weapon by means of clouds, which
<div n="lb">was in its turn dispelled by {%A.%} by means of a Vāyavya
<div n="lb">weapon; {%A.%} employed the Aindra weapon {%(? dayitaṃ deva-%}
<div n="lb">{%rājñaḥ; Mahendrasyāstraṃ),%} Karṇa the Bhārgava weapon.
<div n="lb">Seeing {%A.'s%} weapons neutralized by Karṇa, Bhīma (<lang n="greek"></lang>) and
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa (<lang n="greek"></lang>) urged {%A.%} to put forth his strength. {%A.%} bowed
<div n="lb">to Brahmán and invoked the Brāhma weapon, which could be
<div n="lb">applied by the mind alone; Karṇa neutralized it; urged by
<div n="lb">Bhīma, {%A.%} applied a second Brāhma weapon, which caused
<div n="lb">a great carnage among the Kaurava troops (description).
<div n="lb">{%A.%} shot at Karṇa and Śalya and slew Sabhāpati, etc. The
<div n="lb">Kauravas urged Karṇa to slay {%A.%} Yudhiṣṭhira appeared in
<div n="lb">order to witness the encounter. {%A.'s%} bowstring burst; Karṇa
<div n="lb">pierced {%A.%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Karṇa employed five snakes as arrows;
<div n="lb">they were cut off by {%A.,%} who slew 2,000 Kurus. The Kurus
<div n="lb">fled, leaving Karṇa to fight alone with {%A.%} (VIII, {@89@}). The
<div n="lb">snake Aśvasena entered into Karṇa's quiver in the form of an
<div n="lb">arrow. Karṇa and {%A.%} were fanned and sprinkled with
<div n="lb">fragrant sandal-water by many Aps., staying in the welkin,
<div n="lb">and Śakra and Sūrya gently brushed their faces with their
<div n="lb">hands. Karṇa aimed that arrow which he had long kept for
<div n="lb">{%A.'s%} destruction. Omens appeared; Karṇa did not know that
<div n="lb">Aśvasena had entered his arrow. Kṛṣṇa with his feet
<div n="lb">pressed {%A.'s%} car about a cubit into the earth and the snake-
<div n="lb">arrow only broke his diadem (made by Svayambhū for
<div n="lb">Indra > {%A.%}); incapable of being crushed by Rudra, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">Karṇa would not shoot the same weapon again. Aśvasena then
<div n="lb">of his own accord came towards {%A.%} in the shape of an arrow;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa informed {%A.; A.%} cut off the snake, and Kṛṣṇa raised
<div n="lb">the chariot from the earth. Once, when Karṇa was stupefied,
<div n="lb">{%A.%} did not wish to slay him, but he was taught by Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">never to spare an enemy. Karṇa invoked the Brāhma weapon
<div n="lb">and {%A.%} the Aindra weapon, which was neutralized by Karṇa;
<div n="lb">urged by Kṛṣṇa to shoot “high weapons,” {%A.%} shot the Brāhma
<div n="lb">weapon. Karṇa cut off eleven bowstrings of {%A.'s%} one after
<div n="lb">another, not knowing that {%A.%} had 100 strings to his bow;
<div n="lb">urged by Kṛṣṇa to strike Karṇa with “superior weapons,”
<div n="lb">{%A.%} then consecrated another celestial weapon with mantras,
<div n="lb">uniting the Raudra weapon with it. At that time the earth
<div n="lb">swallowed up Karṇa's wheels. Karṇa asked {%A.%} to wait for
<div n="lb">a moment till he had raised his sunken wheel (VIII, {@90@}).
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa urged {%A.%} to pierce Karṇa with a celestial weapon;
<div n="lb">{%A.%} kindled with fury; blazing flames of fire seemed to
<div n="lb">emanate from all the pores of his body. Both Karṇa and {%A.%}
<div n="lb">invoked the Brāhma weapon; {%A.%} shot an Agni weapon,
<div n="lb">which was neutralized by Karṇa with the Vāruṇa weapon,
<div n="lb">spreading darkness in all directions, which {%A.%} dispelled
[Page083-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">with the Vāyavya weapon. Pierced by a shaft of Karṇa's,
<div n="lb">{%A.%} began to reel, etc.; Karṇa in vain endeavoured to
<div n="lb">extricate his chariot. Recovering his senses, {%A.%} took up an
<div n="lb">Añjalika weapon. Urged by Kṛṣṇa, {%A.%} cut off Karṇa's
<div n="lb">standard, and then struck off Karṇa's head with an Añjalika
<div n="lb">weapon (the Ṛ. loudly crying out “Peace be to the
<div n="lb">universe!”) (VIII, {@91@}). {%A.%} fought the chariots of the
<div n="lb">Kauravas. {%A.%} and Kṛṣṇa blew their conchs; D., G., men,
<div n="lb">Cā., M.-ṛ., Y., and M.-U. congratulated {%A.%} (VIII, {@94@}). Urged
<div n="lb">by Kṛṣṇa (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%A.%} presented himself to Yudhiṣṭhira, who
<div n="lb">greeted {%A.%} and Kṛṣṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira, with Kṛṣṇa and {%A.,%}
