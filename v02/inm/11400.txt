{@Vaiṣṇavāstra@}¦ (“the weapon belonging to Viṣṇu”).
§ 592 (Saṃśaptakavadhap.): VII, {@29@}, 1272 (employed by
Bhagadatta).—§ 592{%c%} (do.): Kṛṣna has four forms: 1) one,
staving on earth, engaged in ascetic austerities: 2) one,
[Page703-b+ 63]
beholding good and evil deeds in the world; 3) one,
coming into the world of men and engaged in action;
4) one, reposing in sleep for 1,000 years, and at the end
of the 1,000 years granting, upon awakening, excellent
boons. The Earth ({%Pṛthivī%}), knowing that that time had
come, asked of him as a boon for [her son] {%Naraka%}, that he,
possessed of the {%Vaiṣṇavāstra%}, should become incapable of
being slain by gods and Asuras. The boon was granted.
From {%Naraka%}, the king of {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} (i.e. Bhagadatta) got
this weapon, that may slay even {%Indra%} and {%Rudra%}: VII, {@29@},
1284, [1285 ({%astraṃ…Vaiṣṇavaṃ%})].
