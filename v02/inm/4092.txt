{@vāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation between Gautamī, the fowler,
the serpent, Death, and Time”). § 719{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.):
{%Bhīṣma%} said: An old brahman lady named {%Gautamī%} found
her son dead, bitten by a serpent; an angry fowler, {%Arjunaka%},
bound the serpent with a string and brought it before
{%Gautamī%}; she told him to release it, as {%brahmans%} do not
harbour resentment, and there is no good in tormenting and
killing an enemy; the fowler mentioned how {%Indra%} killed
{%Vṛtra%} and {%Mahādeva%} destroyed a sacrifice. The serpent said
that {%Mṛtyu%} had sent him on this errand. {%Mṛtyu%} (masc.)
appeared and said that {%Kāla%} (Time) was the real promoter;
{%Sūrya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) are created and destroyed by {%Kāla. Kāla%}
came and said that it was the child's {%karman%} (deeds in the
past) that was the cause; this was approved of by {%Gautamī%}
and the fowler.
