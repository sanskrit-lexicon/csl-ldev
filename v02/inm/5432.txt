(counsellor of Duryodhana).—§ 81{%b%} (do.): {%K%}. was born of
Kuntī and Sūrya, with his armour and ear-rings: I, {@63@},
2427.—§ 131{%b%} (Kuntī): When Kuntī had thrown her child
into the water, it was taken up by the husband of Rādhā
and called Vasuṣeṇa. He grew very strong and soon
mastered the vedāṅgas; there was nothing he would not give
to the brahmans. In order to benefit Arjuna, Indra in the
guise of a brahman obtained his ear-rings and armour, and in
return gave him a lance with which he could slay any one
amongst gods, Asuras, men, Gandharvas, and Rākṣasas.
Because he took off ({%utkṛtya%}) his natural armour and ear-rings
he was called Vaikartana Karṇa. He was the friend and
counsellor of Duryodhana: I, {@66@}, [2776 ({%Vasuṣeṇeti…%}

became the disciple of Droṇa in the Dhanurveda).]—§ 208{%c%}
(Astradarśana): When the exhibition had nearly ended there
was heard proceeding from the gate the slapping of arms like
to the roar of thunder. Then {%K%}. (the son of {%Pṛthā%} and the
[Page384-b+ 63]
Sun) proceeded with his natural mail and ear-ring and bowed
to {%Droṇa%} and {%Kṛpa%}. Having spoken disdainfully to {%Arjuna%},
at which {%Duryodhana%} was filled with delight, he then, with
the permission of {%Droṇa%}, did all that {%Arjuna%} had done
before. {%Duryodhana%} and his brothers in joy embraced {%K%}.
{%K%}. asked for a single combat with {%Arjuna%}, who rebuked
him. {%Droṇa%} gave his consent to the encounter. {%Indra%}
covered {%Arjuna%} with clouds, while the Sun dispersed the
clouds from {%K.%}, who remained visible, surrounded by the
rays of the Sun. When {%Kṛpa%} asked {%K%}. to tell his lineage
(“sons of kings never fight with men of inferior lineage,”
v. 5411) {%K%}. was ashamed, but {%Duryodhana%} (saying, “The
origin of kings is, according to the {%śāstras%}, threefold—persons
of noble blood, heroes, and those who lead an army,” v. 5413)
immediately installed {%K%}. king of the Aṅgas (I, {@136@}). Then
{%Adhiratha%} entered the lists and embraced {%K%}. as his son
{%Bhīmasena%}, seeing this, scoffed at {%K%}. as the son of a charioteer
({%sūta%}), but was reprimanded by {%Duryodhana%} (“the origin of
heroes and rivers is always unknown,” examples: the fire that
rises from the water; the thunderbolt ({%vajra%}) that was made
from the bones of {%Dadhīca; Guha%}, i.e. Skanda, is named the
son of {%Agni%} or of the {%Kṛttikāḥ%} or of {%Rudra%} or of {%Gaṅgā%};
{%Viśvāmitra%} and other kṣatriyas who became brahmans;
{%Droṇa%} and {%Kṛpa%}). When the sun went down {%Duryodhana%}
led {%K%}. out of the arena. {%Kuntī%} had recognized {%K%}. as her son
and was pleased at his success. {%Duryodhana%} banished his
fear of {%Arjuna%} when he had obtained {%Karṇa's%} friendship

{%mejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related the secret which was not
revealed to {%K%}. by {%Sūrya. Pṛthā%} (i.e. {%Kuntī%}), the sister of
{%Vasudeva%} and the daughter of the {%Vṛṣṇi Śūra%} and adopted
by King {%Kuntibhoja%}, was ordered by {%Kuntibhoja%} to wait upon
a brahman of fierce energy (III, {@303, 304@}). After a year
the brahman gave her a mantra ({%Atharvaśirasi śrutaṃ%}), by
which she might invoke the gods (III, {@305@}). When she at
the time of her seasons saw the sun's orbit she became possessed
of celestial power of vision, and beheld {%Sūrya%} with his coat
of mail and his ear-rings and invoked him. By way of {%yoga%}
he divided himself into two, one of whom appeared before
{%Kuntī%}. At first {%Kuntī%} was frightened (III, {@306@}), but
{%Sūrya%} reassured her, saying: “Thou shalt remain a virgin
[Page385-b+ 63]
after having gratified me, and thy son shall have the ear-rings
and the coat of mail, made of amṛta, that have been given to
me by {%Aditi%},” etc.; then he entered her by virtue of {%yoga%}
(III, {@307@}). This happened in the bright fortnight of the
tenth month ({%śukle daśottare pakṣe%}). Except her nurse
nobody else knew about the matter; when the child was born
she consulted with her nurse and placed it in a box on the river
{%Aśvanadī%}, imploring protection from {%Varuṇa, Sūrya%}, A., V.,
R., S., V.-D., M., {%diśaḥ, digīśvarāḥ%}, I., etc.; from {%Aśvanadī%} the
basket floated to the river {%Carmaṇvatī%}, thence to the {%Yamunā%},
and so on to the {%Gaṅgā%}, to the town of {%Campā%}, in the country
of the {%Aṅgas%} (III, {@308@}), ruled by the sūta {%Adhiratha%} (the
husband of {%Rādhā%}), who was childless. They adopted the child
and called him {%Vasuṣeṇa%} and {%Vṛṣa%} (only afterwards he was
named {%K%}.). After having adopted {%K., Adhiratha%} had other
sons begotten by himself. When {%K%}. had grown up he was
sent to {%Hāstinapura%}, and acquired the four kinds of weapons
from {%Droṇa, Kṛpa%}, and {%Rāma%}, and became the friend of
{%Duryodhana%}, but was intent on injuring the {%Pāṇḍavas%},
especially {%Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira%} was afraid of him. When
{%K%}. after rising from the water at noon worshipped {%Sūrya%},
brahmans used to solicit him for wealth, and there was
nothing that he would not give away to the brahmans (III,
{@309@}). {%Indra%} in the guise of a brahman appeared before him,
asked him for his coat of mail, and gave him instead a dart
({%Vāsavī%}), which could not be baffled and which, in the hands
of {%Indra%}, destroyed the {%Daityas%} and then returned to him.
“This dart can only slay one powerful enemy of thine and
then it will return to me, but it will not be that one which thou
seekest to slay, for he is protected by {%Kṛṣṇa%}.” {%K%}. cut the coat
of mail and ear-rings off his person, {%Indra%} having granted him
that his body thus disfigured should not become unsightly.
Gods and men and {%Dānavas%} raised a leonine roar. For this feat
he was called {%Karṇa%}. The {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} became distressed
and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were filled with joy. Having rescued {%Kṛṣṇā%}
from {%Jayadratha%} and listened to the ancient stories recited
by {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} returned from {%Kāmyaka%} to
{%Dvaitavana%} (III, {@310@}): III, {@303@}, 16998; {@309@}, 17172,
