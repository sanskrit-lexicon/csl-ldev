{@Āpavopākhyāna@}¦ (“episode relating to Āpava, i.e.
<div n="lb">Vasiṣṭha”). § 164 (cf. Bhīṣmotp.): {%Gaṅgā%} fully related
<div n="lb">to {%Śāntanu%} the reason why the {%Brahmarṣi Vasiṣṭha%} (or
<div n="lb">{%Āpava%}), the son of {%Varuṇa,%} had cursed the {%Vasus.%} When
<div n="lb">the {%Vasus, Pṛthu%} (or {%Dhara%}), etc., were wandering with their
<div n="lb">wives in the wood near {%Vasiṣṭha's%} hermitage, frequented by
<div n="lb">the {%devarṣis, Dyaus%} was prevailed upon by his wife (assisted
<div n="lb">by his brothers), in the interest of her friend {%Jitavatī,%}
<div n="lb">daughter of {%Uśīnara,%} to steal {%Vasiṣṭha's homadhenu [Nandinī]%}
<div n="lb">(daughter of {%Kaśyapa%} and {%Surabhi,%} the daughter of {%Dakṣa%}),
<div n="lb">by drinking whose milk one could remain in unchanged
<div n="lb">youth for 1,000 years. {%Vasiṣṭha,%} however, was prevailed
<div n="lb">upon to let among them {%Dyaus%} alone (who was to be con-
<div n="lb">versant with all {%śāstras,%} etc.) dwell on earth for a long time
<div n="lb">without marrying. Then {%Gaṅgā,%} taking with her the child
<div n="lb">({%Gāṅgeya%} or {%Devavrata,%} i.e. {%Bhīṣma%}), went away, and {%Śāntanu%}
<div n="lb">returned to his capital—“I shall now recount the virtues
<div n="lb">of the {%Bhārata Śāntanu,%} whose splendid story is called the
<div n="lb">{%Mahābhārata%}” (I, {@99@}). (For continuation v. Satyavatīlabhop.)
