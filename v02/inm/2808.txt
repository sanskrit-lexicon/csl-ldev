{@Śukakṛti(ḥ)@}¦ (“the works of Śuka”). § 713 (Mokṣadh.):
XII, {@326—7@} (12215—12311) (continuation of {%Śukotpatti%}).
{%Bhīṣma%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira: Vyāsa%} desired {%Śuka%} to study
the {%Mokṣadharma; Śuka%} mastered all the treatises on {%yoga%},
as also the science promulgated by {%Kapila%}. Then {%Vyāsa%} caused
him to go to {%Janaka%}, the king of {%Mithilā%}, and not to the skies
(by his {%yoga%} power); nor should he think himself superior to
{%Janaka%}, though he was only his {%yājya%}. Crossing the Varṣas
of {%Meru%} and {%Hari%} and {%Himavat (Meror Hareś ca dve varṣe%}
{%varṣaṃ Haimavatan tataḥ), Śuka%} came to {%Bhāratavarṣa%}.
Having seen many countries inhabited by {%Cīnas%} and {%Hūṇas%},
he reached {%Āryāvarta%}, and at last the country of the {%Videhas%},
protected by {%Janaka%}, and then {%Mithilā%}. He had not been
fatigued on the way. He obtained permission to enter the
city, but was at first roughly forbidden to enter the palace.
At last he was admitted into the first chamber; thence he was
led into the second chamber by the minister, and thence into
a garden that was like a second {%Caitraratha%}, with damsels
equal to the Aps., who entertained {%Śuka%} and gave him to
eat; he, however, went unaffected through his rites, and in
the first part of the night he devoted himself to {%yoga%} (XII,
{@326@}). The next morning he was received by {%Janaka%}, and
was instructed by him about {%mokṣa%} and the duties of
a brahman; “ordinarily the purified understanding necessary
for attaining {%mokṣa%} cannot be obtained without passing
through all four stages of religious life; but he who in the
course of many births has obtained a pure mind, may attain
to {%mokṣa%} even in the very first stage (i.e. brahmacarya), and
then there is no need for the three other stages,” quoting
a saying of king {%Yayāti%}; “through the favour of thy father
I have acquired to omniscience; thy knowledge is much
greater than what you think it to be” (XII, {@327@}). (For
continuation v. {%Śukakṛtya%}.)
