[{@Nārāyaṇīya(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the section treating of Nārāyaṇa”):
<div n="lb">§ 717{%b%} (Mokṣadh.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: “I heard it from my
<div n="lb">father that in the {%Kṛta%} age, during the epoch of {%Manu%}
<div n="lb">{%Svāyambhuva,%} the eternal {%Nārāyaṇa,%} the Soul of the
<div n="lb">universe, took birth as the son of {%Dharma%} in a quadruple
<div n="lb">form: as {%Nara, Nārāyaṇa, Hari,%} and the Self-existent
<div n="lb">{%(Svayambhuvaḥ!) Kṛṣṇa.%} Amongst them all, {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Nara%} practised the several austerities, repairing to the
<div n="lb">{%Himālayan%} hermitage {%Badarī%} and riding in their golden
<div n="lb">chariot (description; v. the note of PCR., p. 740). {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">dropped down on {%Gandhamādana%} from a summit of {%Meru%}
<div n="lb">and wandered over all the world, and at last repaired to
<div n="lb">{%Badarī%} at the hour of {%Nara's%} and {%Nārāyaṇa's%} performing
<div n="lb">their daily rites. He said to himself: this is truly the
[Page512-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">abode of that Being in whom are established all the worlds
<div n="lb">including D., As., G., K., and M. -U.; in this spot {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Hari%} dwelt formerly; what is that deity whom these
<div n="lb">two worship? who are these {%Pitṛs%} whom these two {%Pitṛs%}
<div n="lb">of all beings adore?” Ṛ. {%Nārada,%} bowing unto {%Mahādeva,%}
<div n="lb">praised {%Nārāyaṇa%} (“sung in the {%Vedas, Purāṇas, Aṅgas,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Upāṅgas%}”), and asked what god or {%Pitṛ%} he was
<div n="lb">sacrificing to. {%Nārāyaṇa%} said that about this topic nothing
<div n="lb">should be said, as it was an ancient mystery; but because
<div n="lb">of his devotion he instructed him about {%Kṣetrajña,%} etc. The
<div n="lb">twenty-one {%Prajāpatis: Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) were first born,
<div n="lb">and obeyed the eternal law of the Supreme God (XII, {@335@}).
<div n="lb">{%Nārada (Pārameṣṭhya)%} proceeded to {%Śvetadvīpa%} (“White
<div n="lb">Island”) to behold {%Nārāyaṇa%} in his original shape; by
<div n="lb">{%yoga%} he soared into the firmament, rested for a short while
<div n="lb">on a summit of {%Meru,%} then he directed his eyes towards the
<div n="lb">north-west, and north of the milky ocean he saw the
<div n="lb">large island {%Śvetadvīpa,%} more than 32,000 {%yojanas%} from
<div n="lb">{%Meru;%} the inhabitants of that realm have no senses, etc.
<div n="lb">(description); they are white and free from every sin, etc.
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked for further information about this people.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} related the story of {%Uparicara (c),%} “the essence
<div n="lb">of all narratives,” which he had heard from his father
<div n="lb">(XII, {@336—8@}). Arrived at {%Śvetadvīpa, Nārada%} stood in
<div n="lb">{%yoga%} and hymned {%Nārāyaṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) [i.e. Mahāpuruṣastava]
<div n="lb">(XII, {@339@}). {%Nārāyaṇa%} showed himself to {%Nārada,%} bearing
<div n="lb">all forms ({%viśvarūpadhṛk;%} enumeration), uttering with his
<div n="lb">mouths {%Gāyatrī, oṃ,%} and the {%Āraṇyaka,%} and the four Vedas;
<div n="lb">he mentioned {%Ekata, Dvita,%} and {%Trita,%} and instructed
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vāsudeva = Soul = Jīva = Śeṣa = Saṅkarṣaṇa%}
<div n="lb">(when he takes birth as {%Jīva%}) = {%Kṣetrajña; > Sanatkumāra%}
<div n="lb">{%= Mind = Pradyumna; > the Creator = Aniruddha = Īśāna =%}
<div n="lb">{%Īśvara = Ahaṅkāra.%} “I am known as {%Puruṣa;%} without
<div n="lb">acts I am the 25th. {%Hiraṇyagarbha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), are in me.”
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa's%} boons to {%Brahmán%} in days of yore. “I am
<div n="lb">{%Kapila,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Brahmán%} springs from {%Aniruddha's%} navel.”
<div n="lb">The feats that {%Nārāyaṇa%} will perform (those that he will
<div n="lb">slay; his incarnations) (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “in the {%Tretā%} age I shall take
<div n="lb">birth as Rāma of {%Bhṛgu's%} race…; in the twilight
<div n="lb">{%(sandhyāṃśe)%} between {%Tretā%} and {%Dvāpara%} I shall take birth
<div n="lb">as {%Rāma Dāśarathi;%} at that time {%Ekata%} and {%Dvita%} (in
<div n="lb">consequence of their injury to {%Trita%}) will have to take
<div n="lb">birth as apes; all those apes shall become my allies…;
<div n="lb">in the period {%(sandhau)%} joining the {%Dvāpara%} and the {%Kali%}
<div n="lb">I shall take birth in {%Mathurā%} in order to slay {%Kaṃsa,%}
<div n="lb">and take up my residence in {%Kuśasthalī%} [at] {%Dvārakā;%}
<div n="lb">I shall transplant {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} to {%Dvārakā,%} and subjugate
<div n="lb">{%Maheśvara%} and {%Mahāsena%} (i.e. Skanda), who will help Dā.
<div n="lb">{%Bāṇa%} (with 1,000 arms);…{%Brahmán%} himself never
<div n="lb">obtained a sight of me in this shape of mine, which thou
<div n="lb">hast seen to-day.” {%Hari%} then disappeared; {%Nārada%} returned
<div n="lb">to {%Badarī,%} to behold {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa.%} This great
<div n="lb">{%Upaniṣad,%} consistent with the four {%Vedas%} and with
<div n="lb">{%Sāṅkhya-Yoga,%} and called {%Pāñcarātra,%} and recited by
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} himself, was repeated by {%Nārada%} in the abode
<div n="lb">of {%Brahmán. Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked: “Was not {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">acquainted with this wonderful narrative of the glory of
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} ?” {%Bhīṣma%} said that it was only to Ṛ. in the
<div n="lb">abode of {%Brahmán%} that {%Nārada%} recited his narrative. The
<div n="lb">propagation of the narrative; Ṛ. > {%Sūrya%} > 66,000 Ṛ. in
<div n="lb">{%Sūrya's%} train, etc., > D. on {%Meru > Asita >%} the {%Pitṛs;%}
<div n="lb">“I heard it from my father {%Śāntanu;%} it is a {%Purāṇa,%} and
<div n="lb">should not be communicated to anyone that is not
[Page513-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">a worshipper of {%Vāsudeva;%} it is really the essence of the
<div n="lb">hundreds of other narratives thou hast heard from me;
<div n="lb">in days of yore, D. and As., uniting together, churned
<div n="lb">the ocean for the {%amṛta;%} after the same manner, the
<div n="lb">brahmans in days of yore, uniting together, churned all
<div n="lb">the scriptures and raised this narrative.” He who reads this
<div n="lb">becomes an inhabitant of {%Śvetadvīpa,%} etc.—{%Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">said: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and all his brothers became devoted to
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa; Vyāsa%} visited (through the sky) the ocean of
<div n="lb">milk (which is always the abode of nectar), and worshipping
<div n="lb">the great God there, he came back to his own hermitage.—
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} said: “I have now repeated the narrative that
<div n="lb">was recited to {%Nārada;%} that narrative has descended from
<div n="lb">person to person from very ancient times; I heard it from
<div n="lb">my father.”—{%Sūta%} said: “I have now told you all that
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} recited to {%Janamejaya.%} King {%Janamejaya%}
<div n="lb">properly discharged all his duties according to the scriptures.
<div n="lb">You have all undergone severe penances, etc.; residing in

<div n="lb">do ye all adore {%…Nārāyaṇa.%} I heard this excellent
<div n="lb">narrative, that has descended from generation to generation,
<div n="lb">from my father in former times” (XII, {@340@}).—{%Śaunaka%}
<div n="lb">asked about {%pravṛtti%} and {%nivṛtti,%} etc. {%Sauti%} recited the
<div n="lb">discourse of {%Vaiśampāyana%} to {%Janamejaya. Janamejaya%} said
<div n="lb">that the whole world with {%Brahmán,%} D., As., and men
<div n="lb">are deeply attached to acts; {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), have adopted
<div n="lb">the religion of {%pravṛtti. Vaiśampāyana%} said that this
<div n="lb">question related to a deep mystery, and that it required
<div n="lb">penances and acquaintance with the {%Purāṇas;%} he recited
<div n="lb">what M.-ṛ. {%Vyāsa%} said to his disciples {%Sumantu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(as he used to teach them the four {%Vedas%} and {%Mahābhārata%}
<div n="lb">as the fifth), on {%Meru%} (inhabited by Si. and Cā.); {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">had been gratified by his penances on the shore of the
<div n="lb">ocean of milk, and he had, with the eye of knowledge,

<div n="lb">the eight {%Prakṛtis,%} upon whom all the worlds depend;

<div n="lb">eleven {%Rudras = Vikārapuruṣāḥ…Brahmán%} with the
<div n="lb">R., {%Prakṛtis,%} and D.-ṛ. repaired to the northern shore of
<div n="lb">the ocean of milk and practised the penances named
<div n="lb">{%mahāniyama%} (declared by {%Brahmán%} in the {%Vedas%}) for 1,000
<div n="lb">celestial years (description); then {%Hari%} spoke to them,
<div n="lb">saying that he would invest them with {%pravṛtti.%} They
<div n="lb">performed a sacrifice in honour of {%Viṣṇu%} according to the
<div n="lb">ordinances laid down for the {%Kṛta%} age. The great god
<div n="lb">was pleased and said that their {%pravṛtti%} should be fraught
<div n="lb">with ends whence there will be return; “{%Marīci,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">the seven Ṛ. who are {%mānasāḥ%} (spiritual sons of {%Brahmán%})

<div n="lb">spiritual {%(mānasāḥ)%} sons of {%Brahmán,%} and whose knowledge
<div n="lb">comes to them of itself, are wedded to the religion of
<div n="lb">{%nivṛtti,%} conversant with {%Yoga%} and {%Sāṅkhya,%} and cause the
<div n="lb">religion of {%nivṛtti%} to flow in the worlds. {%Kṣetrajña%} is
<div n="lb">myself…{%Brahmán's%} son {%Rudra%} has sprung from his brow
<div n="lb">at his command…In the {%Kṛta-yuga%} living creatures
[Page513-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">should not be slain in the sacrifices; in the {%Tretā-yuga%}
<div n="lb">animals, dedicated with {%mantras,%} will be slain in the sacrifices;
<div n="lb">then comes the mixed {%(miśraḥ) yuga Dvāpara;%} then {%Tiṣya%}
<div n="lb">with {%Kali%} in the van.” {%Vyāsa%} continued: D. and Ṛ. went
<div n="lb">away. Only {%Brahmán%} remained, desirous of beholding the
<div n="lb">great god, then residing in the form of {%Amruddha;%} the
<div n="lb">god then showed himself to {%Brahmán%} with a vast equine
<div n="lb">head, etc. (description), saying that at times he would
<div n="lb">appear in incarnate forms. Then he disappeared, and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} proceeded to his own region. “Do you bow to
<div n="lb">him who is the lord of the {%Rudras,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).” Blessing
<div n="lb">upon the reader (XII, {@341@}). {%Janamejaya%} inquired of the
<div n="lb">meaning of the different names of {%Nārāyaṇa; Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">related what {%Keśava%} (Kṛṣṇa) had said to {%Phālguna%} (Arjuna),
<div n="lb">when the latter asked him about the signification of his
<div n="lb">names mentioned by M.-ṛ. in the {%Vedas%} and the {%Purāṇas.%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} said: In the {%Ṛgveda,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), many are the names
<div n="lb">that have been mentioned by M.-ṛ.; “from {%Nārāyaṇa's%} [as
<div n="lb">{%Aniruddha%}] grace has arisen {%Brahmán,%} and from his wrath
<div n="lb">has arisen {%Rudra%}”; description of {%Rudra%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “I adored in
<div n="lb">days of yore the ancient {%Rudra%} for obtaining the boon of
<div n="lb">a son; {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), adore {%Hari Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu).%}”
<div n="lb">Etymology of {%Nārāyaṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); “Ṛ {%Trita,%} the eldest
<div n="lb">{%(ādyaḥ)%} son of {%Brahmán,%} when thrown into a well by
<div n="lb">{%Ekata%} and {%Dvita,%} invoked me as {%Pṛśnigarbha%} and was
<div n="lb">rescued from the pit; {%Dīrghatamas%} (§ 170) invoked me as
<div n="lb">{%Keśava,%} became cured of his blindness, and then came to
<div n="lb">be called {%Gotama%} (v. Nīl.); {%Agni%} and {%Soma,%} blending
<div n="lb">together, became transfused in one and the same substance
<div n="lb">{%(ekayonitvam āgataḥ)…,%} in the {%Purāṇa%} this is said,
<div n="lb">and further that the gods have {%Agni%} for their mouth”
<div n="lb">(XII, {@342@}). Asked by {%Arjuna%} about the unity of nature
<div n="lb">of {%Agni%} and {%Soma, Kṛṣṇa%} related this ancient story: I)
<div n="lb">When only the infinite water (quotation of the {%śruti%}) exists
<div n="lb">(called {%tamas%}), {%Bráhman > Puruṣa > Brahmán,%} who caused
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} (the {%kṣatra%}) and {%Soma%} ({%bráhman,%} i.e. the {%brahmans%}) to
<div n="lb">spring from his own eyes (quotation of the {%śruti%} relating
<div n="lb">to {%Agni%}); {%Agni%} is the {%hotṛ%} and the {%brahmán%} of the sacrifice;
<div n="lb">he who offers food in the mouth of a {%brahman%} is said to
<div n="lb">pour libations into the sacred fire for gratifying the deities
<div n="lb">(quotation from Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa); in this way {%brahmans%}
<div n="lb">have come to be regarded as {%Agni. Agni%} is again {%Viṣṇu%}
<div n="lb">(quoting {%Sanatkumāra%}).—II) By {%Gautama's%} curse (for his
<div n="lb">assault on {%Ahalyā%}), {%Indra%} got a green beard; through the
<div n="lb">curse of {%Kauśika, Indra%} lost his testicles and got those of
<div n="lb">a ram.—III) As {%Indra%} with uplifted thunderbolt would
<div n="lb">prevent the {%Aśvins%} from receiving a share in sacrifice
<div n="lb">{%(graha-), Cyavana%} paralysed his arms.—IV) Incensed at the
<div n="lb">destruction of his sacrifice, {%Dakṣa%} by his austerities caused
<div n="lb">a third eye to appear on the forehead of {%Rudra.%}—V) When
<div n="lb">{%Rudra%} would destroy {%Tripura, Uśanas%} tore a matted lock
<div n="lb">from his head and hurled it at {%Rudra,%} whence serpents
<div n="lb">began to bite {%Rudra,%} whose throat became blue, just as in
<div n="lb">the {%Svāyambhuva Manvantara,%} when {%Nārāyaṇa%} seized {%Rudra%}
<div n="lb">by the throat.—VI) When {%Aṅgiras Bṛhaspati%} sat [on the
<div n="lb">shores of the ocean] to make preparation for the churning in
<div n="lb">order to raise the {%amṛta%} and touched water {%(upaspṛśataḥ),%} the
<div n="lb">water was not clear {%(na prasādaṃ gatavatyaḥ);%} he became
<div n="lb">angry and [cursed] the ocean, saying: “From this day thou
<div n="lb">shalt be tainted with fishes, etc.”—VII) {%Viśvarūpa Triśiras%}
<div n="lb">{%Tvāṣṭra%} was the {%purohita%} of the gods; he was the sister-son
<div n="lb">of the {%Asuras;%} while publicly offering to the deities he
<div n="lb">secretly offered shares to the {%Asuras;%} the {%Asuras%} with
[Page514-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Hiraṇyakaśipu%} at their head prevailed upon him through
<div n="lb">his mother, that he (who had come to the {%Nandana%} wood)
<div n="lb">should aid {%Hiraṇyakaśipu,%} who was cursed by {%Hairaṇyagarbha%}
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha,%} saying: “Since thou hast chosen another {%hotṛ,%}
<div n="lb">thy sacrifice shall not be completed, and thou shalt be slain
<div n="lb">by a hitherto unknown kind of being.” {%Viśvarūpa%} performed
<div n="lb">austere {%tapas; Indra%} sent {%Apsarases,%} of whom {%Viśvarūpa%}
<div n="lb">became enamoured, and he promised to destroy {%Indra%} and
<div n="lb">the gods; he uttered {%mantras%} by which he grew; with one
<div n="lb">mouth he drank all the {%soma%} that was offered to the gods by
<div n="lb">the brahmans in all the worlds; with one [he ate] food; with
<div n="lb">one [he drank the energy of all] the gods, including {%Indra.%}
<div n="lb">These repaired to {%Brahmán%} (so B.; {%Brāhmaṇaṃ,%} C.), and
<div n="lb">according to his counsel they prevailed upon Ṛ. {%Bhārgava%}
<div n="lb">{%Dadhīca,%} that he should abandon his body by his {%yoga%} power;
<div n="lb">his bones {%Dhātṛ%} shaped into a thunderbolt {%(vajra),%} which was
<div n="lb">pervaded by the energy of {%Viṣṇu;%} with this {%vajra Indra%}
<div n="lb">struck {%Viśvarūpa,%} and severed the heads from the body. By
<div n="lb">the pressing {%(mathana)%} of his limbs {%Vṛtra%} came into existence,
<div n="lb">whom {%Indra%} slew. Terrified with the double brahmanicide,
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} abandoned the sovereignty of the gods; he entered
<div n="lb">a cool lotus-stalk in the {%Mānasa%} lake, and becoming very
<div n="lb">minute {%(aṇumātraḥ)%} by his {%yoga%} power {%(aiśvarya-yogāt)%} he
<div n="lb">entered the fibres of that lotus-stalk. Now {%rajas%} and {%tamas%}
<div n="lb">assailed the deities; the {%mantras%} of M.-ṛ. lost their efficacy
<div n="lb">{%(na prāvartanta),%} Rā. appeared; the {%Vedas (Brahma)%} were
<div n="lb">about to disappear {%(utsādanaṃ jagāma);%} without an {%Indra,%}
<div n="lb">the worlds lost their strength and became easy to overwhelm.
<div n="lb">Then the gods and {%Ṛṣis%} crowned {%Āyus'%} son {%Nahuṣa%} as king
<div n="lb">of the gods. {%Nahuṣa%} ruled over heaven with 500 luminaries
<div n="lb">on his forehead, which had the virtue of robbing the energy
<div n="lb">of every creature. Then follows, somewhat abbreviated, the
<div n="lb">contents of § 555 (Indra) = V, {@11@} foll.—VIII) In days of yore,
<div n="lb">when M.-ṛ. {%Bharadvāja%} was saying his prayers {%(upāspṛśat)%}
<div n="lb">on the shore of the celestial {%Gaṅgā,%} he was approached by
<div n="lb">{%Viṣṇu,%} who was taking his three strides; {%Viṣṇu,%} struck
<div n="lb">with water by {%Bharadvāja%} on the breast, received a mark
<div n="lb">[i.e. Śrīvatsa] on his breast.—IX) Cursed by M.-ṛ. {%Bhṛgu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} was obliged to become a devourer of all things.—
<div n="lb">X) {%Aditi%} cooked food for the gods to strengthen them so
<div n="lb">that they might slay the {%Asuras;%} there {%Budha%} [i.e. the
<div n="lb">planet Mercury], after completing a vow {%(vratacaryā-),%} came
<div n="lb">and asked for alms of {%Aditi;%} but she, intending that only
<div n="lb">the gods should eat it first, gave him no alms. At this
<div n="lb">{%Budha (Brahmabhūtaḥ)%} cursed {%Aditi,%} saying that she would
<div n="lb">have a pain {%(vyathā)%} in her womb; in the second birth
<div n="lb">(as an egg) of {%Vivasvat,%} the egg of [his] mother {%Aditi%} [was]
<div n="lb">killed (so B.); [therefore] {%Vivasvat Śrāddhadeva%} [became]
<div n="lb">{%Mārttaṇḍa.%}—XI) {%Dakṣa%} had sixty daughters, of whom he
<div n="lb">gave thirteen to {%Kaśyapa,%} ten to {%Dharma,%} ten to {%Manu,%} and
<div n="lb">twenty-seven (the {%Nakṣatras%}) to {%Soma;%}; although the latter
<div n="lb">were all alike in respect of beauty, etc., yet {%Soma%} became more
<div n="lb">attached to {%Rohiṇī,%} and was cursed by {%Dakṣa,%} etc., cf. § 615
<div n="lb">(Prabhāsotpattikathana) = IX, {@35;@} {%Prabhāsa%} in the western
<div n="lb">ocean was originally called {%Hiraṇyasaras;%} from this curse
<div n="lb">also have come the dark spots in the disc of the moon,
<div n="lb">exhibiting the mark of a hare.—XII) M.-ṛ. {%Sthūlaśiras%}
<div n="lb">practised austerities on the north-eastern side of {%Meru;%}
<div n="lb">a breeze, charged with all delicious perfumes, gratifled him;
<div n="lb">the trees around him [from jealousy] put forth their flowers
<div n="lb">to make a display; he cursed them, saying that they should
<div n="lb">not have flowers at all times.—XIII) {%Nārāyaṇa,%} in days of
<div n="lb">yore, for the good of the world, became M.-ṛ. {%Vaḍavāmukha;%}
[Page514-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">practising austerities on {%Meru,%} he summoned the ocean;
<div n="lb">but it did not come; he then, with the heat of his body,
<div n="lb">evaporated its water and caused it to become as saltish in taste
<div n="lb">as the human sweat; it should cease to be drinkable; only
<div n="lb">to {%Vaḍavāmukha%} it should be sweet, when he drinks it;
<div n="lb">therefore, to this day, the water from the ocean is drunk
<div n="lb">only by {%Vaḍavāmukha,%} who lives within it {%(anuvartinā).%}—
<div n="lb">XIV) {%Umā,%} the daughter of the mountain {%Himavat,%} was
<div n="lb">desired in marriage by {%Rudra;%} M.-ṛ. {%Bhṛgu,%} was refused,
<div n="lb">and therefore he brought about that {%Himavat%} ceased to abound
<div n="lb">with jewels and gems. Even such is the glory of the brahman.
<div n="lb">[Almost the whole of the preceding part of this chapter is
<div n="lb">in prose.]—Etymologies of {%Hṛṣīkeśa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); Ṛ. {%Yāska,%}

<div n="lb">{%Śrīkaṇṭha%} from the mark of {%Nārāyaṇa's%} hand on his throat.—
<div n="lb">The two Ṛ. {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} then made friends with

<div n="lb">those foes whom thou hast slain, were all, in the first instance,
<div n="lb">slain by him” (XII, {@343@}). {%Śaunaka%} asked, why {%Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">having seen the Supreme Lord in the form of {%Aniruddha,%}
<div n="lb">again proceeded so quickly to {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa. Sauti%}
<div n="lb">said: At an interval in his snake-sacrifice, {%Janamejaya%}
<div n="lb">addressed his great-grandfather {%Vyāsa,%} asking him this
<div n="lb">same question, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vaiśampāyana%} answered: Leaving
<div n="lb">{%Śvetadvīpa, Nārada%} quickly proceeded to {%Meru,%} full of
<div n="lb">wonder, thence to {%Gandhamādana,%} and, traversing the sky,
<div n="lb">to {%Badarī,%} where he saw the Ṛ. [{%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}],
<div n="lb">engaged in penances, both with {%Śrīvatsa%} and matted locks,
<div n="lb">both with “the swan's foot” on their palms, etc., each of
<div n="lb">them with four {%muṣkas.%} (v. the note of PCR., p. 822),
<div n="lb">sixty teeth, and four arms, etc. (description), and told them
<div n="lb">what he had seen at {%Śvetadvīpa,%} and that the marks of
<div n="lb">{%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} were the same that he had seen on
<div n="lb">the Supreme Soul; “that realm, where he resides, the
<div n="lb">Sun warms not, etc.; having constructed an altar, measuring
<div n="lb">eight fingers' breadth, he is practising penances there,
<div n="lb">standing on one foot, etc.; whatever libations…are
<div n="lb">poured on the sacrificial fire by Ṛ., etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), all reach the
<div n="lb">feet of that great deity” (XII, {@344@}). Discourse of {%Nara%}
<div n="lb">and {%Nārāyana%} to {%Nārada%} about {%Nārāyaṇa;%} “{%Sūrya%} is said
<div n="lb">to be the door [through which the emancipate must pass];
<div n="lb">entering {%Sūrya,%} their bodies are consumed by his fire; they
<div n="lb">then become invisible…; reduced to invisible atoms

[Page515-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">by us in {%Śvetadvīpa.%}” D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%} became entirely devoted
<div n="lb">to {%Nārāyaṇa,%} and dwelt in {%Badarī%} for 1,000 celestial years
<div n="lb">(XII, {@345@}). {%Vaiśampāyana%} related the discourse between
<div n="lb">{%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} on one side and {%Nārada%} on the other
<div n="lb">about the rites in honour of the {%Pitṛs. Nārada,%} the son
<div n="lb">of {%Dakṣa,%} was originally the son of {%Brahmán,%} created before
<div n="lb">all others by a fiat of his will. On one occasion the deities
<div n="lb">taught their children [the {%Pitṛs%}] the {%śrutis,%} and, having
<div n="lb">lost their knowledge, had to acquire it again from those
<div n="lb">sons (v. the note of PCR., p. 829); the gods and the {%Pitṛs,%}
<div n="lb">placing three {%piṇḍas%} on some blades of {%kuśa-%}grass, worshipped
<div n="lb">each other. Then {%Nārada%} asked why the {%Pitṛs%} in days of
<div n="lb">yore acquired the name of {%piṇḍas. Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">said: The earth, in days of yore, disappeared, and was
<div n="lb">raised up by {%Govinda (Vṛṣākapi)%} in the shape of a gigantic
<div n="lb">boar; when the hour came for his morning prayers, he,
<div n="lb">suddenly shaking off three balls of mud from his tusk,
<div n="lb">placed them upon the earth and dedicated them to his
<div n="lb">own self, saying that he was resolved to create those that
<div n="lb">were to be called {%Pitṛs;%} seeing that the three balls of mud
<div n="lb">had fallen towards the south, he declared that these should
<div n="lb">be known henceforth by the name of {%Pitṛs.%} Having then
<div n="lb">offered those {%piṇḍas%} on the {%Vārāha%} mountain, worshipping
<div n="lb">his own self, he disappeared. Therefore those who sacrifice
<div n="lb">to the {%Pitṛs,%} etc., sacrifice, etc., to {%Viṣṇu%} himself (XII, {@346@}).
<div n="lb">{%Vaiśampāyana%} continued: D.-ṛ. {%Nārada,%} after 1,000 years,
<div n="lb">repaired to his own retreat on {%Himavat,%} while {%Nara%} and
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} remained in {%Badarī,%} engaged in austerities; “the
<div n="lb">ancestors of that person who hates {%Nārāyaṇa,%} sink into hell
<div n="lb">for ever”; glorification of {%Nārāyaṇa,%} citing {%Vyāsa%} and referring
<div n="lb">to {%Harigītā%} (i.e. Bhagavadgītā); “{%Vyāsa%} is {%Nārāyaṇa%} on
<div n="lb">earth; who else could compile such a treatise as the
<div n="lb">{%Mahābhārata%} ? Having listened to the diverse kinds of duties
<div n="lb">and resolved upon a horse-sacrifice, let thy great sacrifice
<div n="lb">go on.” {%—Sauti%} continued: Formerly {%Nārada%} had recited the
<div n="lb">discourse about {%Nārāyaṇa%} to my preceptor in the hearing
<div n="lb">of many Ṛ. and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Bhīṣma.%}
<div n="lb">{%Sauti's%} eulogium on {%Nārāyaṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XII, {@347@}). {%Śaunaka%}
<div n="lb">said: “I have heard from thee the glory of the Supreme
<div n="lb">Soul, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the form of {%Viṣṇu%} with the equine head,
<div n="lb">that appeared in the great ocean on the north-east was
<div n="lb">beheld by {%Brahmán Parameṣṭhin.%}” {%Śaunaka%} then inquired
<div n="lb">why {%Hari%} had appeared, in the form of {%Aniruddha%} with the
<div n="lb">horse-head, to {%Brahmán. Sauti%} said he would recite that
<div n="lb">which {%Vaiśampāyana%} recited to {%Janamejaya%} (in the Snake-
<div n="lb">sacrifice), who put the same question to {%Vaiśampāyana.%}
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} put the question to {%Vaiśampāyana. Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">expounded how the destruction is brought about of all
<div n="lb">things; then “from the primeval darkness (fraught with
<div n="lb">immortality) arises {%Bráhman > Puruṣa = Aniruddha =%}
<div n="lb">{%Pradhāna%} (divested of sex) = {%Avyakta = Viśvaksena Hari,%}
<div n="lb">who, yielding to {%yoga-%}sleep {%(nidrāyogaṃ),%} lays himself down
<div n="lb">on the waters thinking of the creation; > {%Ahaṅkāra =%}
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán,%} etc. = {%Hiraṇyagarbha,%} who takes birth within the
<div n="lb">lotus [that springs] from {%Aniruddha.%} Adopting the attribute
<div n="lb">of {%sattva (sattvasthaḥ), Brahmán%} commenced to create the
<div n="lb">universe. In the primeval lotus two drops of water had
<div n="lb">been deposited by {%Nārāyaṇa:%} one like honey {%(madhu)%} which
<div n="lb">became {%Madhu%} made up of {%tamas;%} the other hard {%(kaṭhina)%}
<div n="lb">which became {%Kaiṭabha%} made up of {%rajas;%} these two {%Asuras%}
<div n="lb">{%(Dānavas),%} armed with maces, beheld within the lotus
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} creating the four {%Vedas,%} seized them, and dived
<div n="lb">to {%Rasā[-tala]%} in the north-eastern ocean.” {%Brahmán%}
[Page515-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">complained before {%Īśāna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then he hymned {%Hari%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>):
<div n="lb">“my first birth from thee was due to a fiat of thy will;
<div n="lb">my second birth in days of yore was from thy eyes; my
<div n="lb">third birth was from thy speech; my fourth birth was from
<div n="lb">thy ears; my fifth birth was from thy nose; my sixth birth
<div n="lb">was from an egg; this is my seventh birth, in this lotus.”
<div n="lb">{%Puruṣa%} rose from his slumber and assumed an equine head,
<div n="lb">he who was the abode of the {%Vedas;%} the firmament became
<div n="lb">the crown of his head, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); then he disappeared and
<div n="lb">proceeded to {%Rasā[-tala];%} there he set himself to {%yoga,%}
<div n="lb">and adopting a voice according to the {%śikṣā%} he began to
<div n="lb">loudly utter Vedic mantras. The two {%Asuras,%} making an
<div n="lb">appointment with the {%Vedas%} as to the time of their return,
<div n="lb">threw them down to {%Rasātala%} and ran after the sound.
<div n="lb">Meanwhile {%Hari%} took up all the {%Vedas%} and gave them
<div n="lb">to {%Brahmán;%} he placed the horse-head in the north-
<div n="lb">eastern ocean, [which horse-head], moreover, [was] the abode
<div n="lb">{%(ālayaṃ)%} of the {%Vedas,%} and thence he was called {%(babhūta)%}
<div n="lb">{%Aśvaśivas%} (“horse-headed”). Returning to the lotus, {%Madhu%}
<div n="lb">and {%Kaiṭabha%} saw him in the form of {%Aniruddha%} in {%yoga-%}
<div n="lb">sleep on the water, white, endued with stainless {%sattva,%} on
<div n="lb">the hood of a snake surrounded with a garland of flames.
<div n="lb">They awakened him and were slain by him; thence he came
<div n="lb">to be called {%Madhusūdana.%} Aided then by {%Hari%} and assisted
<div n="lb">by the {%Vedas, Brahmán%} created all the worlds. Then {%Hari%}
<div n="lb">disappeared. Once more, however, he assumed the same form
<div n="lb">for the sake of the religion of {%pravṛtti%} ({%pravṛttidharmārthaṃ%}
<div n="lb">B.; C. {%°ttiṃdha°%}). The brahman who frequently {%(nityaṃ)%} hears
<div n="lb">or mentally recites {%(dhārayīta)%} this story, will never forget his
<div n="lb">[Vedic or other] lore. Having adored with austere penances
<div n="lb">the god with the equine head, Ṛ. {%Pañcala%} [i.e. {%Gālava,%} PCR.]
<div n="lb">acquired [the science of] {%Krama%} proceeding along the path
<div n="lb">pointed out by the deity [i.e. {%Rudra,%} PCR.; cf. XII, {@343,@}
<div n="lb">13261—63]. {%Hari%} is the receptacle {%(nidhiḥ)%} of the {%Vedas,%} and
<div n="lb">of penances, and {%yoga,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%ṛta,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), has {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">for its soul; the Supreme Being is the cause of all this as
<div n="lb">{%Puruṣa%} and as {%Pradhāna;%} he is the agent, etc.; the thoughts
<div n="lb">of-all, including {%Brahmán,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), are known to {%Keśava;%}
<div n="lb">but none of these can know what his thoughts are, etc.;
<div n="lb">he is called {%Vāsudeva%} because of his being the abode of all
<div n="lb">creatures; he is the eternal highest M.-ṛ., etc.; only the M. ṛ.
<div n="lb">that have knowledge for their souls behold the eternal
<div n="lb">{%Puruṣa%} who transcends all attributes {%(guṇādhikaṃ)%} (XII,
<div n="lb">{@348@}). {%Janamejaya%} said that the {%ekāntins%} [i.e. those who
<div n="lb">are devoted to {%Nārāyaṇa%} with their whole souls] at once
<div n="lb">attain to the fourth or highest end (i.e. {%Puruṣottama%})
<div n="lb">without going through the three [i.e. {%Aniruddha, Pradyumna,%}
<div n="lb">and {%Saṅkarṣaṇa;%} PCR.], and this end is better than that
<div n="lb">attained to by brahmans studying the {%Vedas%} with the
<div n="lb">{%Upaniṣads,%} etc., and by {%Yatis;%} and he asked who first
<div n="lb">promulgated the religion of Devotion.—{%Vaiśampāyana%} said:
<div n="lb">When the {%Pāṇḍava%} and the {%Kuru%} armies were drawn up
<div n="lb">in array for the battle, and {%Arjuna%} became cheerless, {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">himself explained this religion [sc. in the Bhagavadgītā].
<div n="lb">Having created this religion in the {%Kṛta%} age it is borne
<div n="lb">by {%Nārāyaṇa%} himself. {%Nārada%} was questioned about it by
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} in the midst of Ṛ. and in the presence of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Bhīṣma.%} My preceptor {%Vyāsa%} heard what D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%}
<div n="lb">said, and imparted it to me.—I) In that {%Kalpa,%} when
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} took his birth in (A) the mind of {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%(mānasaṃ janma)%} and issued from the latter's mouth,
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} himself performed the rites of this religion.
<div n="lb">From him it passed to Ṛ. {%Phenapaḥ%} (froth-drinking)

<div n="lb">The religion of the {%Yatis%} has been narrated to thee in the

<div n="lb">asked why all persons do not follow the religion of Devotion.

<div n="lb">recapitulating {%(āvartayan)%} the {%Vedas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); asked by us,
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} related: This narrative, belonging to the early times

<div n="lb">{%(prajāvisarge vai saptame padmasambhave), Brahmán%} being
<div n="lb">hesitating on account of the difficulty of creating, {%Nārāyaṇa%}
<div n="lb">caused Intelligence {%(Buddhi)%} to enter {%Brahmán,%} who now
<div n="lb">created Dai., Dā., G., and Rā., etc.; seeing that many of these
