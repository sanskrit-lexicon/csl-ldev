<div n="lb">220 bis (in Nārada's enumeration of departed kings).—§ 134
<div n="lb">(cf. Śakuntalop.): {%V.%} had deprived Vasiṣṭha of his children;
<div n="lb">though born as a kṣatriya he became a brahman through his
<div n="lb">penances, and created the river {%Kauśikī%} for his ablutions;
<div n="lb">there, his wife, during a famine, was maintained by the
<div n="lb">{%rājarṣi Mataṅga,%} who was living as a hunter; therefore,
<div n="lb">when the famine was over, {%V.%} changed the name of the river
<div n="lb">into {%Pārā%} and performed a sacrifice for {%Mataṅga,%} and {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">himself, from fear, came there to drink {%soma. V.,%} in anger,
<div n="lb">created another world and a series of nakṣatras, beginning
