[{@Brāhmaṇagītā@}]¦ (“the instruction given by the brahman”).
§ 782{%b%} (Anugītāparvan): {%Kṛṣṇa%} said: A certain brahman's
wife asked her husband (who was a complete master of every
kind of knowledge and wisdom) to what region she should
go, being dependent on him as her husband, who was harsh
in his conduct towards her ({%kīnāśaṃ%}, i.e. {%karkaśaṃ niranu-%}
{%krośaṃ%}, Nīl.). The brahman discourses on acts; on the seat
of the soul, where {%Bráhman, Soma%}, and {%Agni%}, etc., dwell,
and for whose sake {%Brahmán%}, etc., in {%Yoga%}, worship the
indestructible, etc.; the life-breaths {%prāṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>); in the
midst of them is {%Agni Vaiśvānara%}, whose seven flames are
the nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear, the mind,
and the understanding ({%boddhavyaṃ%}), etc. (XIV, {@20@}). In
this connection an ancient story is cited, viz. that of the
institution of the ten {%hotṛs%}, i.e. the ear, the skin, the two eyes,
[Page163-a+ 63]
the tongue, the nose, the two feet, the two hands, the genital
organ, the lower duct, and speech; sound, etc., are the ten
libations; the points of the compass, wind, sun, moon, earth,
fire, {%Viṣṇu, Indra, Prajāpati%}, and {%Mitra%} are the ten fires,
etc. (XIV, {@21@}); in this connection an ancient story is cited,
viz. that of the institution of the seven {%hotṛs%}, the nose, the eye,
the tongue, the skin, the ear, the mind, and the understanding
({%buddhiḥ%}), not knowing the qualities of one another; the
nose, etc., and the understanding never succeed in appre-
hending doubt, it is the mind [alone] that apprehends it;
the nose, etc., and the mind never succeed in apprehending
determination; it is the understanding alone that apprehends
it; in this connection this ancient narrative of a discourse
between the senses and the mind is cited: as the nose does
not smell, etc., without the mind, the mind thought itself to
be the eternal and foremost one of all the elements; but the
senses said that without them the mind would have no enjoy-
ments at all, etc. (XIV, {@22@}); likewise the ancient story of
the institution of the five {%hotṛs: Prāṇa, Apāna, Udāna%},
{%Samāna%}, and {%Vyāna%}; the wind nursed by {%Prāṇa > Apāna >%}
{%Vyāna > Udāna > Samāna%}; these asked {%Brahmán%} in days of
yore as to which of them was the foremost; {%Brahmán%} said
that he upon whose extinction all the life-breaths become
extinct is the foremost; it turned out (as {%Brahmán%} said)
that they are all foremost and not foremost, as they possess
the attributes of one another (XIV, {@23@}); likewise the
ancient story of the discourse between {%Nāraca%} and Ṛ.
{%Devamata. Devamata%} said: Which part of a creature that
takes birth comes first into existence, is it {%Prāṇa%} or {%Āpāna%},
etc.? {%Nārada%} seems to give the following explanation:
{%kāma%} (desire) is (1—2) {%samāna%} and {%vyāna%}, which move trans-
versely and alternately [from the man to the woman, and
{%vice versa?%}] and have sprung from {%sattva%}; from {%kāma%} springs
the vital seed [in the man] and the {%rajas%} or blood [in the
woman]; from the union of these two springs (3) {%prāṇa%}, and
from the seed being modified by {%prāṇa%} springs (4) {%apāna%};
these two move up and down and represent the two libations
in the [mystical] fire; from the sexual intercourse of the loving
pair springs {%harṣa%} (pleasure), which is (5) {%udāna%} = the fire
between {%prāṇa%} and {%apāna%} = the fire between day and night
= the fire between {%sat%} (the existent) and {%asat%} (the non-
existent) = [the union between {%Samāna%} and (Nīl.)] {%Vyāna%}
{%= Śānti%} (tranquillity) = eternal {%Bráhman%} (“as the brahmans
know”); in fire the smoke is {%tamas%} (darkness), and the ashes
{%rajas%} (passion). [Nīl. takes all the expressions figuratively
in a philosophical sense; according to him the seed ({%śukra%})
is = {%adṛṣṭa%}, i.e. the {%karman%} of past lives, the blood ({%śoṇitaṃ%})
= attachment to the objects of sense, {%prāṇa = liṅgātman%},
{%apāna%} = death, etc.] (XIV, {@24@}); likewise the ancient story
of the {%Cāturhotra%}, i.e. the sacrifice with four {%hotṛs%}; the
instrument, the action, the agent, and emancipation; at the
sacrifice of {%yoga%} the {%Prāṇa%} is the {%Stotra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); people
knowing {%Nārāyaṇa%} recite some Ṛcs; to {%Nārāyaṇa%} animals
(i.e. the senses, Nīl.) were offered in days of yore; and some
{%Sāmans; Nārāyaṇa%} is the soul of all (XIV, {@25@}); †there
is one ruler, residing in the heart, etc.; instructed by him the
seven Ṛ.'s shine in the firmament; having lived with that
instructor. {%Indra%} attained to the sovereignty of all the worlds.
There is one enemy, residing in the heart; instructed by him
all snakes are always hated (†v. 746—750). In this con-
nection the old story of the instruction of the snakes, the gods
(and As.), and Ṛ. by {%Prajāpati%} is cited; asked by them what
is highly beneficial, he said {%om%}, i.e. {%Bráhman%} in one syllable;
[Page163-b+ 63]
then they ran away in various directions from desire of self-
instruction; first arose in the snakes the disposition of biting;
in the As. the disposition for ostentatious pride; the gods
betook themselves to gifts, and M.-ṛ. to self-restraint (XIV,
{@26@}). The brahman compared the world to an impassable
fastness ({%durgaṃ%}), and {%Bráhman%} to a great forest; asked by
his wife, he described this forest copiously (XIV, {@27@}); “it
is not I, but nature that smells scents, etc.” In this con-
nection an ancient discourse between an {%adhvaryu%} and a {%yati%}
is recited: Beholding an animal sprinkled with water at
a sacrificial ceremony, a {%yati%} blamed the {%adhvaryu%} for that
destruction of life. The {%Adhvaryu%} appealed to the {%Vedas%},
saying, “This goat will not be destroyed, but will be
benefited; that part of it which is of earth will go to earth,”
etc.; the {%yati%} said that if the sacrifice was to the benefit of the
goat, then the goats ought to give their consent; “abstention
from cruelty is alone worthy of approbation; one should be
guided by perception”; the {%adhvaryu%} objected that by
smelling what belongs to the earth, etc., one takes life, as
all these entities have life; the {%yati%} distinguished between the
indestructible and the destructible of the soul ({%ātmanaḥ%}); of
these only the indestructible is really existent; to him who is
freed from all existent objects there is no fear; the {%adhvaryu%}
admires and praises him, and says that he has no fault by
performing those rites according to the {%mantras%}; the {%yati%}
remained silent; the {%adhvaryu%} proceeded with the sacrifice
(XIV, {@28@}). Follows the ancient story about the 1,000-armed
king {%Kārtavīryārjuna%} and the Ocean; v. {%Arjuna Kārtavīrya%}
({%c%}) and {%Paraśu-Rāma (d%}) (XIV, {@29@}) with {%Alarka (e%}) (XIV,
{@30@}). The brahman said: There are three foes in the world
(i.e. ninefold, on account of the three guṇas); exultation,
satisfaction, and joy 〈 goodness; desire, wrath, and hatred 〈 
passion; lassitude, sloth, and delusion 〈 darkness. Persons
conversant with the ancient {%kalpas%} recite some verses which
were sung in days of old by king {%Ambarīṣa%}, who had
acquired a tranquil soul: “I have killed all foes, etc., but
the greatest vice has not yet been destroyed by me…”
(XIV, {@31@}). Then the old narrative of the discourse between
a brahman and king {%Janaka(f%}) is cited (XIV, {@32—33@}).
Asked by his wife as to how this knowledge may be acquired,
the brahman said: Know that {%Brāhmaṇī%} (i.e. {%buddhi%}, Nīl.) is
the [lower] {%araṇī%}, the preceptor the upper {%araṇī%}; penances
and conversance with the scriptures turn the upper {%araṇī%};
knowledge is the fire produced. Asked by his wife about the
symbol ({%liṅgaṃ%}) of {%Bráhman%} called {%kṣetrajña%}, the brahman
answered that he is without symbols and qualities. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
said: Then the mind of that brahman's wife, upon the
destruction of the {%kṣetrajña%}, became that which is beyond
the {%kṣetrajñas%}, in consequence of the knowledge of {%kṣetra%}.
Asked by {%Arjuna%}, where now that brahman and his wife
were, {%Kṛṣṇa%} said: “My mind ({%manas%}) is the brahman, my
understanding ({%buddhi%}) is the {%brāhmaṇī%}; he who has been
called {%kṣetrajña%} is I myself” (XIV. {@34@}).
