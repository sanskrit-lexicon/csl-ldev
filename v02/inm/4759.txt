[{@Jambūkhaṇḍavinirmāṇaparvan@}¦ ({%°va%})] (“the sec-
tion relating to the measurement of Jambūkhaṇḍa,” the 67th
of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. °vinirmāṇa). § 574:
{%Janamejaya%} inquired how the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
{%Somakas%} fought on {%Kurukṣetra. Vaiśampāyana%} began the
description of the battle. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} occupied the western
part, turned towards the east, beyond {%Samantapañcaka%}. The
force was collected from the whole of {%Jambudvīpa. Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} and {%Duryodhana%} fixed watchwords. Seeing {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} (description), the {%Pāñcālas%} were filled with joy, and
blew their conches, etc.; {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} also blew their
conches {%Devadatta%} and {%Pāñcajanya%}, at which the {%Kurus%} were
alarmed. Various ill omens were beheld. Both parties <is>settled</is>
<is>rules and made covenants</is> regarding the different kinds
of combat (VI, {@1@}). {%Vyāsa%} visited {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and offered to
grant him spiritual vision that he might witness the battle.
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} did not like to see the slaughter of his kinsmen.
{%Vyāsa%} then granted it to {%Sañjaya%}, that he might narrate
everything to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}; weapons would not hurt him;
he would come out of the battle with life. {%Vyāsa%} informed
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of the omens (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), and appealed to him for
peace; but {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} urged the disobedience of his sons.
{%Vyāsa%} enumerated to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} the omens that indicate
victory, and recommended negotiation, as victory was uncertain
(VI, {@2, 3@}). Then {%Vyāsa%} departed. Seeing the many hundreds
of millions of men that had come together at {%Kurujāṅgala%} to
lay down their very lives for the sake of the earth, {%Dhṛtarā-%}
{%ṣṭra%} inquired of {%Sañjaya%} after the attributes of Earth, and
the details about the countries and cities from which they
had come. {%Sañjaya%} discoursed on the merits of the earth,
and the various classes of creatures inhabiting it. Their
twenty-four constituents are described as {%Gāyatrī%} (VI, {@4@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} inquired about the rivers, mountains, and
provinces of the earth, and their dimensions. {%Sañjaya%} spoke
of the five elements and their attributes, earth being the
foremost. Then he began the <is>description</is> of the dvīpa of
{%Sudarśana%} (VI, {@5@}). {%Sañjaya%} discoursed on the six mountains
({%varṣaparvatāḥ%}, B.) that extend from the eastern to the
western ocean, and are the resort of Si. and Cā.: {%Himavat%};
etc. (<lang n="greek">β</lang>), and the {%varṣas%} between them—{%Bhārata-varṣa%}, etc.
(<lang n="greek">γ</lang>); {%Mālyavat, Gandhamādana; Meru%} (description); the four
islands beside {%Meru—Bhadrāśva%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>); the bird {%Sumukha%}
({%b%}); on {%Meru%} sport D., G., As., Rā., and Aps., and
{%Brahmán, Rudra%}, and {%Śakra%} perform sacrifices; {%Tumburu%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>), adore the gods with hymns; the seven {%Ṛṣis%} and
{%Kaśyapa%} repair thither on every {%parvan%}-day (i.e. the day of
full moon and that of new moon); upon the summit is {%Uśanas%}
with the {%Daityas%}; the jewels, etc., come from {%Meru%}, one-fourth
part being enjoyed by {%Kubera%}, who gives only one-sixteenth
to men. On the northern side of {%Meru%} is a forest of {%karṇi-%}
{%kāras%}; there {%Paśupati%} (the creator of all things), together with
his celestial attendants and {%Umā%}, sports, bearing a chain of
{%karṇikāra%} flowers reaching down to his feet, and his three
eyes resembling three suns; the {%Siddhas%} can behold him, but
not persons of wicked conduct; from the summit of that
mountain {%Gaṅgā (c%}) falls down. On the western side of
[Page350-a+ 63]
{%Meru%} is {%Ketumāla (d%}), and also {%Jambūkhaṇḍa, Gandhamādana%}
({%e%}). The last {%varṣa%} in the north and {%Bharata's varṣa%} in the
south are both of the form of a bow. Amongst these seven
{%varṣas%} that which is further north excels the one to its
immediate south in respect of longevity, stature, health,
righteousness, pleasure, and profit. The huge mountains of
{%Hemakūṭa%} are also called {%Kailāsa%}, where {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e.
Kubera) lives in joy with Gh. To the north of {%Kailāsa%} and
near the mountains of {%Maināka%} there is the huge and beautiful
mountain {%Hiraṇyaśṛṅga%}. Beside this the delightful lake
{%Bindusaras (f%}), with golden sands. Rā. reside on {%Himavat%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>). The two dvīpas {%Nāgadvīpa%} and {%Kaśyapadvīpa%} are
the two ears of this hare-shaped region; the beautiful
mountains of {%Malaya%}, having rocks like copper plates, form
another part of {%Jambūdvīpa%}, making it resemble a hare (VI,
{@6@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} about the regions to the
north and the east side of {%Meru%}, and about the mountains of
{%Mālyavat. Sañjaya%} told about the {%Uttarakurus (Uttarāḥ%}
{%Kuravaḥ) (g%}). East of {%Meru%} the foremost region is {%Bhadrāśva%}
({%h%}). The {%jambū%} tree ({%i). Mālyavat (j%}) (VI, {@7@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
inquired about the names of all the {%varṣas%} and mountains.
{%Sañjaya%} related of {%Ramaṇaka%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became
absorbed in meditation about his sons; then he said: “Time
destroys and creates everything; {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%},
omniscient, destroying all creatures ({%sarvabhūtahṛt%}), the
gods call him {%Vaikuṇṭha%}, men call him {%Viṣṇu%}” (VI, {@8@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked about {%Bhārata-varṣa (k%}), about which
{%Duryodhana%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are so covetous. {%Sañjaya%} said
that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were not covetous about it, but {%Duryodhana%},
{%Śakuni%}, etc.; then he mentioned in {%Bhārata-varṣa%}, the
beloved land of {%Indra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">αα</lang>), inhabited by {%Aryans%} and
{%Mlecchas%}, the mountains—{%Mahendra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>); rivers (“all
mothers of the universe and productive of great merit”)—
{%Gaṅgā%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>); countries—{%Kuru-Pāñcālāḥ%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>); and
countries in the south—{%Draviḍāḥ%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ν</lang>); the tribes of the
north—{%Mlecchāḥ%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ξ</lang>); and in the east and the north—
{%Śūdrābhīrāḥ%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">ο</lang>) (VI, {@9@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} inquired about
life, strength, etc., in {%Bhārata-varṣa%}, and of {%Haimavata-varṣa%}
and {%Harivarṣa. Sañjaya%} related of the four {%yugas—Kṛta%},
etc. (<lang n="greek">π</lang>). The portion that remains of the {%Dvāpara%} age is
small. {%Haimavata-varṣa%} is superior to {%Bhārata-varṣa%}, and
{%Harivarṣa%} superior to {%Haimavata-varṣa%}, in every respect
(VI, {@10@}).
