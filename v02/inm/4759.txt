[{@Jambūkhaṇḍavinirmāṇaparvan@}¦ {%(°va)%}] (“the sec-
<div n="lb">tion relating to the measurement of Jambūkhaṇḍa,” the 67th
<div n="lb">of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. °vinirmāṇa). § 574:
<div n="lb">{%Janamejaya%} inquired how the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Somakas%} fought on {%Kurukṣetra. Vaiśampāyana%} began the
<div n="lb">description of the battle. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} occupied the western
<div n="lb">part, turned towards the east, beyond {%Samantapañcaka.%} The
<div n="lb">force was collected from the whole of {%Jambudvīpa. Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira%} and {%Duryodhana%} fixed watchwords. Seeing {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%} (description), the {%Pāñcālas%} were filled with joy, and
<div n="lb">blew their conches, etc.; {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} also blew their
<div n="lb">conches {%Devadatta%} and {%Pāñcajanya,%} at which the {%Kurus%} were
<div n="lb">alarmed. Various ill omens were beheld. Both parties settled
<div n="lb">rules and made covenants regarding the different kinds
<div n="lb">of combat (VI, {@1@}). {%Vyāsa%} visited {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} and offered to
<div n="lb">grant him spiritual vision that he might witness the battle.
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} did not like to see the slaughter of his kinsmen.
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} then granted it to {%Sañjaya,%} that he might narrate
<div n="lb">everything to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra;%} weapons would not hurt him;
<div n="lb">he would come out of the battle with life. {%Vyāsa%} informed
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of the omens (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and appealed to him for
<div n="lb">peace; but {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} urged the disobedience of his sons.
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} enumerated to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} the omens that indicate
<div n="lb">victory, and recommended negotiation, as victory was uncertain
<div n="lb">(VI, {@2, 3@}). Then {%Vyāsa%} departed. Seeing the many hundreds
<div n="lb">of millions of men that had come together at {%Kurujāṅgala%} to
<div n="lb">lay down their very lives for the sake of the earth, {%Dhṛtarā-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭra%} inquired of {%Sañjaya%} after the attributes of Earth, and
<div n="lb">the details about the countries and cities from which they
<div n="lb">had come. {%Sañjaya%} discoursed on the merits of the earth,
<div n="lb">and the various classes of creatures inhabiting it. Their
<div n="lb">twenty-four constituents are described as {%Gāyatrī%} (VI, {@4@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} inquired about the rivers, mountains, and
<div n="lb">provinces of the earth, and their dimensions. {%Sañjaya%} spoke
<div n="lb">of the five elements and their attributes, earth being the
<div n="lb">foremost. Then he began the description of the dvīpa of
<div n="lb">{%Sudarśana%} (VI, {@5@}). {%Sañjaya%} discoursed on the six mountains
<div n="lb">({%varṣaparvatāḥ,%} B.) that extend from the eastern to the
<div n="lb">western ocean, and are the resort of Si. and Cā.: {%Himavat;%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and the {%varṣas%} between them—{%Bhārata-varṣa,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Mālyavat, Gandhamādana; Meru%} (description); the four
<div n="lb">islands beside {%Meru—Bhadrāśva,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the bird {%Sumukha%}
<div n="lb">{%(b);%} on {%Meru%} sport D., G., As., Rā., and Aps., and
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán, Rudra,%} and {%Śakra%} perform sacrifices; {%Tumburu,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), adore the gods with hymns; the seven {%Ṛṣis%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kaśyapa%} repair thither on every {%parvan%}-day (i.e. the day of
<div n="lb">full moon and that of new moon); upon the summit is {%Uśanas%}
<div n="lb">with the {%Daityas;%} the jewels, etc., come from {%Meru,%} one-fourth
<div n="lb">part being enjoyed by {%Kubera,%} who gives only one-sixteenth
<div n="lb">to men. On the northern side of {%Meru%} is a forest of {%karṇi-%}
<div n="lb">{%kāras;%} there {%Paśupati%} (the creator of all things), together with
<div n="lb">his celestial attendants and {%Umā,%} sports, bearing a chain of
<div n="lb">{%karṇikāra%} flowers reaching down to his feet, and his three
<div n="lb">eyes resembling three suns; the {%Siddhas%} can behold him, but
<div n="lb">not persons of wicked conduct; from the summit of that
<div n="lb">mountain {%Gaṅgā (c)%} falls down. On the western side of
[Page350-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Meru%} is {%Ketumāla (d),%} and also {%Jambūkhaṇḍa, Gandhamādana%}
<div n="lb">{%(e).%} The last {%varṣa%} in the north and {%Bharata's varṣa%} in the
<div n="lb">south are both of the form of a bow. Amongst these seven
<div n="lb">{%varṣas%} that which is further north excels the one to its
<div n="lb">immediate south in respect of longevity, stature, health,
<div n="lb">righteousness, pleasure, and profit. The huge mountains of
<div n="lb">{%Hemakūṭa%} are also called {%Kailāsa,%} where {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e.
<div n="lb">Kubera) lives in joy with Gh. To the north of {%Kailāsa%} and
<div n="lb">near the mountains of {%Maināka%} there is the huge and beautiful
<div n="lb">mountain {%Hiraṇyaśṛṅga.%} Beside this the delightful lake
<div n="lb">{%Bindusaras (f),%} with golden sands. Rā. reside on {%Himavat,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The two dvīpas {%Nāgadvīpa%} and {%Kaśyapadvīpa%} are
<div n="lb">the two ears of this hare-shaped region; the beautiful
<div n="lb">mountains of {%Malaya,%} having rocks like copper plates, form
<div n="lb">another part of {%Jambūdvīpa,%} making it resemble a hare (VI,
<div n="lb">{@6@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} about the regions to the
<div n="lb">north and the east side of {%Meru,%} and about the mountains of
<div n="lb">{%Mālyavat. Sañjaya%} told about the {%Uttarakurus (Uttarāḥ%}
<div n="lb">{%Kuravaḥ) (g).%} East of {%Meru%} the foremost region is {%Bhadrāśva%}
<div n="lb">{%(h).%} The {%jambū%} tree {%(i). Mālyavat (j)%} (VI, {@7@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
<div n="lb">inquired about the names of all the {%varṣas%} and mountains.
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} related of {%Ramaṇaka,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became
<div n="lb">absorbed in meditation about his sons; then he said: “Time
<div n="lb">destroys and creates everything; {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa,%}
<div n="lb">omniscient, destroying all creatures {%(sarvabhūtahṛt),%} the
<div n="lb">gods call him {%Vaikuṇṭha,%} men call him {%Viṣṇu%}” (VI, {@8@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked about {%Bhārata-varṣa (k),%} about which
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are so covetous. {%Sañjaya%} said
<div n="lb">that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were not covetous about it, but {%Duryodhana,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni,%} etc.; then he mentioned in {%Bhārata-varṣa,%} the
<div n="lb">beloved land of {%Indra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), inhabited by {%Aryans%} and
<div n="lb">{%Mlecchas,%} the mountains—{%Mahendra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); rivers (“all
<div n="lb">mothers of the universe and productive of great merit”)—
<div n="lb">{%Gaṅgā,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); countries—{%Kuru-Pāñcālāḥ,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); and
<div n="lb">countries in the south—{%Draviḍāḥ,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the tribes of the
<div n="lb">north—{%Mlecchāḥ,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); and in the east and the north—
<div n="lb">{%Śūdrābhīrāḥ,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VI, {@9@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} inquired about
<div n="lb">life, strength, etc., in {%Bhārata-varṣa,%} and of {%Haimavata-varṣa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Harivarṣa. Sañjaya%} related of the four {%yugas—Kṛta,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The portion that remains of the {%Dvāpara%} age is
<div n="lb">small. {%Haimavata-varṣa%} is superior to {%Bhārata-varṣa,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Harivarṣa%} superior to {%Haimavata-varṣa,%} in every respect
<div n="lb">(VI, {@10@}).
