[{@Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the discourse between
<div n="lb">Bali and Indra”). {%(a)%} § 671{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): One day, after
<div n="lb">having subjugated all As., {%Indra%} asked {%Brahmán%} where
<div n="lb">{%Bali%} now was, he who was {%Vāyu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Brahmán%} said
<div n="lb">that {%Bali%} might now have taken his birth among camels or
<div n="lb">bulls, etc., and be staying in a deserted house; he told
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} not to slay him, but to ask him for instruction
<div n="lb">in morality. {%Indra%} roamed over the earth on {%Airāvata,%}
<div n="lb">and found {%Bali%} in a deserted house in the form of an ass.
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} scoffed at him, and asked if he did not grieve, and
<div n="lb">where his 42,000 {%Gandharvas%} had gone who in former days
<div n="lb">used to dance before him, and also about the garland given
<div n="lb">to him by {%Brahmán. Bali%} said: “When thou becomest like
<div n="lb">me, thou wilt not indulge in speech like this” (XII, {@223@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bali%} said that D., men, P., G., snakes, and Rā. were under
<div n="lb">his sway in days gone by, and that all creatures used to
<div n="lb">flatter him; but he did not grieve at all; in reality it is Time
<div n="lb">that creates and destroys all things, though living creatures
<div n="lb">brag of doing this or that; “this royal glory {%(rājya-śrī)%}
<div n="lb">…does not dwell long in one place; she had dwelt
<div n="lb">in thousands of {%Indras%} before thee, who were very much
<div n="lb">superior to thee;…knowing thee to be full of
<div n="lb">vanity, she will very soon desert thee” (XII, {@224@}). {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">saw {%Śrī,%} adorned with head-plumes, etc., issue out of {%Bali,%}
<div n="lb">who did not know whether she was an As. damsel or
<div n="lb">a celestial one or a human one; {%Indra%} asked her who she
<div n="lb">was, as she stood there like {%Māyā%} herself; she said:
<div n="lb">“{%Virocana%} did not know me; {%Bali%} does not know me; the
<div n="lb">learned called me {%Duḥsahā.%} (‘difficult to be borne’), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">thou knowest me not, O {%Indra,%} nor does any one of the deities
<div n="lb">know me; nor the Creator {%(Dhātā),%} nor the Ordainer
<div n="lb">{%(Vidhātā)%} rules over me; it is {%Time%} that moves me from
<div n="lb">one place to another; do not disregard {%Bali. Bali%} has fallen off
<div n="lb">from truth, etc.; formerly he was devoted to the {%brahmans,%}
<div n="lb">etc.; but latterly he began to cherish feelings of animosity
<div n="lb">towards the {%brahmans%} and touched clarified butter with soiled
<div n="lb">hands; therefore I desert him and shall henceforth dwell in
<div n="lb">thee; there is none among D., G., As., or Rā. that can keep me
<div n="lb">for ever.” Requested by {%Indra,%} she told him how she might
<div n="lb">be able to reside in him permanently, dividing herself into
<div n="lb">four parts, according to the ordinance laid down in the {%Vedas:%}
<div n="lb">one to be established on earth, one in the waters, one in
<div n="lb">Fire, one among the good, while {%Indra%} should continue to
<div n="lb">protect her. {%Bali%} said that when the Sun would shine only
<div n="lb">upon the region of {%Brahmán%} in the middle of {%Sumeru,%} then
<div n="lb">a great battle between the gods and the {%Asuras%} would again
<div n="lb">occur, and in that fight {%Bali%} would certainly vanquish them
<div n="lb">all. {%Indra%} said that {%Brahmán%} had commanded him never
<div n="lb">to kill him; “never will come the day when the Sun will
<div n="lb">shine only from the meridian {%(madhyataḥ sthitaḥ); Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">has before this laid down the laws that regulate the Sun's
<div n="lb">motions…” {%Bali%} proceeded towards the South;
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} proceeded towards the North and ascended the skies
<div n="lb">(XII, {@225@}).—{%(b)%} § 673{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said:
<div n="lb">After the battle between the gods and the {%Asuras,%} in which
<div n="lb">a large number of Dai. and Dā. fell, {%Bali%} became king. He
<div n="lb">was deceived by {%Viṣṇu,%} who once more established his sway
<div n="lb">over all the worlds. {%Indra%} was once more invested with the
<div n="lb">sovereignty of the gods, etc.; the three worlds once more
<div n="lb">swelled with prosperity, and {%Brahmán%} became glad of heart.
<div n="lb">At that time {%Indra,%} accompanied by R., V., Ā., A., D.-ṛ., G.,
[Page112-a+ 62]
<div n="lb">Si., etc., seated on the four-tusked {%Airāvata,%} made a progress
<div n="lb">through all the worlds. Once he saw {%Bali Vairocani%} within
<div n="lb">a certain mountain cave on the sea-shore. {%Bali%} showed no
<div n="lb">signs of sorrow or agitation. {%Indra%} asked him how it was
<div n="lb">that he was so unmoved; “thou art bound with {%Varuṇa's%}
<div n="lb">noose and hast been struck with my thunderbolt.” {%Bali%}
<div n="lb">said: “What I am now, thou wilt be in the future,”
<div n="lb">explaining that only time (not merit) rules the destiny of
<div n="lb">men; “that thou regardest thyself as the actor is the root
<div n="lb">of all sorrow”; “in the course of time many thousands of
<div n="lb">{%Indras%} and of deities have been swept away {%yuga%} after {%yuga,%}
<div n="lb">and will be swept away in future…, just as {%Pṛthu,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),” though they were devoted to the {%Vedas%} and {%Vedio%}
<div n="lb">rites, etc., and though all of them were the offspring of
<div n="lb">{%Dakṣa's%} daughters; “those 1,000 [celestial years], that are
<div n="lb">the measure of thy sway, will surely come to an end”; “Ā.,
<div n="lb">R., Sā., V., and M. were all vanquished by me,” etc.
<div n="lb">{%Indra's%} panegyric on {%Bali. Indra%} left the spot and was
<div n="lb">praised by the M.-ṛ.; {%Fire%} once more began to bear the
<div n="lb">libations [to the gods], etc. (XII, {@227@}).
