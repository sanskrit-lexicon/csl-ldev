{@Śārṅgakopākhyana(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to the śārṅ-
<div n="lb">gaka birds”). § 259 (Khāṇḍavad.): {%Janamejaya%} said: “Why
<div n="lb">did the {%śārṅgakas%} escape?” {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: When the
<div n="lb">{%maharṣi Mandapāla,%} who was an {%ūrdhvaretas,%} had finished
<div n="lb">his {%tapas,%} he left his body and went to {%Pitṛloka,%} but did not
<div n="lb">obtain the expected result of his acts, and learned from the
<div n="lb">gods sitting around {%Dharmarāja%} that it was because he had
<div n="lb">no offspring. He then reflected how he could obtain numerous
<div n="lb">offspring in the shortest time possible; he learnt that the
<div n="lb">birds were peculiarly prolific, and, becoming a {%śārṅgika,%}
<div n="lb">he married the {%śārṅgikā Jaritā,%} and begat upon her four
<div n="lb">sons, who were all reciters of the {%Vedas.%} Then he left
<div n="lb">her and married {%Lapitā.%} When {%Agni%} came to the forest
<div n="lb">of {%Khāṇḍava%} to burn it down, {%Mandapāla%} praised {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">(vv. 8353—8360) and prevailed upon him to spare his children
<div n="lb">(I, {@229@}). {%Jaritā%} told her sons ({%Jaritāri, Sārisṛkva, Stamba-%}
<div n="lb">{%mitra,%} and {%Droṇa%}), who would have her to rescue herself by
<div n="lb">abandoning them, to conceal themselves in the hole of a mouse;
<div n="lb">but they were afraid of the mouse (I, {@230@}). Finally {%Jaritā%}
<div n="lb">was prevailed upon by her sons to abandon them, and {%Agni%}
<div n="lb">approached the spot where the sons were (I, {@231@}). The four
<div n="lb">young {%ṛṣis%} praised {%Agni,%} who promised them safety and
<div n="lb">granted them a boon. {%Droṇa%} asked him to consume the cats
<div n="lb">that troubled them every day (I, {@232@}). Mean while {%Manda-%}
<div n="lb">{%pāla%} addressed {%Lapitā,%} being anxious about his children.
<div n="lb">{%Lapitā,%} from jealousy, told him to go to {%Jaritā,%} who, she
<div n="lb">said, was the real cause of his anxiety. When {%Agni%} had
<div n="lb">spared the children, {%Jaritā%} came and embraced them. When
<div n="lb">{%Mandapāla%} came they did not speak to him, and {%Jaritā,%} from
<div n="lb">jealousy, told him to go to {%Lapitā. Mandapāla%} declared that
<div n="lb">nothing was so destructive to the happiness of women as
<div n="lb">a concubine, except a lover; witness {%Arundhatī (b).%} Then
<div n="lb">all his children came forward to worship him, and he also
<div n="lb">spoke kindly to them all (I, {@233@}). {%Mandapāla%} told that
[Page197-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">he had asked {%Agni%} to protect them, and therefore he had not
<div n="lb">come earlier. Then he took his wives and sons with him and
<div n="lb">went away to some other country (I, {@234@}).
