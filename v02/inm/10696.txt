[{@Svayaṃvaraparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating how
Draupadī chose herself a husband”, the 12th of the minor
parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Svayaṃvara). § 231. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} went to the {%Pāñcāla%} land in the company of
{%brahmans%}, who told them of the {%svayaṃvara%}, and of {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%}, and {%Kṛṣṇā%} (I, {@184@}). On their way they beheld
{%Dvaipāyana%}. They took up their quarters in the house of a
potter, and adopting the brahmanical profession, they began
to lead a mendicant life. {%Yajñasena%} (= Drupada) always
cherished the wish of bestowing his daughter on {%Kirīṭin%}
(i.e. Arjuna), but never spoke of this wish to anybody. He
therefore caused a very stiff bow to be made, which was
[Page672-a+ 63]
incapable of being bent by anybody except {%Arjuna%}; and
causing some machinery to be erected in the sky, he set up a
mark attached to that machinery, and said: “He who with
this bow and these arrows hits the mark shall obtain my
daughter.” Among the kings that came were {%Duryodhana%}
and the {%Kurus%} and {%Karṇa%}. The princes entered the arena
by the north-eastern gate ({%śiśumāraśiraḥ prāpya%}). The arena
was situated to the north-east of the capital (description of
it). On the 16th day {%Draupadī%}, having bathed, entered
the arena. Then the {%purohita%} of the {%Somakas%} gratified {%Agni%}.
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, possessing a voice deep as that of a kettle-
drum or of the clouds, taking hold of his sister's arm, stood
in the midst of the arena, and said: “Hit the mark by
means of these five arrows.” Then he addressed his sister,
reciting to her the names, etc. of the assembled princes
(I, {@185@}).—§ 232. Enumeration (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) of the assembled princes
(I, {@186@}).—§ 233. There came also the {%devagaṇas%} on their
chariots; the {%Rudras%} and the {%Ādityas%}, the {%Vasus%} and the
{%Aśvins%}, the {%Sādhyas%} and all the {%Maruts%}, with {%Yama%} and
{%Dhaneśvara%} (i.e. Kubera) walking ahead; and also the {%Daityas%}
and {%Suparṇas%}, the {%mahoragas%}, the {%Devarṣis%}, the {%Guhyakas%}
and the {%Cāraṇas, Viśvāvasu, Nārada%} and {%Parvata%}, the principal
{%Gandharvas%} with the {%Apsarases%}, and the {%Asuras%} and {%Siddhas%}
(v. 7017), and {%Halāyudha%} (i.e. Balarāma), and {%Janārdana%}
(i.e. Kṛṣṇa), and the chiefs of the {%Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas%}, and
{%Yadus%}, always obedient to Kṛṣṇa. {%Kṛṣṇa%} pointed out the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} to his brother {%Rāma%}. When {%Duryodhana%}, the {%Cedi-%}
king {%Śiśupāla%} (son of {%Damaghoṣa%}), {%Jarāsandha%}, the {%Madra-%}
king {%Śalya%}, etc. had in vain tried to string the bow, and
{%Karṇa%}, though having succeeded in stringing it, had, as a {%sūta%},
been rejected by {%Kṛṣṇā, Jiṣṇu%} (i.e. Arjuna) came forward
(I, {@187@}). Some of the brahmans spoke reproachingly of
{%Arjuna's%} daring undertaking, some approved of it (citing
{%Paraśurāma%} and {%Agastya's%} drinking out of the Sea). {%Arjuna%},
bending his head to {%Īśāna%} and remembering {%Kṛṣṇa%}, accom-
plished the task. The gods showered celestial flowers.
{%Drupada%} was filled with joy. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with the twins
returned home. {%Kṛṣṇā%} approached {%Arjuna%}, who soon after-
wards left the lists followed by her (I, {@188@}).—§ 234. When
{%Drupada%} expressed his desire of bestowing his daughter on
that {%brahman%}, the kings resolved to slay {%Drupada%} and burn
{%Kṛṣṇā%}, but spare {%Arjuna%}, whom they took for a {%brahman%}.
They rushed at {%Drupada%}, who was defended by {%Arjuna%} with
the bow and by {%Bhīma%} with a tree torn up by the root.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} then knew, and said to {%Balarāma%} that they must be
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, who had escaped from the fire (I, {@189@}).
{%Karṇa%} was defeated by {%Arjuna%} (“accomplished in the {%Brāhma%}
and the {%Paurandara%} weapons”, v. 7105), and the {%Madra-%}king
{%Śalya%} by {%Bhīma%}; then {%Duryodhana%}, etc., who had been
engaged with the {%brahmans%}, desisted from the combat, because
{%brahmans%}, though offending, should yet always be protected.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} said to them that those {%brahmans%} had justly acquired
the maiden. The kings returned to their respective kingdoms.
{%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}, with difficulty, escaped from the throng,
followed by {%Kṛṣṇā%}.—§ 235. {%Kuntī%} was filled with anxiety,
seeing that her sons were late in returning from their begging
tour. Then, in the late afternoon, {%Jiṣṇu%} (i.e. Arjuna),
accompanied by a body of {%brahmans%}, entered the abode of the
{%Bhārgava%} (i.e. the potter, Nīl.) (I, {@190@}). {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}
presented {%Kṛṣṇā%} as their “alms”, and {%Kuntī%}, not yet seeing
them, said: “enjoy ye all.” Afterwards, she was alarmed
at what she had said. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} declared that {%Arjuna%}
should wed her; but {%Arjuna%} replied that it was a sin for the
[Page672-b+ 59]
younger brother to marry before the elder. Meanwhile, they
all fell in love with {%Kṛṣṇā%}. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} recollected
the words of {%Vyāsa%}, and, from fear of a division amongst the
brothers, said that she should be the common wife of them
all. {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Balarāma%} then paid them a visit, and again
went away (I, {@191@}).—§ 236: When {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}
were turning towards the abode of the {%Bhārgava, Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%} followed them and concealed himself in some part of
the house. Then {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} and the twins returning
from their begging tour in the evening, gave everything to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Kuntī%} caused {%Kṛṣṇā%} to distribute it, giving to
{%Bhīma%} alone as much as to all the others, because he always
ate much. Then they laid down for the night, and {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%} overheard their conversations. In the morning
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} set out to report it to {%Drupada%}, who was sad,
because he did not know, if perhaps a man of mean descent
had taken away his daughter, though he thought it possible
that it was Arjuna (I, {@192@}).
