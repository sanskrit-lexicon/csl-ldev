{@Parikṣit@}¦ or {@Parīkṣit@} (C. has in book I {%°rī°%}, in books
X-XVII {%°ri°%}; B. mostly {%°ri°%}), son of Abhimanyu and
Uttarā, and father of Janamejaya. § 11 (Parvasaṅgr.): I,
{@2@}, 606 ({%°aḥ…janma, °rī°%} also B.).—§ 51 (cf. Āstīkap.):
One day king {%P.%}, the son of {%Abhimanyu%}, when hunting,
having pierced a deer lost sight of it. He then asked the
muni {%Śamīka%}, but received no answer as the muni was then
observing the vow of silence; in anger the king then placed
upon the muni's shoulder a dead snake and returned to his
capital {%Hāstinapura%}. Of this the muni's son {%Śṛṅgin%} was
informed in a quarrel by his companion {%Kṛśa%} (I, {@40@}), and
then cursed {%P.%}, saying that within seven nights he should
be stung to death by {%Takṣaka%}. The muni was not pleased
with the curse, as {%P%}. properly protected his subjects (I, {@41@}).
Therefore he sent his disciple {%Gauramukha%} to inform {%P.%}, who
became very repentant and sorrowful. A mansion was
erected upon a solitary column and well guarded. The
seventh day the brahman {%Kāśyapa%} was coming desirous
of curing the king. {%Takṣaka%} in the shape of an old
brahman met with {%Kāśyapa%} (I, {@42@}). As {%Kāśyapa%} revived
a banyan which had been reduced to ashes by being bitten
by {%Takṣaka, Takṣaka%} gave to {%Kāśyapa%} more wealth than
what he expected from {%P.%}, and having ascertained by means
of {%yoga%} that {%P.'s%} span of life was at an end, {%Kāśyapa%}
retired. {%Takṣaka%} went to {%Hāstinapura%}, and hearing that {%P%}.
was protected by poison-neutralizing {%mantras%} and medicines,
he caused some serpents in the guise of ascetics to present
the king with {%kuśa-%}grass, water, and fruits, in one of
which he himself was concealed as a tiny ugly insect.
As such he appeared when {%P%}. was eating the fruit. {%P%}. said:
“The sun is setting, to-day I have no more fear from poison;
therefore let this insect becoming {%Takṣaka%} bite me so that
[Page540-a+ 63]
the words of the ascetic may be rendered true.” Then he
placed the insect on his neck and was bitten by {%Takṣaka%},
who coiled round his neck and uttered a tremendous roar
(I, {@43@}): I, {@40@}, 1664 ({%Kauravavaṃśajaḥ%}), 1670, 1673 ({%rājā%}

{%…Abhimanyujaḥ%}), 1709, 1716; {@42@}, 1737, 1762 ({%nṛpaṃ%}
{%Kurukulotpaṅnaṃ%}).—§ 56 (do.): The ministers of {%Janamejaya%}
told him about {%P.%}, that he was virtuous, a pupil of {%Śāradvata%}
(i.e. {%Kṛpa%}) in the science of arms and dear to {%Govinda%} (i.e.
{%Kṛṣṇa%}), and that he had got his name because he was born
by {%Uttarā, “parikṣīṇeṣu Kuruṣu,”%} and that he ruled
sixty years; that being addicted to hunting he made over all
affairs of state to his ministers; then how he insulted {%Śamīka%},
and his death (cf. § 51); they also mentioned that {%Takṣaka%}
had insulted the {%ṛṣi Uttaṅka%}: I, {@49@}, 1934, 1947 ({%Saubha-%}

but-Kṛṣṇa promised to revive him).—§ 785 (Anugītāp.):
XIV, {@66@}, 1943 (was still-born); {@70@}, 2044 (was revived by
Kṛṣṇa; {%parikṣīṇe kule yasmād jāto 'yam Abhimanyujaḥ |%}

darśanap.): XV, {@35@}, 944 (Janamejaya wished to see {%P.%},
Vyāsa then summoned him from the other world).—§ 791
