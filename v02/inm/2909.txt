[{@Śyena-kapotākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the story of the hawk and
the pigeon”). § 738{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: Once
[Page224-a+ 54]
a pigeon, pursued by a hawk, dropped down from the skies
and sought the protection of the {%Kāśi%} king R.-ṛ. {%Vṛṣadarbha%}
(or {%Uśīnara%}), etc. [cf. Śyenakapotīya (§ 411 = III, {@130@} foll.),
but here the birds are not {%Indra%} and {%Agni%}]. The three worlds
together with {%Indra%} came to behold the king; he was bathed
in a shower of nectar, etc.; D., G., and Aps. began to sing
and dance around him, just, as they do around {%Brahmán%}; he
then ascended a celestial chariot and proceeded to the eternal
heaven. Blessing upon the reader.
