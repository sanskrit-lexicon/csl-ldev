<div n="lb">(IX, {@35—36@}), and thence to {%Vinaśana%} (IX, {@36@}), called so
<div n="lb">by the Ṛ. because the {%Sarasvatī%} has there become invisible

<div n="lb">wealth in profusion, etc., he (always smeared with white
<div n="lb">sandal-paste) set out for that spot where the {%Sarasvatī%} turns
<div n="lb">in an eastward direction in order to behold the Ṛ. in the forest
<div n="lb">of {%Naimiṣa (h),%} and he became filled with wonder. “There,
<div n="lb">at {%Kurukṣetra,%} O foremost one of {%Kuru's%} race, do thou
<div n="lb">perform great sacrifices and rites.” Thence {%Bala-Rāma%} went
<div n="lb">to the {%tīrtha Saptasārasvata%} (description), resorted to by
