Requested by {%Janamejaya%}, Vaiśampāyana related: In the
{%Kṛta%}-age, the ascetics who dwelt in {%Naimiṣa%} ({%Naimiṣeyās%}
{%tapasvinaḥ%}, IX, 2159) were engaged in a grand sacrifice
(extending over twelve years); many Ṛ. came there; after the
completion of the twelve years' sacrifice they set out in large
numbers to sojourn at the tīrthas; the tīrthas on the southern
[Page496-a+ 63]
bank of the {%Sarasvatī%} looked like towns and cities, they took
up their abodes on the bank up to {%Samantapañcaka%}, the whole
region resounded with {%Vedic%} recitations, there were present
many sorts of ascetics: {%Vālakhilyas, Aśmakuṭṭas, Dantolū-%}
{%khalins, Prasaṅkhyānas%}, such as lived on air, such as
lived on water, such as lived on leaves, such as lay on the
earth instead of in beds, etc. (cf. the note of PCR. p. 150);
they made the {%Sarasvatī%} beautiful as the gods beautify the
{%Gaṅgā%}. Not finding sufficient room on the banks of the
Sarasvatī they measured out small plots of land with their
sacred threads. For their sake the Sarasvatī appeared and
made many abodes ({%kuñjāḥ%}) in that spot, and then once more
flowed in a western direction, therefore this receptacle of
water ({%kuñjaḥ%}) is named after the ṛṣis of Naimiṣa ({%Naimi-%}
