{@Medhāvin@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ son of Bāladhi. § 415 (Tīrthayātrāp.): In
ancient times the muni {%Bāladhi%} practised austerities in order
to have an immortal son. He obtained a son {%Medhāvin%} of
a very irritable temper, but the gods did not make him
immortal; they only granted the boon that he should live
as long as the mountains existed. {%Medhāvin%} grew haughty,
and insulted the munis. The learned {%Dhanuṣākṣa%} then
cursed him, saying, “Be thou reduced to ashes.” When,
however, {%Medhāvin%} was not reduced to ashes, {%Dhānuṣākṣa%}
caused the mountains to be scattered by buffaloes, and then
{%Medhāvin%} perished. As his father bewailed him, the munis
quoted the following gāthā: “A mortal on no condition can
overcome what has been ordained by fate,” etc.: III, {@135@},
10740, 10742—3.
