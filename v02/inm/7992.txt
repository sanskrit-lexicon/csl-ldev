<div n="lb">asked {%Arjuna%} to select some spot where they might dwell
<div n="lb">undiscovered. {%Arjuna%} mentioned some countries surrounding

<div n="lb">city of king {%Virāṭa,%} who was attached to the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would introduce himself as a brahman named

<div n="lb">the tree and tied the weapons fast. In the tree they hung
<div n="lb">up a corpse and said to the inquirers: “This is our mother,
<div n="lb">aged 180 years.” They kept for themselves the names {%Jaya,%}
<div n="lb">{%jayanta, Vijaya, Jayatsena, Jayadbala%} (IV, {@5@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">praised {%Durgā (f),%} who then showed herself to him and
