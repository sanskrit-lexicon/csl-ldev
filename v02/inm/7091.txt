{@Maṅkaṇaka@}<sup>2</sup>,¦ a ṛṣi. § 365 (cf. Tīrthayātrāp.): At the
<div n="lb">tīrtha {%Saptasārasvata%} the great {%ṛṣi M.%} became perfect
<div n="lb">{%(siddhaḥ),%} so that when he had cut his hand with the pointed
<div n="lb">blade of a {%kuśa%} grass, there flew from his wound vegetable
<div n="lb">juice, at which he began to dance, and the animate and
<div n="lb">inanimate creation also began to dance together with him.
<div n="lb">Then the gods, headed by Brahman and the ṛṣis, asked
<div n="lb">{%Mahādeva%} (i.e. Śiva) to prevent him from dancing. The god
<div n="lb">then in the presence of {%M.%} pressed his thumb with the tip of
<div n="lb">his own finger, and from the wound there came ashes, white
<div n="lb">as snow. Then {%M.%} became ashamed and adored {%Rudra,%} saying
<div n="lb">that he was the refuge of the world, including the gods and
<div n="lb">the Asuras, that he had created the three worlds, and swallows
<div n="lb">everything at the end of the {%yuga,%} that he cannot be fathomed
<div n="lb">by the gods themselves, that all the gods headed by {%Brahmán%}
<div n="lb">are to be seen in him, etc. At his request {%Śiva%} said to the
<div n="lb">{%Brahmarṣi%} that his asceticism {%(tapas)%} should through the grace
<div n="lb">of {%Śiva%} increase a thousandfold, that he would dwell with
<div n="lb">him in the āśrama, and that those who bathe in {%Sapta-%}
<div n="lb">{%sārasvata%} and worship {%Śiva%} should be able to obtain
<div n="lb">everything here and hereafter, and go to the {%Sārasvata loka;%}
<div n="lb">then {%Mahādeva%} disappeared: III, {@83,@} 6086.—§ 615 (Bala-
<div n="lb">devatīrthayātrā): IX, {@37,@} 2185 ({%siddhaḥ…mahāmuniḥ,%}
<div n="lb">had performed austerities at Saptasārasvata); {@38,@} 2186.—
<div n="lb">§ 615{%j%} (do.): {%M.%} had from his youth led the life of a {%brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%cārin.%} Once, when performing his ablutions in the river
<div n="lb">{%Sarasvatī,%} he beheld a woman bathing in the river; at this
<div n="lb">sight his seed dropped and fell into the {%Sarasvatī;%} he took it
<div n="lb">up and placed it in his earthen pot; then it became divided
<div n="lb">into seven parts, whence were born seven {%ṛṣis: Vāyuvega,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), who were the progenitors of the {%Maruts.%} (Then
[Page465-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">the same story as in § 365 is related.) {%M.%} was the son of
<div n="lb">{%Mātariśvan%} and {%Sukanyā:%} IX, {@38,@} 2217, 2224, 2244.—
<div n="lb">§ 615 (do.): IX, {@39,@} 2246. Cf. Brahmarṣi.
