[{@Aṣṭāvakra-Dik-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“discourse between
<div n="lb">Aṣṭāvakra and the goddess of the North”). § 731{%b%}
<div n="lb">(Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@19@} ff.: {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of
<div n="lb">yore {%Aṣṭāvakra%} (of severe penances) asked Ṛ. {%Vadānya%} for
<div n="lb">his beautiful daughter {%Suprabhā. Vadānya%} first caused him to
<div n="lb">make a journey to the North, indicating the road: (1) {%Himavat%}
<div n="lb">(peopled by Si. and Cā.); (2) the sacred river {%Bāhudā,%}
<div n="lb">where he bathed in one of the {%tīrthas,%} etc. (description),
<div n="lb">and worshipped {%Rudra%} and {%Umā;%} (3) {%Kailāsa,%} where he saw
<div n="lb">a golden gate, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and was honoured by {%Kubera%} among
<div n="lb">Y. (with {%Maṇibhadra%}), G., and K., and where Aps. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) danced;
<div n="lb">there he remained a celestial year; (4) having crossed
<div n="lb">{%Kailāsa%} and {%Mandara%} as also the golden mountains, he came
<div n="lb">to the region where {%Mahādeva%} resides attired as an ascetic,
<div n="lb">{%Pārṣadas%} of which are frolicsome and fond of dance and
<div n="lb">possessed of faces of diverse forms, which was peopled by Si.,
<div n="lb">Cā., and Pc., where {%Umā%} had practised austerities for the sake
<div n="lb">of [obtaining] {%Śiva;%} where, in days of yore, on the {%Mahāpārśva%}
<div n="lb">[mountain] (to the north of the god) the Seasons, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>),
<div n="lb">in their material forms had adored {%Mahādeva;%} (5) a beautiful
<div n="lb">forest (description), where the river {%Mandākinī%} was seen,
<div n="lb">with an old and decrepit female ascetic (with many beautiful
<div n="lb">maidens), who in vain tempted him with love (XIII, {@19@}),
<div n="lb">at last appearing in a beautiful form (XIII, {@20@}). She
<div n="lb">turned out to be the goddess of the North {%(Uttarāṃ diśaṃ),%}
<div n="lb">who, having been gratified by Ṛ. {%Vadānya,%} had devised this
<div n="lb">trial and now instructed him, showing him the levity of
<div n="lb">women, even when aged; “thou hast subjugated all the
<div n="lb">worlds by thy strength of mind; thy journey back will not
<div n="lb">be irksome thou wilt obtain the wife thou hast chosen;
[Page093-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">she will bear thee a son.” {%Aṣṭāvakra%} came back to his
<div n="lb">own abode, and then to {%Vadānya,%} who wedded him to the
<div n="lb">girl. There he continued to dwell joyously in his own
<div n="lb">hermitage (XIII, {@21@}).
