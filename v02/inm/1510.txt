[{@Bhīṣmavadhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
<div n="lb">slaying of Bhīṣma,” the 70th of the minor parvans of
<div n="lb">Mhbhr.; cf. Bhīṣmavadha). § 577: Beholding {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">again taking up the {%Gāṇḍīva,%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Somakas%}
<div n="lb">were filled with joy and blew their conches, etc. D., G., P.,
<div n="lb">Si., Cā., and Ṛ. came with {%Indra%} in order to behold the fight.
<div n="lb">Putting off his coat of mail, etc., {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} followed by
<div n="lb">his brothers (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (who did not know his intentions) and {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">proceeded on foot, with joined hands, to {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), one
<div n="lb">after another, and asked their permission to fight. He also
<div n="lb">inquired about the means of vanquishing {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa,%}
<div n="lb">and as they said that they were invincible he asked them to
<div n="lb">indicate the means of killing them. They gave the permission,
<div n="lb">said they would pray for his victory, though they were bound
<div n="lb">by the wealth of the {%Kurus%} to fight for them. {%Bhīṣma%} said
<div n="lb">that his time of death had not yet come, he must come to see
<div n="lb">him once more. {%Droṇa%} said that if he did not give himself
<div n="lb">up to death and drop his weapons nobody would be able to
<div n="lb">slay him; he would drop his arms if he heard something very
<div n="lb">disagreeable from someone whose speech was trustworthy.
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa%} said he was incapable of being slain. {%Śalya%} renewed
<div n="lb">his promise to weaken the energy of {%Karṇa.%} When the
<div n="lb">{%Kauravas%} saw {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} they contemned him, believing
<div n="lb">that he had come in terror. {%Kṛṣṇa%} endeavoured to bring
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa%} over to the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} as long as {%Bhīṣma%} was not slain,
<div n="lb">but in vain. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} exclaimed, “He who chooses us,
<div n="lb">him we will choose for our ally”; {%Yuyutsu%} went over to the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that the propagation of
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} lineage and his śrāddha oblations rested
<div n="lb">on him. The {%Mlecchas%} and {%Aryans%} wept for joy at the
<div n="lb">behaviour of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and blew their conches, etc.
<div n="lb">(VI, {@43@}).—§ 578: THE FIRST DAY'S ENCOUNTER: {%Duḥśāsana%}
<div n="lb">advanced with his troops with {%Bhīṣma%} at their head,
<div n="lb">and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} headed by {%Bhīmasena,%} who roared fright-
<div n="lb">fully. {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Bhīmasena.%} The
<div n="lb">{%Draupadeyas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), rushed against the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras.%}
<div n="lb">The disciples of {%Droṇa%} always hit the mark (VI, {@44@}).

<div n="lb">(24) The {%Cedi%} king attacked {%Ulūka.%} Thousands of single
<div n="lb">combats took place. D.-ṛ., Si., and Cā. beheld the battle,
<div n="lb">which resembled the combat of D. and As. (VI, {@45@}). The
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Kurus%} fought as if they were possessed by
<div n="lb">demons. The divisions of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} approaching {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">{%(b),%} began to yield (VI, {@46@}). (25) After the greater part of the
<div n="lb">forenoon had worn out, {%Durmukha,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), began to protect
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} who rushed upon the {%Cedis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). (26) Then
<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu (c)%} attacked {%Bhīṣma, Kṛtavarman, Śalya,%}
<div n="lb">{%Durmukha%} (cutting off the head of his charioteer), and
<div n="lb">{%Kṛpa%} (cutting in two his bow); he was regarded as equal
<div n="lb">to {%Arjuna,%} and his bow sent forth a twang like that of the
<div n="lb">{%Gāṇḍīva;%} he stood firm like the {%Maināka%} mountain. When
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma's%} standard fell down, {%Bhīma%} shouted. {%Bhīṣma%} used
<div n="lb">celestial weapons. (27) In order to protect {%Abhimanyu,%}
<div n="lb">{%Virāṭa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Bhīṣma,%} who wounded {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna%} and {%Sātyaki,%} and they cut off the standard of {%Bhīma-%}
<div n="lb">{%sena (d),%} who wounded {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman.%}
<div n="lb">(28) Mounted on an elephant, {%Uttara%} (the son of {%Virāṭa%})
<div n="lb">attacked the {%Madra%} king {%Śalya,%} whose steeds were killed
<div n="lb">by the elephant; {%Śalya,%} with a dart, deprived {%Uttara%} of his
<div n="lb">senses, and mounted the chariot of {%Kṛtavarman.%} (29) Seeing
<div n="lb">his brother {%Uttara%} slain and {%Śalya%} staying with {%Kṛtavarman,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śveta%} (the son of {%Virāṭa%}) attacked {%Śalya.%} (30) The {%Kosala%}
<div n="lb">king {%Bṛhadbala,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Śveta%} in order to protect
<div n="lb">{%Śalya; Śveta%} wounded {%Rukmaratha,%} who was borne away
<div n="lb">by his charioteer. (31) Then {%Duryodhana,%} with {%Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">etc., attacked {%Śveta%} and rescued {%Śalya; Bhīṣma%} shot
<div n="lb">at {%Abhimanyu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VI, {@47@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas,%} with
<div n="lb">{%Śikhaṇḍin,%} desired to rescue the generalissimo {%Śveta%} and
<div n="lb">attacked {%Bhīṣma.%} The {%Kurus%} retreated from fear, and
<div n="lb">abandoned {%Bhīṣma.%} (32) {%Duryodhana%} averted {%Śveta%} from
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} and was routed; (33) {%Śveta%} once more attacked
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} whose standard he cut down; (34) then {%Bāhlīka,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Śveta%} in order to protect {%Bhīṣma,%} whose
<div n="lb">chariot {%Śveta%} reduced to ashes, with standard, etc.; (35)
<div n="lb">{%Śalya,%} etc., rushed to {%Bhīṣma's%} rescue; a voice in the skies
<div n="lb">admonished {%Bhīṣma%} to hasten the death of {%Śveta.%} (36)
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), rushed to the rescue of {%Śveta. Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), checked them. With a shaft endued with the
<div n="lb">force of the {%Brāhma%} weapon, seen by D., G., P., U., and
<div n="lb">Rā., {%Bhīṣma%} shot {%Śveta%} to death. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} (with
<div n="lb">{%Śikhaṇḍin%}) lamented; the {%Kurus%} rejoiced; {%Duḥśāsana%} danced
<div n="lb">for joy. {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} withdrew the troops, the same
<div n="lb">did the {%Kurus%} (VI, {@48@}). (37) When {%Śveta%} had been slain,
[Page141-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">{%Virāṭa's%} son {%Śaṅkha,%} on beholding {%Śalya%} standing with
<div n="lb">{%Kṛtavarman,%} attacked {%Śalya;%} (38) {%Bhīṣma%} attacked {%Śaṅkha;%}
<div n="lb">(39) {%Arjuna%} placed himself in front of {%Śaṅkha%} and attacked
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma;%} (40) {%Śalya,%} mace in hand, slew the steeds of
<div n="lb">{%Śaṅkha,%} who mounted {%Arjuna's%} chariot. (41) {%Bhīṣma%} with
<div n="lb">his arrows slaughtered the {%Pāñcāla%} hosts, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), abandoned
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna,%} and attacked {%Drupada.%} The {%Pāṇḍavas%} were routed,
<div n="lb">the sun set, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} withdrew their forces (VI, {@49@}).
<div n="lb">Seeing {%Bhīṣma's%} (and {%Droṇa's%}) prowess, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} com-
<div n="lb">plained before {%Kṛṣṇa,%} and spoke of retiring into the woods.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} alone, he said, fought in accordance with {%kṣattriya%}
<div n="lb">duties; {%Arjuna%} was indifferent. {%Kṛṣṇa%} consoled him,
<div n="lb">saying that he had got {%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and that {%Śikhaṇḍin%}
<div n="lb">was certainly the slayer of {%Bhīṣma. Yudhiṣṭhira%} then
<div n="lb">addressed {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} saying that he himself and {%Bhīma,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), would follow him. {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} said that he had
<div n="lb">been appointed by {%Śambhu%} to slay {%Droṇa%} and to fight against
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} recommended the array
<div n="lb">called {%Krauñcāruṇa,%} which {%Bṛhaspati%} had explained to {%Indra%}
<div n="lb">in days of old, when the gods and the {%Asuras%} fought, but
<div n="lb">which had never been seen before. When morning dawned,
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} placed {%Arjuna%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) in the van of the army, and
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} became the head [of the array], etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VI, {@50@}).
<div n="lb">Seeing the {%Krauñca%} of the {%Pāṇḍavas, Duryodhana,%} approaching
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), gladdened them all, saying that their army,
<div n="lb">which was protected by {%Bhīṣma,%} was immeasurable, while
<div n="lb">that of the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} protected by {%Bhīma,%} was measurable.
<div n="lb">The {%Saṃsthānas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), should protect {%Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma,%}
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa,%} and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} formed a mighty array. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">was followed by {%Droṇa%} with the {%Kuntalas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Śakuni%}
<div n="lb">protected {%Droṇa.%} Followed by his brothers and the {%Aśvātakas,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), {%Duryodhana%} advanced against the {%Pāṇḍava%} host.
<div n="lb">{%Bhūriśravas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), protected the left flank; {%Somadatta,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), the right; {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were in the rear;
<div n="lb">behind them {%Ketumat,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Bhīṣma%} and the others
<div n="lb">blew their conches, etc. {%Kṛṣṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), blew their
<div n="lb">conches ({%Kṛṣṇa%} blew {%Pāñcajanya,%} etc.). The {%Kurus%} and
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} marched against each other in order to renew
<div n="lb">the battle (VI, {@51@}).—§ 579: SECOND DAY: {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">began the battle. (1) {%Bhīṣma%} shot at {%Abhimanyu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>);
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to take his chariot before {%Bhīṣma;%}
<div n="lb">“protected by {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), will slaughter
<div n="lb">the {%Pāñcālas.%}” Only {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} and {%Karṇa%} could
<div n="lb">encounter {%Arjuna. Bhīṣma%} was protected by {%Saindhava%}
<div n="lb">(i.e. Jayadratha), etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), struck {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">who struck {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), surrounded
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna.%} (2) The {%Pāñcāla%} prince and the {%Somakas%} attacked
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa.%} (3) {%Bhīṣma%} fought with {%Arjuna,%} at the request
<div n="lb">of {%Duryodhana,%} who complained of the absence of {%Karṇa;%}
<div n="lb">{%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), stood for battle; {%Bhīṣma%} wounded
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa;%} D., G., Cā., and great Ṛ. said they would be
<div n="lb">invincible by all the worlds with D., As., and G. (4) See
<div n="lb">2 (VI, {@52@}): Continuation of the combat between {%Droṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna.%} (5) {%Bhīma%} attacked {%Droṇa%} in order
<div n="lb">to aid {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} whom he caused to be taken up on
<div n="lb">another chariot. (6) Urged by {%Duryodhana,%} the {%Kaliṅga%} king
<div n="lb">rushed against {%Bhīma%} in order to protect {%Droṇa.%} (7) {%Droṇa%}
<div n="lb">abandoned {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and encountered {%Virāṭa%} and {%Dru-%}
<div n="lb">{%pada.%} (8) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} proceeded to support {%Yudhiṣṭhira.%}
<div n="lb">(9) See 6 (VI, {@53@}): {%Bhīmasena%} was supported by the {%Cedis;%}
<div n="lb">the {%Kaliṅga%} king by {%Ketumat%} (son of the {%Niṣāda%} king; {%rāja-%}
<div n="lb">{%putraḥ,%} v. 2354) and {%Śrutāyus.%} The {%Cedis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked
<div n="lb">the {%Niṣādas.%} (10) The {%Cedis%} left {%Bhīmasena%} and turned
[Page141-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">back; the {%Kaliṅga%} king and his son {%Śakradeva%} fought with
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma,%} who slew {%Śakradeva%} with his mace. (11) {%Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">attacked {%Bhānumat%} (the prince of the {%Kaliṅgas%}), and slew him
<div n="lb">with his sword, dividing him in the middle, and made a great
<div n="lb">slaughter of men and elephants. (12) Beholding {%Śrutāyus%}
<div n="lb">(the ruler of the {%Kaliṅgas%}) at the head of the {%Kaliṅga%} troops,
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena%} attacked him, was wounded, and taken into his
<div n="lb">chariot by the charioteer {%Aśoka;%} once more he fought with
<div n="lb">{%Śrutāyus,%} and slew him, and {%Satyadeva,%} and {%Satya,%} and {%Ketumat,%}
<div n="lb">and routed the {%Kaliṅgas.%} (13) When, however, the {%Kaliṅgas%}
<div n="lb">were rallied again, {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} with {%Śikhaṇḍin, Yudhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣṭhira,%} etc., protected one of the wings of {%Bhīmasena;%} there
<div n="lb">was nobody on earth, save {%Bhīma%} and {%Sātyaki,%} who was
<div n="lb">dearer to {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} than his very life; they beheld
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki%} at a distance; and that [grand]son of {%Śini%} took
<div n="lb">up the wing of both {%Bhīma%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Bhīma%}
<div n="lb">caused a bloody river to flow there. (14) {%Bhīṣma%} heard
<div n="lb">the cries, attacked {%Bhīma,%} and was attacked by {%Sātyaki,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Bhīṣma%} jumped from his chariot, mace in hand,
<div n="lb">and was taken by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} on his chariot. {%Sātyaki%}
<div n="lb">slew the charioteer of {%Bhīṣma,%} who was then carried away
<div n="lb">from the field of battle by his steeds. The {%Kaliṅgas%} were
<div n="lb">totally routed by {%Bhīma,%} who was praised by the {%Pāñcālas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Matsyas,%} himself embraced {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} and was con-
<div n="lb">gratulated by {%Sātyaki,%} who returned to his own chariot and
<div n="lb">began to slay the {%Kurus%} (VI, {@54@}). (15) When the forenoon
<div n="lb">of that day had passed away, {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} engaged in battle
<div n="lb">with {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he slew the steeds of {%Aśvatthāman,%}
<div n="lb">who got up on {%Śalya's%} car. (16) {%Abhimanyu%} quickly came
<div n="lb">up and wounded {%Śalya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), but was, in his turn, wounded
<div n="lb">by {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). (17) {%Lakṣmaṇa%} (the son of {%Duryo-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhana%}) attacked {%Abhimanyu.%} (18) {%Duryodhana%} attacked {%Abhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%manyu%} in order to aid {%Lakṣmaṇa.%} (19) {%Arjuna%} engaged in
<div n="lb">battle with the {%Kurus,%} headed by {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa;%} dust and
<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu's%} arrows produced complete darkness. The {%Kurus%}
<div n="lb">were routed. {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} blew their conches. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">suggested to {%Droṇa%} that they should withdraw the troops,
<div n="lb">and as the sun set both armies were withdrawn (VI, {@55@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 580: THIRD DAY; (1) Next morning {%Bhīṣma%} formed a
<div n="lb">{%Garuḍa%} array; at its beak was {%Bhīṣma%} himself; its eyes were
<div n="lb">formed by {%Droṇa%} and {%Kṛtavarman; Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were
<div n="lb">at its head; {%Bhūriśravas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were placed in its neck;
<div n="lb">at its back was {%Duryodhana%} and his followers; {%Vinda,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>), formed its tail; the {%Magadhas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), formed the right
<div n="lb">wing; the {%Kārūṣas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were stationed in the left wing.
<div n="lb">(2) {%Arjuna%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} formed an array in the
<div n="lb">shape of a half-moon, with {%Bhīmasena%} in the right horn, etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>); next to {%Nīla Dhṛṣṭaketu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); in the middle was
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); on the left horn was he who had
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} for his protector. Then the battle commenced
<div n="lb">(VI, {@56@}). (3) {%Arjuna%} fought with the {%Kauravas,%} who could
<div n="lb">not be broken, as they were protected by {%Droṇa;%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} could not be broken, as they were protected by
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīma.%} At last {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), broke the ranks
<div n="lb">of the {%Pāṇḍavas. Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked the {%Kauravas%}
<div n="lb">and fought with {%Duryodhana, Bhīṣma,%} and {%Droṇa; Abhimanyu%}
<div n="lb">and {%Sātyaki%} attacked {%Śakuni%} (VI, {@57@}). D., Dā., G., Pś., U.,
<div n="lb">and Rā. eulogized {%Arjuna.%} (4) The {%Gāndhāras,%} with {%Śakuni,%}
<div n="lb">fought with {%Sātyaki%} (the {%Vṛṣṇi%} hero) and {%Abhimanyu,%} and
<div n="lb">destroyed the chariot of {%Sātyaki,%} who mounted {%Abhimanyu's%}
<div n="lb">chariot. (5) {%Droṇa%} and {%Bhīṣma%} attacked {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and
<div n="lb">were attacked by him and the sons of {%Mādrī.%} (6) {%Bhīmasena%}
<div n="lb">and {%Ghaṭotkaca%} fought with {%Duryodhana,%} who was brought
[Page142-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">away by his charioteer, and his troops fled, pursued by
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma.%} (7) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} slew {%Droṇa's%}
<div n="lb">and {%Bhīṣma's%} army, which fled and could not be checked by
<div n="lb">by {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa.%} (8) {%Abhimanyu%} and {%Śaineya%} began
<div n="lb">to slaughter the army of {%Śakuni.%} (9) {%Arjuna%} routed the
<div n="lb">{%Kaurava%} army, and its flight could not be checked by
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa,%} but was checked by {%Duryodhana,%} who
<div n="lb">blamed {%Bhīṣma,%} saying that he did not sincerely fight with
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} otherwise his troops could not have been
<div n="lb">routed while {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), were alive; had he known this
<div n="lb">unwillingness of {%Bhīṣma%} to fight, he would have consulted
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa. Bhīṣma%} said that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were incapable of
<div n="lb">being vanquished by the very gods, including {%Indra,%} but he
<div n="lb">alone would check them to-day (VI, {@58@}). (10) After the
<div n="lb">forenoon of that day had passed away, {%Bhīṣma%} attacked the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} and a dreadful battle ensued, in which the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">were routed. {%Kṛṣṇa%} told {%Arjuna%} to strike {%Bhīṣma,%} reminding
<div n="lb">him of his vow to slay all the warriors of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} son,
<div n="lb">headed by {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa.%} At the request of {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇa%} drove the steeds to where {%Bhīṣma%} was, and the army
<div n="lb">of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} rallied for battle. {%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">fought; {%Kṛṣṇa%} displayed great skill in driving the horses;
<div n="lb">he and {%Arjuna%} were both wounded by {%Bhīṣma,%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍava%} army was routed; {%Bhīṣma%} ordered {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), to
<div n="lb">attack {%Arjuna.%} (11) The grandson of {%Śini%} came to {%Arjuna's%}

<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa,%} etc., he jumped down from the chariot with
<div n="lb">his discus {%Sudarśana%} in his hand, and rushed towards {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">(who welcomed him), but was held back by {%Arjuna,%} who said
<div n="lb">that he would himself slay the {%Kurus;%} he was then prevailed
<div n="lb">upon to mount the chariot once more, where he blew the
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcajanya,%} while arrows were shot from the {%Gāṇḍīva%} in all
<div n="lb">directions. (12) Then {%Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Arjuna,%}
<div n="lb">who invoked the {%Māhendra%} weapon and checked the {%Kaurava%}
<div n="lb">host. (13) {%Virāṭa, Drupada,%} etc., approached. {%Arjuna%} caused
<div n="lb">a river of blood to flow there with {%Rākṣasas%} on its banks.
<div n="lb">Elated with victory, the {%Cedis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), set up a loud shout.
<div n="lb">The {%Kurus,%} including {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), got afraid of the {%Indra-%}
<div n="lb">weapon, and withdrew their forces at sunset. The same did
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna.%} Among the {%Kurus%} there was a great uproar: “The
<div n="lb">{%Sauvīras,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), have all been slain by {%Arjuna,%} and he has
<div n="lb">vanquished {%Śrutāyus,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)” (VI, {@59@}).—§ 581: THE
<div n="lb">FOURTH DAY: (1) When the night had passed away, {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">at the head of the army proceeded against the foe, surrounded
<div n="lb">by {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). The array of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} was like that
<div n="lb">of the day before. {%Bhīṣma (b)%} attacked {%Arjuna,%} and so
<div n="lb">did {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Abhimanyu%} rushed out of the ranks
<div n="lb">and proceeded against all the foes, but {%Bhīṣma%} avoided
<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu%} and fought against {%Arjuna%} himself (VI, {@60@}).
<div n="lb">(2) {%Aśvatthāman,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), fought with {%Abhimanyu.%} (3) Urged
<div n="lb">by {%Duryodhana,%} the {%Trigartas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Arjuna%}
<div n="lb">and {%Abhimanyu.%} (4) Proceeding towards {%Arjuna, Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna%} attacked the {%Madras,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), and slew {%Saṃyamani's%}

<div n="lb">{%Abhimanyu%} attacked {%Śalya. Duryodhana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), protected
<div n="lb">the chariot of {%Śalya. Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), fought with them. (6)
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena,%} with his mace, attacked {%Duryodhana,%} who advanced

<div n="lb">before himself, {%Bhīmasena%} jumped from his chariot and slew the
<div n="lb">elephants with his mace; the {%Draupadeyas,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), protected
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma's%} rear; {%Abhimanyu%} slew the {%Magadha%} king after
<div n="lb">having slain his elephant (VI, {@62@}). (7) {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">commanded his entire army to slay {%Bhīmasena,%} who crushed
[Page142-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">them with his mace, without being abandoned by {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
<div n="lb">{%dyumna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). (8) {%Bhīṣma%} attacked {%Bhīmasena.%} (9) {%Sātyaki%}
<div n="lb">{%(Śinipravīraḥ)%} attacked {%Bhīṣma.%} (10) Only the Rā. {%Alambuṣa%}
<div n="lb">fought with the grandson of {%Śini.%} (11) Only {%Somadatta's%} son
<div n="lb">{%Bhūriśravas%} was then of good cheer; he attacked {%Sātyaki%}
<div n="lb">(VI, {@63@}). (12) {%Duryodhana%} and his brothers surrounded
<div n="lb">{%Somadatta's%} son; {%Bhīmasena%} encountered the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%}
<div n="lb">who were headed by {%Duryodhana; Nandaka%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra)
<div n="lb">also attacked {%Bhīmasena,%} who addressed his charioteer {%Viśoka,%}
<div n="lb">that he should drive the steeds with care; {%Duryodhana%} also
<div n="lb">wounded {%Viśoka; Duryodhana%} struck {%Bhīmasena%} so that he
<div n="lb">swooned away. (13) The {%Pāṇḍava%} army, headed by {%Abhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%manyu,%} showered arrows on {%Duryodhana; Bhīmasena%} regained
<div n="lb">consciousness and fought against {%Duryodhana%} and {%Śalya,%}
<div n="lb">who was borne away from the battle. (14) Fourteen
<div n="lb">{%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} viz. {%Senāpati,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), encountered {%Bhīma-%}
<div n="lb">{%sena,%} who slew {%Senāpati,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); the remaining six fled.
<div n="lb">(15) Urged by {%Bhīṣma,%} the whole {%Dhārtarāṣṭra%} army
<div n="lb">attacked {%Bhīmasena;%} the {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} king {%Bhagadatta,%} on
<div n="lb">a huge elephant, struck {%Bhīmasena,%} who fell in a swoon.
<div n="lb">(16) Then the Rā. {%Ghaṭotkaca,%} by help of his illusive force,
<div n="lb">appeared riding on an {%Airāvata,%} followed by the other {%Dig-%}
<div n="lb">{%nāgas%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>), each with four tusks and mounted by {%Rākṣasas,%}
<div n="lb">and attacked {%Bhagadatta's%} elephant. (17) {%Bhīṣma%} urged
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa%} and {%Duryodhana%} to rescue {%Bhagadatta;%} all the kings,
<div n="lb">headed by {%Droṇa,%} proceeded to aid {%Bhagadatta; Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">with the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas,%} pursued them from behind;
<div n="lb">{%Ghaṭotkaca%} uttered a flerce roar; {%Bhīṣma,%} addressing {%Droṇa,%}
<div n="lb">caused the army to withdraw, and so did the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
<div n="lb">{%Bhīmasena%} and {%Ghaṭotkaca. Duryodhana%} was afflicted with
<div n="lb">sorrow (VI, {@64@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained to {%Sañjaya,%} and
<div n="lb">asked what was the cause of the victory of the {%Pāṇḍavas.%}
<div n="lb">{%Sañjaya%} explained that victory sides with righteousness,
<div n="lb">and related how {%Duryodhana%} in the night had enquired of
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma,%} on whom the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were relying to vanquish
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Bhīṣma%} had related this ancient history:
<div n="lb">In days of old all the gods and {%Ṛṣis%} were assembled by
<div n="lb">{%Brahmán%} upon {%Gandhamādana;%} and when {%Brahmán,%} together
<div n="lb">with the {%Ṛṣis%} and gods, beheld an excellent chariot in the
<div n="lb">sky, he hymned {%Nārāyaṇa%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “…Therefore take birth
<div n="lb">in the race of {%Yadu%} and slay the sons of {%Diti…%} Having
<div n="lb">created the divine {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%} out of thy own self by thyself,
<div n="lb">thou didst then, O {%Kṛṣṇa,%} create thyself as {%Pradyumna,%} born
<div n="lb">of thyself; from {%Pradyumna%} thou didst then create {%Ani-%}
<div n="lb">{%ruddha,%} who is known as the eternal {%Viṣṇu;%} and it was
<div n="lb">{%Aniruddha%} who created me as {%Brahmán,%} the upholder of the
<div n="lb">Universe. Created out of {%Vāsudeva,%} I have therefore been
<div n="lb">created by thee. Dividing thyself into portions, take birth
<div n="lb">among human beings, and slaughtering the {%Asuras%} there
<div n="lb">…thou wilt again truly attain to {%Yoga…”%} (VI, {@65@}).
<div n="lb">Requested by D., R., and G., {%Brahmán%} explained to them who
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} is. “Those Dai. and Dā. and Rā. who were slain
<div n="lb">in battle have been born among men.” The old {%Ṛṣis Nara%} and
<div n="lb">{%Nārāyaṇa%} are {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa%} should never be
<div n="lb">disregarded as if he were a man. This was heard by {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">from {%Ṛṣis,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). “Never go to war with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} on account of thy folly thou couldst not appre-
<div n="lb">hend this; I regard thee, therefore, as a wicked {%Rākṣasa.%}”
<div n="lb">“Where {%Kṛṣṇa%} is, there is righteousness; and victory is
<div n="lb">where righteousness is…It is {%Kṛṣṇa%} who always
<div n="lb">imparts an understanding endued with righteousness and
<div n="lb">strength in battle to the {%Pāṇḍavas,%} and who always protects
<div n="lb">them from danger…He it is who, towards the close
[Page143-a+ 62]
<div n="lb">of the {%Dvāpara yuga%} and the beginning of the {%Kali yuga,%}
<div n="lb">is hymned by {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%} according to the {%Sātvata%} ritual”
<div n="lb">(VI, {@66@}). {%Bhīṣma,%} on the authority of {%Mārkaṇḍeya,%} declared
<div n="lb">the origin and glory of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} his deeds and creations, to
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (VI, {@67@}). {%Bhīṣma%} cited a hymn to {%Nārāyaṇa,%}
<div n="lb">uttered by {%Brahmán%} himself, and communicated in days of
<div n="lb">old by B.-ṛ. and G. on earth. {%Brahmán,%} who quoted {%Nārada,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), hymned {%Nārāyaṇa%} as the god of D., S. etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">(VI, {@68@}).—§ 582: FIFTH DAY: After the night had passed
<div n="lb">away, {%Bhīṣma%} proceeded in a {%Makara%} array, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in
<div n="lb">a {%Śyena%} array, in whose beak, etc., was {%Bhīmasena,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">(1) {%Bhīmasena,%} penetrating the {%Makara%} array through its
<div n="lb">mouth, attacked {%Bhīṣma;%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were confounded.
<div n="lb">(2) Then {%Arjuna%} attacked {%Bhīṣma.%} (3) {%Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">addressed {%Droṇa,%} who attacked {%Sātyaki%} (the grandson of {%Śini%}).
<div n="lb">(4) {%Bhīmasena%} attacked {%Droṇa%} in order to protect {%Sātyaki.%}
<div n="lb">(5) {%Droṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Bhīmasena.%} (6) {%Abhimanyu%}
<div n="lb">and the {%Draupadeyas%} attacked the {%Kurus; Śikhaṇḍin%} attacked
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa; Bhīṣma%} avoided him. (7) Urged by
<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana, Droṇa%} protected {%Bhīṣma; Śikhaṇḍin%} avoided
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa.%} (8) {%Duryodhana%} protected {%Bhīṣma,%} who was attacked
<div n="lb">by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with {%Arjuna%} at their head (VI, {@69@}). An awful
<div n="lb">carnage ensued. (9) {%Duryodhana%} and the {%Kāliṅgas%} placed
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} at their head and attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas;%} the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas,%} supporting {%Bhīma,%} attacked {%Bhīṣma%} (VI, {@70@}).
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna (b)%} attacked {%Bhīṣma%} with the {%Gāṇḍīva (c);%} the {%Kurus%}
<div n="lb">were afraid and seemed to melt away. (10) Then, with steeds
<div n="lb">of the {%Kāmboja%} breed, the {%Kāliṅga%} king, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), surrounded
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni. Bhīṣma,%} etc., fought with {%Arjuna,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Drupada,%}
<div n="lb">etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), fought with {%Droṇa; Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} attacked
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (VI, {@71@}). {%Arjuna%} encountered {%Droṇa,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Sātyaki,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>), attacked {%Śālva%} and the {%Kaikeyas.%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛṣṭaketu%} and {%Ghaṭotkaca%} attacked the chariot-division of
<div n="lb">the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras. Bhīṣma%} checked {%Bhīmasena. Sātyaki%}
<div n="lb">{%(Yuyudhāna)%} attacked {%Bhīṣma,%} but had his charioteer slain.
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} slew the {%Pāṇḍava%} forces; but the {%Pāñcālas%} and the
<div n="lb">{%Somakas%} again attacked {%Bhīṣma.%} (11) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna,%} etc.,
<div n="lb">attacked {%Bhīṣma; Bhīṣma, Droṇa,%} etc., attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
<div n="lb">(VI, {@72@}).

<div n="lb">attacked {%Abhimanyu,%} and so did {%Lakṣmaṇa%} (grandson of
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}), who had his steeds and charioteer slain, and
<div n="lb">was carried away by {%Kṛpa%} on his chariot. The {%Sṛñjayas%}
<div n="lb">fought with the {%Kurus%} with their fists; {%Bhīṣma%} slew the
<div n="lb">troops of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with his celestial weapons (VI, {@73@}).
<div n="lb">(13) {%Sātyaki (Yuyudhāna)%} slew innumerable foes with his
<div n="lb">arrows; {%Duryodhana%} despatched 10,000 chariots against
<div n="lb">him, but he destroyed them all with his celestial weapons.
<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki & Bhūriśravas (d); Sātyaki's%} combatants fled and
<div n="lb">abandoned him; ten sons of {%Yuyudhāna & Bhūriśravas%}
<div n="lb">(son of {%Bāhlīka's%} son {%Somadatta%}) towards the afternoon;
<div n="lb">{%Bhūriśravas%} slew them; {%Sātyaki & Bhūriśravas,%} each of

<div n="lb">{%Sātyaki%} up on his own chariot, and {%Duryodhana Bhūriśravas%}
<div n="lb">on his. (14) The {%Pāṇḍavas & Bhīṣma; Duryodhana%}
<div n="lb">urged 25,000 to slay {%Arjuna,%} who, however, slew them
<div n="lb">all. The {%Matsyas%} and {%Kekayas%} surrounded {%Arjuna%} and

[Page143-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">passed away, the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} once more set
<div n="lb">out for battle. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to
<div n="lb">dispose the troops in the {%Makara%} array: {%Drupada%} and
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} = head; {%Sahadeva%} and {%Nakula%} = two eyes; {%Bhīma-%}
<div n="lb">{%sena%} = beak; {%Abhimanyu,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) = neck; {%Virāṭa%} and

<div n="lb">{%Śatānīka%} = two feet; {%Śikhaṇḍin,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) = tail. {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">disposed his army in the form of a huge crane: {%Droṇa%}

<div n="lb">the {%Kauravas,%} mangled by {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@75@}).
<div n="lb">{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} recounted the excellency of the {%Kaurava%} army,

<div n="lb">he thought was due only to fate (or to the Creator); {%Vidura%}
<div n="lb">had spoken well, but the wicked {%Duryodhana%} would not

<div n="lb">{%Duryodhana: Duḥśāsana,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Bhīma%} left his chariot and
<div n="lb">took up his mace. (4) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (forsaking {%Droṇa%})
<div n="lb">proceeded towards {%Śakuni;%} seeing {%Bhīma's%} empty chariot, he
<div n="lb">became afflicted, but was comforted by the words of {%Viśoka;%}
<div n="lb">he took {%Bhīma,%} who was surrounded by foes on all sides,
