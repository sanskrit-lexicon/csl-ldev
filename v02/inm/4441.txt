[{@Hastikūṭa@}]¦ (“the artifice concerning the elephant”). § 757{%b%}
<div n="lb">(Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: A brahman {%Gautama%} nursed
<div n="lb">an infant elephant that had lost its mother, till it was ten
<div n="lb">years old, huge as a hill, etc.; he looked upon it as a son,
<div n="lb">and it brought him his fuel and water. {%Indra,%} in the shape
<div n="lb">of king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} seized this young elephant, offering to
<div n="lb">give to {%Gautama%} great riches instead; “what use can
<div n="lb">brahmans have of elephants?” (†vv. 4850 and 4852—86).
<div n="lb">{%Gautama%} said he would take the elephant from him even
<div n="lb">in {%[Yamaloka] (c), Mandākinī (d),%} the woods of {%Meru (e),%}
<div n="lb">{%Nandana (f), Uttarāḥ Kuravaḥ (g), [Somaloka] (h),%}
<div n="lb">{%[Sūryaloka] (i), [Varuṇaloka] (j), [Indraloka] (k), Prājā-%}
<div n="lb">{%patyāḥ lokāḥ (l), [Goloka] (m), Svayambhubhavana (n),%}
<div n="lb">(† vv. 4896—4902), the world of the {%Somapīthin%} ({%yatropayāti%}
<div n="lb">{%haribhiḥ somapīthī,%} B.; C. {%yatropayānti haribhiḥ somavīthīṃ%})
<div n="lb">{%(o); Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%} as regards {%c-k,%} said that he would go to
<div n="lb">higher regions, and as regards {%l-n,%} that he would not go (or
<div n="lb">be) there; having mentioned {%(o), Gautama%} recognized {%Indra;%}
<div n="lb">they asked each other's benediction; {%Indra%} returned the
<div n="lb">elephant, and as {%Gautama%} alone of all Ṛ. had been able to
<div n="lb">recognize him, he took {%Gautama%} and the elephant with him
<div n="lb">and proceeded to heaven *(XIII, {@102@}).
