[{@Nārada-Parvatopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode re-
<div n="lb">lating to Nārada and Parvata”). § 633{%b%} (Rājadh.):
<div n="lb">Ṛ. {%Nārada%} and his sister's son {%Parvata%} had in days of old
<div n="lb">left heaven for a pleasant ramble on earth in order to taste
<div n="lb">clarified butter and rice. They wandered under a compact
<div n="lb">of telling each other their inmost thoughts. They arrived
<div n="lb">at the court of {%Sṛñjaya (Śvaitya). Nārada%} was taken with the
<div n="lb">charms of {%Sṛñjaya's%} daughter {%Sukumārī;%} but shamefulness
<div n="lb">prevented him from disclosing his love to {%Parvata,%} who then
<div n="lb">cursed him for his reticence, saying that {%Sukumārī%} should
<div n="lb">become his wife, but then she and every man should behold
<div n="lb">him in the shape of an ape. {%Nārada%} cursed {%Parvata%} in return,
<div n="lb">saying that he should not succeed in proceeding to heaven.
<div n="lb">{%Parvata%} began to wander over the earth. {%Sukumārī%} beheld
<div n="lb">{%Nārada%} as an ape, but devoted herself entirely to him, and did
<div n="lb">not desire any D., Mu., or Y. for a husband. {%Nārada%} and
<div n="lb">{%Parvata,%} after some time, became reconciled and withdrew
<div n="lb">their mutual curses. {%Sukumārī%} fled, thinking {%Nārada%} to
<div n="lb">be somebody else, but was informed by {%Parvata. Parvata%}
<div n="lb">proceeded to heaven and {%Nārada%} to his home. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
<div n="lb">continued: “Ṛ. {%Nārada%} is here; he will tell thee everything
<div n="lb">that happened” (XII, {@30@}).
