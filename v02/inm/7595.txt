[{@Nārada-Parvatopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode re-
lating to Nārada and Parvata”). § 633{%b%} (Rājadh.):
Ṛ. {%Nārada%} and his sister's son {%Parvata%} had in days of old
left heaven for a pleasant ramble on earth in order to taste
clarified butter and rice. They wandered under a compact
of telling each other their inmost thoughts. They arrived
at the court of {%Sṛñjaya (Śvaitya). Nārada%} was taken with the
charms of {%Sṛñjaya's%} daughter {%Sukumārī%}; but shamefulness
prevented him from disclosing his love to {%Parvata%}, who then
cursed him for his reticence, saying that {%Sukumārī%} should
become his wife, but then she and every man should behold
him in the shape of an ape. {%Nārada%} cursed {%Parvata%} in return,
saying that he should not succeed in proceeding to heaven.
{%Parvata%} began to wander over the earth. {%Sukumārī%} beheld
{%Nārada%} as an ape, but devoted herself entirely to him, and did
not desire any D., Mu., or Y. for a husband. {%Nārada%} and
{%Parvata%}, after some time, became reconciled and withdrew
their mutual curses. {%Sukumārī%} fled, thinking {%Nārada%} to
be somebody else, but was informed by {%Parvata. Parvata%}
proceeded to heaven and {%Nārada%} to his home. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
continued: “Ṛ. {%Nārada%} is here; he will tell thee everything
that happened” (XII, {@30@}).
