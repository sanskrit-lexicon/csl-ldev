[{@Svargārohaṇaparvan@}¦ or {@°haṇikap°@}] (“the section
<div n="lb">relating to the ascension to heaven”, the 18th of the greater
<div n="lb">and the 100th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Svarga-
<div n="lb">parvan, Svargārohaṇika(ṃ) [parva(n)]. § 795. {%Janamejaya%}
<div n="lb">said: “Having attained to Heaven, what regions were
<div n="lb">respectively reached by my grandfathers, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
<div n="lb">the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras?%} Thou hast been taught everything by M-ṛ
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa.%}” {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: “Having arrived in Heaven,
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} beheld {%Duryodhana%} blazing with effulgence and
<div n="lb">seated in the midst of Sā.; he expressed his indignation (<lang n="greek"></lang>)
<div n="lb">and wished to come to his brothers; {%Nārada%} solicited him to
<div n="lb">desist from his wrath (<lang n="greek"></lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} indignantly (<lang n="greek"></lang>) asked
<div n="lb">for his brothers and {%Karṇa,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) (XVIII, {@1@}); {%Karṇa%}
<div n="lb">especially lay to him at heart, since his mother had ordered him
<div n="lb">to offer oblations of water unto {%Karṇa,%} and he had noticed
<div n="lb">the resemblance between the feet of his mother and those of
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa;%} he would not stay in Heaven if his brothers were
<div n="lb">not there. The gods ordered a celestial messenger to lead
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to the region reached by his brothers. The
[Page670-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">path was enveloped in darkness and stench, etc. (description);
<div n="lb">as he was about to turn back, he heard voices uttering piteous
<div n="lb">lamentations, calling him by name, and giving evidence to
<div n="lb">the happiness felt by his presence, and they turned out to
<div n="lb">come from {%Karṇa%} and his brothers, etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he could not
<div n="lb">understand this perverse order of things (<lang n="greek"></lang>); he censured the
<div n="lb">gods and {%Dharma,%} and declared that he would stay in Hell in
<div n="lb">order to comfort his relatives. The messenger returned and
<div n="lb">represented this to {%Indra%} (XVIII, {@2@}). All the gods: M.
<div n="lb">with {%Indra,%} V., A., Sā., R., Ā., Si., M-ṛ. and {%Dharma%} came
<div n="lb">to {%Yudhiṣṭhira;%} the illusions of Hell (the river {%Vaitaraṇī,%}
<div n="lb">etc.) disappeared; {%Indra%} informed him that Hell should be
<div n="lb">seen by every king; he who first endures Hell must after-
<div n="lb">wards enjoy Heaven, and vice versa; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} must see
<div n="lb">Hell because he had deceived {%Droṇa%} in the matter of his son;
<div n="lb">similarly {%Bhīma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) had been shown Hell; but they
<div n="lb">have all been cleansed of their sins, and they had, as also
<div n="lb">{%Karṇa,%} attained to regions of felicity; D., G., and Aps.
<div n="lb">should wait upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira;%} his regions are far above
<div n="lb">those of kings and equal to those of {%Hariścandra,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb">{%Dharma%} said that this was the third test to which he had put
<div n="lb">him (<lang n="greek"></lang>). Having bathed in the celestial {%Gaṅgā,%} he left
<div n="lb">his human body and assumed a celestial form, and became
<div n="lb">divested of all his enmities and grief. Accompanied by
<div n="lb">{%Dharma%} and praised by M-ṛ, he reached that place where the
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras,%} freed from wrath, were
<div n="lb">enjoying each his respective status (XVIII, {@3@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%}
<div n="lb">praised by D., M., and Ṛ., proceeded to that place where the
<div n="lb">foremost ones of the {%Kurus%} were; he beheld {%Govinda%} (Kṛṣṇa)
<div n="lb">in his {%Brāhma-%}form (description), adored by {%Arjuna;%} in
<div n="lb">another place {%Karṇa%} in the company of {%Sūrya,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>); as
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to question {%Draupadī, Indra%} declared
<div n="lb">that she was {%Śrī,%} created for the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by {%Śiva;%} her five
<div n="lb">sons are G.; G-king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was his uncle {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra;%}
<div n="lb">{%Pāṇḍu%} frequently comes to {%Indra%} in his excellent chariot;
<div n="lb">{%Bhīṣma%} is now in the midst of V.; others walk with G. and
<div n="lb">Y., etc., or Gh. (XVIII, {@4@}). {%Janamejaya%} asked for what
<div n="lb">period {%Bhīṣma,%} etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>) remained in Heaven, and what
<div n="lb">became of them when the effect of their actions were
<div n="lb">exhausted. {%Sauti%} said: Thus questioned B-ṛ {%Vaiśampāyana%}
<div n="lb">with the permission of {%Vyāsa%} said: Everyone is not
<div n="lb">capable of returning to his own nature [i.e. final Emancipa-
<div n="lb">tion, PCR.] when his deeds cease to work [the meaning
<div n="lb">seems to be that some persons lose their individuality by
<div n="lb">being absorbed into some deity before final Emancipation,
<div n="lb">but the text itself is corrupt]; this is a mystery of
<div n="lb">the gods, explained by {%Vyāsa,%} who is omniscient; {%Bhīṣma%}
<div n="lb">attained to the state of V. [absorbed in V., not as a
<div n="lb">separate individual: {%sāyujya,%} not {%sālokya,%} PCR.]; therefore,
<div n="lb">now eight {%Vasus%} are seen; etc. (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Sauti%} then related the
<div n="lb">conclusion of {%Janamejaya's (b)%} snake-sacrifice. “I have now
<div n="lb">told thee everything that {%Vaiśampāyana%} narrated, at the
<div n="lb">command of {%Vyāsa,%} unto the king at his snake-sacrifice. It
<div n="lb">is a sacred tale, etc., composed by {%Vyāsa%}” (eulogy of {%Vyāsa%})
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>),*; eulogy, etc., of {%Mahābhārata (c)%} (XVIII, {@5-6@}).
