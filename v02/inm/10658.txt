[{@Svargārohaṇaparvan@}¦ or {@°haṇikap°@}] (“the section
relating to the ascension to heaven”, the 18th of the greater
and the 100th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Svarga-
parvan, Svargārohaṇika(ṃ) [parva(n)]. § 795. {%Janamejaya%}
said: “Having attained to Heaven, what regions were
respectively reached by my grandfathers, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras?%} Thou hast been taught everything by M-ṛ
{%Vyāsa%}.” {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: “Having arrived in Heaven,
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} beheld {%Duryodhana%} blazing with effulgence and
seated in the midst of Sā.; he expressed his indignation (<lang n="greek">α</lang>)
and wished to come to his brothers; {%Nārada%} solicited him to
desist from his wrath (<lang n="greek">β</lang>); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} indignantly (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>) asked
for his brothers and {%Karṇa%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>) (XVIII, {@1@}); {%Karṇa%}
especially lay to him at heart, since his mother had ordered him
to offer oblations of water unto {%Karṇa%}, and he had noticed
the resemblance between the feet of his mother and those of
{%Karṇa%}; he would not stay in Heaven if his brothers were
not there. The gods ordered a celestial messenger to lead
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to the region reached by his brothers. The
[Page670-a+ 63]
path was enveloped in darkness and stench, etc. (description);
as he was about to turn back, he heard voices uttering piteous
lamentations, calling him by name, and giving evidence to
the happiness felt by his presence, and they turned out to
come from {%Karṇa%} and his brothers, etc. (<lang n="greek">ε</lang>); he could not
understand this perverse order of things (<lang n="greek">ζ</lang>); he censured the
gods and {%Dharma%}, and declared that he would stay in Hell in
order to comfort his relatives. The messenger returned and
represented this to {%Indra%} (XVIII, {@2@}). All the gods: M.
with {%Indra%}, V., A., Sā., R., Ā., Si., M-ṛ. and {%Dharma%} came
to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; the illusions of Hell (the river {%Vaitaraṇī%},
etc.) disappeared; {%Indra%} informed him that Hell should be
seen by every king; he who first endures Hell must after-
wards enjoy Heaven, and vice versa; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} must see
Hell because he had deceived {%Droṇa%} in the matter of his son;
similarly {%Bhīma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">η</lang>) had been shown Hell; but they
have all been cleansed of their sins, and they had, as also
{%Karṇa%}, attained to regions of felicity; D., G., and Aps.
should wait upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; his regions are far above
those of kings and equal to those of {%Hariścandra%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>).
{%Dharma%} said that this was the third test to which he had put
him (<lang n="greek">ι</lang>). Having bathed in the celestial {%Gaṅgā%}, he left
his human body and assumed a celestial form, and became
divested of all his enmities and grief. Accompanied by
{%Dharma%} and praised by M-ṛ, he reached that place where the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, freed from wrath, were
enjoying each his respective status (XVIII, {@3@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
praised by D., M., and Ṛ., proceeded to that place where the
foremost ones of the {%Kurus%} were; he beheld {%Govinda%} (Kṛṣṇa)
in his {%Brāhma-%}form (description), adored by {%Arjuna%}; in
another place {%Karṇa%} in the company of {%Sūrya%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">κ</lang>); as
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to question {%Draupadī, Indra%} declared
that she was {%Śrī%}, created for the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by {%Śiva%}; her five
sons are G.; G-king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was his uncle {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%};
{%Pāṇḍu%} frequently comes to {%Indra%} in his excellent chariot;
{%Bhīṣma%} is now in the midst of V.; others walk with G. and
Y., etc., or Gh. (XVIII, {@4@}). {%Janamejaya%} asked for what
period {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (<lang n="greek">λ</lang>) remained in Heaven, and what
became of them when the effect of their actions were
exhausted. {%Sauti%} said: Thus questioned B-ṛ {%Vaiśampāyana%}
with the permission of {%Vyāsa%} said: Everyone is not
capable of returning to his own nature [i.e. final Emancipa-
tion, PCR.] when his deeds cease to work [the meaning
seems to be that some persons lose their individuality by
being absorbed into some deity before final Emancipation,
but the text itself is corrupt]; this is a mystery of
the gods, explained by {%Vyāsa%}, who is omniscient; {%Bhīṣma%}
attained to the state of V. [absorbed in V., not as a
separate individual: {%sāyujya%}, not {%sālokya%}, PCR.]; therefore,
now eight {%Vasus%} are seen; etc. (<lang n="greek">μ</lang>). {%Sauti%} then related the
conclusion of {%Janamejaya's (b%}) snake-sacrifice. “I have now
told thee everything that {%Vaiśampāyana%} narrated, at the
command of {%Vyāsa%}, unto the king at his snake-sacrifice. It
is a sacred tale, etc., composed by {%Vyāsa%}” (eulogy of {%Vyāsa%})
(<lang n="greek">ν</lang>),*; eulogy, etc., of {%Mahābhārata (c%}) (XVIII, {@5-6@}).
