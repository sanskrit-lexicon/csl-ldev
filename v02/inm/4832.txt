{@[Jaṭāsuravadhaparvan]@}¦ (“the section treating of the
killing of Jaṭāsura,” being the 37th of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.). (Cf. Jaṭāsuravadha.) § 435: One day, after the
{%Rākṣasas%} with {%Ghaṭotkaca%} had departed, while {%Bhīma%} was
[Page356-b+ 63]
a-hunting, and {%Lomaśa%} and the other ṛṣis had gone away to
bathe and collect flowers, the {%Rākṣasa Jaṭāsura%}, who had
followed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} in the guise of a brahman versed in all
the {%śāstras%}, with the object of possessing himself of the arms
of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and of {%Draupadī%}, began to flee away with
the arms and {%Draupadī%} and the three {%Pāṇḍavas. Sahadeva%}
extricated himself, and snatching the sword {%Kauśika%}, he
began to call {%Bhīmasena. Yudhiṣṭhira%} reproached him,
saying that the {%Rākṣasas%} are the root of virtue and know
virtue ({%dharmaṃ%}) best, and that the {%Rākṣasas%}, gods, {%Pitṛs%},
{%Siddhas, Ṛṣis, Gandharvas%}, etc., depend for their lives on
men, etc. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then made himself ponderous.
{%Sahadeva%} was about to attack the {%Rākṣasa%}, when {%Bhīma%}
appeared mace in hand. The {%Rākṣasa%} set them down, and
he and {%Bhīma%} began to fight with trees, like {%Vālin%} and
{%Sugrīva%}, and then with rocks, and at last by wrestling, till
{%Bhīma%}, having dealt a blow on the neck of the {%Rākṣasa%},
lifted him up, and dashed him on the ground and severed
his head from his body, and then presented himself before
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (III, {@157@}).
