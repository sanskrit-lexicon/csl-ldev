<div n="lb">{%(sāmrājye);%} (etymology of {%Pṛthu, kṣatriya,%} and {%rājan%}).
<div n="lb">During his time the earth yielded crops in sufficiency, etc.;
<div n="lb">the {%kuśa%} blades were all of gold, etc.; when king {%P.%} went to
<div n="lb">the sea, the waves became solid; the very mountains used to
<div n="lb">open before him that he might pass through them. Once
<div n="lb">the trees, the mountains, the gods, the Asuras, the men, the
<div n="lb">Uragas, the seven ṛṣis, the Yakṣas, the Apsarases, and
<div n="lb">the Pitṛs came to {%P.%} and calling him their emperor {%(samrāṭ),%}
<div n="lb">etc., asked boons from him. Taking his {%Ājagava%} bow, {%P.%}
<div n="lb">caused them to milk the Earth (whom he made his daughter)
<div n="lb">by means of a calf (A), a milker (B), and vessels (C) for
<div n="lb">various kinds of milk (D): (1) [the trees]: the śāla-tree

<div n="lb">a gourd (C), poison (D). (7) The seven ṛṣis: {%Soma%} (A),
<div n="lb">{%Bṛhaspati%} (B), {%chandas%} (C), the Vedas (D). (8) The Yakṣas:
<div n="lb">{%Vṛṣadhvaja%} (A), {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e. Kubera) (B), an unbaked

<div n="lb">(C), {%svadhā%} (D). “To this day the creatures exist in the
<div n="lb">same way.” {%P.%} caused golden images to be made of every
<div n="lb">article on earth and bestowed them all on the brahmans at
<div n="lb">his great horse-sacrifice, also 66,000 elephants of gold; also
<div n="lb">the whole world (VII, {@69@}): VII, {@69,@} 2394 {%(Vaiṇyaṃ),%}

<div n="lb">{%(Vainyaṃ),%} 1031, 1032 ({%Vainyaṃ,%} repetition from § 595).—
<div n="lb">§ 641{%f%} (cf. Vena). When {%P.%} had sprung from the right hand
<div n="lb">of Vena, the M.-ṛ., R., and the gods told him to observe
<div n="lb">righteousness and punish the wicked, etc. {%Śukra%} became
<div n="lb">his priest, the {%Vālakhilyas%} his counsellors, the {%Sārasvatas%} his
<div n="lb">companions {%(Sārasvatyo gaṇas tathā),%} the M.-ṛ. {%Garga%} became
<div n="lb">his astrologer {%(sāṃvatsaraḥ); Sūta%} and {%Māgadha%} (who came
<div n="lb">into existence before {%P.%}) became his panegyrists, he gave
<div n="lb">to {%Sūta%} the land lying on the sea-coast {%(Anūpadeśaṃ),%} to
<div n="lb">{%Māgadha Magadha. P.%} made the earth even (in every
<div n="lb">manvantara the earth becomes uneven), removing the rocks
<div n="lb">lying around with the horn of his bow; by this means the
<div n="lb">hills and the mountains became enlarged. Then {%Viṣṇu,%} etc.
<div n="lb">(<lang n="greek"></lang>) crowned {%P.%} and gave him rich gifts; steeds, chariots,
<div n="lb">etc., came into existence as soon as {%P.%} thought of them.
[Page565-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">At this time there was neither decrepitude nor famine,
<div n="lb">etc., nobody had any fear from reptiles and thieves, etc.;
<div n="lb">when he proceeded to the sea, the waters used to be solidified,
<div n="lb">the mountains granted him passage, etc. He drew from the
<div n="lb">earth as a milker from a cow seventeen kinds of crops for
<div n="lb">the {%Y., Rā.,%} and {%N.,%} etc. He caused all creatures to regard
<div n="lb">righteousness as the foremost of all things; he was called
<div n="lb">{%rājan%} (etymology) and {%kṣatriya%} (etymology), etymology of
<div n="lb">the name Pṛthivī. {%Viṣṇu%} confirmed his power and entered
<div n="lb">his body in consequence of his penances; for this reason the
<div n="lb">entire universe bows to the king as to a god. At this time
<div n="lb">a gold lotus was born from {%Viṣṇu's%} brow, from that lotus
<div n="lb">was born the goddess {%Śrī,%} who became the spouse of {%Dharma%}
<div n="lb">(“righteousness”); their son was {%Artha%} (“profit”); all the
<div n="lb">three were established in sovereignty. The king is really
<div n="lb">a portion of Viṣṇu on earth. He who once beheld his
<div n="lb">{%(P.'s?)%} amiable face became (becomes?) obedient to him:
