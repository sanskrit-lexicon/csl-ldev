{@Yāja@},¦ a Brahmarṣi, brother of Upayāja. § 218{%b%} (Draupadī-
sambhava): {%Drupada%} saw the two brothers of Kaśyapa's
race, {%Y%}. and {%Upayāja%}. He courted {%Upayāja%} and asked him
to perform a sacrifice, by which he might obtain a son who
might slay {%Droṇa%}, and promised him an {%arbuda%} of kine. But
{%Upayāja%} refused. {%Drupada%} once more began to pay homage
to him, and after a year {%Upayāja%} said that his elder brother,
{%Y.%}, once had taken up a fruit without inquiring of the purity
of the spot, and had, in the house of his preceptor, used to
eat the remains of other people's feasts; he would entertain
no scruples. Describing the might of {%Droṇa%} (“{%Droṇa%} is also
skilled in the {%Brahmāstra%}, his bow is six {%aratnis%} long”)
{%Drupada%} promised {%Y%}. to give him eight {%ayutas%} (cf. v. 6385:
“an {%arbuda%}”) of kine. {%Y%}. consented and prevailed upon
{%Upayāja%} to assist him. {%Upayāja%} then spoke to Drupada of
everything required for the sacrifice: I, {@167@}, 6362 ({%°opayājau%}
{%Brahmarṣī%}), 6376 ({%°syāśramaṃ%}), 6377, 6386.—§ 218 (do.):
I, {@167@}, 6390, 6391 (6392), 6393, 6405, 6406 (in the
sacrifice which {%Y%}. and Upayāja performed for Drupada,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Draupadī were born from the sacrificial
fire).—§ 306 (Anudyūtap.): II, {@80@}, 2662 ({%°opayājatapasā%}
{%lebhe putraṃ sa pāvakāt%}, sc. Drupada, all. to § 218). Cf.
Kāśyapa, dual.
