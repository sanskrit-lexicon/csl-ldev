{@Yāja,@}¦ a Brahmarṣi, brother of Upayāja. § 218{%b%} (Draupadī-
<div n="lb">sambhava): {%Drupada%} saw the two brothers of Kaśyapa's
<div n="lb">race, {%Y.%} and {%Upayāja.%} He courted {%Upayāja%} and asked him
<div n="lb">to perform a sacrifice, by which he might obtain a son who
<div n="lb">might slay {%Droṇa,%} and promised him an {%arbuda%} of kine. But
<div n="lb">{%Upayāja%} refused. {%Drupada%} once more began to pay homage
<div n="lb">to him, and after a year {%Upayāja%} said that his elder brother,
<div n="lb">{%Y.,%} once had taken up a fruit without inquiring of the purity
<div n="lb">of the spot, and had, in the house of his preceptor, used to
<div n="lb">eat the remains of other people's feasts; he would entertain
<div n="lb">no scruples. Describing the might of {%Droṇa%} (“{%Droṇa%} is also
<div n="lb">skilled in the {%Brahmāstra,%} his bow is six {%aratnis%} long”)
<div n="lb">{%Drupada%} promised {%Y.%} to give him eight {%ayutas%} (cf. v. 6385:
<div n="lb">“an {%arbuda%}”) of kine. {%Y.%} consented and prevailed upon
<div n="lb">{%Upayāja%} to assist him. {%Upayāja%} then spoke to Drupada of
<div n="lb">everything required for the sacrifice: I, {@167,@} 6362 {%(°opayājau%}

<div n="lb">sacrifice which {%Y.%} and Upayāja performed for Drupada,
<div n="lb">Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Draupadī were born from the sacrificial
<div n="lb">fire).—§ 306 (Anudyūtap.): II, {@80,@} 2662 ({%°opayājatapasā%}
