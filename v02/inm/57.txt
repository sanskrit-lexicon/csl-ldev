kṣattriya, vaiśya, or śūdra may, after having fasted at
a śrāddha, after the setting of the sun, deposit an offering of
black clothes and unguents with flowers in an ant-hill,
begging the serpents to hand it over to the world-elephants

strength of Viṣṇu, when he lifted up Earth; the formula
is contained in vv. 7163—6; this he should do for a
whole year.
