[{@Vicitravīryasutotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“begetting of sons for
Vicitravīrya”). § 171 (cf. Bhīṣma-Satyavatī-saṃvāda).
{%Satyavatī%} related to {%Bhīṣma%} the birth of {%Dvaipāyana%}
(cf. § 77; from the darkness of his skin he is also called
{%Kṛṣṇa%} (v. 4236)), who instantly came when {%Kālī%} (i.e. Satya-
vatī) thought of him, and promised to raise offspring in the
widows of {%Vicitravīrya%}. As there was no time for them to
observe a rigid vow for one full year, he ordered that they
should tolerate his ugliness. {%Satyavatī%} first addressed herself
to {%Kausalyā%} (i.e. Ambikā) and fed {%brahmans, devarṣis%}, and
guests (I, {@105@}). {%Ambikā%}, seeing {%Vyāsa%}, closed her eyes in
fear; therefore her son, though he was destined to be mighty,
etc., and to have 100 sons, had to be blind. After his
(i.e. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}) birth, {%Vyāsa%} approached {%Ambālikā%}, who
became pale with fear; therefore, her son was pale and was
named {%Pāṇḍu. Ambālikā%} refused to receive {%Vyāsa%} again and
sent him a {%śūdra%} maid of hers, adorned with her own
ornaments; on her he begat {%Vidura%}, who was {%Dharma%}, born
under the curse of {%Māṇḍavya. Vyāsa%} then disappeared
(I, {@106@}).
