[{@Bhaṅgāsvanopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
to Bhaṅgāsvana”). § 728{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: In
days of yore lived R.-ṛ. {%Bhaṅgāsvana%}, who, being childless, from
desire of obtaining issue performed the {%Agniṣṭuta%}, that is
disliked by {%Indra%}, but is approved of by men desirous of
offspring, in order to purge themselves of their sins
({%prāyaścitteṣu%}, v. the note of PCR., p. 44). He had 100
sons. {%Indra%} began to look for an occasion against him.
Once, on a hunting expedition, he was bewildered by {%Indra%},
and, afflicted with thirst, he plunged into a lake after having
caused his horse to drink, and found himself changed into
a woman. He took leave of his wives and children and
retired to the woods, joined an ascetic and bore him 100 sons,
whom he took to his former children, and made them all enjoy
the kingdom as their joint property. Filled with rage, {%Indra%},
in the form of a brahman, repaired to {%Bhaṅgāsvana's%} capital,
and, referring them to the example of the gods and the {%Asuras%}
(the children of {%Kaśyapa%}), caused the half-brothers to slay
each other. Then, in the form of a brahman, he came to
the spot where {%Bhaṅgāsvana%} lived as an ascetic lady, afflicted
with grief, and told him that he was {%Indra%}, and why he was
[Page119-b+ 63]
angry, but was gratified and granted him a boon. He asked
that those sons of his should revive that were born by him
as a woman, because the affection entertained by a woman
is much greater than that which is entertained by a man.
{%Indra%} revived all his children, and told him to choose which-
ever sex he liked, that of woman or that of man. He chose
to remain a woman, because in sexual intercourse the pleasure
that women enjoy is always much greater than what is
enjoyed by men. {%Indra%} proceeded to heaven (XIII, {@12@}).
