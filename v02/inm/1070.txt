{@Badarapācana@}¦ (a tīrtha on the Sarasvatī). § 615 (Bala-
<div n="lb">devat.): IX, {@47,@} 2760.—§ 615{%y:%} IX, {@48,@} 2762, 2793, 2812:
<div n="lb">There the beautiful {%Śrutāvatī, Bharadvāja's%} daughter, a {%brahma-%}
<div n="lb">{%cāriṇī,%} practised austerities for many years, desirous of obtaining
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} for her husband. {%Indra%} then came in the guise of
<div n="lb">B.-ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha,%} and told her that everything is attainable by
<div n="lb">penances, and asked her to boil five jujubes, when he went
<div n="lb">away to mentally recite certain {%mantras%} at {%Indratīrtha,%} that
<div n="lb">was not far away. She sat down to boil the jujubes, but in
<div n="lb">vain; the day was about to wane; her fuel was all consumed;
<div n="lb">then she first thrust her feet into the fire, without changing
<div n="lb">a muscle of her face. {%Indra%} then showed himself in his own
<div n="lb">proper form, and said that her wish would be accomplished;
<div n="lb">throwing off her body, she would live with him in heaven as
<div n="lb">his spouse; and this {%tīrtha%} would be the foremost in the world
<div n="lb">and be called {%B.;%} he granted her a boon superior to that
<div n="lb">granted to {%Arundhatī%} (<lang n="greek"></lang>) by {%Mahādeva:%} the person who will
<div n="lb">reside in this {%tīrtha%} for only one night and bathe there with
<div n="lb">his soul fixed on meditation, will, after having thrown off his
<div n="lb">body, obtain many regions of blessedness difficult of acquisition.
<div n="lb">Then {%Indra%} went back to heaven; a shower of celestial
<div n="lb">flowers poured down, etc., and {%Śrutāvatī,%} throwing off her
<div n="lb">body, became the spouse of {%Indra.%}—Cf. Badarīpācana.
