[{@Āraṇeyaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the wood for
producing fire by friction,” the 51st of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr. = ch. III, {@311—315@}). § 548: Asked by Janamejaya,
Vaiśampāyana related what the Pāṇḍavas did after having
rescued Kṛṣṇā (from Jayadratha). The Pāṇḍavas left
Kāmyaka and returned to Dvaitavana with Kṛṣṇā. Once
a deer carried off a brahman's araṇī and mantha, was pursued
by the Pāṇḍavas, and suddenly became invisible. Bhīma
repented that he had not slain the prātikāmin, Arjuna that he
had not slain Karṇa, and Sahadeva that he had not slain
Śakuni. Nakula, Sahadeva, Arjuna, and Bhīma were suc-
cessively sent to fetch water, but caused to drop down dead
by a Yakṣa. At last Yudhiṣṭhira himself went, answered
thirty-four questions put by the Yakṣa, chose that Nakula
should be revived, rescued all his brothers, learnt that the
Yakṣa was his father Dharma ({%c%}), was granted the boon that
the brahman would recover his araṇī and mantha, that the
Pāṇḍavas would manage to live the thirteenth year un-
recognized in Virāṭa's kingdom, and that Yudhiṣṭhira (who
was born of Dharma, as Vidura of a portion of Dharma)
should overcome covetousness, etc. The Pāṇḍavas asked
permission of the brahmans to live the thirteenth year in
concealment from the Dhārtarāṣṭras, Duryodhana, etc., and
Karṇa and Saubala. Dhaumya, etc., consoled Yudhiṣṭhira:
“Even the gods (Indra, {%d%}; Viṣṇu, {%e%}; Agni, {%f%}; Aurva, {%g%};
Vivasvat, {%h%}) have wandered in disguise for the purpose of
overcoming foes.” The brahmans (yatis, munis) went back
to their homes, and the Pāṇḍavas and Dhaumya set out with
Kṛṣṇā, and the next day proceeded for a krośa, and then sat
down in order to take counsel of each other.
