[{@Draupadīparitāpavākya(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the complaints of
<div n="lb">Draupadī”; cf. Arjunābhigamanaparvan). § 325: While they
<div n="lb">were conversing in the evening, filled with sorrow, {%Kṛṣṇā,%}
<div n="lb">who wondered at the hardheartedness of {%Duryodhana, Karṇa,%}
<div n="lb">{%Śakuni,%} and {%Duḥśāsana,%} who were the only four that did not
<div n="lb">shed tears at their being exiled, and who lameṇted their present
<div n="lb">state so different from their former happiness, tried to excite
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to revenge himself (III, {@27@}).—§ 326: {%Draupadī%}
<div n="lb">related the old story of the conversation between {%Prahlāda%}
<div n="lb">(the chief of the {%Asuras%} and the {%Dānavas,%} well versed in
<div n="lb">the mysteries of the science of duty) and his grandson {%Bali%}
<div n="lb">{%Vairocana,%} in which {%Prahlāda%} told {%Bali%} that neither might
<div n="lb">nor forgiveness is invariably meritorious, and then she said:
<div n="lb">“I therefore consider, O king! that time has come for thee
<div n="lb">to put forth thy might” (III, {@28@}).—§ 327: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
<div n="lb">maintained that a wise man should ever forgive his persecutor;
<div n="lb">that wrath has been given to man for the destruction of
<div n="lb">the world; and cited {%gāthās%} of the forgiving {%Kāśyapa:%}
<div n="lb">“Forgiveness is virtue, sacrifice, the {%Vedas,%} etc.; men of
<div n="lb">forgiveness obtain regions in the {%Brahmaloka;%} when one
<div n="lb">forgives everything, then he becomes {%bráhman (brahma%}
<div n="lb">{%sampadyate);%} this and the other world belongs to him who
<div n="lb">forgives, etc.” (III, {@29@}). From the fact that pious persons
<div n="lb">are often unhappy (v. 1133, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} is said to have
<div n="lb">performed the {%aśvamedha(!), rājasūya, puṇḍarīka,%} and {%gosava%}
<div n="lb">sacrifices) and vicious persons happy, {%Draupadī%} concludes
<div n="lb">that {%Dhātṛ%} and {%Vidhātṛ%} have clouded {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} senses,
<div n="lb">that it is folly to aspire to final emancipation {%(mokṣa),%} that
<div n="lb">the consequences of acts are inevitable, that God {%(Īśvara,%}
<div n="lb">{%Dhātṛ, Svayambhū Prapitāmaha)%} makes creatures to work
<div n="lb">as a wooden doll is made to move its limbs by a wire-puller,
<div n="lb">etc., and causes them to destroy each other, that God does
<div n="lb">not behave towards his creatures like a father or mother,
<div n="lb">but like a vicious person; either God is sinful, or Might (and
<div n="lb">not God) is the true cause of acts, and then those are to be
<div n="lb">pitied that have no might (III, {@30@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} censured
<div n="lb">{%Kṛṣṇā%} for her atheism {%(nāstikya),%} saying that one should
<div n="lb">not act virtuously from the desire of reaping fruits, but
[Page261-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">because it is ordained so by the {%Veda,%} the ancient religion
<div n="lb">revealed by the {%ṛṣis,%} and because it is the conduct of the
<div n="lb">good and wise; neither should one doubt virtue or religion
<div n="lb">nor censure God, by whose grace mortal man, by piety,
<div n="lb">acquires immortality. For though we may not see the
<div n="lb">results, being mysterious even to the gods, and the
<div n="lb">illusion {%(māyā)%} of the gods is mysterious to us, yet virtue
<div n="lb">and vice are not fruitless, as may be seen from the examples
<div n="lb">of {%Vyāsa, Vasiṣṭha, Maitreya, Nārada, Lomaśa, Śuka,%} and
<div n="lb">other {%ṛṣis,%} who by virtue have become superior even to the
<div n="lb">gods; as also from her own and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} birth; nor
<div n="lb">would men have practised virtue, generation after generation,
<div n="lb">if asceticism, etc., were useless, and no one would pursue
<div n="lb">salvation {%(nirvāṇa),%} but they would live like beasts, and
<div n="lb">why should {%ṛṣis,%} gods, {%Gandharvas, Rākṣasas,%} and {%Asuras,%}
<div n="lb">who are above human conditions {%(īśvarāḥ),%} cherish virtue?
<div n="lb">He who, trusting the proofs of his own reasoning, rejects
<div n="lb">other authority or doubts religion and virtue, loses this and
<div n="lb">yonder world, and is lower than even śūdras and robbers
<div n="lb">(III, {@31@}). {%Kṛṣṇā%} said that she did not slander religion
<div n="lb">nor disregard God {%(Īśvara, Prajāpati, Maheśvara);%} it was
<div n="lb">affliction that had extorted these words from her. She
<div n="lb">maintained that besides what a man obtains from Necessity
<div n="lb">{%(haṭha),%} Fate {%(daiva),%} Accident {%(svabhāva),%} and deeds in
<div n="lb">a former life {%(karman)%} (all of which might be reduced to the
<div n="lb">last item, also called {%adṛśya%}), which God distributes, there are
<div n="lb">also things of which man himself is the cause, working through
<div n="lb">his own intelligence and exertion. It is by exertion ({%utthāna;%}
<div n="lb">the explanation of Nīl. here seems to be inadmissible) that all
<div n="lb">creatures live, even {%Dhātṛ%} and {%Vidhātṛ,%} as well as the crane
<div n="lb">on the water. Those who believe only in Destiny {%(diṣṭa)%}
<div n="lb">or Necessity are both the meanest among men. On the other
<div n="lb">hand, if God were not the giver of good and bad fruits,
<div n="lb">there would not be any creature that was miserable, and
<div n="lb">all exertions would be successful. {%Manu%} himself declares
<div n="lb">that a man should act; and if he works, even if he be not
<div n="lb">successful, his debt is cancelled. “Having exerted thyself,
<div n="lb">thou wilt know what the fruit of thy exertions will be.
<div n="lb">The tiller tills the soil with the plough, and sows the seed
<div n="lb">thereon; he then sits silent, for the clouds are now the
<div n="lb">cause; and if no rain favours him, the tiller is without
<div n="lb">blame…If, however, no exertion is made, there can
<div n="lb">be no success…All this, uttered by {%Bṛhaspati%} himself,
<div n="lb">a learned brahman said to my father and my brothers; from
<div n="lb">them I heard it” (III, {@32@}). {%Bhīma%} tried to prevail upon
<div n="lb">{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that (especially as they had lost the sovereignty
<div n="lb">by his carelessness) he should make war with the {%Dhārta-%}
<div n="lb">{%rāṣṭras,%} aided by the {%Sṛñjayas%} and {%Kaikeyas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa,%}
<div n="lb">maintaining that a man should practise virtue {%(dharma)%}
<div n="lb">for the sake of gaining wealth {%(artha),%} and acquire wealth
<div n="lb">for the sake of pleasure {%(kāma),%} but neither for its own sake;
<div n="lb">that might and energy (and the protecting of the subjects)
<div n="lb">constitute the virtue of the {%Kṣatriya,%} and that deviation
<div n="lb">from the virtues of one's own order is never laudable;
<div n="lb">that the {%Asuras,%} though elder brothers in possession of
<div n="lb">power and abundance, were all vanquished by the gods
<div n="lb">through stratagem; that as wealth should be spent by one
<div n="lb">who wishes to increase his wealth, just as seeds are
<div n="lb">scattered on the ground, thus a person who throws away
<div n="lb">a little of his virtue like seeds {%(dharma)%} in order to gain
<div n="lb">a larger measure of virtue is regarded as wise, and that
<div n="lb">whatever sin a monarch commits in acquiring dominion,
<div n="lb">he cancels it all afterwards by sacrifices and by bestowing
[Page262-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">villages, etc., on brahmans (III, {@33@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} declared
<div n="lb">that he was unable to violate the pledge, and that it was
<div n="lb">now too late for {%Bhīma%} to use harsh words (III, {@34@}).
<div n="lb">{%Bhīma%} said that only he whose life is unlimited, or who
<div n="lb">knows what the period of his life is, has time to wait; they
<div n="lb">ought to strive for the possession of the kingdom before they
<div n="lb">died; “if a man, slaying his injurer, goes the very day into
<div n="lb">hell, that hell becomes heaven to him; the pain one feels
<div n="lb">in having to suppress his wrath is more burning than fire
<div n="lb">itself;…thou art kind like a brahman, how hast thou
<div n="lb">been born in the {%Kṣatriya%} order? those who are born in
<div n="lb">this order are generally of cruel hearts; thou hast heard the
<div n="lb">duties of kings, as promulgated by {%Manu,%} cruel and fraught
<div n="lb">with crookedness and opposed to tranquillity {%(śama);%}
<div n="lb">moreover, we will not be able to live unknown, as we are
<div n="lb">known all over the world, and many kings, who have been
<div n="lb">expelled by us from their kingdoms, and robbed and exiled
<div n="lb">by us, will assist {%Duryodhana%} and set against us numerous
<div n="lb">spies in disguise; we have now lived in the woods for
<div n="lb">thirteen months, which may be regarded as so many years,
<div n="lb">as {%pūtikas%} (see BR. and Nīl.) are a substitute for the {%soma;%}
<div n="lb">or one may free himself from this sin by offering food to
<div n="lb">a bull” (see Nīl.) (III, {@35@}).
