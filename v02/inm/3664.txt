[{@Draupadīparitāpavākya(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the complaints of
Draupadī”; cf. Arjunābhigamanaparvan). § 325: While they
were conversing in the evening, filled with sorrow, {%Kṛṣṇā%},
who wondered at the hardheartedness of {%Duryodhana, Karṇa%},
{%Śakuni%}, and {%Duḥśāsana%}, who were the only four that did not
shed tears at their being exiled, and who lameṇted their present
state so different from their former happiness, tried to excite
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to revenge himself (III, {@27@}).—§ 326: {%Draupadī%}
related the old story of the conversation between {%Prahlāda%}
(the chief of the {%Asuras%} and the {%Dānavas%}, well versed in
the mysteries of the science of duty) and his grandson {%Bali%}
{%Vairocana%}, in which {%Prahlāda%} told {%Bali%} that neither might
nor forgiveness is invariably meritorious, and then she said:
“I therefore consider, O king! that time has come for thee
to put forth thy might” (III, {@28@}).—§ 327: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
maintained that a wise man should ever forgive his persecutor;
that wrath has been given to man for the destruction of
the world; and cited {%gāthās%} of the forgiving {%Kāśyapa%}:
“Forgiveness is virtue, sacrifice, the {%Vedas%}, etc.; men of
forgiveness obtain regions in the {%Brahmaloka%}; when one
forgives everything, then he becomes {%bráhman (brahma%}
{%sampadyate%}); this and the other world belongs to him who
forgives, etc.” (III, {@29@}). From the fact that pious persons
are often unhappy (v. 1133, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} is said to have
performed the {%aśvamedha(!), rājasūya, puṇḍarīka%}, and {%gosava%}
sacrifices) and vicious persons happy, {%Draupadī%} concludes
that {%Dhātṛ%} and {%Vidhātṛ%} have clouded {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} senses,
that it is folly to aspire to final emancipation ({%mokṣa%}), that
the consequences of acts are inevitable, that God ({%Īśvara%},
{%Dhātṛ, Svayambhū Prapitāmaha%}) makes creatures to work
as a wooden doll is made to move its limbs by a wire-puller,
etc., and causes them to destroy each other, that God does
not behave towards his creatures like a father or mother,
but like a vicious person; either God is sinful, or Might (and
not God) is the true cause of acts, and then those are to be
pitied that have no might (III, {@30@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} censured
{%Kṛṣṇā%} for her atheism ({%nāstikya%}), saying that one should
not act virtuously from the desire of reaping fruits, but
[Page261-b+ 63]
because it is ordained so by the {%Veda%}, the ancient religion
revealed by the {%ṛṣis%}, and because it is the conduct of the
good and wise; neither should one doubt virtue or religion
nor censure God, by whose grace mortal man, by piety,
acquires immortality. For though we may not see the
results, being mysterious even to the gods, and the
illusion ({%māyā%}) of the gods is mysterious to us, yet virtue
and vice are not fruitless, as may be seen from the examples
of {%Vyāsa, Vasiṣṭha, Maitreya, Nārada, Lomaśa, Śuka%}, and
other {%ṛṣis%}, who by virtue have become superior even to the
gods; as also from her own and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} birth; nor
would men have practised virtue, generation after generation,
if asceticism, etc., were useless, and no one would pursue
salvation ({%nirvāṇa%}), but they would live like beasts, and
why should {%ṛṣis%}, gods, {%Gandharvas, Rākṣasas%}, and {%Asuras%},
who are above human conditions ({%īśvarāḥ%}), cherish virtue?
He who, trusting the proofs of his own reasoning, rejects
other authority or doubts religion and virtue, loses this and
yonder world, and is lower than even śūdras and robbers
(III, {@31@}). {%Kṛṣṇā%} said that she did not slander religion
nor disregard God ({%Īśvara, Prajāpati, Maheśvara%}); it was
affliction that had extorted these words from her. She
maintained that besides what a man obtains from Necessity
({%haṭha%}), Fate ({%daiva%}), Accident ({%svabhāva%}), and deeds in
a former life ({%karman%}) (all of which might be reduced to the
last item, also called {%adṛśya%}), which God distributes, there are
also things of which man himself is the cause, working through
his own intelligence and exertion. It is by exertion ({%utthāna%};
the explanation of Nīl. here seems to be inadmissible) that all
creatures live, even {%Dhātṛ%} and {%Vidhātṛ%}, as well as the crane
on the water. Those who believe only in Destiny ({%diṣṭa%})
or Necessity are both the meanest among men. On the other
hand, if God were not the giver of good and bad fruits,
there would not be any creature that was miserable, and
all exertions would be successful. {%Manu%} himself declares
that a man should act; and if he works, even if he be not
successful, his debt is cancelled. “Having exerted thyself,
thou wilt know what the fruit of thy exertions will be.
The tiller tills the soil with the plough, and sows the seed
thereon; he then sits silent, for the clouds are now the
cause; and if no rain favours him, the tiller is without
blame…If, however, no exertion is made, there can
be no success…All this, uttered by {%Bṛhaspati%} himself,
a learned brahman said to my father and my brothers; from
them I heard it” (III, {@32@}). {%Bhīma%} tried to prevail upon
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that (especially as they had lost the sovereignty
by his carelessness) he should make war with the {%Dhārta-%}
{%rāṣṭras%}, aided by the {%Sṛñjayas%} and {%Kaikeyas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%},
maintaining that a man should practise virtue ({%dharma%})
for the sake of gaining wealth ({%artha%}), and acquire wealth
for the sake of pleasure ({%kāma%}), but neither for its own sake;
that might and energy (and the protecting of the subjects)
constitute the virtue of the {%Kṣatriya%}, and that deviation
from the virtues of one's own order is never laudable;
that the {%Asuras%}, though elder brothers in possession of
power and abundance, were all vanquished by the gods
through stratagem; that as wealth should be spent by one
who wishes to increase his wealth, just as seeds are
scattered on the ground, thus a person who throws away
a little of his virtue like seeds ({%dharma%}) in order to gain
a larger measure of virtue is regarded as wise, and that
whatever sin a monarch commits in acquiring dominion,
he cancels it all afterwards by sacrifices and by bestowing
[Page262-a+ 63]
villages, etc., on brahmans (III, {@33@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} declared
that he was unable to violate the pledge, and that it was
now too late for {%Bhīma%} to use harsh words (III, {@34@}).
{%Bhīma%} said that only he whose life is unlimited, or who
knows what the period of his life is, has time to wait; they
ought to strive for the possession of the kingdom before they
died; “if a man, slaying his injurer, goes the very day into
hell, that hell becomes heaven to him; the pain one feels
in having to suppress his wrath is more burning than fire
itself;…thou art kind like a brahman, how hast thou
been born in the {%Kṣatriya%} order? those who are born in
this order are generally of cruel hearts; thou hast heard the
duties of kings, as promulgated by {%Manu%}, cruel and fraught
with crookedness and opposed to tranquillity ({%śama%});
moreover, we will not be able to live unknown, as we are
known all over the world, and many kings, who have been
expelled by us from their kingdoms, and robbed and exiled
by us, will assist {%Duryodhana%} and set against us numerous
spies in disguise; we have now lived in the woods for
thirteen months, which may be regarded as so many years,
as {%pūtikas%} (see BR. and Nīl.) are a substitute for the {%soma%};
or one may free himself from this sin by offering food to
a bull” (see Nīl.) (III, {@35@}).
