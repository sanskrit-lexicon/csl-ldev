[{@Aiṣīkaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the Aiṣīka
weapon”), the 84th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr., cf.
Aiṣīka. § 617: The driver of <is>Dhṛṣṭadyumna's</is> chariot,
who had managed to escape from <is>Kṛtavarman</is> at a
time when he was heedless, informs <is>Yudhiṣṭhira</is>, in the
morning, of the extermination of his army. <is>Yudhiṣṭhira</is>
falls down on the earth; <is>Sātyaki</is> holds him in his
embrace; <is>Bhīma</is>, etc. (<lang n="greek">α</lang>), stretch forth their arms. Having
recovered his senses <is>Yudhiṣṭhira</is> laments (<lang n="greek">β</lang>,) and
despatches <is>Nakula</is> to bring thither <is>Draupadī</is> and the
ladies with her; then he proceeds to view the slaughter in
his camp, and falls down on the earth with all his followers
(X, {@10@}). <is>Draupadī</is> arrives from <is>Upaplavya</is>, falls
down in the presence of Yudhiṣṭhira, is comforted by
Bhīma, addresses <is>Yudhiṣṭhira</is> (<lang n="greek">γ</lang>), and resolves to sit
in Prāya, if the <is>Pāṇḍavas</is> do not slay <is>Aśvatthāman</is>.
Yudhiṣṭhira urged her to forget her sorrows, as Aśvatthā-
man is not to be found. Draupadī insists on Aśvatthāman's
slaughter and the depredation of the gem on his head,
appealing in particular to Bhīmasena (<lang n="greek">δ</lang>). <is>Bhīmasena</is>,
making <is>Nakula</is> his charioteer, sets out in pursuit of
Aśvatthāman, guided by the track of the latter's car-wheels
(X, {@11@}). Kṛṣṇa urges Yudhiṣṭhira to make arrangements
for the safety of Bhīma, as Aśvatthāman has the <is>Brahma</is>-
<is>śiras</is> ({%b%}) weapon capable of exterminating all foes (X, {@12@}).
The Pāṇḍavas, with Kṛṣṇa, proceed on the track of Bhīma-
sena: Kṛṣṇa, <is>Arjuna</is>, and Yudhiṣṭhira on Kṛṣṇa's car
[Page026-b+ 63]
with steeds of the Kāmboja breed: <is>Śaibya</is> on the right,
Sugrīva on the left, <is>Meghapuṣpa</is> and <is>Balāhaka</is> being
pārṣṇivāhas, the standard having been made by <is>Viśva</is>-
<is>karman</is> and standing high like Māyā, with <is>Garuḍa</is>. They
in vain ask Bhīma to stop. They find Aśvatthāman sitting
with <is>Vyāsa</is> on the bank of {%Gaṅgā%} in the midst of many Ṛ.;
he is attired in a piece of cloth made of Kuśa-grass, etc…
He consecrates a blade of grass with Mantras, and converts it
into that powerful celestial weapon, and throws it off with the
words “for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas” (X, {@13@}).
Urged by Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna shoots the [Brāhma, PCR.]
weapon imparted to him by Droṇa, which was capable of
neutralizing all weapons. Extraordinary portents appear in
nature. <is>Nārada</is> and <is>Vyāsa</is>, trying to save the three
worlds, stand between the two fires (X, {@14@}). Arjuna
withdraws his weapon; but Aśvatthāman is incapable of
withdrawing his, as no person of uncleansed soul can bring
it back, after it has once been let off, but only a brahmacārin
(and such a one is Arjuna); otherwise it strikes off his own
head. Vyāsa praises Arjuna for not having before used
the Brahmaśiras weapon; “that region where Brahmaśiras
is baffled by another high weapon, suffers a drought for
twelve years”; he proposes to him to give the Pāṇḍavas the
gem on his head; then the Pāṇḍavas would in return grant
him his life. Aśvatthāman surrenders his gem, whose wearer
ceases to have any fear from weapons, etc., and from D., Dā.,
and N., and Rā.; the weapon he throws into the wombs of
the Pāṇḍava women (X, {@15@}). Kṛṣṇa says that a brahman
at Upaplavya has said to Uttarā, “while the Kuru line will
become extinct, a son will be born to thee, and he will for
that reason be called <is>Parikṣit</is>.” Aśvatthāman says that
his words could not but be fulfilled. Kṛṣṇa says that
the fœtus will die, but be recalled to a long life; but
Aśvatthāman shall wander for 3000 years alone, and without
being able to talk to anyone; the stench of pus and blood
shall emanate from him, and inaccessible forests and dreary
moors shall be his abode; he shall wander over the earth with
the weight of all diseases on him. Parikṣit shall learn the
use of all weapons from <is>Kṛpa</is> and rule the earth for sixty
years; Kṛṣṇa will revive him. Vyāsa approves of Kṛṣṇa's
curse. Aśvatthāman proceeds to the forest. The Pāṇḍavas
with Kṛṣṇa, Vyāsa, and Nārada, taking with them the gem,
come to Draupadī, who is sitting in Prāya. Bhīma comforts
Draupadī (<lang n="greek">η</lang>). Draupadī asks Yudhiṣṭhira to place upon his
head the gem taken from Aśvatthāman. Yudhiṣṭhira asks
Kṛṣṇa (X, {@16@}) about the true cause of Aśvatthāman's success
in destroying the Pāṇḍava army (<lang n="greek">θ</lang>). Kṛṣṇa ascribes it to
the aid of Mahādeva, and relates that when <is>Brahmán</is>,
desirous of creating, saw <is>Rudra</is>, he asked him to create
living creatures; Rudra promised to do so, and plunged into
the waters and practised austerities. Then Brahmán called
into existence another being in order to make him the creator
of living creatures, and he created <is>Dakṣa</is>, etc.; but they
ran towards their creator from hunger, desirous of devouring
him, and he repaired to Brahmán, who assigned herbs, etc.,
as their food, and the weak beings to the strong ones. The
creatures multiplied. Then Rudra rose from the water,
became angry, and caused his productive limb to disappear
in the earth. He had created food (herbs and plants) for
all these creatures. Then he went away, in cheerlessness
and rage, to the <is>Muñjavat</is> mountains in order to practise
severer austerities (X, {@17@}). After the <is>Kṛta</is>-age the gods
prepared a sacrifice, but not knowing Rudra truly they
[Page027-a+ 63]
assigned no share to him. Rudra constructed a bow of two
of the four kinds of sacrifices (v. the note of PCR., p. 58),
and came as a brahmacārin to the sacrifice; the earth
shrank with fear, etc.; Rudra pierced the sacrifice in the
heart; it assumed the shape of a deer and fled away with
<is>Agni</is>, pursued by Rudra through the skies; the gods were
stupefied; Rudra with his bow broke the arms of <is>Savitṛ</is> and
plucked out the eyes of <is>Bhaga</is> and the teeth of <is>Pūṣan</is>;
the gods uttered a cry; the string of his bow burst; the gods
and the sacrifice gratified Rudra; he threw his wrath into
the water; that wrath, assuming the form of fire, is always
employed in consuming the water. He then gave unto
Savitṛ his arms, to Bhaga his eyes, and to Pūṣan his teeth,
and restored the sacrifice. The gods assigned to him all
the libations of clarified butter as his share (X, {@18@}).
