[{@Skandopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“episode of Skanḍa”).—§ 500
(cf. Skanda-Śakra-samāg.). The {%Pāriṣadas%} of {%Skanda%}:
When {%Skanda%} was struck with the thunderbolt, a number
of male children were produced, who steal little children,
whether born or in the womb, as also a number of female
children. They adopted {%Viśākha%} as their father. {%Bhadra-%}
{%śākha%} (form of {%Skanda%}, cf. v. 14400), with a face like that
of a goat, in the battle protected his sons and daughters, in
the presence of the mothers. Therefore they call {%Skanda%}
{%Kumārapitṛ%} (so B., C. has {%Kumāraṃ pitaraṃ%}), and those who
desire to have sons worship {%Rudra%} as {%Agni%}, and {%Umā%} as
{%Svāhā%} (so C., B. has {%Agnimukhāṃ%} instead of {%Agnim Umāṃ%}).
The daughters of the {%Tapa%} fire obtained from {%Skanda%} that
they became the mothers of the whole world; some of them
should be good ({%śivāḥ%}) and some evil ({%aśivāḥ%}). Having
adopted {%Skanda%} as their son, the host of the mothers departed.
{%Kākī, Halimā%}, etc. (in all seven) (<lang n="greek">α</lang>) had, by the grace of
{%Skanda%}, a terrible son {%Śiśu%}, who is named {%vīrāṣṭaka%} (i.e.
consisting of eight men) or, when the goat's head is included,
{%navaka%} (i.e. consisting of nine). The sixth face of {%Skanda%} is
that of a goat, the best of the six, honoured by the mothers,
that by which {%Bhadraśākha%} created the divine energy ({%?śaktiṃ%}
{%yenāsṛjad divyāṃ%}). This happened on the fifth day of the
bright half of the mouth, and on the sixth a terrific battle
took place (III, {@228@}).—§ 501. Description of {%Skanda. Śrī%},
embodied and looking like a lotus, rendered her allegiance to
him. The {%brahmans%} and {%maharṣis%} praised him, saying:
“{%Hiraṇyagarbha!%} thou who wast born only six nights ago,
[Page644-a+ 63]
do thou become {%Indra%},” and at his request they explained to
him the offices of {%Indra (b%}). Even {%Indra%} besought him to
become the lord of the gods. But, at the request of {%Skanda%},
{%Indra%} retained his sovereignty, and, with all the gods,
anointed {%Skanda%} as the leader of the celestial forces, and
fastened the celestial wreath of gold, of {%Viśvakarman's%} manu—
facture, round his neck. {%Rudra%} came with {%Pārvatī%} and
honoured him. {%Skanda%} is called the son of {%Rudra%} because
{%Agni%} is called {%Rudra%} by {%brahmans%}, and because he was pro-
duced by {%Rudra%} entering Fire, and because he was honoured
by {%Rudra%} before all the gods, and because the {%Śveta%} mountain,
where he was reared by the {%Kṛttikās%}, was formed of {%Rudra's%}
semen virile. The red cock, given him by {%Agni%}, formed the
ensign of {%Skanda%}, perched on the top of his chariot. The
power ({%śakti%}) which conduces to the victory of the gods,
advanced before him. An innate armour entered into his
body, and always manifests itself on the battle-field. Under
the recitation of holy texts he was honoured by D., G., Aps.,
Pś., etc. Then he married {%Devasenā%} (names v. 14451),
Bṛh. performing the necessary prayers and oblations. Then
{%Lakṣmī%} began to serve him. Therefore the fifth lunar day
is called {%Śrī-pañcamī%}, and the sixth “a great tithi” ({%mahā-%}
{%tithiḥ%}) (III, {@229@})
