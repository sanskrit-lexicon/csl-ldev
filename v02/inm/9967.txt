[{@Skandopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“episode of Skanḍa”).—§ 500
<div n="lb">(cf. Skanda-Śakra-samāg.). The {%Pāriṣadas%} of {%Skanda:%}
<div n="lb">When {%Skanda%} was struck with the thunderbolt, a number
<div n="lb">of male children were produced, who steal little children,
<div n="lb">whether born or in the womb, as also a number of female
<div n="lb">children. They adopted {%Viśākha%} as their father. {%Bhadra-%}
<div n="lb">{%śākha%} (form of {%Skanda,%} cf. v. 14400), with a face like that
<div n="lb">of a goat, in the battle protected his sons and daughters, in
<div n="lb">the presence of the mothers. Therefore they call {%Skanda%}
<div n="lb">{%Kumārapitṛ%} (so B., C. has {%Kumāraṃ pitaraṃ%}), and those who
<div n="lb">desire to have sons worship {%Rudra%} as {%Agni,%} and {%Umā%} as
<div n="lb">{%Svāhā%} (so C., B. has {%Agnimukhāṃ%} instead of {%Agnim Umāṃ%}).
<div n="lb">The daughters of the {%Tapa%} fire obtained from {%Skanda%} that
<div n="lb">they became the mothers of the whole world; some of them
<div n="lb">should be good {%(śivāḥ)%} and some evil {%(aśivāḥ).%} Having
<div n="lb">adopted {%Skanda%} as their son, the host of the mothers departed.
<div n="lb">{%Kākī, Halimā,%} etc. (in all seven) (<lang n="greek"></lang>) had, by the grace of
<div n="lb">{%Skanda,%} a terrible son {%Śiśu,%} who is named {%vīrāṣṭaka%} (i.e.
<div n="lb">consisting of eight men) or, when the goat's head is included,
<div n="lb">{%navaka%} (i.e. consisting of nine). The sixth face of {%Skanda%} is
<div n="lb">that of a goat, the best of the six, honoured by the mothers,
<div n="lb">that by which {%Bhadraśākha%} created the divine energy {%(?śaktiṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%yenāsṛjad divyāṃ).%} This happened on the fifth day of the
<div n="lb">bright half of the mouth, and on the sixth a terrific battle
<div n="lb">took place (III, {@228@}).—§ 501. Description of {%Skanda. Śrī,%}
<div n="lb">embodied and looking like a lotus, rendered her allegiance to
<div n="lb">him. The {%brahmans%} and {%maharṣis%} praised him, saying:
<div n="lb">“{%Hiraṇyagarbha!%} thou who wast born only six nights ago,
[Page644-a+ 63]
<div n="lb">do thou become {%Indra,%}” and at his request they explained to
<div n="lb">him the offices of {%Indra (b).%} Even {%Indra%} besought him to
<div n="lb">become the lord of the gods. But, at the request of {%Skanda,%}
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} retained his sovereignty, and, with all the gods,
<div n="lb">anointed {%Skanda%} as the leader of the celestial forces, and
<div n="lb">fastened the celestial wreath of gold, of {%Viśvakarman's%} manu—
<div n="lb">facture, round his neck. {%Rudra%} came with {%Pārvatī%} and
<div n="lb">honoured him. {%Skanda%} is called the son of {%Rudra%} because
<div n="lb">{%Agni%} is called {%Rudra%} by {%brahmans,%} and because he was pro-
<div n="lb">duced by {%Rudra%} entering Fire, and because he was honoured
<div n="lb">by {%Rudra%} before all the gods, and because the {%Śveta%} mountain,
<div n="lb">where he was reared by the {%Kṛttikās,%} was formed of {%Rudra's%}
<div n="lb">semen virile. The red cock, given him by {%Agni,%} formed the
<div n="lb">ensign of {%Skanda,%} perched on the top of his chariot. The
<div n="lb">power {%(śakti)%} which conduces to the victory of the gods,
<div n="lb">advanced before him. An innate armour entered into his
<div n="lb">body, and always manifests itself on the battle-field. Under
<div n="lb">the recitation of holy texts he was honoured by D., G., Aps.,
<div n="lb">Pś., etc. Then he married {%Devasenā%} (names v. 14451),
<div n="lb">Bṛh. performing the necessary prayers and oblations. Then
<div n="lb">{%Lakṣmī%} began to serve him. Therefore the fifth lunar day
<div n="lb">is called {%Śrī-pañcamī,%} and the sixth “a great tithi” {%(mahā-%}
<div n="lb">{%tithiḥ)%} (III, {@229@})
