[{@Vipulopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode about Vipula”):
§ 743{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: There was, in days
of yore, a Ṛ. {%Devaśaraman%}; his beautiful wife {%Ruci%} fascinated
every one who saw her, both D., G., and Dā., and particularly
{%Indra. Devaśarman%} knew very well the disposition of women,
as well as {%Indra's%} coveting other men's wives. Once, desirous
of performing a sacrifice, he summoned his favourite disciple
{%Vipula Bhārgava%}, and asked him, during his absence, to
protect {%Ruci%} against {%Indra%}, describing to him the disguises
that {%Indra%} assumes (<lang n="greek">α</lang>). {%Vipula%}, by his {%Yoga%}-power, entered
the body of {%Ruci%} (description) (XIII, {@40@}). {%Indra%} came, but
{%Ruci%} was unable to move or to utter a word in reply; then,
influenced by {%Vipula%}, she answered in {%Sanskrit (? vāṇī%}
{%saṃskārabhūṣaṇā%}) words that she did not intend to utter.
{%Indra%} became perplexed, and when he with his spiritual eye
discovered {%Vipula%} within {%Ruci%}, he became afraid that he might
curse him. {%Vipula%} left the body of {%Ruci%} and returned to his
own body which was lying near, and rebuked {%Indra%}, mention-
ing {%Gautama's%} curse, owing to which {%Indra's%} body became
disfigured with 1,000 sex-marks, which, owing to {%Gautama's%}
[Page739-b+ 63]
compassion, were afterwards changed into eyes, “see that
thou dost not, with thy sons and counselors, meet with
destruction.” {%Śakra%}, overwhelmed with shame, made himself
invisible. A moment after, {%Devaśarman%} came back, and
granted {%Vipula%} the boon that he should never swerve away
from righteousness; dismissed by his preceptor, {%Vipula%} left
his abode and practised the most severe austerities. {%Deva-%}
{%śarman%} also, with his spouse, began to live in the woods,
perfectly fearless of {%Indra%} (XIII, {@41@}). {%Vipula%} became full
of pride. After some time the occasion came for a ceremony
of gifts, with respect to the sister of {%Ruci%} ~ the {%Aṅga%}-king
{%Citraratha%}. Meanwhile, a celestial damsel dropped some
flowers down to the earth; they were picked up by {%Ruci%},
who, adorned with them, went to the palace of the {%Aṅga%}-
king. Her sister, {%Prabhāvatī%}, the {%Aṅga%}-queen, urged her to
obtain some for her, and {%Ruci%} informed her husband, who,
summoning {%Vipula%}, commanded him to bring him some
flowers of the same kind. {%Vipula%} found some such flowers
still lying scattered, quite fresh, and set out for {%Campā%}; on
his way he saw a human couple moving in a circle, hand in
hand; a dispute arose between them, and at last, each of
them took the oath “that one of us who speaks falsely shall,
in the next world, meet with the end which will be {%Vipula's%}”.
{%Vipula%} became very sad; proceeding a little way he beheld
six other men playing with dice made of gold and silver;
they were heard by {%Vipula%} to take the same oath as the first
couple. At last he recollected the manner in which he had
acted in protecting his preceptor's wife (placing limb within
limb, face within face), without telling his preceptor the
truth. Coming to {%Campā%}, he gave the flowers to his
preceptor (XIII, {@42@}). {%Devaśarman%}, too, knew what he had
seen on his way, and how he had acted in protecting {%Ruci%};
he explained that the first couple were Day and Night, the
others the six Seasons. He absolved {%Vipula%} and ascended to
heaven with his wife and his disciple. {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} had
narrated this tale to {%Bhīṣma%} on the banks of the {%Gaṅgā%}
(XIII, {@43@}).
