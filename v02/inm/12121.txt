[{@Vipulopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode about Vipula”):
<div n="lb">§ 743{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: There was, in days
<div n="lb">of yore, a Ṛ. {%Devaśaraman;%} his beautiful wife {%Ruci%} fascinated
<div n="lb">every one who saw her, both D., G., and Dā., and particularly
<div n="lb">{%Indra. Devaśarman%} knew very well the disposition of women,
<div n="lb">as well as {%Indra's%} coveting other men's wives. Once, desirous
<div n="lb">of performing a sacrifice, he summoned his favourite disciple
<div n="lb">{%Vipula Bhārgava,%} and asked him, during his absence, to
<div n="lb">protect {%Ruci%} against {%Indra,%} describing to him the disguises
<div n="lb">that {%Indra%} assumes (<lang n="greek"></lang>). {%Vipula,%} by his {%Yoga%}-power, entered
<div n="lb">the body of {%Ruci%} (description) (XIII, {@40@}). {%Indra%} came, but
<div n="lb">{%Ruci%} was unable to move or to utter a word in reply; then,
<div n="lb">influenced by {%Vipula,%} she answered in {%Sanskrit (? vāṇī%}
<div n="lb">{%saṃskārabhūṣaṇā)%} words that she did not intend to utter.
<div n="lb">{%Indra%} became perplexed, and when he with his spiritual eye
<div n="lb">discovered {%Vipula%} within {%Ruci,%} he became afraid that he might
<div n="lb">curse him. {%Vipula%} left the body of {%Ruci%} and returned to his
<div n="lb">own body which was lying near, and rebuked {%Indra,%} mention-
<div n="lb">ing {%Gautama's%} curse, owing to which {%Indra's%} body became
<div n="lb">disfigured with 1,000 sex-marks, which, owing to {%Gautama's%}
[Page739-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">compassion, were afterwards changed into eyes, “see that
<div n="lb">thou dost not, with thy sons and counselors, meet with
<div n="lb">destruction.” {%Śakra,%} overwhelmed with shame, made himself
<div n="lb">invisible. A moment after, {%Devaśarman%} came back, and
<div n="lb">granted {%Vipula%} the boon that he should never swerve away
<div n="lb">from righteousness; dismissed by his preceptor, {%Vipula%} left
<div n="lb">his abode and practised the most severe austerities. {%Deva-%}
<div n="lb">{%śarman%} also, with his spouse, began to live in the woods,
<div n="lb">perfectly fearless of {%Indra%} (XIII, {@41@}). {%Vipula%} became full
<div n="lb">of pride. After some time the occasion came for a ceremony
<div n="lb">of gifts, with respect to the sister of {%Ruci%} ~ the {%Aṅga%}-king
<div n="lb">{%Citraratha.%} Meanwhile, a celestial damsel dropped some
<div n="lb">flowers down to the earth; they were picked up by {%Ruci,%}
<div n="lb">who, adorned with them, went to the palace of the {%Aṅga%}-
<div n="lb">king. Her sister, {%Prabhāvatī,%} the {%Aṅga%}-queen, urged her to
<div n="lb">obtain some for her, and {%Ruci%} informed her husband, who,
<div n="lb">summoning {%Vipula,%} commanded him to bring him some
<div n="lb">flowers of the same kind. {%Vipula%} found some such flowers
<div n="lb">still lying scattered, quite fresh, and set out for {%Campā;%} on
<div n="lb">his way he saw a human couple moving in a circle, hand in
<div n="lb">hand; a dispute arose between them, and at last, each of
<div n="lb">them took the oath “that one of us who speaks falsely shall,
<div n="lb">in the next world, meet with the end which will be {%Vipula's%}”.
<div n="lb">{%Vipula%} became very sad; proceeding a little way he beheld
<div n="lb">six other men playing with dice made of gold and silver;
<div n="lb">they were heard by {%Vipula%} to take the same oath as the first
<div n="lb">couple. At last he recollected the manner in which he had
<div n="lb">acted in protecting his preceptor's wife (placing limb within
<div n="lb">limb, face within face), without telling his preceptor the
<div n="lb">truth. Coming to {%Campā,%} he gave the flowers to his
<div n="lb">preceptor (XIII, {@42@}). {%Devaśarman,%} too, knew what he had
<div n="lb">seen on his way, and how he had acted in protecting {%Ruci;%}
<div n="lb">he explained that the first couple were Day and Night, the
<div n="lb">others the six Seasons. He absolved {%Vipula%} and ascended to
<div n="lb">heaven with his wife and his disciple. {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} had
<div n="lb">narrated this tale to {%Bhīṣma%} on the banks of the {%Gaṅgā%}
<div n="lb">(XIII, {@43@}).
