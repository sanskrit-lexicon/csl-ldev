[{@Vasiṣṭhopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Vasiṣṭha”). § 223 (cf. Caitrarathap.). {%Arjuna%} asked:
“Why did {%Kalmāṣapāda%} command his queen to go to
{%Vasiṣṭha?%} And was this an act of sin on the part of
{%Vasiṣṭha?%}” The {%Gandharva%} said: Under the influence of
the curse, {%Kalmāṣapāda%}, in anger, went out of his capital,
accompanied by his wife. In a solitary part of the woods he
saw a {%brahman%} and his wife ({%Āṅgirasī%}, v. 6908) embracing
each other. The couple ran away, but {%Kalmāṣapāda%}
forcibly seized the {%brahman%}. The {%brāhmaṇī%} asked him to
liberate her husband, but he cruelly devoured him. The
tears that the woman shed blazed up like fire and consumed
everything in that place. The {%brāhmaṇī%} cursed the {%rājarṣi%},
saying that he should meet with instant death when cohabit-
ing with his wife, and that his wife should have a son
from {%Vasiṣṭha%}, whose children he had devoured, and that
child should be the propagator of his race. Then she entered
the fire. {%Vasiṣṭha%}, by his ascetic power, immediately knew
all about it. And long after this, when the {%rājarṣi%} became
freed from his curse, he approached his wife {%Madayantī%}, not
remembering the curse of the {%brāhmaṇī%}. Hearing, however,
the words of his wife, he recollected the curse, and, therefore,
he appointed {%Vasiṣṭha%} to beget a son on his queen (I, {@182@}).
