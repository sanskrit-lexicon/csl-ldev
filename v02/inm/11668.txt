[{@Vasiṣṭhopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
<div n="lb">Vasiṣṭha”). § 223 (cf. Caitrarathap.). {%Arjuna%} asked:
<div n="lb">“Why did {%Kalmāṣapāda%} command his queen to go to
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha?%} And was this an act of sin on the part of
<div n="lb">{%Vasiṣṭha?%}” The {%Gandharva%} said: Under the influence of
<div n="lb">the curse, {%Kalmāṣapāda,%} in anger, went out of his capital,
<div n="lb">accompanied by his wife. In a solitary part of the woods he
<div n="lb">saw a {%brahman%} and his wife ({%Āṅgirasī,%} v. 6908) embracing
<div n="lb">each other. The couple ran away, but {%Kalmāṣapāda%}
<div n="lb">forcibly seized the {%brahman.%} The {%brāhmaṇī%} asked him to
<div n="lb">liberate her husband, but he cruelly devoured him. The
<div n="lb">tears that the woman shed blazed up like fire and consumed
<div n="lb">everything in that place. The {%brāhmaṇī%} cursed the {%rājarṣi,%}
<div n="lb">saying that he should meet with instant death when cohabit-
<div n="lb">ing with his wife, and that his wife should have a son
<div n="lb">from {%Vasiṣṭha,%} whose children he had devoured, and that
<div n="lb">child should be the propagator of his race. Then she entered
<div n="lb">the fire. {%Vasiṣṭha,%} by his ascetic power, immediately knew
<div n="lb">all about it. And long after this, when the {%rājarṣi%} became
<div n="lb">freed from his curse, he approached his wife {%Madayantī,%} not
<div n="lb">remembering the curse of the {%brāhmaṇī.%} Hearing, however,
<div n="lb">the words of his wife, he recollected the curse, and, therefore,
<div n="lb">he appointed {%Vasiṣṭha%} to beget a son on his queen (I, {@182@}).
