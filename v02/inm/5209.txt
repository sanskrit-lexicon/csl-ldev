Sun, the Moon, and {%Bṛhaspati%} (i.e. the planet Jupiter)
simultaneously enter the constellation of Puṣya, the Kṛta
age will begin again (v. 13099), and commissioned by Time
a brahman named Kalkin Viṣṇuyaśas (cf. the note of
PCR.), born in Sambhalagrāma, in the house of a brahman,
will, surrounded by brahmans, exterminate all the Mleccha
crowds (III, {@190@}). Having exterminated the thieves and
the robbers, {%K%}. will, at a great horse sacrifice, duly give away
this earth to the brahmans and then enter a delightful forest,
and the {%Kṛtayuga%} will be re-established. This is said in the
Purāṇa (praised by the ṛṣis) which is narrated by Vāyu:
III, {@190@}, 13101 ({%°ī Viṣṇuyaśā nāma%}); {@191@}, 13111 ({%°ī%} B.,
C. has {%°iḥ%}).—§ 717{%b%} (Nārāyaṇīya): XII, {@340@}, 12968 (the
