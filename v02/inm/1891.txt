{@Caitrarathaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to Citraratha,”
the eleventh of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Caitra-
ratha[ṃ] parvan.) § 216: Within a few days there came
a {%brahman%} to the abode of their host, whom they asked to
narrate the birth of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} from the sacrificial fire, and
that of {%Kṛṣṇā%} from the centre of the {%vedī%}, and that of {%Śikhaṇḍin%},
and how {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} learnt the use of all weapons from
{%Droṇa%}, and how the friendship of {%Droṇa%} and {%Drupada%} was
broken (I, {@165@}).—§ 217: The {%brahman%} related (not
mentioning {%Aśvatthāman%}) the birth of {%Droṇa%} (§ 200), his
friendship with {%Drupada%}, and his visit to {%Rāma%} (§ 201;
he obtained the {%Brahmāstra%}, v. 6340), the breaking of his
friendship with {%Drupada%} (§ 202), how {%Bhīṣma%} prevailed
upon him to teach the princes, etc. (both {%Arjuna%} and the
others promised to give what he might ask for his fee, v. 6346),
and the chastisement of {%Drupada%} (§ 209; {%Drupada%} resides
in {%Chattravatī%}, v. 6348) (I, {@166@}).—§ 218: Draupadī-
sambhava (q.v.).—§ 219: Hearing the words of the {%brahman%},
the sons of {%Kuntī%} seemed to be, as it were, pierced with
darts. {%Kuntī%} proposed to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that they should go
to the {%Pāñcālas%}, a country they had not seen before, and he
consented for his part. When the other brothers had likewise
consented, they set out for the town of {%Drupada%} (I, {@168@}).—
§ 220: When they were living disguised, {%Vyāsa%} came and
told them that formerly the daughter of a {%ṛṣi%}, notwith-
standing her beauty, obtained no husband, and therefore
by austerities propitiated {%Śaṅkara%} five times, saying “Give
me a husband.” Accordingly the god said (notwithstanding
her objection) that she should in a future life have five
[Page170-b+ 63]
husbands. “That damsel is {%Kṛṣṇā%}, appointed to be the
wife of ye all; go therefore to the capital of the {%Pāñcālas%} and
dwell ye there.” He then left them (I, {@169@}).—§ 221: After
{%Vyāsa%} had gone away, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} proceeded [towards the
{%Pāñcālas%}] in a northerly direction, walking day and night
till they reached the {%tīrtha Somāśrayāyaṇa%} (“the shrine of
{%Rudra%} with the crescent mark on his brow,” PCR. with
Nīl.). Then they arrived at the {%Gaṅgā; Dhanañjaya%} (i.e.
{%Arjuna%}) walked before them, torch in hand. The {%Gandharva%}
king with his wives was then sporting there in the {%Geṅgā%}.
Bending his bow to a circle, he said, “Excepting the first
80 {%lavas%}, the {%muhūrta%} ({%prasthānakālaṃ%}, Nīl.) that begins
with the twilight preceding nightfall has been appointed
for the {%Yakṣas, Gandharvas%}, and {%Rākṣasas%}, capable of going
everywhere at will; the rest has been appointed for man
to do his work. If therefore men, wandering during those
moments from greed of gain, come near us, both we and
the {%rākṣasas%} slay those fools. Therefore persons acquainted
with the {%Vedas%} never applaud those men, who then approach
any piece of water. Stay ye at a distance. Know that I am
{%Aṅgāraparṇa%} (= {%Citraratha%}, v. 6475; cf. LIA. i, 666/814),
the friend of {%Kubera%}, and this my forest is also called
{%Aṅgāraparṇa%}, where neither {%kauṇapas%} (i.e. {%rākṣasas%}), nor
{%śṛṅgins%} (a horned animal, see BR.; according to Nīl. it is =
{%kāpālikāḥ%}, a Śivaitic sect), nor gods, nor men can come.”
{%Arjuna%} replied: “Whether it be day, night, or twilight,
who can bar others from the ocean, the {%Himālaya%}, and
{%Gangā?%}” ({%b). Arjuna%} burnt the {%Gandharva's%} chariot with
the {%Āgneya%} weapon, given by {%Bṛhaspati%} (the preceptor of
{%Indra%}) to {%Bharadvāja%}, by him to {%Agniveśya%}, by him to {%Droṇa%},
by {%Droṇa%} to {%Arjuna%}, and dragged him, who had become
unconscious, by the hair. His wife {%Kumbhīnasī%} prevailed
upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and he commanded {%Arjuna%} to spare him.
He declared that, instead of his former name, {%Citraratha%}
(“who has a variegated chariot”), he should now be called
{%Dagdharatha%} (“whose chariot has been burnt”), and imparted
to {%Arjuna%} the {%Gāndharvī vidyā%} called {%Cākṣuṣī (c%}). He
also gave {%Arjuna%} and each of his brothers one hundred horses
born in the country of the Gandharvas ({%Gandharvajānāṃ%}),
endued with the speed of wind and employed in carrying the
gods and Gandharvas, a portion of {%Indra's vajra%} (“thunder-
bolt”) ({%d). Arjuna%} in return gave him the {%Āgneya%} weapon,
and asked him why they, though skilled in the {%Vedas%}, had
been censured by him. He replied that it was because they
were without fires, without sacriflces, and without a {%brahman%}
walking before them. “The {%Yakskas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas%},
{%Piśācas, Uragas%}, and {%Dānavas%} know the history of the {%Kuru%}
race; I have heard from {%Nārada%} and other {%devarṣis%} the
deeds of your ancestors. I have been vanquished by thee in
battle on account of the {%brahmacarya%} being rigidly observed:
a {%kṣattriya%}, who is addicted to lust, if he fights in the
night, can never escape with life; but even if addicted to
lust, he who has a {%purohita%} may vanquish all wanderers
of the night. Therefore, O {%Tāpatya!%} kings should always
select a fit {%purohita%}” (I, {@170@}).—§ 222: {%Citraratha%} related
