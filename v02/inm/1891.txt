{@Caitrarathaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to Citraratha,”
<div n="lb">the eleventh of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Caitra-
<div n="lb">ratha[ṃ] parvan.) § 216: Within a few days there came
<div n="lb">a {%brahman%} to the abode of their host, whom they asked to
<div n="lb">narrate the birth of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} from the sacrificial fire, and
<div n="lb">that of {%Kṛṣṇā%} from the centre of the {%vedī,%} and that of {%Śikhaṇḍin,%}
<div n="lb">and how {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} learnt the use of all weapons from
<div n="lb">{%Droṇa,%} and how the friendship of {%Droṇa%} and {%Drupada%} was
<div n="lb">broken (I, {@165@}).—§ 217: The {%brahman%} related (not
<div n="lb">mentioning {%Aśvatthāman%}) the birth of {%Droṇa%} (§ 200), his
<div n="lb">friendship with {%Drupada,%} and his visit to {%Rāma%} (§ 201;
<div n="lb">he obtained the {%Brahmāstra,%} v. 6340), the breaking of his
<div n="lb">friendship with {%Drupada%} (§ 202), how {%Bhīṣma%} prevailed
<div n="lb">upon him to teach the princes, etc. (both {%Arjuna%} and the
<div n="lb">others promised to give what he might ask for his fee, v. 6346),
<div n="lb">and the chastisement of {%Drupada%} (§ 209; {%Drupada%} resides
<div n="lb">in {%Chattravatī,%} v. 6348) (I, {@166@}).—§ 218: Draupadī-
<div n="lb">sambhava (q.v.).—§ 219: Hearing the words of the {%brahman,%}
<div n="lb">the sons of {%Kuntī%} seemed to be, as it were, pierced with
<div n="lb">darts. {%Kuntī%} proposed to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that they should go
<div n="lb">to the {%Pāñcālas,%} a country they had not seen before, and he
<div n="lb">consented for his part. When the other brothers had likewise
<div n="lb">consented, they set out for the town of {%Drupada%} (I, {@168@}).—
<div n="lb">§ 220: When they were living disguised, {%Vyāsa%} came and
<div n="lb">told them that formerly the daughter of a {%ṛṣi,%} notwith-
<div n="lb">standing her beauty, obtained no husband, and therefore
<div n="lb">by austerities propitiated {%Śaṅkara%} five times, saying “Give
<div n="lb">me a husband.” Accordingly the god said (notwithstanding
<div n="lb">her objection) that she should in a future life have five
[Page170-b+ 63]
<div n="lb">husbands. “That damsel is {%Kṛṣṇā,%} appointed to be the
<div n="lb">wife of ye all; go therefore to the capital of the {%Pāñcālas%} and
<div n="lb">dwell ye there.” He then left them (I, {@169@}).—§ 221: After
<div n="lb">{%Vyāsa%} had gone away, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} proceeded [towards the
<div n="lb">{%Pāñcālas%}] in a northerly direction, walking day and night
<div n="lb">till they reached the {%tīrtha Somāśrayāyaṇa%} (“the shrine of
<div n="lb">{%Rudra%} with the crescent mark on his brow,” PCR. with
<div n="lb">Nīl.). Then they arrived at the {%Gaṅgā; Dhanañjaya%} (i.e.
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%}) walked before them, torch in hand. The {%Gandharva%}
<div n="lb">king with his wives was then sporting there in the {%Geṅgā.%}
<div n="lb">Bending his bow to a circle, he said, “Excepting the first
<div n="lb">80 {%lavas,%} the {%muhūrta%} ({%prasthānakālaṃ,%} Nīl.) that begins
<div n="lb">with the twilight preceding nightfall has been appointed
<div n="lb">for the {%Yakṣas, Gandharvas,%} and {%Rākṣasas,%} capable of going
<div n="lb">everywhere at will; the rest has been appointed for man
<div n="lb">to do his work. If therefore men, wandering during those
<div n="lb">moments from greed of gain, come near us, both we and
<div n="lb">the {%rākṣasas%} slay those fools. Therefore persons acquainted
<div n="lb">with the {%Vedas%} never applaud those men, who then approach
<div n="lb">any piece of water. Stay ye at a distance. Know that I am
<div n="lb">{%Aṅgāraparṇa%} (= {%Citraratha,%} v. 6475; cf. LIA. i, 666/814),
<div n="lb">the friend of {%Kubera,%} and this my forest is also called
<div n="lb">{%Aṅgāraparṇa,%} where neither {%kauṇapas%} (i.e. {%rākṣasas%}), nor
<div n="lb">{%śṛṅgins%} (a horned animal, see BR.; according to Nīl. it is =
<div n="lb">{%kāpālikāḥ,%} a Śivaitic sect), nor gods, nor men can come.”
<div n="lb">{%Arjuna%} replied: “Whether it be day, night, or twilight,
<div n="lb">who can bar others from the ocean, the {%Himālaya,%} and
<div n="lb">{%Gangā?%}” {%(b). Arjuna%} burnt the {%Gandharva's%} chariot with
<div n="lb">the {%Āgneya%} weapon, given by {%Bṛhaspati%} (the preceptor of
<div n="lb">{%Indra%}) to {%Bharadvāja,%} by him to {%Agniveśya,%} by him to {%Droṇa,%}
<div n="lb">by {%Droṇa%} to {%Arjuna,%} and dragged him, who had become
<div n="lb">unconscious, by the hair. His wife {%Kumbhīnasī%} prevailed
<div n="lb">upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} and he commanded {%Arjuna%} to spare him.
<div n="lb">He declared that, instead of his former name, {%Citraratha%}
<div n="lb">(“who has a variegated chariot”), he should now be called
<div n="lb">{%Dagdharatha%} (“whose chariot has been burnt”), and imparted
<div n="lb">to {%Arjuna%} the {%Gāndharvī vidyā%} called {%Cākṣuṣī (c).%} He
<div n="lb">also gave {%Arjuna%} and each of his brothers one hundred horses
<div n="lb">born in the country of the Gandharvas {%(Gandharvajānāṃ),%}
<div n="lb">endued with the speed of wind and employed in carrying the
<div n="lb">gods and Gandharvas, a portion of {%Indra's vajra%} (“thunder-
<div n="lb">bolt”) {%(d). Arjuna%} in return gave him the {%Āgneya%} weapon,
<div n="lb">and asked him why they, though skilled in the {%Vedas,%} had
<div n="lb">been censured by him. He replied that it was because they
<div n="lb">were without fires, without sacriflces, and without a {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">walking before them. “The {%Yakskas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas,%}
<div n="lb">{%Piśācas, Uragas,%} and {%Dānavas%} know the history of the {%Kuru%}
<div n="lb">race; I have heard from {%Nārada%} and other {%devarṣis%} the
<div n="lb">deeds of your ancestors. I have been vanquished by thee in
<div n="lb">battle on account of the {%brahmacarya%} being rigidly observed:
<div n="lb">a {%kṣattriya,%} who is addicted to lust, if he fights in the
<div n="lb">night, can never escape with life; but even if addicted to
<div n="lb">lust, he who has a {%purohita%} may vanquish all wanderers
<div n="lb">of the night. Therefore, O {%Tāpatya!%} kings should always
<div n="lb">select a fit {%purohita%}” (I, {@170@}).—§ 222: {%Citraratha%} related
