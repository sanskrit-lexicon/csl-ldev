{@Laṅkāpraveśa@}¦ (“the entry into Laṅkā”). § 536 (cf.
Rāmopākhyānap.). Rāvaṇa made Laṅkā yet more strong
and armed his warriors. Rāma sent the monkey Aṅgada as
messenger to Rāvaṇa. Aṅgada delivered the message of
Rāma: “Release Sītā.” Rāvaṇa became furious. Aṅgada
leaped up with four Rākṣasas and then let them fall; then
he leaped over the walls of Laṅkā and informed Rāma.
Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, and Jāmbavat with monkeys
and bears attacked Laṅkā and pulled down the fortifications.
Then the host of the Rākṣasas set out at the command of
Rāvaṇa. A great battle ensued; at last Rāma withdrew his
troops (III, {@284@}).
