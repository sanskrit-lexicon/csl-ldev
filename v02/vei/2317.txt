{@Magha@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> denotes ‘bounty,’ and Maghavan<sup>2</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>the regular Vedic name for the ‘generous giver’ of bounties to
<div n="lb"/>priests. It is doubtful whether the Maghavans were more than
<div n="lb"/>this, or had any special rank as a class in Vedic society. See
<div n="lb"/>{@Sabhā.@}

<div n="lb"/>rare, occurring practically as a divine
<div n="lb"/>epithet only (of Indra, Taittirīya Saṃ-
