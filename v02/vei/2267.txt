{@Bhāvya@}¦ is the name of a patron, as it seems, in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> the form given is Bhāva-
yavya, being a patronymic of {@Svanaya,@} who is the patron of
{@Kakṣīvant.@} This combination is borne out by the Rigveda,
where Kakṣīvant and Svanaya are mentioned in the same
verse,<sup>3</sup> while Svanaya must be meant in the verse of the same
hymn,<sup>4</sup> where Bhāvya is mentioned as ‘living on the Sindhu’
(Indus). Roth's<sup>5</sup> view that Bhāvya here is perhaps a gerundive
meaning to be ‘reverenced’ is not probable. Ludwig<sup>6</sup> thinks
Svanaya was connected with the {@Nahuṣas.@}
