{@Guggulu,@}¦ ‘bdellium,’ is referred to in one passage of the
Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as produced by the Sindhu<sup>2</sup> and by the sea. The
latter source presumably alludes, as Zimmer<sup>3</sup> assumes, to sea-
borne trade, bdellium being the gum of a tree, not a product of
the sea. It is, however, possible that in this passage some
other substance may be meant. The word in this form also
occurs elsewhere in the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> and later;<sup>5</sup> it is often<sup>6</sup>
mentioned in the older form of {@Gulgulu,@} between which and
Guggulu the manuscripts constantly vary
