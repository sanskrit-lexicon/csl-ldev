{@Himavant,@}¦ ‘snowy,’ appears as an epithet of mountains in
the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> It is also used both there<sup>2</sup> and in the
Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> as well as later,<sup>4</sup> as a noun. There seems no reason
to deny that in all the passages the word refers vaguely to the
mountains now called Himālaya, though it is possible that the
name may include mountains not strictly in that system, like
the Suleiman hills.<sup>5</sup> See also {@Mūjavant@} and {@Trikakubh.@}
