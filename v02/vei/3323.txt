{@Śūdra@}¦ is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic
state (see {@Varṇa@}). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except
in the Puruṣasūkta<sup>1</sup> (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Maṇḍla,
where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the
Śudra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other
hand, knows {@Dasyu@} and {@Dāsa,@} both as aborigines independent
of Āryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to
reckon the Śūdra of the later texts as belonging to the
aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the Āryans.
Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been
regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions
when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred
quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be
used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the
aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under Āryan
lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in
Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early
cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other
hand, the term Śūdra would also cover the wild hill tribes
which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would
acknowledge the superiority of their Āryan neighbours: it
could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the Āryan
state.
<div n="P"/>This view of the Śūdra suits adequately the Vedic references
to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic
slaves only. The Śūdra is continually opposed to the Āryan,<sup>2</sup>
and the colour of the Śūdra is compared with that of the
Āryan,<sup>3</sup> just as his ways are so contrasted.<sup>4</sup> The Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> in its account of the castes, declares that the
[Page2-389+ 53]
Śūdra is {%anyasya preṣya,%} ‘the servant of another’; {%kāmotthāpya,%}
‘to be expelled at will’; and {%yathākāmavadhya,%} ‘to be slain at
will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the
serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been
applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with
but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a
grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa<sup>6</sup> explains that even if prosperous ({%bahu-paśu,%} ‘having
many cows’) a Śūdra could not be other than a servant: his
business was {%pādāvanejya,%} ‘the washing of the feet’ of his
superiors. The Mahābhārata<sup>7</sup> says out and out that a Śūdra
has no property ({%na hi svam asti śūdrasya,%} ‘the Śūdra has
nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in
England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and
limb,<sup>8</sup> so it appears that the slaying of a Śūdra involved a
wergeld of ten cows according to both Baudhāyana<sup>9</sup> and
Āpastamba.<sup>10</sup> It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was
only due in case of murder by another than the master, but
such limitation is nowhere stated.
<div n="P"/>In sacred matters the distinction between Āryan and {@Śūdra@}
was, of course, specially marked. The texts<sup>11</sup> do not hesitate
to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the Śūdras;
the Śūdra is prohibited<sup>12</sup> from milking the cow for the milk
required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> forbids a man who has been consecrated
({%dīkṣita%}) for a sacrifice to speak to a Śūdra at all for the time,
though the Śāṭyāyanaka<sup>14</sup> seems to have relaxed this rule by
confining it to cases in which the Śūdra was guilty of some sin.
[Page2-390+ 62]
At the sacrifice itself the Śūdra could not be present in the
{%śālā,%} ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the Śatapatha Brāh-
máṇa<sup>15</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> as unfit for ‘sacrifice’
({%ayajñiya%}); and declared in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup> not to be
admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory
Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact
with a Śūdra,<sup>18</sup> who here, as in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> is
reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On
the other hand, the Śūdra is one of the victims at the Puruṣa-
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>19</sup> and a fight
between an Āryan and a Śūdra, in which, of course, the former
wins, forms a part of the Mahāvrata rite, being perhaps a pre-
cursor of the Indian drama.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be
undesirable to ignore the real importance of the Śūdra, which
again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though
legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a
free man. Rich Śūdras are mentioned in the early texts,<sup>21</sup> just
as Śūdra {%gahapatis,%} ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts,
and Śūdra kings in the legal literature.<sup>22</sup> Sin against Śūdra and
Āryan is mentioned;<sup>23</sup> prayers for glory on behalf of Śūdras,
as well as of the other castes<sup>24</sup> occur; and the desire to be dear
to Śūdra as well as to Āryan is expressed.<sup>25</sup>
[Page2-391+ 71]
<div n="P"/>The Sūtras also, while they emphasize as general rules
points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in
sitting, etc.,<sup>26</sup> their exclusion from the study of the Vedas,<sup>27</sup>
the danger of contact with them<sup>28</sup> or their food,<sup>29</sup> still recog-
nize that Śūdras can be merchants,<sup>30</sup> or even exercise any
trade.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the Sūtras<sup>32</sup> permit the marriage of a Śūdrā
woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach
to {@Vatsa@}<sup>33</sup> and to {@Kavaṣa@}<sup>34</sup> that they were the sons of a Śūdrā
and a Dāsī respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach
shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover,
illicit unions of Ārya and Śūdrā, or Śūdra and Āryā, are
referred to in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the term Śūdra is quite obscure, but Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
points out that Ptolemy<sup>37</sup> mentions <lang n="greek">Σύδροι</lang> as a people, and he
thinks that the Brāhui may be meant. Without laying any
stress on this identification,<sup>38</sup> it is reasonable to accept the
[Page2-392+ 53]
view<sup>39</sup> that the term was originally the name of a large tribe
opposed to the Āryan invasion. See also {@Niṣāda.@}

<F>38) The Brāhui are now held not to be
Dravidian ethnologically, but Turco-
Iranian ({%Indian Empire,%} 1, 292, 310).
It is suggested ({%ibid.,%} 1, 382) that they
represent the original Dravidian type,
which in India has been merged in the
Muṇḍā type; but this suggestion is
invalidated by the fact that the Rigveda
speaks of the Dasyus as {%anās,%} ‘nose-
less’ ({%cf.%} {@Dasyu,@} 1, 347, n. 7). a term
admirably applicable to Dravidians,
but ludicrous as applied to the Turco-
Iranian type. It is much more plausible
to assume that the Brāhuis are a mixed
race, which in course of time has lost
most of its Dravidian features. On
the relation of Dravidians and speakers
of Muṇḍā tongues, the Vedic texts
throw no light.</F>
