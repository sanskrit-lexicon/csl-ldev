{@Ogaṇa@}¦ is a word occurring only once, as a plural, in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it appears to indicate persons hostile to the
<div n="lb"/>seer of the hymn, and apparently opposed to the Āryan religion.
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>2</sup> regards the terms as the proper name of a people, but
<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>3</sup> thinks that it is merely an adjective meaning ‘weak’
<div n="lb"/>({%ogaṇa = ava-gaṇa%}), as in Pāli.
