{@Ṛtv-ij@}¦ is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all
<div n="lb"/>the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It
<div n="lb"/>appears certain that all the priests were Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions
<div n="lb"/>was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> enumerates their names as Hotṛ, Potṛ,
<div n="lb"/>Neṣṭṛ, Agnīdh, Praśāstṛ, Adhvaryu, Brahman, besides the
<div n="lb"/>institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably
<div n="lb"/>explains the phrase ‘seven Hotṛs’ occurring so frequently in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the
<div n="lb"/>mythical ‘seven Ṛṣis.’ It may be compared with the eight of
<div n="lb"/>Iran.<sup>3</sup> The chief of the seven priests was the Hotṛ, who was
<div n="lb"/>the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer
<div n="lb"/>also. The Adhvaryu performed the practical work of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered
<div n="lb"/>formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assist-
<div n="lb"/>ance was derived from the Agnīdh, the two performing the
<div n="lb"/>smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The
<div n="lb"/>Praśāstṛ, Upavaktṛ, or Maitrāvaruṇa, as he was variously
<div n="lb"/>called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving in-
<div n="lb"/>structions to the Hotṛ, and as entrusted with certain litanies.
<div n="lb"/>The Potṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Brahman belonged to the ritual of the
<div n="lb"/>Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled Brāhmaṇāc-
<div n="lb"/>chaṃsin to distinguish him from the priest who in the later
[Page1-113+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>4</sup> are the singers of Sāmans or chants, the Udgātṛ
<div n="lb"/>and his assistant the Prastotṛ, while the Pratihartṛ, another
<div n="lb"/>assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been
<div n="lb"/>known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage
<div n="lb"/>of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use
<div n="lb"/>of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests,
<div n="lb"/>such as the Achāvāka,<sup>5</sup> the Grāvastut, the Unnetṛ, and the
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya, were known later in the developed ritual of the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically
<div n="lb"/>and artificially classed in four groups<sup>6</sup> Hotṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Achāvāka, and Grāvastut; Udgātṛ, Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, and
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya; Adhvaryu, Pratisthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Unnetṛ;
<div n="lb"/>Brahman, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, and Petṛ.
<div n="P"/>Apart from all these priests was the {@Purohita,@} who was
<div n="lb"/>the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties.
<div n="lb"/>Geldner<sup>7</sup> holds that, as a rule, when the Purohita actually
<div n="lb"/>took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of
<div n="lb"/>the Brahman, in the sense of the priest who superintended the
<div n="lb"/>whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in
<div n="lb"/>a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>later literature,<sup>9</sup> where Purohita and Brahman were combined
<div n="lb"/>or identified. Oldenberg,<sup>10</sup> however, more correctly points out
[Page1-114+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>that in the earlier period this was not the case: the Purohita
<div n="lb"/>was then normally the Hotṛ, the singer of the most important
<div n="lb"/>of the songs; it was only later that the Brahman, who in the
<div n="lb"/>capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised
<div n="lb"/>by the Purohita, who was {%ex officio%} skilled in the use of magic
<div n="lb"/>and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied
<div n="lb"/>to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees
<div n="lb"/>the fact that Agni, pre-eminently<sup>11</sup> the Purohita of men, is also
<div n="lb"/>a Hotṛ, and that the two divine Hotṛs of the Āprī hymns are
<div n="lb"/>called<sup>12</sup> the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule
<div n="lb"/>is explicitly recognized in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> that a
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya should have a Brahman as a Purohita; and in
<div n="lb"/>the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> the Vasiṣṭha family have a special
<div n="lb"/>claim to the office of Brahman-Purohita, perhaps an indi-
<div n="lb"/>cation that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the
<div n="lb"/>function of Hotṛs for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>ritual.
<div n="P"/>The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great
<div n="lb"/>majority of cases. The Sattra,<sup>15</sup> or prolonged sacrificial session,
<div n="lb"/>was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests
<div n="lb"/>taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be
<div n="lb"/>secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated
<div n="lb"/>({%dīkṣita%}). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about
<div n="lb"/>the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that
<div n="lb"/>the prayer<sup>16</sup> for welfare includes by name only the priest and
<div n="lb"/>the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with
<div n="lb"/>the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture.
<F>1) This is assumed throughout the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic texts, and is accompanied by
<div n="lb"/>the rule that no Kṣatriya can eat of
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial offering ({%Cf.%} Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, vii. 26): no doubt because
<div n="lb"/>only the Brāhmaṇas were sufficiently
<div n="lb"/>holy to receive the divine essence of
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice into which, by partaking
<div n="lb"/>of it, the deity has entered in part.</F>
