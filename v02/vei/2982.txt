{@Viś-pati@}¦ is a word of somewhat uncertain signification,
reflecting in this respect the nature of {@Viś.@} Zimmer holds that
in its strict sense it denotes the head of a canton, but he admits
that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one
quoted by him<sup>2</sup> being certainly indecisive. In the great
majority of passages the word simply means the ‘lord of the
dwelling,’ whether used of a man or of the god Agni as the
householder {%par excellence,%} or possibly as the fire of the {@Sabhā@} or
assembly house of the people. This sense suits even the
passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> in which the Viśpati, as well as the
father and the mother of a maiden,<sup>5</sup> are to be lulled to sleep in
order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may
well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the
Viśpati could easily be different from the father of the
girl — {%e.g.,%} a grandfather or uncle. In other passages<sup>6</sup> the
Viśpati is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ ({%viśām%}),
though here Zimmer<sup>7</sup> thinks reference is made to the election
of a king.<sup>8</sup> Or again,<sup>7</sup> the Viśpati is the chief of the Viś,
probably in the sense of ‘subjects.’

where Viś must clearly be the people
or subject class, and the Viśpati their
chief representative; we cannot from
such a passage infer a formal office of
Viśpati even as head of the Viś.

{%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 55 {%et seq.,%} accepts
the view of the Bṛhaddevatā, vi. 11
{%et seq.%} (where see Macdonell's note),
that the hymn refers to Vasiṣṭha's
approaching a house as a thief! The
interpretation does not affect the sense
of Viśpati, which here is clearly not
the title of a cantonal chief. Viś is
