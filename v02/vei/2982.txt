{@Viś-pati@}¦ is a word of somewhat uncertain signification,
<div n="lb"/>reflecting in this respect the nature of {@Viś.@} Zimmer holds that
<div n="lb"/>in its strict sense it denotes the head of a canton, but he admits
<div n="lb"/>that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one
<div n="lb"/>quoted by him<sup>2</sup> being certainly indecisive. In the great
<div n="lb"/>majority of passages the word simply means the ‘lord of the
<div n="lb"/>dwelling,’ whether used of a man or of the god Agni as the
<div n="lb"/>householder {%par excellence,%} or possibly as the fire of the {@Sabhā@} or
<div n="lb"/>assembly house of the people. This sense suits even the
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> in which the Viśpati, as well as the
<div n="lb"/>father and the mother of a maiden,<sup>5</sup> are to be lulled to sleep in
<div n="lb"/>order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may
<div n="lb"/>well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the
<div n="lb"/>Viśpati could easily be different from the father of the
<div n="lb"/>girl — {%e.g.,%} a grandfather or uncle. In other passages<sup>6</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Viśpati is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ ({%viśām%}),
<div n="lb"/>though here Zimmer<sup>7</sup> thinks reference is made to the election
<div n="lb"/>of a king.<sup>8</sup> Or again,<sup>7</sup> the Viśpati is the chief of the Viś,
<div n="lb"/>probably in the sense of ‘subjects.’

<div n="P"/>9) {%E.g.,%} Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1, 3,
<div n="lb"/>where Viś must clearly be the people
<div n="lb"/>or subject class, and the Viśpati their
<div n="lb"/>chief representative; we cannot from
<div n="lb"/>such a passage infer a formal office of
<div n="lb"/>Viśpati even as head of the Viś.

<div n="lb"/>Lanman, {%Sanskrit Reader,%} 370. Geldner,

<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%} (where see Macdonell's note),
<div n="lb"/>that the hymn refers to Vasiṣṭha's
<div n="lb"/>approaching a house as a thief! The
<div n="lb"/>interpretation does not affect the sense
<div n="lb"/>of Viśpati, which here is clearly not
<div n="lb"/>the title of a cantonal chief. Viś is
