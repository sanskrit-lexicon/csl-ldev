{@Jyotiṣa,@}¦ ‘astronomy.’ It is important to note that no refer-
ence to any work on astronomy occurs in the Saṃhitās or
Brāhmaṇas. The text which claims to represent the astro-
nomical science of the Veda has been edited by Weber,<sup>1</sup> and
has frequently been discussed since.<sup>2</sup> Its date is unknown, but
is undoubtedly late, as is shown alike by the contents and form
of the work.
