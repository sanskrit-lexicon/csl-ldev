{@Cedi@}¦ is the name of a people who, with their king {@Kaśu,@} the
Caidya, are mentioned only in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’),
occurring at the end of one hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where their
generosity is celebrated as unsurpassed. They occur later in
the Epic with the {@Matsyas,@} and lived in Bandela Khaṇḍa
(Bundelkhand).<sup>2</sup> In Vedic times they were probably situated
in much the same locality.
