{@Manā@}¦ is found in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> in an enumera-
<div n="lb"/>tion of gifts, where it is described as ‘golden’ ({%sacā manā%}
<div n="lb"/>{%hiraṇyayā%}). It therefore seems to designate some ornament, or
<div n="lb"/>possibly a weight, and has accordingly been compared<sup>2</sup> with
<div n="lb"/>the Greek <lang n="greek">μνᾶ</lang> (Herodotus has <lang n="greek">μνέα</lang>), the Latin {%mina.%} All three
<div n="lb"/>words have been considered Semitic in origin, as borrowed from
<div n="lb"/>the Phœnicians<sup>3</sup> in the case of Greece, from Carthage by way
[Page2-129+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>of Etruria or Sicily in the case of Rome, and from Babylon in
<div n="lb"/>the case of India. The identification as regards Manā is very
<div n="lb"/>conjectural, depending merely on the probabilities of Babylonian
<div n="lb"/>borrowing<sup>4</sup> seen — {%e.g.,%} in the legend of the flood, and in the
<div n="lb"/>system of the {@Nakṣatras.@} On the other hand, Mahā may very
<div n="lb"/>well be identical with the word {%manā%} which occurs several
<div n="lb"/>times in the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> in the sense of ‘desire’ (from the root
<div n="lb"/>{%man,%} ‘think’), and which may have in this one passage the
<div n="lb"/>concrete sense of ‘desirable object.’ It is to be noted that in
<div n="lb"/>Böhtlingk's Dictionary a single word Manā appears, to which
<div n="lb"/>the only senses assigned are ‘wish,’ ‘desire,’ ‘jealousy.’
