{@Aja.@}¦ — The Ajas are named in one verse of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>having been defeated by the {@Tṛtsus@} under {@Sudās.@} They are
<div n="lb"/>there mentioned with the {@Yakṣus@} and {@Śigrus,@} and Zimmer<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>conjectures that they formed part of a confederacy under
<div n="lb"/>Bheda against Sudās. The name has been regarded as a sign
<div n="lb"/>of totemism,<sup>3</sup> but this is very uncertain, and it is impossible to
<div n="lb"/>say if they were or were not Āryans.
