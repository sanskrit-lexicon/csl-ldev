{@Ārtava.@}¦ — This expression denotes a portion of the year
consisting of more seasons than one. But it does not bear the
exact sense of ‘half-year,’ as suggested by Zimmer.<sup>1</sup> This is
shown by the fact that it occurs regularly in the plural, not in
the dual. In the Atharvaveda it occurs between seasons and
years ({%hāyana%}),<sup>2</sup> but also in the combinations, ‘seasons, Ārtavas,
months, years,;<sup>3</sup> ‘half-months, months, Ārtavas, seasons’;<sup>4</sup>
[Page1-064+ 61]
‘seasons, Ārtavas, months, half-months, days and nights, day’;<sup>5</sup>
and in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā ‘months, seasons, Ārtavas, the
year,’<sup>6</sup> or simply with the seasons.<sup>7</sup>
