{@Pīṭha,@}¦ ‘stool,’ does not occur as an uncompounded word
before the Sūtras, but the compound {%pīṭha-sarpin%} (‘moving
about in a little cart’) is found as the designation of a ‘cripple’
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxx. 21) and the Taittirīya Brāh-
maṇa (iii. 4, 17, 1) in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
(‘human sacrifice’).
