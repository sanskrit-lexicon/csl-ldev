{@Kanā, Kanyā.@}¦ — Both these words, of which the former is
very rare,<sup>1</sup> while the latter is the normal term from the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
onwards, denote ‘maiden’ or ‘young woman.’ It is doubtful
whether Kanīnakā (accented on the final syllable) has this
meaning,<sup>3</sup> or only denotes the pupil of the eye,<sup>4</sup> which is the
sense of {%kanīnakā%} or {%kanīnikā%} (both accented on the ante-
penultimate) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. See
also {@Strī.@}

clear.</F>
