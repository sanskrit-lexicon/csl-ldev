{@Bharata@}¦ is the name of a people of great importance in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda and the later literature. In the Rigveda they appear
<div n="lb"/>prominently in the third and seventh Maṇḍalas in connexion
[Page2-095+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>with {@Sudās@} and the {@Tṛtsus,@}<sup>1</sup> while in the sixth Maṇḍala they
<div n="lb"/>are associated with {@Divodāsa.@}<sup>2</sup> In one passage<sup>3</sup> the Bharatas
<div n="lb"/>are, like the Tṛtsus, enemies of the {@Pūrus:@} there can be little
<div n="lb"/>doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and
<div n="lb"/>and Tṛtsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>considers that the Tṛtsus are the {@Vasiṣṭhas,@} the family singers
<div n="lb"/>of the Bharatas; while Geldner<sup>6</sup> recognizes, with perhaps more
<div n="lb"/>probability, in the Tṛtsus the royal family of the Bharatas.
<div n="lb"/>That the Tṛtsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus in Zimmer's view<sup>8</sup> occupied the country to the east of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as coming against the Tṛtsus from the west, whereas
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> recognizes two Bharata chiefs on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Āpayā,@} and {@Dṛṣadvatī@} — that is, in the holy land of India, the
<div n="lb"/>{@Madhyadeśa.@} Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup> sees in the connexion of the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not
<div n="lb"/>supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion
<div n="lb"/>some such theory is needed to explain Divodāsa's appearing in
<div n="lb"/>connexion with the {@Bharadvāja@} family, while Sudās, his son,
<div n="P"/>^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172
<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%}
[Page2-096+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>or perhaps grandson ({%cf.%} {@Pijavana@}), is connected with the
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭhas and the {@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially
<div n="lb"/>famous. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
<div n="lb"/>ṣanti as a king, sacrificer of the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
<div n="lb"/>and {@Śatānīka Sātrājita,@} as another Bharata who offered that
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
<div n="lb"/>ṣanti as receiving the kingly coronation from {@Dīrghatamas@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Māmateya,@} and Śatānīka as being consecrated by {@Somaśuṣman@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vājaratnāyana,@} a priest whose name is of quite late origin.
<div n="lb"/>The geographical position of the Bharata people is clearly
<div n="lb"/>shown by the fact that the Bharata kings win victories over the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kāśis,@} and make offerings on the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna) and {@Gaṅgā@}
<div n="lb"/>(Ganges).<sup>13</sup> Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclama-
<div n="lb"/>tion for the people, the variants recorded<sup>14</sup> include {%Kuravaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ,%} and {%Bharatāḥ;%} and the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>consistently recognizes the royal family of the {@Kurus@} as a
<div n="lb"/>Bharata family.<sup>15</sup> It is therefore extremely probable that
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times
<div n="lb"/>of the Brāhmaṇas were merging in the Kuru-Pañcāla people.
<div n="P"/>The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>17</sup> the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>18</sup> the
[Page2-097+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>19</sup> and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>20</sup> Already
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda<sup>21</sup> there is mention made of Agni Bhārata (‘of
<div n="lb"/>the Bharatas’). In the Āprī hymns<sup>22</sup> occurs a goddess
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratī, the personified divine protective power of the
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas: her association in the hymns with Sarasvatī reflects
<div n="lb"/>the connexion of the Bharatas with the Sarasvatī in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>9</sup> Again, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>23</sup> Agni is
<div n="lb"/>referred to as {%brāhmaṇa Bhārata,%} ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and
<div n="lb"/>is invited to dispose of the offering {%Manuṣvat Bharatavat,%} ‘like
<div n="lb"/>Manu,’ ‘like Bharata.’<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>In one or two passages<sup>25</sup> Sudās or Divodāsa and, on the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, Purukutsa or Trasadasyu appear in a friendly
<div n="lb"/>relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg<sup>26</sup> suggests, to the
<div n="lb"/>union of Bharatas and Pūrus with the Kurus.
<div n="P"/>A Bharata is referred to in the fifth Maṇḍala of the Rig-
<div n="lb"/>veda:<sup>27</sup> who he was is uncertain.

<div n="lb"/>vii. 8, 4; 33, 6, in which passage a
<div n="lb"/>defeat of the Bharatas, and their rescue
<div n="lb"/>by the aid of Vasiṣṭha, is clearly referred
<div n="lb"/>to; not, as was formerly thought ({%e.g.,%}
<div n="lb"/>Muir, {%Sanskrit Texts,%} 12, 354; Zimmer,

<div n="lb"/>view is that Sudās and the Bharatas
<div n="lb"/>were later comers than the Tṛtsus, who
<div n="lb"/>joined them as one people, the Vasiṣṭhas
<div n="lb"/>becoming the priests of the Bharatas.
<div n="lb"/>He suggests that the Vasiṣṭhas were
<div n="lb"/>not originally adherents of the Indra-
<div n="lb"/>Soma cult, but were specially devoted
<div n="lb"/>to the Varuṇa cult; but there is
<div n="lb"/>no decisive evidence for either sug-

<div n="lb"/>there is no mention of the Bharatas in

<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa (viii. 14). in the Mānava
<div n="lb"/>Dharma Śāstra, or in the Buddhist
