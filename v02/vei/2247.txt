{@Bhāga-dugha,@}¦ ‘dealer out of portions,’ ‘distributor,’ is the
name of one of the king's ‘jewels’ ({@Ratnin@}) in the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup> What his functions exactly were
is uncertain. Sāyaṇa in some places<sup>3</sup> renders the word by
‘tax-collector’ but in others<sup>4</sup> as ‘carver,’ thus making this
functionary either a revenue officer or a mere court official.
