1. {@Śakti@}¦ is said in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> to have been
<div n="lb"/>the son of {@Vasiṣṭha,@} and to have been cast into the fire by the
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvāmitras.@} According to Ṣaḍguruśiṣya,<sup>2</sup> who appears to
<div n="lb"/>follow the Śāṭyāyanaka,<sup>3</sup> the story of Śakti is as follows:
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra, being defeated in a contest by Śakti, had recourse
[Page2-349+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>to {@Jamadagni,@} who taught him the {@Sasarparī;@} later he
<div n="lb"/>revenged himself on Śakti by having him burnt in the forest.
<div n="lb"/>The Bṛhaddevatā<sup>4</sup> relates the first part of the tale only.
<div n="lb"/>Geldner<sup>5</sup> sees in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> a description of the death
<div n="lb"/>struggle of Śakti, but this interpretation is more than doubtful.<sup>7</sup>
