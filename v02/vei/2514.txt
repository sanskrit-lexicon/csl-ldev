{@Mṛgayu,@}¦ ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas,<sup>2</sup> but not very often. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> however, in the list of victims
<div n="lb"/>at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of
<div n="lb"/>names which seem to be those of persons who make a liveli-
<div n="lb"/>hood by fishing or by hunting, such as the {@Mārgāra,@} ‘hunter,’
[Page2-173+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>the {@Kaivarta@} or {@Kevarta, Pauñjiṣṭha, Daśa, Maināla,@} ‘fisher
<div n="lb"/>man,’ and perhaps the {@Bainda@} and the Ānda,<sup>5</sup> who seem to
<div n="lb"/>have been some sort of fishermen.
<div n="P"/>It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period
<div n="lb"/>hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture ({@Kṛṣi@}) were, no
<div n="lb"/>doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be
<div n="lb"/>unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done,
<div n="lb"/>both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for
<div n="lb"/>protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally
<div n="lb"/>our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The
<div n="lb"/>arrow was sometimes employed,<sup>6</sup> but, as is usual with primitive
<div n="lb"/>man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls.
<div n="lb"/>Birds were regularly caught in nets ({@Pāśa,@}<sup>7</sup> {@Nidhā,@}<sup>8</sup> {@Jāla@}),<sup>9</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>bird-catcher being called {%nidhā-pati,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘master of snares.’ The
<div n="lb"/>net was fastened on pegs<sup>11</sup> (as is done with modern nets for
<div n="lb"/>catching birds). Another name of net is apparently {@Mukṣījā.@}
<div n="P"/>Pits were used for catching antelopes ({@Ṛśya@}), and so were
<div n="lb"/>called {%ṛśya-da,%}<sup>12</sup> ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured
<div n="lb"/>as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame
<div n="lb"/>females (see {@Mṛga Hastin@}). Apparently the boar was captured
<div n="lb"/>in the chase, dogs being used,<sup>13</sup> but the passage from which
<div n="lb"/>this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content.
<div n="lb"/>There is also an obscure reference<sup>14</sup> to the capture of the
<div n="lb"/>buffalo ({@Gaura@}), but it is not clear whether the reference is to
<div n="lb"/>shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes,
<div n="lb"/>perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls,<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or was surrounded by the hunters and slain;<sup>16</sup> one very obscure
<div n="lb"/>passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which
<div n="lb"/>perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit.<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only
<div n="lb"/>evidence available are the explanations of the various names
[Page2-174+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Yajurveda. Sāyaṇa<sup>18</sup> says that {@Dhaivara@} is
<div n="lb"/>one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; Dāśa and
<div n="lb"/>{@Śauṣkala@} do so by means of a fish-hook ({%baḍiśa%}); Bainda,
<div n="lb"/>Kaivarta, and Maināla by means of a net ({%jāla%}); Mārgāra
<div n="lb"/>catches fish in the water with his hands; Ānda by putting in
<div n="lb"/>pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); {@Parṇaka@}
<div n="lb"/>by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these
<div n="lb"/>explanations can claim much authority.
