{@Mṛgayu,@}¦ ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and the
Brāhmaṇas,<sup>2</sup> but not very often. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> however, in the list of victims
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of
names which seem to be those of persons who make a liveli-
hood by fishing or by hunting, such as the {@Mārgāra,@} ‘hunter,’
[Page2-173+ 47]
the {@Kaivarta@} or {@Kevarta, Pauñjiṣṭha, Daśa, Maināla,@} ‘fisher
man,’ and perhaps the {@Bainda@} and the Ānda,<sup>5</sup> who seem to
have been some sort of fishermen.
<div n="P"/>It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period
hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the
Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture ({@Kṛṣi@}) were, no
doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be
unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done,
both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for
protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally
our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The
arrow was sometimes employed,<sup>6</sup> but, as is usual with primitive
man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls.
Birds were regularly caught in nets ({@Pāśa,@}<sup>7</sup> {@Nidhā,@}<sup>8</sup> {@Jāla@}),<sup>9</sup> The
bird-catcher being called {%nidhā-pati,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘master of snares.’ The
net was fastened on pegs<sup>11</sup> (as is done with modern nets for
catching birds). Another name of net is apparently {@Mukṣījā.@}
<div n="P"/>Pits were used for catching antelopes ({@Ṛśya@}), and so were
called {%ṛśya-da,%}<sup>12</sup> ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured
as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame
females (see {@Mṛga Hastin@}). Apparently the boar was captured
in the chase, dogs being used,<sup>13</sup> but the passage from which
this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content.
There is also an obscure reference<sup>14</sup> to the capture of the
buffalo ({@Gaura@}), but it is not clear whether the reference is to
shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes,
perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls,<sup>15</sup>
or was surrounded by the hunters and slain;<sup>16</sup> one very obscure
passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which
perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit.<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only
evidence available are the explanations of the various names
[Page2-174+ 45]
mentioned in the Yajurveda. Sāyaṇa<sup>18</sup> says that {@Dhaivara@} is
one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; Dāśa and
{@Śauṣkala@} do so by means of a fish-hook ({%baḍiśa%}); Bainda,
Kaivarta, and Maināla by means of a net ({%jāla%}); Mārgāra
catches fish in the water with his hands; Ānda by putting in
pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); {@Parṇaka@}
by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these
explanations can claim much authority.
