{@Arcanānas.@}¦ — In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the gods Mitra-
Varuṇa are besought to protect Arcanānas. He is also in-
voked with {@Śyāvāśva@} and several other ancestors enumerated
in the Atharvaveda.<sup>2</sup> He appears as father of Śyāvāśva in the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> The later tradition makes him play a
part in the legend of his son's wedding, which Sieg<sup>4</sup> endeavours
to show is known to the Rigveda.
