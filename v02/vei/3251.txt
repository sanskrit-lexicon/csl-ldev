{@Śāryāta,@}¦ perhaps ‘descendant of {@Śaryāta,@}’ is the name of a
<div n="lb"/>singer in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> A Śāryāta appears also in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> with the patronymic {@Mānava@} as the seer of a
<div n="lb"/>Rigvedic hymn,<sup>3</sup> and as having been anointed by {@Cyavana.@}<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The same man is evidently meant by Śaryāta in the story of
<div n="lb"/>Cyavana in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> and the Jaiminīya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa.<sup>6</sup> In both these passages the Śāryātas are mentioned as
<div n="lb"/>his descendants, and his daughter is called Śāryātī.
