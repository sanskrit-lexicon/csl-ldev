{@Abhy-agni Aitaśāyana.@}¦ — This man was, according to the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> unfortunate enough to quarrel with his
father, {@Aitaśa.@} The result was that he and his progeny were
called the worst of the {@Aurvas.@} In the version of the Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the {@Aitaśāyana Ājāneyas@} take the place of the
Abhyagnis and the {@Bhṛgus@} of the {@Aurvas,@} the latter being
probably a branch of the former family.
