{@Bṛhad-uktha@}¦ is mentioned in an obscure hymn of the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a priest; in two hymns of the tenth Maṇḍala<sup>2</sup> he
is definitely a Ṛṣi. He is also mentioned in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> as having consecrated {@Durmukha Pāñcāla,@} and
is called {@Vāmadeva's@} son in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup> In the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> he appears as {@Vāmneya,@} ‘descendant
of Vāmnī.’ Hopkins<sup>6</sup> suggestion that he may have been there
thought of as Vāmadevya also is quite probable.<sup>7</sup>
