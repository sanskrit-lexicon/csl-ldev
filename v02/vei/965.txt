{@Cākra@}¦ is the name of a man, variously styled Revottaras
Sthapati Pāṭava Cākra<sup>1</sup> and Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati,<sup>2</sup>
who is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa only. He is
there said to have been expelled by the {@Sṛñjayas,@} but to have
restored to them their prince {@Duṣṭarītu@} despite the opposition
of the Kauravya king {@Balhika Prātipīya.@}<sup>2</sup> He must have been
a sage rather than a warrior, as the first passage of the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> shows him in the capacity of a teacher only. {%Cf.%}
