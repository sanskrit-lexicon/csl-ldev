{@Bhurij@}¦ (used in the dual only) is a word of somewhat
doubtful sense. Roth<sup>1</sup> regarded it as meaning in some
passages<sup>2</sup> ‘scissors,’ and in others<sup>3</sup> an apparatus consisting of
two arms used by the chariot-maker for fixing the wood at
which he worked, being of the nature of a carpenter's vice. See

where Pischel, {%Vedische Studien,%} 1, 239-
243, considers that the shafts of the
chariot are meant ({%cf.%} Gobhila Gṛhya
Sūtra, iii. 4, 31, whence it appears that
the chariot-pole, spoken of as having
two arms, was forked). The same view
regarding the passages cited in n. 2
gives the sense of a stropping apparatus,
consisting of two pieces of wood, be-
tween which a grindstone moves.
