{@Ni-ṣaṅgathi@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Niṣaṅga-dhi@}<sup>2</sup> is found in the Yajurveda
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās. If the second form of the word is correct, the sense
<div n="lb"/>may be ‘sheath of a sword’ ({%niṣaṅga%}), as it is taken by the
<div n="lb"/>St. Petersburg Dictionary, but probably the first form is the
<div n="lb"/>correct one, the word then having the same meaning as
<div n="lb"/>{@Niṣaṅgin.@}
