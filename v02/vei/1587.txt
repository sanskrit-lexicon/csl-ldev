{@Ni-ṣaṅgathi@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Niṣaṅga-dhi@}<sup>2</sup> is found in the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās. If the second form of the word is correct, the sense
may be ‘sheath of a sword’ ({%niṣaṅga%}), as it is taken by the
St. Petersburg Dictionary, but probably the first form is the
correct one, the word then having the same meaning as
{@Niṣaṅgin.@}
