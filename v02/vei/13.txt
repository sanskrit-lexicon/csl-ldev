{@Agni-dagdha.@}¦ — This epithet (‘burnt with fire’)<sup>1</sup> applies to
<div n="lb"/>the dead who were burned on the funeral pyre. This is one
<div n="lb"/>of the two normal methods of disposing of the dead, the other
<div n="lb"/>being burial ({%an-agnidagdhāḥ,%} ‘not burnt with fire’).<sup>2</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> adds two further modes of disposal to those — 
<div n="lb"/>viz., casting out ({%paroptāḥ%}), and the exposure of the dead
<div n="lb"/>({%uddhitāḥ%}). The exact sense of these expressions is doubtful.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>4</sup> considers that the former is a parallel to the Iranian
<div n="lb"/>practice of casting out the dead to be devoured by beasts, and
<div n="lb"/>that the latter refers to the old who are exposed when helpless.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Whitney<sup>6</sup> refers the latter expression to the exposure of the
<div n="lb"/>dead body on a raised platform of some sort.
<div n="P"/>Burial was clearly not rare in the Rigvedic period: a whole
<div n="lb"/>hymn<sup>7</sup> describes the ritual attending it. The dead man was
<div n="lb"/>buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and
<div n="lb"/>probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany
<div n="lb"/>him, in accordance with a practice common among savage
<div n="lb"/>tribes. But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a
<div n="lb"/>modified form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the
<div n="lb"/>dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband
<div n="lb"/>by his brother or other nearest kinsman. A stone is set
<div n="lb"/>between the dead and the living to separate them. In the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> but not in the Rigveda, a coffin ({%vṛkṣa%}) is alluded
<div n="lb"/>to. In both Saṃhitās<sup>9</sup> occur other allusions to the ‘house
<div n="lb"/>of earth’ ({%bhūmi-gṛha%}). To remove the apparent discrepancy
<div n="lb"/>between burning and burial, by assuming that the references to
<div n="lb"/>burial are to the burial of the burned bones, as does Oldenberg,<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>is unnecessary and improbable, as burning and burial subsisted
<div n="lb"/>side by side in Greece for many years.
<div n="P"/>Burning was, however, equally usual, and it grew steadily
<div n="lb"/>in frequency, for in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>11</sup> the adornment
[Page1-009+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>of the body of the dead with curd ({@Āmikṣā@}), clothes, and
<div n="lb"/>ornaments, in order to win the next world, is referred to as
<div n="lb"/>something erroneous and wrong, and in the funeral Mantras of
<div n="lb"/>the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>12</sup> only burning seems to be contemplated;
<div n="lb"/>the verses which refer to burial here really alluding to the burial
<div n="lb"/>of the ashes in the burying-ground ({%śmaśāna%}).<sup>13</sup> The body was
<div n="lb"/>wrapped in fat,<sup>14</sup> as we learn from the funeral hymn in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, a goat being apparently burned with it,<sup>15</sup> to act as
<div n="lb"/>a guide on the way to the next world. According to the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>16</sup> a draft-ox was burned presumably for the dead
<div n="lb"/>to ride with in the next world. It was expected that the dead
<div n="lb"/>would revive with his whole body and all his limbs ({%sarva-tanūḥ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%sāṅgaḥ%}),<sup>17</sup> although it is also said<sup>18</sup> that the eye goes to the sun,
<div n="lb"/>the breath to the wind, and so forth.
<div n="P"/>Before burial or burning, the corpse was washed,<sup>19</sup> a clog
<div n="lb"/>({%kūdī%}) being tied to the foot to prevent the deceased returning
<div n="lb"/>to earth.<sup>20</sup>
