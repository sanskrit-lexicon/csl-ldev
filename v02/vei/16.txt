{@Aghā.@}¦ — In the wedding hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> it is said that
cows are slain in the Aghās, and the wedding takes place at the
{@Arjunīs@} (dual). The Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> has the ordinary {@Maghās@}
instead. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the read-
ing of the Rigveda was deliberately altered because of the con-
nection of the slaughter of kine with sin ({%agha%}) — possibly, too,
with a further desire to emphasize the contrast with {%aghnyā,%}
a name for ‘cow.’ Moreover, in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup>
occurs the formula ‘Svāhā to the Maghās, Svāhā to the
Anaghās.’ See also {@Nakṣatra.@}
