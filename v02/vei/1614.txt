{@Naicā-śākha@}¦ is found in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
Sāyaṇa renders it as ‘of low origin,’ but elsewhere<sup>2</sup> he explains
it as the name of a place. The former sense is accepted by
Grassmann and Ludwig in their versions, and by Zimmer,<sup>3</sup>
but Hillebrandt<sup>4</sup> points out that the reference is rather to the
‘low-branched’ Soma plant. {%Cf.%} {@Kīkaṭa@} and {@Pramaganda.@}
