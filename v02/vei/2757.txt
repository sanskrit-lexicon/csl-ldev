{@Lodha@}¦ occurs in a very obscure verse of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
Roth<sup>2</sup> conjectures that some sort of ‘red’ animal is meant, and
Oldenberg<sup>3</sup> shows some reason for thinking that a ‘red goat’ is
intended.
<F>1) iii. 53, 23.</F>
<F>2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.%}</F>
<F>3) {%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} 1, 255.
<div n="P"/>{%Cf.%} the obscure {%adhī-lodha-karṇa%} in
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 16, 1,
perhaps meaning ‘having quite red
ears.’ Yāska, Nirukta, iv. 12, equates
the word with {%lubdha,%} ‘confused,’ but
this does not suit the context. So also
Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 84; Geldner,
{%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 160; {%Ṛgveda, Glossar,%}
151, who sees in the word the designa-
tion of a noble steed.</F>
