{@Kṛṣi,@}¦ ‘ploughing.’ The cultivation of the soil was no doubt
<div n="lb"/>known to the Indians before they separated from the Iranians,
<div n="lb"/>as is indicated by the identity of the expressions {%yavaṃ kṛṣ%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%sasya%} in the Rigveda with {%yao karesh%} and {%hahya%} in the Avesta,
<div n="lb"/>referring to the ploughing in of the seed and to the grain
<div n="lb"/>which resulted.<sup>1</sup> But it is not without significance that the
<div n="lb"/>expressions for ploughing occur mainly in the first<sup>2</sup> and tenth<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>books of the Rigveda, and only rarely in the so-called ‘family’
<div n="lb"/>books (ii.-vii.).<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda {@Pṛthī Vainya@} is credited
<div n="lb"/>with the origination of ploughing,<sup>5</sup> and even in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>the Aśvins are spoken of as concerned with the sowing of grain
<div n="lb"/>by means of the plough.<sup>6</sup> In the later Saṃhitās and the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas ploughing is repeatedly referred to.<sup>7</sup>
[Page1-182+ 51]
<div n="P"/>Even in the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> there is clear proof of the importance
<div n="lb"/>attached to agriculture. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>{@Vrātyas,@} Hindus without the pale of Brahminism, are de-
<div n="lb"/>scribed as not cultivating the soil.
<div n="P"/>The plough land was called {@Urvarā@} or {@Kṣetra;@} manure
<div n="lb"/>({@Śakan, Karīṣa@}) was used, and irrigation was practised ({@Khani-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@tra@}). The plough ({@Lāṅgala, Sīra@}) was drawn by oxen, teams of
<div n="lb"/>six, eight, or even twelve being employed.<sup>10</sup> The operations of
<div n="lb"/>agriculture are neatly summed up in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as ‘ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing’ ({%kṛṣantaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vapantaḥ, lunantaḥ, mṛṇantaḥ%}). The ripe grain was cut with
<div n="lb"/>a sickle ({@Dātra, Sṛṇi@}), bound into bundles<sup>12</sup> ({@Parṣa@}), and beaten
<div n="lb"/>out on the floor of the granary ({@Khala@}).<sup>13</sup> The grain was then
<div n="lb"/>separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve ({@Titau@})
<div n="lb"/>or a winnowing fan ({@Śūrpa@}).<sup>14</sup> The winnower was called
<div n="lb"/>{@Dhānyākṛt,@}<sup>15</sup> and the grain was measured in a vessel called
<div n="lb"/>{@Urdara.@}<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain
<div n="lb"/>grown, for {@Yava@} is a word of doubtful signification, and {@Dhānā@}
<div n="lb"/>is also vague. In the later Saṃhitās<sup>17</sup> things are different.
<div n="lb"/>Rice ({@Vrīhi@}) appears, Yava means barley, with a species
<div n="lb"/>styled {@Upavāka.@} Beans ({@Mudga, Māṣa@}), sesamum ({@Tila@}), and
<div n="lb"/>other grains ({@Aṇu, Khalva, Godhūma, Nīvāra, Priyaṅgu,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Masūra, Śyāmāka@}) are mentioned, while cucumbers ({@Urvārū,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Uryārūka@}) were known. It is uncertain whether fruit trees
<div n="lb"/>({@Vṛkṣa@}) were cultivated, or merely grew wild;<sup>18</sup> but frequent
<div n="lb"/>mention is made of the jujube ({@Karkandhu, Kuvala, Badara.@}).
<div n="P"/>The seasons for agriculture are briefly summed up in a
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā:<sup>19</sup> barley ripened in summer,
<div n="lb"/>being no doubt sown, as in modern India, in winter; rice
[Page1-183+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>ripened in autumn, being sown in the beginning of the rains;
<div n="lb"/>beans and sesamum, planted at the time of the summer rains,
<div n="lb"/>ripened in the winter and the cool season. There were two
<div n="lb"/>harvests ({@Sasya@}) a year according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the winter crop was ripe by the month of Caitra (March-April)
<div n="lb"/>according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The farmer had plenty of trouble of his own: moles destroyed
<div n="lb"/>the seed, birds and various kinds of reptiles ({@Upakvasa, Jabhya,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Tarda, Pataṅga@}) injured the young shoots, excessive rain or
<div n="lb"/>drought might damage the crops. The Atharvaveda contains
<div n="lb"/>spells to prevent these evils.<sup>22</sup>
