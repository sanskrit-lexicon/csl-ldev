{@Kṛṣi,@}¦ ‘ploughing.’ The cultivation of the soil was no doubt
known to the Indians before they separated from the Iranians,
as is indicated by the identity of the expressions {%yavaṃ kṛṣ%} and
{%sasya%} in the Rigveda with {%yao karesh%} and {%hahya%} in the Avesta,
referring to the ploughing in of the seed and to the grain
which resulted.<sup>1</sup> But it is not without significance that the
expressions for ploughing occur mainly in the first<sup>2</sup> and tenth<sup>3</sup>
books of the Rigveda, and only rarely in the so-called ‘family’
books (ii.-vii.).<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda {@Pṛthī Vainya@} is credited
with the origination of ploughing,<sup>5</sup> and even in the Rigveda
the Aśvins are spoken of as concerned with the sowing of grain
by means of the plough.<sup>6</sup> In the later Saṃhitās and the
Brāhmaṇas ploughing is repeatedly referred to.<sup>7</sup>
[Page1-182+ 51]
<div n="P"/>Even in the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> there is clear proof of the importance
attached to agriculture. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> the
{@Vrātyas,@} Hindus without the pale of Brahminism, are de-
scribed as not cultivating the soil.
<div n="P"/>The plough land was called {@Urvarā@} or {@Kṣetra;@} manure
({@Śakan, Karīṣa@}) was used, and irrigation was practised ({@Khani-@}
{@tra@}). The plough ({@Lāṅgala, Sīra@}) was drawn by oxen, teams of
six, eight, or even twelve being employed.<sup>10</sup> The operations of
agriculture are neatly summed up in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup>
as ‘ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing’ ({%kṛṣantaḥ,%}
{%vapantaḥ, lunantaḥ, mṛṇantaḥ%}). The ripe grain was cut with
a sickle ({@Dātra, Sṛṇi@}), bound into bundles<sup>12</sup> ({@Parṣa@}), and beaten
out on the floor of the granary ({@Khala@}).<sup>13</sup> The grain was then
separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve ({@Titau@})
or a winnowing fan ({@Śūrpa@}).<sup>14</sup> The winnower was called
{@Dhānyākṛt,@}<sup>15</sup> and the grain was measured in a vessel called
{@Urdara.@}<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain
grown, for {@Yava@} is a word of doubtful signification, and {@Dhānā@}
is also vague. In the later Saṃhitās<sup>17</sup> things are different.
Rice ({@Vrīhi@}) appears, Yava means barley, with a species
styled {@Upavāka.@} Beans ({@Mudga, Māṣa@}), sesamum ({@Tila@}), and
other grains ({@Aṇu, Khalva, Godhūma, Nīvāra, Priyaṅgu,@}
{@Masūra, Śyāmāka@}) are mentioned, while cucumbers ({@Urvārū,@}
{@Uryārūka@}) were known. It is uncertain whether fruit trees
({@Vṛkṣa@}) were cultivated, or merely grew wild;<sup>18</sup> but frequent
mention is made of the jujube ({@Karkandhu, Kuvala, Badara.@}).
<div n="P"/>The seasons for agriculture are briefly summed up in a
passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā:<sup>19</sup> barley ripened in summer,
being no doubt sown, as in modern India, in winter; rice
[Page1-183+ 52]
ripened in autumn, being sown in the beginning of the rains;
beans and sesamum, planted at the time of the summer rains,
ripened in the winter and the cool season. There were two
harvests ({@Sasya@}) a year according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>20</sup>
the winter crop was ripe by the month of Caitra (March-April)
according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The farmer had plenty of trouble of his own: moles destroyed
the seed, birds and various kinds of reptiles ({@Upakvasa, Jabhya,@}
{@Tarda, Pataṅga@}) injured the young shoots, excessive rain or
drought might damage the crops. The Atharvaveda contains
spells to prevent these evils.<sup>22</sup>
