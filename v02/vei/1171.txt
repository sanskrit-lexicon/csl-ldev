{@Turvaśa@}¦ occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of
a man or of a people, usually in connexion with {@Yadu.@} The
two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting
particle, {%Turvaśa Yadu%} or {%Yadu Turvaśa.%}<sup>2</sup> In a plural form
the name Turvaśa occurs once with the Yadus,<sup>3</sup> and once
alone<sup>4</sup> in a hymn in which the singular has already been used.
In one passage<sup>5</sup> the dual {%Turvaśā-Yadū%} actually occurs, and
in another<sup>6</sup> {%Yadus Turvaś ca,%} ‘Yadu and Turva.’ In other
passages<sup>7</sup> Turvaśa appears alone, while in one<sup>8</sup> Turvaśa and
Yādva occur.
<div n="P"/>From these facts Hopkins<sup>9</sup> deduces the erroneousness of the
ordinary view,<sup>10</sup> according to which Turvaśa is the name of
a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards Turvaśa
as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is
not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument
based on the theory<sup>11</sup> that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda
are the {@Anus, Druhyus,@} Turvaśas, Yadus, and {@Pūrus,@} it is
perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvaśas and Yadus were
two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently
were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the
{%Turvaśā-Yadū%} and speak of {%Yadus Turvaś ca.%} This explanation
also suits best the use of the plural of Turvaśa in two Rigvedic
hymns.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the chief exploit of Turvaśa was his partici-
pation in the war against {@Sudās,@} by whom he was defeated.<sup>12</sup>
Hopkins<sup>13</sup> suggests that he may have been named Turvaśa
because of his fleet ({%tura%}) escape from the battle. His escape
<div n="P"/>1 i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; vi. 20,
12; 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14;
45, 27; x. 49, 8. In vii. 18, 6, Turvaśa
is joined with Yakṣu, apparently a con-
temptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins,
{%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
15, 261). {%Cf.%} {@Tṛtsu.@}
[Page1-316+ 54]
may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages<sup>14</sup> Indra's
aid to Turvaśa (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant
that the Anu, and apparently the Druhyu, kings are mentioned
as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the Turvaśa
and Yadu kings, and that Turvaśa appears in the eighth book
of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince,
the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned.<sup>15</sup>
Griffith,<sup>16</sup> however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat
by Turvaśa and Yadu of Arṇa and Citraratha on the {@Sarayu;@}<sup>17</sup>
but the evidence for this is quite inadequate.
<div n="P"/>Two passages of the Rigveda<sup>18</sup> seem to refer to an attack by
Turvaśa and Yadu on {@Divodāsa,@} the father of Sudās. It is
reasonable to suppose that this was an attack of the two
peoples on Divodāsa, for there is some improbability of the
references being to the Turvaśa, who was concerned in the
attack on Sudās, the son.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>19</sup> considers that the Turvaśas were also called {@Vṛcī-@}
{@vants.@} This view is based on a hymn<sup>20</sup> in which reference
is made to the defeat of the Vṛcīvants on the {@Yavyāvatī@} and
{@Hariyūpīyā@} in aid of Daivarāta, and of Turvaśa in aid of
{@Sṛñjaya,@} the latter being elsewhere<sup>21</sup> clearly the son of Deva-
rāta. But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvaśas
with the Vṛcīvants is not clear, it seems sufficient<sup>22</sup> to assume
that they were allies.
<div n="P"/>Later, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>23</sup> the Turvaśas appear
as allies of the Pañcālas, Taurvaśa horses, thirty-three in
number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being
mentioned.<sup>24</sup> But otherwise the name disappears: this lends
[Page1-317+ 47]
probability to Oldenberge's conjecture<sup>25</sup> that the Turvaśas
became merged in the {@Pañcāla@} people. Hopkins<sup>26</sup> considers
that in the Śatapatha passage the horses were merely named
from the family of Turvaśa; but this view is less likely, since
it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the
Turvaśas at the time of their conflict with Sudās. They
apparently crossed the {@Paruṣṇī,@}<sup>27</sup> but from which side is dis-
puted. The view of Pischel<sup>28</sup> and Geldner,<sup>29</sup> that they advanced
from the west towards the east, where the {@Bharatas@} were (see
{@Kuru@}), is the more probable.
