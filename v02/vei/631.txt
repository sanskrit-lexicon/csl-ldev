<L>631<pc>1-161<k1>कुत्स<k2>कुत्स
{@Kutsa@}¦ is the name of a hero frequently mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, which, however, gives practically no information
<div n="lb"/>about him, for he was no doubt already a figure of the mythic
<div n="lb"/>past. He is several times<sup>1</sup> called Ārjuneya, ‘descendant of
<div n="lb"/>Arjuna,’ and is usually<sup>2</sup> associated with Indra in the exploit of
<div n="lb"/>defeating the demon Śuṣṇa and winning the sun. He is said<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to have defeated {@Smadibha, Tugra,@} and the {@Vetasus,@} but, on the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, he is several times<sup>4</sup> mentioned with {@Atithigva@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Āyu@} as being vanquished by Indra, his defeat in one passage<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>being attributed to {@Tūrvayāṇa.@} Elsewhere<sup>6</sup> he appears with
<div n="lb"/>Atithigva as a friend of Indra's. In the later literature he is
<div n="lb"/>seldom<sup>7</sup> mentioned except in connexion with the myth of his
<div n="lb"/>binding Indra, which is found in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>8</sup> and which is
<div n="lb"/>based on an obscure verse in the Rigveda.<sup>9</sup>
