{@Jamad-agni@}¦ is one of the somewhat mythical sages of the
Rigveda, where he is frequently mentioned. In some passages<sup>1</sup>
his name occurs in such a way as to indicate that he is the
author of the hymn; once<sup>2</sup> he is thus associated with {@Viśvā-@}
{@mitra.@} In other passages<sup>3</sup> he is merely referred to, and the
Jamadagnis are mentioned once.<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda,<sup>5</sup> as well
as the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>6</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>7</sup> he is quite a
frequent figure. Here he appears as a friend of Viśvāmitra<sup>8</sup>
and a rival of {@Vasiṣṭha.@}<sup>9</sup> He owed his prosperity to his {%catū-%}
{%rātra,%} or ‘four-night’ ritual, with which his family were also
very successful.<sup>10</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>11</sup> Jamadagni is connected
with {@Atri@} and {@Kaṇva,@} as well as {@Asita@} and {@Vitahavya.@} He was
Adhvaryu priest at the proposed sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa.@}<sup>12</sup>
