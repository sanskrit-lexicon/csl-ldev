{@Pitṛ-yāṇa,@}¦ the ‘way of the fathers,’ mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later,<sup>2</sup> is opposed to the Deva-yāna, or ‘way of the gods.’
Tilak<sup>3</sup> considers that the Devayāna corresponds with the
Uttarāyaṇa, ‘northern journey’ of the sun, and the Pitṛyāṇa
with the Dakṣiṇāyana, its ‘southern journey.’ He concludes
from a passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> where three of
the seasons — spring, summer, and the rains — are ascribed to
the gods, but the others to the Pitṛs, or Fathers, that the
Devayāna began with the vernal equinox, and the Pitṛyāṇa
with the autumnal equinox. With this he connects the curious
[Page1-530+ 37]
distinction of Deva- and Yama-Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup> These conclusions are, however, very improbable.
