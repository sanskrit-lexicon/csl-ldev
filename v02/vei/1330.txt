{@Dur-gaha@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
his grandsons are lauded for their generosity, though Sāyaṇa
renders the word adjectivally.<sup>2</sup> In another passage of the
Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> however, Sāyaṇa sees in the epithet Daurgaha a
description of {@Purukutsa@} as Durgaha's son, who was either
captured by the enemy or slain, and whose wife, {@Purukutsānī,@}
then obtained a son, {@Trasadasyu,@} to restore the line; he also
quotes a story, not found in the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> to support this
interpretation. On the other hand, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup>
seems to take Daurgaha as meaning a horse. Sieg<sup>6</sup> thinks
that the same sense should be adopted in the Rigveda passage,
which he interprets as referring to the sacrifice of a horse,
Daurgaha, by King Purukutsa to gain a son; he also sees in
Dadhikrāvan, with Pischel<sup>7</sup> and Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> a real horse, the
charger of Trasadasyu. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa's inter-
pretation of Daurgaha is, however, doubtful, and cannot be
regarded as receiving support from the case of Dadhikrāvan,
who was probably a divinity, and not a real horse at all.<sup>9</sup>
