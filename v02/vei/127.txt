{@A-rājānaḥ,@}¦ ‘not princes,’ is a term used to describe persons
in two passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> and in the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> Weber<sup>3</sup> also finds them mentioned in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>4</sup> and thinks that they — {@Sūtas@} (‘charioteers’) and
{@Grāmaṇīs@} (‘troop-leaders’) there referred to — were called thus
because, while not themselves princes, they assisted in the con-
secration of princes.
