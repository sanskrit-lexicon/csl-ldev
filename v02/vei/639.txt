{@Kumbyā@}¦ or {@Kumvyā@} is a word mentioned after Ṛc, Yajus,
Sāman, and Gāthā in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> to denote
a form of speech. In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>2</sup> it appears as
one of the forms of measured speech together with Ṛc and
Gāthā. The precise meaning of the term is unknown. Weber<sup>3</sup>
suggests the sense ‘refrain.’
