{@Pūru@}¦ is the name of a people and their king in the Rigveda.
<div n="lb"/>They are mentioned with the {@Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas,@}
<div n="lb"/>and {@Yadus@} in one passage.<sup>1</sup> They also occur as enemies of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Tṛtsus@} in the hymn of {@Sudās’@} victory.<sup>2</sup> In another
[Page2-012+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>hymn<sup>3</sup> Agni of the {@Bharatas@} is celebrated as victorious over the
<div n="lb"/>Pūrus, probably a reference to the same decisive overthrow.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, victories of the Pūrus over the aborigines
<div n="lb"/>seem to be referred to in several passages.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The great kings of the Pūrus were {@Purukutsa@} and his son
<div n="lb"/>{@Trasadasyu,@} whose name bears testimony to his prowess
<div n="lb"/>against aboriginal foes, while a later prince was {@Tṛkṣi Trāsa-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@dasyava.@}
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Pūrus are expressly<sup>5</sup> mentioned as on
<div n="lb"/>the {@Sarasvatī.@} Zimmer<sup>6</sup> thinks that the {@Sindhu@} (Indus) is
<div n="lb"/>meant in this passage. But Ludwig<sup>7</sup> and Hillebrandt<sup>8</sup> with
<div n="lb"/>much greater probability think that the eastern Sarasvatī in
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra is meant. This view accords well with the sudden
<div n="lb"/>disappearance of the name of the Pūrus from Vedic tradition,
<div n="lb"/>a disappearance accounted for by Oldenberg's<sup>9</sup> conjecture that
<div n="lb"/>the Pūrus became part of the great Kuru people, just as
<div n="lb"/>{@Turvaśa@} and {@Krivi@} disappear from the tradition on their being
<div n="lb"/>merged in the {@Pañcāla@} nation. Trāsadasyava, the patronymic
<div n="lb"/>of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} in the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> shows that the royal
<div n="lb"/>families of the Kurus and the Pūrus were allied by inter-
<div n="lb"/>marriage.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>11</sup> admitting that the Pūrus in later times lived
<div n="lb"/>in the eastern country round the Sarasvatī, thinks that in
<div n="lb"/>earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus
<div n="lb"/>with {@Divodāsa.@} This theory must fall with the theory that
<div n="lb"/>Divodāsa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to
<div n="lb"/>be supported by the fact that Alexander found a <lang n="greek">Πῶρος</lang> — that
<div n="lb"/>is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes,<sup>12</sup> a sort of half-way
<div n="lb"/>locality between the Sarasvatī and the West. But it is quite
<div n="lb"/>simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier
<div n="lb"/>home of the Pūrus, where some remained after the others had
[Page2-013+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a success-
<div n="lb"/>ful onslaught upon the west from the east.
<div n="P"/>In several other passages of the Rigveda<sup>13</sup> the Pūrus as a
<div n="lb"/>people seem to be meant. The Nirukta<sup>14</sup> recognizes the general
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or
<div n="lb"/>even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> explains Pūru in the Rigveda<sup>16</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>an Asura Rakṣas; it is only in the Epic that Pūru revives as
<div n="lb"/>the name of a son of Yayāti and Śarmiṣṭhā.<sup>17</sup>

<div n="lb"/>parently, as Hopkins, {%Journal of the%}
<div n="lb"/>{%American Oriental Society,%} 15, 263, n.,
<div n="lb"/>and Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 135,
<div n="lb"/>think, in this verse the words {%jeṣma%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Pūruṃ vidathe mṛdhravācam%} refer to the
<div n="lb"/>Pūru king and to the priest {@Viśvāmitra,@}
<div n="lb"/>who prayed for the defeat of Sudās,
<div n="lb"/>though in vain. Hopkins seems to take
<div n="lb"/>the words {%vidathe mṛdhravācam%} generally
<div n="lb"/>as ‘the false speaker in the assembly’;
<div n="lb"/>but, according to Geldner, the meaning
<div n="lb"/>intended is that, while the king fought,
<div n="lb"/>the Purohita prayed in the Sabhā, or
<div n="lb"/>meeting house of the people.</F>
