{@Pūru@}¦ is the name of a people and their king in the Rigveda.
They are mentioned with the {@Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas,@}
and {@Yadus@} in one passage.<sup>1</sup> They also occur as enemies of
the {@Tṛtsus@} in the hymn of {@Sudās’@} victory.<sup>2</sup> In another
[Page2-012+ 48]
hymn<sup>3</sup> Agni of the {@Bharatas@} is celebrated as victorious over the
Pūrus, probably a reference to the same decisive overthrow.
On the other hand, victories of the Pūrus over the aborigines
seem to be referred to in several passages.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The great kings of the Pūrus were {@Purukutsa@} and his son
{@Trasadasyu,@} whose name bears testimony to his prowess
against aboriginal foes, while a later prince was {@Tṛkṣi Trāsa-@}
{@dasyava.@}
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Pūrus are expressly<sup>5</sup> mentioned as on
the {@Sarasvatī.@} Zimmer<sup>6</sup> thinks that the {@Sindhu@} (Indus) is
meant in this passage. But Ludwig<sup>7</sup> and Hillebrandt<sup>8</sup> with
much greater probability think that the eastern Sarasvatī in
Kurukṣetra is meant. This view accords well with the sudden
disappearance of the name of the Pūrus from Vedic tradition,
a disappearance accounted for by Oldenberg's<sup>9</sup> conjecture that
the Pūrus became part of the great Kuru people, just as
{@Turvaśa@} and {@Krivi@} disappear from the tradition on their being
merged in the {@Pañcāla@} nation. Trāsadasyava, the patronymic
of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} in the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> shows that the royal
families of the Kurus and the Pūrus were allied by inter-
marriage.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>11</sup> admitting that the Pūrus in later times lived
in the eastern country round the Sarasvatī, thinks that in
earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus
with {@Divodāsa.@} This theory must fall with the theory that
Divodāsa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to
be supported by the fact that Alexander found a <lang n="greek">Πῶρος</lang> — that
is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes,<sup>12</sup> a sort of half-way
locality between the Sarasvatī and the West. But it is quite
simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier
home of the Pūrus, where some remained after the others had
[Page2-013+ 52]
wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a success-
ful onslaught upon the west from the east.
<div n="P"/>In several other passages of the Rigveda<sup>13</sup> the Pūrus as a
people seem to be meant. The Nirukta<sup>14</sup> recognizes the general
sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or
even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> explains Pūru in the Rigveda<sup>16</sup> as
an Asura Rakṣas; it is only in the Epic that Pūru revives as
the name of a son of Yayāti and Śarmiṣṭhā.<sup>17</sup>

parently, as Hopkins, {%Journal of the%}
{%American Oriental Society,%} 15, 263, n.,
and Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 135,
think, in this verse the words {%jeṣma%}
{%Pūruṃ vidathe mṛdhravācam%} refer to the
Pūru king and to the priest {@Viśvāmitra,@}
who prayed for the defeat of Sudās,
though in vain. Hopkins seems to take
the words {%vidathe mṛdhravācam%} generally
as ‘the false speaker in the assembly’;
but, according to Geldner, the meaning
intended is that, while the king fought,
the Purohita prayed in the Sabhā, or
meeting house of the people.</F>

in the sense. In i. 63, 7, there is a
reference to the Pūru king, Purukutsa,
and Sudās, but in what relation is
uncertain (see {@Purukutsa@}). In i. 130, 7.
the Pūru king and Divodāsa Atithigva
are both mentioned, apparently as
victorious over aboriginal foes. See
