{@Carman,@}¦ denoting ‘hide’ in general, is a common expression
from the Rigveda onwards.<sup>1</sup> The oxhide was turned to many
uses, such as the manufacture of bowstrings, slings, and reins
(see {@Go@}). It was especially often employed to place above the
boards<sup>2</sup> on which the Soma was pressed with the stones.<sup>3</sup> It
was possibly also used for making skin bags.<sup>4</sup> Carmaṇya
denotes leather-work generally in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The art of tanning hides ({%mlā%}) was known as early as the
Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> where also the word for ‘tanner’ ({%carmamna%}) occurs.<sup>7</sup>
Details of the process are lacking, but the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup>
refers to stretching out a hide with pegs ({%śañkubhiḥ%}), and the
Rigveda<sup>9</sup> mentions the wetting of the hide.
