{@Asamāti Rātha-prauṣṭha.@}¦ — The story of the quarrel between
Asamāti, the Ikṣvāku prince of the Rathaproṣṭha family, and
[Page1-047+ 52]
his priests, the Gaupāyanas, is found only in the later
Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> It appears to be based on a misreading of the
Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> where {%asamāti%} is merely an adjective. The later
story is that the king was induced to abandon his family priests
by two Asuras, Kirāta and Ākuli, who by their magic com-
passed the death of Subandhu, one of the brother priests, and
that the others revived him by the use of the hymns (Rigveda,
x. 57-60).
