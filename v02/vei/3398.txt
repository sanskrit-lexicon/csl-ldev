{@Śvaśura@}¦ from the Rigveda onwards<sup>1</sup> denotes the ‘father-in-
law’ of the wife; not till the Sūtra period does it include the
‘father-in-law’ of the husband.<sup>2</sup> The daughter-in-law ({@Snuṣā@}),
in the normal case when the father-in-law was the head of the
family to which her husband belonged in fact as well as in age,
was bound to pay him all respect.<sup>3</sup> When the old man had
ceased to exercise control, she became mistress ({%samrājñī%})
over him and his wife.<sup>4</sup> In the plural<sup>5</sup> the word denotes the
‘parents-in-law.’
