{@Jahnu@}¦ occurs only in the plural in the legend of {@Śunaḥśepa,@}
<div n="lb"/>who is said to have obtained, as Devarāta, both the lordship
<div n="lb"/>of the Jahnus and the divine lore of the Gāthins.<sup>1</sup> A {@Jāhnava,@}
<div n="lb"/>or descendant of Jahnu, was, according to the Pañcaviṃśa
[Page1-281+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> {@Viśvāmitra,@} who is said, by means of a certain
<div n="lb"/>{%catū-rātra%} or ‘four-night’ ritual, to have secured the kingdom
<div n="lb"/>for the Jahnus in their conflict with the {@Vṛcīvants.@} He is
<div n="lb"/>here described as a king. Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra is addressed as a {%rāja-putra,%} ‘prince,’ and {%Bharata-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%rṣabha,%} ‘bull of the Bharatas.’ It is therefore clear that the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas, though not the Saṃhitās, saw in him at once a
<div n="lb"/>priest and a prince by origin, though there is no trace whatever
<div n="lb"/>of their seeing in him a prince who won Brahmanhood as in
<div n="lb"/>the version of the later texts.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>A Jahnāvī is mentioned twice in the Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> being either
<div n="lb"/>the wife of Jahnu, or, as Sāyaṇa thinks, the race of Jahnu.
<div n="lb"/>The family must clearly once have been a great one, later
<div n="lb"/>merged in the Bharatas.
