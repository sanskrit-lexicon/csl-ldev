{@Nārṣada,@}¦ ‘descendant of Nṛṣad,’ is the patronymic of Kaṇva
({%i.e.,%} a descendant of Kaṇva) in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and in one
passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> where probably the same man is
referred to in another passage<sup>3</sup> as a protégé of the Aśvins, and
perhaps as the husband of {@Ruśatī.@} But in a third passage of
the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the name seems applied to a demon, though this
is not certain.
