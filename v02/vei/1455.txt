2. {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitra-vīrya@}¦ (‘descendant of Vicitra-
<div n="lb"/>vīrya’) is mentioned in a passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which is, unhappily, far from intelligible. But there is no
<div n="lb"/>ground for supposing that he was a Kuru-Pañcāla king; he
<div n="lb"/>seems rather to have lived at some distance from the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas. There is no good reason to deny his identity<sup>2</sup> with
<div n="lb"/>the Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> king of {@Kāśi,@} who
<div n="lb"/>was defeated, when he attempted to offer a horse sacrifice, by
<div n="lb"/>{@Sātrājita Śatānīka.@} The fact that the latter was a {@Bharata@}
<div n="lb"/>also points to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's not having been a Kuru-Pañcāla at
<div n="lb"/>all. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā he appears as having a dispute
<div n="lb"/>with {@Vaka Dālbhi;@} but even assuming that the latter was
<div n="lb"/>a Pañcāla, there is nothing to hint that the former was a Kuru
<div n="lb"/>or that this dispute is a sign of an early hostility of Kuru and
<div n="lb"/>Pañcāla.<sup>4</sup> It is true that in the Epic {@Śantanu@} and Vicitravīrya
<div n="lb"/>and Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself are all connected, but this connexion
<div n="lb"/>seems to be due, as so often in the Epic, to a confused derange-
<div n="lb"/>ment of great figures of the past.

<div n="lb"/>is independent of the identification of

<div n="lb"/>by it.</F>
