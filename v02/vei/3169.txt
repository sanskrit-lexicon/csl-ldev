{@Śamī@}¦ is the name of a tree in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup>
It is described in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> as destructive to the hair,<sup>4</sup> as
producing intoxication, and as broad-leaved. These charac-
teristics are totally wanting in the two trees, {%Prosopis spicigera%}
or {%Mimosa suma,%} with which the Śamī is usually identified.<sup>5</sup>
[Page2-355+ 56]
From the soft wood of the Śamī was formed the lower of the
two sticks ({%araṇī%}) used for kindling the sacred fire,<sup>6</sup> the upper
one (the drill) being of {@Aśvattha.@} The fruit of the tree is
called Śamīdhānya.<sup>7</sup>
