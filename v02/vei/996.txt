1. {@Chandas@}¦ in the Rigveda usually denotes a ‘song of
<div n="lb"/>praise’ or ‘hymn.’<sup>1</sup> The original sense of the word, as derived
<div n="lb"/>from the verb {%chand,%} ‘to please,’ was probably ‘attractive
<div n="lb"/>spell,’ ‘magic hymn,’<sup>2</sup> which prevailed on the gods. In a very
<div n="lb"/>late hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> as well as in one of the Atharvaveda,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the word is mentioned in the plural ({%chandāṃsi%}), beside Ṛc
<div n="lb"/>({%ṛcaḥ%}), Sāman ({%sāmāni%}), and Yajus, and seems to retain its
<div n="lb"/>original meaning, not improbably with reference to the magical
<div n="lb"/>subject-matter of the Atharvaveda. From denoting a (metrical)
<div n="lb"/>hymn it comes to mean ‘metre’ in a very late verse of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> in which the ‘Gāyatrī, the Triṣṭubh, and all ({%sarvā%})
<div n="lb"/>the metres ({%chandāṃsi%}) are mentioned. In the later Saṃhitās
<div n="lb"/>three<sup>6</sup> or seven<sup>7</sup> metres are enumerated, and in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> eight. By the time of the Rigveda Prātiśākhya<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the metres were subjected to a detailed examination, though
<div n="lb"/>much earlier references are found to the number of syllables in
<div n="lb"/>the several metres.<sup>10</sup> Later the word definitely denotes a Vedic
<div n="lb"/>text generally, as in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>11</sup>
