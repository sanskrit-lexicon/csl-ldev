{@Madhu-kaśā,@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Madhoḥ Kasā,@}<sup>2</sup> is the name in the Rigveda
of the Aśvins’ ‘honey-whip,’ by which they impart sweetness to
the sacrifice. Roth<sup>3</sup> ingeniously conjectures that the idea was
derived from an instrument provided with thongs for whipping
milk, a ‘milk-whip.’
