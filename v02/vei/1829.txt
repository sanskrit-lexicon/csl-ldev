{@Pippala,@}¦ n., is found in two passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> meaning
‘berry,’ used with a mystic signification, and in neither case
with any certain reference to the berry of the fig-tree.<sup>2</sup> In the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> the general sense of ‘berry’ is not
necessary, and the special sense of ‘berry’ of the Peepal is
quite possible: the latter meaning is perhaps intended in the
Satapatha Brāhmana.<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> the feminine
form of the word, Pippalī, appears denoting berries used as a
remedy for wounds, like {@Arundhatī.@}<sup>6</sup>
