{@Paṇi@}¦ in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is
<div n="lb"/>rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow
<div n="lb"/>{@Dakṣiṇās@} on the priests, and who is therefore an object of
<div n="lb"/>intense dislike to the composers of the Saṃhitā.<sup>1</sup> Hence the
<div n="lb"/>gods are asked to attack the Paṇis, who are also referred to
<div n="lb"/>as being defeated with slaughter.<sup>2</sup> The Paṇi is opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>pious sacrificer as a niggard,<sup>3</sup> and is spoken of as a wolf,<sup>4</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>symbol of enmity. In some passages<sup>5</sup> the Paṇis definitely
<div n="lb"/>appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows
<div n="lb"/>or waters of heaven, and to whom Saramā goes on a mission
<div n="lb"/>from Indra.<sup>6</sup> Among the Paṇis {@Bṛbu@} was apparently important.
<div n="lb"/>In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> they are described as {@Beka-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@nāṭas,@} or ‘usurers’ (?). In another<sup>8</sup> they are called {@Dasyus,@}
<div n="lb"/>and styled {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and {%grathin,%}
<div n="lb"/>a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> thinks that the
<div n="lb"/>latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which
[Page1-472+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>is not understood, and that {%mṛdhra-vāc%} means ‘śpeaking an
<div n="lb"/>enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to
<div n="lb"/>non-Āryans.<sup>10</sup> In two passages<sup>11</sup> the Paṇis appear as {@Dāsas,@}
<div n="lb"/>and in one<sup>12</sup> a Paṇi is mentioned in connexion with wer-
<div n="lb"/>geld ({@Vaira@}), being apparently regarded as equal to a man
<div n="lb"/>merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as
<div n="lb"/>inferior.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to be certain exactly who a Paṇi was. Roth<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the word is derived from {%paṇ,%} ‘barter,’ and that
<div n="lb"/>the Paṇi is properly the man who will give nothing without
<div n="lb"/>return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor
<div n="lb"/>rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>14</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>by Ludwig.<sup>15</sup> The latter scholar thinks the apparent references
<div n="lb"/>to fights with Paṇis are to be explained by their having been
<div n="lb"/>aboriginal traders who went in caravans — as in Arabia and
<div n="lb"/>Northern Africa — prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their
<div n="lb"/>goods against attacks which the Āryans would naturally deem
<div n="lb"/>quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references
<div n="lb"/>to the Paṇis as Dasyus and Dāsas. It is, however, hardly
<div n="lb"/>necessary to do more than regard the Paṇis generally as
<div n="lb"/>non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term
<div n="lb"/>is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile Āryan
<div n="lb"/>tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt,<sup>16</sup> however, thinks that
<div n="lb"/>a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they
<div n="lb"/>were associated with the Dahae ({@Dāsa@}). Moreover, he finds
<div n="lb"/>them associated in one passage<sup>17</sup> with the {@Pārāvatas,@} whom
[Page1-473+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>he identifies with the <lang n="greek">Παρουῆται</lang> of Ptolemy,<sup>18</sup> and with {@Bṛṣaya,@}
<div n="lb"/>whom he connects with <lang n="greek">Βαρσαέντης</lang> of Arrian;<sup>19</sup> he also con-
<div n="lb"/>siders that the frequent<sup>20</sup> mention of the Paṇis as opponents
<div n="lb"/>of {@Divodāsa@} shows that the latter was on the Arachosian
<div n="lb"/>Haraqaiti ({@Sarasvatī@}) fighting against the Parnians and Dahae,
<div n="lb"/>as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of Paṇi
<div n="lb"/>and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root {%paṇ,%} which
<div n="lb"/>is found also in the Greek <lang n="greek">πέρνημι</lang>, shows a satisfactory deri-
<div n="lb"/>vation, while the transfer of Divodāsa to the Haraqaiti is
<div n="lb"/>improbable. See also {@Divodāsa@} and {@Bekanāṭa.@}
