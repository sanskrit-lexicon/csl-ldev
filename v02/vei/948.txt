{@Cakra,@}¦ the ‘wheel’ of a chariot or wagon, is repeatedly
mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, often in a metaphorical
sense. The wheel was fixed on the axle ({@Akṣa@}) when the
chariot was required for use; this required considerable
strength, as is shown by a reference in the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The
wheel consisted normally of spokes ({@Ara@}), and a nave ({@Nābhi@}),<sup>3</sup>
in the opening ({@Kha@}) of which the end of the axle ({@Āṇi@}) was
inserted. An indication of the importance attached to the
strength of the wheel is the celebration of the car of the god
Pūṣan as having a wheel that suffers no damage.<sup>4</sup> The usual
number of wheels was two,<sup>5</sup> but in seven passages of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
a chariot is called ‘three-wheeled,’ in a few others ‘seven-
wheeled,’<sup>7</sup> while in one of the Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> it is styled ‘eight-
wheeled.’ Zimmer<sup>9</sup> argues that these epithets do not refer to
real chariots, pointing out that in all the passages where
{%tri-cakra,%} ‘three-wheeled,’ occurs there is a mythical reference.
On the other hand, Weber<sup>10</sup> thinks that there might have been
chariots with three wheels, one being in the centre between the
two occupants. This is not very conclusive; at any rate, the
seven-wheeled and the eight-wheeled chariots can hardly be
regarded as indicating the existence of real vehicles with that
number of wheels.

{%cakra%}) is referred to.
