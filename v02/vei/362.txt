{@Upa-dhi@}¦ occurs once each in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Athar-
vaveda,<sup>2</sup> in conjunction with {@Pradhi,@} denoting part of the
wheel of a chariot. It is impossible to decide exactly what
part is meant. Roth,<sup>3</sup> Zimmer<sup>4</sup> and Bloomfield,<sup>5</sup> agree in
thinking that the word denotes the spokes collectively.
Whitney,<sup>6</sup> considering this improbable, prefers to see in it the
designation of a solid wheel, Pradhi being presumably the rim
and Upadhi the rest. Other possibilities<sup>7</sup> are that the Upadhi
is a rim beneath the felly, or the felly itself as compared with
the tire (ordinarily {@Pavi@}).
