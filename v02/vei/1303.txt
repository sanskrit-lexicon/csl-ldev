{@Dāśa-rājña@}¦ is the name in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Athar-
vaveda<sup>2</sup> of {@Sudās'@} famous ‘battle with the ten kings.’ It is
somewhat difficult to make out exactly who the kings were
(see {@Turvaśa@}), but the number is probably a round one, and
cannot be pressed. The actual battle hymn<sup>3</sup> does not contain
[Page1-356+ 62]
the word, and the passages in which it is found may reasonably
be considered late.<sup>4</sup>
