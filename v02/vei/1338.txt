{@Duḥ-śāsu@}¦ is possibly a proper name in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>would then denote an enemy of {@Kuruśravaṇa.@} Ludwig<sup>2</sup> thinks
<div n="lb"/>that he was a {@Parśu@} or Persian, but this is most improbable,
<div n="lb"/>and the word may simply be an adjective meaning ‘malignant.’
