{@Ratha@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes ‘chariot’ as
opposed to {@Anas,@} ‘cart,’ though the distinction is not absolute.
Of differences in the structure of the two we have no informa-
tion, except that the {@Kha,@} or nave hole, in the wheel of the
chariot was greater than in that of the cart.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels ({@Cakra@}), to which
reference is frequently made.<sup>4</sup> The wheel consisted of a rim
({@Pavi@}), a felly ({@Pradhi@}), spokes ({@Ara@}),<sup>5</sup> and a nave ({@Nabhya@}).
The rim and the felly together constitute the {@Nemi.@} The hole
in the nave is called {@Kha:@} into it the end of the axle was
inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether {@Āṇi@} denotes
the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the
lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes
a solid wheel was used.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>The axle ({@Akṣa@}) was, in some cases, made of {@Araṭu@} wood;<sup>7</sup>
round its ends the wheels revolved. To the axle was attached
the body of the chariot ({@Kośa@}). This part is also denoted by
the word {@Vandhura,@} which more precisely means the ‘seat’
of the chariot. The epithet {%tri-vandhura%} is used of the chariot
of the Aśvins, seemingly to correspond with another of its
epithets, {%tri-cakra:%} perhaps, as Weber<sup>8</sup> thinks, a chariot with
three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but
Zimmer<sup>9</sup> considers that the vehicle was purely mythical. {@Garta@}
also denotes the seat of the warrior.
[Page2-202+ 61]
<div n="P"/>At right angles to the axle was the pole of the chariot ({@Īṣā,@}
{@Praüga@}). Normally there was, it seems, one pole, on either
side of which the horses were harnessed, a yoke ({@Yuga@}) being
laid across their necks; the pole was passed through the hole
in the yoke (called Kha<sup>10</sup> or Tardman),<sup>11</sup> the yoke and the pole
then being tied together.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The horses were tied by the neck ({%grīvā%}), where the yoke was
placed, and also at the shoulder, presumably by traces fastened
to a bar of wood at right angles to the pole, or fastened to the
ends of the pole, if that is to be regarded, as it probably
should, as of triangular shape, wide at the foot and coming to
a point at the tip.<sup>13</sup> The traces seem to be denoted by {@Raśmi@}
and {@Raśanā.@} These words also denote the ‘reins,’ which were
fastened to the bit (perhaps {%śiprā%}) in the horse's mouth. The
driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with
a whip ({%Kaśā%}).<sup>14</sup> The girths of the horse were called Kakṣyā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but
three or four<sup>16</sup> were often used. It is uncertain whether, in
these cases, the extra horse was attached in front or at the
side; possibly both modes were in use. Even five steeds could
be employed.<sup>17</sup> Horses were normally used for chariots, but
the ass ({%gardabha%})<sup>18</sup> or mule ({%aśvatarī%})<sup>19</sup> are also mentioned.
The ox was employed for drawing carts, and in fact derived its
[Page2-203+ 57]
name, {@Anaḍvāh,@} from this use. Sometimes a poor man had to
be content with a single steed, which then ran between two
shafts.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the chariot the driver stood on the right, while the
warrior was on the left, as indicated by his name, {@Savyeṣṭha@} or
{@Savyaṣṭhā,@}<sup>21</sup> He could also sit when he wanted, for the
chariot had seats, and an archer would naturally prefer to sit
while shooting his arrows.
<div n="P"/>The dimensions of the chariot are given in the Śulba Sūtra<sup>22</sup>
of Āpastamba at 188 Aṅgulis (finger-breadths) for the pole,
104 for the axle, and 86 for the yoke. The material used in
its construction was wood, except for the rim of the wheel.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Many other parts of the chariot are mentioned, their names
being often obscure in meaning: see {@Aṅka, Nyaṅka, Uddhi,@}

with Savyaṣṭhā, and in the Taittirīya

occurs as a compound where the sense
is certainly ‘the warrior and the
charioteer.’ See also Śatapatha Brāh-
