{@Sarpis@}¦ denotes ‘melted butter,’ whether in a liquid or
solidified condition, and not differing from {@Ghṛta@} according to
the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Roth there rejects the defini-
tion cited by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Aitareya Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>1</sup> which discriminates Sarpis as the liquid and Ghṛta as
the solid condition of the butter. The word is repeatedly
mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> and later.<sup>3</sup>
