2. {@Kṛṣṇa@}¦ appears as the name of a seer in one hymn of the
Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> Tradition assigns to him or to Viśvaka, son of
Kṛṣṇa ({%Kārṣṇi%}), the authorship of the following hymn.<sup>2</sup> The
word Kṛṣṇiya may be a patronymic<sup>3</sup> formed from the same
name in two other hymns of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> where the Aśvins
are said to have restored {@Viṣṇāpū@} to Viśvaka Kṛṣṇya. In that
case Kṛṣṇa would seem to be the grandfather of Viṣṇāpū. This
Kṛṣṇa may be identical with Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa mentioned in the
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup>
