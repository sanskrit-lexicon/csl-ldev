1. {@Veśa@}¦ is a term of somewhat doubtful sense, apparently
denoting ‘vassal,’ ‘tenant,’ in a few passages,<sup>1</sup> and, according
to Roth,<sup>2</sup> ‘dependent neighbour.’

ii. 3, 7; iv. 1, 13. {%Cf.%} Weber, {%Indische%}
{%Studien,%} 13, 204, who takes {%veśas%} in Av.
ii. 32, 5, where {%pari-veśas%} also occurs in
the same sense, and compares {%vaiśya%}
in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 7, 1, as
meaning ‘servitude’</F>
<F>2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.%} 1,
{%veśa,%} and {%veśatva. Cf.%} Whitney, Trans-
lation of the Atharvaveda, 75, who
seems inclined to read {%veṣas%} in Av.
ii. 32, 5; but Weber's explanation of
the origin of the sense of ‘servant’ is
adequate. Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 3,
135, n. 4, sees in Veśa either a neigh-
bour or a member of the same village
community. {%Cf.%} {@Sajāta.@}</F>
