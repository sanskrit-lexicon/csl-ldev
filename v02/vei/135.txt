1. {@Arundhatī@}¦ is the name of a plant celebrated in several
passages of the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as possessing healing properties in
case of wounds, as a febrifuge, and as inducing cows to give
milk. The plant was a climber which attached itself to trees
like the {@Plakṣa, Aśvattha, Nyagrodha,@} and {@Parṇa.@}<sup>2</sup> It was
of golden colour ({%hiraṇya-varṇā%}), and had a hairy stem ({%lomaśa-%}
{%vakṣaṇā%}).<sup>3</sup> It was also called Silācī, and the {@Lākṣā@} appears to
have been a product of it.<sup>4</sup>
