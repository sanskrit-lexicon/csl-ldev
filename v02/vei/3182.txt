1. {@Śarabha@}¦ is the name of some wild animal in the Atharva-
veda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> In the {@classical@} literature it is a fabulous,
eight-legged beast, dwelling in the snowy mountains, a foe of
lions and elephants: the commentator Mahīdhara sees this
sense, but without reason, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The
[Page2-358+ 41]
animal is spoken of as akin to the goat;<sup>3</sup> it was probably a
kind of deer.
