{@Vṛcīvant@}¦ is the name of a tribe referred to once in the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it is clearly stated that the {@Sṛñjaya@} king,
{@Daivavāta,@} conquered the {@Turvaśa@} king and the Vṛcīvants.
Zimmer<sup>2</sup> thinks that the Vṛcīvants and the Turvaśa people
should be identified, but this is both unnecessary and improb-
able; it is adequate to assume that they were allied against<sup>3</sup>
the Sṛñjayas. The Vṛcīvants appear again only in the strange
legend in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> according to which the
{@Jahnus@} and the Vṛcīvants contended for sovereignty, {@Viśvā-@}
{@mitra,@} the Jahnu king, winning it by his knowledge of a
certain rite. See also {@Hariyūpīyā.@}
