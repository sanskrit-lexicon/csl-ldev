{@Andhra@}¦ is the name of a people, and is mentioned with the
{@Puṇḍras, Śabaras, Pulindas,@} and {@Mūtibas,@} as being the outcasts
resulting from the refusal of the fifty eldest sons of {@Viśvāmitra@}
to accept his adoption of {@Śunaḥśepa.@}<sup>1</sup> It may fairly be deduced
[Page1-024+ 48]
from this statement that these people were recognized as non-
Aryan, as the Andhras certainly seem to have been.<sup>2</sup>

āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 26, where
instead of {%udāntyaḥ%} (‘beyond the
borders’) the reading is {%udañcaḥ%} (‘nor-
thern’), but the former is obviously
correct. The Sāṅkhāyana omits the
Pulindas, and has Mūcīpas.</F>
