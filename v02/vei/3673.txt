{@Soma@}¦ was the famous plant which was used for the prepara-
tion of the libation of Soma made at the Vedic sacrifice. Its
importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of
the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other
Maṇḍalas, are devoted to its praise.
<div n="P"/>Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs
or shoots are described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>1</sup> ruddy ({%aruṇa%}),<sup>2</sup> of
tawny ({%hari%}).<sup>3</sup> Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet
{@Naicāśākha@}<sup>4</sup> refers to the plant as Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> thinks. The
shoot is called {%aṃśu,%}<sup>6</sup> while the plant as a whole is called
{%andhas,%}<sup>7</sup> which also denotes the juice.<sup>8</sup> {%Parvan%}<sup>9</sup> is the stem.
{%Kṣip,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘finger,’ is used as a designation of the shoots, which may
therefore have resembled fingers in shape; {%vakṣaṇā%}<sup>11</sup> and {%vāṇa%}<sup>12</sup>
also seem to have the sense of the shoot. There is some slight.
evidence to suggest that the stem was not round, but angular.<sup>13</sup>
[Page2-475+ 61]
The plant grew on the mountains,<sup>14</sup> that of {@Müjavant@} being
specially renowned.
<div n="P"/>These notices are inadequate to identify the plant. It has
been held<sup>15</sup> to be the {%Sarcostemma viminale%} or the {%Asclepias acida%}
{%(= Sarcostemma brevistigma).%} Roth<sup>16</sup> held that the {%Sarcostemma%}
{%acidum%} more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt<sup>17</sup>
suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice<sup>18</sup>
thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Müller and
Rājendralāla Mitra suggested that the juice was used as an
ingredient in a kind of beer — {%i.e.,%} that the Soma plant was a
species of hop. Hillebrandt<sup>19</sup> considers that neither hops nor
the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very
probable that the plant cannot now be identified.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Yajurveda<sup>21</sup> the plant is purchased ere it is pressed.
Hillebrandt<sup>22</sup> considers that the sale must be assumed for the
Rigveda. It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained
by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince
owned it, like the {@Kīkaṭas.@}<sup>23</sup> As it stands, the ritual perform-
ance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas
(represented by a Śūdra), a ritual imitation of the action which
may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing
to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great
[Page2-476+ 61]
distance, several substitutes were allowed in the Brāhmaṇa
period.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones
or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of pro-
cedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one. The stones
are called {%grāvan%}<sup>25</sup> or {%adri,%}<sup>26</sup> and were, of course, held in the
hands.<sup>27</sup> The plant was laid on boards one beside the other
({@Adhiṣavana@}), and, according at least to the later ritual,<sup>28</sup> a
hole was dug below, so that the pounding of the plant by
means of the stones resulted in a loud noise, doubtless a
prophylactic against demoniac influences.
<div n="P"/>The plant was placed on a skin and on the Vedi<sup>29</sup> — which
was no longer done in the later ritual — {@Dhiṣaṇā@} in some
passages denoting the Vedi.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sometimes the mortar and pestle were used in place of the
stones.<sup>31</sup> This use, though Iranian, was apparently not common
in Vedic times.
