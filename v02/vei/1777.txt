{@Pāman@}¦ occurs in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as the name of a skin
disease. The derivative adjective, Pāmana, ‘suffering from
skin disease,’ is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup>
Since it is mentioned as an accompaniment of fever, probably
a cutaneous eruption or scab consequent on fever is meant.
