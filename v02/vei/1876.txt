{@Puruṣa Mṛga@}¦ the ‘man wild beast,’ occurs in the list of
victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>1</sup>
Zimmer's<sup>2</sup> view that the ape is meant seems probable.
According to him also, the word Puruṣa alone, in two passages
of the Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup> refers to the ape and its cry ({%māyu%}); but
this sense is not necessary, and it is not adopted by Bloomfield,<sup>4</sup>
though Whitney<sup>5</sup> does not think the rendering ‘cry of a man’
satisfactory, the term {%māyu%} not being properly applicable to
the noise made by human beings.
