{@Ninditāśva@}¦ (‘possessing contemptible steeds’) is the name of
a patron in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> The name may suggest connexion
with Iran, but such a reference is not at all necessary.<sup>2</sup>
Sāyaṇa ingeniously turns the name — probably a nickname — 
into a compliment by rendering it ‘one who puts to shame the
horses of his rivals.’
