{@Paulkasa@}¦ is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣa-
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>1</sup> The name also
occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> as that of a despised
race of men, together with the Cāṇḍāla. The Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> has the variant Puklaka or Pulkaka, clearly the same
as Pulkasa, of which Paulkasa is a derivative form, showing
that a caste is meant ({%cf.%} {@Kaulāla, Pauñjiṣṭha@}). In the accepted
theory<sup>4</sup> the Pulkasa is the son of a Niṣāda or Śūdra by a
Kṣatriya woman, but this is merely speculative; the Paulkasa
may either have been a functional caste, or, as Fick<sup>5</sup> believes,
an aboriginal clan living by catching wild beasts, and only
occasionally reduced to menial tasks.
