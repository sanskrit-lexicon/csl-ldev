{@Kamboja. — Yāska,@}¦ in the Nirukta,<sup>1</sup> refers to the speech of
the Kambojas as differing from that of the other Āryas. The
Kambojas were later settled to the north-west of the Indus, and
are known as Kambujiya in the old Persian inscriptions. A
teacher, {@Kāmboja Aupamanyava,@} pupil of {@Madragāra,@} is
mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> This points to a possible
connexion of the Madras, or more probably the {@Uttara Madras,@}
with the Kambojas, who probably had Iranian as well as Indian
affinities.
