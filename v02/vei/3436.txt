{@Sa-jāta@}¦ (‘born together’) is found once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and
very often later.<sup>2</sup> The word must clearly mean a ‘relative,’ and
then more widely a man of the same position or rank, but the
senses cannot be distinguished, so much do they merge into
each other. The Sajātas of a king are of course princes;<sup>3</sup> of an
[Page2-419+ 42]
ordinary man, Vaiśyas;<sup>4</sup> of a military man, Kṣatriyas. But
there is no clear reference to caste as in the later Sajāti<sup>5</sup> (‘man
of the same caste’). The disputes of Sajātas were notorious.<sup>6</sup>
