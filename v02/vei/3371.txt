{@Śramaṇa@}¦ ‘mendicant monk,’ is first found in the Upaniṣads.<sup>1</sup>
According to Fick,<sup>2</sup> anyone could become a Śramaṇa. For the
time of Megasthenes this seems indicated by his evidence,
which, however, refers only to the east of India, beyond the
{@Madhyadeśa@} proper.<sup>3</sup> The Vedic evidence is merely the name
and the fact that {@Tāpasa,@} ‘ascetic,’ follows it in the Bṛhad-
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
