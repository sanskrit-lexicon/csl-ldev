{@Śata-pati@}¦ occurs in a verse of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> as an epithet of Indra, who is
<div n="lb"/>described as alone the ‘lord of a hundred’ among men. To
<div n="lb"/>interpret the expression as ‘lord of a hundred gods,’ as does
<div n="lb"/>the commentary on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, is obviously
<div n="lb"/>impossible. It seems clear that there is a reference to an
<div n="lb"/>analogous human functionary — viz., the lord of a hundred
<div n="lb"/>villages, known in the later law<sup>3</sup> — who was probably at once a
<div n="lb"/>judicial deputy of the sovereign and a revenue collector, an
<div n="lb"/>ancient magistrate and collector.
