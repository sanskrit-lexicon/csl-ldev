{@Tri-yuga,@}¦ neut., is an expression occurring in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
where it is said that the plants ({%oṣadhi%}) were born ‘three ages’
before the gods ({%devebhyas triyugaṃ purā%}). The commentator
on the Nirukta<sup>2</sup> thinks that the ages here meant are the Yugas
of the later Indian chronology, the sense of the passage being
that the plants were born in the first Yuga. The author of
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> understands three seasons — spring,
the rains, and autumn — to be meant in the verse, taking the
two words {%triyugaṃ purā%} separately as ‘formerly, in the three
seasons.’ The vague sense ‘three ages’ is quite adequate:
the use of ‘three’ in such cases is a favourite feature in
folklore. {%Cf.%} {@Yuga.@}
