{@Tri-yuga,@}¦ neut., is an expression occurring in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where it is said that the plants ({%oṣadhi%}) were born ‘three ages’
<div n="lb"/>before the gods ({%devebhyas triyugaṃ purā%}). The commentator
<div n="lb"/>on the Nirukta<sup>2</sup> thinks that the ages here meant are the Yugas
<div n="lb"/>of the later Indian chronology, the sense of the passage being
<div n="lb"/>that the plants were born in the first Yuga. The author of
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> understands three seasons — spring,
<div n="lb"/>the rains, and autumn — to be meant in the verse, taking the
<div n="lb"/>two words {%triyugaṃ purā%} separately as ‘formerly, in the three
<div n="lb"/>seasons.’ The vague sense ‘three ages’ is quite adequate:
<div n="lb"/>the use of ‘three’ in such cases is a favourite feature in
<div n="lb"/>folklore. {%Cf.%} {@Yuga.@}
