{@Svasṛ@}¦ is the regular word from the Rigveda onwards<sup>1</sup> for
<div n="lb"/>‘sister.’ Like the word {@Bhrātṛ,@} the term sister can be applied
[Page2-496+ 42]
<div n="lb"/>to things not precisely so related. For example, in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>the fingers and the seasons are ‘sisters,’ and night is the sister
<div n="lb"/>of dawn, for whom, as the elder, she makes way.<sup>2</sup> The {@Paṇis@}
<div n="lb"/>offer to adopt Saramā as their sister;<sup>3</sup> but this use is not
<div n="lb"/>applied — any more than in the case of Bhrātṛ — to ordinary
<div n="lb"/>human beings.
<div n="P"/>The sister stood in a close relation to her brother. If the
<div n="lb"/>father was dead or feeble, the sister was dependent on her
<div n="lb"/>brother and on his wife, as appears from the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup> Moreover, maidens without brothers
<div n="lb"/>were apt to find marriage difficult, and to degenerate into
<div n="lb"/>Hetairai;<sup>6</sup> but it is not certain whether this was due, as
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>7</sup> thinks, to brothers being required to arrange
<div n="lb"/>marriages for orphan girls, or because sonless fathers were
<div n="lb"/>anxious to make their daughters {@Putrikās,@} in order that they
<div n="lb"/>themselves, instead of the husbands, should count the daughters'
<div n="lb"/>sons as their own.<sup>8</sup> See also {@Jāmi.@}
