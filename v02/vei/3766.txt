{@Svasṛ@}¦ is the regular word from the Rigveda onwards<sup>1</sup> for
‘sister.’ Like the word {@Bhrātṛ,@} the term sister can be applied
[Page2-496+ 42]
to things not precisely so related. For example, in the Rigveda
the fingers and the seasons are ‘sisters,’ and night is the sister
of dawn, for whom, as the elder, she makes way.<sup>2</sup> The {@Paṇis@}
offer to adopt Saramā as their sister;<sup>3</sup> but this use is not
applied — any more than in the case of Bhrātṛ — to ordinary
human beings.
<div n="P"/>The sister stood in a close relation to her brother. If the
father was dead or feeble, the sister was dependent on her
brother and on his wife, as appears from the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> and the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup> Moreover, maidens without brothers
were apt to find marriage difficult, and to degenerate into
Hetairai;<sup>6</sup> but it is not certain whether this was due, as
Zimmer<sup>7</sup> thinks, to brothers being required to arrange
marriages for orphan girls, or because sonless fathers were
anxious to make their daughters {@Putrikās,@} in order that they
themselves, instead of the husbands, should count the daughters'
sons as their own.<sup>8</sup> See also {@Jāmi.@}
