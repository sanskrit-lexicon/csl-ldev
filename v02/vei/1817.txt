{@Pitā-maha,@}¦ beside {@Tatāmaha,@} denotes from the Atharvaveda
<div n="lb"/>onwards<sup>1</sup> the ‘paternal grandfather,’ apparently as a ‘father in
<div n="lb"/>a higher sense.’<sup>2</sup> The great-grandfather is {@Prapitāmaha@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Pratatāmaha.@}<sup>3</sup> It is significant that there are no corrésponding
<div n="lb"/>Vedic words for maternal grandparents, and that the words
<div n="lb"/>used in the latter language, such as Mātāmaha, are imitations
<div n="lb"/>of the terms for paternal relations.
<div n="P"/>In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> Delbrück<sup>5</sup> suggests that
<div n="lb"/>{%mahe pitre%} means ‘grandfather,’ a sense which would well suit
<div n="lb"/>the {%napātam,%} ‘grandson,’ following, but the sense of the whole
<div n="lb"/>passage is uncertain.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>We learn very little from the texts of the position of grand-
<div n="lb"/>parents. No doubt they were entitled to marks of respect
<div n="lb"/>similar to those shown to parents,<sup>7</sup> as the epic expressly
<div n="lb"/>testifies. A grandfather might easily be the head of the family,
<div n="lb"/>or be living with his eldest son, after he ceased to be able to
<div n="lb"/>control the family.
<div n="P"/>The grandmother (Pitāmahī) is not mentioned in the extant
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature.
