{@Vaiśanta@}¦ is the name in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> of a prince whose
offering Indra is said to have deserted for that of {@Sudās@} through
the aid of the {@Vasiṣṭhas.@} Ludwig<sup>2</sup> thinks that the name is
Veśanta, and that he was a priest of the {@Pṛthu-Parśus;@}
Griffith<sup>3</sup> says that probably a river is meant, but neither of
these views is plausible.
