{@Satvant@}¦ is the name of a people who are stated in the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> to belong to the south. In the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> the defeat by {@Bharata@} of the Satvants, and his
taking away the horse which they had prepared for an Aśva-
medha (‘horse sacrifice’), are referred to: this reference clearly
shows that in another passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the
text must be altered from {%satvanām%} to {%Satvatām,%} ‘of the Sat-
vants,’ against whom it seems the Bharatas made regular raids.
The name has also been found by the St. Petersburg Dictionary,
Cowell, and Max Müller in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad,<sup>4</sup> but it is
certain<sup>5</sup> that the reading there is not {%Satvan-Matsyeṣu,%} but
{%sa-Vaśa-Matsyeṣu.%}
