{@Satvant@}¦ is the name of a people who are stated in the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> to belong to the south. In the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> the defeat by {@Bharata@} of the Satvants, and his
<div n="lb"/>taking away the horse which they had prepared for an Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha (‘horse sacrifice’), are referred to: this reference clearly
<div n="lb"/>shows that in another passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>text must be altered from {%satvanām%} to {%Satvatām,%} ‘of the Sat-
<div n="lb"/>vants,’ against whom it seems the Bharatas made regular raids.
<div n="lb"/>The name has also been found by the St. Petersburg Dictionary,
<div n="lb"/>Cowell, and Max Müller in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad,<sup>4</sup> but it is
<div n="lb"/>certain<sup>5</sup> that the reading there is not {%Satvan-Matsyeṣu,%} but
<div n="lb"/>{%sa-Vaśa-Matsyeṣu.%}
