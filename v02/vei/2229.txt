{@Bhagī-ratha Aikṣvāka@}¦ (‘descendant of {@Ikṣvāku@}’) is the
name of a king in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iv. 6,
1. 2). It is important to note that he is regarded as being on
friendly terms with the {@Kuru-Pañcālas,@} which points to the
Ikṣvākus being allied to that people, and not belonging (as is
the case in the Buddhist books) to the east of India.
