{@Kavaṣa@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as one of
those whom, together with the {@Druhyu@} king, Indra overthrew
for the {@Tṛtsus.@} The Anukramaṇī (Index) also attributes to
him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda, including
two (x. 32. 33) that deal with a prince {@Kuruśravaṇa@} and his
descendant {@Upamaśravas.@} There seems no reason to doubt
this attribution, which is accepted by both Zimmer<sup>2</sup> and
Geldner.<sup>3</sup> The former holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of
the joint tribes named {@Vaikarṇa,@} in whom he sees the Kuru-
Krivi (Pañcāla) peoples, and that Kavaṣa in that capacity is
mentioned in the Rigveda as representative of those peoples.
He also suggests that the language of Rigveda x. 33, 4 is best
explained by the reduced position in which the Kuru-Krivis
found themselves on their defeat by the Tṛtsus. Ludwig,<sup>4</sup> on
the other hand, thinks that Kavaṣa was the priest of the five
peoples. Geldner<sup>5</sup> holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of
Kuruśravaṇa, by whose son, Upamaśravas, he was ill-treated,
and that he composed Rigveda x. 33 to deprecate the anger of
his royal master. Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks that he was a king.
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> mention is made of
[Page1-144+ 45]
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, who was a Brāhmaṇa born of a female slave,
and was reproached on this ground by the other Ṛṣis. He is
possibly identical with the Kavaṣa of the Rigveda.
