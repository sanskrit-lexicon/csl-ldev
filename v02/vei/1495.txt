28. {@Apabharaṇīs, Bharaṇīs,@}¦ or {@Bharaṇyas,@} ‘the bearers,’ is
<div n="lb"/>the name of the small triangle in the northern part of the Ram
<div n="lb"/>known as Musca or 35, 39, and 41 Arietis.
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras and the Months.%} — In the Brāhmaṇas the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatra names are regularly used to denote dates. This is
<div n="lb"/>done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may
<div n="lb"/>be turned into a feminine and compounded with {%pūrṇa-māsa,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘the full moon,’ as in {%Tiṣyā-pūrṇamāsa,%} ‘the full moon in the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatra Tiṣya.’<sup>103</sup> Much more often, however, it is turned
<div n="lb"/>into a derivative adjective, used with {%paurṇamāsī,%} ‘the full
[Page1-420+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>moon (night),’ or with {%amāvāsyā,%} ‘the new moon (night),’ as in
<div n="lb"/>{%Phālgunī paurṇamāsī,%} ‘the full-moon night in the Nakṣatra
<div n="lb"/>Phalgunī’;<sup>104</sup> or, as is usual in the Sūtras, the Nakṣatra adjec-
<div n="lb"/>tive alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month
<div n="lb"/>itself is called by a name derived<sup>105</sup> from that of a Nakṣatra,
<div n="lb"/>but only Phālguna,<sup>106</sup> Caitra,<sup>107</sup> Vaiśākha,<sup>108</sup> Taiṣya,<sup>109</sup> Māgha<sup>110</sup>
<div n="lb"/>occur in the Brāhmaṇas, the complete list later being Phālguna,
<div n="lb"/>Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyaiṣṭha, Āṣāḍha, Śrāvaṇa, Prauṣṭhapada,
<div n="lb"/>Āśvayuja, Kārttika, Mārgaśīrṣa, Taiṣya, Māgha. Strictly
<div n="lb"/>speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar
<div n="lb"/>year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as
<div n="lb"/>the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa there was a tendency to equate lunar
<div n="lb"/>months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up
<div n="lb"/>the solar year (see {@Māsa@}).
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras and Chronology.%} — (1) An endeavour has been
<div n="lb"/>made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at
<div n="lb"/>which the systematic employment of those names was intro-
<div n="lb"/>duced. Sir William Jones<sup>111</sup> refers to this possibility, and
<div n="lb"/>Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that Śrāvaṇa always
<div n="lb"/>marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the
<div n="lb"/>months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber<sup>112</sup> considered
<div n="lb"/>that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but
<div n="lb"/>Whitney<sup>113</sup> has convincingly shown that it is an impossible
<div n="lb"/>feat, and Thibaut<sup>114</sup> concurs in this view. Twelve became
<div n="lb"/>fixed as the number of the months because of the desire,
<div n="lb"/>evident in the Brāhmaṇas, somehow or other to harmonize
<div n="lb"/>lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Nakṣatras
<div n="lb"/>out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon
<div n="lb"/>can have no chronological significance, because full moon at
[Page1-421+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods
<div n="lb"/>occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly re-
<div n="lb"/>current intervals.
<div n="P"/>(2) All the lists of the Nakṣatras begin with Kṛttīkās. It is
<div n="lb"/>only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this
<div n="lb"/>fact. Now the later list of the Nakṣatras begins with Aśvinī,
<div n="lb"/>and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its
<div n="lb"/>adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star <lang n="greek">ζ</lang> Piscium
<div n="lb"/>on the border of Revatī and Aśvinī,<sup>115</sup> say in the course of the
<div n="lb"/>sixth century A.D. Weber<sup>116</sup> has therefore accepted the view
<div n="lb"/>that the Kṛttikās were chosen for a similar reason, and the
<div n="lb"/>date at which that Nakṣatra coincided with the vernal equinox
<div n="lb"/>has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C.<sup>117</sup>
<div n="lb"/>A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the
<div n="lb"/>sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with
<div n="lb"/>the Nakṣatras; and both Thibaut<sup>118</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>119</sup> have
<div n="lb"/>pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the
<div n="lb"/>equinox with the Kṛttikās. Jacobi<sup>120</sup> has contended that in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>121</sup> the commencement of the rains and the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the
<div n="lb"/>old, and that further the new year began with the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice in Phalgunī.<sup>121</sup> He has also referred to the distinction
<div n="lb"/>of the two sets of Deva and Yama Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup> as supporting his view of the connexion of the
<div n="lb"/>sun and the Nakṣatras. But this view is far from satisfactory:
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except
<div n="lb"/>by translating the word {%dvādaśa%}<sup>123</sup> as ‘the twelfth (month)’
<div n="lb"/>instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted
[Page1-422+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>interpretation; and the division of the Nakṣatras is not at all
<div n="lb"/>satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It
<div n="lb"/>may further be mentioned that even if the Nakṣatra of Kṛttikās
<div n="lb"/>be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with
<div n="lb"/>the vernal equinox, both Whitney<sup>124</sup> and Thibaut<sup>125</sup> are pre-
<div n="lb"/>pared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date
<div n="lb"/>given by the Jyotiṣa, which puts the winter solstice in Māgha.
<div n="P"/>(3) The winter solstice in Māgha is assured by a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>text, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>126</sup> expressly places it in the
<div n="lb"/>new moon of Māgha ({%māghasyāmāvāsyāyām%}). It is not very
<div n="lb"/>important whether we take this with the commentators<sup>127</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the
<div n="lb"/>day after full moon in Taiṣa, or, which is much more likely, as
<div n="lb"/>the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in
<div n="lb"/>Māgha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch
<div n="lb"/>in the following way. If the end of Revatī marked the vernal
<div n="lb"/>equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would
<div n="lb"/>enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox
<div n="lb"/>was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha,
<div n="lb"/>when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of
<div n="lb"/>Śraviṣṭhās. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third
<div n="lb"/>quarter of Bharaṇī, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from Śraviṣṭhās, and
<div n="lb"/>the difference between that and the beginning of Aśvinī=
[Page1-423+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)° (27 asterisms being = 360°). Taking the
<div n="lb"/>starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of Varāha Mihira,
<div n="lb"/>Jones<sup>128</sup> arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox
<div n="lb"/>corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha — that is, on the
<div n="lb"/>basis of 1° = 72 years as the precession. Pratt<sup>129</sup> arrived at
<div n="lb"/>precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and
<div n="lb"/>adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddhāntas
<div n="lb"/>of the junction star<sup>130</sup> of Maghā, <lang n="greek">α</lang> Leonis or Regulus. Davis<sup>131</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Colebrooke<sup>132</sup> arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by
<div n="lb"/>taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of Citrā,
<div n="lb"/>which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as
<div n="lb"/>3° in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century
<div n="lb"/>has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation
<div n="lb"/>in the Jyotiṣa,<sup>133</sup> it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney
<div n="lb"/>points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms
<div n="lb"/>coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)° extent
<div n="lb"/>each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups
<div n="lb"/>of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the
<div n="lb"/>result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions
<div n="lb"/>was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether
<div n="lb"/>out of their asterisms.<sup>134</sup> Nor can we say that the star <lang n="greek">ζ</lang> Piscium
<div n="lb"/>early formed the eastern boundary of Revatī; it may possibly
<div n="lb"/>not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote
<div n="lb"/>from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to Revatī.
<div n="lb"/>Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point — 
<div n="lb"/>582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants<sup>135</sup> — is the fact that
<div n="lb"/>the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determin-
<div n="lb"/>able by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate
<div n="lb"/>observers, since they made no precise determination of the
[Page1-424+ 78]
<div n="lb"/>number of days of the year, which even in the Jyotiṣa they do
<div n="lb"/>not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even
<div n="lb"/>the Sūrya Siddhānta<sup>136</sup> does not know the precession of the
<div n="lb"/>equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years
<div n="lb"/>for possible errors,<sup>137</sup> and the only probable conclusion to be
<div n="lb"/>drawn from the datum of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa is that it
<div n="lb"/>was recording an observation which must have been made some
<div n="lb"/>centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the
<div n="lb"/>probable date of the Brāhmaṇa literature,<sup>138</sup> say B.C. 800-600.
<div n="P"/>(4) Another chronological argument has been derived from
<div n="lb"/>the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for
<div n="lb"/>Phālguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year,
<div n="lb"/>since the full moon in Phalgunī is often described as the
<div n="lb"/>‘mouth ({%mukham%}) of the year.’<sup>139</sup> Jacobi<sup>140</sup> considers that this
[Page1-425+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter
<div n="lb"/>solstice, which would coincide with the month of Phālguna
<div n="lb"/>about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg<sup>141</sup> and Thibaut,<sup>142</sup> on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, maintain that the choice of Phālguna as the ‘mouth’ of
<div n="lb"/>the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This
<div n="lb"/>view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence<sup>143</sup>
<div n="lb"/>of the correspondence of Phālguna and the beginning of spring:
<div n="lb"/>as we have seen above in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, the new
<div n="lb"/>moon in Māgha is placed at the winter solstice,<sup>144</sup> which puts
<div n="lb"/>the full moon of Phalgunī at a month and a half after the
<div n="lb"/>winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in
<div n="lb"/>itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with
<div n="lb"/>the February 7 of the {%veris initium%} in the Roman Calendar.
<div n="lb"/>This fact accords with the only natural division of the year
<div n="lb"/>into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from
<div n="lb"/>June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set
<div n="lb"/>of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see
<div n="lb"/>{@Cāturmāsya@}). Tilak,<sup>145</sup> on the other hand, holds that the
<div n="lb"/>winter solstice coincided with Māghī full moon at the time of the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Phālgunī
<div n="lb"/>and Caitrī in early periods — viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 6000-
<div n="lb"/>4000.
<div n="P"/>(5) The passages of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>146</sup> and the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>147</sup> which treat the full moon in Phālguna as
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon
<div n="lb"/>in Caitra. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to
<div n="lb"/>secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of
<div n="lb"/>spring,<sup>148</sup> and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period
[Page1-426+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>when the winter solstice corresponded with Caitra. Another
<div n="lb"/>alternative is the Ekāṣṭakā, interpreted by the commentators as
<div n="lb"/>the eighth day after the full moon in Maghās, a time which
<div n="lb"/>might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old
<div n="lb"/>year, well be considered as representing the end of the year.
<div n="lb"/>A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full
<div n="lb"/>moon meant must be that of Caitra, as Ālekhana quoted by
<div n="lb"/>Āpastamba held, not of Māgha, as Āśmarathya, Laugākṣi and
<div n="lb"/>the Mīmāṃsists believed, and as Tilak believes.<sup>149</sup>
<div n="P"/>(6) Others, again, according to the Gṛhya ritual, began the
<div n="lb"/>year with the month Mārgaśīrṣa, as is shown by its other name
<div n="lb"/>Āgrahāyaṇa<sup>150</sup> (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’).
<div n="lb"/>Jacobi and Tilak<sup>151</sup> think that this one denoted the autumn
<div n="lb"/>equinox in Mṛgaśiras, corresponding to the winter solstice in
<div n="lb"/>Phalgunī. But, as Thibaut<sup>152</sup> shows clearly, it was selected as
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with
<div n="lb"/>autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with Caitra
<div n="lb"/>instead of Phālguna.<sup>153</sup>
<div n="P"/>(7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bühler,<sup>154</sup>
<div n="lb"/>from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhya Sūtras, on the principle that study commenced with the
<div n="lb"/>rains (as in the Buddhist {%vassā%}) which mark the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice. He concludes that if Bhādrapada appears as the
<div n="lb"/>date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus
<div n="lb"/>because at one time Proṣṭhapadās (the early name of Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>padās) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the
<div n="lb"/>case when the winter solstice was in Phālguna. But Whitney<sup>155</sup>
<div n="lb"/>has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we
<div n="lb"/>cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the
<div n="lb"/>rains and learning — a month like Śrāvaṇa might be preferred
[Page1-427+ 89]
<div n="lb"/>because of its connexion with the word Śravaṇa, ‘ear’ — and
<div n="lb"/>in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that
<div n="lb"/>Bhādrapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence
<div n="lb"/>with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so
<div n="lb"/>to coincide.<sup>156</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The Origin of the Nakṣatras.%} — As we have seen, there is no
<div n="lb"/>evidence showing the process by which the Nakṣatras may
[Page1-428+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in
<div n="lb"/>the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of
<div n="lb"/>them are found in the latest parts of that Saṃhitā, and finally
<div n="lb"/>in the later Atharvaveda and in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās the
<div n="lb"/>full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians
<div n="lb"/>show (see {@Graha@}) a remarkably small knowledge of the other
<div n="lb"/>astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar
<div n="lb"/>mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very
<div n="lb"/>complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star
<div n="lb"/>group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus
<div n="lb"/>impossible {%a priori%} to deny that the Vedic Indians could have
<div n="lb"/>invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac.<sup>157</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist
<div n="lb"/>two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in
<div n="lb"/>China, the Manāzil and the Sieou. The use of the Manāzil in
<div n="lb"/>Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by
<div n="lb"/>them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with
<div n="lb"/>the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might
<div n="lb"/>therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a
<div n="lb"/>mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the
<div n="lb"/>Manāzil is long posterior to that for the existence of the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old
<div n="lb"/>Testament<sup>158</sup> may really be the lunar mansions.<sup>159</sup> That the
<div n="lb"/>Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess<sup>160</sup> held, is,
<div n="lb"/>on the other hand, not at all probable.
<div n="P"/>Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers
<div n="lb"/>published by him between 1839 and 1861,<sup>161</sup> attempted to prove
[Page1-429+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>the derivation of the Nakṣatra from the Chinese Sieou. The
<div n="lb"/>latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all.
<div n="lb"/>He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern
<div n="lb"/>astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars
<div n="lb"/>observed in the neighbourhood can be referred; they were, as
<div n="lb"/>regards twenty-four of them, selected about B.C. 2357 on
<div n="lb"/>account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having
<div n="lb"/>the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had
<div n="lb"/>attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were
<div n="lb"/>added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices
<div n="lb"/>of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with
<div n="lb"/>Mao (= Kṛttikās), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357.
<div n="lb"/>Weber,<sup>162</sup> in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory,
<div n="lb"/>and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for
<div n="lb"/>the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third
<div n="lb"/>century B.C. The last point does not appear<sup>163</sup> to be correct,
<div n="lb"/>but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were rein-
<div n="lb"/>forced by Whitney,<sup>164</sup> who insisted that Biot's supposition of
<div n="lb"/>the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of
<div n="lb"/>lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest
<div n="lb"/>defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Léopold
<div n="lb"/>de Saussure,<sup>165</sup> , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin
<div n="lb"/>for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg,<sup>166</sup>
<div n="lb"/>who has also pointed out<sup>167</sup> that the series does not begin with
<div n="lb"/>Mao (= Kṛttikās).
<div n="P"/>There remains only the possibility that a common source for
<div n="lb"/>all the three sets — Nakṣatra, Manāzil, and Sieou — may be
<div n="lb"/>found in Babylonia. Hommel<sup>168</sup> has endeavoured to show
<div n="lb"/>that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence
<div n="lb"/>of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the
[Page1-430+ 120]
<div n="lb"/>Pleiades (= Kṛttikās); but Thibaut's researches<sup>169</sup> are not
<div n="lb"/>favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber,<sup>170</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Whitney,<sup>171</sup> Zimmer,<sup>172</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>173</sup> all incline to the
<div n="lb"/>view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system,
<div n="lb"/>and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable
<div n="lb"/>view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas,<sup>174</sup> and possibly the word {@Manā.@}

<F>156) Mention should here be made of
<div n="lb"/>the following points: (1) Jacobi's argu-
<div n="lb"/>ment from the word Dhruva, the name
<div n="lb"/>of the star pointed out to the bride in
<div n="lb"/>the marriage ritual. The word does
<div n="lb"/>not occur in the literature anterior to
<div n="lb"/>the Gṛhya Sūtras, and it must remain
<div n="lb"/>an undecided question whether the
<div n="lb"/>practice was or was not old. Jacobi
<div n="lb"/>urges that Dhruva means ‘fixed,’ and
<div n="lb"/>that it must originally have referred to
<div n="lb"/>a real fixed pole star, and he thinks
<div n="lb"/>that such a star could only be found
<div n="lb"/>in the third millennium B.C. Whitney
<div n="lb"/>and Oldenberg definitely reject this
<div n="lb"/>view on the ground that too much
<div n="lb"/>must not be made out of a piece of
<div n="lb"/>folk-lore, and that the marriage ritual
<div n="lb"/>requirements would be satisfied by any
<div n="lb"/>star of some magnitude which was
<div n="lb"/>approximately polar. This conclusion
<div n="lb"/>seems convincing. {%Cf.%} Keith, {%Journal%}
<div n="lb"/>{%of the Royal Asiatic Society,%} 1909, 1102;
<div n="lb"/>1910, 465; {%contra,%} Jacobi, {%ibid.,%} 1909,
<div n="lb"/>726 {%et seq.;%} 1910, 464. (2) The Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 3, asserts
<div n="lb"/>that the Kṛttikās do not move from
<div n="lb"/>the eastern quarter, which the others
<div n="lb"/>do; and stress has been laid (by Jacobi,
<div n="lb"/>{%Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,%} 1910,
<div n="lb"/>463, 464) upon this assertion as giving
<div n="lb"/>a date of the third millennium B.C. for
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha observation. But this
<div n="lb"/>notice is quite inadequate to support
<div n="lb"/>any such result, and its lack of trust-
<div n="lb"/>worthiness as a chronological guide is
<div n="lb"/>increased by the fact that the Baudhā-
<div n="lb"/>yana Śrauta Sūtra, xviii 5, has a similar
<div n="lb"/>notice, coupled with another notice,
<div n="lb"/>which, according to Barth, would only
<div n="lb"/>be true somewhere in or after the sixth
<div n="lb"/>century A.D., the equatorial point being
<div n="lb"/>placed between Citrā and Svātī, which
<div n="lb"/>in the early period were both very
<div n="lb"/>much north of the equator (see Caland,
<div n="lb"/>{%Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana,%}
<div n="lb"/>37-39). The same passage of the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 2, in the
<div n="lb"/>Mādhyaṃdina recension, states that
<div n="lb"/>the number of the Kṛttikās is greater
<div n="lb"/>than that of the stars in any of the
<div n="lb"/>other Nakṣatras, which consist of one,
<div n="lb"/>two, three, or four stars, or which,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Kāṇva recension (see
<div n="lb"/>Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%} 12,
<div n="lb"/>282, n. 2), have four stars. It is not
<div n="lb"/>possible to put much faith in this asser-
<div n="lb"/>tion, for Hasta later has five stars, and
<div n="lb"/>its name (with reference to the fingers)
<div n="lb"/>suggests five ({%cf.%} Weber, {%Naxatra,%} 2,
<div n="lb"/>368, 381), and that number is possibly
<div n="lb"/>referred to in the Rigveda (i. 105, 10).
<div n="lb"/>See Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 3, 177.
<div n="lb"/>(3) Attempts have been made to regard
<div n="lb"/>the names of the Nakṣatras as signifi-
<div n="lb"/>cant of their position in the list. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Bentley, {%Historical View,%} 2, thought
<div n="lb"/>Viśākhā was so called because the
<div n="lb"/>equinoctial colure divided the equator
<div n="lb"/>about 1426 B.C.; this is refuted by
<div n="lb"/>Tilak, {%Orion,%} 57 {%et seq.%} Jyeṣṭhaghnī
<div n="lb"/>has been interpreted as ‘slaying the
<div n="lb"/>eldest’ — {%i.e.,%} as marking the new year
<div n="lb"/>by putting an end to the old year.
<div n="lb"/>Tilak, 90, suggests that Mūla was so
<div n="lb"/>called because its acronycal rising
<div n="lb"/>marked the beginning of the year when
<div n="lb"/>the vernal equinox was near Mṛgaśiras.
<div n="lb"/>More probable is Whitney's view, {%Sārya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Siddhānta,%} 194, that it was the most
<div n="lb"/>southern, and so, as it were, the basis
<div n="lb"/>of the asterisms.</F>
