{@Kāśi, Kāśya.@}¦ — The name Kāśi denotes (in the plural<sup>1</sup>) the
people of Kāśi (Benares), and Kāśya, the king of Kāśi. The
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> tells of {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra,@} king of Kāśi, who
was defeated by {@Śatānīka Sātrājita,@} with the result that the
Kāśis, down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa, gave up the kindling
of the sacred fire. Sātrājita was a {@Bharata.@} We hear also of
{@Ajātaśatru@} as a king of Kāśi;<sup>3</sup> and no doubt {@Bhadrasena@}
{@Ajātaśatrava,@} a contemporary of {@Uddālaka,@} was also a king of
Kāśi.
<div n="P"/>The Kāśis and {@Videhas@} were closely connected, as was
natural in view of their geographical position. The compound
name Kāśi-Videha occurs in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;<sup>4</sup> in the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>5</sup> {@Gārgī@} describes Ajātaśatru as either
a Kāśi or a Videha king. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
[Page1-154+ 49]
mentions one Purohita as acting for the kings of Kāśi, Kosala,
and Videha; and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>7</sup> mentions Kāśi
and Videha in close proximity. Weber,<sup>8</sup> indeed, throws out
the suggestion that the Kāśis and the Videhas together con-
stitute the {@Uśīnaras,@} whose name is very rare in Vedic
literature.
<div n="P"/>As Kosala and Videha were in close connexion, Kāśi and
Kosala are found combined in the compound name Kāśi-
Kauśalyas of the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though Kāśi is a late word, it is quite possible that the town
is older, as the river {@Varaṇāvatī@} referred to in the Athar-
vaveda<sup>10</sup> may be connected with the later Vārāṇasī (Benares).
<div n="P"/>It is significant that while the Kāśis, Kosalas, and Videhas
were united, any relations which the Kuru-Pañcala peoples
may have had with them were hostile. It is a fair conclusion
that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist
some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture
in some degree. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> in the story of the
advance of Āryan civilization over Kosala and Videha, preserves
a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in
the Kuru-Pañcāla country lay the real centre of the Brāhmaṇa
culture (see also {@Kuru-Pañcāla@}). That the Kosala-Videhas
were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pañcālas
is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the
true Brāhmaṇa culture appears to have been brought to them
from the Kuru-Pañcala country. It is very probable that the
East was less Āryan than the West, and that it was less
completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the
movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts<sup>12</sup>
reveal a position in which the Kṣatriyas rank above Brāhmaṇas.
With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts<sup>13</sup> display
[Page1-155+ 43]
towards the people of Magadha a marked antipathy, which
may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy,
and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā.<sup>14</sup> It is, of course, possible that the Kosala-Videhas
and Kāśis actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later
known as the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that they by reason of
distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost
their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears
less likely, though it might be supported by a literal inter-
pretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup>
