{@Dundubhi,@}¦ apparently an onomatopoetic word, means ‘drum,’
as used in both war and peace. It is often mentioned from
the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards.<sup>2</sup> A special sort of drum was the ‘earth
drum,’ made by digging a hole in the ground and covering it
with a hide. This was employed in the Mahāvrata, a rite
performed at the winter solstice, for the purpose of driving
away influences hostile to the return of the sun.<sup>3</sup> A ‘drum-
beater’ is included in the list of sacrificial victims at the
Puruṣamedha or ‘human sacrifice.’<sup>4</sup>
