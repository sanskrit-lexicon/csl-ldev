{@Gārgya,@}¦ ‘descendant of Garga,’ is the patronymic of {@Bālāki@}
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka<sup>1</sup> and the Kauṣītaki<sup>2</sup> Upaniṣads. Two
Gārgyas are mentioned in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers)
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad:<sup>3</sup> one of them is the pupil of
Gārgya, who again is the pupil of Gautama. Others occur
in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>4</sup> and in the Nirukta,<sup>5</sup> as well as later
in the ritual Sūtras. Thus the family was evidently long
connected with the development of liturgy and grammar.
