{@Dāya@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> only in the sense of ‘reward’
of exertion ({%śrama%}), but later it means ‘inheritance’ — that is,
a father's property which is to be divided among his sons
either during his lifetime or after his death. The passages all
negative the idea that the property of the family was legally
family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head
of the house, usually the father, and that the other members
of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father
could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they
were physically stronger.
<div n="P"/>Thus {@Manu@} is said in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> to have divided
his property among his sons. He omitted {@Nābhānediṣṭha,@}
[Page1-352+ 66]
whom he afterwards taught how to appease the Aṅgirases, and
to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the
property he divided was movable property, rather than land
({@Urvarā@}). In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the division is said to
have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left
only their aged father to Nābhānediṣṭha. According to the
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> again, four sons divided the inheritance
while their old father, Abhipratārin, was still alive. It is,
of course, possible to regard Dāya as denoting the heritable
property of the family, but the developed {%patria potestas%} of the
father, which was early very marked, as shown by the legend
of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} is inconsistent with the view that the sons
were legally owners with their father, unless and until. they
actually insisted on a division of the property.<sup>5</sup> Probably — 
there is no evidence of any decisive character — land was not
divided at first, but no doubt its disposal began to follow the
analogy of cattle and other movable property as soon as the
available supply of arable land became limited.
<div n="P"/>As for the method of division, it is clear from the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> that the elder son was usually preferred; perhaps
[Page1-353+ 50]
this was always the case after death. During the father's life-
time another might be preferred, as appears from a passage
of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup> Women were excluded from
partition or inheritance, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup>
and the Nirukta.<sup>9</sup> They were, no doubt, supported by their
brothers; but if they had none they might be reduced to prosti-
tution.<sup>10</sup> Detailed rules of inheritance appear in the Sūtras.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The heir is called Dayada,<sup>12</sup> ‘receiver ({%ā-da%}) of inheritance.’

<F>5) The same question has been raised
as to the origin of English or Teutonic
property in land generally. Against
any idea even of family ownership in
a strict sense of the word, see Fustel

{%et seq.%} The older view, which accepted
family and communal ownership, repre-
sented in different forms by Maine ({%Vil-%}
{%lage Communities in the East and West%}),
Stubbs, Green, and others, is defended
in a new form by Vinogradoff, {%Villanage%}
{%in England.%} See also Keith, {%Journal%}
{%of the African Society,%} 6, 201 {%et seq.%}
Jolly, {%Recht und Sitte,%} 93-96, does not
accept the communal ownership of land,
but, {%ibid.,%} 80, is inclined to believe in
the joint ownership of a family. He
admits that this is inconsistent with the
strict rule of {%patria potestas,%} which still
exists in Bengal; Baden Powell, {%Village%}
{%Communities in India,%} 133 {%et seq.,%} doubts
the existence in early India of such a
{%patria potestas.%} But the facts seem clearly
to show that there was such a power,
and that the father owned the property.
His sons, as they grew up, came to
claim the property, and he might have
to divide it; hence the idea naturally
developed that every child on birth had
a legal share in the property. No doubt
also from the first the right to part with
land was one which grown-up sons and
the rest of the community could object
to, once the village had acquired a fixed
existence. This would account ade-
quately for the later system. {%Cf.%} also
