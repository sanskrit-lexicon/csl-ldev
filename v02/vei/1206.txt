{@Trasa-dasyu,@}¦ son of {@Purukutsa,@}<sup>1</sup> is mentioned in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>as king of the Pūrus.<sup>2</sup> He was born to Purukutsa by his wife,
<div n="lb"/>{@Purukutsānī,@} at a time of great distress;<sup>3</sup> this, according to
<div n="lb"/>Sāyaṇa, refers to Purukutsa's captivity: possibly his death is
<div n="lb"/>really meant. Trasadasyu was also a descendant of Girikṣit,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Purukutsa was a descendant of Durgaha. The genealogy,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, appears to be: Durgaha, Girikṣit, Purukutsa, Trasa-
<div n="lb"/>dasyu. Trasadasyu was the ancestor of {@Tṛkṣi,@}<sup>5</sup> and, according
<div n="lb"/>to Ludwig,<sup>6</sup> had a son Hiraṇin. Trasadasyu's chronological
<div n="lb"/>position is determined by the fact that his father, Purukutsa,
<div n="lb"/>was a contemporary of Sudās, either as an opponent<sup>7</sup> or as
<div n="lb"/>a friend.<sup>8</sup> That Purukutsa was an enemy of Sudās is more
<div n="lb"/>probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divodāsa, was
<div n="lb"/>apparently<sup>9</sup> at enmity with the Pūrus, and in the battle of the
<div n="lb"/>ten kings Pūrus were ranged against Sudās and the Tṛtsus.
<div n="lb"/>Trasadasyu himself seems to have been an energetic king.
<div n="lb"/>His people, the Pūrus, were settled on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>10</sup> which
<div n="lb"/>was, no doubt, the stream in the middle country, that locality
<div n="lb"/>according well with the later union of the Pūrus with the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuru@} people, who inhabited that country. This union is
<div n="lb"/>exemplified in the person of {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} who is called
<div n="lb"/>Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>whose father was {@Mitrātithi,@} and whose son was {@Upamaśravas.@}
<div n="lb"/>The relation of Mitrātithi to Tṛkṣi does not appear.
<div n="P"/>Another descendant of Trasadasyu was {@Tryaruṇa Traivṛṣṇa,@}
<div n="lb"/>who is simply called Trasadasyu in a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>12</sup>
[Page1-328+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>He was not only a ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ but, according
<div n="lb"/>to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> he was also Traidhātva,
<div n="lb"/>‘descendant of Tridhātu.’ The order of these two predecessors
<div n="lb"/>of Tryaruṇa cannot be determined in any way from Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature. According to the later tradition,<sup>14</sup> a prince named
<div n="lb"/>Tridhanvan preceded Tryaruṇa in the succession. Vedic tradi-
<div n="lb"/>tion further fails to show in what precise relation Trasadasyu
<div n="lb"/>stood to Trivṛṣan or Tryaruṇa.
<div n="P"/>Trasdasyu Paurukutsa appears in several Brāhmaṇas<sup>15</sup> as a
<div n="lb"/>famous sacrificer of ancient times, together with {@Para Āṭṇāra,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vītahavya Śrāyasa,@} and {@Kakṣīvant Auśija,@} who in the
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> are called ‘ancient great
<div n="lb"/>kings’ ({%pūrve mahārājāḥ%}).
