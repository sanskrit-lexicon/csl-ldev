{@Opaśa@}¦ is a word of somewhat doubtful sense, occurring in
the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> and occasionally later.<sup>3</sup> It
probably means a ‘plait’ as used in dressing the hair, especially
of women,<sup>4</sup> but apparently, in earlier times,<sup>5</sup> of men also.
The goddess Sinīvālī is called {%svaupaśā,%}<sup>6</sup> an epithet of doubtful
sense, from which Zimmer<sup>7</sup> conjectures that the wearing of
[Page1-125+ 50]
false plaits of hair was not unknown in Vedic times. What
was the difference between the braids referred to in the
epithets {%pṛthu ṣṭuka,%}<sup>8</sup> ‘having broad braids,’ and {%viṣita-ṣṭuka,%}<sup>9</sup>
‘having loosened braids,’ and the Opaśa cannot be made out
from the evidence available. Geldner<sup>10</sup> thinks that the original
sense was ‘horn,’ and that when the word applies to Indra<sup>11</sup>
it means ‘diadem.’
