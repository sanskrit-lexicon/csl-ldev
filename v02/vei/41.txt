{@Atithi-gva.@}¦ — This name occurs frequently in the Rigveda,
apparently applying, in nearly all cases, to the same king,
otherwise called {@Divodāsa.@} The identity of the two persons
has been denied by Bergaigne,<sup>1</sup> but is certainly proved by a
number of passages, when the two names occur together,<sup>2</sup> in
connection with the defeat of {@Śambara.@} In other passages<sup>3</sup>
Atithigva is said to have assisted Indra in slaying Parṇaya and
Karañja. Sometimes he is only vaguely referred to, while once<sup>5</sup> he
is mentioned as an enemy of Turvaśa and Yadu. Again<sup>6</sup> Atithigva
is coupled with {@Āyu@} and {@Kutsa@} as defeated by {@Tūrvayāṇa.@}
<div n="P"/>A different Atithigva appears to be referred to in a Dānastuti<sup>7</sup>
(‘Praise of Gifts’), where his son, {@Indrota,@} is mentioned.
<div n="P"/>Roth<sup>8</sup> distinguishes three Atithigvas — the Atithigva Divodāsa,
the enemy of Parṇaya and Karañja, and the enemy of Tūrvayāṇa.
But the various passages can be reconciled, especially if it is
admitted that Atithigva Divodāsa was already an ancient hero
in the earliest hymns, and was becoming almost mythical.
