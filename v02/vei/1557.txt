{@Nāva-prabhraṃśana,@}¦ the ‘sliding down of the ship,’ is read
<div n="lb"/>in Whitney and Roth's text of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and has been
<div n="lb"/>connected by Weber<sup>2</sup> and others<sup>3</sup> with Manor Avasarpaṇa, the
<div n="lb"/>name in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> of the northern mountain
<div n="lb"/>on which Manu's ship settled on the subsidence of the deluge.
<div n="lb"/>But both Bloomfield<sup>5</sup> and Whitney<sup>6</sup> point out that this inter-
<div n="lb"/>pretation is highly improbable, and this view is accepted by
[Page1-448+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>Macdonell.<sup>7</sup> The expression is analyzed as {%na ava-prabhraṃśana%}
<div n="lb"/>by the Pada text and the commentator alike, and is never found
<div n="lb"/>elsewhere with reference to the descent of a boat or ship.<sup>8</sup>
