{@Ā-śrama@}¦ (‘resting-place’) does not occur in any Upaniṣad
<div n="lb"/>which can be regarded as pre-Buddhistic. Its earliest use as
<div n="lb"/>denoting the stages of a Hindu's life is found in the Śvetāśvatara
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> In one passage<sup>2</sup> of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
<div n="lb"/>reference is made only to the {@Brahmacārin@} and householder, to
<div n="lb"/>whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the
<div n="lb"/>practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures,
<div n="lb"/>and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In
<div n="lb"/>another place<sup>3</sup> three states are contemplated, but not as con-
<div n="lb"/>secutive. The Brahmacārin may either become a householder
<div n="lb"/>or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his
<div n="lb"/>life. Similarly, reference<sup>4</sup> is made to the death of the anchorite
<div n="lb"/>in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all
<div n="lb"/>three<sup>5</sup> is the man who stands fast in Brahman (Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>saṃstha). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>6</sup> the knower of the
<div n="lb"/>Ātman is contrasted with those who (1) study, or (2) sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>and give alms, or (3) are anchorites, and in another place<sup>7</sup> with
<div n="lb"/>those who sacrifice and make benefactions, and those who
<div n="lb"/>practice asceticism. This position of superiority to, and
<div n="lb"/>distinction from, the Āśramas became later a fourth<sup>8</sup> Āśrama,
[Page1-069+ 35]
<div n="lb"/>the {@Gṛhastha,@} or householder, who was in the second stage,
<div n="lb"/>being required to pass not only into the stage of {@Vānaprastha,@}
<div n="lb"/>but also that of the Sannyāsin ({@Bhikṣu, Parivrājaka@}). The
<div n="lb"/>first stage, that of the {@Brahmacārin,@} was still obligatory, but
<div n="lb"/>was no longer allowed to remain a permanent one, as was
<div n="lb"/>originally possible.
