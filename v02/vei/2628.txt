{@Ratha-kāra,@}¦ ‘chariot-maker,’ is mentioned in the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>1</sup> as one of those who are to be subject to the king, seeming
<div n="lb"/>to stand generally as an example of the industrial population.
<div n="lb"/>He is also referred to in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>2</sup> and in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas:<sup>3</sup> in all these passages, as well a probably in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda also, the Rathakāra already forms a caste. The
[Page2-204+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>later system<sup>4</sup> regards the Rathakāra as the offspring of a
<div n="lb"/>Māhiṣya (the son of a Kṣatriya husband and a Vaiśya wife) and
<div n="lb"/>a Karaṇī (the daughter of a Vaiśya husband and a Śūdra wife),
<div n="lb"/>but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is
<div n="lb"/>historically accurate. The Rathakāras must rather be deemed
<div n="lb"/>to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> suggests that
<div n="lb"/>the {@Anu@} tribe formed the basis of the Rathakāra caste, referring
<div n="lb"/>to their worship of the Ṛbhus, who are, of course, the chariot-
<div n="lb"/>makers {%par excellence.%} But there is little ground for this view.
