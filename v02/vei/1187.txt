{@Tṛtsu@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular<sup>1</sup> and several
<div n="lb"/>times in the plural,<sup>2</sup> as a proper name. The Tṛtsus were
<div n="lb"/>clearly helpers of {@Sudās@} in the great battle against the ten
<div n="lb"/>kings, {@Śimyu,@} the {@Turvaśa,@} the {@Druhyu, Kavaṣa,@} the {@Pūru,@}
<div n="lb"/>the {@Anu, Bheda, Śambara,@} the two {@Vaikarṇas,@} and perhaps
<div n="lb"/>the {@Yadu,@} who led with them as allies<sup>3</sup> the {@Matsyas, Pakthas,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Bhalānas, Alinas, Viṣāṇins, Śivas, Ajas, Śigrus,@} and perhaps
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣus.<sup>4</sup> The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one
[Page1-321+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> and is evidently alluded to in two
<div n="lb"/>others.<sup>6</sup> The great battle took place on the {@Paruṣṇī,@} but there
<div n="lb"/>was also a fight on the {@Yamunā@} with Bheda, the Ajas, Śigrus,
<div n="lb"/>and Yakṣus. As the Yamunā and the Parusṇī represent
<div n="lb"/>opposite ends of the territory of the Tṛtsus (for we cannot
<div n="lb"/>with Hopkins<sup>7</sup> safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see
<div n="lb"/>exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should
<div n="lb"/>be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two
<div n="lb"/>later hymns,<sup>6</sup> and not in the hymn<sup>5</sup> describing the battle itself;
<div n="lb"/>besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as
<div n="lb"/>advancing to the {@Vipāś@} and {@Śutudrī.@}<sup>8</sup> Roth ingeniously
<div n="lb"/>brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies
<div n="lb"/>by Sudās, which is celebrated in the seventh book of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda — a book attributed to the Vasiṣṭha family — and thought
<div n="lb"/>that there was a reference in one verse<sup>9</sup> to the defeat of the
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas by Sudās. But it seems certain that the verse is
<div n="lb"/>mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as
<div n="lb"/>victors with Sudās.<sup>10</sup> Ludwig<sup>11</sup> accordingly identifies the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg,<sup>12</sup> after accepting this
<div n="lb"/>view at first,<sup>13</sup> later expressed the opinion that the Tṛtsus were
<div n="lb"/>the priests of the Bharata people, and therefore identical with
<div n="lb"/>the Vasiṣṭhas. This view is supported by the fact that in one
<div n="lb"/>passage<sup>14</sup> the Tṛtsus are clearly described as wearing their
<div n="lb"/>hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasiṣṭhas,<sup>15</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasiṣṭhas.
[Page1-322+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>But Geldner<sup>16</sup> has suggested with great probability that Tṛtsu,
<div n="lb"/>who is once mentioned in the singular,<sup>17</sup> means the Tṛtsu
<div n="lb"/>king — that is, Sudās.<sup>18</sup> This explanation alone justifies the
<div n="lb"/>description<sup>19</sup> of the Bharatas as {%Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ,%}<sup>20</sup> ‘subjects of
<div n="lb"/>the Tṛtsus,’ meaning the Tṛtsu Gotra or family, for the people
<div n="lb"/>could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭhas might be called Tṛtsus because of their close con-
<div n="lb"/>nexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse
<div n="lb"/>process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by
<div n="lb"/>the fact that the {@Pratṛdaḥ@} are referred to as receiving Vasiṣṭha.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This name of the Tṛtsu dynasty is probably older than its
<div n="lb"/>connexion with Vasiṣṭha in the time of Sudās, a conclusion
<div n="lb"/>supported by the name of {@Pratardana,@} who is mentioned later
<div n="lb"/>as a descendant of Divodāsa,<sup>22</sup> an ancestor of Sudās. The
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsu dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭhas. For the further history of the dynasty and its
<div n="lb"/>relation with Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, see {@Sudās.@}
<div n="P"/>If the Tṛtsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the
<div n="lb"/>territory between the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā, it is clear<sup>23</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that later on they coalesced with the Pūrus and probably
<div n="lb"/>others of those tribes to form the {@Kuru@} people. Already in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>24</sup> the Tṛtsus are allied with the {@Sṛñjayas,@} and in
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>25</sup> one Purohita serves both Kurus
<div n="lb"/>and Sṛñjayas.
[Page1-323+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt<sup>26</sup> considers that the Tṛtsus cannot be identified
<div n="lb"/>with the Bharatas, but that Sudās and the Bharatas represent
<div n="lb"/>an invading body, which, however, became allied with the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus and the Vasiṣṭha priests. He also thinks that the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda reveals a time when {@Divodāsa,@} the grandfather or
<div n="lb"/>ancestor of Sudās, was living in Arachosia, on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
<div n="lb"/>and warring against the {@Paṇis,@} whom he identifies with the
<div n="lb"/>Parnians. But this conjecture<sup>27</sup> cannot be regarded as
<div n="lb"/>probable. In the Sarasvatī<sup>28</sup> it is not necessary to see any
<div n="lb"/>other river than the later Sarasvatī, in the middle country,
<div n="lb"/>which flowed within the boundaries of the Tṛtsus: it is also
<div n="lb"/>significant that there are references<sup>29</sup> to contests between
<div n="lb"/>{@Turvaśa Yadu@} and Atithigva or Divodāsa. Thus there is no
<div n="lb"/>reason to doubt that Divodāsa and the Bharatas were in the
<div n="lb"/>middle country, and not in Iran.

<F>3) They were regarded as enemies of
<div n="lb"/>the kings by Roth, {%Zur Litteratur und%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Geschichte des Weda,%} 95, and by Zimmer,
<div n="lb"/>{%op. cit.,%} 126, The latter, however,
<div n="lb"/>altered his view (see pp. 430, 431,
<div n="lb"/>which Hopkins, {%op. cit.,%} 260, has over-
<div n="lb"/>looked), and there is no doubt that
<div n="lb"/>the later opinion is correct. {%Cf.%} also
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>3, 173; Hopkins, 260, 261. Of these
<div n="lb"/>tribes the Pakthas, Alinas, Bhalānas,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣāṇins, and Śivas, were probably
<div n="lb"/>settled in the north-west, to the west
<div n="lb"/>of the Indus, and around the Kabul
<div n="lb"/>River. The Anus, Pūrus, Turvaśas,
<div n="lb"/>Yadus, and Druhyus, were probably
<div n="lb"/>tribes of the Panjab; the Ajas, Śigrus,
<div n="lb"/>and Yakṣus, tribes of the east, under
<div n="lb"/>Bheda; Śambara may also have been
<div n="lb"/>a native of the east; Śimyu and Kavaṣa
<div n="lb"/>are doubtful; and the Vaikarṇau prob-
<div n="lb"/>ably belonged to the north-west.</F>
<F>4) This is uncertain; the text of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, vii. 18, 6, has Yakṣu, and
<div n="lb"/>the same word recurs in verse 19. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, the word Yadu would
<div n="lb"/>naturally be expected in verse 6, as Tur-
<div n="lb"/>vaśa is mentioned. Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Leben,%} 122, says that Yadu occurs in
<div n="lb"/>vii. 18, but on p. 126 he cites Yakṣu
<div n="lb"/>in both places, evidently by oversight.
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins, {%Journal of the American Oriental%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Society,%} 15, 261, n., considers that Tur-
<div n="lb"/>vaśa, the Yakṣu, is a sarcastic expres-
<div n="lb"/>sion, instead of Turvaśa, the Yadu,
<div n="lb"/>making Turvaśa, whom he regards as
<div n="lb"/>king of the Yadus, ridiculous as a
<div n="lb"/>member of an insignificant people, and
<div n="lb"/>alluding to him also as a sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>victim (as it were, {%yaṣṭavya,%} ‘to be
<div n="lb"/>offered’; {%of puroḍāś,%} ‘cake of sacrifice,’
<div n="lb"/>in verse 6, as a pun on {%purogās,%} ‘leader’).
<div n="lb"/>Whether Yakṣu is used contemptuously
<div n="lb"/>for Yadu or not, it seems hard not to
<div n="lb"/>believe that the Yadus are referred
<div n="lb"/>to.</F>
