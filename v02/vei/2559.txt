{@Yadu@}¦ is the name of a tribe and of the king of the tribe.
<div n="lb"/>They are mentioned repeatedly in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> normally in
<div n="lb"/>conjunction with {@Turvaśa.@} They seem to have taken part in
<div n="lb"/>the great battle against {@Sudās:@}<sup>2</sup> the Yadu and the Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>kings seem to have escaped with their lives, while the {@Anu@} and
<div n="lb"/>the {@Druhyu@} kings perished. This is at least the most natural
<div n="lb"/>explanation of several passages,<sup>3</sup> though these passages possibly
<div n="lb"/>refer to a successful raid across the {@Sarayu,@} and a defeat of two
<div n="lb"/>princes, Arṇa and Citraratha.<sup>4</sup> That Turvaśa was the Yadu
<div n="lb"/>king, as Hopkins<sup>5</sup> holds, is most improbable.
