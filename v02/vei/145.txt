{@Arya.@}¦ — This word is not common in the older literature, in
places where the quantity of the first vowel is fixed as short, except
in a mere adjectival sense. Geldner,<sup>1</sup> indeed, contends that no
other sense is anywhere needed; but Roth<sup>2</sup> and Zimmer<sup>3</sup> agree
in thinking that in several passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup>
the word has the same sense as {@Ārya,@} and this appears probable.
Whether it is necessary to ascribe this sense to the word in the
compound {%arya-patnī%}<sup>5</sup> applied to the waters set free by Indra,
is more doubtful. The commentator, Mahīdhara,<sup>6</sup> suggests
that the word means a {@Vaiśya,@} not an {@Ārya@} generally. This
view is supported by the explanation in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
of one of the passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>8</sup> But though
the use of Arya to denote a Vaiśya became common later, it is
not clear that it was original.
