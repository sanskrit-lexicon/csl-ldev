{@Yājña-valkya,@}¦ ‘descendant of Yajñavalkya,’ is repeatedly
mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> as an authority on
questions of ritual. He is, however, also given as an authority
on questions of philosophy in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>2</sup>
but Oldenberg<sup>3</sup> is, no doubt, right in thinking that no possible
importance can be attached to the mention of Yājñavalkya in
the latter capacity. He is said to have been a pupil of
{@Uddālaka Āruṇi,@}<sup>4</sup> whom he opposed successfully in a dispute.<sup>5</sup>
His two wives, {@Maitreyī@} and {@Kātyāyanī,@} are mentioned in the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>6</sup> which concludes<sup>7</sup> with a passage
ascribing to Yājñavalkya Vājasaneya the ‘white Yajus’ ({%śuklāni%}
{%yajūṃṣi%}). It is remarkable that Yājñavalkya is never mentioned
in any other Vedic text outside the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
except the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,<sup>8</sup> where, however, both
reference are merely transcripts from the Śatapatha.<sup>9</sup> It has
[Page2-190+ 50]
been supposed by Oldenberg<sup>10</sup> and others that Yājñavalkya
belonged to {@Videha,@} but despite the legend of Janaka's patronage
of him, his association with {@Uddālaka,@} the {@Kuru-Pañcāla,@}
renders this doubtful.
