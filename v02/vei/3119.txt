{@Vrātya@}¦ is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>1</sup> where, however, no
further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information
is furnished by the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup>
and the Sūtras.<sup>4</sup> which describe at length a certain rite intended
for the use of Vrātyas. According to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa, there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’ — viz., the
{%hīna,%} who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have
become outcasts for some sin ({%nindita%}); those who become out-
casts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and
those old men who, being impotent ({%śama-nīcameḍhra%}), have
gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no
means of the same importance as the first. The motive of
the fourth is hard to understand: according to Rājārām Rām-
[Page2-343+ 41]
krishṇa Bhāgavat,<sup>5</sup> they were men who had enfeebled their
constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of
the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But
this is not stated in the text.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the really important Vrātyas were
those referred to as {%hīna,%} and that the other classes were only
subsidiary. According to Rājārām,<sup>6</sup> there were two categories
of the first class: ({%a%}) The depressed ({%hīna%}), who were non-
Āryan; and ({%b%}) degraded Āryans ({%gara-gir%}). This, however, is
a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have
been but one class of Vrātyas. That they were non-Āryan is
not probable, for it is expressly said<sup>7</sup> that, though unconse-
crated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were
thus apparently Āryans. This view is confirmed by the state-
ment that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to
utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of
speech ({%cf.%} {@Vāc@}). The Sūtras mention their Arhants (‘saints’)
and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical
Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya.
<div n="P"/>Other particulars accord with the view that they were
Āryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they
are said<sup>8</sup> not to practise agriculture or commerce (an
allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of
{@Brahmacarya@} — {%i.e.,%} the principle regulating the Brahminic
order of life. They were also allowed to become members
of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual
prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case
of non-Āryans.
<div n="P"/>Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vrātyas.
Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they
beat those unworthy of correction.<sup>9</sup> Their leder (Gṛhapati) or
householder wore a turban ({@Uṣṇīṣa@}), carried a whip ({@Pratoda@}),
a kind of bow ({@Jyāhroḍa@}), was clothed in a black ({%kṛṣṇaśa%})
garment and two skins ({@Ajina@}), black and white ({%kṛṣṇa-valakṣa%}),
and owned a rough wagon ({@Vipatha@}) covered with planks
[Page2-344+ 51]
({%phalakāstīrṇa%}). The others,<sup>10</sup> subordinate to the leader, had
garments with fringes of red ({%valūkāntāni dāmatūṣāṇi%}), two
fringes on each, skins folded double ({%dviṣaṃhitāny ajināni%}), and
sandals ({@Upānah@}). The leader wore also an ornament ({@Niṣka@})
of silver, which Rājārām<sup>11</sup> converts into a silver coinage. The
Vrātyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over
their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the
Sūtras ({%e.g.,%} that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black
hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The locality in which the Vrātyas lived cannot be stated with
certainty, but their nomad life<sup>12</sup> suggests the western tribes
beyond the Sarasvatī. But they may equally well have been in
the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the
Sūtras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vrātya's
outfit an inhabitant of {@Magadha.@} The Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> does not
help, for it treats the Vrātya in so mystical a way that he is
represented as being in all the quarters. Indeed, Roth<sup>14</sup>
believed that it was here not a case of the Vrātya of the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa at all, but of a glorification of the Vrātya as
the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant
({@Parivrājaka@}). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence
of the words {%uṣṇīsa, vipatha,%} and {%pratoaa%} shows. It is probable
that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the
Vrātya, and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted
Vrātya as a type of the perfect {@Brahmicārin,@} and, in so far, of
the divinity.<sup>15</sup>
