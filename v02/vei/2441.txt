{@Mātariśvan@}¦ is mentioned in a Vālakhilya hymn of the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a sacrificer along with {@Medhya@} and {@Pṛṣadhra.@}
He seems to be mentioned also in one other passage, possibly
in two.<sup>2</sup> In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>3</sup> a patron, {@Pṛṣadhra@}
{@Medhya Mātariśvan@} or {@Mātariśva@} is created by a misunder-
standing of the Rigvedic text.
<F>1) Rv. viii. 52, 2.</F>
<F>2) Rv. x. 48, 2; 105, 6. The former
reference is much more probable than
the latter.</F>
<F>3) xvi. 11, 26; Weber, {%Episches im%}
{%vedischen Ritual,%} 39, 40. The manu-
scripts vary between Mātariśvan and
Mātariśva.
