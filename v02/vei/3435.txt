{@Saciva@}¦ ‘companion,’ ‘attendant’ (from {%sac,%} ‘follow’), later a
common word for the comrade of a king, his minister, is found
in Vedic literature in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 20, 1), where
it is used by Indra of the Maruts. It seems to correspond in
sense to the German {%comes%} or the English {%gesith.%}<sup>1</sup>
