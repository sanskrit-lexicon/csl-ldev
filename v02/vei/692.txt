{@Kṛmi,@}¦ ‘worm.’ In the later Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup> and especially in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> worms play a considerable part. They are
[Page1-180+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>regarded as poisonous, and are spoken of as found in the
<div n="lb"/>mountains, in forests, in waters, in plants, and in the human
<div n="lb"/>body. In accordance with widespread primitive ideas, they
<div n="lb"/>are considered to be the causes of disease in men and animals.
<div n="lb"/>The Atharvaveda contains three hymns<sup>2</sup> as charms directed
<div n="lb"/>against them. The first of these hymns is of a general character,
<div n="lb"/>the second is meant to destroy worms in cattle, and the third is
<div n="lb"/>intended to cure children of worms. When found in men,
<div n="lb"/>worms are said to have their place in the head and ribs,<sup>3</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>to creep into the eyes, nose, and teeth.<sup>4</sup> They are described as
<div n="lb"/>dark brown, but white in the fore part of the body, with black
<div n="lb"/>ears, and as having three heads.<sup>5</sup> They are given many specific
<div n="lb"/>names: {@Alāṇḍu, Ejatka, Kaṣkaṣa, Kīṭa, Kurūru, Nīlaṅgu,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Yevāṣa, Vaghā, Vṛkṣasarpī, Śaluna, Śavarta, Śipavitnuka,@}
