{@Kṛmi,@}¦ ‘worm.’ In the later Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup> and especially in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> worms play a considerable part. They are
[Page1-180+ 47]
regarded as poisonous, and are spoken of as found in the
mountains, in forests, in waters, in plants, and in the human
body. In accordance with widespread primitive ideas, they
are considered to be the causes of disease in men and animals.
The Atharvaveda contains three hymns<sup>2</sup> as charms directed
against them. The first of these hymns is of a general character,
the second is meant to destroy worms in cattle, and the third is
intended to cure children of worms. When found in men,
worms are said to have their place in the head and ribs,<sup>3</sup> and
to creep into the eyes, nose, and teeth.<sup>4</sup> They are described as
dark brown, but white in the fore part of the body, with black
ears, and as having three heads.<sup>5</sup> They are given many specific
names: {@Alāṇḍu, Ejatka, Kaṣkaṣa, Kīṭa, Kurūru, Nīlaṅgu,@}
