{@Ajñāta-yakṣma,@}¦ the ‘unknown sickness,’ is mentioned in
the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>3</sup> It is
referred to in connection with Rājayakṣma. Grohmann<sup>4</sup> thinks
that the two are different forms of disease, hypertrophy and
atrophy, the purpose of the spell in the Rigveda being thus the
removal of all disease. From the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> he deduces its
identity with {@Balāsa.@} Zimmer,<sup>6</sup> however, points out that this
[Page1-014+ 42]
conclusion is unjustified, leaving the disease unidentified, which
seems to accord with its name.
