{@Brahma-carya@}¦ denotes the condition of life of the {@Brahma-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@cārin@}<sup>1</sup> or religious student. The technical sense is first found in
[Page2-075+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>the last Maṇḍala of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The practice of studentship
<div n="lb"/>doubtless developed, and was more strictly regulated by custom
<div n="lb"/>as time went on, but it is regularly assumed and discussed in
<div n="lb"/>the later Vedic literature, being obviously a necessary part of
<div n="lb"/>Vedic society
<div n="P"/>The Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> has in honour of the Brahmacārin a hymn
<div n="lb"/>which already gives all the characteristic features of religious
<div n="lb"/>studentship. The youth is initiated ({%upa-nī%}) by the teacher<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair
<div n="lb"/>grow long;<sup>5</sup> he collects fuel,<sup>6</sup> and begs,<sup>7</sup> learns, and practises
<div n="lb"/>penance. All these characteristics appear in the later literature.
<div n="lb"/>The student lives in the house of his teacher ({%ācārya-kula-vāsin;%}<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%ante-vāsin%});<sup>9</sup> he begs,<sup>10</sup> looks after the sacrificial fires,<sup>11</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>tends the house.<sup>12</sup> His term of studentship might be long
<div n="lb"/>extended: it was normally fixed at twelve years,<sup>13</sup> but much
<div n="lb"/>longer periods, such as thirty-two years, are mentioned.<sup>14</sup> The
[Page2-076+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>age at which studentship began varied.<sup>15</sup> {@Śvetaketu@} com-
<div n="lb"/>menced at twelve and studied for twelve years.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is assumed in the Gṛhya Sūtras that the three Āryan castes
<div n="lb"/>were all required to pass through a period of studentship. But
<div n="lb"/>that this is much more than priestly schematism is uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>No doubt individuals of the {@Kṣatriya@} or {@Vaiśya@} caste might go
<div n="lb"/>through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys
<div n="lb"/>of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students.
<div n="lb"/>This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda<sup>17</sup> to the
<div n="lb"/>king guarding his country by Brahmacarya — though that is
<div n="lb"/>susceptible of a different interpretation — and more clearly by
<div n="lb"/>the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>18</sup> to a rite intended to
<div n="lb"/>benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied ({%vidyām%}
<div n="lb"/>{%anūcya%}), but had not gained renown, and by references in the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads to kings who like {@Janaka@} studied the Vedas and the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads.<sup>19</sup> Normally, however, the Kṣatriya studied the art
<div n="lb"/>of war.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of the duties of the Brahmacārin was chastity. But
<div n="lb"/>reference is in several places<sup>21</sup> made to the possibility of mis-
<div n="lb"/>conduct between a student and the wife of his preceptor, nor is
<div n="lb"/>any very severe penance imposed in early times — later it is
<div n="lb"/>different — for such a sin. In certain cases the ritual required
<div n="lb"/>a breach of chastity, no doubt as a magic spell to secure
<div n="lb"/>fertility.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Even an old man might on occasion become a pupil, as the
<div n="lb"/>story of {@Āruṇi@} shows.<sup>23</sup>

<div n="lb"/>The Sūtras allowed for a Brāhmaṇa the
<div n="lb"/>ages 8-16; for a Kṣatriya, 11-22; for a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya, 12-24. The difference between
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, com-
<div n="lb"/>pared with that between the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>and the Vaiśya, shows that the two
<div n="lb"/>latter castes were in a different position
