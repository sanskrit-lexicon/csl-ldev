{@Brahma-carya@}¦ denotes the condition of life of the {@Brahma-@}
{@cārin@}<sup>1</sup> or religious student. The technical sense is first found in
[Page2-075+ 70]
the last Maṇḍala of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The practice of studentship
doubtless developed, and was more strictly regulated by custom
as time went on, but it is regularly assumed and discussed in
the later Vedic literature, being obviously a necessary part of
Vedic society
<div n="P"/>The Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> has in honour of the Brahmacārin a hymn
which already gives all the characteristic features of religious
studentship. The youth is initiated ({%upa-nī%}) by the teacher<sup>4</sup>
into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair
grow long;<sup>5</sup> he collects fuel,<sup>6</sup> and begs,<sup>7</sup> learns, and practises
penance. All these characteristics appear in the later literature.
The student lives in the house of his teacher ({%ācārya-kula-vāsin;%}<sup>8</sup>
{%ante-vāsin%});<sup>9</sup> he begs,<sup>10</sup> looks after the sacrificial fires,<sup>11</sup> and
tends the house.<sup>12</sup> His term of studentship might be long
extended: it was normally fixed at twelve years,<sup>13</sup> but much
longer periods, such as thirty-two years, are mentioned.<sup>14</sup> The
[Page2-076+ 56]
age at which studentship began varied.<sup>15</sup> {@Śvetaketu@} com-
menced at twelve and studied for twelve years.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is assumed in the Gṛhya Sūtras that the three Āryan castes
were all required to pass through a period of studentship. But
that this is much more than priestly schematism is uncertain.
No doubt individuals of the {@Kṣatriya@} or {@Vaiśya@} caste might go
through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys
of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students.
This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda<sup>17</sup> to the
king guarding his country by Brahmacarya — though that is
susceptible of a different interpretation — and more clearly by
the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>18</sup> to a rite intended to
benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied ({%vidyām%}
{%anūcya%}), but had not gained renown, and by references in the
Upaniṣads to kings who like {@Janaka@} studied the Vedas and the
Upaniṣads.<sup>19</sup> Normally, however, the Kṣatriya studied the art
of war.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of the duties of the Brahmacārin was chastity. But
reference is in several places<sup>21</sup> made to the possibility of mis-
conduct between a student and the wife of his preceptor, nor is
any very severe penance imposed in early times — later it is
different — for such a sin. In certain cases the ritual required
a breach of chastity, no doubt as a magic spell to secure
fertility.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Even an old man might on occasion become a pupil, as the
story of {@Āruṇi@} shows.<sup>23</sup>

A Mantra in the Āśvalāyana Gṛhya
Sūtra, i. 22, 1. 2, and elsewhere, sums
up the duties of the Brahmacārin as
‘thou art a Brahmacārin: eat water;
perform thy duty; sleep not in the
daytime; obedient to thy teacher study
the Veda ({%brahmacāry asy; apo ‘śāna;%}
{%karma kuru; divā mā svāpsīr; ācāry-%}
{%āyādhīno vedam adhīṣva%}).’ One duty
specially referred to in the Aitareya
Āraṇyaka, iii. 1, 6; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇ-
yaka, vii. 19, and the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad, iv. 5, 5, was the guarding
of the teacher's cattle when they were
grazing on their pasture grounds. From
these grounds, too, the pupil would,
no doubt, bring dried dung for fuel, as
well as any available sticks. As regards
obedience to the teacher, {%cf.%} Śatapatha

The Sūtras allowed for a Brāhmaṇa the
ages 8-16; for a Kṣatriya, 11-22; for a
Vaiśya, 12-24. The difference between
the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, com-
pared with that between the Kṣatriya
and the Vaiśya, shows that the two
latter castes were in a different position
from the Brāhmaṇa.</F>
