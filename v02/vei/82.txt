{@Apa-cit.@}¦ — This word occurs several times in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup>
It is held by Roth,<sup>2</sup> Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> and others to denote an insect
whose sting produced swellings, etc. ({%glau%}). But Bloomfield<sup>4</sup>
shows that the disease, scrofulous swellings, is what is really
meant, as is shown by the rendering ({%gaṇḍa-mālā,%} ‘inflammation
of the glands of the neck’) of Keśava and Sāyaṇa, and by the
parallelism of the later disease, {%apacī,%} the derivation being from
{%apa%} and {%ci,%} ‘to pick off.’
