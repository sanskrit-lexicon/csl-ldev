{@Vāc,@}¦ ‘speech,’ plays a great part in Vedic speculation, but
only a few points are of other than mythological significance.
Speech is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> divided into four kinds
-that of men, of animals, of birds ({%vayāṃsi%}), and of small
creeping things ({%kṣudraṃ sarīsṛpam%}). The discrimination or
making articulate of speech is ascribed to Indra by the
Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> The ‘speech’ of the following musical instruments
-{@Tūṇava, Vīṇā, Dundubhi@}<sup>3</sup> — is mentioned, and in one
Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> also that of the axle of a chariot. The speech of the
{@Kuru-Pañcālas@} was especially renowned,<sup>5</sup> as well as that of the
northern country, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> so
that men went there to study the language. On the other hand,
barbarisms in speech were known, and were to be avoided.<sup>7</sup>
[Page2-280+ 55]
<div n="P"/>One division of speech referred to<sup>8</sup> is that of the divine
({%daivī%}) and the human ({%mānuṣī%}), of which some specimens are
given, such as {%om,%} the divine counterpart of {%tathā,%} and so forth.
The Brahmin is said to know both;<sup>9</sup> it seems best to regard
the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhraṃśa, as
Sāyaṇa<sup>10</sup> suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual
and the hymns and that of ordinary life.
<div n="P"/>Reference is also made to Āryan<sup>11</sup> and to Brahmin<sup>12</sup> speech,
by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-Āryan tongues, seems to
be meant. The {@Vrātyas@} are described as speaking the language
of the initiated ({%dīkṣita-vāc%}), though not themselves initiated
({%a-dīkṣita%}), but as calling that which is easy to utter ({%a-durukta%}),
difficult to utter.<sup>13</sup> This may mean that the non-Brahminical
Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical
tribes to Prākrit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect
the Vrātyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup>

The difficult phrase has caused some
doubt as to the sense, for {%uttarāhi vāg%}
{%vadati Kurupañcālatrā%} seems to mean
‘speech in the north among the Kuru-
Pañcālas,’ this version being slightly
supported by the Kāṇva recension of
the passage quoted by Eggeling, {%Sacred%}
{%Books of the East,%} 12, xlii. n. 1. That
recension, however, is not merely ob-
scure, but it seems to couple the Kurus
with the northern {@Mahāvṛṣas@} (so we
must emend {%Mahāviṣeṣu%}), and it cannot
be relied on. Eggeling's attempt to
remove the difficulty by taking {%uttarāhi%}
as ‘higher’ in tone is not satisfactory.
The most probable solution is that of
Weber, {%Indische Studien,%} 1, 191, who
takes {%Kurupañcālatrā%} to be ‘as among
the Kuru-Pañcālas,’ which gives a good
sense, especially when it is remembered
that the northerners were probably the
{@Uttara-Kurus@} in Kaśmīr, which seems
to have been a home of Sanskrit
