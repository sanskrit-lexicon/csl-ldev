{@Vāc,@}¦ ‘speech,’ plays a great part in Vedic speculation, but
<div n="lb"/>only a few points are of other than mythological significance.
<div n="lb"/>Speech is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> divided into four kinds
<div n="lb"/>-that of men, of animals, of birds ({%vayāṃsi%}), and of small
<div n="lb"/>creeping things ({%kṣudraṃ sarīsṛpam%}). The discrimination or
<div n="lb"/>making articulate of speech is ascribed to Indra by the
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> The ‘speech’ of the following musical instruments
<div n="lb"/>-{@Tūṇava, Vīṇā, Dundubhi@}<sup>3</sup> — is mentioned, and in one
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> also that of the axle of a chariot. The speech of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuru-Pañcālas@} was especially renowned,<sup>5</sup> as well as that of the
<div n="lb"/>northern country, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> so
<div n="lb"/>that men went there to study the language. On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>barbarisms in speech were known, and were to be avoided.<sup>7</sup>
[Page2-280+ 55]
<div n="P"/>One division of speech referred to<sup>8</sup> is that of the divine
<div n="lb"/>({%daivī%}) and the human ({%mānuṣī%}), of which some specimens are
<div n="lb"/>given, such as {%om,%} the divine counterpart of {%tathā,%} and so forth.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmin is said to know both;<sup>9</sup> it seems best to regard
<div n="lb"/>the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhraṃśa, as
<div n="lb"/>Sāyaṇa<sup>10</sup> suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual
<div n="lb"/>and the hymns and that of ordinary life.
<div n="P"/>Reference is also made to Āryan<sup>11</sup> and to Brahmin<sup>12</sup> speech,
<div n="lb"/>by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-Āryan tongues, seems to
<div n="lb"/>be meant. The {@Vrātyas@} are described as speaking the language
<div n="lb"/>of the initiated ({%dīkṣita-vāc%}), though not themselves initiated
<div n="lb"/>({%a-dīkṣita%}), but as calling that which is easy to utter ({%a-durukta%}),
<div n="lb"/>difficult to utter.<sup>13</sup> This may mean that the non-Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>tribes to Prākrit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect
<div n="lb"/>the Vrātyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup>

<div n="lb"/>The difficult phrase has caused some
<div n="lb"/>doubt as to the sense, for {%uttarāhi vāg%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vadati Kurupañcālatrā%} seems to mean
<div n="lb"/>‘speech in the north among the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas,’ this version being slightly
<div n="lb"/>supported by the Kāṇva recension of
<div n="lb"/>the passage quoted by Eggeling, {%Sacred%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Books of the East,%} 12, xlii. n. 1. That
<div n="lb"/>recension, however, is not merely ob-
<div n="lb"/>scure, but it seems to couple the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>with the northern {@Mahāvṛṣas@} (so we
<div n="lb"/>must emend {%Mahāviṣeṣu%}), and it cannot
<div n="lb"/>be relied on. Eggeling's attempt to
<div n="lb"/>remove the difficulty by taking {%uttarāhi%}
<div n="lb"/>as ‘higher’ in tone is not satisfactory.
<div n="lb"/>The most probable solution is that of
<div n="lb"/>Weber, {%Indische Studien,%} 1, 191, who
<div n="lb"/>takes {%Kurupañcālatrā%} to be ‘as among
<div n="lb"/>the Kuru-Pañcālas,’ which gives a good
<div n="lb"/>sense, especially when it is remembered
<div n="lb"/>that the northerners were probably the
<div n="lb"/>{@Uttara-Kurus@} in Kaśmīr, which seems
<div n="lb"/>to have been a home of Sanskrit
