{@Śaṃ-tanu@}¦ is the hero of a tale told by Yāska,<sup>1</sup> and often
<div n="lb"/>found later.<sup>2</sup> He supersedes his elder brother {@Devāpi@} as king
<div n="lb"/>of the {@Kurus.@} When his improper deed brings on a prolonged
<div n="lb"/>drought in his realm, he is compelled to ask his brother to
<div n="lb"/>assume the kingship; Devāpi, however, refuses, but instead
<div n="lb"/>performs a sacrifice which produces rain. Sieg<sup>3</sup> endeavours to
<div n="lb"/>trace this story in the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> but all that is there stated is
<div n="lb"/>that Devāpi {@Ārṣṭiṣeṇa@} obtained (no doubt as priest) rain for
<div n="lb"/>Śaṃtanu (no doubt a king). There is no hint of relationship
<div n="lb"/>at all.
