{@Videha@}¦ is the name of a people who are not mentioned
before the Brāhmaṇa period. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup>
the legend of {@Videgha Māthava@} preserves clearly a tradition
that in Videha culture came from the Brahmins of the West,
and that {@Kosala@} was brahminized before Videha. The Videhas,
however, derived some fame later from the culture of their king
{@Janaka,@} who figures in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> as one of
the leading patrons of the Brahman doctrine. In the Kauṣītaki
Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> the Videhas are joined with the {@Kāśis;@} in the list of
peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> the Videhas are passed
over, probably because, with Kosala and Kāśi, they are included
in the term {@Prācyas,@} ‘easterners.’ Again, in the Śāṅkhāyana
Śrauta Sūtra<sup>5</sup> it is recorded that the Kāśi, Kosala, and Videha
kingdoms had each the one Purohita, {@Jala Jātūkarṇya;@} and
in another passage of the same text<sup>6</sup> the connexion between
the Videha king, {@Para Āṭṇāra,@} and the Kosala king, {@Hiraṇya-@}
{@nābha,@} is explained, while the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> speaks of
Para Āṭṇāra as the Kosala king, descendant of Hiraṇyanābha.
<div n="P"/>Another king of Videha was {@Namī Sāpya,@} mentioned in the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup> In the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda<sup>9</sup>
‘cows of Videha’ seem to be alluded to, though the com-
mentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā merely takes the adjective
{%vaidehī%} as ‘having a splendid body’ ({%viśiṣṭa-deha-sambandhinī%}),
and the point of a place name in the expression is not very
obvious. The Videhas also occur in the Baudhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>10</sup> in Brāhmaṇa-like passages.
<div n="P"/>The boundary of Kosala and Videha was the {@Sadānīrā,@}
[Page2-299+ 52]
probably the modern Gandak<sup>11</sup> (the Kondochates of the Greek
geographers), which, rising in Nepal, flows into the Ganges
opposite Patna. Videha itself corresponds roughly to the
modern Tirhut.
