{@Kṛśa@}¦ is mentioned with {@Saṃvarta@} as a pious sacrificer to
Indra in one of the Vālakhilya hymns of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and in
another<sup>2</sup> as a speaker of truth, while a third is traditionally<sup>3</sup>
ascribed to his authorship. He seems also to be mentioned
with {@Śayu@} as a protégé of the Aśvins in another hymn of the
Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> but here the word may merely denote the ‘feeble
man.’<sup>5</sup>
