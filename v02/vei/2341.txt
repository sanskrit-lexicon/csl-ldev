{@Madhya-deśa,@}¦ the ‘Middle Country,’ is, according to the
<div n="lb"/>Mānava Dharma Śāstra,<sup>1</sup> the land between the Himālaya in
<div n="lb"/>the north, the Vindhya in the south, {@Vinaśana@} in the west,
<div n="lb"/>and Prayāga (now Allahabad) in the east — that is, between the
<div n="lb"/>place where the {@Sarasvatī@} disappears in the desert, and the
<div n="lb"/>point of the confluence of the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna) and the {@Gaṅgā@}
<div n="lb"/>(Ganges). The same authority<sup>2</sup> defines Brahmarṣi-deśa as
<div n="lb"/>denoting the land of {@Kurukṣetra,@} the {@Matsyas, Pañcālas,@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Śūrasenakas,@} and Brahmāvarta<sup>3</sup> as meaning the particularly
<div n="lb"/>holy land between the Sarasvatī and the {@Dṛṣadvatī.@} The
<div n="lb"/>Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra<sup>4</sup> defines Āryāvarta as the land east
<div n="lb"/>of Vinaśana; west of the Kālaka-vana, ‘Black Forest,’ or rather
<div n="lb"/>Kanakhala, near Hardvār; south of the Himālaya; and north
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāriyātra or the Pāripātra Mountains; adding that, in
<div n="lb"/>the opinion of others,<sup>5</sup> it was confined to the country between
<div n="lb"/>the Yamunā and the Gaṅgā, while the {@Bhāllavins@}<sup>6</sup> took it as
<div n="lb"/>the country between the boundary-river (or perhaps the Saras-
[Page2-126+ 84]
<div n="lb"/>vatī)<sup>7</sup> and the region where the sun rises. The Mānava
<div n="lb"/>Dharma Śāstra,<sup>8</sup> in accord with the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>defines Āryāvarta as the region between the Vindhya and the
<div n="lb"/>Himālaya, the two ranges which seem to be the boundaries of
<div n="lb"/>the Āryan world in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad also.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>The term Madhyadeśa is not Vedic, but it is represented in
<div n="lb"/>the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> by the expression {%madhyamā pratiṣṭhā%}
<div n="lb"/>{%diś,%} ‘the middle fixed region,’ the inhabitants of which are
<div n="lb"/>stated to be the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the {@Vaśas,@} and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Uśīnaras.@} The latter two peoples practically disappear later
<div n="lb"/>on, the Madhyadeśa being the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas,
<div n="lb"/>the land where the Brāhmaṇas and the later Saṃhitās were
<div n="lb"/>produced, bounded on the east by the {@Kosala-Videhas,@} and on
<div n="lb"/>the west by the desert. The western tribes are mentioned with
<div n="lb"/>disapproval both in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> and the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> while the tradition of the Brahminization of the
<div n="lb"/>Kosalas and the Videhas from the Kuru-Pañcāla country is
<div n="lb"/>preserved in the former Brāhmaṇa.<sup>14</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī; the former may, but not
<div n="lb"/>necessarily. Conceivably the Sindhu
<div n="lb"/>(Indus) is meant; for it was a great
<div n="lb"/>boundary, with Āryan tribes to the east
<div n="lb"/>of it.</F>

<div n="lb"/>the Vindhya range in Mālvā, and who
<div n="lb"/>suggests that the western boundary was
<div n="lb"/>originally the Ādarśa Mountains; for
<div n="lb"/>the reading of the manuscripts, and
<div n="lb"/>of the scholiast Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, in the
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, i. 8, is {%prāg%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ādarśanāt,%} not {%adarśanāt%} (corresponding
<div n="lb"/>with the Vinaśana of Baudhāyana
<div n="lb"/>Dharma Sūtra, i. 2, 9), and the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhāṣya on Pāṇini, ii. 4, 10, has {%prāg%}

<div n="lb"/>‘Middle Country’ an article by Rhys

<div n="lb"/>{%Sacred Books of the East,%} 32, 58, 59;
<div n="lb"/>{%Indian Empire,%} 1, 303, 304, where the
<div n="lb"/>extraordinary theory is adopted that
<div n="lb"/>the Madhyadeśa was peopled by a new
<div n="lb"/>race of immigrant Āryans, who, travel-
<div n="lb"/>ling viâ Chitral and Gilgit, and bringing
<div n="lb"/>no women with them, married Dravidian
<div n="lb"/>women, and produced the so-called
<div n="lb"/>Āryo-Dravidians. It is quite impossible
<div n="lb"/>to find any support for this theory in
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature. To say, as is there
<div n="lb"/>said, that the ‘Vedic hymns contain
<div n="lb"/>no reference to the route by which the
<div n="lb"/>Āryans entered India or to their earlier
<div n="lb"/>settlements on the Indus,’ and that this
<div n="lb"/>is explained by the theory of the entry
<div n="lb"/>of the Vedic Indians viâ Chitral, is to
<div n="lb"/>assert absurdities. The theory is based
<div n="lb"/>on the later dialects and their affinities
<div n="lb"/>(see Grierson, {%Indian Empire,%} 1, 357
<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%}); it can probably not be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as at all valid for any period — at any
<div n="lb"/>rate, it is not cogent for the eighth
<div n="lb"/>century, B.C.</F>
