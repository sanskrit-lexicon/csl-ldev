1. {@Tānva@}¦ in an obscure passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> seems to
mean a ‘legitimate son,’ who is said not to leave the heritage
({%riktha%}) of his father to his sister ({%jāmi%}). The exact meaning
is probably unascertainable,<sup>2</sup> but the passage may convey a
statement of what was no doubt the fact, that the daughter
had no share in the paternal inheritance; her brother had to
provide for her during her life if she remained unmarried, but
she had no independent portion.<sup>3</sup> (See {@Dāya.@})
