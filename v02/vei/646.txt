{@Kuru-kṣetra@}¦ (‘land of the Kurus’) is always regarded in the
Brāhmaṇa texts<sup>1</sup> as a particularly sacred country. Within its
boundaries flowed the rivers {@Dṛṣadvatī@} and {@Sarasvatī,@} as well
as the {@Āpayā.@}<sup>2</sup> Here, too, was situated {@Śaryaṇāvant,@}<sup>3</sup> which
[Page1-170+ 46]
appears to have been a lake, like that known to the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa by the name of {@Anyataḥ-plakṣā.@}<sup>4</sup> According to
Pischel, there was also in Kurukṣetra a stream called {@Pastyā,@}<sup>5</sup>
which he sees in certain passages of the Rigveda. The boun-
daries of Kurukṣetra are given in a passage of the Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka<sup>6</sup> as being Khāṇḍava on the south, the Tūrghna on
the north, and the Parīṇah on the west. Roughly speaking, it
corresponded to the modern Sirhind.
