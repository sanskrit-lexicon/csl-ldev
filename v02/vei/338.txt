{@Uttara Kuru.@}¦ — The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part
<div n="lb"/>in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in
<div n="lb"/>the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where they are located beyond the
<div n="lb"/>Himālaya ({%pareṇa Himavantam%}). In another passage,<sup>2</sup> how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by {@Vāsiṣṭha@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Sātyahavya@} to be a land of the gods ({%deva-kṣetra%}), but {@Jānaṃ-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@tapi Atyarāti@} was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not
<div n="lb"/>wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view
<div n="lb"/>that the northern Kurus were settled in Kaśmīr, especially as
<div n="lb"/>{@Kurukṣetra@} is the region where tribes advancing from Kaśmīr
<div n="lb"/>might naturally be found. {%Cf.%} {@Udīcyas.@}
