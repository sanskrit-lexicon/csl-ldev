{@Uttara Kuru.@}¦ — The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part
in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where they are located beyond the
Himālaya ({%pareṇa Himavantam%}). In another passage,<sup>2</sup> how-
ever, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by {@Vāsiṣṭha@}
{@Sātyahavya@} to be a land of the gods ({%deva-kṣetra%}), but {@Jānaṃ-@}
{@tapi Atyarāti@} was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not
wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view
that the northern Kurus were settled in Kaśmīr, especially as
{@Kurukṣetra@} is the region where tribes advancing from Kaśmīr
might naturally be found. {%Cf.%} {@Udīcyas.@}
