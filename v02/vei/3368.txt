{@Śyāvāśva@}¦ is the name of a man mentioned several times in
the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> The Anukramaṇī (Index) assigns to him a
series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books.<sup>2</sup> In one
of the hymns<sup>3</sup> Śyāvāśva mentions, apparently as his patrons,
{@Taranta@} (a son of {@Vidadaśva@}) and {@Purumīlha,@} as well as
{@Rathavīti.@} On this hymn is based a legend found in the
Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> that he was the son of {@Arcanānas,@} who was
sacrificing for Rathavīti Dālbhya. The father was anxious to
obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though
the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being
a Ṛṣi. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home,
when they met on the way Taranta and Purumīḍha, former
patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while
Taranta's wife, Śaśīyasī, presented Śyāvāśva with much wealth.
The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the
forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result
the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to Śyāvāśva.
Sieg<sup>5</sup> seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda;
but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the
Rigveda are very obscure, and Śaśīyasī is probably no more
than an epithet.<sup>6</sup> That there is some Itihāsa at the back of the
hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined.
<div n="P"/>Śyāvāśva's obtaining gifts from Vaidadaśvi is referred to also
in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.<sup>7</sup> His name occurs in the
Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> in two lists of persons, of which the former
includes Purumīḍha, the latter also Arcanānas and Atri. A
Sāman is ascribed to him in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>9</sup> and
he is perhaps referred to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> In the
[Page2-401+ 58]
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> he
is styled Ārcanānasa, ‘son of Arcanānas,’ and later<sup>12</sup> he is called
Ātreya, ‘descendant of Atri.’
