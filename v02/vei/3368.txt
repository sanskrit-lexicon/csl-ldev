{@Śyāvāśva@}¦ is the name of a man mentioned several times in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> The Anukramaṇī (Index) assigns to him a
<div n="lb"/>series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books.<sup>2</sup> In one
<div n="lb"/>of the hymns<sup>3</sup> Śyāvāśva mentions, apparently as his patrons,
<div n="lb"/>{@Taranta@} (a son of {@Vidadaśva@}) and {@Purumīlha,@} as well as
<div n="lb"/>{@Rathavīti.@} On this hymn is based a legend found in the
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> that he was the son of {@Arcanānas,@} who was
<div n="lb"/>sacrificing for Rathavīti Dālbhya. The father was anxious to
<div n="lb"/>obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though
<div n="lb"/>the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being
<div n="lb"/>a Ṛṣi. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home,
<div n="lb"/>when they met on the way Taranta and Purumīḍha, former
<div n="lb"/>patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while
<div n="lb"/>Taranta's wife, Śaśīyasī, presented Śyāvāśva with much wealth.
<div n="lb"/>The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the
<div n="lb"/>forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result
<div n="lb"/>the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to Śyāvāśva.
<div n="lb"/>Sieg<sup>5</sup> seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda;
<div n="lb"/>but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda are very obscure, and Śaśīyasī is probably no more
<div n="lb"/>than an epithet.<sup>6</sup> That there is some Itihāsa at the back of the
<div n="lb"/>hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined.
<div n="P"/>Śyāvāśva's obtaining gifts from Vaidadaśvi is referred to also
<div n="lb"/>in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.<sup>7</sup> His name occurs in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> in two lists of persons, of which the former
<div n="lb"/>includes Purumīḍha, the latter also Arcanānas and Atri. A
<div n="lb"/>Sāman is ascribed to him in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>9</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>he is perhaps referred to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> In the
[Page2-401+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> he
<div n="lb"/>is styled Ārcanānasa, ‘son of Arcanānas,’ and later<sup>12</sup> he is called
<div n="lb"/>Ātreya, ‘descendant of Atri.’
