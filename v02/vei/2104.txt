3. {@Plakṣa Prā-sravaṇa@}¦ is the name of a locality, forty-four
days’ journey from the spot where the {@Sarasvatī@} disappears.
It is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> In the latter text it is said
that the middle of the earth is only a span ({@Prādeśa@}) to the
north of it. In the Rigveda Sūtras<sup>3</sup> the locality is called
Plākṣa Prasravaṇa, and is apparently meant to designate the
source of the Sarasvatī rather than the place of its reappearance.
