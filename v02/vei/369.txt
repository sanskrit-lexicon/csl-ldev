{@Upa-mit@}¦ occurs twice in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and once in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> as the designation of some part of a house. The
passages in the Rigveda leave little doubt that the word means
an upright pillar. As it is, in the Atharvaveda, coupled with
{@Parimit@} and {@Pratimit,@} the conclusion is natural that the latter
word denotes the beams supporting the Upamit, presumably by
leaning against it at an angle, while {@Parimit@} denotes the beams
connecting the Upamits horizontally. These interpretations,
however, can only be conjectural. See also {@Gṛha.@}
