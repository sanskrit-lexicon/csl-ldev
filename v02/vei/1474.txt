{@Nakṣatra@}¦ is a word of obscure origin and derivation. The
Indian interpreters already show a great divergence of opinion
as to its primary meaning. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> re-
solves it into {%na-kṣatra%} (‘no power’), explaining it by a legend.
The Nirukta<sup>2</sup> refers it to the root {%nakṣ,%} ‘obtain,’ following the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> Aufrecht<sup>4</sup> and Weber<sup>5</sup> derived it from
{%nakta-tra,%} ‘guardian of night,’ and more recently<sup>6</sup> the derivation
from {%nak-kṣatra,%} ‘having rule over night,’ seems to be gaining
acceptance. The generic meaning of the word therefore seems
to be ‘star.’
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras as Stars in the Rigveda and Later.%} — The sense
of ‘star’ appears to be adequate for all or nearly all the passages
in which Nakṣatra occurs in the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> The same sense
occurs in the later Saṃhitās also: the sun and the Nakṣatras are
mentioned together,<sup>8</sup> or the sun, the moon, and the Nakṣatras,<sup>9</sup>
or the moon and the Nakṣatras,<sup>10</sup> or the Nakṣatras alone;<sup>11</sup>
[Page1-410+ 55]
but there is no necessity to attribute to the word the sense of
‘lunar mansion’ in these passages.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, the names of at least three of the
Nakṣatras in the later sense occur in the Rigveda. Tiṣya,<sup>12</sup>
however, does not seem to be mentioned as a lunar mansion.
With {@Aghās@} (plur.) and {@Arjunī@} (dual)<sup>13</sup> the case is different:
it seems probable that they are the later lunar mansions called
Maghās (plur.) and Phalgunī (dual). The names appear to
have been deliberately changed in the Rigveda, and it must be
remembered that the hymn in which they occur, the wedding
hymn of Sūryā, has no claim to great age.<sup>14</sup> Ludwig<sup>15</sup> and
Zimmer<sup>16</sup> have seen other references to the Nakṣatras as
27 in the Rigveda,<sup>17</sup> but these seem most improbable. Nor
do the adjectives {%revatī%} (‘rich’) and {%punarvasā%} (‘bringing
wealth again’) in another hymn<sup>18</sup> appear to refer to the
Nakṣatras.
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras as Lunar Mansions.%} — In several passages of the
later Saṃhitās the connexion of the moon and the Nakṣatras
is conceived of as a marriage union. Thus in the Kāṭhaka<sup>19</sup>
and Taittirīya Saṃhitās<sup>20</sup> it is expressly stated that Soma was
wedded to the mansions, but dwelt only with Rohiṇī; the
others being angry, he had ultimately to undertake to live with
them all equally. Weber<sup>21</sup> hence deduced that the Nakṣatras
were regarded as of equal extent, but this is to press the texts
unduly, except in the sense of approximate equality. The
number of the mansions is not stated as 27 in the story told in
the two Saṃhitās: the Taittīriya has 33, and the Kāṭhaka no
[Page1-411+ 56]
number; but 27 appears as their number in the list which is
found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>22</sup> and elsewhere.<sup>23</sup> The
number 28 is much less well attested: in one passage of the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>24</sup> Abhijit is practically marked as a new
comer, though in a later book,<sup>25</sup> in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>26</sup>
and in the Atharvaveda list,<sup>27</sup> it has found acceptance. It is
perfectly possible that 28 is the earlier number, and that Abhijit
dropped out because it was faint, or too far north, or because
27 was a more mystic (3×3×3) number: it is significant that
the Chinese Sieou and the Arabic Manāzil are 28 in number.<sup>28</sup>
Weber,<sup>29</sup> however, believes that 27 is the older number in
India.
<div n="P"/>The meaning of the number is easily explained when it is
remembered that a periodic month occupies something between
27 and 28 days, more nearly the former number. Such a month
is in fact recognized in the Lāṭyāyana<sup>30</sup> and Nidāna Sūtras<sup>31</sup>
as consisting of 27 days, 12 months making a year of 324 days,
a Nakṣatra year, or with an intercalary month, a year of
351 days. The Nidāna Sūtra<sup>32</sup> makes an attempt to introduce
the Nakṣatra reckoning into the civil or solar ({%sāvana%}) year
of 360 days, for it holds that the sun spends 13(1/3) days in
each Nakṣatra (13(1/3)×27 = 360). But the month of 27 or
28 days plays no part in the chronological calculations of the
Veda.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The Names of the Nakṣatras.%} — In addition to the two men-
tioned in the Rigveda, the earlier Atharvaveda<sup>34</sup> gives the
[Page1-412+ 61]
names of Jyeṣṭhaghnī<sup>35</sup> (the later Jyeṣṭhā) and Vicṛtau,<sup>36</sup> which
are mentioned as in close connexion, and of Revatīs (plural)
and Kṛttikās.<sup>37</sup> With reference to possible times for the
ceremony of the Agnyādhāna, or ‘laying of the sacred fires,’
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>38</sup> the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>39</sup> and the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>40</sup> mention the Nakṣatras called Kṛttikās,
Rohiṇī, Phalgunyas, Hasta; the latter Brāhmaṇa adds Punar-
vasū, and in an additional remark<sup>41</sup> excludes Pūrve Phalgunī
in favour of Uttare Phalgunī. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>42</sup>
adds Mṛgaśīrṣa and Citrā as possibilities. On the other hand,
Punarvasū is recommended by all authorities<sup>43</sup> as suitable for
the Punarādheya, ‘relaying of the sacred fires,’ which takes
place if the first fire has failed to effect the aim of its existence,
the prosperity of the sacrificer.<sup>44</sup> The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>45</sup>
however, allows Anurādhās also.
<div n="P"/>In the ceremony of the Agnicayana, or ‘piling of the fire-
altar,’ the bricks are assumed to be equal in number to the
Nakṣatras. The bricks number 756, and they are equated to
27 Nakṣatras multiplied by 27 secondary Nakṣatras, reckoned
as 720 (instead of 729), with the addition of 36 days, the length
of an intercalary month. Nothing can be usefully derived
from this piece of priestly nonsense.<sup>46</sup> But in connexion with
this ceremony the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>47</sup> enumerate the 27
[Page1-413+ 50]
Nakṣatras, and these lists<sup>48</sup> may be given {%in extenso%} as

<div n="P"/>The Taittirīya Brahmaṇa<sup>49</sup> has a list of the Nakṣatras
which agrees generally with the list of the Saṃhitās. It runs
as follows: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Invakās, Bāhū (dual), Tiṣya,
Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrve Phalgunī, Uttare Phalgunī, Hasta,
Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe, Anūrādhās, Rohiṇī, Mūlabarhaṇī,
Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās, Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Śroṇā, Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj,
Pūrve Proṣṭhapadās, Uttare Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī, Aśvayujau,
Apabharaṇīs. In a later book,<sup>50</sup> however, the list grows to 28,
[Page1-414+ 50]
and the full moon is inserted after number 14, and the new
moon after number 28, as an attempt to bring the Nākṣatra
(lunar) month into accordance with the Sāvana (solar) month
of 30 days. The names in this second list are as in the
Saṃhitās with the following exceptions. The seven stars of
the Kṛttikās are named as Ambā, Dulā, Nitatnī, Abhrayantī,
Meghayantī, Varṣayantī, Cupuṇīkā, names found also in the
Taittirīya<sup>51</sup> and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās.<sup>52</sup> Beside Mṛgaśīrṣa, Invakās
are also mentioned.<sup>53</sup> Then come Ārdrā, Punarvasū, Tiṣya,
Āśreṣās, Maghās (beside which Anaghās, Agadās, and Arun-
dhatīs are also mentioned), Phalgunyas (but elsewhere in the
dual, Phalgunyau),<sup>54</sup> Phalgunyas, Hasta, Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe,
Anūrādhās, Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla, Aṣāḍhās, Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śronā,
Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, Proṣṭhapadās, Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī,
Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas, but also Apabharaṇīs.<sup>55</sup> Abhijit, which
occurs also in an earlier part of the Brāhmaṇa,<sup>56</sup> is perhaps
interpolated. But Weber's<sup>57</sup> argument that Abhijit is out of
place in this list because Brāhmaṇa is here mentioned as the
28th Nakṣatra, loses some force from the fact (of course unknown
to him) that the list in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>58</sup> contains
28 Nakṣatras, including Abhijit, and adds Brāhmaṇa at the end
as another.
<div n="P"/>In another passage<sup>59</sup> the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa divides the
Nakṣatras into two sets, the Deva Nakṣatras and the Yama
Nakṣatras, being 1-14 and 15-27 (with the omission of Abhijit)
respectively. This division corresponds with one in the third
book of the Brāhmaṇa<sup>60</sup> where the days of the light half of
the month and those of the dark half are equated with the
Nakṣatras. The Brāhmaṇa treats the former series as south,
the latter as north; but this has no relation to facts, and
can only be regarded as a ritual absurdity.
<div n="P"/>The late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda contains a
list<sup>61</sup> of the Nakṣatras, including Abhijit. The names here
[Page1-415+ 53]
given are: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasū,
Puṣya, Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrvā Phalgunyau ({%sic%}),<sup>62</sup> Hasta,
Citrā, Svāti (masc.),<sup>63</sup> Viśākhe, Anurādhā,<sup>64</sup> Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla,
Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās,<sup>65</sup> Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śravaṇa, Śraviṣṭhās,
Śatabhiṣaj, Dvayā Proṣṭhapadā, Revatī, Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas.
<div n="P"/>{%The Position of the Nakṣatras.%} — There is nothing definite in
Vedic literature regarding the position of most of the Nakṣatras,
but the later astronomy precisely locates all of them, and its
statements agree on the whole satisfactorily with what is said
in the earlier texts, though Weber<sup>66</sup> was inclined to doubt this.
The determinations adopted below are due to Whitney<sup>67</sup> in his
notes on the Sūrya Siddhānta.
