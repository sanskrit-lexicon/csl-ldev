{@Upama-śravas@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as
a son of {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} and grandson of {@Medhātithi.@} The
exact force of the reference to him in however, uncertain.
According to the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>2</sup> followed by Ludwig,<sup>3</sup> and by
Lanman,<sup>4</sup> the poet in the hymn consoles Upamaśravas for the
death of his grandfather, Medhātithi. Geldner,<sup>5</sup> on the other
hand, thinks that the poet, who was {@Kavaṣa Ailūṣa,@} was
ill-treated by his patron's son, Upamaśravas, and cast into
a ditch or well, where he uttered his complaint and appeal for
mercy. But of this there is no adequate evidence, and the
tradition of the Bṛhaddevatā seems sound.
