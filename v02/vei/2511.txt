2. {@Mṛga@}¦ in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> denotes, according to
<div n="lb"/>Sāyaṇa's commentary, the constellation {@Mṛgaśiras.@} But it
<div n="lb"/>seems more probable<sup>2</sup> that Mṛga there really covers the whole
<div n="lb"/>of Orion, not merely the inconspicuous group of stars in the
<div n="lb"/>head of Orion that make up the Nakṣatra Mṛgaśiras, but also
<div n="lb"/>the star <lang n="greek">α</lang> in his shoulder, which is reckoned as Ārdrā, and <lang n="greek">γ</lang>
<div n="lb"/>in his left shoulder. Tilak,<sup>3</sup> however, makes Mṛga or Mṛgaśiras
<div n="lb"/>into a different group, consisting of the belt of Orion, with two
<div n="lb"/>stars in the knees and one in the left shoulder, which he
<div n="lb"/>deems to resemble a deer's head with an arrow through it,
<div n="lb"/>an implausible and unlikely theory. {%Cf.%} {@Mṛgavyādha.@}
