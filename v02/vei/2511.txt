2. {@Mṛga@}¦ in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> denotes, according to
Sāyaṇa's commentary, the constellation {@Mṛgaśiras.@} But it
seems more probable<sup>2</sup> that Mṛga there really covers the whole
of Orion, not merely the inconspicuous group of stars in the
head of Orion that make up the Nakṣatra Mṛgaśiras, but also
the star <lang n="greek">α</lang> in his shoulder, which is reckoned as Ārdrā, and <lang n="greek">γ</lang>
in his left shoulder. Tilak,<sup>3</sup> however, makes Mṛga or Mṛgaśiras
into a different group, consisting of the belt of Orion, with two
stars in the knees and one in the left shoulder, which he
deems to resemble a deer's head with an arrow through it,
an implausible and unlikely theory. {%Cf.%} {@Mṛgavyādha.@}
