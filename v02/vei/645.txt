{@Kuru.@}¦ — The Kurus appear as by far the most important
people in the Brāhmaṇa literature. There is clear evidence
that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied Kuru-
Pañcālas, that the great Brāhmaṇas were composed.<sup>1</sup> The
Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name
being usually coupled with that of the Pañcālas on account of
the intimate connexion of the two peoples. The Kuru-Pañcālas
are often expressly referred to as a united nation.<sup>2</sup> In the land
of the Kuru-Pañcālas speech is said to have its particular
home;<sup>3</sup> the mode of sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas is
proclaimed to be the best;<sup>4</sup> the Kuru-Pañcāla kings perform
the Rājasūya or royal sacrifice;<sup>5</sup> their princes march forth on
raids in the dewy season, and return in the hot season.<sup>6</sup> Later
on the Kuru-Pañcāla Brahmins are famous in the Upaniṣads.<sup>7</sup>
Weber<sup>8</sup> and Grierson<sup>9</sup> have sought to find traces in Vedic
literature of a breach between the two tribes, the latter scholar
seeing therein a confirmation of the theory that the Kurus
belonged to the later stream of immigrants into India, who
were specially Brahminical, as opposed to the Pañcālas, who
were anti-Brahminical. In support of this view, Weber refers
to the story in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>10</sup> of a dispute between
{@Vaka Dālbhya@} and {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya,@} the former
being held to be by origin a Pañcāla, while the latter is held
[Page1-166+ 51]
to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between
Kurus and Pañcālas in the passage in question, which merely
preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a
priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimiṣīya
sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and emphasizes the close
connexion of the two peoples.<sup>11</sup> Secondly, Weber conjectures
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>12</sup> that {@Subhadrikā@} of {@Kāmpila@} was
the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbour-
hood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described
in the Saṃhitā was performed. But the interpretation of this
passage by Weber is open to grave doubt;<sup>13</sup> and in the Kāṇva
recension of the Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> a passage used at the Rājasūya
shows that the Kuru-Pañcālas had actually one king. More-
over, there is the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> that
the old name of the Pañcālas was {@Krivi.@} This word looks very
like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer<sup>16</sup> plausibly conjectures that
the Kurus and Krivis formed the {@Vaikarṇa@}<sup>17</sup> of the Rigveda,
especially as both peoples are found about the Sindhu and the
Asiknī.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with
the locality which they occupied, {@Kurukṣetra,@} We are told,
however, of a domestic priest ({@Purohita@}) in the service of both
the Kurus and the {@Sṛñjayas,@}<sup>19</sup> who must therefore at one time
have been closely connected.<sup>20</sup> In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare ({%aśvā%}),<sup>21</sup>
and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm.<sup>22</sup>
In the Sūtras, again, a ceremony (Vājapeya) of the Kurus is
mentioned.<sup>23</sup> There also a curse, which was pronounced on them
and led to their being driven from Kurukṣetra, is alluded to.<sup>24</sup>
[Page1-167+ 46]
This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in
the epic tradition.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as
a people. But mention is made of a prince, {@Kuruśravaṇa@}
(‘Glory of the Kurus’),<sup>25</sup> and of a {@Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa.@}<sup>26</sup>
In the Atharvaveda<sup>27</sup> there occurs as a king of the Kurus
{@Parikṣit,@} whose son, {@Janamejaya,@} is mentioned in the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as one of the great performers of the horse
sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's<sup>29</sup> that the Kuru
people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to
by other names in the Rigveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his
name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called
Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of {@Trasadasyu,@}’ who is well known
as a king of the {@Pūrus.@} Moreover, it is likely that the Tṛtsu-
{@Bharatas,@} who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pūtus,
later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.<sup>30</sup> Since the
Bharatas appear so prominently in the Brāhmaṇa texts as a
great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them
in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is
evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the
Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn
of the Rigveda<sup>31</sup> as having kindled fire on the {@Dṛṣadvatī,@} the
{@Āpayā,@} and the {@Sarasvatī@} — that is to say, in the sacred places
of the later Kurukṣetra. Similarly, the goddess Bhāratī
(‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the
Āprī (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with Sarasvatī.<sup>32</sup> Again,
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, one Bharata king was
victorious over the Kāśis,<sup>33</sup> and another made offerings to
Gaṅgā and Yamunā,<sup>34</sup> while raids of the Bharatas against the
{@Satvants@} are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>35</sup> Nor is it
[Page1-168+ 60]
without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for
the Kuru Pañcālas in a passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup>
and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice
the names of one Kuru and two Bharata princes are given
without any mention of the people over which they ruled,
while in other cases that information is specifically given.<sup>37</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pañcālas is declared in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country ({@Madhyadeśa@}).<sup>38</sup> A group
of the Kuru people still remained further north — the {@Uttara@}
{@Kurus@} beyond the Himālaya. It appears from a passage of
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners — 
that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus — and of the Kuru-
Pañcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>39</sup> There
seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed
in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that it spread thence
east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the Vrātya
Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical
Āryans) of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>40</sup> and in the fact that in
the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell
in the territory of {@Magadha.@}<sup>41</sup> The repeated mention of Kuru-
Pañcāla Brahmins is another indication of their missionary
activity.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Kuru-Pañcālas renders it
probable that they were later immigrants into India than the
{@Kosala-Videha@} or the {@Kāśis,@}<sup>43</sup> who must have been pushed
[Page1-169+ 71]
into their more eastward territories by a new wave of Āryan
settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic
literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of
the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west.
It has, however, been conjectured,<sup>44</sup> mainly on the ground of
later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the
Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who,
coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original
Āryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country
from east to west. {%Cf.%} also {@Kṛtvan.@} For other Kuru princes

tive of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4,

Videhas are offshoots of the Kuru-
Pañcālas, but Oldenberg and Mac-
donell ({%Sanskrit Literature,%} 214 interpret
this as referring to the spread of
Vedic tradition and culture, not of
nationality.</F>
<F>44) {%Cf.%} Grierson, {%Languages of India,%} 52
{%et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,%}
1908, 837 {%et seq.%} On the other hand, it is
probably an error to assume that the
Bharatas were originally situated far
west of Kurukṣetra, and that the main
action of the Rigveda was confined to
the Panjab. When Vasiṣṭha celebrates
the crossing of the Vipāś and Śutudrī
(Rv. iii. 33), he probably came from
the east, as Pischel, {%Vedische Studien,%}
2, 218, points out, and not from the
west. Adopting the ordinary view,
Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%} 52, finds
it necessary to suggest that Yamunā is
only another name in the Rv. for
the Paruṣṇī. But the necessity for
this suggestion, which is not in itself
plausible, disappears when it is realized
that the Bharatas held a territory
roughly corresponding to Kurukṣetra,
and bounded on the east by the
Yamunā. On the other hand, Hille-
brandt, {%Vedische Mythologie,%} 1, 142, 143.
places the Kurus near the Ārjīkīyā in
Kaśmīr, which puts them too far north.
So also Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 103,
and Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%}
12, xlii. It seems probable that the
Kurus were at a very early period
widely scattered to the north of the
Himālaya, in Kurukṣetra, and about
the Sindhu and Asiknī.
