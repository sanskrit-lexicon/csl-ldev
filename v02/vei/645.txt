{@Kuru.@}¦ — The Kurus appear as by far the most important
<div n="lb"/>people in the Brāhmaṇa literature. There is clear evidence
<div n="lb"/>that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas, that the great Brāhmaṇas were composed.<sup>1</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name
<div n="lb"/>being usually coupled with that of the Pañcālas on account of
<div n="lb"/>the intimate connexion of the two peoples. The Kuru-Pañcālas
<div n="lb"/>are often expressly referred to as a united nation.<sup>2</sup> In the land
<div n="lb"/>of the Kuru-Pañcālas speech is said to have its particular
<div n="lb"/>home;<sup>3</sup> the mode of sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas is
<div n="lb"/>proclaimed to be the best;<sup>4</sup> the Kuru-Pañcāla kings perform
<div n="lb"/>the Rājasūya or royal sacrifice;<sup>5</sup> their princes march forth on
<div n="lb"/>raids in the dewy season, and return in the hot season.<sup>6</sup> Later
<div n="lb"/>on the Kuru-Pañcāla Brahmins are famous in the Upaniṣads.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Weber<sup>8</sup> and Grierson<sup>9</sup> have sought to find traces in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature of a breach between the two tribes, the latter scholar
<div n="lb"/>seeing therein a confirmation of the theory that the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>belonged to the later stream of immigrants into India, who
<div n="lb"/>were specially Brahminical, as opposed to the Pañcālas, who
<div n="lb"/>were anti-Brahminical. In support of this view, Weber refers
<div n="lb"/>to the story in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>10</sup> of a dispute between
<div n="lb"/>{@Vaka Dālbhya@} and {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya,@} the former
<div n="lb"/>being held to be by origin a Pañcāla, while the latter is held
[Page1-166+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between
<div n="lb"/>Kurus and Pañcālas in the passage in question, which merely
<div n="lb"/>preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a
<div n="lb"/>priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimiṣīya
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and emphasizes the close
<div n="lb"/>connexion of the two peoples.<sup>11</sup> Secondly, Weber conjectures
<div n="lb"/>in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>12</sup> that {@Subhadrikā@} of {@Kāmpila@} was
<div n="lb"/>the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbour-
<div n="lb"/>hood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described
<div n="lb"/>in the Saṃhitā was performed. But the interpretation of this
<div n="lb"/>passage by Weber is open to grave doubt;<sup>13</sup> and in the Kāṇva
<div n="lb"/>recension of the Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> a passage used at the Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>shows that the Kuru-Pañcālas had actually one king. More-
<div n="lb"/>over, there is the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> that
<div n="lb"/>the old name of the Pañcālas was {@Krivi.@} This word looks very
<div n="lb"/>like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer<sup>16</sup> plausibly conjectures that
<div n="lb"/>the Kurus and Krivis formed the {@Vaikarṇa@}<sup>17</sup> of the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>especially as both peoples are found about the Sindhu and the
<div n="lb"/>Asiknī.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with
<div n="lb"/>the locality which they occupied, {@Kurukṣetra,@} We are told,
<div n="lb"/>however, of a domestic priest ({@Purohita@}) in the service of both
<div n="lb"/>the Kurus and the {@Sṛñjayas,@}<sup>19</sup> who must therefore at one time
<div n="lb"/>have been closely connected.<sup>20</sup> In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
<div n="lb"/>reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare ({%aśvā%}),<sup>21</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the Sūtras, again, a ceremony (Vājapeya) of the Kurus is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned.<sup>23</sup> There also a curse, which was pronounced on them
<div n="lb"/>and led to their being driven from Kurukṣetra, is alluded to.<sup>24</sup>
[Page1-167+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in
<div n="lb"/>the epic tradition.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as
<div n="lb"/>a people. But mention is made of a prince, {@Kuruśravaṇa@}
<div n="lb"/>(‘Glory of the Kurus’),<sup>25</sup> and of a {@Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa.@}<sup>26</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the Atharvaveda<sup>27</sup> there occurs as a king of the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>{@Parikṣit,@} whose son, {@Janamejaya,@} is mentioned in the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as one of the great performers of the horse
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's<sup>29</sup> that the Kuru
<div n="lb"/>people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to
<div n="lb"/>by other names in the Rigveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his
<div n="lb"/>name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called
<div n="lb"/>Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of {@Trasadasyu,@}’ who is well known
<div n="lb"/>as a king of the {@Pūrus.@} Moreover, it is likely that the Tṛtsu-
<div n="lb"/>{@Bharatas,@} who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pūtus,
<div n="lb"/>later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.<sup>30</sup> Since the
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas appear so prominently in the Brāhmaṇa texts as a
<div n="lb"/>great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them
<div n="lb"/>in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
<div n="lb"/>they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is
<div n="lb"/>evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the
<div n="lb"/>Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda<sup>31</sup> as having kindled fire on the {@Dṛṣadvatī,@} the
<div n="lb"/>{@Āpayā,@} and the {@Sarasvatī@} — that is to say, in the sacred places
<div n="lb"/>of the later Kurukṣetra. Similarly, the goddess Bhāratī
<div n="lb"/>(‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Āprī (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with Sarasvatī.<sup>32</sup> Again,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, one Bharata king was
<div n="lb"/>victorious over the Kāśis,<sup>33</sup> and another made offerings to
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Yamunā,<sup>34</sup> while raids of the Bharatas against the
<div n="lb"/>{@Satvants@} are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>35</sup> Nor is it
[Page1-168+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for
<div n="lb"/>the Kuru Pañcālas in a passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>the names of one Kuru and two Bharata princes are given
<div n="lb"/>without any mention of the people over which they ruled,
<div n="lb"/>while in other cases that information is specifically given.<sup>37</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pañcālas is declared in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country ({@Madhyadeśa@}).<sup>38</sup> A group
<div n="lb"/>of the Kuru people still remained further north — the {@Uttara@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Kurus@} beyond the Himālaya. It appears from a passage of
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners — 
<div n="lb"/>that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus — and of the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>39</sup> There
<div n="lb"/>seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed
<div n="lb"/>in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that it spread thence
<div n="lb"/>east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the Vrātya
<div n="lb"/>Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>Āryans) of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>40</sup> and in the fact that in
<div n="lb"/>the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell
<div n="lb"/>in the territory of {@Magadha.@}<sup>41</sup> The repeated mention of Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcāla Brahmins is another indication of their missionary
<div n="lb"/>activity.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Kuru-Pañcālas renders it
<div n="lb"/>probable that they were later immigrants into India than the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kosala-Videha@} or the {@Kāśis,@}<sup>43</sup> who must have been pushed
[Page1-169+ 71]
<div n="lb"/>into their more eastward territories by a new wave of Āryan
<div n="lb"/>settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of
<div n="lb"/>the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west.
<div n="lb"/>It has, however, been conjectured,<sup>44</sup> mainly on the ground of
<div n="lb"/>later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who,
<div n="lb"/>coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original
<div n="lb"/>Āryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country
<div n="lb"/>from east to west. {%Cf.%} also {@Kṛtvan.@} For other Kuru princes

<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas, but Oldenberg and Mac-
<div n="lb"/>donell ({%Sanskrit Literature,%} 214 interpret
<div n="lb"/>this as referring to the spread of
<div n="lb"/>Vedic tradition and culture, not of
<div n="lb"/>nationality.</F>

<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,%}
<div n="lb"/>1908, 837 {%et seq.%} On the other hand, it is
<div n="lb"/>probably an error to assume that the
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas were originally situated far
<div n="lb"/>west of Kurukṣetra, and that the main
<div n="lb"/>action of the Rigveda was confined to
<div n="lb"/>the Panjab. When Vasiṣṭha celebrates
<div n="lb"/>the crossing of the Vipāś and Śutudrī
<div n="lb"/>(Rv. iii. 33), he probably came from
<div n="lb"/>the east, as Pischel, {%Vedische Studien,%}
<div n="lb"/>2, 218, points out, and not from the
<div n="lb"/>west. Adopting the ordinary view,
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%} 52, finds
<div n="lb"/>it necessary to suggest that Yamunā is
<div n="lb"/>only another name in the Rv. for
<div n="lb"/>the Paruṣṇī. But the necessity for
<div n="lb"/>this suggestion, which is not in itself
<div n="lb"/>plausible, disappears when it is realized
<div n="lb"/>that the Bharatas held a territory
<div n="lb"/>roughly corresponding to Kurukṣetra,
<div n="lb"/>and bounded on the east by the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā. On the other hand, Hille-
<div n="lb"/>brandt, {%Vedische Mythologie,%} 1, 142, 143.
<div n="lb"/>places the Kurus near the Ārjīkīyā in
<div n="lb"/>Kaśmīr, which puts them too far north.
<div n="lb"/>So also Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 103,
<div n="lb"/>and Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%}
<div n="lb"/>12, xlii. It seems probable that the
<div n="lb"/>Kurus were at a very early period
<div n="lb"/>widely scattered to the north of the
<div n="lb"/>Himālaya, in Kurukṣetra, and about
<div n="lb"/>the Sindhu and Asiknī.
