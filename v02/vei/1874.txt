{@Puru-mīḷha@}¦ is mentioned twice in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as an ancient
<div n="lb"/>sage, in which capacity he appears in the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> also.
<div n="lb"/>Perhaps the same<sup>3</sup> Purumīḷha is intended in an obscure hymn
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> where, according to the legends reported in
<div n="lb"/>the Bṛhaddevatā<sup>5</sup> and by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya in his commentary on
<div n="lb"/>the Sarvānukramaṇī,<sup>6</sup> and by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> he as well as {@Taranta@} was a son of Vidadaśva, and
<div n="lb"/>a patron of the singer {@Śyāvāśva.@} The correctness of the legend
<div n="lb"/>has been shown to be most improbable by Oldenberg,<sup>7</sup> who
<div n="lb"/>points out<sup>8</sup> that the legend misinterprets the Rigveda by
<div n="lb"/>making Purumīḷha a Vaidadaśvi, for he is there only compared
<div n="lb"/>in generosity to one.
<div n="P"/>In another legend found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>9</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>based on a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> Purumīḷha and Taranta
<div n="lb"/>appear as persons who received gifts from {@Dhvasra@} and {@Puru-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ṣanti,@} and as sons of Vidadaśva. The legend, which also
<div n="lb"/>occurs in the Śāṭyāyanaka,<sup>11</sup> is apparently best explained by
[Page1-544+ 12]
<div n="lb"/>Sieg,<sup>12</sup> who says that as the two were kings they could not
<div n="lb"/>under the rules of caste accept gifts, unless for the nonce they
<div n="lb"/>became singers. The legend has no claim at all, as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>shows, to validity.
