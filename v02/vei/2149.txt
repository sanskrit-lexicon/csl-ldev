{@Balbūtha@}¦ is mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> along
<div n="lb"/>with {@Tarukṣa@} and {@Pṛthuśravas,@} as a giver of gifts to the singer.
<div n="lb"/>He is called a {@Dāsa,@} but Roth<sup>2</sup> was inclined to amend the text
<div n="lb"/>so as to say that the singer received a hundred Dāsas from
<div n="lb"/>Balbūtha. Zimmer's<sup>3</sup> suggestion that he may have been the
<div n="lb"/>son of an aboriginal mother, or perhaps an aboriginal himself,
<div n="lb"/>seems probable.<sup>4</sup> If this was the case, it would be a clear
<div n="lb"/>piece of evidence for the establishment of friendly relations
<div n="lb"/>between the Āryans and the Dāsas.
