{@Balbūtha@}¦ is mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> along
with {@Tarukṣa@} and {@Pṛthuśravas,@} as a giver of gifts to the singer.
He is called a {@Dāsa,@} but Roth<sup>2</sup> was inclined to amend the text
so as to say that the singer received a hundred Dāsas from
Balbūtha. Zimmer's<sup>3</sup> suggestion that he may have been the
son of an aboriginal mother, or perhaps an aboriginal himself,
seems probable.<sup>4</sup> If this was the case, it would be a clear
piece of evidence for the establishment of friendly relations
between the Āryans and the Dāsas.
