{@Pṛśni-parṇī@}¦ (‘having a speckled leaf’) is the name of a plant
mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as a protection
against evil beings procuring abortion, called Kaṇvas (pre-
sumably a sign of hostility to the {@Kaṇva@} family).<sup>2</sup> It also
appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> being identified with
{%Hermionitis cordifolia%} by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, but
[Page2-019+ 58]
Roth<sup>4</sup> in a subsequent contribution suggests that it is the
same as a plant later called {%lakṣmaṇā,%} and regarded as curing
barrenness. The scholiast on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>5</sup>
thinks that the {%Glycine debilis%} is meant.
