1. {@Brāhmaṇa,@}¦ ‘descendant of a Brahman’ ({%i.e.,%} of a priest), is
<div n="lb"/>found only a few times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and mostly in its latest
[Page2-081+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>parts. In the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and later<sup>3</sup> it is a very common
<div n="lb"/>word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division
<div n="lb"/>of the castes in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems certain that in the Rigveda this Brāhmaṇa, or
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior
<div n="lb"/>and agricultural castes.<sup>5</sup> The texts regularly claim for them a
<div n="lb"/>superiority to the {@Kṣatriya@} caste,<sup>6</sup> and the Brahmin is able by
<div n="lb"/>his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and
<div n="lb"/>the warriors<sup>7</sup> or the different sections of the warriors.<sup>8</sup> If it
<div n="lb"/>is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the {@Rājasūya,@}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so
<div n="lb"/>as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it
<div n="lb"/>is expressly recognized that the union of the Kṣatriya and
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa is essential for complete prosperity.<sup>10</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>admitted<sup>11</sup> that the king or the nobles might at times oppress
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain
<div n="lb"/>swiftly to follow.
[Page2-082+ 55]
<div n="P"/>The Brahmins are gods on earth,<sup>12</sup> like the gods in heaven,
<div n="lb"/>but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> the Brahmin is said to be the
<div n="lb"/>‘recipient of gifts’ ({%ādāyī%}) and the ‘drinker of the offering’
<div n="lb"/>({%āpāyī%}). The other two epithets applied, {%āvasāyī%} and {%yathā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kāma-prayāpya,%} are more obscure; the former denotes either
<div n="lb"/>‘dwelling everywhere’<sup>15</sup> or ‘seeking food’;<sup>16</sup> the latter is usually
<div n="lb"/>taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the
<div n="lb"/>power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the prerogatives of the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min are summed up as (1) Arcā, ‘honour’; (2) Dāna, ‘gifts’;
<div n="lb"/>(3) Ajyeyatā, ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) Avadhyatā,
<div n="lb"/>‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties
<div n="lb"/>are summed up as (5) Brāhmaṇya, ‘purity of descent’;
<div n="lb"/>(6) Pratirūpa-caryā, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and
<div n="lb"/>(7) Loka-pakti, ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching).
<div n="P"/>1. {%Respect paid to Brahmins.%} — The texts are full<sup>18</sup> of references
<div n="lb"/>to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled
<div n="lb"/>{%bhagavant,%}<sup>19</sup> and is provided with good food<sup>20</sup> and entertain-
<div n="lb"/>ment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him
<div n="lb"/>from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood
<div n="lb"/>according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%Gifts to Brahmins.%} — The Dānastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a
<div n="lb"/>recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets
<div n="lb"/>for {@Dakṣiṇās,@} or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting ({@Nārā-@}
[Page2-083+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>{@śaṃsī@}) was often false to please the donors. It was, however,
<div n="lb"/>a rule<sup>23</sup> that Brahmins should not accept what had been
<div n="lb"/>refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of
<div n="lb"/>cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to
<div n="lb"/>receive gifts that the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>24</sup> has to explain
<div n="lb"/>how {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḷha@} became able to accept gifts by
<div n="lb"/>composing a Rigvedic hymn.<sup>25</sup> The exaggerations in the
<div n="lb"/>celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious
<div n="lb"/>result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest ({@Daśan@}).
<div n="lb"/>In some passages<sup>26</sup> certain gifts — those of a horse or sheep — are
<div n="lb"/>forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Immunities of Brahmins.%} — The Brahmin claimed to be
<div n="lb"/>exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When
<div n="lb"/>a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift
<div n="lb"/>does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>27</sup> The king censures all, but not the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin,<sup>28</sup> nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than
<div n="lb"/>an ignorant priest.<sup>29</sup> An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide
<div n="lb"/>(or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal
<div n="lb"/>dispute.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Brahmin's proper food is the {@Soma,@}<sup>31</sup> not {@Surā@}<sup>32</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>{@Parisrut,@}<sup>33</sup> and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh.<sup>34</sup>
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice,<sup>35</sup> for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume
<div n="lb"/>food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot
<div n="lb"/>be a physician,<sup>36</sup> he helps the physician by being beside him
[Page2-084+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>while he exercises his art.<sup>37</sup> His wife<sup>38</sup> and his cow<sup>39</sup> are both
<div n="lb"/>sacred.
<div n="P"/>4. {%Legal Position of Brahmins.%} — The Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>40</sup>
<div n="lb"/>lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown)
<div n="lb"/>for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but
<div n="lb"/>if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only
<div n="lb"/>real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the
<div n="lb"/>Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>41</sup> The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks
<div n="lb"/>above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing
<div n="lb"/>an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}) in the Yajurveda;<sup>42</sup> the crime of slaying an
<div n="lb"/>embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin.<sup>43</sup> The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only
<div n="lb"/>by the horse sacrifice,<sup>44</sup> or by a lesser rite in the late Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyaka.<sup>45</sup> The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the
<div n="lb"/>later ceremonial,<sup>46</sup> and hinted at in the curious legend of
<div n="lb"/>{@Śunaḥśepa;@}<sup>47</sup> and a Purohita might be punished with death for
<div n="lb"/>treachery to his master.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>5. {%Purity of Birth.%} — The importance of pure descent is seen
<div n="lb"/>in the stress laid on being a descendant of a Ṛṣi ({%ārṣeya%}).<sup>49</sup> But,
<div n="lb"/>on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine,
<div n="lb"/>which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true
<div n="lb"/>criterion of Ṛṣihood.<sup>50</sup> In agreement with this is the fact
<div n="lb"/>that {@Satyakāma Jābāla@} was received as a pupil, though his
<div n="lb"/>parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had
<div n="lb"/>been connected with several men,<sup>51</sup> and that in the Śatapatha
[Page2-085+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>52</sup> the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required
<div n="lb"/>merely the name of the pupil. So {@Kavaṣa@} is taunted in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda Brāhmaṇas<sup>53</sup> as being the son of a female slave ({@Dāsī@}),
<div n="lb"/>and {@Vatsa@} cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire
<div n="lb"/>ordeal.<sup>54</sup> Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove
<div n="lb"/>doubts as to origin.<sup>55</sup> In these circumstances it is doubtful
<div n="lb"/>whether much value attaches to the {@Pravara@} lists in which the
<div n="lb"/>ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice by the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu priests.<sup>56</sup> Still, in
<div n="lb"/>many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more genera-
<div n="lb"/>tions was needed,<sup>57</sup> and in one ceremony<sup>58</sup> ten ancestors who
<div n="lb"/>have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of
<div n="lb"/>the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual
<div n="lb"/>variations in schools, like those of the {@Vasiṣṭhas@} and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>6. {%The Conduct of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
<div n="lb"/>to maintain a fair standard of excellence.<sup>59</sup> He was to be kind
<div n="lb"/>to all<sup>60</sup> and gentle,<sup>61</sup> offering sacrifice and receiving gifts.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Especial stress was laid on purity of speech;<sup>63</sup> thus {@Viśvan-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@tara's@} excuse for excluding the {@Śyāparṇas@} from his retinue was
<div n="lb"/>their impure ({%apūtā%}) speech.<sup>64</sup> Theirs was the craving for
<div n="lb"/>knowledge<sup>65</sup> and the life of begging.<sup>66</sup> False Brahmins are
<div n="lb"/>those who do not fulfil their duties<sup>67</sup> ({%cf.%} {@Brahmabandhu@}) .
[Page2-086+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Sūtras, of a
<div n="lb"/>very light and unimportant character.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>7. {%Brahminical Studies.%} — The aim of the priest is to obtain
<div n="lb"/>pre-eminence in sacred knowledge ({%brahma-varcasam%}), as is
<div n="lb"/>stated in numerous passages of Vedic literature.<sup>69</sup> Such
<div n="lb"/>distinction is not indeed confined to the Brahmin: the king
<div n="lb"/>has it also, but it is not really in a special manner appropriate
<div n="lb"/>to the Kṣatriya.<sup>70</sup> Many ritual acts are specified as leading to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmavarcasa,<sup>71</sup> but more stress is laid on the study of the
<div n="lb"/>sacred texts: the importance of such study is repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>insisted upon.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>The technical name for study is Svādhyāya: the Satapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa is eloquent upon its advantages,<sup>73</sup> and it is asserted
<div n="lb"/>that the joy of the learned Śrotriya, or ‘student,’ is equal to
<div n="lb"/>the highest joy possible.<sup>74</sup> {@Nāka Maudgalya@} held that study
<div n="lb"/>and the teaching of others were the true penance ({%tapas%}).<sup>75</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>object was the ‘threefold knowledge’ ({%trayī vidyā%}), that of the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman,<sup>76</sup> a student of all three Vedas being
<div n="lb"/>called {%tri-śukriya%}<sup>77</sup> or {%tri-śukra,%}<sup>78</sup> ‘thrice pure.’ Other objects
<div n="lb"/>of study are enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>79</sup> in the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,<sup>80</sup> the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>81</sup> etc. (See
<div n="lb"/>{@Itihāsa, Purāṇa; Gāthā, Nārāśaṃsī; Brahmodya; Anuśās-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ana, Anuvyākhyāna, Anvākhyāna, Kalpa,@} 2. {@Brāhmaṇa;@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vidyā, Kṣatravidyā, Devajanavidyā, Nakṣatravidyā, Bhūta-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@vidyā, Sarpavidyā; Atharvāṅgirasaḥ, Daiva, Nidhi, Pitrya,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Rāśi; Sūtra,@} etc.)
[Page2-087+ 55]
<div n="P"/>Directions as to the exact place and time of study are given
<div n="lb"/>in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>82</sup> and in the Sūtras. If study is
<div n="lb"/>carried on in the village, it is to be done silently ({%manasā%}); if
<div n="lb"/>outside, aloud ({%vācā%}).
<div n="P"/>Learning is expected even from persons not normally com-
<div n="lb"/>petent as teachers, such as the {@Carakas,@} who are recognized in
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>83</sup> as possible sources of information.
<div n="lb"/>Here, too, may be mentioned the cases of Brahmins learning
<div n="lb"/>from princes, though their absolute value is doubtful, for the
<div n="lb"/>priests would naturally represent their patrons as interested in
<div n="lb"/>their sacred science: it is thus not necessary to see in these
<div n="lb"/>notices any real and independent study on the part of the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas.<sup>84</sup> {@Yājñavalkya@} learnt from {@Janaka,@}<sup>85</sup> {@Uddālaka@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Āruṇi@} and two other Brahmins from {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>86</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{@Dṛptabālāki Gārgya@} from {@Ajātaśatru,@}<sup>87</sup> and five Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>under the lead of Aruṇa from {@Aśvapati Kaikeya.@}<sup>88</sup> A few
<div n="lb"/>notices show the real educators of thought: wandering scholars
<div n="lb"/>went through the country<sup>89</sup> and engaged in disputes and
<div n="lb"/>discussions in which a prize was staked by the disputants.<sup>90</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, kings like Janaka offered rewards to the most learned
<div n="lb"/>of the Brahmins;<sup>91</sup> Ajātaśatru was jealous of his renown, and
<div n="lb"/>imitated his generosity. Again, learned women are several
<div n="lb"/>times mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>A special form of disputation was the {@Brahmodya,@} for which
<div n="lb"/>there was a regular place at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)<sup>93</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and at the Daśarātra (‘ten-day festival’).<sup>94</sup> The reward of
<div n="lb"/>learning was the gaining of the title of Kavi or Vipra, ‘sage.’<sup>95</sup>
[Page2-088+ 56]
<div n="P"/>8. {%The Functions of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
<div n="lb"/>not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give
<div n="lb"/>others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial priest, or as a Purohita.
<div n="P"/>As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of
<div n="lb"/>instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The texts give examples of this, such as Āruṇi and {@Śvetaketu,@}<sup>97</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or mythically Varuṇa and Bhṛgu.<sup>98</sup> This fact also appears
<div n="lb"/>from some of the names in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>99</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>Sāmaveda and the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Śāṅkhāyana
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyaka.<sup>100</sup> On the other hand, these Vaṃśas and the
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśas of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa show that a father often
<div n="lb"/>preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The
<div n="lb"/>relation of pupil and teacher is described under {@Brahmacarya.@}
<div n="lb"/>A teacher might take several pupils,<sup>101</sup> and he was bound to
<div n="lb"/>teach them with all his heart and soul.<sup>102</sup> He was bound to
<div n="lb"/>reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was
<div n="lb"/>staying with him for a year ({%saṃvatsara-vāsin%}),<sup>103</sup> an expression
<div n="lb"/>which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily
<div n="lb"/>change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning
<div n="lb"/>kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumer-
<div n="lb"/>ated.<sup>104</sup> The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately
<div n="lb"/>laid down in the Sūtras,<sup>105</sup> but not in the earlier texts.
<div n="P"/>As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices;
<div n="lb"/>the simple domestic ({%gṛhya%}) rites could normally be performed
<div n="lb"/>without his help, but not the more important rites ({%śrauta%}).
[Page2-089+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests
<div n="lb"/>to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see {@Ṛtvij@}), but other
<div n="lb"/>rites could be accomplished with four,<sup>106</sup> five,<sup>107</sup> six,<sup>108</sup> seven,<sup>109</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or ten<sup>110</sup> priests. Again, the Kauṣītakins<sup>111</sup> had a seventeenth
<div n="lb"/>priest beside the usual sixteen, the Sadasya, so called because
<div n="lb"/>he watched the performance from the Sadas, ‘seat.’ In one
<div n="lb"/>rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> adds three more to the sixteen, a
<div n="lb"/>second Unnetṛ, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual
<div n="lb"/>places the Brahman at the head of all the priests, but this is
<div n="lb"/>probably not the early view (see {@Brahman@}).
<div n="P"/>The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the
<div n="lb"/>advantages of the sacrificer ({%yajamāna%}),<sup>113</sup> but the priest shared
<div n="lb"/>in the profit, besides securing the {@Dakṣiṇās.@} Disputes between
<div n="lb"/>sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyāparṇas,@}<sup>114</sup> or {@Janamejaya@} and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Asitamṛgas;@}<sup>115</sup> and the {@Aiṣāvīras@} are referred to as undesirable
<div n="lb"/>priests.<sup>116</sup> Moreover, {@Viśvāmitra@} once held the post of Puro-
<div n="lb"/>hita to {@Sudās,@} but gave place to {@Vasiṣṭha.@}
[Page2-090+ 53]
<div n="P"/>The position of {@Purohita@} differed considerably from that of
<div n="lb"/>the ordinary priest, for the Purohita not merely might officiate
<div n="lb"/>at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices
<div n="lb"/>of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did,
<div n="lb"/>obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular
<div n="lb"/>importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as
<div n="lb"/>opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on
<div n="lb"/>the Purohita.
<div n="P"/>There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later
<div n="lb"/>prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>cārin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an
<div n="lb"/>ascetic<sup>117</sup> (later divided into the two stages of Vānaprastha,
<div n="lb"/>‘forest-dweller,’ and Saṃnyāsin, ‘mystic’). Yājñavalkya's
<div n="lb"/>case<sup>118</sup> shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all
<div n="lb"/>its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and
<div n="lb"/>family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen<sup>119</sup>
<div n="lb"/>applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are
<div n="lb"/>here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities.<sup>120</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings,
<div n="lb"/>in the Epic tradition,<sup>121</sup> of retiring to the forest when active life
<div n="lb"/>is over.
<div n="P"/>From the Greek authorities<sup>122</sup> it also appears — what is
<div n="lb"/>certainly the case in the Buddhist literature<sup>123</sup> — that Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say
<div n="lb"/>how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the
<div n="lb"/>Druids<sup>124</sup> — in some respects very close — suggests that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional
<div n="lb"/>tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy<sup>125</sup>
[Page2-091+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence,
<div n="lb"/>for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>126</sup> says he is a
<div n="lb"/>poet, his father a physician ({@Bhiṣaj@}), and his mother a grinder
<div n="lb"/>of corn ({@Upala-prakṣiṇī@}). This would seem to show that a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary household duties. So a Purohita could perhaps take
<div n="lb"/>the field to assist the king by prayer, as Viśvāmitra,<sup>127</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>later on Vasiṣṭha<sup>128</sup> do, but this does not show that priests
<div n="lb"/>normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been
<div n="lb"/>agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept
<div n="lb"/>cattle: a Brahmacārin's duty was to watch his master's
<div n="lb"/>cattle.<sup>129</sup> It is therefore needless to suppose that they could
<div n="lb"/>not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercan-
<div n="lb"/>tile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be
<div n="lb"/>remembered that in all probability there was more purity of
<div n="lb"/>blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute.
<div n="P"/>It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, repre-
<div n="lb"/>sented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Kṣatriyas,
<div n="lb"/>if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary
<div n="lb"/>degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the
<div n="lb"/>epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this
<div n="lb"/>character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been
<div n="lb"/>preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A
<div n="lb"/>legend in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>130</sup> shows clearly that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only:
[Page2-092+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>{@Kosala@} and {@Videha,@} no doubt settled by Āryan tribes, are only
<div n="lb"/>rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>tribes (see {@Vrātya@}) had attained intellectual as well as material
<div n="lb"/>civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization
<div n="lb"/>was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of
<div n="lb"/>Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins — not by arms, but
<div n="lb"/>by mind — of the tribes Āryan and non-Āryan originally beyond
<div n="lb"/>the pale.
