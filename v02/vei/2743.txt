{@Lavaṇa,@}¦ ‘salt,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda, only once
in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and not after that until the latest part of
the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>2</sup> where it is regarded as of extremely high
value.<sup>3</sup> This silence in the early period is somewhat surprising
if the regions then occupied by the Indians were the Panjab
and the Indus valley, where salt abounds; it would at first
sight seem less curious if the home of the early Vedic Indian is
taken to be {@Kurukṣetra.@}<sup>4</sup> It is, however, quite conceivable
that a necessary commodity might happen to be passed over
without literary mention in a region where it is very common,
but to be referred to in a locality where it is not found, and
consequently becomes highly prized.
