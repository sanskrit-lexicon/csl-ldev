{@Lavaṇa,@}¦ ‘salt,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda, only once
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and not after that until the latest part of
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>2</sup> where it is regarded as of extremely high
<div n="lb"/>value.<sup>3</sup> This silence in the early period is somewhat surprising
<div n="lb"/>if the regions then occupied by the Indians were the Panjab
<div n="lb"/>and the Indus valley, where salt abounds; it would at first
<div n="lb"/>sight seem less curious if the home of the early Vedic Indian is
<div n="lb"/>taken to be {@Kurukṣetra.@}<sup>4</sup> It is, however, quite conceivable
<div n="lb"/>that a necessary commodity might happen to be passed over
<div n="lb"/>without literary mention in a region where it is very common,
<div n="lb"/>but to be referred to in a locality where it is not found, and
<div n="lb"/>consequently becomes highly prized.
