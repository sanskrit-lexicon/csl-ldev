{@Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana@}¦ is the name of a man, the last for
whom five victims were slain at the building of the sacrificial
altar according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup> The same text<sup>2</sup>
again mentions him as a builder of the fire-altar. He must
have been connected in some way with the {@Salvas.@}<sup>3</sup> His
family, the Śyāparṇas, appear in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> as a
self-assertive family of priests whom king {@Viśvantara@} excluded
from his sacrifice, but whose leader, {@Rāma Mārgaveya,@} induced
him to take them back. In some way Śyāparṇa was connected
with the defeat of the {@Pañcālas@} by the {@Kuntis.@}<sup>5</sup>
