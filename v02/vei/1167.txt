{@Tura Kāvaṣeya@}¦ is mentioned in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers)
at the end of the tenth book of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> as
the source of the doctrine set forth in that book, and as
separated, in the succession of teachers, from {@Śāṇḍilya@} by
{@Yajñavacas@} and {@Kuśri.@} In the same Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he is quoted
by Śāṇḍilya as having erected a fire-altar on the {@Kārotī.@} In
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> he appears as a Purohita, or ‘domestic
priest,’ of {@Janamejaya Pārikṣita,@} whom he consecrated king.
In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>4</sup> and a Khila<sup>5</sup> he appears as
an ancient sage. Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> no doubt rightly, assigns him
to the end of the Vedic period. He is probably<sup>7</sup> identical with
Tura, the {%deva-muni,%} ‘saint of the gods,’ who is mentioned in
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup>
