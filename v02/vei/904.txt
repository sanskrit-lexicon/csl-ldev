{@Go-matī,@}¦ ‘possessing cows,’ is mentioned as a river in the
Nadī-stuti, or ‘Praise of Rivers,’ in the tenth Maṇḍala of the
Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> In that hymn a river flowing into the Indus must
be meant, and its identification<sup>2</sup> with the Gomal, a western
tributary of the Indus, cannot be doubted. In one other passage
of the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> the accentuation of Gomati shows that a river is
meant. It is possible that in a third passage<sup>4</sup> the reading
should be changed to {%gomatír%} from {%gómatīr.%} Geldner<sup>5</sup> suggests
that in the two last passages the Gumti, or rather its four
upper arms (hence the use of the plural) is meant: this accords
well with the later use of the name and with the general
probability of the river here intended being in {@Kurukṣetra,@} as
the centre of Vedic civilization.<sup>6</sup>
