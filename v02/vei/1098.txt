1. {@Takṣan,@}¦ ‘carpenter,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and
often later.<sup>2</sup> He was employed to do all sorts of work in
wood, such as the making of chariots ({@Ratha@}) and wagons
({@Anas@}). Carved work of a finer type seems also to have fallen
to his lot.<sup>3</sup> The axe ({%kuliśa,%}<sup>4</sup> {%paraśu%})<sup>5</sup> is mentioned as one of
his tools, and perhaps the {@Bhurij,@} a word which is, however,
uncertain in sense. In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> reference
seems to be made to the pains of the carpenter in bending
over his work. That the carpenters were a low caste, or
formed a separate class of the people, is certainly not true of
Vedic times.<sup>7</sup>
