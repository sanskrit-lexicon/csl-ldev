{@Niṣka@}¦ is frequently found in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denoting
a gold ornament worn on the neck, as is shown by the two
epithets {%niṣka-kaṇṭha%}<sup>3</sup> and {%niṣka-grīva,%}<sup>4</sup> ‘having a gold ornament
on the neck.’ A Niṣka of silver is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup> As early as the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> traces are seen of the
[Page1-455+ 42]
use of Niṣkas as a sort of currency, for a singer celebrates the
receipt of a hundred Niṣkas and a hundred steeds: he could
hardly require the Niṣkas merely for purposes of personal
adornment. Later the use of Niṣkas as currency is quite clear.<sup>7</sup>
