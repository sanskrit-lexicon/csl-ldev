{@Śaka-dhūma@}¦ is found in one hymn of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where it is celebrated as the king of the asterisms. The word
<div n="lb"/>seems to mean the ‘smoke of (burning) cow-dung,’ or else the
<div n="lb"/>‘smoke (rising) from (fresh) cow-dung’: it may well be, as
<div n="lb"/>Weber<sup>2</sup> thinks, that this was deemed to be significant of the
<div n="lb"/>weather. Bloomfield,<sup>3</sup> however, considers that the word is to
<div n="lb"/>be rendered as ‘weather prophet,’ that is, one who foretells the
<div n="lb"/>weather by means of the smoke of a fire. Whitney<sup>4</sup> objects to
<div n="lb"/>this view with reason. It is not at all improbable that, as
<div n="lb"/>Roth<sup>5</sup> believed, an asterism of some sort is meant, probably
<div n="lb"/>the ‘milky way.’
