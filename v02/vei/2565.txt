{@Yayāti@}¦ is mentioned twice in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> once as an ancient
sacrificer, and once as Nahuṣya, ‘descendant of {@Nahuṣa,@}’
apparently a king. There is no trace whatever of his connexion
with {@Pūru,@} as in the Epic,<sup>2</sup> the tradition of which must be
deemed to be inaccurate.
