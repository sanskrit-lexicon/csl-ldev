{@Aṅka.@}¦ — The Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> and Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> refer to two
Aṅkas and two Nyaṅkas as parts of a chariot. The meaning
of these terms is quite obscure. The commentators refer them
to the sides or wheels. Zimmer<sup>3</sup> compares the Greek <lang n="greek">ἄντυγες</lang><sup>4</sup>
and thinks that the Aṅkau were the upper border of the body
of the chariot ({%kośa, vandhura%}), and the Nyaṅkau the lower rims
for greater security. Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> confesses that the exact sense
is impossible to make out, but considers that the terms at once
refer to parts of the chariot and to divinities, while Böhtlingk<sup>6</sup>
takes the term as referring to divinities alone.
