{@Ṛṣi,@}¦ ‘seer,’ is primarily a composer of hymns to the gods.
In the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> reference is often made to previous singers
and to contemporary poets. Old poems were inherited and
refurbished by members of the composer's family,<sup>2</sup> but the
great aim of the singers was to produce new and approved
hymns.<sup>3</sup> It is not till the time of the Brāhmaṇas that the
[Page1-116+ 62]
composition of hymns appears to have fallen into disuse,<sup>4</sup>
though poetry was still produced, for example, in the form of
{@Gāthās,@} which the priests were required to compose them-
selves<sup>5</sup> and sing to the accompaniment of the lute at the
sacrifice. The Ṛṣi was the most exalted of Brāhmaṇas,<sup>6</sup> and
his skill, which is often compared with that of a carpenter,<sup>7</sup>
was regarded as heaven-sent.<sup>8</sup> The Purohita, whether as Hotṛ
or as Brahman (see {@Ṛtvij@}), was a singer.<sup>9</sup> No doubt the Ṛṣis
were normally<sup>10</sup> attached to the houses of the great, the petty
kings of Vedic times, or the nobles of the royal household.
Nor need it be doubted that occasionally<sup>11</sup> the princes them-
selves essayed poetry: a Rājanyarṣi, the prototype of the later
Rājarṣi or ‘royal seer,’ who appears in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> though he must be mythical as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup>
points out, indicates that kings cultivated poetry<sup>14</sup> just as later
they engaged in philosophic disputations.<sup>15</sup> Normally, how-
ever, the poetical function is Brahminical, Viśāmitra and others
not being kings, but merely Brāhmaṇas, in the Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Ṛṣis are the poets of the hymns
preserved in the Saṃhitās. a Ṛṣi being regularly<sup>16</sup> cited when
a Vedic Saṃhitā is quoted. Moreover, the Ṛṣis become the
representatives of a sacred past, and are regarded as holy sages,
[Page1-117+ 56]
whose deeds are narrated as if they were the deeds of gods or
Asuras.<sup>17</sup> They are typified by a particular group of seven,<sup>18</sup>
mentioned four times in the Rigveda,<sup>19</sup> several times in the
later Saṃhitās,<sup>20</sup> and enumerated in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad<sup>21</sup> as Gotama, Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni,
Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, and Atri. In the Rigveda itself Kutsa,<sup>22</sup>
Atri,<sup>23</sup> Rebha,<sup>24</sup> Agastya,<sup>25</sup> the Kuśikas,<sup>26</sup> Vasiṣṭha,<sup>27</sup> Vyaśva,<sup>28</sup>
and others appear as Ṛṣis; and the Atharvaveda<sup>29</sup> contains a
long list, including Aṅgiras, Agastī, Jamadagni, Atri, Kaśyapa,
Vasiṣṭha, Bharadvāja, Gaviṣṭhira, Viśvāmitra, Kutsa, Kakṣīvant,
Kaṇva, Medhātithi, Triśoka, Uśanā Kāvya, Gotama, and
Mudgala.
<div n="P"/>Competition among the bards appears to have been known.
This is one of the sides of the riddle poetry ({@Brahmodya@}) that
forms a distinctive feature<sup>30</sup> of the Vedic ritual of the Aśva-
medha, or horse sacrifice. In the Upaniṣad period such
competitions were quite frequent. The most famous was that
of Yājñavalkya, which was held at the court of Janaka of
Videha, as detailed in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>31</sup> and
which was a source of annoyance to {@Ajātaśatru@} of {@Kāśī.@}<sup>32</sup>
According to an analogous practice, a Brāhmaṇa, like {@Uddālaka@}
{@Aruṇi,@} would go about disputing with all he came across, and
compete with them for a prize of money.<sup>33</sup>
