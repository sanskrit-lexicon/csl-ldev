{@Kīlāla,@}¦ a word denoting a ‘sweet drink,’ is found in all the
later Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup> but not in the Rigveda. As the Surā-kāra,
‘maker of Surā,’ is dedicated in the list of victims in the human
sacrifice<sup>2</sup> (Puruṣamedha) to Kīlāla, it must have been a drink
of somewhat the same nature as the {@Surā@} itself, possibly, as
Zimmer<sup>3</sup> suggests, a kind of rum.
