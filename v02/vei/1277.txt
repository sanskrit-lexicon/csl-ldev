{@Dasyave vṛka,@}¦ ‘wolf to the {@Dasyu,@}’ is the name of a man
mentioned four times in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> In one hymn<sup>2</sup> he is
called a Ṛṣi, but in two others<sup>3</sup> he is clearly a prince victorious
over the Dasyus, and a generous patron of the singer. It is
hardly necessary to assume different persons,<sup>4</sup> for the term Ṛṣi
is not altogether inconsistent with royalty. He was son of
{@Pūtakratu@}<sup>5</sup> and {@Pūtakratā,@}<sup>6</sup> his wife.
