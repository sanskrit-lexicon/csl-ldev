{@Nyag-rodha,@}¦ ‘growing downwards,’ is the name of the
{%Ficus indica,%} a tree remarkable for sending down from its
branches fibres which take root and form new stems. Though
the tree is not mentioned by name in the Rigveda, it appears
to have been known, as Pischel<sup>1</sup> has shown from a hymn<sup>2</sup> in
which its characteristics may be recognized. It is frequently
mentioned in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> and the later literature.<sup>4</sup> The
sacrificial bowls ({@Camasa@}) were made of its wood.<sup>5</sup> It was
doubtless of the greatest importance, as in modern times, to
the Vedic village. The sister tree, the {@Aśvattha@} ({%Ficus religiosa%}),
already occurs in the Rigveda.
