{@Nyag-rodha,@}¦ ‘growing downwards,’ is the name of the
<div n="lb"/>{%Ficus indica,%} a tree remarkable for sending down from its
<div n="lb"/>branches fibres which take root and form new stems. Though
<div n="lb"/>the tree is not mentioned by name in the Rigveda, it appears
<div n="lb"/>to have been known, as Pischel<sup>1</sup> has shown from a hymn<sup>2</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>which its characteristics may be recognized. It is frequently
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> and the later literature.<sup>4</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial bowls ({@Camasa@}) were made of its wood.<sup>5</sup> It was
<div n="lb"/>doubtless of the greatest importance, as in modern times, to
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic village. The sister tree, the {@Aśvattha@} ({%Ficus religiosa%}),
<div n="lb"/>already occurs in the Rigveda.
