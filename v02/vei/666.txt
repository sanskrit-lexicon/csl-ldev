{@Kuśika@}¦ is the probably mythical forefather<sup>1</sup> of the Kuśikas,
and especially the father of the most important member of
that family, {@Viśvāmitra.@}<sup>2</sup> The Kuśikas are repeatedly referred
[Page1-174+ 52]
to in the third Maṇḍala of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> and figure in the
legend of Śunaḥśepa in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup> They were
clearly a family of priests who attached themselves to the
service of the princes of the {@Bharatas.@} They were especially
devoted to the worship of Indra; hence he is styled Kauśika
even in the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup>
