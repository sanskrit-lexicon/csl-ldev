1. {@Balhika@}¦ is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> where
the fever ({@Takman@}) is called upon to go to the {@Mūjavants,@} the
{@Mahāvṛṣas,@} and the Balhikas. The Mūjavants are quite
certainly a northern tribe, and though, as Bloomfield<sup>2</sup> suggests,
the passage may contain a pun on Balhika as suggesting
‘outsider’ (from {%bahis,%} ‘without’), still no doubt the name was
chosen from a northern tribe. But the view of Roth<sup>3</sup> and
Weber,<sup>4</sup> which Zimmer<sup>5</sup> once accepted, that an Iranian tribe
is referred to ({%cf.%} Balkh), is not at all probable. Zimmer<sup>6</sup>
shows that there is no need whatever to assume Iranian
influence. See also {@Parśu.@}
