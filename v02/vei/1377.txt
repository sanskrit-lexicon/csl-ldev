{@Deśa,@}¦ ‘land,’ is a word that does not come into use till the
time of the Upaniṣads and Sūtras,<sup>1</sup> excepting one occurrence
in the latest period of the Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> literature, and one in
a much-discussed passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>3</sup> where
the {@Sarasvatī@} is mentioned as having five tributaries. This
passage militates against the view that Sarasvatī was a name
of the Indus, because the use of Deśa here seems to indicate<sup>4</sup>
that the seer of the verse placed the Sarasvatī in the Madhya-
deśa or ‘Middle Country,’ to which all the geographical data
of the Yajurvedas point.<sup>5</sup>

the text, where the Sarasvatī originally
meant the Indus, with the five tribu-
taries of the Panjab.</F>
