{@Camū@}¦ denotes the vessel used for the offering to the god,<sup>32</sup>
{@Kalaśa@} and {@Camasa@} those used for the priests to drink from.
Sometimes<sup>33</sup> the Camū denotes the mortar and pestle. Perhaps
the vessel was so called because of its mortar-like shape.
<div n="P"/>The skin on which the shoots were placed was called
{@Tvac,@}<sup>34</sup> or twice {%go%} (‘cow-hide’).<sup>35</sup> {@Kośa,@}<sup>36</sup> Sadhastha,<sup>37</sup> {@Dru,@}<sup>38</sup>
[Page2-477+ 76]
{@Vana,@}<sup>39</sup> {@Droṇa,@}<sup>40</sup> are all terms used for Soma vessels, while
{@Sruva@}<sup>41</sup> denotes the ‘ladle.’
<div n="P"/>Apparently the plant was sometimes steeped in water to
increase its yield of juice.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not possible to describe exactly the details of the process
of pressing the Soma as practised in the Rigveda. It was
certainly purified by being pressed through a sieve<sup>43</sup> ({@Pavitra@}).
The Soma was then used unmixed ({%śukra,%}<sup>44</sup> {%śuci%})<sup>45</sup> for Indra and
{@Vāyu,@} but the {@Kaṇvas@} seem to have dropped this usage.<sup>46</sup> The
juice is described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>47</sup> tawny ({%hari%}),<sup>48</sup> or ruddy
({%aruṇa%}),<sup>49</sup> and as having a fragrant smell,<sup>50</sup> at least as a
rule.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>Soma was mixed with milk ({@Gavāśir@}),<sup>52</sup> curd or sour milk
({@Dadhyāśir@}),<sup>53</sup> or grain ({@Yavāśir@}).<sup>54</sup> The admixtures are
[Page2-478+ 67]
alluded to with various figurative expressions, as {@Atka,@}
‘armour’;<sup>55</sup> {@Vastra@}<sup>56</sup> or {@Vāsas,@}<sup>57</sup> ‘garment’; {@Abhiśrī,@}<sup>58</sup> ‘admix-
ture’; {%rūpa,%}<sup>59</sup> ‘beauty’; {%śrī,%}<sup>60</sup> ‘splendour’; {%rasa,%}<sup>61</sup> ‘flavour’;
{%prayas,%}<sup>62</sup> ‘dainty’; and perhaps {%nabhas,%}<sup>63</sup> ‘fragrance.’ The
adjective {%tīvra%}<sup>64</sup> denotes the ‘pungent’ flavour of Soma when
so mixed. The Soma shoots, after the juice has been pressed
out, are denoted by {%ṛjīṣa,%} ‘residue.’<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that in some cases honey was mixed with
Soma: perhaps the {%kośa madhu-ścut,%} ‘the pail distilling sweet-
ness,’ was used for the mixing.<sup>66</sup> It seems doubtful if Surā was
ever so mixed.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>There were three pressings a day of Soma, as opposed to the
two of the Avesta.<sup>68</sup> The evening pressing was specially
connected with the Ṛbhus, the midday with Indra, the
morning with Agni, but the ritual shows that many other gods
also had their share.<sup>69</sup> The drinker of Soma and the non-
drinker are sharply discriminated in the texts.<sup>70</sup> Localities
where Soma was consumed were {@Ārjīka, Pastyāvant, Śarya-@}
{@ṇāvant, Suṣomā,@} the territory of the {@Pañcajanāḥ@} or ‘five
[Page2-479+ 64]
peoples,’ and so on.<sup>71</sup> The effects of Soma in exhilarating and
exciting the drinkers are often alluded to.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to decide if Soma was ever a popular, as opposed
to a hieratic drink. The evidence for its actual popularity is
very slight,<sup>73</sup> and not decisive.

are quite indecisive. For the various

The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4, dis-
approves of the unmixed Soma. Pos-
sibly Hillebrandt, 1, 207, 208, may be
right in thinking that the Kāṇvas had
to lay special stress on the use of the
mixtures, because they used a plant
which was deficient in the true Soma
character.</F>

This passage has been relied on by
Eggeling, {%op. cit.,%} 26, xxv, as a con-
firmation of the later description, in
a medical work, of the plant as ill-
smelling. But this plant may have
been a different one from that used in
Vedic times. The smell may have
been due to a substitute being used, or
to the genuine plant, brought from a
distance, being old and withered.</F>

{@Saṃvarta Kṛśa,@} viii. 54, 2; {@Nīpātithi,@}
{@Medhyātithi, Puṣṭigu, Śruṣṭigu@}, viii. 51,

need of continuity in Soma-drinking in

It is possible that Soma may have
grown on the mountains to the north
of {@Madhyadeśa,@} whatever may have
been its original home, on which {%cf.%}

<F>72) See Rv. viii. 48. It was equally
prized in Avestic times. It is, however,
seldom spoken of as giving the priests
pleasure: Rv. i. 91, 13; viii. 2, 12;
x. 167, 3. There are many references
to sickness caused by it (Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 13 etc.). The Sautrā-
maṇī was a rite designed to expiate the ill
caused by vomiting Soma as Indra had
done: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 2, 5, 6;
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 9; xii. 7,
1, 11. The name of the rite is already
found in Av. vii. 3, 2, and the rite
itself is no doubt older (see also {@Viṣū-@}
{@cikā@}). This fact tells in favour of the
traditional identification of the plant,
for the medical passage quoted by
Max Müller refers to its producing
vomiting. See also Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}

viii. 2, 12; 17, 6; 48, 12. Perhaps

<F>73) Rv. viii. 69, 8-10. {%Cf.%} viii. 31, 5;
i. 28, 5; Hillebrandt, 1, 143-147. The
evidence is not decisive; the ordinary
Soma sacrifice was clearly a sacrifice
of rich patrons.
