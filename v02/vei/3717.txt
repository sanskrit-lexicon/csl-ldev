{@Strī@}¦ is the ordinary word in poetry and prose for ‘woman,’
without special reference to her as a wife or as a maiden. {@Nārī@}
has the same sense, but disappears in later prose, while {@Gnā@}
refers only to the wives of the gods, and {@Yoṣit,@} with its cognate
words, denotes the young woman as ripe for marriage.<sup>1</sup> In the
Rigveda<sup>2</sup> Strī stands opposed to {@Pumāṃs,@} ‘man,’ and once to
{%vṛṣan,%} ‘male person’; not until the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> does it mean
‘wife’ as opposed to {@Pati,@} ‘husband,’ and even in the Sūtras it
is sharply opposed to {@Jāyā.@}
<div n="P"/>In Vedic India by far the greater part of a woman's life was
taken up in her marriage and marital relations (see Pati and
{@Mātṛ@}). There is no trace in the Rigveda of the seclusion
of women, which was practically complete in all but the
earliest Epic:<sup>4</sup> the maiden may be assumed to have grown up
in her father's house, enjoying free intercourse with the youth
of the village, and sharing in the work of the house. Educa-
tion<sup>5</sup> was not denied to them, at any rate in certain cases, for
we hear in the Upaniṣads of women who could take no
unimportant part in disputations on philosophical topics.
Moreover, women were taught to dance and sing, which were
unmanly accomplishments.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the exact legal position of daughters the notices are few
and meagre. The Rigveda,<sup>7</sup> however, shows that in the place
[Page2-486+ 60]
of a father the brother was looked to for aid, and that brother-
less maidens were apt to be ruined, though religious terrors
were believed to await the man who took advantage of their
defencelessness.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, women could not take an inherit-
ance,<sup>9</sup> and were not independent persons in the eyes of the
law, whether married or not. Presumably before marriage
they lived on their parents or brothers, and after that on their
husbands, while in the event of their husbands predeceasing
them, their relatives took the property, burdened with the
necessity of maintaining the wife.<sup>10</sup> Their earnings would be
appropriated by their nearest relative — usually father or brother
-in the few cases in which unmarried women could earn
anything, as in the case of courtezans.
