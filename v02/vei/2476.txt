{@Māsa@}¦ denotes a ‘month,’ a period of time repeatedly men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the Rigveda and later.
<div n="P"/>The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were
<div n="lb"/>those of the new moon, Amā-vasyā, ‘home-staying (night),’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘of the full moon,’ Paurṇa-māsī. Two hymns of the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>1</sup> celebrate these days respectively. A personification of
<div n="lb"/>the phases of the moon is seen in the four names Sinīvālī,<sup>2</sup>
[Page2-157+ 72]
<div n="lb"/>the day before new moon; Kuhū,<sup>3</sup> also called Guṅgū,<sup>4</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>new moon day; Anumati,<sup>5</sup> the day before full moon; and
<div n="lb"/>Rākā,<sup>6</sup> the day of new moon. The importance of the new and
<div n="lb"/>full moon days is seen in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, or festivals
<div n="lb"/>of the new and full moon days respectively.
<div n="P"/>One special day in the month, the {@Ekāṣṭakā,@} or eighth day
<div n="lb"/>after full moon, was important. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned
<div n="lb"/>between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of
<div n="lb"/>new moon. But one Ekāṣṭakā is referred to in the Yajurveda
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās and elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as of quite special importance. This
<div n="lb"/>was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the
<div n="lb"/>eighth day after the full moon of {@Māgha.@} It marked the end
<div n="lb"/>of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the
<div n="lb"/>Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> places the winter solstice in the new
<div n="lb"/>moon of Māgha, the latter date probably means the new moon
<div n="lb"/>preceding full moon in Māgha,<sup>10</sup> not the new moon following
[Page2-158+ 74]
<div n="lb"/>full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for
<div n="lb"/>the importance of the Ekāṣṭakā as being the first Aṣṭakā
<div n="lb"/>after the beginning of the new year.
<div n="P"/>It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether
<div n="lb"/>from the day after new moon to new moon — the system known
<div n="lb"/>as {%amānta,%} or from the day after full moon to full moon — the {%pūr-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṇimānta%} system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North
<div n="lb"/>India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>argues that the year began in the full moon of Phālguna, and
<div n="lb"/>that only by the full moon's conjunction with the Nakṣatra could
<div n="lb"/>the month be known. Oldenberg<sup>12</sup> points to the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full
<div n="lb"/>moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with
<div n="lb"/>the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of
<div n="lb"/>the month into the former ({%pūrva%}) and latter ({%apara%}) halves,
<div n="lb"/>the first being the bright ({%śukla%}), the second the dark ({%kṛṣṇa%})
<div n="lb"/>period. Thibaut<sup>13</sup> considers that to assume the existence of
<div n="lb"/>the {%pūrṇimānta%} system for the Veda is unnecessary, though
<div n="lb"/>possible. Weber<sup>10</sup> assumes that it occurs in the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably
<div n="lb"/>be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the
<div n="lb"/>{%amānta%} system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at
<div n="lb"/>least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as
<div n="lb"/>beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded
<div n="lb"/>full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of the month.
<div n="P"/>That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the
<div n="lb"/>conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is
<div n="lb"/>given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the
<div n="lb"/>earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to.<sup>14</sup>
[Page2-159+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>It is the regular month of the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>15</sup> and must be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized.
<div n="lb"/>No other month is mentioned as such in the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>literature; it is only in the Sūtras that months of different
<div n="lb"/>length occur. The Sāmaveda Sūtras<sup>16</sup> refer to (1) years with
<div n="lb"/>324 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each;
<div n="lb"/>(2) years with 351 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of
<div n="lb"/>27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with
<div n="lb"/>354 days — {%i.e.,%} 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in
<div n="lb"/>other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or
<div n="lb"/>ordinary civil ({%sāvana%}) years; (5) years with 378 days, which,
<div n="lb"/>as Thibaut<sup>17</sup> clearly shows, are third years, in which, after
<div n="lb"/>two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about
<div n="lb"/>correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of
<div n="lb"/>366 days. But even the Sāmasūtras do not mention the year
<div n="lb"/>of 366 days, which is first known to the Jyotiṣa<sup>18</sup> and to
<div n="lb"/>Garga.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of
<div n="lb"/>354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer,<sup>20</sup> indeed,
<div n="lb"/>thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated
<div n="lb"/>at ten months, or sometimes a year.<sup>21</sup> But Weber<sup>22</sup> may be
<div n="lb"/>right in holding that the month is the periodic month of
<div n="lb"/>27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits
<div n="lb"/>the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month,
<div n="lb"/>so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant.
[Page2-160+ 57]
<div n="P"/>The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly
<div n="lb"/>quite unscientific, Zimmer<sup>23</sup> is strongly of opinion that it was
<div n="lb"/>only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took
<div n="lb"/>place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex,
<div n="lb"/>normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well
<div n="lb"/>known from the Jyotṣa: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days
<div n="lb"/>each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one
<div n="lb"/>in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days,
<div n="lb"/>or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year
<div n="lb"/>of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too
<div n="lb"/>long;<sup>24</sup> but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa period, during which no decision as to the true
<div n="lb"/>length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The
<div n="lb"/>references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda<sup>25</sup> are not even
<div n="lb"/>reasonably plausible, while the {%pañcaka yuga,%} cited by him from
<div n="lb"/>the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>26</sup> occurs only in a quotation in
<div n="lb"/>a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to
<div n="lb"/>bring the year of 360 days — a synodic lunar year — roughly
<div n="lb"/>into connexion with reality. A Sāmasūtra<sup>27</sup> treats it as a
<div n="lb"/>solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in
<div n="lb"/>13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days
<div n="lb"/>every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature, from the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> downwards,<sup>29</sup> teems with
<div n="lb"/>the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month.
<div n="lb"/>The length is variously given as 30 days,<sup>30</sup> 35 days,<sup>31</sup> or
[Page2-161+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>36 days.<sup>32</sup> The last number possibly indicates an intercalation
<div n="lb"/>after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for
<div n="lb"/>this we have no special evidence. There are many references<sup>33</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to the year having 12 or 13 months.
<div n="P"/>The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all
<div n="lb"/>ancient. The sacrificial texts of the Yajurveda give them in
<div n="lb"/>their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the
<div n="lb"/>fire-altar,’ is described.<sup>34</sup> These names are the following:
<div n="lb"/>(1) Madhu, (2) Mādhava (spring months, {%vāsantikāv ṛtū%});
<div n="lb"/>(3) Śukra, (4) Śuci (summer months, {%graiṣmāv ṛtū%}); (5) Nabha
<div n="lb"/>(or Nabhas),<sup>35</sup> (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, {%vārṣikāv ṛtū%});
<div n="lb"/>(7) Iṣa, (8) Ūrja (autumn months, {%śāradāv ṛtū%}); (9) Saha (or
<div n="lb"/>Sahas),<sup>35</sup> (10) Sahasya (winter months, {%haimantikāv ṛtū%});
<div n="lb"/>(11) Tapa (or Tapas),<sup>35</sup> (12) Tapasya (cool months, {%śaiśirāv%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṛtū%}).
<div n="P"/>There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice<sup>36</sup> and of the horse sacrifice,<sup>37</sup> all of them agreeing in
<div n="lb"/>essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names,<sup>38</sup>
<div n="lb"/>but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in
<div n="lb"/>popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than
<div n="lb"/>a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that Madhu
<div n="lb"/>and Mādhava later appear as names of spring, and that these
<div n="lb"/>two are mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>39</sup> as if actually
[Page2-162+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that
<div n="lb"/>the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary
<div n="lb"/>use.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned.
<div n="lb"/>The name given to it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>41</sup> is Aṃhasas-
<div n="lb"/>pati, while that given in the Taittirīya<sup>42</sup> and Maitrāyaṇī
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās<sup>43</sup> is Saṃsarpa. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>44</sup> gives it the
<div n="lb"/>name of Malimluca, which also occurs elsewhere, along with
<div n="lb"/>Saṃsarpa, in one of the lists of fanciful names.<sup>45</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>46</sup> describes it as {%sanisrasa,%} ‘slipping,’ owing no
<div n="lb"/>doubt to its unstable condition.
<div n="P"/>The other method of naming the months is from the
<div n="lb"/>{@Nakṣatras.@} It is only beginning to be used in the Brāhmaṇas,
<div n="lb"/>but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The Jyotiṣa<sup>47</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions that Māgha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair
<div n="lb"/>interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identifica-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Madhu with Caitra, a result corresponding with the
<div n="lb"/>view frequently found in the Brāhmaṇas, that the full moon in
<div n="lb"/>Citrā, and not that in Phalgunī, is the beginning of the year.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>49</sup> are found two curious ex-
<div n="lb"/>pressions, {%yava%} and {%ayava,%} for the light and dark halves of the
<div n="lb"/>month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half.
<div n="lb"/>Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling<sup>50</sup> thinks, from {%yu,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word {@Parvan@}
[Page2-163+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>(‘joint’ = division of time) probably<sup>51</sup> denotes a half of the
<div n="lb"/>month, perhaps already in the Rigveda.<sup>52</sup> More precisely the
<div n="lb"/>first half, the time of the waxing light, is called {%pūrva-pakṣa,%}<sup>53</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the second, that of the waning light, {%apara-pakṣa,%}<sup>54</sup> Either of
<div n="lb"/>these might be called a half-month ({%ardha-māsa%}).<sup>55</sup>

<F>48) Weber's theory (359) that Caitra
<div n="lb"/>was as the first spring month secondary
<div n="lb"/>to Phālguna is, of course, an error;
<div n="lb"/>for, owing to the precession of the
<div n="lb"/>equinoxes, Phālguna became the first
<div n="lb"/>month of spring {%de facto,%} while Caitra
<div n="lb"/>became virtually the last month of the
<div n="lb"/>preceding season. The truth is that
<div n="lb"/>the six seasons are an arbitrary division
<div n="lb"/>of the year, and that either Phālguna
<div n="lb"/>or Caitra could be regarded as the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of spring without much im-
<div n="lb"/>propriety. See Weber, {%Indische Studien,%}
