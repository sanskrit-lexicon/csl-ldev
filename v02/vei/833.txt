{@Khṛgala,@}¦ or, as the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup>
has it, Khugila, is an obscure expression found in two passages
only — once in the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> and once in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup>
In the former the meaning ‘crutch’ seems required; in the
latter Sāyaṇa glosses it by ‘armour’ ({%tanu-trāṇa%}), but the sense
is quite uncertain.
