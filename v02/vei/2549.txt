{@Yakṣma@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> frequently
denotes ‘illness,’ in general, perhaps as rendering the body
emaciated. A hundred kinds of Yakṣma are referred to in the
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>3</sup> and {%a-yakṣma%} in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>4</sup>
[Page2-183+ 59]
denotes ‘free from disease.’ In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>5</sup> an
account is given of the origin of Yakṣma, which is distinguished
as of three kinds — {@Rāja-yakṣma,@} ‘royal Yakṣma,’ Pāpa-yakṣma,
‘evil Yakṣma,’ and {@Jāyenya,@} most probably ‘syphilis.’ The
second of the series is elsewhere unknown, and can hardly be
defined, for it merely means ‘serious or deadly disease.’ {%Cf.%}
