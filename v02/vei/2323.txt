{@Maṇi@}¦ is the name in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> of a ‘jewel’ used
as an amulet against all kinds of evil. That either ‘pearl’<sup>3</sup> or
‘diamond’<sup>4</sup> is denoted is not clear.<sup>5</sup> It is evident that the
[Page2-120+ 61]
Maṇi could be strung on a thread ({%sūtra%}), which is referred to
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> and elsewhere;<sup>7</sup> the Maṇi was
certainly also worn round the neck, for in the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> occurs
the epithet {%maṇi-grīva,%} ‘having a jewel on the neck.’ An
amulet of Bilva is celebrated in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,<sup>9</sup>
and many varieties of amulet are there enumerated.<sup>10</sup> The
‘jeweller’ ({%maṇi-kāra%}) is mentioned in the list of victims at the
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>11</sup>
