{@Mleccha@}¦ occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> in the sense of
a barbarian in speech. The Brahmin is there forbidden to
use barbarian speech. The example<sup>2</sup> given of such speech is
{%lie 'lavo,%} explained by Sāyaṇa as {%he 'rayaḥ,%} ‘ho, foes.’ If this
is correct — the Kāṇva recension has a different reading<sup>3</sup> — the
barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though not speakers
of Sanskrit, but of a Prākṛta form of speech.<sup>4</sup> {%Cf.%} {@Vāc.@}
