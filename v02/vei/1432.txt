{@Dharma,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Dharman,@}<sup>2</sup> are the regular words, the latter in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and both later,<sup>2</sup> for ‘law’ or ‘custom.’ But there is
<div n="lb"/>very little evidence in the early literature as to the administra-
<div n="lb"/>tion of justice or the code of law followed. On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>the Dharma Sūtras<sup>3</sup> contain full particulars.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%Criminal Law.%} — The crimes recognized in Vedic litera-
<div n="lb"/>ture vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction
<div n="lb"/>adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are
<div n="lb"/>regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely
[Page1-391+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>conventional practices.<sup>4</sup> The crimes enumerated include the
<div n="lb"/>slaying of an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}),<sup>5</sup> the slaying of a man ({%vīra%}),<sup>6</sup> and
<div n="lb"/> the slaying of a Brahmin,<sup>7</sup> a much more serious crime.
<div n="lb"/>Treachery is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as being
<div n="lb"/>punishable by death, as it was punished later.<sup>9</sup> But there is no
<div n="lb"/>trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the
<div n="lb"/>king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the
<div n="lb"/>system of wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which indicates that criminal justice
<div n="lb"/>remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras,<sup>10</sup> on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as
<div n="lb"/>infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according
<div n="lb"/>to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there-
[Page1-392+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdic-
<div n="lb"/>tion steadily increased; the references in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa to the king as wielding punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}) confirm
<div n="lb"/>this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems
<div n="lb"/>suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he
<div n="lb"/>undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>caste, cannot be made out clearly.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>12</sup> the ordeal of the red-hot axe is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must
<div n="lb"/>apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction
<div n="lb"/>of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature (see {@Divya@}). The punishment of theft was in some
<div n="lb"/>cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken red-
<div n="lb"/>handed;<sup>13</sup> in other cases binding to posts was the penalty,<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In
<div n="lb"/>the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the list of sins given as apparently
<div n="lb"/>equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a
<div n="lb"/>Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>(2) {%Civil Law.%} — There is little recorded as to civil law in
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question
<div n="lb"/>of family property are dealt with under {@Urvarā, Kṣetra, Pati;@}
<div n="lb"/>succession and partition of property are treated under {@Dāya.@}
<div n="lb"/>As regards the transfer of chattels — for land as transferable
<div n="lb"/>{%inter vivos%} is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial fee ({@Dakṣiṇā@}), and then disapproved<sup>16</sup> — the recognized
<div n="lb"/>modes are gift ({@Dāna@}) and barter or sale ({@Kraya@}), which includes
<div n="lb"/>exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought
[Page1-393+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen,<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them,
<div n="lb"/>provided that they were found on one's own land or on
<div n="lb"/>unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person
<div n="lb"/>originally. The Sūtras<sup>18</sup> contain rules for the disposal of lost
<div n="lb"/>property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction
<div n="lb"/>of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to money-
<div n="lb"/>lending (for which see {@Ṛṇa@}), practically nothing is to be gathered
<div n="lb"/>from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive
<div n="lb"/>conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour,
<div n="lb"/>which would in a more developed society have been done by
<div n="lb"/>workers for hire, would be performed by slaves ({%cf.%} {@Dāsa,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Śūdra@}), while the technical workers of the village — of whom
<div n="lb"/>long lists are given in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>19</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> — may have been recompensed not by
<div n="lb"/>any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allow-
<div n="lb"/>ances, much as the village servants are in modern times.<sup>21</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain
<div n="lb"/>what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village.
<div n="lb"/>Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any
<div n="lb"/>legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for
<div n="lb"/>insults appear in the Sūtras.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list<sup>23</sup> of victims
<div n="lb"/>at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a {%praśnin,%}
<div n="lb"/>an {%abhi-praśnin,%} and a {%praśna-vivāka,%} in whom it is not un-
<div n="lb"/>reasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator
<div n="lb"/>or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early
[Page1-394+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same
<div n="lb"/>idea may be conveyed by the word {%madhyama-śī,%} ‘lying in the
<div n="lb"/>midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> and which Roth,<sup>25</sup>
<div n="lb"/>followed by Zimmer,<sup>26</sup> understood to mean an arbitrator or
<div n="lb"/>judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with
<div n="lb"/>other judicial persons,<sup>27</sup> and being surrounded by the assembly
<div n="lb"/>of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney<sup>28</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom
<div n="lb"/>his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and
<div n="lb"/>may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction
<div n="lb"/>with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to
<div n="lb"/>conjecture.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see {@Jñātṛ@}),
<div n="lb"/>and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter
<div n="lb"/>except the dispute between {@Vatsa@} and his rival as to the true
<div n="lb"/>Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his
<div n="lb"/>walking unharmed through the flame of a fire.<sup>30</sup> But it is
<div n="lb"/>probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for
<div n="lb"/>the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was
<div n="lb"/>so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are very few references to police officials: no doubt
<div n="lb"/>the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences
<div n="lb"/>and arrest offenders (see {@Ugra, Jīvagṛbh@}).
<div n="P"/>(3) {%Morality.%} — It is convenient to notice under this head
[Page1-395+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>several points bearing on the moral condition of the people:
<div n="lb"/>({%a%}) the exposure of children; ({%b%}) the exposure of the aged;
<div n="lb"/>({%c%}) prostitution; ({%d%}) adultery; ({%e%}) incest.
<div n="P"/>({%a%}) The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer<sup>32</sup> on
<div n="lb"/>the strength of a passage in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>33</sup> but it
<div n="lb"/>seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood,<sup>34</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it,
<div n="lb"/>while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth
<div n="lb"/>of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in
<div n="lb"/>an early society, and paralleled among other Āryan peoples.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>from a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>37</sup> and from the mention of
<div n="lb"/>persons exposed ({%ud-hitāḥ%}) in the Atharvaveda.<sup>38</sup> The latter
<div n="lb"/>passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed
<div n="lb"/>after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The
<div n="lb"/>former passage merely refers to the individual case of some
<div n="lb"/>person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely
<div n="lb"/>nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a
<div n="lb"/>custom be inferred from, {%e.g.,%} the legend of {@Cyavāna.@}
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain,
<div n="lb"/>but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently
<div n="lb"/>reduced to becoming prostitutes;<sup>39</sup> the putting away of an
<div n="lb"/>illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda;<sup>40</sup> besides the
[Page1-396+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>terms {%puṃścalī%}<sup>41</sup> and {%mahānagnī,%}<sup>42</sup> which undoubtedly mean
<div n="lb"/>‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution;<sup>43</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>expressions like {%kumārī-putra,%} ‘son of a maiden,’<sup>44</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>‘son of an unmarried girl’ ({%agrū%}), spoken of in the Rigveda<sup>45</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same
<div n="lb"/>direction. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>46</sup> seems to recognize
<div n="lb"/>prostitution as a profession. Pischel<sup>47</sup> sees many references
<div n="lb"/>to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner<sup>48</sup> insists reflects in
<div n="lb"/>its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correct-
<div n="lb"/>ness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by
<div n="lb"/>any means certain.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%d%}) Adultery was generally regarded among Āryan peoples
<div n="lb"/>as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected.
<div n="lb"/>We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of
<div n="lb"/>the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken
<div n="lb"/>in the act.<sup>50</sup> Weber,<sup>51</sup> however, has adduced some material
<div n="lb"/>indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>52</sup> has adopted the same view. But, as Delbrück<sup>53</sup> has
<div n="lb"/>clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited pre-
<div n="lb"/>scriptions<sup>54</sup> forbidding connexion with another man's wife
<div n="lb"/>during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would
<div n="lb"/>otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varuṇa-praghāsas,<sup>55</sup>
<div n="lb"/>when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have
<div n="lb"/>been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family
<div n="lb"/>by a wife's fall; {@Yājñavalkya's@} famous saying<sup>56</sup> that no one
[Page1-397+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ ({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not is a
<div n="lb"/>mere mistranslation,<sup>57</sup> the expression {%paraḥ-puṃsā%} really mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty
<div n="lb"/>asserted in some passages<sup>58</sup> as to origin from a Ṛṣi is not a
<div n="lb"/>sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that Ṛṣihood
<div n="lb"/>was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's
<div n="lb"/>position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such
<div n="lb"/>stories as that of Ahalyā and Indra<sup>59</sup> are not compatible with
<div n="lb"/>a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is
<div n="lb"/>pointed to by references in the Yajurveda<sup>60</sup> to relations between
<div n="lb"/>the Ārya man and the Śūdrā woman, and by a spell given in
<div n="lb"/>the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>61</sup> to expiate relations with the
<div n="lb"/>wife of a Śrotriya (Brahmin theologian).
<div n="P"/>({%e%}) Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and
<div n="lb"/>sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yamī in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>62</sup> which clearly shows that such a marriage was not
<div n="lb"/>approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another
<div n="lb"/>hymn<sup>63</sup> in which reference to such intercourse appears to be
<div n="lb"/>made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda<sup>64</sup> to the
<div n="lb"/>wedlock of Prajāpati and his daughter, which is, however,
<div n="lb"/>interpreted mythologically in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>65</sup> an interpre-
<div n="lb"/>tation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually
<div n="lb"/>did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda;<sup>66</sup> but even though
<div n="lb"/>the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justi-
<div n="lb"/>fied, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the
<div n="lb"/>normal occurrence of such relations.
