{@Dharma,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Dharman,@}<sup>2</sup> are the regular words, the latter in the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and both later,<sup>2</sup> for ‘law’ or ‘custom.’ But there is
very little evidence in the early literature as to the administra-
tion of justice or the code of law followed. On the other hand,
the Dharma Sūtras<sup>3</sup> contain full particulars.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%Criminal Law.%} — The crimes recognized in Vedic litera-
ture vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction
adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are
regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely
[Page1-391+ 80]
conventional practices.<sup>4</sup> The crimes enumerated include the
slaying of an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}),<sup>5</sup> the slaying of a man ({%vīra%}),<sup>6</sup> and
 the slaying of a Brahmin,<sup>7</sup> a much more serious crime.
Treachery is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as being
punishable by death, as it was punished later.<sup>9</sup> But there is no
trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the
king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the
system of wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which indicates that criminal justice
remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the
Sūtras,<sup>10</sup> on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as
infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according
to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there-
[Page1-392+ 54]
fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdic-
tion steadily increased; the references in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa to the king as wielding punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}) confirm
this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems
suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he
undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin
caste, cannot be made out clearly.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain.
In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>12</sup> the ordeal of the red-hot axe is
mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must
apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction
of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic
literature (see {@Divya@}). The punishment of theft was in some
cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken red-
handed;<sup>13</sup> in other cases binding to posts was the penalty,<sup>14</sup>
presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In
the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the list of sins given as apparently
equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a
Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>(2) {%Civil Law.%} — There is little recorded as to civil law in
Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question
of family property are dealt with under {@Urvarā, Kṣetra, Pati;@}
succession and partition of property are treated under {@Dāya.@}
As regards the transfer of chattels — for land as transferable
{%inter vivos%} is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a
sacrificial fee ({@Dakṣiṇā@}), and then disapproved<sup>16</sup> — the recognized
modes are gift ({@Dāna@}) and barter or sale ({@Kraya@}), which includes
exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought
[Page1-393+ 52]
about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen,<sup>17</sup>
while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them,
provided that they were found on one's own land or on
unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person
originally. The Sūtras<sup>18</sup> contain rules for the disposal of lost
property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction
of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin,
who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to money-
lending (for which see {@Ṛṇa@}), practically nothing is to be gathered
from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive
conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour,
which would in a more developed society have been done by
workers for hire, would be performed by slaves ({%cf.%} {@Dāsa,@}
{@Śūdra@}), while the technical workers of the village — of whom
long lists are given in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>19</sup> and the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> — may have been recompensed not by
any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allow-
ances, much as the village servants are in modern times.<sup>21</sup> But
this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain
what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village.
Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any
legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for
insults appear in the Sūtras.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list<sup>23</sup> of victims
at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a {%praśnin,%}
an {%abhi-praśnin,%} and a {%praśna-vivāka,%} in whom it is not un-
reasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator
or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early
[Page1-394+ 59]
form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same
idea may be conveyed by the word {%madhyama-śī,%} ‘lying in the
midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> and which Roth,<sup>25</sup>
followed by Zimmer,<sup>26</sup> understood to mean an arbitrator or
judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with
other judicial persons,<sup>27</sup> and being surrounded by the assembly
of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney<sup>28</sup>
thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom
his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and
may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction
with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to
conjecture.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see {@Jñātṛ@}),
and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter
except the dispute between {@Vatsa@} and his rival as to the true
Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his
walking unharmed through the flame of a fire.<sup>30</sup> But it is
probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for
the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was
so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that
a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are very few references to police officials: no doubt
the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences
and arrest offenders (see {@Ugra, Jīvagṛbh@}).
<div n="P"/>(3) {%Morality.%} — It is convenient to notice under this head
[Page1-395+ 61]
several points bearing on the moral condition of the people:
({%a%}) the exposure of children; ({%b%}) the exposure of the aged;
({%c%}) prostitution; ({%d%}) adultery; ({%e%}) incest.
<div n="P"/>({%a%}) The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer<sup>32</sup> on
the strength of a passage in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>33</sup> but it
seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood,<sup>34</sup> and
that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it,
while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth
of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in
an early society, and paralleled among other Āryan peoples.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
from a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>37</sup> and from the mention of
persons exposed ({%ud-hitāḥ%}) in the Atharvaveda.<sup>38</sup> The latter
passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed
after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The
former passage merely refers to the individual case of some
person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely
nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a
custom be inferred from, {%e.g.,%} the legend of {@Cyavāna.@}
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain,
but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently
reduced to becoming prostitutes;<sup>39</sup> the putting away of an
illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda;<sup>40</sup> besides the
[Page1-396+ 61]
terms {%puṃścalī%}<sup>41</sup> and {%mahānagnī,%}<sup>42</sup> which undoubtedly mean
‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution;<sup>43</sup> and
expressions like {%kumārī-putra,%} ‘son of a maiden,’<sup>44</sup> and the
‘son of an unmarried girl’ ({%agrū%}), spoken of in the Rigveda<sup>45</sup>
as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same
direction. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>46</sup> seems to recognize
prostitution as a profession. Pischel<sup>47</sup> sees many references
to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner<sup>48</sup> insists reflects in
its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correct-
ness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by
any means certain.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%d%}) Adultery was generally regarded among Āryan peoples
as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected.
We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of
the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken
in the act.<sup>50</sup> Weber,<sup>51</sup> however, has adduced some material
indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and
Ludwig<sup>52</sup> has adopted the same view. But, as Delbrück<sup>53</sup> has
clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited pre-
scriptions<sup>54</sup> forbidding connexion with another man's wife
during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would
otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varuṇa-praghāsas,<sup>55</sup>
when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have
been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family
by a wife's fall; {@Yājñavalkya's@} famous saying<sup>56</sup> that no one
[Page1-397+ 48]
cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ ({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not is a
mere mistranslation,<sup>57</sup> the expression {%paraḥ-puṃsā%} really mean-
ing ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty
asserted in some passages<sup>58</sup> as to origin from a Ṛṣi is not a
sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that Ṛṣihood
was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's
position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such
stories as that of Ahalyā and Indra<sup>59</sup> are not compatible with
a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is
pointed to by references in the Yajurveda<sup>60</sup> to relations between
the Ārya man and the Śūdrā woman, and by a spell given in
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>61</sup> to expiate relations with the
wife of a Śrotriya (Brahmin theologian).
<div n="P"/>({%e%}) Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and
sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yamī in the
Rigveda,<sup>62</sup> which clearly shows that such a marriage was not
approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another
hymn<sup>63</sup> in which reference to such intercourse appears to be
made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda<sup>64</sup> to the
wedlock of Prajāpati and his daughter, which is, however,
interpreted mythologically in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>65</sup> an interpre-
tation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually
did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda;<sup>66</sup> but even though
the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justi-
fied, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the
normal occurrence of such relations.
