17. {@Vicṛtau,@}¦ ‘the two releasers’; {@Mūla,@} ‘root’; or {@Mūla-@}
{@barhaṇī,@} ‘uprooting,’ denote primarily <lang n="greek">λ</lang> and <lang n="greek">ν</lang> at the extremity
of the tail of the Scorpion, but including also the nine or
eleven stars from <lang n="greek">ε</lang> to <lang n="greek">ν</lang>.
<div n="P"/>18, 19. {@Aṣāḍhās@} (‘unconquered’), distinguished as {@Pūrvās,@}
‘former,’ and {@Uttarās,@} ‘latter,’ are really two constellations, of
which the former is composed of <lang n="greek">γ, δ, ε</lang>, and <lang n="greek">η</lang> Sagittarii, or of
<lang n="greek">δ</lang> and <lang n="greek">ε</lang> only, and the latter of <lang n="greek">θ, σ, τ</lang>, and <lang n="greek">ζ</lang> Sagittarii, or of two,
<lang n="greek">σ</lang> and <lang n="greek">ζ</lang>, only. It is probable that originally only four stars
forming a square were meant as included in the whole con-
stellation<sup>89</sup> — viz., <lang n="greek">σ</lang> and <lang n="greek">ζ</lang>, with <lang n="greek">δ</lang> and <lang n="greek">ε</lang>.
<div n="P"/>20. {@Abhijit@} is the brilliant star <lang n="greek">α</lang> Lyræ with its two com-
panions <lang n="greek">ε</lang> and <lang n="greek">ζ</lang>. Its location in 60° north latitude is completely
discordant with the position of the corresponding Arabian and
Chinese asterisms. This fact is considered by Oldenberg<sup>90</sup> to
support the view that it was a later addition to the system; its
occurrence, however, as early as the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>91</sup>
which he does not note, somewhat invalidates<sup>92</sup> that view. In
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>93</sup> Abhijit is said to be ‘over Aṣāḍhās,
under Śroṇā,’ which Weber<sup>94</sup> held to refer to its position in
space, inferring thence that its Vedic position corresponded to
that of the Arab Manāzil and the Chinese Sieou — viz., <lang n="greek">α, β</lang>
Capricorni. But Whitney<sup>95</sup> argues effectively that the words
‘over’ and ‘under’ really refer to the place of Abhijit in the
list, ‘after’ Aṣāḍhās and ‘before’ Śroṇā.
