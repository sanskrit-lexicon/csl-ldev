{@Abhri@}¦ (‘spade’) is a Vedic word<sup>1</sup> of frequent occurrence.
Various possible materials and forms are enumerated in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> It may be made of bamboo or of the wood
of Vikaṅkata or Udumbara. It may be a span or a cubit in size.
It is hollow, and either one or both edges are sharp. From
this it would appear that the handle was made of some wood,
but the head of some metal.
