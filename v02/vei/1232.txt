{@Tvac,@}¦ ‘skin,’ ‘hide,’ ({%a%}) denotes specially in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
the hide used in the process of extracting the {@Soma@} juice from
the plant. The Soma was pounded with stones ({%adri%}) upon the
skin laid on the pressing boards ({%adhiṣavaṇe phalake%}),<sup>2</sup> which,
however, are not mentioned in the Rigveda. Or if a pestle and
mortar were used, the skin was still placed underneath them
to catch the drops of juice, not above, as Pischel<sup>3</sup> thought.
[Page1-334+ 51]
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) Tvac also denotes the rind of the Soma plant that
remains after the juice has been extracted.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) Metaphorically the term {%kṛṣṇā tvac,%} ‘the black skins,’ is
applied to the aboriginal enemies of the invading Āryans.<sup>5</sup>
