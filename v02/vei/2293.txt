1. {@Bheda,@}¦ one of the enemies of {@Sudās@} and the {@Tṛtsu-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Bharatas,@} was defeated by the former in the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna),<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>apparently in a second conflict fought after the battle of the ten
<div n="lb"/>kings, in which Sudās successfully defended his western frontier
<div n="lb"/>against the confederate foes. The {@Ajas, Śigrus,@} and {@Yakṣus,@}
<div n="lb"/>who are mentioned as also defeated, may have been united
<div n="lb"/>under his leadership if he was a king; or the Bhedas may have
<div n="lb"/>been a separate people, as Roth<sup>2</sup> thinks. Hopkins'<sup>3</sup> opinion
<div n="lb"/>that the defeat was on the {@Paruṣṇī,@} Yamunā being another
[Page2-111+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>name of that stream, is most improbable; nor is the view that
<div n="lb"/>Bheda was one of the ten kings essential.<sup>4</sup> {%Cf.%} {@Turvaśa.@}
