{@Kīkaṭa.@}¦ — The name of this people occurs only in one passage
of the Rigveda, where they appear as hostile to the singer and
as under the leadership of {@Pramaganda.@} Yāska<sup>2</sup> declares that
Kīkaṭa was the name of a non-Āryan country, and later<sup>3</sup>
Kīkaṭa is given as a synonym of Magadha. Hence Zimmer<sup>4</sup>
concludes that the Kīkaṭas were a non-Āryan people living in
the country later known as Magadha. Weber<sup>5</sup> holds that this
people were located in Magadha, but were Āryan, though at
variance with other Āryan tribes, perhaps because of heretical
tendencies, for Magadha was later a seat of Buddhism. But
the identification is uncertain, and is doubted by Oldenberg<sup>6</sup>
and Hillebrandt.<sup>7</sup>
