{@Praśna@}¦ denotes generally ‘enquiry’ or ‘disputed question,’
the phrase {%praśnam eti%} having the sense ‘he asks a person for
[Page2-042+ 56]
the decision of a disputed point’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup>
and elsewhere.<sup>2</sup> Thus Praśna comes to have the definite
meaning of ‘decision in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> In the list
of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the
Yajurveda<sup>4</sup> are included the Praśnin, the Abhi-praśnin, and the
Praśna-vivāka; it is quite likely that here the three parties to a
civil case are meant — the plaintiff, the defendant, and the
arbitrator or judge ({@Madhyamaśī@}).
