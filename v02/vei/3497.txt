{@Sam-udra@}¦ (literally ‘gathering of waters’), ‘ocean,’ is a
frequent word in the Rigveda and later. It is of importance in
[Page2-432+ 60]
so far as it indicates that the Vedic Indians knew the sea.
This is, indeed, denied by Vivien de Saint Martin,<sup>1</sup> but not
only do Max Müller<sup>2</sup> and Lassen<sup>3</sup> assert it, but even Zimmer,<sup>4</sup>
who is inclined to restrict their knowledge of the sea as far as
possible, admits it in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> and of
course later.<sup>6</sup> He points out that the ebb and flow of the sea
are unknown, that the mouths of the Indus are never men-
tioned, that fish is not a known diet in the Rigveda ({%cf.%} {@Matsya@}),
and that in many places Samudra is metaphorically used, as of
the two oceans,<sup>7</sup> the lower and the upper oceans,<sup>8</sup> etc. In
other passages he thinks that Samudra denotes the river Indus
when it receives all its Panjab tributaries.<sup>9</sup> It is probable that
this is to circumscribe too narrowly the Vedic knowledge of the
ocean, which was almost inevitable to people who knew the
Indus. There are references to the treasures of the ocean,<sup>10</sup>
perhaps pearls or the gains of trade,<sup>11</sup> and the story of {@Bhujyu@}
seems to allude to marine navigation.
<div n="P"/>That there was any sea trade with Babylon in Vedic times
cannot be proved: the stress Iaid<sup>12</sup> on the occurrence in the
Hebrew Book of Kings<sup>13</sup> of {%qof%} and {%tukhiīm,%} ‘monkey’ ({%kapi%})
and ‘peacock,’ is invalidated by the doubtful date of the Book
of Kings. There is, besides, little reason to assume an early
date for the trade that no doubt developed later, perhaps
about 700 B.C.<sup>14</sup>
