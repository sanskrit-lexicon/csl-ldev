{@Māṃsa,@}¦ ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something
<div n="lb"/>quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the
<div n="lb"/>doctrine of Ahiṃsā, or abstaining from injury to animals. For
<div n="lb"/>example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods
<div n="lb"/>will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings.<sup>1</sup> Again,
<div n="lb"/>the slaying of a ‘great ox’ ({%mahokṣa%}) or a ‘great goat’ ({%mahāja%})
<div n="lb"/>for a guest was regularly prescribed;<sup>2</sup> and the name {@Atithigva@}
<div n="lb"/>probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’<sup>3</sup> The great sage
<div n="lb"/>{@Yājñavalkya@} was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and
<div n="lb"/>bullocks ({%dhenv-anaḍuha%}) if only it was {%aṃsala%} (‘firm’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘tender’).<sup>4</sup> The slaughter of a hundred bulls ({%ukṣan%}) was
<div n="lb"/>credited to one sacrificer, {@Agastya.@}<sup>5</sup> The marriage ceremony
<div n="lb"/>was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food.<sup>6</sup>
[Page2-146+ 62]
<div n="P"/>That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh
<div n="lb"/>is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a
<div n="lb"/>man is performing a vow,<sup>7</sup> or its use is disapproved, as in
<div n="lb"/>a passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> where meat is classed with
<div n="lb"/>{@Surā,@} or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>9</sup> the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the
<div n="lb"/>{@Aghās,@} a deliberate variation for {@Maghās;@} but this may be
<div n="lb"/>the outcome merely of a natural association of death with
<div n="lb"/>gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question.
<div n="lb"/>The Brāhmaṇas also contain the doctrine of the eater in this
<div n="lb"/>world being eaten in the next,<sup>10</sup> but this is not to be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it
<div n="lb"/>no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in
<div n="lb"/>harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which
<div n="lb"/>becomes marked in the Brāhmaṇas. But Ahiṃsā as a deve-
<div n="lb"/>loped and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from
<div n="lb"/>the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its
<div n="lb"/>fundamentals is later than the Brāhmaṇa period.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the
<div n="lb"/>road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> as is shown
<div n="lb"/>by the name {%aghnyā,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several
<div n="lb"/>passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that
[Page2-147+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical
<div n="lb"/>considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth
<div n="lb"/>or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of
<div n="lb"/>priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes
<div n="lb"/>than eating was so great as to account adequately for its
<div n="lb"/>sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to
<div n="lb"/>Indo-Iranian times.<sup>14</sup> Moreover, the ritual of the cremation
<div n="lb"/>of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential
<div n="lb"/>part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was
<div n="lb"/>concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims:
<div n="lb"/>what man ate he presented to the gods — that is, the sheep, the
<div n="lb"/>goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent
<div n="lb"/>exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the
<div n="lb"/>use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being
<div n="lb"/>the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use
<div n="lb"/>of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is,
<div n="lb"/>however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to
<div n="lb"/>impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to
<div n="lb"/>the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> argues.
