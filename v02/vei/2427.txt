{@Māṃsa,@}¦ ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something
quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the
doctrine of Ahiṃsā, or abstaining from injury to animals. For
example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods
will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings.<sup>1</sup> Again,
the slaying of a ‘great ox’ ({%mahokṣa%}) or a ‘great goat’ ({%mahāja%})
for a guest was regularly prescribed;<sup>2</sup> and the name {@Atithigva@}
probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’<sup>3</sup> The great sage
{@Yājñavalkya@} was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and
bullocks ({%dhenv-anaḍuha%}) if only it was {%aṃsala%} (‘firm’ or
‘tender’).<sup>4</sup> The slaughter of a hundred bulls ({%ukṣan%}) was
credited to one sacrificer, {@Agastya.@}<sup>5</sup> The marriage ceremony
was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food.<sup>6</sup>
[Page2-146+ 62]
<div n="P"/>That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh
is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a
man is performing a vow,<sup>7</sup> or its use is disapproved, as in
a passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> where meat is classed with
{@Surā,@} or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the
Rigveda<sup>9</sup> the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the
{@Aghās,@} a deliberate variation for {@Maghās;@} but this may be
the outcome merely of a natural association of death with
gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question.
The Brāhmaṇas also contain the doctrine of the eater in this
world being eaten in the next,<sup>10</sup> but this is not to be regarded
as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it
no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in
harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which
becomes marked in the Brāhmaṇas. But Ahiṃsā as a deve-
loped and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from
the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its
fundamentals is later than the Brāhmaṇa period.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the
road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> as is shown
by the name {%aghnyā,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several
passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that
[Page2-147+ 50]
meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical
considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth
or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of
priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes
than eating was so great as to account adequately for its
sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to
Indo-Iranian times.<sup>14</sup> Moreover, the ritual of the cremation
of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential
part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was
concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims:
what man ate he presented to the gods — that is, the sheep, the
goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent
exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the
use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being
the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use
of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is,
however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to
impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to
the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> argues.

blood of an animal is always a some-
what mysterious and dangerous sub-
stance; hence taboos on meat-eating,
which in another form arise from fear
of the spirits of the dead ({%cf.%} Oldenberg,
