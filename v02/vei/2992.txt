{@Viśvā-mitra@}¦ (‘friend of all’) is the name of a Ṛṣi who is
mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and to whom the third Maṇḍala is
attributed by tradition. In one hymn<sup>2</sup> which appears to be his
own composition, he praises the rivers {@Vipāś@} (Beas) and
{@Śutudrī@} (Sutlej). There he calls himself the son of {@Kuśika,@}
and seems unquestionably to be the helper of the {@Bharatas,@}
whom he mentions. The tribe, engaged in a raid, apparently
came to the rivers from the east.<sup>4</sup> Anxious to cross them, they
<div n="P"/>^3 Rv. iii. 33, 5.
[Page2-311+ 57]
found them in high flood, but Viśvāmitra by prayer induced
the waters to subside. The same feat appears to be referred
to in another passage of the same book of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup>
Curiously enough, Sāyaṇa<sup>6</sup> quite misunderstands the situation:
according to him, Viśvāmitra having obtained wealth by the
exercise of his office, went off with it to the rivers, pur-
sued by others. Yāska's<sup>7</sup> version of the tale merely seems
to mean that the king paid Viśvāmitra to act as his {@Puro-@}
{@hita,@} or domestic priest. For the relations of Viśvāmitra
to Vasiṣṭha connected with their service of {@Sudās, see@}
{@Vasiṣṭha.@}
<div n="P"/>The Viśvāmitras are mentioned in several other passages of
the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> and are also designated as a family by the term
{@Kuśikas.@}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later literature Viśvāmitra becomes, like Vasiṣṭha, a
mythical sage, usually<sup>10</sup> mentioned in connection with {@Jamad-@}
{@agni;@} he was Hotṛ priest at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} whom
he adopted, and to whom he gave the name of {@Devarāta.@}<sup>11</sup> He
was a protégé of Indra, with whom he had an interview
according to the Rigveda Āraṇyakas.<sup>12</sup> He is also often
mentioned as a Ṛṣi.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Epic<sup>14</sup> Viśvāmitra is represented as a king, who
becomes a Brahmin. There is no trace of his kingship in the
Rigveda, but the Nirukta<sup>15</sup> calls his father, Kuśika, a king; the
[Page2-312+ 52]
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> refers to Śunaḥśepa as succeeding to
the lordship of the {@Jahnus,@} as well as the ‘divine lore’ ({%daiva%}
{%veda%}) of the {@Gāthins;@} and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup>
mentions Viśvāmitra as a king. But there is no real-trace of
this kingship of Viśvāmitra: it may probably be dismissed as a
mere legend, with no more foundation at most than that Viśvā-
mitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even
this is doubtful.

as Viśvāmitra in iii. 53, 7, 12.</F>
<F>2) iii. 33. Ludwig, Translation of the
Rigveda, 3, 121, thinks the hymn too
poetical to be a real composition of the
reputed author.</F>
<F>4) So Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 3, 152.
Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 127, 128,
takes a different view: with Roth, {%Zur%}
{%Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda,%} 90,
he assumes that the Bharatas were
different from the Tṛtsus, and that they
came under Viśvāmitra from the West,
but were defeated (see Rv. vii. 33, 6).
But see Weber, {%Episches im vedischen%}

{%the American Oriental Society,%} 16, 41, 42,

Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 27, has a completely
different version, which Weber, {%Episches%}

and which omits all allusion to the
‘lordship’ of the Jahnus. This shows
how little stress can-be laid on this
late tradition.</F>
