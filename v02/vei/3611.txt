{@Su-bandhu@}¦ in the hymns of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> is taken by Sāyaṇa
to be a proper name; but this is not certain, Roth<sup>2</sup> seeing in
the passages only an ordinary noun meaning ‘a good friend.’
The later tradition<sup>3</sup> explains that Subandhu and his brothers,
called {@Gaupāyanas,@} were priests of {@Asamāti,@} who cast them off
and took two others, {@Kirāta@} and {@Ākuli.@} By these two in
pigeon form Subandhu was caused to swoon, but was revived
by his three brothers, who recited certain hymns.<sup>4</sup>
