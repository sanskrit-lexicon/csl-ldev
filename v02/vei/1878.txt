{@Puruṣanti@}¦ is a name that occurs twice in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in
the first passage denoting a protégé of the Aśvins, in the second
a patron who gave presents to one of the Vedic singers. In
both cases the name is joined with that of {@Dhvasanti@} or
{@Dhvasra.@} The presumption from the manner in which these
three names are mentioned is that they designate men, but the
grammatical form of the words might equally well be feminine.
Females must be meant, if the evidence of the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> is to be taken as decisive, for the form of the first
of the two names there occurring, {%Dhvasre Puruṣantī,%} ‘Dhvasrā
and Puruṣanti,’ is exclusively feminine, though {@here@} as well as
elsewhere Sāyaṇa<sup>3</sup> interprets the names as masculines. See
also {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḷha.@}

<F>2) xiii. 7, 12. Roth thinks the feminine
form {%Dhvasre%} here is a corruption, based
on the dual form occurring in the
Rigveda, {%Dhvasrayoḥ,%} which might be
feminine as well as masculine.</F>
