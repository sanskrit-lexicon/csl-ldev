{@Puruṣanti@}¦ is a name that occurs twice in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>the first passage denoting a protégé of the Aśvins, in the second
<div n="lb"/>a patron who gave presents to one of the Vedic singers. In
<div n="lb"/>both cases the name is joined with that of {@Dhvasanti@} or
<div n="lb"/>{@Dhvasra.@} The presumption from the manner in which these
<div n="lb"/>three names are mentioned is that they designate men, but the
<div n="lb"/>grammatical form of the words might equally well be feminine.
<div n="lb"/>Females must be meant, if the evidence of the Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> is to be taken as decisive, for the form of the first
<div n="lb"/>of the two names there occurring, {%Dhvasre Puruṣantī,%} ‘Dhvasrā
<div n="lb"/>and Puruṣanti,’ is exclusively feminine, though {@here@} as well as
<div n="lb"/>elsewhere Sāyaṇa<sup>3</sup> interprets the names as masculines. See
<div n="lb"/>also {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḷha.@}
<F>1) i. 112, 23; ix. 58, 3.</F>
<F>2) xiii. 7, 12. Roth thinks the feminine
<div n="lb"/>form {%Dhvasre%} here is a corruption, based
<div n="lb"/>on the dual form occurring in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, {%Dhvasrayoḥ,%} which might be
<div n="lb"/>feminine as well as masculine.</F>
