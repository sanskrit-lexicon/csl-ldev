{@Aulāna@}¦ is a word occurring in a single passage of the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it may possibly be a patronymic of {@Śaṃtanu@}
as a ‘descendant of Ula.’ Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> however, conjectures that
the reading should be ‘Kaulāna.’ Sieg<sup>3</sup> regards Aulāna as
a later descendant<sup>4</sup> of Śaṃtanu, who utilized the story of
Devāpi's rain-making as an introduction to his rain hymn.
