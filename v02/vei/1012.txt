{@Jani, Janī.@}¦ — These words appear to denote ‘wife,’ usually
applying to her in relation to her husband ({@Pati@}). The more
general sense of ‘woman’ is doubtful; for when Uṣas is called
a fair {@Janī,@}<sup>1</sup> ‘wife’ may be meant, and the other passage<sup>2</sup> cited
for this sense by Delbrück,<sup>3</sup> which refers to the begetting of
children, seems to demand the sense of ‘wives.’ Since the
words usually appear in the plural,<sup>4</sup> it is possible they may
[Page1-275+ 45]
refer not to ‘wives’ proper, but to Hetairai. This is, how-
ever, rendered unlikely because the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> uses the phrase
{%patyur janitvam,%} denoting ‘wifehood to a husband,’ as well
as the expression {%janayo na patnīḥ,%}<sup>6</sup> ‘like wives (who are)
mistresses,’<sup>7</sup> besides containing passages in which the word has
reference to marriage.<sup>8</sup> The singular occurs in the dialogue of
Yama and Yamī.<sup>9</sup>

<F>7) The distinction of sense was prob-
ably this: {%jani%} meant ‘wife,’ as bearing
children (from {%jan,%} ‘beget’), while
{%patnī%} was ‘wife,’ as being mistress
of the house (feminine of {%pati,%} ‘lord,’
‘husband’).</F>
