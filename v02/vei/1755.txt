{@Pāka-dūrvā@}¦ is, in a verse of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> included with
{@Kiyāmbu@} and {@Vyalkaśā@} among the plants used for growing on
the spot where the corpse of the dead man has been consumed
with fire.<sup>2</sup> The verse is repeated in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>3</sup>
[Page1-514+ 38]
with the variant Kyāmbu. In the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the word is
read Śāṇḍadūrvā. Pākadūrvā is probably, as Sāyaṇa-under-
stands it, {%paripakva-dūrvā,%} ‘ripe or edible millet.’ Śāṇḍadūrvā
is explained by the commentator<sup>5</sup> in various ways, as millet
‘having egg-shaped roots’ ({%i.e., sāṇḍa,%} not {%śāṇḍa%}), or as ‘having
long joints,’ with the additional remark that it was called {%bṛhad-%}
{%dūrvā,%} ‘large millet.’ In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, on the other
hand, the commentary explains Pākadūrvā as small millet.
