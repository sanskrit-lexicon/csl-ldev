{@Nada@}¦ is found in several passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but its
<div n="lb"/>sense is still obscure. It is identified by Pischel<sup>2</sup> with {@Naḍa,@}
<div n="lb"/>being explained by him in one passage<sup>3</sup> as a reed boat, which
<div n="lb"/>is split, and over which the waters go; in another<sup>4</sup> as a reed
<div n="lb"/>whip, of which the sharp points ({%karṇa%}) are used to urge horses
<div n="lb"/>on; and in others<sup>5</sup> again as figuratively designating the penis.
<div n="lb"/>Roth<sup>6</sup> takes the sense to be ‘bull’ (either literally or meta-
[Page1-434+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>phorically) in all passages. Once at least<sup>7</sup> the ‘neigher’ (from
<div n="lb"/>the root {%nad,%} ‘sound’) seems to be meant with reference to
<div n="lb"/>Indra's horse. In the phrase {%nadasya karṇaiḥ%}^8 the sense is,
<div n="lb"/>perhaps, ‘through the ears of the (side) horse’ (that is, by their
<div n="lb"/>being ready to hear the word of command) of their chariot,
<div n="lb"/>the Maruts ‘hasten on with their swift steeds’ ({%turayanta%}
<div n="lb"/>{%āśubhiḥ%}).

<div n="lb"/>‘sharp,’ with {%karṇaiḥ%} as Pischel does

<F>6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.%} The
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘bull’ seems imperative in
<div n="lb"/>viii. 89, 2; it is admissible in i. 179, 4,
<div n="lb"/>where ‘bull’ may denote a man, and
<div n="lb"/>in x. 11, 2, and possibly in i. 32, 8,
<div n="lb"/>but ‘reed’ there seems far more likely.</F>
<F>7) x. 105, 4. and in x. 11, 2. The
