{@Citra-ratha@}¦ (‘having a brilliant car’) is the name of two
<div n="lb"/>persons.
<div n="P"/>({%a%}) It designates an Āryan prince, who, with Arṇa, was
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Indra for the Turvaśa-Yadus on the {@Sarayu@} (per-
<div n="lb"/>haps the modern Sarju in Oudh), according to the Rigveda (iv.
<div n="lb"/>30, 18). The locality would accord with the close connexion
<div n="lb"/>of Turvaśa and {@Krivi@} or {@Pañcāla.@}
[Page1-262+ 46]
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) Citraratha is also the name of a king for whom the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kāpeyas@} performed a special kind of sacrifice ({%dvirātra%}), with
<div n="lb"/>the result, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> that in the
<div n="lb"/>Caitrarathi family only one member was a Kṣatra-pati, the rest
<div n="lb"/>dependents. Apparently this must mean that the Caitrarathis
<div n="lb"/>were distinguished from other families of princes by the fact
<div n="lb"/>that the chief of the clan received a markedly higher position
<div n="lb"/>than in most cases, in which probably the heads of the family
<div n="lb"/>were rather an oligarchy than a monarch and his dependents.
