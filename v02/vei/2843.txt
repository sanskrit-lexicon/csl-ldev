{@Vasiṣṭha@}¦ is the name of one of the most prominent priestly
figures of Vedic tradition. The seventh Maṇḍala of the
Rigveda is ascribed to him; this ascription is borne out by the
fact that the Vasiṣṭhas<sup>1</sup> and Vasiṣṭha<sup>2</sup> are frequently mentioned
in that Maṇḍala, besides being sometimes referred to elsewhere.
That by the name Vasiṣṭha a definite individual is always
meant is most improbable, as Oldenberg<sup>3</sup> shows; Vasiṣṭha
must normally mean simply ‘a Vasiṣṭha.’ But it is not
necessary to deny that a real Vasiṣṭha existed, for one hymn<sup>4</sup>
seems to show clear traces of his authorship, and of his assist-
ance to {@Sudās@} against the ten kings.
<div n="P"/>The most important feature of Vasiṣṭha's life was apparently
[Page2-275+ 68]
his hostility to {@Viśvāmitra.@} The latter was certainly<sup>5</sup> at one
time the {@Purohita@} (‘domestic priest’) of Sudās, but he seems
to have been deposed from that post, to have joined Sudās'
enemies, and to have taken part in the onslaught of the kings
against him, for the hymn of Sudās' triumph<sup>4</sup> has clear
references to the ruin Viśvāmitra brought on his allies.<sup>6</sup>
Oldenberg,<sup>7</sup> however, holds that the strife of Viśvāmitra and
Vasiṣṭha is not to be found in the Rigveda. On the other
hand, Geldner<sup>8</sup> is hardly right in finding in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> a
compressed account indicating the rivalry of {@Śakti,@} Vasiṣṭha's
son, with Viśvāmitra, the acquisition by Viśvāmitra of special
skill in speech, and the revenge of Viśvāmitra, who secured the
death of Śakti by Sudās' servants, an account which is more
fully related by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya,<sup>10</sup> which appeared in the Śāṭyāya-
naka,<sup>11</sup> and to which reference seems to be made in the brief
notices of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>12</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa<sup>13</sup> regarding Vasiṣṭha's sons having been slain, and his
overcoming the Saudāsas. But it is important to note that no
mention is made in these authorities of Sudās himself being
actually opposed to Vasiṣṭha, while in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup>
Vasiṣṭha appears as the Purohita and consecrator of Sudās
Paijavana. Yāska<sup>15</sup> recognizes Viśvāmitra as the Purohita of
Sudās; this accords with what seems to have been the fact
[Page2-276+ 63]
that Viśvāmitra originally held the post. Probably, however,
with the disappearance of Sudās, Viśvāmitra recovered his
position, whereupon Vasiṣṭha in revenge for the murder of
his sons secured in some way unspecified the defeat of the
Saudāsas.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>At any rate it is hardly necessary to suppose that the enmity
of the Saudāsas and Vasiṣṭhas was permanent. There is
evidence<sup>17</sup> that the Bharatas had the Vasiṣṭhas as Purohitas,
while other versions<sup>18</sup> regard them as Purohitas for people
({%prajāḥ%}) generally. It seems that the Vasiṣṭhas were pioneers
in adopting the rule that Purohitas should act as Brahman
priest<sup>19</sup> at the sacrifice: the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> states that
the Vasiṣṭhas were once the only priests to act as Brahmans,
but that later any priest could serve as such.<sup>21</sup> A rivalry
with Jamadgni and Viśvāmitra is reported in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā.<sup>22</sup> Parāśara and Śatayātu are associated with Vasiṣṭha
in the Rigveda,<sup>23</sup> being apparently, as Geldner<sup>24</sup> thinks, the
grandson and a son of Vasiṣṭha. According to Pischel,<sup>25</sup> in
another hymn,<sup>26</sup> Vasiṣṭha appears as attempting to steal the
goods of his father Varuṇa; Geldner<sup>27</sup> also shows that the
Rigveda<sup>28</sup> contains a clear reference to Vasiṣṭha's being a son
of Varuṇa and the nymph Urvaśī. Perhaps this explains the
fact that the Vasiṣṭhas are called the {@Tṛtsus@} in one passage
[Page2-277+ 52]
of the Rigveda;<sup>29</sup> for being of miraculous parentage, Vasiṣṭha
would need adoption into a Gotra, that of the princes whom
he served, and to whom Agastya seems to have introduced
him.
<div n="P"/>There are numerous other references to Vasiṣṭha as a Ṛṣi
in Vedic literature,<sup>30</sup> in the Sūtras,<sup>31</sup> and in the Epic, where
he and Viśvāmitra fight out their rivalry.<sup>32</sup>

complicated the question by regarding
the Bharatas as enemies of the Tṛtsus,
