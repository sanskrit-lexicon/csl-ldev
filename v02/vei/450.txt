2. {@Etaśa@}¦ is in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> the name of a sage
who is said to have cursed his children because they interrupted
him in the midst of a rite; hence the Aitaśāyanas (descendants
of Etaśa) are declared to be the worst of the Bhṛgus. The
same story appears in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā<sup>2</sup> where, how-
ever, the sage's name is Aitaśa, and the Aitaśāyanas are
described as the worst of the Aurvas.
