{@Aty-arāti Jānaṃ-tapi,@}¦ though not a prince, was taught the
Rājasūya by {@Vāsiṣṭha Satyahavya,@} and thereupon conquered
the earth. When Vāsiṣṭha reminded him of his indebtedness,
and claimed a great reward, the warrior replied irascibly that
he intended to conquer the {@Uttara Kurus,@} and that Vāsiṣṭha
would then become King of the Earth, Atyarāti himself being
his general ({%senā-pati%}). Vāsiṣṭha replied that as no mortal man
could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward.

He consequently procured Atyarāti's defeat and death at the
hands of {@Amitratapana Śuṣmiṇa Śaibya.@}<sup>1</sup>
