{@Rājanya-bandhu@}¦ denotes a Rājanya, but usually with a
depreciating sense. Thus in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> {@Janaka@}
is called by the Brahmins, whom he defeated in disputation, ‘a
fellow of a Rājanya’; the same description is applied to {@Pravāh-@}
{@aṇa Jaivali@} in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> for a similar
reason. On the other hand, in one passage<sup>3</sup> where reference is
made to men eating apart from women, princes are said to do
so most of all: the term Rājanyabandhu cannot here be
deemed to be contemptuous, unless, indeed, it is the expression
of Brahmin contempt for princes, such as clearly appears in
the treatment of {@Nagnajit@} in another passage.<sup>4</sup> Again, in a
passage<sup>5</sup> in which the four castes are mentioned, the {@Vaiśya@}
precedes the Rājanyabandhu, a curious inversion of the order
of the second and third castes.<sup>6</sup>
