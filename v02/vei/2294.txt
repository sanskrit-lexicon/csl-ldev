2. {@Bheda@}¦ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as having come
<div n="lb"/>to a bad end because he refused a cow ({%vaśā%}) to Indra when
<div n="lb"/>asked for it. That he is different from the preceding Bheda, as
<div n="lb"/>Roth<sup>2</sup> assumes, is not certain. Indeed, it may very well be
<div n="lb"/>that his defeat led to his being chosen as the representative of
<div n="lb"/>the evil end of the wicked man. Moreover, the irreligious
<div n="lb"/>character of Bheda may be ascribed to his being a leader of
<div n="lb"/>non-Āryan folk, if the {@Ajas@} and {@Śigrus,@} with whom in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda he is connected or associated were, as is possible,
<div n="lb"/>though by no means certain, un-Āryan tribes of totemists.<sup>3</sup>
