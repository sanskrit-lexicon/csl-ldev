{@Kāru,@}¦ ‘poet,’ is a word almost confined to the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There is evidence that the poet was regarded as a professional
<div n="lb"/>man, just as much as the physician ({@Bhiṣaj@}).<sup>2</sup> The poets, no
<div n="lb"/>doubt, mainly lived at the courts of princes amid their re-
<div n="lb"/>tainers,<sup>3</sup> though they would probably also sing the praises of rich
<div n="lb"/>merchants. There was probably no essential connexion between
<div n="lb"/>the priest and the poet. Though the priest was often a poet,
<div n="lb"/>yet poetry can hardly have been restricted to the priestly caste.
<div n="lb"/>Indeed, at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> expressly requires that one of the singers of pane-
<div n="lb"/>gyrics should be a Rājanya, while the other was a Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>both singing verses of their own composition. The Anukra-
<div n="lb"/>maṇī (Index) in several cases<sup>5</sup> attributes hymns of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>to princes; and even though this may often be merely the
<div n="lb"/>same sort of procedure<sup>6</sup> as has made Śūdraka the author of
<div n="lb"/>the Mṛcchakaṭikā, or Harṣa of the Ratnāvalī, and has given
<div n="lb"/>us royal teachers of the Brahman doctrine,<sup>7</sup> still the Indian
<div n="lb"/>tradition evidently saw nothing odd in the idea of non-
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas as poets. Most of the non-sacred poetry has,

<div n="lb"/>however, disappeared, for the epic is a product, as it stands,
<div n="lb"/>of a later period. See also {@Ṛṣi.@}
