{@Upa-niṣad@}¦ in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup> normally denotes the ‘secret
sense’ of some word or text, sometimes the ‘secret rule’ of the
mendicant. But in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> it is already
used in the plural as the designation of a class of writings, no
doubt actually existing and similar to the Upaniṣads in the
nature of their subject-matter and its treatment. Similarly
the sections of the Taittirīya Upaniṣad end with the words
{%ity upaniṣad.%} The Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>3</sup> commences its third
part with the title ‘The Upaniṣad of the Saṃhitā,’ and the
title occurs also in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.<sup>4</sup> The exact
primary sense of the expression is doubtful. The natural
derivation, adopted by Max Müller<sup>5</sup> and usual ever since,
makes the word mean firstly a session of pupils, hence secret
doctrine, and secondly the title of a work on secret doctrine.
Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> however, traces the use of the word to the earlier
[Page1-092+ 42]
sense of ‘worship’ ({%cf. upāsana%}). Deussen<sup>7</sup> considers the
original sense to have been ‘secret word,’ next ‘secret text,’
and then ‘secret import,’ but this order of meaning is im-
probable. Hopkins<sup>8</sup> suggests that Upaniṣad denotes a sub-
sidiary treatise, but this sense does not account naturally for
the common use as ‘secret meaning,’ which is far more
frequent than any other.
