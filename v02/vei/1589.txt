{@Ni-ṣāda@}¦ is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup>
The word seems to denote not so much a particular tribe, but
to be the general term for the non-Āryan tribes who were not
under Āryan control, as the Śūdras were, for Aupamanyava<sup>2</sup>
took the five peoples ({%pañca janāḥ%}) to be the four castes ({%catvāro%}
[Page1-454+ 56]
{%varṇāḥ%}) and the Niṣādas, and the commentator Mahīdhara
explains the word where it occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
as meaning a Bhilla, or Bhīl. A village of Niṣādas is men-
tioned in the Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>4</sup> and a Niṣāda {@Sthapati,@}
a leader of some kind, is referred to in the Kātyāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>5</sup> and in a Brāhmaṇa cited by the scholiast on that
passage. Weber<sup>6</sup> thinks that the Niṣādas were the settled
aborigines (form {%ni,%} ‘down,’ and {%sad,%} ‘settle’), a view sup-
ported by the fact that the ritual of the Viśvajit sacrifice<sup>7</sup>
requires a temporary residence with Niṣādas; for the Niṣādas
who would permit an Āryan to reside temporarily amongst
them must have been partially amenable to Āryan influence.
But the name might easily be applied to the whole body of
aborigines outside the Āryan organization. Von Schroeder<sup>8</sup>
thinks that the Niṣādas were most probably identical with the
Nysæans, who, according to the Greek account, sent an
embassy to Alexander when he was in the territory of the
Aśvakas, but this identification is doubtful.

the Niṣāda is the offspring of a Brāh-
maṇa and of a Śūdra woman, while the
Bṛhatsaṃhitā of Varāhamihira (xiv. 10)
recognizes a kingdom ({%rāṣṭra%}) of Niṣādas
in the south-east of Madhyadeśa. In the
Pāli texts (Fick, {%Die sociale Gliederung,%}
