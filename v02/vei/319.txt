1. {@Ibha@}¦ is a word of somewhat doubtful sense and inter-
pretation. It is found only in the Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup> and especially in
the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> According to Roth<sup>3</sup> and Ludwig<sup>4</sup> the sense is
‘retainer,’ and Zimmer<sup>5</sup> thinks that it includes not only
dependants and servants, but also the royal family and the
youthful cadets of the chief families. In the opinion of Pischel
and Geldner<sup>6</sup> it denotes ‘elephant.’ This view is supported
by the authority of the commentators Sāyaṇa<sup>7</sup> and Mahīdhara;<sup>8</sup>
the Nirukta,<sup>9</sup> too, gives ‘elephant’ as one of the senses of the
word. Megasthenes<sup>10</sup> and Nearchos<sup>11</sup> tell us that elephants
were a royal prerogative, and the derivative word {@Ibhya@} may
thus be naturally explained as denoting merely ‘rich’ (lit.,
‘possessor of elephants’).<sup>12</sup>

of the primary word: ‘possessor of
