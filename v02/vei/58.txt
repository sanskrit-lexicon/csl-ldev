{@Adhi-ṣavaṇa.@}¦ — The two Adhiṣavaṇas<sup>1</sup> are usually understood,
as by Roth<sup>2</sup> and Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> to designate the two boards between
which the Soma was pressed. Hillebrandt,<sup>4</sup> however, shows
from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the
other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving
as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone.
This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense
of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as
an adjective (‘used for pressing {%upon%}’). But according to the
procedure as witnessed by Haug<sup>5</sup> in the Deccan, the shoots of
the plant are first placed on the skin, one of the boards being
then laid over them and pounded with a stone. The shoots
are then taken out and placed upon the board, the second
board being then laid over them.
