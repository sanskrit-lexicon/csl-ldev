{@Adhi-ṣavaṇa.@}¦ — The two Adhiṣavaṇas<sup>1</sup> are usually understood,
<div n="lb"/>as by Roth<sup>2</sup> and Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> to designate the two boards between
<div n="lb"/>which the Soma was pressed. Hillebrandt,<sup>4</sup> however, shows
<div n="lb"/>from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the
<div n="lb"/>other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving
<div n="lb"/>as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone.
<div n="lb"/>This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense
<div n="lb"/>of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as
<div n="lb"/>an adjective (‘used for pressing {%upon%}’). But according to the
<div n="lb"/>procedure as witnessed by Haug<sup>5</sup> in the Deccan, the shoots of
<div n="lb"/>the plant are first placed on the skin, one of the boards being
<div n="lb"/>then laid over them and pounded with a stone. The shoots
<div n="lb"/>are then taken out and placed upon the board, the second
<div n="lb"/>board being then laid over them.
