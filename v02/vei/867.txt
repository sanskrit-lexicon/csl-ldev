{@Gāthin@}¦ is mentioned as the son of {@Kuśika@} and father of
{@Viśvāmitra@} in the Sarvānukramaṇī. It is difficult to say
whether this tradition is correct; it derives some support from
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 18), where reference is made to
the divine lore ({%daiva veda%}) of the Gāthins, which is said to be
shared by {@Śunaḥśepa@} as a result of his adoption by {@Viśvāmitra.@}
