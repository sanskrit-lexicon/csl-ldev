{@Sadā-nīrā,@}¦ ‘having water always’ (‘perennial’), is the name
of a stream which, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> was
the boundary between the {@Kosalas@} and the {@Videhas.@} The
river is identified by the native lexicographers with the Kara-
toyā,<sup>2</sup> but this seems to be too far east. Weber's<sup>3</sup> identification
[Page2-422+ 34]
of it with the Gaṇḍakī<sup>4</sup> is probably correct; for though the
Mahābhārata<sup>5</sup> distinguishes the two rivers, there is nothing to
show that this is due to any good tradition.
