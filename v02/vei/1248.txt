{@Daṇḍa,@}¦ ‘staff.’ ({%a%}) This word is often mentioned in the
ordinary sense; for example, when used for driving cattle<sup>1</sup>
({%go-ajanāsaḥ%}), or as a weapon.<sup>2</sup> A staff was given to a man
on consecration for driving away demons, according to the
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> The staff also played a part in the
initiation ({%upanayana%}) of a youth on attaining manhood.<sup>4</sup> In
a modified sense the word is used to denote the handle of a
ladle or similar implement.<sup>5</sup>
[Page1-338+ 49]
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The ‘staff’ as the symbol of temporal power, implying
punishment, is applied by the king ({%rāja-preṣito daṇḍaḥ%}).<sup>1</sup> The
king, in modern phraseology, was the source of criminal law;
and he clearly retained this branch of law in his own hands
even in later times.<sup>2</sup> The punishment of the non-guilty
({%a-daṇḍya%}) is given as one of the characteristics of the non-
Brahminical {@Vrātyas@} in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> See
also {@Dharma.@}
