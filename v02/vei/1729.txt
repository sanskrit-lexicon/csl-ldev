4. {@Parśu@}¦ occurs in one passage in a Dānastuti (‘praise of
gifts’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the name of a man. It is not certain
that he is identical with {@Tirindira,@} but the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>2</sup> mentions Tirindira Pāraśavya as the patron of {@Vatsa@}
{@Kāṇva.@} In another passage occurring in the Vṛṣākapi hymn,<sup>3</sup>
Parśu Mānavī occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of
Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting
these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has
with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>Ludwig,<sup>4</sup> however, sees in several other places an allusion to
the Parśus. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> he finds a
reference to the defeat of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} by the Parśus; in
another<sup>6</sup> he finds a reference to the Pṛthus and Parśus — {%i.e.,%} the
Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in
{@Pārthava,@} a name found in one hymn.<sup>7</sup> The same view is
taken by Weber,<sup>8</sup> who holds that historical connexions with the
[Page1-505+ 38]
Persians are referred to. But Zimmer<sup>9</sup> points out that this
conclusion is not justified; the Parśus were known to Pāṇini<sup>10</sup>
as a warrior tribe; the Pāraśavas were a tribe in south-west
{@Madhyadeśa;@} and the {%Periplus%}<sup>11</sup> knows a tribe of Parthoi in
north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that
the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of
course the case. Actual historical contact cannot be asserted
with any degree of probability.

<F>3) x. 86, 23. Apparently Vārttika 2,
on Pāṇini, iv. 1, 177, where Parśu is
explained as a feminine, Princess of
the Parśus, refers to this passage. On
the sense, {%cf.%} Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%}
2, 42; {%Rigveda, Glossar,%} 107; and Tait-
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 2, where the
expression occurs, but where the sense
is very dubious.</F>

doubt, ‘ribs.’ See Geldner, {%op. cit.,%} 2,

really means either ‘with large ribs’ —

inclines to take it — or ‘with broad axes,’
according to Zimmer.</F>

{%Ritual,%} 36 {%et seq.%} He confines his view
to the equation of Parśu in Rigveda,
viii. 6, 46, and the Persians. Hille-
brandt, who is inclined to see relations
with Iran in early times (see {@Paṇi,@}
{@Pārāvata, Sṛñjaya@}), does not in this
connexion quote Parśu at all, and,
though he mentions Pārthava, does not
regard it as probably referring to a
Parthian ({%Vedische Mythologie,%} 1, 105).
Brunnhofer, in his various works ({%Iran%}
{%und Turan,%} 1889; {%vom Pontus bis zum%}
{%Indus,%} 1890, etc.), finds constant refer-
ences in the Veda to events in Iran,
but his theories must be regarded as
definitely unscientific. See also Hop-
kins, {%Journal of the American Oriental%}

{%Ibid.,%} 434, 435, he refutes conclusively
Ludwig's extraordinary view that Pṛthu
and Parśu are dialectical forms of the
same word.</F>
