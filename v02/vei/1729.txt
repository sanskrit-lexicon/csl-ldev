4. {@Parśu@}¦ occurs in one passage in a Dānastuti (‘praise of
<div n="lb"/>gifts’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the name of a man. It is not certain
<div n="lb"/>that he is identical with {@Tirindira,@} but the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra<sup>2</sup> mentions Tirindira Pāraśavya as the patron of {@Vatsa@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Kāṇva.@} In another passage occurring in the Vṛṣākapi hymn,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Parśu Mānavī occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting
<div n="lb"/>these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has
<div n="lb"/>with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>Ludwig,<sup>4</sup> however, sees in several other places an allusion to
<div n="lb"/>the Parśus. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> he finds a
<div n="lb"/>reference to the defeat of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} by the Parśus; in
<div n="lb"/>another<sup>6</sup> he finds a reference to the Pṛthus and Parśus — {%i.e.,%} the
<div n="lb"/>Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in
<div n="lb"/>{@Pārthava,@} a name found in one hymn.<sup>7</sup> The same view is
<div n="lb"/>taken by Weber,<sup>8</sup> who holds that historical connexions with the
[Page1-505+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>Persians are referred to. But Zimmer<sup>9</sup> points out that this
<div n="lb"/>conclusion is not justified; the Parśus were known to Pāṇini<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as a warrior tribe; the Pāraśavas were a tribe in south-west
<div n="lb"/>{@Madhyadeśa;@} and the {%Periplus%}<sup>11</sup> knows a tribe of Parthoi in
<div n="lb"/>north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that
<div n="lb"/>the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of
<div n="lb"/>course the case. Actual historical contact cannot be asserted
<div n="lb"/>with any degree of probability.

<div n="lb"/>on Pāṇini, iv. 1, 177, where Parśu is
<div n="lb"/>explained as a feminine, Princess of
<div n="lb"/>the Parśus, refers to this passage. On
<div n="lb"/>the sense, {%cf.%} Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%}
<div n="lb"/>2, 42; {%Rigveda, Glossar,%} 107; and Tait-
<div n="lb"/>tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 2, where the
<div n="lb"/>expression occurs, but where the sense
<div n="lb"/>is very dubious.</F>

<div n="lb"/>inclines to take it — or ‘with broad axes,’
<div n="lb"/>according to Zimmer.</F>

<div n="lb"/>{%Literature,%} 4; {%Episches im vedischen%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Ritual,%} 36 {%et seq.%} He confines his view
<div n="lb"/>to the equation of Parśu in Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>viii. 6, 46, and the Persians. Hille-
<div n="lb"/>brandt, who is inclined to see relations
<div n="lb"/>with Iran in early times (see {@Paṇi,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Pārāvata, Sṛñjaya@}), does not in this
<div n="lb"/>connexion quote Parśu at all, and,
<div n="lb"/>though he mentions Pārthava, does not
<div n="lb"/>regard it as probably referring to a
<div n="lb"/>Parthian ({%Vedische Mythologie,%} 1, 105).
<div n="lb"/>Brunnhofer, in his various works ({%Iran%}
<div n="lb"/>{%und Turan,%} 1889; {%vom Pontus bis zum%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Indus,%} 1890, etc.), finds constant refer-
<div n="lb"/>ences in the Veda to events in Iran,
<div n="lb"/>but his theories must be regarded as
<div n="lb"/>definitely unscientific. See also Hop-

<div n="lb"/>{%Ibid.,%} 434, 435, he refutes conclusively
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig's extraordinary view that Pṛthu
<div n="lb"/>and Parśu are dialectical forms of the
<div n="lb"/>same word.</F>
