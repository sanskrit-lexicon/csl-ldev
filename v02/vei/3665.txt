{@Senā-nī,@}¦ ‘leader of an army,’ is the title of the royal
‘general.’ He is mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where also<sup>2</sup> the
word is used metaphorically. He is also referred to in the
Śatarudriya,<sup>3</sup> as well as elsewhere in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās and
Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup> He is one of the {@Ratnins@} of the king.<sup>5</sup> Presum-
ably he was appointed by the king, not by the people, to
command in war when the king became too important to lead
every little fray in person. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> this
official is called Senā-pati.
