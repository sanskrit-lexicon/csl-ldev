<L>677<pc>1-176<k1>कूचक्र<k2>कूचक्र
{@Kūcakra@}¦ is a word occurring only once in an obscure verse
of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where Zimmer<sup>2</sup> suggests that it has the sense
of the wheel by which water is raised from a well. Much
more probable is the interpretation of Roth,<sup>3</sup> who understands
it to mean the female breast.
