{@Vājapeya@}¦ is the name of a ceremony which, according to
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and later authorities,<sup>2</sup> is only per-
<div n="lb"/>formed by a Brahmin or a Kṣatriya. The same Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>insists that this sacrifice is superior to the {@Rājasūya,@} but the
<div n="lb"/>consensus of other authorities<sup>4</sup> assigns to it merely the place
<div n="lb"/>of a preliminary to the {@Bṛhaspatisava@} in the case of a priest,
<div n="lb"/>and to the {@Rājasūya@} in the case of a king, while the Śatapatha<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>is compelled to identify the Bṛhaspatisava with the Vājapeya.
<div n="lb"/>The essential ceremony is a chariot race in which the sacrificer
<div n="lb"/>is victorious. There is evidence in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra<sup>6</sup> showing that once the festival was one which any
<div n="lb"/>Āryan could perform. Hillebrandt,<sup>7</sup> indeed, goes so far as to
<div n="lb"/>compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much
<div n="lb"/>real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed
<div n="lb"/>round a primitive habit of chariot racing, transformed into
<div n="lb"/>a ceremony which by sympathetic magic secures the success
<div n="lb"/>of the sacrificer. In fact<sup>8</sup> Eggeling seems correct in holding
<div n="lb"/>that the Vājapeya was a preliminary rite performed by a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin prior to his formal installation as a Purohita, or by
<div n="lb"/>a king prior to his consecration. The Kuru Vājapeya was
<div n="lb"/>specially well known.<sup>9</sup>
