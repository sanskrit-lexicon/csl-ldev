{@Proti Kauśāmbeya Kausuru-bindi@}¦ (‘descendant of {@Kusuru-@}
{@binda@}’) is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> as a pupil
and contemporary of {@Uddālaka.@} In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>2</sup> on
the other hand, Kusurubinda is called {@Auddālaki,@} ‘descendant
of Uddālaka,’ a fact which seems to indicate that little value
is to be attached to these patronymics and allegations of
contemporaneousness.
