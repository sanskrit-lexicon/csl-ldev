{@Śaryaṇāvant@}¦ occurs in several passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>all of which Sāyaṇa sees a local name. According to his
<div n="lb"/>account, Śaryaṇāḥ (masc. plur.) is a district in {@Kurukṣetra,@}
<div n="lb"/>Śaryaṇāvant being a lake not far from it in the back part
<div n="lb"/>({%jaghanārdhe%}) of Kurukṣetra. The unusual consistency of his
<div n="lb"/>statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place
<div n="lb"/>name; it is also to be noted that Kurukṣetra contained the
<div n="lb"/>lake {@Anyataḥplakṣā.@} Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, thought that in two
<div n="lb"/>passages<sup>3</sup> the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water)
<div n="lb"/>covered with a thicket of reeds’ ({%śaryaṇa%}), and in the others a
<div n="lb"/>Soma vessel. Zimmer<sup>4</sup> inclines to this rendering. On the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, Pischel<sup>5</sup> accepts Sāyaṇa's view. Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> also
<div n="lb"/>sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it
<div n="lb"/>among the ‘five tribes,’<sup>7</sup> which is not quite inconsistent with its
<div n="lb"/>being in Kurukṣetra, for the connexion of the {@Pūrus@} with the
<div n="lb"/>later {@Kurus@} is known;<sup>8</sup> or perhaps, he suggests, Śaryaṇāvant
<div n="lb"/>is an old name for the Wular sea of Kaśmīr, which was only a
<div n="lb"/>reminiscence in Vedic times. This is not probable; still less
<div n="lb"/>so is Ludwig's hypothesis<sup>9</sup> that the Śaryaṇāvant is the later
<div n="lb"/>eastern {@Sarasvatī.@} Bergaigne<sup>10</sup> regards the name as that of
<div n="lb"/>a celestial preparer of Soma.
