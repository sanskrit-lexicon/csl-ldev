{@Pitṛ,@}¦ common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’
not so much as the ‘begetter’ ({%janitṛ%}),<sup>1</sup> but rather as the pro-
tector of the child, this being probably also the etymological
sense of the word.<sup>2</sup> The father in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> stands for all
that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father,<sup>4</sup>
while Indra is even dearer than a father.<sup>5</sup> The father carries
his son in his arms,<sup>6</sup> and places him on his lap,<sup>7</sup> while the child
pulls his garment to attract attention.<sup>8</sup> In later years the son
depends on his father for help in trouble,<sup>9</sup> and greets him
with joy.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was
subject to parental control, and how long such control con-
tinued. Reference is made in the Rigveda<sup>11</sup> to a father's
chastising his son for gambling, and {@Ṛjrāśva@} is said to have
been blinded by his father.<sup>12</sup> From the latter statement
Zimmer<sup>13</sup> infers the existence of a developed {%patria potestas,%} but
to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would
be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the {%patria potestas%}
was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis
in the Roman {%patria potestas.%} If there is no proof that a father
[Page1-527+ 59]
legally controlled his son's wedding,<sup>14</sup> and not much that he
controlled his daughter's,<sup>15</sup> the fact is in itself not im-
probable.
<div n="P"/>There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when
grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife
becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he
set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor
do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land
on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such
property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate
of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor
and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact
that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property,<sup>16</sup>
or he might divide it amongst them,<sup>17</sup> and that when the
father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's
wife.<sup>18</sup> There are also obscure traces that in old age a father
might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that
this was usual in Vedic India.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience.<sup>20</sup>
The later Sūtras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he
owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his
father's food.<sup>21</sup> On the other hand, the father was expected
to be kind. The story of {@Śunaḥśepa@} in the Aitareya Brāh-
[Page1-528+ 58]
maṇa<sup>22</sup> emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless
treatment of his son was viewed. The Upaniṣads<sup>23</sup> insist on the
spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son<sup>24</sup>
was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature
years.
<div n="P"/>On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible.<sup>25</sup>
It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but
when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a
person of specially high qualifications, as in Viśvāmitra's
adoption of Śunaḥśepa.<sup>26</sup> It is not clear that adoption from
one caste into another was possible, for there is no good
evidence that Viśvāmitra was, as Weber<sup>27</sup> holds, a Kṣatriya
who adopted a Brāhmaṇa. Adoption was also not always in
high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the
Vasiṣṭha book of the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> condemns the usage. It was
also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons,
to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice
appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda<sup>29</sup>
as interpreted by Yāska.<sup>30</sup> Moreover, it is possible that the
difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband<sup>31</sup> may have
been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to
make her a Putrikā, the later technical name for a daughter
whose son is to belong to her father's family.
<div n="P"/>There can be no doubt that in a family the father took
precedence of the mother.<sup>32</sup> Delbrück<sup>33</sup> explains away the
apparent cases to the contrary.<sup>34</sup> There is no trace of the
[Page1-529+ 74]
family as a land-owning corporation.<sup>35</sup> The dual form Pitarau
regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’<sup>36</sup>

of the marriage of the son by the father,

could marry freely, unless his father

<F>35) Baden Powell, whose various
works ({%Indian Village Community,%} 1896;
{%Village Communities in India,%} 1899, etc.)
have done most to combat the view of
the village community in India as a
land-holding institution, is prepared to
recognize the family as a land-owning
unit, considering that the {%patria potestas%}
is a later growth, and not Indian (see,
{%e.g., Village Communities in India,%} 128
{%et seq.%}). Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%}
218 {%et seq.,%} adopts a theory which allows
of individual and joint family owner-
ship side by side, the latter being
apparently the earlier but the decadent
stage. He expressly considers (p. 222)
that the son had an indefeasible right to
prevent the father from alienating the
hereditary land, which could only be
parted with by the consent of the village
if it were a case of joint ownership
({%cf.%} the verse cited by Jolly, {%Recht und%}
{%Sitte,%} 94). But it must be remembered
that, as is very clearly shown in the
case of English law by Pollock and
Maitland ({%History of English Law,%} 2,
337-352), the recognition of the rights
of sons may well be, not a sign of
original joint or family ownership, but
a development from the existence of
intestate succession, and as in England,
so in India, there is no trace of a
corporate joint family in the early
books. And, as Jolly ({%op. cit.,%} 76, 80)
shows, there are clear traces, both in
old and modern times, of a despotic
control of the family by the father even
after his sons grew up, provided only
that he was physically able to control
them. The same state of affairs seems
proved for early English law, as it is
beyond question for Roman law (see
Smith's {%Dictionary of Antiquities,%} 2, 351
{%et seq.%}). In Greece also, which is some-
times contrasted with Rome, there is
the clearest trace of both a real {%patria%}
{%potestas,%} and of the absolute ownership
of the land by the father as against
the son, especially in the archaic laws
of Gortyn (see Gardner and Jevons,
{%Greek Antiquities,%} 404, 405, 563, 566).</F>
