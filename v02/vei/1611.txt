{@Nekṣaṇa@}¦ occurs once in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> where a ‘spit’
seems to be meant. In the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> Nīkṣaṇa occurs, and
must have the same sense; Oldenberg<sup>3</sup> inclines to think that
this word refers to the ‘inspection’ of food, to see if it is
ready (as from {%ni-īkṣ,%} ‘look into’).
