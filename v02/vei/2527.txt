{@Methi@}¦ is found in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> denoting ‘post.’ The
word is also found in the marriage ritual,<sup>2</sup> when the sense is,
according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a post to support
the pole of a chariot. In one passage of the Rigveda it is
perhaps used of posts forming a palisade.<sup>3</sup> In the Pañcaviṃśa
[Page2-178+ 55]
Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> it appears in the form of Methī to denote the post
to which the sacrificial cow is tied. The word is very variously
spelt, Medhi and Meṭhī also being found.
