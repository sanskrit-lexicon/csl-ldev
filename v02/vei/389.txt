{@Urvarā@}¦ is with {@Kṣetra@} the regular expression, from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (<lang n="greek">ἄρουρα</lang>).
Fertile ({%apnasvatī%}) fields<sup>2</sup> are spoken of as well as waste fields
({%ārtanā%}).<sup>3</sup> Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is
clearly referred to both in the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> and in the Atharva-
veda,<sup>5</sup> while allusion is also made to the use of manure.<sup>6</sup> The
fields ({%kṣetra%}) were carefully measured according to the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup>
This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the
plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apālā, in
a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> to her father's field ({%urvarā%}), which
is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal
possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning
fields’ ({%urvarā-sā, urvarā-jit, kṣetra-sā%}),<sup>9</sup> while ‘lord of fields’
used of a god<sup>10</sup> is presumably a transfer of a human epithet
({%urvarā-pati%}). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same
[Page1-100+ 66]
connexion as children,<sup>11</sup> and the conquest of fields ({%kṣetrāṇi%}
{%saṃ-ji%}) is often referred to in the Saṃhitās.<sup>12</sup> Very probably, as
suggested by Pischel,<sup>13</sup> the ploughland was bounded by grass
land (perhaps denoted by {@Khila, Khilya@}) which in all likelihood
would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere.
There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property
in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort,<sup>14</sup> nor is
there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property
in land seems also presumed later on. In the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the things given as examples of wealth include
fields and houses ({%āyatanāni%}). The Greek evidence<sup>16</sup> also
points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the
ownership is of course not determined by the expression
‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head
of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can
only be conjectured (see {@Pitṛ@}). Very often a family may have
lived together with undivided shares in the land. The rules
about the inheritance of landed property do not occur before the
Sūtras.<sup>17</sup> In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> the giving of land as
a fee to priests is mentioned, but with reproof: land was no
doubt even then a very special kind of property, not lightly to
be given away or parted with.<sup>19</sup>

Of course, the rules probably go back
to the earlier period, but how far it is
impossible to say. With the settlement
of the country, however, inheritance of
land and its partition must have become
inevitable.</F>

<F>19) It is significant that in the famous
episode (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 9, 4)
of Manu's division of his property,
from which Nābhānediṣṭha was ex-
cluded, this exclusion is made good by
the son's obtaining cattle ({%paśavaḥ%}). It
is clear that cattle, not land, was the
real foundation of wealth, just as in
Ireland, Italy ({%cf. pecunia%}), Greece, etc.
Cattle could be, and were, used indi-
vidually, but land was not open to a
man's free disposal; no doubt, at any
rate, the consent of the family or the
community might be required, but we
are reduced to reliance on analogy in
view of the silence of the texts. {%Cf.%}
