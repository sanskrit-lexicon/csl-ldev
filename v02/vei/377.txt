{@Upa-sti@}¦ denotes both in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> a
<div n="lb"/>‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic<sup>3</sup> the subordination of the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb
<div n="lb"/>{%upa-sthā,%} ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears,
<div n="lb"/>with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> The exact nature of the dependence connoted by
<div n="lb"/>the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer<sup>5</sup> conjectures that the
<div n="lb"/>‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who
<div n="lb"/>became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and
<div n="lb"/>Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost
<div n="lb"/>their freedom through dicing.<sup>6</sup> The evidence of the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>7</sup> shows that among the Upastis were included the
<div n="lb"/>chariot-makers ({%ratha-kāra%}), the smiths ({%takṣan%}), and the
<div n="lb"/>charioteers ({%sūta%}), and troop-leaders ({%grāma-ṇī%}), while the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ ({%sti%})
<div n="lb"/>being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that
<div n="lb"/>they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but
<div n="lb"/>attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary
<div n="lb"/>population. They may well have included among them not
<div n="lb"/>only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements,
<div n="lb"/>such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men
<div n="lb"/>who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the
<div n="lb"/>Sūta and the Grāmaṇī were, as such, officers of the king's house-
<div n="lb"/>hold — kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda.<sup>8</sup> The use of the word in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā,<sup>9</sup> the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>10</sup> and the Kāṭhaka,<sup>11</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda in which it occurs. In the Paippalāda recension of
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda,<sup>12</sup> Vaiśya, Śūdra, and Ārya are referred to as
<div n="lb"/>Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’
