{@Upa-sti@}¦ denotes both in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> a
‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic<sup>3</sup> the subordination of the
Vaiśya to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb
{%upa-sthā,%} ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears,
with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the
Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> The exact nature of the dependence connoted by
the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer<sup>5</sup> conjectures that the
‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who
became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and
Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost
their freedom through dicing.<sup>6</sup> The evidence of the Athar-
vaveda<sup>7</sup> shows that among the Upastis were included the
chariot-makers ({%ratha-kāra%}), the smiths ({%takṣan%}), and the
charioteers ({%sūta%}), and troop-leaders ({%grāma-ṇī%}), while the
Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ ({%sti%})
being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that
they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but
attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary
population. They may well have included among them not
only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements,
such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men
who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the
Sūta and the Grāmaṇī were, as such, officers of the king's house-
hold — kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described
in the Atharvaveda.<sup>8</sup> The use of the word in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā,<sup>9</sup> the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>10</sup> and the Kāṭhaka,<sup>11</sup> is
purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the
Rigveda in which it occurs. In the Paippalāda recension of
the Atharvaveda,<sup>12</sup> Vaiśya, Śūdra, and Ārya are referred to as
Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’
