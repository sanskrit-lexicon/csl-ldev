{@Takman@}¦ is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject
<div n="lb"/>of five hymns<sup>1</sup> of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned else-
<div n="lb"/>where.<sup>2</sup> Weber<sup>3</sup> first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment.<sup>5</sup> Refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the
<div n="lb"/>patient,<sup>6</sup> to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies
<div n="lb"/>the fever,<sup>7</sup> and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to
<div n="lb"/>describe its varieties are {%anye-dyuḥ,%}<sup>8</sup> {%ubhaya-dyuḥ,%}<sup>9</sup> {%tṛtīyaka,%}<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%vi-tṛtīya,%}<sup>11</sup> and {%sadaṃ-di,%}<sup>12</sup> the exact sense of most of which
<div n="lb"/>terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed<sup>13</sup> that the first
<div n="lb"/>epithet designates the fever known as {%quotidianus,%} which recurs
<div n="lb"/>each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit.
[Page1-295+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>‘on the other — {%i.e.,%} next, day’). The {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} (‘on both
<div n="lb"/>days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two suc-
<div n="lb"/>cessive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the {%rhythmus%}
<div n="lb"/>{%quartanus complicatus.%}<sup>14</sup> But Sāyaṇa considers that it means a
<div n="lb"/>fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The {%tṛtīyaka,%}
<div n="lb"/>however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever,<sup>15</sup> though Zimmer<sup>16</sup> suggests
<div n="lb"/>that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm.
<div n="lb"/>Grohmann<sup>17</sup> regards the {%vi-tṛtīyaka%} as equivalent to the {%tertiana%}
<div n="lb"/>{%duplicata,%} a common form in southern countries, in which the
<div n="lb"/>fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time
<div n="lb"/>or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield<sup>18</sup> suggests
<div n="lb"/>that it is identical with the {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} variety. The {%sadaṃ-di%}<sup>19</sup>
<div n="lb"/>type appears to be the kind later known as {%saṃtata-jvara%}
<div n="lb"/>(‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’
<div n="lb"/>duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack.
<div n="lb"/>Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn ({%śārada%}), in
<div n="lb"/>the hot weather ({%graiṣma%}), in the rains ({%vārṣika%}),<sup>20</sup> but was
<div n="lb"/>especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet
<div n="lb"/>{%viśva-śārada,%} ‘occurring every autumn.’<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>From this Weber<sup>23</sup> deduced that it was considered to be the
<div n="lb"/>result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on
<div n="lb"/>marshy land. Grohmann<sup>24</sup> preferred to see in this connexion
<div n="lb"/>of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters<sup>25</sup>
<div n="lb"/>an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the
<div n="lb"/>time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer.<sup>26</sup> who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence
[Page1-296+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>of fever in the Terai, and interprets {%vanya,%} an epithet of fever
<div n="lb"/>found in the Atharvaveda,<sup>27</sup> as meaning ‘sprung from the
<div n="lb"/>forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among
<div n="lb"/>the {@Mūjavants@} and {@Mahāvṛṣas,@} two mountain tribes of the
<div n="lb"/>western Himālaya.<sup>28</sup> There is no trace of fever having been
<div n="lb"/>observed to be caused by the bite of the {%anopheles%} mosquito,
<div n="lb"/>which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason
<div n="lb"/>been held to be known to classical Indian medicine.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>Among the symptoms of Takman, or among complications
<div n="lb"/>accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ ({@Pāman@}), ‘headache’
<div n="lb"/>({%śīrṣa-śoka%}),<sup>30</sup> ‘cough’ ({@Kāsikā@}), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps
<div n="lb"/>some form of itch ({@Balāsa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is perhaps significant that the Takman does not appear
<div n="lb"/>until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>Āryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease,
<div n="lb"/>which would take some generations to become endemic and
<div n="lb"/>recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it
<div n="lb"/>is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells
<div n="lb"/>and the {@Kuṣṭha,@} which can hardly have been an effective
<div n="lb"/>remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvan period, have claimed many victims, or it would
<div n="lb"/>not be mentioned so prominently.
