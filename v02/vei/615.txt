priests who are opposed to the {@Gaupāyanas,@} Kirāta and {@Akuli@}

according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> No doubt the name is
chosen, not as that of a historic person, but as a suitable
designation of a hostile priest; for it is probably identical with
the name of the mountaineers described in the preceding article.
