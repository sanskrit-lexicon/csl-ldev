{@Nakṣatra-darśa@}¦ (‘gazer at the lunar mansions’), an ‘astro-
loger,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha,
or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda.<sup>1</sup> A notice in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> indicates that that work regarded the
practice of choosing a particular Nakṣatra under which to set
up the sacrificial fires as an idle one, because it decides in
favour of choosing the sun as one's Nakṣatra.
