{@Vi-vadha@}¦ or {@Vī-vadha@} seems to denote a yoke borne on the
shoulders to enable one to carry a weight. But it is found in
the Brāhmaṇas used only metaphorically in such phrases as
{%vi-vivadha,%}<sup>1</sup> ‘with the weight unequally distributed,’ and {%sa-%}
{%vīvadhatā,%}<sup>2</sup> ‘equality of burden.’
