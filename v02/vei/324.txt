{@Iṣīkā,@}¦ ‘a stalk of reed grass,’ occurs frequently from the
Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, often as an emblem of fragility. In
the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka<sup>2</sup> it seems to denote the pin fixed in
the bar of a pen to keep cattle in ({%argaleṣīke,%} ‘bolt and pin’).
A basket ({%śūrpa%}) of Iṣīkā is referred to in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup>
