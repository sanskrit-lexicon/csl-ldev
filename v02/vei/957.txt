{@Camū@}¦ is a term of somewhat doubtful sense occurring
repeatedly in the Rigveda, and connected with the preparation
of Soma. Zimmer<sup>1</sup> considers that in the dual it denotes the
two boards between which, in his opinion, the Soma was
crushed ({%cf.%} {@Adhiṣavaṇa@}). Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, appears to be right
in taking the normal sense to designate a vessel into which the
Soma was poured from the press, and Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> shows
clearly that when it occurs in the plural<sup>4</sup> it always has this
sense, corresponding to the Graha-pātras of the later ritual,
and that sometimes it is so used in the singular<sup>5</sup> or dual<sup>6</sup> also.
In some cases,<sup>7</sup> however, he recognizes its use as denoting the
mortar in which the Soma was pressed: he may be right here,
as this mode of preparation was probably Indo-Iranian.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>In a derivative sense Camū appears in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa<sup>9</sup> to denote a trough, either of solid stone or consisting of
[Page1-256+ 48]
bricks, used by the Eastern people to protect the body of the
dead from contact with the earth, like modern stone-lined
graves or vaults.
