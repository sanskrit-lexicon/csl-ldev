{@Vāma-deva@}¦ is credited<sup>1</sup> by tradition with the authorship of
the fourth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and he is once mentioned
in that Maṇḍala.<sup>2</sup> He is, moreover, credited with the
authorship of the fourth hymn of the Maṇḍala by the Yajur-
veda Saṃhitās.<sup>3</sup> He there appears as a son of {@Gotama,@} while
in one hymn of the fourth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> Gotama
is mentioned as the father of the singer, and in another<sup>5</sup> the
Gotamas occur as praising Indra. In the Bṛhaddevatā<sup>6</sup> two
absurd legends are narrated of Vāmadeva. One describes
Indra as revealing himself in the form of an eagle to the seer
as he cooked the entrails of a dog; the other tells of his
successful conflict with Indra, whom he sold among the
seers. Sieg<sup>7</sup> has endeavoured to trace these tales in the
[Page2-287+ 46]
Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> but without any success. Moreover, though Vāmadeva
is mentioned in the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> and often in the Brāh-
maṇas,<sup>10</sup> he never figures there as a hero of these legends.
