{@Iṣu-dhi@}¦ (‘arrow-holder’) is the name of the quiver which was
carried by every bowman. The word is common from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards. No trace is to be found in Vedic literature
of the later practice of carrying two quivers.<sup>2</sup> According to
Pischel,<sup>3</sup> the curious expression {%iṣu-kṛt%} in the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> means
quiver.
