{@Didhiṣu@}¦ in the Rigveda denotes a ‘wooer.’ It is applied<sup>1</sup>
to the relative, probably brother-in-law,<sup>2</sup> who takes the place
of the husband at the funeral rite, and who, as in the Hebraic
levirate, is to beget a child by the brother's wife if there is
no son.<sup>3</sup> Hillebrandt<sup>4</sup> and Lanman<sup>5</sup> consider that the word
originally meant only ‘wooer,’ and applied to the king who,
after the chief queen had lain beside the dead victim in the
Puruṣamedha or ‘human sacrifice,’ claimed her again; but this
view is hardly plausible.<sup>6</sup> The term is also applied to the god
Pūṣan<sup>7</sup> as the wooer of his mother, apparently Sūryā.<sup>8</sup>
