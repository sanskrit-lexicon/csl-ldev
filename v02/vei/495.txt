{@Kakuha,@}¦ a word occurring several times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>understood by Roth<sup>2</sup> to designate part of a chariot, perhaps the
<div n="lb"/>seat. Ludwig,<sup>3</sup> again, regards it in one passage<sup>4</sup> as the proper
<div n="lb"/>name of a Yādava prince who took spoil from {@Tirindira,@} the
<div n="lb"/>{@Parśu,@} but this view is hardly probable.<sup>5</sup> It is, on the whole,
<div n="lb"/>most likely that the word always means ‘chief,’ ‘pre-eminent,’
<div n="lb"/>being applied as an epithet to horses, chariots, princes, etc.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This is the only sense given by Grassmann,<sup>7</sup> and later adopted
<div n="lb"/>by Roth.<sup>8</sup>
