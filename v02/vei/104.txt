{@Abhi-ṣeka@}¦ (‘besprinkling’). — The Vedic king was conse-
crated after his election with an elaborate ritual, which is fully
described in the Taittirīya,<sup>1</sup> Pañcaviṃśa,<sup>2</sup> Śatapatha,<sup>3</sup> and
Aitareya Brāhmaṇas,<sup>4</sup> and for which the Mantras are given in
the Saṃhitās.<sup>5</sup> The consecration took place by sprinkling with
water ({%abhiṣecanīyā āpaḥ%}).<sup>6</sup> Only kings could be consecrated,
the people not being worthy of it ({%anabhiṣecanīyāḥ%}).<sup>7</sup> The
sprinkler ({%abhiṣektṛ%}) is mentioned in the list of victims at the
Puruṣamedha.<sup>8</sup> The Abhiṣeka is an essential part of the
{@Rājasūya,@} or sacrifice of royal inauguration, being the second
of its component members.
