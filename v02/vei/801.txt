{@Kṣīra,@}¦ ‘milk,’ also called {@Go@} or {@Payas,@} played a large part in
<div n="lb"/>the economy of the Vedic Indians.<sup>1</sup> It was taken warm ({%pakva%}
[Page1-209+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>as it came from the cow,<sup>2</sup> or was used with grain to make a
<div n="lb"/>‘mess cooked with milk’ ({%kṣīra-pākam odanam%}).<sup>3</sup> It was also
<div n="lb"/>used for mixing with Soma ({@Abhiśrī, Āśir@}). From it butter
<div n="lb"/>({@Ghṛta@}) was made. Milk was also curdled, the {@Pūtīkā@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Kvala@} plants, among others, being used for the purpose.<sup>4</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>curdled milk ({@Dadhi@}) was undoubtedly used for food; and a
<div n="lb"/>kind of cheese is perhaps referred to in one passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> Goat's milk ({%aja-kṣīra%}) is also mentioned.<sup>6</sup>
