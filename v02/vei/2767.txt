{@Lauhitya,@}¦ ‘descendant of Lohita,’ is the patronymic of a
large number of teachers in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa,
which clearly must have been the special object of study of the
Lauhitya family. See {@Kṛṣṇadatta, Kṛṣṇarāta, Jayaka, Tri-@}
{@veda Kṛṣṇarāta, Dakṣa Jayanta, Palligupta, Mitrabhūti,@}
{@Yaśasvin Jayanta, Vipaścit Dṛḍhajayanta, Vaipaścita@}
{@Dārḍhajayanti, Vaipaścita Dārḍhajayanti Dṛḍhajayanta, Śyā-@}
{@majayanta, Śyāmasujayanta, Satyaśravas.@} A Lauhitya or
Lauhikya is also mentioned as a teacher in the Śāṅkhāyana
Āraṇyaka.<sup>1</sup> The form of name (Jayanta) affected by the family,
and the silence of the older texts, proves that they were
modern.
