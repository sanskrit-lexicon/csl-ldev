{@Ulūka@}¦ is the ordinary word for ‘owl’ from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
onwards. The bird was noted for its cry,<sup>2</sup> and was deemed
the harbinger of ill-fortune ({%nairṛta%}).<sup>3</sup> Owls were offered at the
horse sacrifice to the forest trees,<sup>4</sup> no doubt because they
roosted there.
