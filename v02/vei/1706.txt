{@Pari-srut@}¦ is the name of a drink which is mentioned first in
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and which was distinct from both {@Surā@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Soma,@}<sup>2</sup> but was intoxicating. According to Mahīdhara,<sup>3</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>liquor was made from flowers ({@Puṣpa@}). Zimmer<sup>4</sup> thinks that
<div n="lb"/>it was the family drink, and this is supported by the fact that
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda it twice occurs as a household beverage.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> is of opinion that it was very much the same as
<div n="lb"/>Surā.
