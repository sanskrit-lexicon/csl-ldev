{@Gardabha,@}¦ ‘the ass,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as inferior
to the horse. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā he again appears as
inferior to the horse,<sup>2</sup> but at the same time as the best bearer
of burdens ({%bhāra-bhāritama%}) among animals.<sup>3</sup> The same
authority styles the ass {%dvi-retas,%} ‘having double seed,’<sup>4</sup> in
allusion to his breeding with the mare as well as the she-ass.
The smallness of the young of the ass, and his capacity for
eating, are both referred to.<sup>5</sup> The disagreeable cry of the
animal is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,<sup>6</sup> and in allusion to
this the term ‘ass’ is applied opprobriously to a singer in the
Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> A hundred asses are spoken of as a gift to a singer
in a Vālakhilya hymn.<sup>8</sup> The mule ({%aśvatara%}) is the offspring of
an ass and a mare, the latter, like the ass, being called {%dvi-%}
{%retas,%}<sup>9</sup> ‘receiving double seed,’ for similar reasons. The male
ass is often also termed {@Rāsabha.@} The female ass, Gardabhī,
is mentioned in the Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup> and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad.<sup>11</sup>
