<L>1679<pc>1-492<k1>परावृज्<k2>परावृज्
{@Parā-vṛj@}¦ is a term found in four passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in all of which it refers to a person in a forlorn condition,
<div n="lb"/>while one<sup>2</sup> of them also speaks of him as going south. Sāyaṇa's<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>view that the word is a proper name is most unlikely, while
<div n="lb"/>Grassmann's<sup>4</sup> explanation of it as ‘cripple’ is still less probable.
[Page1-493+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>Roth's<sup>5</sup> interpretation of it as ‘exile’ seems clearly right in the
<div n="lb"/>passage which refers to the Parāvṛj as going south. Zimmer<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>accepts Roth's view for this passage, but in the others sees
<div n="lb"/>a reference to the child of a maiden exposed by her and in
<div n="lb"/>danger of being eaten by insects ({%vamrī%}). This view is sup-
<div n="lb"/>ported by the fact that {%parāvṛkta%} seems to have the same
<div n="lb"/>sense,<sup>7</sup> and is accepted by Oldenberg.<sup>8</sup>
