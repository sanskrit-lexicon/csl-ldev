{@Ud-īcyas.@}¦ — The Brāhmaṇas of the northern parts are referred
to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> as engaging, with {@Svaidāyana@}
{@Śaunaka@} as their spokesman, in a dispute with the Kurupañcāla
Brāhmaṇa {@Uddālaka Āruṇi,@} and as vanquishing him. Their
relation to the Kurupañcālas appears also from the fact that in
[Page1-087+ 47]
the same Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> reference is made to the speech of the
north being similar to that of the Kurupañcālas. The speech
of the Northerners was also celebrated for purity; hence
Brāhmaṇas used to go to the north for purposes of study,
according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> while in the Buddhist
texts the school of Takṣaśilā (in Gandhāra) is famous as a
resort of students.<sup>4</sup> Possibly, too, Sanskrit was specially
developed in Kaśmīr, as suggested by Franke.<sup>5</sup> See also {@Kuru.@}
