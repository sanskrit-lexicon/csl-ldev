{@Ud-īcyas.@}¦ — The Brāhmaṇas of the northern parts are referred
<div n="lb"/>to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> as engaging, with {@Svaidāyana@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Śaunaka@} as their spokesman, in a dispute with the Kurupañcāla
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa {@Uddālaka Āruṇi,@} and as vanquishing him. Their
<div n="lb"/>relation to the Kurupañcālas appears also from the fact that in
[Page1-087+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>the same Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> reference is made to the speech of the
<div n="lb"/>north being similar to that of the Kurupañcālas. The speech
<div n="lb"/>of the Northerners was also celebrated for purity; hence
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas used to go to the north for purposes of study,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> while in the Buddhist
<div n="lb"/>texts the school of Takṣaśilā (in Gandhāra) is famous as a
<div n="lb"/>resort of students.<sup>4</sup> Possibly, too, Sanskrit was specially
<div n="lb"/>developed in Kaśmīr, as suggested by Franke.<sup>5</sup> See also {@Kuru.@}
