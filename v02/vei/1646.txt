{@Pañca-nada,@}¦ ‘having five streams,’ is not found until the
epic period as the name of the Panjāb, which has no desig-
nation in the earlier literature. The importance of the Panjāb
as the home<sup>1</sup> of the Rigveda has been greatly diminished by
recent research, Hopkins,<sup>2</sup> Pischel,<sup>3</sup> and Geldner<sup>4</sup> having on
different grounds shown reason for believing that the Rigveda,
at least in great part, was composed farther east, in the
{@Madhyadeśa,@} which admittedly was the home of the later Vedic
culture. Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> considers that the Rigveda belongs in
part to the Panjāb, or rather to Arachosia, and in part to the
Middle Country. See also {@Kuru, Tṛtsu.@}
