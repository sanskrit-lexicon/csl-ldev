{@Pañca-nada,@}¦ ‘having five streams,’ is not found until the
<div n="lb"/>epic period as the name of the Panjāb, which has no desig-
<div n="lb"/>nation in the earlier literature. The importance of the Panjāb
<div n="lb"/>as the home<sup>1</sup> of the Rigveda has been greatly diminished by
<div n="lb"/>recent research, Hopkins,<sup>2</sup> Pischel,<sup>3</sup> and Geldner<sup>4</sup> having on
<div n="lb"/>different grounds shown reason for believing that the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>at least in great part, was composed farther east, in the
<div n="lb"/>{@Madhyadeśa,@} which admittedly was the home of the later Vedic
<div n="lb"/>culture. Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> considers that the Rigveda belongs in
<div n="lb"/>part to the Panjāb, or rather to Arachosia, and in part to the
<div n="lb"/>Middle Country. See also {@Kuru, Tṛtsu.@}
