{@Kraya,@}¦ ‘sale,’ is a word which does not actually occur in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, though the verb {%krī,%} from which this noun is derived,
<div n="lb"/>is found there.<sup>1</sup> Both noun and verb are common in the later
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> Sale appears to have regularly consisted in barter
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda:<sup>3</sup> ten cows are regarded as a possible price for
<div n="lb"/>an (image of) Indra to be used as a fetish, while elsewhere not
<div n="lb"/>a hundred, nor a thousand, nor a myriad are considered as an
<div n="lb"/>adequate price ({%śulka%}) for the purchase of Indra.<sup>4</sup> The Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>5</sup> mentions, as possible objects of commerce, garments
<div n="lb"/>({%dūrśa%}), coverlets ({%pavasta%}), and goatskins ({%ajina%}). The haggling
<div n="lb"/>of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> is directed to
<div n="lb"/>procuring success in trade. The ‘price’ was called {@Vasna,@} and
<div n="lb"/>the ‘merchant’ {@Vaṇij.@} his greed being well known.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little evidence of a standard of value in currency
<div n="lb"/>having been adopted. When no specific mention is made of
<div n="lb"/>the standard, the unit was probably the cow.<sup>9</sup> In a consider-
<div n="lb"/>able number of passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>elsewhere,<sup>11</sup> however, the expression {%hiraṇyaṃ śata-mānam%}
<div n="lb"/>suggests that there must have been some standard other than
[Page1-197+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>cows, though it might in all these passages be rendered as
<div n="lb"/>‘gold worth a hundred cows.’ But the use of the {@Kṛṣṇala@} as a
<div n="lb"/>measure of weight<sup>12</sup> suggests that the meaning is ‘gold weighing
<div n="lb"/>a hundred Kṛṣṇalas,’ and this seems the more probable explana-
<div n="lb"/>tion. This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where
<div n="lb"/>the meaning of the term {@Manā,@} which occurs once, is mysterious,
<div n="lb"/>and where necklets ({@Niṣka@}) seem to have been one of the more
<div n="lb"/>portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and
<div n="lb"/>may perhaps have served as a means of exchange.
