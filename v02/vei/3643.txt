{@Sūta@}¦ is the name of a court official who is often mentioned
with the {@Grāmaṇī.@} He is one of the eight {@Vīras@} in the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> and of the eleven {@Ratnins@} in other texts.<sup>2</sup>
He also appears in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> among the kingmakers
({@Rājakṛt@}) and in the Śatrarudriya<sup>4</sup> (‘section dealing with the
hundred Rudras’) of the Yajurveda. The commentators are
agreed in seeing in him the ‘charioteer’ ({@Sārathi@}) or ‘master of
the horse,’ of the king; this sense is accepted by Roth,<sup>5</sup> by
Whitney,<sup>6</sup> and by Bloomfield.<sup>7</sup> But the fact that the {@Saṃ-@}
[Page2-463+ 49]
{@grahītṛ,@} who occurs in several passages beside the Sūta, is the
‘charioteer,’ renders this version improbable. Eggeling<sup>8</sup> thinks
that he was, in the Brāhmaṇas at least, a minstrel and court
poet, while Weber<sup>9</sup> considers that his name denotes him as
‘consecrated’ — that is, one who has constant access to the
king. In the Epic the Sūta serves as a royal herald and
bard:<sup>10</sup> it may be that the curious words {%ahanti,%}<sup>11</sup> {%ahantya,%}<sup>12</sup> or
{%ahantva%}<sup>13</sup> applied to him<sup>14</sup> in the Śatarudriya denote his sacred
character at once as minstrel and as herald — a combination of
functions not unknown elsewhere.
