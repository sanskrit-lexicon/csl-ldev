{@Kṣetriya@}¦ is a disease which is mentioned several times in the
Atharvaveda, and against which three hymns are specially
directed.<sup>1</sup> It is also mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> and
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> The commentators on the Athar-
vaveda agree in taking it to be a hereditary disease. The word
may mean ‘organic,’<sup>4</sup> or possibly ‘produced in the field,’ as a
theory of its origin. What disease is really intended is quite
uncertain. Weber<sup>5</sup> considered that the aim of the Atharvan
hymns was to drive away injury threatening the fields, but this
is improbable. Bloomfield<sup>6</sup> suggests ‘scrofula’ or ‘syphilis.’
The remedies mentioned throw no light on the symptoms.
