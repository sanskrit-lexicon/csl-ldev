{@Nau@}¦ is the regular word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for a
‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was
merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat
was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab
as well as the {@Yamunā@} and {@Gaṅgā.@} Often no doubt the Nau
was a mere dug-out canoe ({%dāru%}).<sup>3</sup> It is certainly against the
theory<sup>4</sup> of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea
trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such
as masts and sails, except the oar ({@Aritra@}), Yet there are some
allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied
by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> compares
the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the
[Page1-462+ 49]
sinking of a ship which is leaking ({%bhinnā%}); though the language
here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was
only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover,
there is mention made in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> of men who go to the
ocean ({@Samudra@}) eager for gain ({%saniṣyavaḥ%}). It is not altogether
satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer<sup>7</sup> to the
broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with
the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> too it is said
that the Aśvins rescued {@Bhujyu@} in the ocean with a ship of
a hundred oars ({%śatāritra%}). It is not easy to refuse to recognize
here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for
sea voyages. The Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,<sup>9</sup> at any rate,
clearly refers to maritime navigation. See also {@Samudra.@}
