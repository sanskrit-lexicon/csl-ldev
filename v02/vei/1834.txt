{@Piśāca@}¦ is the name of a class of demon mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> they are
<div n="lb"/>associated with Rakṣases and Asuras, while opposed to gods,
<div n="lb"/>men, and fathers. In the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> they are described as
<div n="lb"/>{%kravyād,%} ‘eaters of raw flesh,’ which may be the etymological
<div n="lb"/>sense of the word Piśāca itself.<sup>5</sup> It is possible that the Piśācas
<div n="lb"/>were, as suggested by Grierson,<sup>6</sup> really human foes, like the
<div n="lb"/>north-western tribes, who even in later times were reputed
<div n="lb"/>eaters of raw flesh (not necessarily as cannibals, but rather as
<div n="lb"/>eaters of human flesh in ritual). This is, however, not at all
<div n="lb"/>likely, the Piśācas having in all probability only meant ‘ghouls’
<div n="lb"/>originally: when they appear as human tribes, they were
<div n="lb"/>presumably thus designated in scorn. A science called Piśāca-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>7</sup> or Piśāca-vidyā<sup>8</sup> is known in the later Vedic period.
