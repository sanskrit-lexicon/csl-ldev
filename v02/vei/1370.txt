{@Devavant@}¦ is mentioned in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the ancestor of {@Sudās,@} apparently his grand-
<div n="lb"/>father; or if {@Pijavana@} be accepted as Sudās' father, and
<div n="lb"/>{@Divodāsa@} as his grandfather, then his great-great-grandfather,
<div n="lb"/>and father of {@Vadhryaśva.@} The succession in the latter case
<div n="lb"/>would then be Devavant, Vadhryaśva, Divodāsa, Pijavana,
<div n="lb"/>Sudās.
