{@Devavant@}¦ is mentioned in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in
the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the ancestor of {@Sudās,@} apparently his grand-
father; or if {@Pijavana@} be accepted as Sudās' father, and
{@Divodāsa@} as his grandfather, then his great-great-grandfather,
and father of {@Vadhryaśva.@} The succession in the latter case
would then be Devavant, Vadhryaśva, Divodāsa, Pijavana,
Sudās.
