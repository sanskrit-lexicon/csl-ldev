{@Pañca-janāḥ,@}¦ the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various
names in Vedic literature.<sup>1</sup> Who are meant by the five is very
uncertain. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> explains the five to be
gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers.
[Page1-467+ 60]
Aupamanyava<sup>3</sup> held that the four castes ({@Varṇa@}) and the
{@Niṣādas@} made up the five, and Sāyaṇa<sup>4</sup> is of the same opinion.
Yāska<sup>5</sup> thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods,
Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be
regarded as probable. Roth<sup>6</sup> and Geldner<sup>7</sup> think that all the
peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters
({@Diś@}), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with
the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer<sup>8</sup> opposes this view on
the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is
not in harmony with the distinction so often made between
Āryan and Dāsa; that neither {%janāsaḥ,%} ‘men,’<sup>9</sup> nor {%mānuṣāḥ,%}
‘people,’<sup>10</sup> could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is
referred to as being among the five tribes;<sup>11</sup> that the five tribes
are mentioned as on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>12</sup> and that Indra is {%pāñca-%}
{%janya,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that
Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the
{@Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas,@} and {@Pūrus,@} who are all
mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the
Rigveda,<sup>14</sup> and four of whom occur in another hymn.<sup>15</sup> But he
admits that the expression might easily be used more generally
later. Hopkins<sup>16</sup> has combated Zimmer's view, but his own
opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people
named Turvaśa, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvaśa,
and that theory is not very probable.

<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup>
the five peoples are opposed to the Bharatas, and in the former
work<sup>19</sup> seven peoples are alluded to.
