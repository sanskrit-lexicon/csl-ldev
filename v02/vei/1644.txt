{@Pañca-janāḥ,@}¦ the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various
<div n="lb"/>names in Vedic literature.<sup>1</sup> Who are meant by the five is very
<div n="lb"/>uncertain. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> explains the five to be
<div n="lb"/>gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers.
[Page1-467+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>Aupamanyava<sup>3</sup> held that the four castes ({@Varṇa@}) and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Niṣādas@} made up the five, and Sāyaṇa<sup>4</sup> is of the same opinion.
<div n="lb"/>Yāska<sup>5</sup> thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods,
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as probable. Roth<sup>6</sup> and Geldner<sup>7</sup> think that all the
<div n="lb"/>peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters
<div n="lb"/>({@Diś@}), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with
<div n="lb"/>the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer<sup>8</sup> opposes this view on
<div n="lb"/>the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is
<div n="lb"/>not in harmony with the distinction so often made between
<div n="lb"/>Āryan and Dāsa; that neither {%janāsaḥ,%} ‘men,’<sup>9</sup> nor {%mānuṣāḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘people,’<sup>10</sup> could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is
<div n="lb"/>referred to as being among the five tribes;<sup>11</sup> that the five tribes
<div n="lb"/>are mentioned as on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>12</sup> and that Indra is {%pāñca-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%janya,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that
<div n="lb"/>Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas,@} and {@Pūrus,@} who are all
<div n="lb"/>mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>14</sup> and four of whom occur in another hymn.<sup>15</sup> But he
<div n="lb"/>admits that the expression might easily be used more generally
<div n="lb"/>later. Hopkins<sup>16</sup> has combated Zimmer's view, but his own
<div n="lb"/>opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people
<div n="lb"/>named Turvaśa, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvaśa,
<div n="lb"/>and that theory is not very probable.

<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the five peoples are opposed to the Bharatas, and in the former
<div n="lb"/>work<sup>19</sup> seven peoples are alluded to.
