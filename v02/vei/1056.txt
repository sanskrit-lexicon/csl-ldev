{@Jāyā@}¦ regularly denotes ‘wife,’ and, as opposed to {@Patnī,@} wife
as an object of marital affection, the source of the continuance
[Page1-286+ 57]
of the race.<sup>1</sup> So it is used of the wife of the gambler, and of
the wife of the Brāhmaṇa in the Rigveda;<sup>2</sup> it is also frequently
combined with {@Pati,@} ‘husband,’<sup>3</sup> both there and in the later
literature.<sup>4</sup> Patnī, on the other hand, is used to denote the
wife as partner in the sacrifice;<sup>5</sup> when no share in it is assigned
to her, she is called Jāyā.<sup>6</sup> The distinction is, of course,
merely relative; hence one text<sup>7</sup> calls Manu's wife Jāyā,
another<sup>8</sup> Patnī. Later on Jāyā is superseded by Dāra.
