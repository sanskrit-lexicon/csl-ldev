{@Kṣetra,@}¦ ‘field.’ The use of this word in the Rigveda points
clearly to the existence of separate fields<sup>1</sup> carefully measured
off,<sup>2</sup> though in some passages the meaning is less definite,
[Page1-211+ 64]
indicating cultivated land generally.<sup>3</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> and
later the sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the
more general use is also found.<sup>5</sup> The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,<sup>6</sup>
‘Lord of the Field,’ should probably be understood as the god
presiding over each field, just as Vāstoṣ Pati presides over each
dwelling.<sup>7</sup> It is a fair conclusion from the evidence that the
system of separate holdings already existed in early Vedic
times.^8 See also {@Urvarā, Khilya.@}
