{@Nābhā-nediṣṭha@}¦ (‘nearest in descent’) {@Mānava@} (‘descendant
<div n="lb"/>of Manu’) is famous in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>for the way in which he was treated when his father {@Manu@}
<div n="lb"/>divided his property among his sons, or they divided it:
<div n="lb"/>Nābhānediṣṭha was left out, but was solaced by obtaining,
<div n="lb"/>through his father's advice, cows from the Aṅgirases, a feat
<div n="lb"/>which is regarded in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> as on a
<div n="lb"/>level with the exploits of other seers who celebrated their
<div n="lb"/>patrons in hymns, and as giving rise to the hymn, Rigveda x. 62.
<div n="lb"/>Nābhānediṣṭha's hymn is repeatedly mentioned in the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas,<sup>3</sup> but beyond its authorship nothing is recorded of him.
<div n="lb"/>In the Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> itself he seems to be spoken of as a poet in
<div n="lb"/>one passage, which is, however, of quite uncertain meaning.
<div n="P"/>Nābhānediṣṭha is etymologically connected in all probability
<div n="lb"/>with Nabānazdiṣta in the Avesta, which refers to the Fravaṣi
<div n="lb"/>of the paoiryō-ṭkaēsha and the Fravaṣi of the Nabānazdiṣta.
<div n="lb"/>Lassen<sup>5</sup> saw in the legend a reminiscence of an Indo-Iranian
<div n="lb"/>split; but Roth<sup>6</sup> showed conclusively that this was impossible,
<div n="lb"/>and that Nābhānediṣṭha meant simply ‘nearest in birth,’ and
[Page1-443+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>Weber<sup>7</sup> admits that the connexion of the words is not one of
<div n="lb"/>borrowing on either side, but that in the Avesta it has kept its
<div n="lb"/>original sense of ‘nearest relation,’ while in the Rigveda it has
<div n="lb"/>become a proper name.
