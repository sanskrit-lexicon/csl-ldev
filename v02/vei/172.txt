{@Aśva-tara, Aśva-tarī@}¦ are respectively the masculine and
feminine name of ‘mule.’ These animals are mentioned
frequently from the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> onwards. They were known
not to be fruitful,<sup>2</sup> and were probably considered inferior to
horses,<sup>3</sup> but a mule-car was quite common.<sup>4</sup>
