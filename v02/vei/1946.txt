{@Paijavana,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Pijavana,@}’ is the patronymic of
{@Sudās.@}<sup>1</sup> It seems most probable that Pijavana intervened in
the line of succession between {@Divodāsa@} and Sudās, because
the two kings have, according to tradition, quite different
Purohitas, the former being served by the {@Bharadvājas@} as his
priests, the latter by {@Vasiṣṭha@} and {@Viśvāmitra;@}<sup>2</sup> this is more
natural if they were divided by a period of time than if they had
been, as is usually supposed, father and son. Geldner,<sup>3</sup> how-
ever, identifies Divodāsa and Pijavana.
