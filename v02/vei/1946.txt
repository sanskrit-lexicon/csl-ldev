{@Paijavana,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Pijavana,@}’ is the patronymic of
<div n="lb"/>{@Sudās.@}<sup>1</sup> It seems most probable that Pijavana intervened in
<div n="lb"/>the line of succession between {@Divodāsa@} and Sudās, because
<div n="lb"/>the two kings have, according to tradition, quite different
<div n="lb"/>Purohitas, the former being served by the {@Bharadvājas@} as his
<div n="lb"/>priests, the latter by {@Vasiṣṭha@} and {@Viśvāmitra;@}<sup>2</sup> this is more
<div n="lb"/>natural if they were divided by a period of time than if they had
<div n="lb"/>been, as is usually supposed, father and son. Geldner,<sup>3</sup> how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, identifies Divodāsa and Pijavana.
