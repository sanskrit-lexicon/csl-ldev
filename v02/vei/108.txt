{@A-bhrātaraḥ@}¦ (‘brotherless’). — The lot of girls without brothers
<div n="lb"/>is referred to in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as unsatisfactory — apparently
<div n="lb"/>they became prostitutes. The Nirukta<sup>2</sup> expressly forbids
<div n="lb"/>marriage with a brotherless maiden, probably because of the
<div n="lb"/>risk of her being made a {%putrikā%} (‘adoptive daughter’) by her
<div n="lb"/>father — that is, any son of hers being counted as belonging to
<div n="lb"/>her father's, instead of to her husband's, family. See {@Ayogū.@}
