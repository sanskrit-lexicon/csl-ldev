{@Viś@}¦ is an expression of somewhat doubtful significance. In
many passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the sense of ‘settlement’ or
‘dwelling’ is adequate and probable, since the root {%viś%} means
to ‘enter’ or ‘settle.’ In other passages, where the Viśaḥ
[Page2-306+ 64]
stand in relation to a prince, the term must mean ‘subject’;<sup>2</sup>
so, for example, when the people of {@Tṛṇaskanda@}<sup>3</sup> or of the
{@Tṛtsus@} are mentioned.<sup>4</sup> Again, in some passages<sup>5</sup> the general
sense of ‘people’ is adequate; as when the Rigveda speaks of
the ‘Āryan people,’<sup>6</sup> or the ‘divine people,’<sup>7</sup> or the ‘Dāsa
people,’ and so on.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sometimes,<sup>9</sup> however, the Viś appear in a more special sense
as a subdivision of the {@Jana@} or whole people. This is, how-
ever, not common, for in most passages one or other of the
senses given above is quite possible. Moreover, it is very
difficult to decide whether the Viś as a subdivision of the Jana
is to be considered as being a local subdivision (canton) or a
blood kinship equivalent to a clan in the large sense of the
word, while the relation of the Viś to the {@Grāma@} or to the
{@Gotra@} is quite uncertain. In one passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup>
the Viśaḥ are mentioned along with the {%sabandhavaḥ%} or relatives,
but no definite conclusion can be drawn from that fact. Nor
does the analogy of the Roman {%curia%} or the Greek <lang n="greek">φρήτρη</lang> throw
much light, as these institutions are themselves of obscure
character, and the parallelism need not be cogent. It is, at
any rate, possible that the Viś may in some cases have been no
more than a Gotra or clan, or different clans may sometimes
[Page2-307+ 72]
have made up a Viś, while Grāma is more definitely, perhaps, a
local designation. But the Vedic evidence is quite inconclusive.<sup>11</sup>
{%Cf.%} {@Viśpati.@}
<div n="P"/>In the later period the sense of Viś is definitely restricted in
some cases<sup>12</sup> to denote the third of the classes of the Vedic
polity, the people or clansmen as opposed to the nobles ({@Kṣatra,@}
{@Kṣatriya@}) and the priests ({@Brahman, Brāhmaṇa@}). For the
position of this class, see {@Vaiśva.@}

Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 159, reckons
here Rv. i. 172, 3; vii. 33, 6; ix. 7, 5;
x. 124, 8; 173, 1; but these cases and
many others are rather instances of
‘subjects’ than of a division of the
tribe such as ‘canton.’</F>
<F>10) xv. 8, 2, 3, {%Cf.%} xiv. 2, 27, and
Rv. x. 91, 2, in n. 9.</F>
<F>11) The Viś may have been originally
a clan settled in one place: there is
no passage where ‘Gotra’ would not
probably make sense; Rv. ii. 26, 3,
cannot be pressed unduly to distinguish
{%ianman%} and Viś. Compare the phrase
used of the Maruts {%śardhaṃ śardham,%}
{%vrātaṃ vrātam, gaṇaṃ gaṇam,%} in Rv.
v. 53. 11, where no precise sense can
fairly be attributed to the words, though
Zimmer sees in them a threefold division
of the host corresponding to Jana, Viś,
and Grāma. The rendering ‘Gau’ has
therefore little foundation.</F>
<F>12) Perhaps to this sense belong the
numerous passages in the Brāhmaṇas
and later Saṃhitās referring to strife
between the Viś and the Kṣatra, the
clansmen and the chiefs, or the
peasantry and the nobles — {%e.g.,%} Tait-
tirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 11, 2; Maitrāyaṇī
