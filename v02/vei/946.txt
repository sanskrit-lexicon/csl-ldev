{@Ghoṣā@}¦ is mentioned as a protégée of the Aśvins in two
passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> probably as the recipient of a husband,
who is perhaps referred to in another passage<sup>2</sup> as Arjuna,
though this is not likely. Sāyaṇa finds a reference there to
a skin disease, which is considered in the later tradition of the
Bṛhaddevatā<sup>3</sup> to have been the cause of her remaining unwed,
but this view is not tenable. According to Sāyaṇa, her son,
Suhastya, is alluded to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda;<sup>4</sup>
Oldenberg,<sup>5</sup> however, here sees a reference to Ghoṣā herself,
while Pischel<sup>6</sup> thinks that the form ({%ghoṣe%}) is not a noun at all,
but verbal.

by the fact that Vadhrimatī was given
