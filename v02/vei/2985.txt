{@Viśva-karman Bhauvana@}¦ (‘descendant of Bhuvana’) is the
<div n="lb"/>name of a quite mythical king. He is said in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa to have been consecrated by {@Kaśyapa,@} to whom he
<div n="lb"/>offered the earth ({%i.e.,%} presumably a piece of land) as a sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>fee; in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he performed the Sarvamedha
<div n="lb"/>(‘universal sacrifice’), and made a similar offer; in both cases
<div n="lb"/>the earth refused to be given. The story seems to contain a
<div n="lb"/>reference to the early dislike of gifts of land,<sup>3</sup> but it cannot be
<div n="lb"/>stated with certainty that this is the meaning.
