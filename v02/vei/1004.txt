{@Jana,@}¦ besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a
tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’
or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’
({@Panca Janāḥ@} or {@Janāsaḥ@}) are frequently referred to, and in
one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the ‘people of Yadu’ ({%yādva jana%})
and the {@Yadus@} ({%yādvāḥ%}) are synonymous. Again, the king
({%rājan%}) is described as ‘protector ({%gopā%}) of the people ({%janasya%}),’<sup>2</sup>
and there are other references to king and Jana.<sup>3</sup> The people
of the {@Bharatas@} ({%bhārata jana%}) is also mentioned;<sup>4</sup> there is no
ground to assume with Hopkins<sup>5</sup> that Jana in this case means
a clan or horde ({@Grāma@}), as distinguished from a people.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided.
Zimmer<sup>6</sup> argues from a passage in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> that a people
was divided into cantons ({@Viś@}), cantons into joint families or
clans, or village communities ({@Grāma, Vṛjana@}), and these again
into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are
reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, Viś, Janman, and
Putrāḥ, or sons, and argues that each village community was
originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful
whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The
division of the Jana into several Viś may be regarded as
probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage
of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> which mentions the Viś as a unit of the fighting
men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient
Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military
arrangement. But the subdivision of the Viś into several
Grāmas is very doubtful. Zimmer<sup>9</sup> admits that neither Grāma<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-270+ 47]
nor {@Vṛjana@}<sup>11</sup> has the special sense of a subdivision of the Viś
when used for war, for both words only denote generally an
armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in
{@Vrā@}<sup>12</sup> and in {@Vrāja,@}<sup>13</sup> but it is sufficient to say that the former
passage is of extremely doubtful import,<sup>14</sup> and that the latter
has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state
in what exact relation the Grāma in Vedic times stood to the
Viś or to the family (Kula or Gotra). The confusion is increased
by the vagueness of the sense of both Grāma and Viś. If the
latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the Grāma
must have been a part of a district; but if a Viś was a unit of
relationship, then a Grāma may have contained families of
different Viśes, or may have sometimes coincided with a
Viś, or have contained only a part of a Viś. But in any
case the original state of affairs must have been greatly
modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitu-
tion of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The
elements of the people were represented by the family — either
as an individual family inhabiting one home ({@Kula@}), and con-
sisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a
patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father — and
by the clan, the later {@Gotra,@} which included all those who
claimed a common ancestor. The Gotra may be regarded as
roughly corresponding to the Latin {%gens%} and the Greek <lang n="greek">γένος</lang>,
and possibly the Viś may be the equivalent of the {%curia%} and
<lang n="greek">φρήτρη</lang>, and the Jana of the {%tribus%} and <lang n="greek">φῦλον</lang> or <lang n="greek">φῦλη</lang>.<sup>15</sup> These
three divisions may also be seen in the Viś, Zantu, and Daqyu
of the Iranian world, where the use of Viś suggests that in the
Indian Viś a relationship based on blood rather than locality is
meant — and perhaps even in the {%vicus, pagus,%} and {%civitas%} of the
old German polity described in the Germania<sup>16</sup> of Tacitus.
The family in some form appears as the third element of the
Jana in a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>17</sup> where the house ({%gṛha%}) is
[Page1-271+ 44]
contrasted with the Jana and the Viś. Possibly, too, another
passage<sup>18</sup> contrasts the {%adhvara,%} or family sacrifice, with that of
the Jana or Viś, rather than, as Zimmer<sup>19</sup> thinks, the village
with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particu-
larism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a
fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe,
there is no sure trace<sup>20</sup> of any intermediate cult between that of
the king and that of the individual householder. The real
elements in the state are the Gotra and the Jana, just as
ultimately the {%gens%} and {%tribus,%} the <lang n="greek">γένος</lang> and <lang n="greek">φῦλον</lang> are alone
important. It may be that Viś sometimes represents in the
older texts what later was known as the Gotra. See {@Viś.@}
<div n="P"/>This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the
Brāhmaṇa period is considered. The tribe or people still exists,
and is presupposed, but the division into Viś disappears. The
real division is now the separate castes ({@Varṇa@}), but the
numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to
be based in part on the ancient Gotra.
