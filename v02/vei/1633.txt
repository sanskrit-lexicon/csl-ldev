{@Paktha@}¦ is the name of a people in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where they
appear as one of the tribes that opposed<sup>2</sup> the {@Tṛtsu-Bharatas@} in
the {@Dāśarājña.@} or ‘battle of the ten kings.’ Zimmer<sup>3</sup> compares
[Page1-464+ 44]
them with the tribe of <lang n="greek">Πάκτυες</lang> and their country <lang n="greek">Πακτυική</lang>,
mentioned as in the north-west of India by Herodotus,<sup>4</sup> and
with the modern Pakhthūn in Eastern Afghanistan, holding
that they were a northern tribe; this is probable, since the
Bharatas seem to have occupied the Madhyadeśa, or ‘Middle
Land.’ In three passages of the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> a Paktha is referred
to as a protégé of the Aśvins. The second connects him with
{@Trasadasyu,@} whose tribe, the {@Pūrus,@} were aided by the Pakthas
in their unsuccessful onslaught on {@Sudās.@} In the third passage
he seems specified as {@Tūrvāyaṇa,@} and appears as an opponent
of {@Cyavāna.@}<sup>6</sup> Probably, therefore, Paktha in all cases denotes
the king of the Paktha people.
