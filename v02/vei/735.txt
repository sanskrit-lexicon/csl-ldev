{@Kosala@}¦ is the name of a people not occurring in the earliest
Vedic literature. In the story of the spread of Āryan culture
told in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> the Kosala-Videhas, as the
offspring of {@Videgha Māthava,@} appear as falling later than the
Kuru-Pañcālas under the influence of Brahminism. The same
passage gives the {@Sadānīrā@} as the boundary of the two peoples
 — Kosala and Videha. Elsewhere<sup>2</sup> the Kausalya, or Kosala
king, {@Para Āṭṇāra Hairaṇyanābha,@} is described as having
performed the great Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice. Connexion
with {@Kāśi@} and {@Videha@} appears also from a passage of the
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.<sup>3</sup> Weber<sup>4</sup> points out that Āśvalāyana,
who was very probably a descendant of {@Aśvala,@} the Hotṛ priest
of Videha, is called a Kosala in the Praśna Upaniṣad.<sup>5</sup> The
later distinction of North and South Kosala is unknown to
both Vedic and Buddhist literature.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kosala lay to the north-east of the Ganges, and corresponded
roughly to the modern Oudh.
