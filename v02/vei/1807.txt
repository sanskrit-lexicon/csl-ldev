{@Pāśa-dyumna Vāyata@}¦ is the name of a king to whom the
{@Vasiṣṭhas@} claim to have been preferred by Indra in one hymn
of the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> Apparently he was, as Sāyaṇa says, son of
Vayat, who may be compared with the {@Vyat of another@} passage
of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> Ludwig<sup>3</sup> sees in him a priest of the {@Pṛthus@}
and {@Parśus,@} but this is most improbable.<sup>4</sup>
