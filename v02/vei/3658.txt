{@Sṛñjaya@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned as early as the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda. Sṛñjaya (that is, the king of this people) {@Daivavāta@}
<div n="lb"/>is celebrated as victorious over the {@Turvaśas@} and the {@Vṛcī-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@vants,@}<sup>1</sup> and his sacrificial fire is referred to.<sup>2</sup> In connexion
<div n="lb"/>with Daivavāta is also mentioned {@Sāhadevya Somaka,@}<sup>3</sup> no
<div n="lb"/>doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> we find
<div n="lb"/>Somaka Sāhadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally {@Suplan@})
<div n="lb"/>Sārñjaya, as kings who were anointed by {@Parvata@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Nārada.@} The Rigveda<sup>5</sup> has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’)
<div n="lb"/>of {@Prastoka,@}<sup>6</sup> a Sṛñjaya, who is lauded along with {@Divodāsa.@}
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, {@Vītahavya@}<sup>7</sup> seems to have been a Sṛñjaya, though
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>8</sup> prefers to take the derivative word, {@Vaitahavya,@} not
<div n="lb"/>as a patronymic, but as an epithet.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the {@Tṛtsus@} were
<div n="lb"/>closely allied, for Divodāsa and a Sṛñjaya prince are celebrated
<div n="lb"/>together,<sup>9</sup> and the Turvaśas were enemies of both.<sup>10</sup> This view
<div n="lb"/>is borne out by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> which recognizes
<div n="lb"/>{@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} as Purohita of the {@Kurus@} and the
<div n="lb"/>Sṛñjayas.
[Page2-470+ 49]
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas,
<div n="lb"/>at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to have offended the {@Bhṛgus@} and to have ended miserably.
<div n="lb"/>There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but
<div n="lb"/>both the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>13</sup> and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>14</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained
<div n="lb"/>some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled
<div n="lb"/>with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate
<div n="lb"/>of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their dis-
<div n="lb"/>obedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this
<div n="lb"/>allusion.
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt<sup>15</sup> suggests that in early times they must be looked
<div n="lb"/>for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though
<div n="lb"/>he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that
<div n="lb"/>the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the <lang n="greek">Σαράγγαι</lang><sup>16</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer<sup>17</sup> is inclined
<div n="lb"/>to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide
<div n="lb"/>definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well
<div n="lb"/>have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their
<div n="lb"/>allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the {@Madhyadeśa,@} and were certainly
<div n="lb"/>absorbed in the Kurus.
<div n="P"/>Of the history of this clan we have one notice.<sup>18</sup> They
<div n="lb"/>expelled {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana,@} one of their kings, from the
<div n="lb"/>hereditary monarchy — of ten generations — and also drove out
<div n="lb"/>{@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati,@} probably his minister,
<div n="lb"/>who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the
<div n="lb"/>king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, {@Balhika@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Prātīpya.@} Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at
<div n="lb"/>the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the
<div n="lb"/>king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can
[Page2-471+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view,<sup>19</sup> as a
<div n="lb"/>defeat of the Sṛñjayas.
