{@Yajñopavīta@}¦ denotes the ‘wearing of the Brahminical thread
over the left shoulder at the sacrifice,’ and is mentioned as early
as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup> Tilak,<sup>2</sup> however, urges that it
was not originally a thread that was worn, but a garment of
cloth ({@Vāsas@}) or of deerskin ({@Ajina@}). This seems quite probable.
<F>1) iii. 10, 9, 12. {%Cf.%} Taittirīya Saṃ-
hitā, ii. 5, 11, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa,
ii. 4, 2, 1; 6, 1, 12; and {@Prācīnāvīta.@}</F>
<F>2) {%Orion,%} 145 {%et seq.,%} quoting Tait-
tirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, and, the view of
the Mīmāmsists, Jaiminīyanyāyamālā-
vistara, iii. 4, 1. This view is not
prejudiced by the quite implausible
conjectures as to Orion's belt with
which it is combined. {%Cf.%} Eggeling,
