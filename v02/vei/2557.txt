{@Yajñopavīta@}¦ denotes the ‘wearing of the Brahminical thread
<div n="lb"/>over the left shoulder at the sacrifice,’ and is mentioned as early
<div n="lb"/>as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup> Tilak,<sup>2</sup> however, urges that it
<div n="lb"/>was not originally a thread that was worn, but a garment of
<div n="lb"/>cloth ({@Vāsas@}) or of deerskin ({@Ajina@}). This seems quite probable.

<div n="lb"/>hitā, ii. 5, 11, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa,

<F>2) {%Orion,%} 145 {%et seq.,%} quoting Tait-

<div n="lb"/>the Mīmāmsists, Jaiminīyanyāyamālā-
<div n="lb"/>vistara, iii. 4, 1. This view is not
<div n="lb"/>prejudiced by the quite implausible
<div n="lb"/>conjectures as to Orion's belt with
<div n="lb"/>which it is combined. {%Cf.%} Eggeling,
