{@Salva@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned in a passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> which records a boast by {@Śyāparṇa@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Sāyakāyana@} that if a certain rite of his had been completed,
<div n="lb"/>his race would have been the nobles, Brahmins, and peasants
<div n="lb"/>of the Salvas, and even as it was his race would surpass
<div n="lb"/>the Salvas. This people appears also to be alluded to as
<div n="lb"/>{%Sālvīḥ (prajāḥ)%} in the Mantra Pāṭha,<sup>2</sup> where they are said to
<div n="lb"/>have declared that their king was {@Yaugandhari@} when they
<div n="lb"/>stayed their chariots<sup>3</sup> on the banks of the {@Yamunā.@} There is
<div n="lb"/>later evidence<sup>4</sup> indicating that the Sālvas or Śālvas were
<div n="lb"/>closely connected with the {@Kuru-Pañcālas,@} and that apparently
<div n="lb"/>some of them, at least, were victorious near the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Yamunā. There is no good evidence to place them in the
<div n="lb"/>north-west in Vedic times.<sup>5</sup>

<F>3) Winternitz, {%Mantra-pāṭha,%} xlv-xlvii,
<div n="lb"/>sees in the verse an allusion to the
<div n="lb"/>Sālva women turning round the wheel
<div n="lb"/>(? spinning-wheel). But a reference
<div n="lb"/>to a warlike raid seems more plau-
<div n="lb"/>aible.</F>

<div n="lb"/>Kāśikā Vṛtti on Pāṇini, iv. 1, 173.</F>
