2. {@Akṣa.@}¦ — This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main
<div n="lb"/>amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent
<div n="lb"/>mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable
<div n="lb"/>difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it
<div n="lb"/>was played.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%The Material.%} — The dice appear normally to have been
<div n="lb"/>made of Vibhīdaka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> hence being called ‘brown’
<div n="lb"/>({%babhru%}), and ‘born on a windy spot.’<sup>3</sup> In the ritual game of
<div n="lb"/>dice at the Agnyādheya and the Rājasūya ceremonies the
<div n="lb"/>material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that
<div n="lb"/>occasionally gold imitations of Vibhīdaka nuts were used.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use
<div n="lb"/>of cowries as dice.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>(2) {%The Number.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> the dicer is described as
<div n="lb"/>‘leader of a great horde’ ({%senānīr mahato gaṇasya%}), and in
<div n="lb"/>another passage<sup>7</sup> the number is given as {%tri-pañcāśaḥ,%} an expres-
<div n="lb"/>sion which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> Weber,<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Zimmer<sup>10</sup> render it as fifteen, which is grammatically
<div n="lb"/>hardly possible. Roth<sup>11</sup> and Grassmann<sup>12</sup> render it as ‘con-
<div n="lb"/>sisting of fifty-three.’ Lüders<sup>13</sup> takes it as ‘consisting of one
<div n="lb"/>hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a
<div n="lb"/>vague expression for a large number. For a small number
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>14</sup> cites a reference in the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> to one who fears
<div n="lb"/>‘him who holds four’ ({%caturaś cid dadamānāt%}), but the sense of
<div n="lb"/>that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of
<div n="lb"/>playing the game.
<div n="P"/>(3) {%The Method of Play.%} — In several passages of the later
[Page1-003+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas lists are given of expressions con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with dicing. The names are Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara,
<div n="lb"/>Āskanda, and Abhibhū in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.<sup>16</sup> In the
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> among the victims at the Puruṣamedha,
<div n="lb"/>the {%kitava%} is offered to the Akṣarāja, the {%ādinava-darśa%} to the
<div n="lb"/>Kṛta, the {%kalpin%} to the Tretā, the {%adhi-kalpin%} to the Dvāpara,
<div n="lb"/>the {%sabhā-sthāṇu%} to the Āskanda. The lists in the parallel
<div n="lb"/>version of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa are {%kitava, sabhāvin, ādinava-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%darśa, bahiḥ-sad,%} and {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%}<sup>18</sup> and Aksarāja, Kṛta, Tretā,
<div n="lb"/>Dvāpara, and Kali. From the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>19</sup> it appears
<div n="lb"/>that another name of Kali was Abhibhū, and the parallel lists
<div n="lb"/>in the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās suggest that Abhibhū
<div n="lb"/>and Akṣarāja are identical, though both appear in the late
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa list. The names of some of these throws
<div n="lb"/>go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs
<div n="lb"/>in the latter,<sup>20</sup> and Lüders<sup>21</sup> shows that in a considerable number
<div n="lb"/>of passages in the former Kṛta means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or ‘what is won’<sup>23</sup> and this sense is clearly found in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup> Moreover, that there were more throws ({%ayāḥ%})
<div n="lb"/>than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> when
<div n="lb"/>the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying
<div n="lb"/>wealth.
<div n="P"/>The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg
<div n="lb"/>Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied
<div n="lb"/>either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so
<div n="lb"/>marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late
<div n="lb"/>commentators.<sup>26</sup> But there is no evidence for the former
<div n="lb"/>interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīdaka nuts,<sup>27</sup> used as dice, forbids any side being properly
<div n="lb"/>on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip-
[Page1-004+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>tion of a ritual game<sup>28</sup> at the Agnyādheya and at the Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>ceremonies. The details are not certain,<sup>29</sup> but it is clear that
<div n="lb"/>the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a
<div n="lb"/>number divisible by four, the Kṛta, the other three throws then
<div n="lb"/>being the Tretā, when three remained over after division by
<div n="lb"/>four; the Dvāpara, when two was the remainder; and the Kali,
<div n="lb"/>when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the
<div n="lb"/>throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the Kṛta was that
<div n="lb"/>when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals
<div n="lb"/>marked on them, the only question being what was the total
<div n="lb"/>number of the dice themselves.
<div n="P"/>There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details
<div n="lb"/>must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly
<div n="lb"/>large,<sup>30</sup> and the reference to throwing fours,<sup>31</sup> and losing by one,
<div n="lb"/>points to the use of the Kṛta as the winning throw. The
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda,<sup>32</sup> on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as
<div n="lb"/>the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must
<div n="lb"/>have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players
<div n="lb"/>merely pick out the number of dice required — no doubt to avoid
<div n="lb"/>ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had
<div n="lb"/>been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown,<sup>33</sup>
<div n="lb"/>perhaps on the principle suggested by Lüders:<sup>34</sup> the one
<div n="lb"/>throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other
<div n="lb"/>then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown
<div n="lb"/>a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for
<div n="lb"/>the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player,
<div n="lb"/>as in the Nala.
<div n="P"/>No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which
[Page1-005+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>the dice were thrown ({%adhi-devana, devana,%}<sup>35</sup> {%iriṇa%}<sup>36</sup> ), was made
<div n="lb"/>in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to
<div n="lb"/>a case for keeping dice in ({%akṣa-vapana%}<sup>37</sup> The throw was called
<div n="lb"/>{%graha%}<sup>38</sup> or earlier {%grābha.%}<sup>39</sup> The stake is called {%vij.%}<sup>40</sup> Serious
<div n="lb"/>losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments
<div n="lb"/>the loss of all his property, including his wife.<sup>41</sup> Lüders<sup>42</sup> finds
<div n="lb"/>a different form of the game referred to in the Chāndogya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad.<sup>43</sup>
