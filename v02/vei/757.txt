{@Kauśāmbeya@}¦ is the patronymic (‘descendant of Kuśāmba’)
of a teacher {@Proti@} in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> according to
the St. Petersburg Dictionary: a view supported by the fact
that {@Kūśāmba@} actually occurs as the name of a man in the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> It is, however, possible that the
word means a ‘native of the town Kauśāmbī’ as understood
by Harisvāmin in his commentary on the Śatapatha Brāhmana.<sup>3</sup>
