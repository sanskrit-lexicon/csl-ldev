{@Saṃ-vatsara,@}¦ ‘year,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the
Rigveda onwards.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>It duration was, according to the concurrent evidence of
the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, 360 days, divided into 12 months,
being, no doubt, roughly a lunar synodic year, which, however,
it exceeded in length by 6 days.<sup>2</sup> As a solar year it appears
only in the Nidāna Sūtra<sup>3</sup> of the Sāmaveda, where the sun is
stated to spend 13(1/3) days in each of the 27 Nakṣatras.
[Page2-412+ 53]
<div n="P"/>The year being obviously out of harmony with the solar year
(whether sidereal or tropical), efforts were certainly made to
effect an assimilation of the natural and the accepted year. As
has been seen (see {@Māsa@}), the evidence goes strongly to show
that the intercalation was not an easy matter in the Brāh-
maṇa period, though there are traces of what may be re-
garded as a five-yearly or six-yearly intercalation. But there
is no conclusive evidence that these periods were really
observed.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer,<sup>4</sup> indeed, considers that the evidence required is
afforded by the lists of the years, which are sometimes
enumerated as five: Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara,
Idvatsara, and Vatsara;<sup>5</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat-
sara, Iduvatsara, Vatsara;<sup>6</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Idāvatsara, Iduvat-
sara, Idvatsara, Vatsara;<sup>7</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat-
sara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara;<sup>8</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara,
Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Idvatsara.<sup>9</sup> But it must be noted not
merely that the names vary considerably, but that four only are
mentioned in some places,<sup>10</sup> in others<sup>11</sup> three, in others<sup>12</sup> two,
and in yet others<sup>13</sup> six. Moreover, in none of these enumera-
tions is there any reference to the names being connected with
a system of intercalation. It is most probable that here we
have no more that a mere series of priestly variations of
Vatsara, based on the older and more genuine Saṃvatsara and
Parivatsara as variants of the simple Vatsara, ‘year.’ The key
to the invention of the series is probably to be found in
passages like that of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>14</sup> where the
several {@Cāturmāsya@} (‘four-monthly’) sacrifices are equated
[Page2-413+ 54]
with the different years.<sup>15</sup> Particularly unjustifiable is the
attempt of Zimmer to see in the two-year series a series of two
years of 354 days each, with an intercalary month in the
second; for the year of 354 days, as such, is not known to have
existed before the Sūtra period.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>16</sup> also finds an attempt at intercalation in the
famous 12 days in which the Ṛbhus are said to have slept in
the house of Agohya.<sup>17</sup> He thinks that they represent twelve
days added at the winter solstice to equate the lunar year of
354 days and the solar year of 366 days; and from the rever-
ence paid in German antiquity to the ‘12 nights,’ he infers
that this mode of intercalation is Indo-Germanic.<sup>18</sup> There can
be little doubt that this view is wrong, and that the 12 days are
merely the ‘reflexion of the year’ ({%saṃvatsarasya pratimā%})<sup>19</sup> in
the sense that they represent the twelve months, and have no
relation to chronology at all.
<div n="P"/>A reference to the use of Saṃvatsara alone as the fifth year
of the cycle is seen by Shamasastry<sup>20</sup> in the peculiar dating of
certain notices in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>21</sup> but this view
is improbable.<sup>22</sup>
