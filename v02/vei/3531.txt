{@Sāṃjīvī-putra,@}¦ ‘son of Sāṃjīvī,’ is the name of a teacher
who appears in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the
tenth Kāṇḍa of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> and at the end of
the fourteenth Kāṇḍa in the Kāṇva recension,<sup>2</sup> as a pupil of
{@Māṇḍūkāyani.@} In the Vaṃśas at the end of the Bṛhadāraṇ-
yaka Upaniṣad in both recensions<sup>3</sup> he is given as a pupil of
{@Prāśnīputra Āsurivāsin.@} It seems clear that he united in
himself two lines of teachers — that of the tradition of the fire-
cult from {@Śāṇḍilya,@} and that of the tradition of {@Yājñavalkya.@}
