{@Hotṛ@}¦ is the name of one of the oldest and most important
<div n="lb"/>priests of the Vedic ritual, the counterpart of the Zaotar of the
<div n="lb"/>Avestan priesthood.<sup>1</sup> The word must be derived from {%hu,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘sacrifice,’ as was held by {@Aurṇavābha;@}<sup>2</sup> this indicates a time
<div n="lb"/>when the Hotṛ was at once sacrificer (the later Adhvaryu) and
<div n="lb"/>singer. But the functions were already clearly divided in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, where the Hotṛ's chief duty was the recitation of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Śastras.@} He was also in the older period often the {@Purohita@}
<div n="lb"/>of the king, an office later filled by the {@Brahman@} priest.
