{@Hotṛ@}¦ is the name of one of the oldest and most important
priests of the Vedic ritual, the counterpart of the Zaotar of the
Avestan priesthood.<sup>1</sup> The word must be derived from {%hu,%}
‘sacrifice,’ as was held by {@Aurṇavābha;@}<sup>2</sup> this indicates a time
when the Hotṛ was at once sacrificer (the later Adhvaryu) and
singer. But the functions were already clearly divided in the
Rigveda, where the Hotṛ's chief duty was the recitation of the
{@Śastras.@} He was also in the older period often the {@Purohita@}
of the king, an office later filled by the {@Brahman@} priest.
