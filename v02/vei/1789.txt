{@Pārikṣita,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Parikṣit,@}’ is the patronymic of
{@Janamejaya@} in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> The Pārikṣitīya appear in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>4</sup> as performers of the
horse sacrifice. In a Gāthā there cited they are called Pāri-
kṣitas. Apparently they were the brothers of Janamejaya, named
{@Ugrasena, Bhīmasena,@} and {@Śrutasena.@} In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad<sup>5</sup> the question whither they have gone is made the
subject of a philosophical discussion. It is clear that the family
had passed away before the time of the Upaniṣad, and it is also
clear that there had been some serious scandal mingled with
their greatness which they had, in the opinion of the Brahmins,
atoned for by their horse sacrifice with its boundless gifts to
the priests. Weber<sup>6</sup> sees in this the germ of the Epic stories
which are recorded in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="P"/>The verses relating to Parikṣit in the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> are called
Pārikṣityaḥ in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>8</sup>
