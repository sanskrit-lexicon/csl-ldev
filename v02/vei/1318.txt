{@Dīrgha-tamas@}¦ (‘long darkness’) {@Māmateya@} (‘son of Mamatā’)
{@Aucathya@} (‘son of Ucatha’) is mentioned as a singer in one
hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and is referred to in several passages<sup>2</sup>
by his metronymic, Māmateya, alone. He is said, both in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,<sup>3</sup> to have attained
the tenth decade of life. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> he
appears as the priest of {@Bharata.@} The Bṛhaddevatā<sup>5</sup> contains
a preposterous legend made up of fragments of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup>
according to which Dīrghatamas was born blind, but recovered
his sight; in old age he was thrown into a river by his servants,
one of whom, {@Traitana,@} attacked him, but killed himself
instead. Carried down by the stream, he was cast up in the
Aṅga country, where he married Uśij, a slave girl, and begot
{@Kakṣīvant.@} The two legends here combined are not even con-
sistent, for the second ignores Dīrghatamas' recovery of sight.
To attach any historical importance to them, as does Pargiter,<sup>7</sup>
would seem to be unwise.
