{@Go-dāna@}¦ appears to mean ‘the whiskers’ in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where the person, being consecrated, first shaves
off the right and then the left ‘whisker.’ Later on the Godāna-
vidhi, or ceremony of shaving the head, is a regular part of the
initiation of a youth on the attainment of manhood and on
marriage;<sup>2</sup> but though the ceremony is recognized in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup> the name<sup>4</sup> does not occur there.
<F>1) iii. 1, 2, 5, 6.</F>
<F>2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 19;
Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 28, etc.</F>
<F>3) vi. 68. See Kauśika Sūtra, liii. 17-
20. But Av. ii. 13 is not to be classed
here as in the Kauśika; it refers to the
giving of a new garment to a child,
and the removal of its first wrap. See
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva-
veda, 56, 57, correcting Weber, {%Indische%}
{%Studien,%} 13, 173, and Zimmer, {%Altin-%}

{%Hymns of the Atharvaveda,%} 306, 574, 665.</F>
<F>4) The meaning ‘whisker’ is a secon-
dary one, derived, doubtless, from the
‘gift of a cow’ ({%go-dāna%}), accompanying
the ceremony of shaving the whiskers
or hair.</F>
