{@Oṣadhi.@}¦ — Roughly speaking, the vegetable world is divided
in Vedic literature<sup>1</sup> between Oṣadhi or {@Vīrudh@} ‘plants’ and
{@Vana@} or {@Vṛkṣa@} ‘trees.’ Oṣadhi is employed in opposition to
Vīrudh to denote plants as possessing a healing power or some
other quality useful to men, while Vīrudh is rather a generic
term for minor vegetable growths, but sometimes,<sup>2</sup> when occur-
ring beside Oṣadhi, signifies those plants which do not possess
medicinal properties.
<div n="P"/>A list of the minor parts of which a plant is made up is given
in the later Saṃhitās.<sup>3</sup> It comprises the root ({%mūla%}), the
panicle ({%tūla%}), the stem ({%kāṇḍa%}), the twig ({%valśa%}), the flower
({%puṣpa%}), and the fruit ({%phala%}), while trees<sup>4</sup> have, in addition, a
corona ({%skandha%}), branches ({%śākhā%}), and leaves ({%parṇa%}). The
Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> gives an elaborate, though not very intelligible,
division of plants into those which expand ({%pra-stṛṇatīḥ%}), are
bushy ({%stambinīḥ%}), have only one sheath ({%eka-śuṅgāḥ%}), are
creepers ({%pra-tanvatīḥ%}), have many stalks ({%aṃśumatīḥ%}), are
[Page1-126+ 35]
jointed ({%kāṇḍinīḥ%}), or have spreading branches ({%vi-śākhāḥ%}). In
the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> plants are termed ‘fruitful’ ({%phalinīḥ%}), ‘blossom-
ing’ ({%puṣpavatīḥ%}), and ‘having flowers’ ({%pra-sūvarīḥ%}).

{%vanaspati%} is a frequent compound, from
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (vi. 1, 1, 12)
onwards. The medicinal properties of
plants account for the epithet ‘of
manifold powers’ ({%nānā-vīryā%}) applied
to them in Av. xii. 1, 2.</F>
