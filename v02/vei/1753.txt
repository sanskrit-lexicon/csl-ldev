2. {@Pastyā-vant@}¦ occurs in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> in the
locative parallel with {@Suṣoma, Śaryaṇāvant,@} and {@Ārjīka.@} It
must apparently denote a place, as Pischel<sup>2</sup> argues, probably
corresponding to the locality ‘in the middle of the streams’
({%madhye pastyānām%}), elsewhere<sup>3</sup> referred to as the home of Soma.
Pischel<sup>4</sup> suggests that Patiāla is meant, though he does not lay
any stress on the similarity of name. In the north of Patiāla
there are hills where the Soma might have grown. Roth<sup>5</sup>
thought that something connected with the Soma press was
meant.

Max Müller, {%Sacred Books of the East,%}
32, 260, 398, 399, takes Pastyāvant
as a place-name, but thinks that {%pastyā%}
denotes ‘hamlet,’ or, as an epithet of
Aditi, refers to her as a ‘housewife’
(Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5).</F>
