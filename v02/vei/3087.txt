{@Vaira@}¦<sup>1</sup> and {@Vaira-deya@}<sup>2</sup> seem to have in the later Saṃhitās
and the Brāhmaṇas the definite and technical sense of ‘wergeld,’
the money to be paid for killing a man as a compensation to
his relatives. This view is borne out by the Sūtras of Āpa-
stamba<sup>3</sup> and Baudhāyana.<sup>4</sup> Both prescribe the scale of
1,000 cows for a {@Kṣatriya,@}<sup>5</sup> 100 for a {@Vaiśya,@} 10 for a {@Śūdra,@}
and a bull over and above in each case. Āpastamba leaves the
destination of the payment vague, but Baudhāyana assigns it
to the king. It is reasonable to suppose that the cows were
intended for the relations, and the bull was a present to the
king for his intervention to induce the injured relatives to
abandon the demand for the life of the offender. The Āpa-
stamba Sūtra<sup>6</sup> allows the same scale of wergeld for women, but
the Gautama Sūtra<sup>7</sup> puts them on a level with men of the
Śūdra caste only, except in one special case. The payment is
made for the purpose of {%vaira-yātana%} or {%vaira-niryātana,%} ‘requital
of enmity,’ ‘expiation.’
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda<sup>8</sup> preserves, also, the important notice that a
man's wergeld was a hundred (cows), for it contains the epithet
{%śata-dāya,%} ‘one whose wergeld is a hundred.’ No doubt the
values varied, but in the case of {@Śunaḥśepa@} the amount is a
hundred (cows) in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup> In the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās<sup>10</sup> {%śata-dāya%} again appears.
[Page2-332+ 37]
<div n="P"/>The fixing of the price shows that already public opinion, and
perhaps the royal authority, was in Rigvedic times diminishing
the sphere of private revenge; on the other hand, the existence
of the system shows how weak was the criminal authority of
the king ({%cf.%} {@Dharma@}).
