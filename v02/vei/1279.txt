{@Dasyu,@}¦ a word of somewhat doubtful origin, is in many
<div n="lb"/>passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> clearly applied to superhuman
<div n="lb"/>enemies. On the other hand, there are several passages in
<div n="lb"/>which human foes, probably the aborigines, are thus designated.
<div n="lb"/>This may be regarded as certain in those passages where the
<div n="lb"/>Dasyu is opposed to the Āryan, who defeats him with the aid
<div n="lb"/>of the gods.<sup>2</sup> The great difference between the Dasyus and
<div n="lb"/>the Āryans was their religion: the former are styled ‘not
<div n="lb"/>sacrificing,’ ‘devoid of rites,’ ‘addicted to strange vows,’ ‘god-
<div n="lb"/>hating,’ and so forth.<sup>3</sup> As compared with the {@Dāsa,@} they are
<div n="lb"/>less distinctively a people: no clans ({%viśaḥ%}) of the Dasyus are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned, and while Indra's {%dasyu-hatya,%} ‘slaughter of the
<div n="lb"/>Dasyus,’ is often spoken of, there is no corresponding use of
<div n="lb"/>{%dāsa-hatya.%} That the Dasyus were real people is, however,
<div n="lb"/>shown by the epithet {%anās%} applied to them in one passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> The sense of this word is not absolutely certain: the
<div n="lb"/>Pada text and Sāyaṇa both take it to mean ‘without face’ ({%an-ās%}),<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>but the other rendering, ‘noseles’ ({%a-nās%}), is quite possible,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>4 Rv. i. 51, 5, 6; 103, 4; x. 95, 7;
<div n="lb"/>99, 7; 105, 11. {%Cf. dasyu-han.%} ‘Dasyu-
<div n="lb"/>slaying,’ i. 100, 12; vi. 45, 24; viii. 76,
<div n="lb"/>11; 77, 3; x. 47, 4 (all of Indra);
<div n="lb"/>vi. 16, 15; viii. 39, 8 (of Agni), etc.
[Page1-348+ 68]
<div n="lb"/>and would accord well with the flat-nosed aborigines of the
<div n="lb"/>Dravidian<sup>8</sup> type, whose language still persists among the Brahuis,
<div n="lb"/>who are found in the north-west. This interpretation would
<div n="lb"/>receive some support from Vṛtra's being called ‘broken-nosed’
<div n="lb"/>if this were a correct explanation of the obscure word {%rujānās.%}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The other epithet of the Dasyus is {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} which
<div n="lb"/>occurs with {%anās,%}<sup>10</sup> and which has been rendered<sup>11</sup> ‘of stam-
<div n="lb"/>mering, or unintelligible speech.’ This version is by no
<div n="lb"/>means certain, and since the epithet is elsewhere<sup>12</sup> applied
<div n="lb"/>to Āryans, its correct meaning is more probably ‘of hostile
<div n="lb"/>speech.’
<div n="P"/>Dasyu corresponds with the Iranian {%daṅhu, daqyu,%} which
<div n="lb"/>denotes a ‘province.’ Zimmer<sup>13</sup> thinks that the original
<div n="lb"/>meaning was ‘enemy,’ whence the Iranians developed the
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘hostile country,’ ‘conquered country,’ ‘province,’
<div n="lb"/>while the Indians, retaining the signification of ‘enemy,’ ex-
<div n="lb"/>tended it to include demon foes. Roth<sup>14</sup> considers that the
<div n="lb"/>meaning of human enemy is a transfer from the strife of gods
[Page1-349+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>and demons. Lassen<sup>15</sup> attempted to connect the contrast
<div n="lb"/>{%daqyu: dasyu%} with that of {%daeva: deva,%} and to see in it a result
<div n="lb"/>of the religious differences which, according to Haug's theory,
<div n="lb"/>had separated the Iranians and the Indians. The word may
<div n="lb"/>have originally meant ‘ravaged land’<sup>16</sup> as a result of invasion;
<div n="lb"/>hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human
<div n="lb"/>foes were more usually called by the cognate name of {@Dāsa.@}
<div n="P"/>Individual Dasyus are {@Cumuri, Śambara, Śuṣṇa,@} etc.
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the word has, as later,<sup>18</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>sense of uncivilized peoples generally.

<F>6) This sense allows of two inter-
<div n="lb"/>pretations: ‘misfeatured,’ which seems
<div n="lb"/>that of Roth, St. Petersburg Dic-
<div n="lb"/>tionary, {%s.v.,%} and Grassmann, {%Wörter-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%buch;%} or ‘speechless’ (that is, unable
<div n="lb"/>to speak the language of the Āryans),
<div n="lb"/>which is that of Bollensen, {%Zeitschrift%}

<F>8) The suggestion in the {%Indian Empire,%}
<div n="lb"/>1, 390, that the modern Brahui type is
<div n="lb"/>the true Dravidian, while the modern
<div n="lb"/>Dravidian is the result of fusion with
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍā-speaking tribes, would render
<div n="lb"/>this theory improbable. But it seems
<div n="lb"/>more probable that the Brahuis in
<div n="lb"/>speech preserve the tradition of Dra-
<div n="lb"/>vidian settlements in North India.</F>

<div n="lb"/>berg, {%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} 1, 31, 32 (who

<F>12) The expression is used of the
<div n="lb"/>Āryan Pūrus in vii. 18, 13; of the Paṇis
<div n="lb"/>in vii. 6, 3; and of hostile persons in
<div n="lb"/>i. 174, 2; v. 32, 8; x. 23, 5. Roth,
<div n="lb"/>{%Erläuterungen zum Nirukta,%} 97, thinks
<div n="lb"/>the sense is ‘of insulting speech,’ and
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer, {%op. cit.,%} 114, 115, strongly
<div n="lb"/>supports this view. But Hillebrandt,
<div n="lb"/>{%op. cit.,%} 1, 89, 90, 114, prefers to see in
<div n="lb"/>it ‘speaking an enemy's speech,’ and
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the Pūrus were dialectically
<div n="lb"/>different from the Bharatas — a view
<div n="lb"/>which can be supported from the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23, 24,
<div n="lb"/>where the Asuras say {%he'lavo%} (= {%he'rayo,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘ho, enemies,’ in Sanskrit). See Muir,

<div n="lb"/>Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%} 26,
<div n="lb"/>31, n. 3. The word could thus apply
<div n="lb"/>to the Dasyus also, as the strange
<div n="lb"/>speech of the enemy could be either
<div n="lb"/>Āryan or aboriginal.</F>

<div n="lb"/>to be derived from the root {%das,%} which,
