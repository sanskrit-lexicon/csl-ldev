{@Vṛddha-dyumna Ābhipratāriṇa@}¦ (‘descendant of Abhipra-
tārin’) is the name of a prince ({%rājanya%}) in the Aitareya Brāh-
maṇa (iii. 48, 9), where his priest, {@Śucivṛkṣa Gaupalāyana,@} is
praised. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xv, 16, 10-13), on
the contrary, he is said to have erred in the {@sacrifice,@} when a
Brahmin prophesied that the result would be the expulsion of
the {@Kurus@} from {@Kurukṣetra, an event which@} actually came
to pass.
