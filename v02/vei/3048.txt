{@Vetasu@}¦ is a name occurring in the singular in two passages
of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and once in the plural.<sup>2</sup> It seems that he was
defeated by Indra, but there is no reason to assume that he
was a demon. Zimmer<sup>3</sup> thinks that the Vetasus were probably
the tribe of which {@Daśadyu@} was a member, and that they
defeated the {@Tugras.@} The passages are too obscure to render
any version probable.
