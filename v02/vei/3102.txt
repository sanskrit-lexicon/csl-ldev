{@Vy-aśva@}¦ is the name of a Ṛṣi, a protégé of the Aśvins,<sup>1</sup>
mentioned in several hymns of the eighth Maṇḍala,<sup>2</sup> which
may have been the composition of a descendant of his, {@Viśva-@}
{@manas.@} In two other passages<sup>3</sup> he is referred to only as a Ṛṣi
of the past, and Oldenberg<sup>4</sup> points out that none of his own
work appears in the Saṃhitā. The Rigveda also mentions<sup>5</sup>
the Vyaśvas, with whom Ludwig<sup>6</sup> is inclined to connect {@Vaśa@}
{@Aśvya.@} An {@Āṅgirasa@} Vyaśva occurs as a seer of Sāmans or
Chants in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup>
