{@Sū-kara@}¦ ‘wild-boar,’ has the appearance of being an onomato-
poetic word (‘making the sound {%sū%}’); it is more probably a
very old word going back to the Indo-European period, and
cognate with the Latin {%su-culus%} (‘little pig’), being transformed
in sense by popular etymology.<sup>1</sup> It occurs in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
and later.<sup>3</sup> It appears once in the Atharvaveda accompanied
by {%mṛga,%}<sup>4</sup> the combined words apparently meaning ‘wild hog,’
as opposed to {@Varāha,@} ‘boar.’

does not indicate that {%sūkara%} is a new
name, because the latter word elsewhere
always occurs alone both in the Rigveda
