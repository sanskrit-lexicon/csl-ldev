{@Yakṣu@}¦ is mentioned, once in the singular and once in the
plural, in the hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> which celebrates {@Sudās@}
battle with the ten kings. Who they were and what part they
played in that conflict is quite uncertain. They seem, from the
wording of the text, to have taken part in two conflicts, as
Zimmer<sup>2</sup> says — one on the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi), and one on the
{@Yamunā@} (Jumna) — with the aid of the {@Ajas@} and {@Śigrus,@} under
the leadership of {@Bḥeda.@} It is, however, at least possible that
in the former passage {@Yadu@} should be read for Yakṣu, or, at
any rate, Yakṣu be deemed a contemptuous substitute of the
name of a possibly un-Āryan or unimportant tribe (as their
allies, the Ajas and Śigrus, clearly were) for the name of the
certainly famous Yadus, as is suggested by Hopkins.<sup>3</sup> {%Cf.%}

the Yadus are alluded to, but it seems
