{@Yakṣu@}¦ is mentioned, once in the singular and once in the
<div n="lb"/>plural, in the hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> which celebrates {@Sudās@}
<div n="lb"/>battle with the ten kings. Who they were and what part they
<div n="lb"/>played in that conflict is quite uncertain. They seem, from the
<div n="lb"/>wording of the text, to have taken part in two conflicts, as
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>2</sup> says — one on the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi), and one on the
<div n="lb"/>{@Yamunā@} (Jumna) — with the aid of the {@Ajas@} and {@Śigrus,@} under
<div n="lb"/>the leadership of {@Bḥeda.@} It is, however, at least possible that
<div n="lb"/>in the former passage {@Yadu@} should be read for Yakṣu, or, at
<div n="lb"/>any rate, Yakṣu be deemed a contemptuous substitute of the
<div n="lb"/>name of a possibly un-Āryan or unimportant tribe (as their
<div n="lb"/>allies, the Ajas and Śigrus, clearly were) for the name of the
<div n="lb"/>certainly famous Yadus, as is suggested by Hopkins.<sup>3</sup> {%Cf.%}
