{@Rasā@}¦ is found in three passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> clearly as the
name of a real stream in the extreme north-west of the Vedic
territory. Elsewhere<sup>2</sup> it is the name of a mythic stream at
the ends of the earth, which as well as the atmosphere it
encompasses. It is reasonable to assume that, as in the case of
the {@Sarasvatī,@} the literal is the older sense, and to see in the
river a genuine stream, perhaps originally the Araxes or
Jaxartes, because the Vendidad mentions the Raṅhā, the
Avestan form of Rasā. But the word seems originally to allude
merely to the ‘sap’ or ‘flavour’ of the waters,<sup>3</sup> and so could be
applied to every river, like Sarasvatī.
<F>1) i. 112, 12; v. 53, 9; x. 75, 6. In
v. 53, 9, the phrase {%rasānitabhā%} is found.
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3,
202, is inclined to regard {%anitabhā%} as an
epithet of Rasā, perhaps for {%amitabhā,%}
‘of unmeasured splendour,’ but this is
hardly probable. It seems better to
take Anitabhā as the name of an other-
wise unknown river. {%Cf.%} Max Müller,
