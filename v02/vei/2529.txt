{@Medhātithi,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Medhyātithi@}<sup>2</sup> (‘having a guest at the sacrifice’)
appear to be the names of one and the same man, a descendant
of {@Kaṇva@} and a famous Vedic {@Ṛṣi,@} to whom the authorship of
various hymns<sup>3</sup> is attributed in the Anukramaṇī (Index). To
him Indra is said in the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> to have come in the form
of a ram: this myth is perpetuated in the Subrahmaṇyā
formula<sup>5</sup> recited by the priest while the Soma is being carried
within the sacrificial enclosure, when Indra is hailed as ‘ram
of Medhātithi.’ He appears also as a rival of {@Vatsa,@} whom he
accused of low birth, but who convinced him of his error by
undergoing a fire ordeal ({%cf.%} {@Divya@}).<sup>6</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> he
is mentioned with many other sages, and occurs elsewhere<sup>8</sup>
also as a sage.
<F>1) This is the form of the later texts
and of Rv. viii. 8, 20, where he occurs
with {@Kaṇva.@}</F>
<F>2) This is the usual form in the Rv.:
i. 36, 10. 11. 17; viii. 1, 30; 2, 40;
33, 4; 49, 9; 51, 1; ix. 43, 3.</F>
<F>3) i. 12-23; viii. 1-3; 22. 23; ix. 41-
43. In the ascriptions Medhātithi and
Medhyātithi are confused.</F>
<F>4) viii. 2, 40. {%Cf.%} i. 51, 1, where,
however, there is no mention of Medhā-
ithi.</F>
<F>5) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 79; Ṣaḍ-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 18; Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka, i. 12, 3. Moreover, the
legend is alluded to in the Śāṭyāyanaka.
