{@Bhrātṛ@}¦ is the common designation of ‘brother’ from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards. The word is also applied to a relation or
close friend generally,<sup>2</sup> but here the persons concerned are, it
should be noted, in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> deities, who are brothers of
one another or of the worshipper. Thus in the early literature
the word has not really lost its precise sense. The derivation
from the root {%bhṛ,%} ‘support,’ is probably correct, designating
the brother as the support of his sister. This harmonizes with
the fact that in Vedic literature the brother plays the part of
protector of his sister when bereft of her father, and that
maidens deprived of their brothers ({%abhrātṛ%}) meet an evil fate.<sup>4</sup>
The gradation of the relations in the home is shown by the
order in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>5</sup> where father, mother,
brother, and sister are successively mentioned. Strife between
brothers is occasionally referred to.<sup>6</sup>
