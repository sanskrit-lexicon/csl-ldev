{@Nṛtū@}¦ occurs once in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> denoting a female ‘dancer.’
In another passage<sup>2</sup> Nṛti is found coupled with {%hāsa,%} ‘laughter,’
in the description of the funeral ritual; but though it is clear
that a joyful celebration is meant (like the Irish ‘wake’ or the
[Page1-458+ 47]
old-fashioned feasting in Scotland after a funeral), it is difficult
to be certain that actual dancing is here meant. Dancing is,
however, often referred to in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> and later. Nṛtta-
gīta, ‘dance and song,’ are mentioned in the Jaiminīya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> as found in the sixth world. See also {@Śailūṣa.@}
