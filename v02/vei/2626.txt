{@Ratnin,@}¦ ‘receiving gifts,’ is the term applied to those people
of the royal entourage in whose houses the Ratna-havis, a
[Page2-200+ 48]
special rite, was performed in the course of the {@Rājasūya@} or
‘royal consecration.’ The list given in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup>
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> consists of the Brahman ({%i.e.,%}
the Purohita), the Rājanya, the Mahiṣī (the first wife of the
king), the {@Vāvāta@} (the favourite wife of the king), the Parivṛktī
(the discarded wife), the Senānī, ‘commander of the army’; the
Sūta, ‘charioteer’; the Grāmaṇī, ‘village headman’; the
Kṣattṛ, ‘chamberlain’; the Saṃgrahītṛ, ‘charioteer’ or
‘treasurer’; the Bhāgadugha, ‘collector of taxes’ or ‘divider
of food’; and the Akṣāvāpa, ‘superintender of dicing’ or
‘thrower of dice.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the order is
Senānī; Purohita; Mahisī; Sūta; Grāmaṇī; Kṣattṛ; Saṃ-
grahitṛ; Bhāgadugha; Akṣāvāpa; Go-nikartana, ‘slayer of
cows’ or ‘huntsman’; and Pālāgala, ‘courier’; the ‘discarded
wife’ being mentioned as forbidden to stay at home<sup>4</sup> on the
day of the ceremony of offering a pap for Nirṛti in her house.
In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>5</sup> the list is Brahman ({%i.e.,%} Puro-
hita); Rājan; Mahiṣī; Parivṛktī; Senānī; Saṃgrahītṛ; Kṣattṛ;
Sūta; Vaiśyagrāmaṇī; Bhāgadugha; Takṣa-Rathakārau, ‘car-
penter and chariot-maker’; Akṣāvāpa; and Go-vikarta. The
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> substitutes Go-vyacha for Govikarta, and
omits Takṣa-Rathakārau.
<div n="P"/>It will be seen that the list is essentially that of the royal
household, and of the king's servants in the administration of
the country, though the exact sense of {@Saṃgrahītṛ, Bhāga-@}
{@dugha, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ,@} is open to reasonable doubt,
mainly as to whether public officers or private servants<sup>7</sup> are
meant, for the names are of uncertain significance. A briefer
list of eight {@Vīras,@} ‘heroes,’ as among the friends of the king,
[Page2-201+ 53]
is given in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa:<sup>8</sup> brother, son, Purohita,
Mahiṣī, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ, and Saṃgrahītṛ.

Sūtra, xv. 3, 35, she goes to a Brahmin's
house, where she shares his inviolability
and exemption from jurisdiction.</F>

<F>7) Similarly Akṣāvāpa is either the
man who dices for the king — {%i.e.,%} a
professional dicer who plays with the
king or watches his play — or a public
officer who superintends the gambling
halls of the state and collects the
revenue, as was regularly done later on.
Early English history shows similar
evolution of household officers into
ministers of state.</F>
