{@Ratnin,@}¦ ‘receiving gifts,’ is the term applied to those people
<div n="lb"/>of the royal entourage in whose houses the Ratna-havis, a
[Page2-200+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>special rite, was performed in the course of the {@Rājasūya@} or
<div n="lb"/>‘royal consecration.’ The list given in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> consists of the Brahman ({%i.e.,%}
<div n="lb"/>the Purohita), the Rājanya, the Mahiṣī (the first wife of the
<div n="lb"/>king), the {@Vāvāta@} (the favourite wife of the king), the Parivṛktī
<div n="lb"/>(the discarded wife), the Senānī, ‘commander of the army’; the
<div n="lb"/>Sūta, ‘charioteer’; the Grāmaṇī, ‘village headman’; the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣattṛ, ‘chamberlain’; the Saṃgrahītṛ, ‘charioteer’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘treasurer’; the Bhāgadugha, ‘collector of taxes’ or ‘divider
<div n="lb"/>of food’; and the Akṣāvāpa, ‘superintender of dicing’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘thrower of dice.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the order is
<div n="lb"/>Senānī; Purohita; Mahisī; Sūta; Grāmaṇī; Kṣattṛ; Saṃ-
<div n="lb"/>grahitṛ; Bhāgadugha; Akṣāvāpa; Go-nikartana, ‘slayer of
<div n="lb"/>cows’ or ‘huntsman’; and Pālāgala, ‘courier’; the ‘discarded
<div n="lb"/>wife’ being mentioned as forbidden to stay at home<sup>4</sup> on the
<div n="lb"/>day of the ceremony of offering a pap for Nirṛti in her house.
<div n="lb"/>In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>5</sup> the list is Brahman ({%i.e.,%} Puro-
<div n="lb"/>hita); Rājan; Mahiṣī; Parivṛktī; Senānī; Saṃgrahītṛ; Kṣattṛ;
<div n="lb"/>Sūta; Vaiśyagrāmaṇī; Bhāgadugha; Takṣa-Rathakārau, ‘car-
<div n="lb"/>penter and chariot-maker’; Akṣāvāpa; and Go-vikarta. The
<div n="lb"/>Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> substitutes Go-vyacha for Govikarta, and
<div n="lb"/>omits Takṣa-Rathakārau.
<div n="P"/>It will be seen that the list is essentially that of the royal
<div n="lb"/>household, and of the king's servants in the administration of
<div n="lb"/>the country, though the exact sense of {@Saṃgrahītṛ, Bhāga-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@dugha, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ,@} is open to reasonable doubt,
<div n="lb"/>mainly as to whether public officers or private servants<sup>7</sup> are
<div n="lb"/>meant, for the names are of uncertain significance. A briefer
<div n="lb"/>list of eight {@Vīras,@} ‘heroes,’ as among the friends of the king,
[Page2-201+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>is given in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa:<sup>8</sup> brother, son, Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>Mahiṣī, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ, and Saṃgrahītṛ.

<div n="lb"/>Sūtra, xv. 3, 35, she goes to a Brahmin's
<div n="lb"/>house, where she shares his inviolability

<F>7) Similarly Akṣāvāpa is either the
<div n="lb"/>man who dices for the king — {%i.e.,%} a
<div n="lb"/>professional dicer who plays with the
<div n="lb"/>king or watches his play — or a public
<div n="lb"/>officer who superintends the gambling
<div n="lb"/>halls of the state and collects the
<div n="lb"/>revenue, as was regularly done later on.
<div n="lb"/>Early English history shows similar
<div n="lb"/>evolution of household officers into
<div n="lb"/>ministers of state.</F>
