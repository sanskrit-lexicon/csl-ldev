{@Aṅgārāvakṣayaṇa.@}¦ — A word of doubtful meaning found
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> It is rendered ‘tongs’ by
Max Müller and Böhtlingk in their translations. The St.
Petersburg Dictionary explains it as ‘a vessel in which coals
are extinguished,’ and Monier-Williams as ‘an instrument for
extinguishing coals.’ The smaller St. Petersburg Dictionary
renders the word ‘coal-shovel or tongs.’ {%Cf.%} {@Ulmukāva-@}
