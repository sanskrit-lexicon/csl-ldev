3. {@Kṛṣṇa Devakī-putra@}¦ is mentioned in the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad<sup>1</sup> as a pupil of the mythical {@Ghora Āṅgirasa.@}
Tradition,<sup>2</sup> and several modern writers like Grierson, Garbe,
and von Schroeder, recognize in him the hero Kṛṣṇa, who later
is deified. In their view he is a Kṣatriya teacher of morals, as
opposed to Brahminism.<sup>3</sup> This is extremely doubtful. It
appears better either to regard the coincidence of name as
accidental, or to suppose that the reference is a piece of
Euhemerism. To identify this Kṛṣṇa with the preceding,
as does the St. Petersburg Dictionary, seems to be quite
groundless.
