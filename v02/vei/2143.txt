{@Balāsa@}¦ is the name of a disease mentioned several times in
the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and occasionally later.<sup>2</sup> Mahīdhara<sup>3</sup> and
Sāyaṇa<sup>4</sup> interpret the term as ‘consumption.’ Zimmer<sup>5</sup> supports
this view on the ground that it is mentioned<sup>6</sup> as a kind of
{@Yakṣma,@} makes the bones and joints fall apart ({%asthi-sraṃsa,%}
{%paruḥ-sraṃsa%}),<sup>7</sup> and is caused by love, aversion, and the heart,<sup>8</sup>
characteristics which agree with the statements of the later
Hindu medicine.<sup>9</sup> It is in keeping with a demon of the
character of consumption that Balāsa should appear as an
accompaniment of Takman.<sup>10</sup> Grohmann,<sup>11</sup> however, thought
[Page2-062+ 50]
that a ‘sore’ or ‘swelling’ (in the case of fever caused by
dropsy) was meant. Bloomfield<sup>12</sup> considers that the question
is still open. Ludwig<sup>13</sup> renders the word by ‘dropsy.’
<div n="P"/>As remedies against the disease the salve ({@Āñjasa@}) from
{@Trikakud@}<sup>14</sup> and the {@Jaṅgiḍa@}<sup>15</sup> plant are mentioned.
