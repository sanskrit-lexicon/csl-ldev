{@Aṣṭa-karṇī@}¦ is an expression which occurs in one passage of
the Ṛigveda,<sup>1</sup> and which Roth<sup>2</sup> was at first inclined to interpret
[Page1-046+ 46]
as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that
it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The
exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain.
Roth<sup>3</sup> was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced
ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pāṇini<sup>4</sup>
({%bhinna-karṇa, chinna-karṇa%}). Grassmann's more obvious
rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’
is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on
the ear’ ({%karkari-karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’
({%dātra-karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ ({%sthūṇā-%}
{%karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the ears bored’ ({%chidra-karṇyaḥ%}), and {%viṣtya-%}
{%karṇyaḥ,%} given in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>5</sup> The simple mean-
ing, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same
passage of the Maitrāyaṇī, where the verb {%akṣ%} occurs in the
sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the
Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility.
<div n="P"/>The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is
twice referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>6</sup> The mark is termed
{%lakṣman,%}<sup>7</sup> and was made with a copper-knife<sup>8</sup> ({%lohita%}). The
Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>9</sup> forbids the use of an arrow-shaft ({%tejana%}),
or of iron, but permits that of a stem of sugar-cane ({%ikṣu-kāṇḍa%})
or copper.
