{@Tāyu@}¦ was another name for thief, perhaps of a less
distinguished and more domestic character than the highway-
man, for though he is referred to as a cattle-thief,<sup>13</sup> he is also
alluded to as a stealer of clothes ({%vastra-mathi%})<sup>14</sup> and as a
debtor.<sup>15</sup> In one passage the Tāyus are said to disappear at
the coming of dawn (which is elsewhere called {%yāvayad-dveṣas,%}
‘driving away hostile beings,’ and {%ṛta-pā,%} ‘guardian of order’),
like the stars of heaven ({%nakṣatra%}).<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Śatarudriya litany of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup> Rudra
is called lord of assailers ({%ā-vyādhin%}), thieves ({%stena%}), robbers
({%taskara%}), pickpockets ({%stāyu%}), stealers ({%muṣṇant%}), and cutters
({%vi-kṛnta%}); and designations of sharpers ({%gṛtsa%}) and bands
({%gaṇa, vrāta%}), apparently of robbers, are mentioned.<sup>18</sup> It is
therefore not surprising that the Rigveda<sup>19</sup> should contain
many prayers for safety at home or on the way, or that
the Atharvaveda should devote several hymns to night<sup>20</sup>
chiefly for protection against the evil doings of thieves and
robbers.
<div n="P"/>Pischel<sup>21</sup> suggests that in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>22</sup>
{@Vasiṣṭha@} is represented as a burglar, but the admits that, since
Vasiṣṭha was attacking the house of his father Varuṇa, he was
only seeking to obtain what he may have regarded as his own.
But the interpretation of the hymn is not certain.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sāyaṇa's explanation of one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> as
[Page1-304+ 60]
referring to professional cattle-trackers, like the Khojis of the
Panjab, seems quite probable.<sup>25</sup>
<div n="P"/>The punishment of thieves appears primarily to have been
left to the action of the robbed. The practice of binding them
in stocks<sup>26</sup> seems clearly referred to. But later, at any rate — 
and in all probability earlier also, as in other countries — a more
severe penalty could be exacted, and death inflicted by the
king.<sup>27</sup> There is no hint in Vedic literature of the mode of
conviction; a fire ordeal is not known to the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup>
and the ordeal known to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>29</sup> is not said
to be used in the case of theft. No doubt the stolen property
was recovered by the person robbed if he could obtain it.
Nothing is known as to what happened if the property had
passed from the actual thief into the possession of another
person.

are cited by Zimmer, 181, 182, to prove
this practice. But it must be noted that
Rv. vii. 86, 5, alone is not at all con-
clusive evidence, though Av. xix. 47, 9;
50, 1 ({%drupade āhan%}), probably mean the
same thing. Whitney, Translation of
the Atharvaveda, 976, 983, renders the
passages as referring to casting a thief
into a snare, and Pischel, {%Vedische%}
{%Studien,%} 1, 106, makes Rv. vii. 86, 5,
refer to the cattle-thief ({%paśu-tṛp%}) taking
away the rope from the calf he means
to steal. For Rv. x. 4, 6, see above,
n. 10. The German and Slavonic
parallels cited by Zimmer, 182, n.,
support his view. See also for a similar
punishment in case of debt, {@Ṛṇa.@}</F>
