{@Tāyu@}¦ was another name for thief, perhaps of a less
<div n="lb"/>distinguished and more domestic character than the highway-
<div n="lb"/>man, for though he is referred to as a cattle-thief,<sup>13</sup> he is also
<div n="lb"/>alluded to as a stealer of clothes ({%vastra-mathi%})<sup>14</sup> and as a
<div n="lb"/>debtor.<sup>15</sup> In one passage the Tāyus are said to disappear at
<div n="lb"/>the coming of dawn (which is elsewhere called {%yāvayad-dveṣas,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘driving away hostile beings,’ and {%ṛta-pā,%} ‘guardian of order’),
<div n="lb"/>like the stars of heaven ({%nakṣatra%}).<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Śatarudriya litany of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup> Rudra
<div n="lb"/>is called lord of assailers ({%ā-vyādhin%}), thieves ({%stena%}), robbers
<div n="lb"/>({%taskara%}), pickpockets ({%stāyu%}), stealers ({%muṣṇant%}), and cutters
<div n="lb"/>({%vi-kṛnta%}); and designations of sharpers ({%gṛtsa%}) and bands
<div n="lb"/>({%gaṇa, vrāta%}), apparently of robbers, are mentioned.<sup>18</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>therefore not surprising that the Rigveda<sup>19</sup> should contain
<div n="lb"/>many prayers for safety at home or on the way, or that
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda should devote several hymns to night<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>chiefly for protection against the evil doings of thieves and
<div n="lb"/>robbers.
<div n="P"/>Pischel<sup>21</sup> suggests that in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{@Vasiṣṭha@} is represented as a burglar, but the admits that, since
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha was attacking the house of his father Varuṇa, he was
<div n="lb"/>only seeking to obtain what he may have regarded as his own.
<div n="lb"/>But the interpretation of the hymn is not certain.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sāyaṇa's explanation of one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> as
[Page1-304+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>referring to professional cattle-trackers, like the Khojis of the
<div n="lb"/>Panjab, seems quite probable.<sup>25</sup>
<div n="P"/>The punishment of thieves appears primarily to have been
<div n="lb"/>left to the action of the robbed. The practice of binding them
<div n="lb"/>in stocks<sup>26</sup> seems clearly referred to. But later, at any rate — 
<div n="lb"/>and in all probability earlier also, as in other countries — a more
<div n="lb"/>severe penalty could be exacted, and death inflicted by the
<div n="lb"/>king.<sup>27</sup> There is no hint in Vedic literature of the mode of
<div n="lb"/>conviction; a fire ordeal is not known to the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the ordeal known to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>29</sup> is not said
<div n="lb"/>to be used in the case of theft. No doubt the stolen property
<div n="lb"/>was recovered by the person robbed if he could obtain it.
<div n="lb"/>Nothing is known as to what happened if the property had
<div n="lb"/>passed from the actual thief into the possession of another
<div n="lb"/>person.
