{@Aṅga.@}¦ — The name occurs only once in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> in
connection with the {@Gandhāris, Mūjavants,@} and {@Magadhas,@} as
distinct peoples. They appear also in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup>
in the compound name {%Aṅga-magadhāḥ.%} As in later times they
were settled on the Sone and Ganges,<sup>3</sup> their earlier seat was
presumably there also. See also {@Vaṅga.@}

{%Asiatic Society,%} 1908, 852, inclines to
regard them as a non-Aryan people
that came over-sea to Eastern India.
There is nothing in the Vedic litera-
