{@Pratīpa Prātisatvana,@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Prātisutvana,@}<sup>2</sup> is the name of a
man mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda.<sup>2</sup> Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> with
great ingenuity, compares the fact that {@Parikṣit@} is mentioned
as a {@Kuru@} king in the Atharvaveda,<sup>4</sup> and that, according to the
Epic genealogies, his grandson was Pratiśravas, with which
name Prātisutvana, as very possibly a Prākritized version of
Prātiśrutvana may be compared, and his great-grandson was
Pratīpa. The identification cannot, however, be regarded as at
all certain, and while the Epic may have derived its genealogy
from the Atharvaveda, it may have preserved an independent
tradition. Böhtlingk<sup>5</sup> renders {%prātisatvanam%} as ‘in the direction
opposed to the Satvans’, and this may be right.
