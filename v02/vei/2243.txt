{@Bhalānas,@}¦ plural, is the name in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> of one of the five
tribes, {@Pakthas,@} Bhalānases, {@Alinas, Viṣāṇins,@} and {@Śivas,@} who
are mentioned as ranged on the side<sup>2</sup> of the enemies of {@Sudās@}
in the battle of the ten kings ({@Dāśarājña@}), not opposed to
them, as Roth,<sup>3</sup> and at one time Zimmer,<sup>4</sup> thought. Zimmer<sup>5</sup>
suggests as their original home East Kabulistan, comparing the
name of the Bolan pass. This seems a reasonably probable
view.

the form of the name to be Bhalāna
(but the text of the Rv. has {%bhalānăsaḥ%}),
and who overlooks Zimmer's later view.</F>
