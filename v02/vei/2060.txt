{@Prācya@}¦ denotes in the plural ‘dwellers in the east.’ They
are mentioned in the list of peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup>
It is very probable that the {@Kāśis, Kosalas, Videhas,@} and
perhaps {@Magadhas,@} are meant, as Oldenberg<sup>2</sup> supposes. In
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the Easterns are said to call Agni
by the name of Śarva, and their mode of making tombs is
there<sup>4</sup> referred to with disapproval. The Lāṭyāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>5</sup> explains the {@Vipatha,@} ‘rough car,’ of the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> as a car of the Easterns ({%prācya-ratha%}). In the
Saṃhitopaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> reference is made to the Prācya-
Pāñcālas.
