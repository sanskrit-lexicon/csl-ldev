1. {@Vadhū@}¦ is a frequent word for ‘woman’ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and later.<sup>2</sup> It denotes, according to Delbrück,<sup>3</sup> the woman as
<div n="lb"/>either married or as seeking a husband, or as a bride in the
<div n="lb"/>wedding ceremony. The word appears to be derived from a
<div n="lb"/>form of the root {%vah,%} ‘to carry,’ as is {%vahatu,%} ‘the bridal pro-
<div n="lb"/>cession,’ thus meaning ‘she who is to be or has been conducted
<div n="lb"/>home.’ Zimmer,<sup>4</sup> however, objects to this explanation,
<div n="lb"/>regarding {%vadhū%} as a derivative from a different root meaning
<div n="lb"/>‘to marry.’
