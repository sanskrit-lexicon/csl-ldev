{@Alina@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned once only in the
Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> Roth<sup>2</sup> thought that the Alinas were allies — possibly
a subdivision — of the {@Tṛtsus.@} Ludwig<sup>3</sup> more probably thinks
that they were defeated by {@Sudās,@} together with the {@Pakthas,@}
{@Bhalānas, Śivas,@} and {@Viṣāṇins,@} with whom they are mentioned,
at the {@Paruṣṇī;@} and Zimmer<sup>4</sup> suggests that they lived to the
north-east of Kafiristan.
