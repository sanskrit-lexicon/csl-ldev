{@Śunaḥ-śepa,@}¦ ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a man with the
patronymic {@Ājīgarti.@} According to a tale told in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>2</sup> he was
purchased as a victim by {@Rohita,@} King {@Hariścandra's@} son,
who had been promised by his father to Varuṇa as a sacrifice.
He was actually bound to the stake, but was released in time
through his supplications, supposed to be preserved in certain
hymns of the Rigveda.<sup>3</sup> He was adopted by {@Viśvāmitra,@} to
whose advice he owed the inspiration to ask the gods to release
him, and became his son as {@Devarāta,@} much to the annoyance
[Page2-386+ 44]
of some of Viśvāmitra's sons, who in consequence were cursed
by their father. The Rigveda, however, contains merely the
statement of Śunaḥśepa's deliverance from peril of death by
the divine help, and the Yajurvedas<sup>4</sup> simply say that he was
seized by Varuṇa (perhaps with dropsy),<sup>5</sup> but saved himself from
Varuṇa's bonds.
