{@Śunaḥ-śepa,@}¦ ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a man with the
<div n="lb"/>patronymic {@Ājīgarti.@} According to a tale told in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>2</sup> he was
<div n="lb"/>purchased as a victim by {@Rohita,@} King {@Hariścandra's@} son,
<div n="lb"/>who had been promised by his father to Varuṇa as a sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>He was actually bound to the stake, but was released in time
<div n="lb"/>through his supplications, supposed to be preserved in certain
<div n="lb"/>hymns of the Rigveda.<sup>3</sup> He was adopted by {@Viśvāmitra,@} to
<div n="lb"/>whose advice he owed the inspiration to ask the gods to release
<div n="lb"/>him, and became his son as {@Devarāta,@} much to the annoyance
[Page2-386+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>of some of Viśvāmitra's sons, who in consequence were cursed
<div n="lb"/>by their father. The Rigveda, however, contains merely the
<div n="lb"/>statement of Śunaḥśepa's deliverance from peril of death by
<div n="lb"/>the divine help, and the Yajurvedas<sup>4</sup> simply say that he was
<div n="lb"/>seized by Varuṇa (perhaps with dropsy),<sup>5</sup> but saved himself from
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa's bonds.
