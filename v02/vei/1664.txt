{@Pati, Patnī.@}¦ — Under these words denoting primarily, as the
<div n="lb"/>evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows,
<div n="lb"/>‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient
<div n="lb"/>to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Marriage.%} — Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears
<div n="lb"/>essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This
<div n="lb"/>is shown by the numerous references<sup>1</sup> to unmarried girls who
<div n="lb"/>grow old in the house of their fathers ({%amā-jur%}), and who adorn
<div n="lb"/>themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia
<div n="lb"/>of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition<sup>2</sup> to
<div n="lb"/>compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>3</sup> itself seems to present us with a spell by which a
[Page1-475+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his
<div n="lb"/>beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the Sūtra period,
<div n="lb"/>though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage
<div n="lb"/>before puberty there obtained.<sup>4</sup> The marriage ritual also quite
<div n="lb"/>clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal
<div n="lb"/>one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her
<div n="lb"/>husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Limitations on Marriage.%} — It is difficult to say with certainty
<div n="lb"/>within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of
<div n="lb"/>Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems clearly to point to a
<div n="lb"/>prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can
<div n="lb"/>hardly be said, as Weber<sup>7</sup> thinks, to point to a practice that
<div n="lb"/>was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>8</sup> and the Dharma Sūtras<sup>9</sup> are found prohibitions
<div n="lb"/>against marriage in the {@Gotra@} (‘family’) or within six degrees
<div n="lb"/>on the mother's or father's side, but in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>10</sup> marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation,
<div n="lb"/>the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin,<sup>11</sup> by the
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇvas, and the second by the Saurāṣṭras, while the Dākṣi-
<div n="lb"/>ṇātyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's
<div n="lb"/>brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not
<div n="lb"/>with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the
<div n="lb"/>father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the
<div n="lb"/>Gotra cannot then have existed,<sup>12</sup> though naturally marriages
[Page1-476+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>outside the Gotra were frequent.<sup>13</sup> Similarity of caste was also
<div n="lb"/>not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even
<div n="lb"/>by the Dharma Sūtras,<sup>14</sup> so that a Brāhmaṇa could marry
<div n="lb"/>wives of any lower caste, a Kṣatriya wives of the two lowest
<div n="lb"/>castes as well as of his own caste, a Vaiśya a Śūdrā as well as
<div n="lb"/>a Vaiśyā, although the Śūdrā marriages were later disapproved
<div n="lb"/>{%in toto.%} Instances of such intermarriage are common in the
<div n="lb"/>Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was considered proper that the younger brothers and
<div n="lb"/>sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before
<div n="lb"/>them. The later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas<sup>16</sup> present a series
<div n="lb"/>of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful
<div n="lb"/>those who bear them. These terms are the {%pari-vividāna,%}<sup>17</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>perhaps {%agre-dadhus,%}<sup>18</sup> the man who, though a younger brother,
<div n="lb"/>marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the
<div n="lb"/>{%parivitta;%}<sup>19</sup> the {%agre-didhiṣu,%}<sup>20</sup> the man who weds a younger
<div n="lb"/>daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Didhiṣū-pati,@}<sup>21</sup> who is the husband of the latter. The passages
<div n="lb"/>do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always
<div n="lb"/>be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order
<div n="lb"/>was often broken.
<div n="P"/>{%Widow Remarriage.%} — The remarriage of a widow was
[Page1-477+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the
<div n="lb"/>form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other
<div n="lb"/>nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children.
<div n="lb"/>At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral
<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda;<sup>22</sup> for the alternative explanation, which
<div n="lb"/>sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Puruṣamendha
<div n="lb"/>(‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt<sup>23</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Delbrück,<sup>24</sup> is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is
<div n="lb"/>supported by the Sūtra evidence.<sup>25</sup> Moreover, another passage
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda<sup>26</sup> clearly refers to the marriage of the widow
<div n="lb"/>and the husband's brother ({%devṛ%}), which constitutes what the
<div n="lb"/>Indians later knew as Niyoga.<sup>27</sup> This custom was probably
<div n="lb"/>not followed except in cases where no son was already born.
<div n="lb"/>This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since
<div n="lb"/>the brother might — so far as appears — be already married
<div n="lb"/>himself. In the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup> a verse refers to a charm which
<div n="lb"/>would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her
<div n="lb"/>second husband. Though, as Delbrück<sup>29</sup> thinks, this very
<div n="lb"/>possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still
<div n="lb"/>alive,<sup>30</sup> but was impotent or had lost caste ({%patita%}),<sup>31</sup> still it is
<div n="lb"/>certain that the later Dharma Sūtras<sup>32</sup> began to recognize
<div n="lb"/>ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband.
[Page1-478+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>33</sup> finds some evidence in the Rigveda<sup>34</sup> to the effect
<div n="lb"/>that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and
<div n="lb"/>could not be found or heard of.
<div n="P"/>{%Polygamy.%} — A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife.
<div n="lb"/>This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda;<sup>35</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Manu, according to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup> had ten wives;
<div n="lb"/>and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>37</sup> explains polygamy by a
<div n="lb"/>characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four
<div n="lb"/>wives attributed to him, the Mahiṣī,<sup>38</sup> the Parivṛktī,<sup>39</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Vāvātā,<sup>40</sup> and the Pālāgalī.<sup>41</sup> The Mahiṣī appears to be the
<div n="lb"/>chief wife, being the first one married according to the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>42</sup> The Parivṛktī, ‘the neglected,’ is explained
<div n="lb"/>by Weber<sup>43</sup> and Pischel<sup>44</sup> as one that has had no son. The
<div n="lb"/>Vāvātā is ‘the favourite,’ while the Pālāgalī is, according to
<div n="lb"/>Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The
<div n="lb"/>names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence
<div n="lb"/>points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest
<div n="lb"/>sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by
[Page1-479+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Delbrück,<sup>45</sup> that in the sacrifice the Patnī is usually mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mytho-
<div n="lb"/>logical reason.<sup>46</sup> Zimmer<sup>47</sup> is of opinion that polygamy is
<div n="lb"/>dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed
<div n="lb"/>from polygamy; Weber,<sup>48</sup> however, thinks that polygamy is
<div n="lb"/>secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthro-
<div n="lb"/>pology.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Polyandry.%} — On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic.<sup>50</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There is no passage containing any clear reference to such
<div n="lb"/>a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda<sup>51</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Atharvaveda<sup>52</sup> verses are occasionally found in which
<div n="lb"/>husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is
<div n="lb"/>difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate
<div n="lb"/>instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's<sup>53</sup>
<div n="lb"/>view, that the plural is here used {%majestatis causā,%} is not
<div n="lb"/>accepted, Delbrück's<sup>54</sup> explanation by mythology is probably
<div n="lb"/>right. In other passages<sup>55</sup> the plural is simply generic.
<div n="P"/>{%Marital Relations.%} — Despite polygamy, however, there is
<div n="lb"/>ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber<sup>56</sup> has
<div n="lb"/>suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife
<div n="lb"/>was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's
<div n="lb"/>being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several
[Page1-480+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>passages,<sup>57</sup> indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence,
<div n="lb"/>intercourse with the {%strī%} of another. This may imply that
<div n="lb"/>adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as
<div n="lb"/>venial. But as the word {%strī%} includes all the ‘womenfolk,’
<div n="lb"/>daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly
<div n="lb"/>be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was
<div n="lb"/>normally regarded with indifference.<sup>58</sup> The curious ritual of
<div n="lb"/>the Varuṇapraghāsās,<sup>59</sup> in which the wife of the sacrificer is
<div n="lb"/>questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbrück<sup>60</sup> to be a
<div n="lb"/>part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife,
<div n="lb"/>not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife.
<div n="lb"/>Again, Yājñavalkya's doctrine in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>61</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste
<div n="lb"/>({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not, really means that no one cares if the wife
<div n="lb"/>is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of
<div n="lb"/>the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in
<div n="lb"/>question. Monogamy is also evidently approved,<sup>62</sup> so that
<div n="lb"/>some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to
<div n="lb"/>other Indo-Germanic<sup>63</sup> peoples that the adulterer taken in the
<div n="lb"/>act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature
<div n="lb"/>has traces of this rule.<sup>64</sup> There is also abundant evidence that
<div n="lb"/>the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high.
<div n="P"/>{%Hetairai.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>65</sup> there are many references to
<div n="lb"/>illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of
[Page1-481+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>such unions,<sup>66</sup> especially in the case of a protégé of Indra,
<div n="lb"/>often mentioned as the {%parāvṛkta%} or {%parāvṛj.%}<sup>67</sup> The ‘son of
<div n="lb"/>a maiden’ ({%kumārī-putra%}) is already spoken of in the Vājasaneyi
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā.<sup>68</sup> Such a person appears with a metronymic in the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad period:<sup>69</sup> this custom may be the origin of metro-
<div n="lb"/>nymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists
<div n="lb"/>of teachers (Vaṃśas) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>70</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> refers to illicit unions of Śūdra and Ārya,
<div n="lb"/>both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at
<div n="lb"/>the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose desig-
<div n="lb"/>nations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ ({%atītvarī%})<sup>72</sup> and ‘procuress
<div n="lb"/>of abortion’ ({%atiṣkadvarī%}),<sup>73</sup> while the ‘dyeing woman’ ({%rajayitrī%})
<div n="lb"/>is dedicated to sensuality.<sup>74</sup> Pischel and Geldner also see
<div n="lb"/>many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>75</sup>
<div n="lb"/>especially where mention is made of Uṣas, the goddess of
<div n="lb"/>Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any
<div n="lb"/>rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ ({%nṛtū%}) referred to in
<div n="lb"/>one passage of the Rigveda<sup>76</sup> was a Hetaira. When women
<div n="lb"/>are referred to as going to the {@Samana,@} or ‘place of meeting,’
<div n="lb"/>Hetairai are probably also meant.<sup>77</sup> Grave cases of immorality
<div n="lb"/>are alluded to in the Rigveda.<sup>78</sup> The love of father and
<div n="lb"/>daughter, as shown in the myth of Prajāpati,<sup>79</sup> is evidently
<div n="lb"/>censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is
<div n="lb"/>recognized in the Atharvaveda.<sup>80</sup> Girls who had lost their
[Page1-482+ 76]
<div n="lb"/>natural protectors — father or brother<sup>81</sup> — were apt to be reduced
<div n="lb"/>to live by immorality.
<div n="P"/>{%Forms of Marriage.%} — The state of society revealed in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part
<div n="lb"/>of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband.
<div n="lb"/>At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother
<div n="lb"/>controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age,<sup>82</sup>
<div n="lb"/>though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suit-
<div n="lb"/>able match.<sup>83</sup> The marriage was frequently arranged through
<div n="lb"/>an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ ({%vara%}),<sup>84</sup> presumably after those
<div n="lb"/>concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of
<div n="lb"/>a daughter was not unknown,<sup>85</sup> but a certain amount of dis-
<div n="lb"/>credit would seem to have attached to it,<sup>86</sup> and sons-in-law in
<div n="lb"/>such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries
<div n="lb"/>were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels
<div n="lb"/>Suffered from bodily defects.<sup>87</sup> Occasionally marriages by
[Page1-483+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as
<div n="lb"/>when {@Vimada@} carried off {@Purumitra's@} daughter against her
<div n="lb"/>father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent.<sup>88</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various
<div n="lb"/>forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types:
<div n="lb"/>({%a%}) that which is based on mutual consent, the {%prājāpatya%}
<div n="lb"/>(‘connected with Prajāpati’); ({%b%}) that in which a price is paid
<div n="lb"/>for the bride, the {%āsura%} (‘Asura-like’), {%ārṣa%} (‘connected with
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛṣis’), {%brāhma%} (‘relating to Brahman’), or {%daiva%} (‘divine’);
<div n="lb"/>({%c%}) those which consist in stealing the bride, the {%kṣātra%}
<div n="lb"/>(‘warrior-like’) or the {%rākṣasa%} (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of
<div n="lb"/>which traces are found in Vedic literature.<sup>89</sup> For instance,
<div n="lb"/>the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is
<div n="lb"/>exemplified in the story of {@Cyavana@} in the Jaiminīya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa,<sup>90</sup> and in that of {@Śyāvāśva@} in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>91</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wedding Ceremony.%} — In normal marriages the bridal was
<div n="lb"/>celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials
<div n="lb"/>and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by
<div n="lb"/>other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples,<sup>92</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness
<div n="lb"/>of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house,<sup>93</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired,
<div n="lb"/>and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride.<sup>94</sup>
<div n="lb"/>A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests.<sup>95</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone,
<div n="lb"/>formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household
[Page1-484+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>fire.<sup>96</sup> This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence
<div n="lb"/>being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ ({%hasta-grābha%}).<sup>97</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>festivities being over,<sup>98</sup> the bridegroom took the bride to his
<div n="lb"/>home on a car in a marriage procession,<sup>99</sup> all to the accom-
<div n="lb"/>paniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wife's Property and Status.%} — We have very little information
<div n="lb"/>as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage.
<div n="lb"/>It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's
<div n="lb"/>dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the
<div n="lb"/>Epic<sup>101</sup> the rise of the recognition of women's property as
<div n="lb"/>their own ({%strī-dhana%}) is only slow. That the husband was
<div n="lb"/>absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though
<div n="lb"/>he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was
<div n="lb"/>expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law.
<div n="lb"/>The poetical ideal<sup>102</sup> of the family was decidedly high, and we
<div n="lb"/>have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an
<div n="lb"/>honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress
<div n="lb"/>in her husband's home, exercising authority over her father-
<div n="lb"/>in-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters.<sup>103</sup>
<div n="lb"/>No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son
[Page1-485+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude<sup>104</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress
<div n="lb"/>of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still
<div n="lb"/>unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress else-
<div n="lb"/>where<sup>105</sup> laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then
<div n="lb"/>is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties,
<div n="lb"/>and controls the house while his son continues to live with
<div n="lb"/>him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son
<div n="lb"/>had set up a separate family of his own.<sup>106</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings
<div n="lb"/>of the husband. In this connexion the term {@Patnī@} regularly
<div n="lb"/>applies to her in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>107</sup> where {@Jāyā@} designates her
<div n="lb"/>in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>108</sup> describes a certain ceremony in which
<div n="lb"/>the wife ({%jāyā%}) alone offered the oblation in former times, while
<div n="lb"/>later a priest might do so instead. The same Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women,
<div n="lb"/>probably due to the growing sense of the importance of cere-
<div n="lb"/>monial priority.<sup>109</sup> So in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>110</sup> women
<div n="lb"/>generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils,
<div n="lb"/>and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’<sup>111</sup> and connected with
<div n="lb"/>Nirṛti, ‘calamity.’<sup>112</sup> A woman too, according to the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā,<sup>113</sup> is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic
<div n="lb"/>reference is made in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>114</sup> to her power of
[Page1-486+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the
<div n="lb"/>other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is
<div n="lb"/>half her husband,<sup>115</sup> and completes him;<sup>116</sup> and in the Rigveda<sup>117</sup>
<div n="lb"/>attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their
<div n="lb"/>good qualities. None the less, the Brāhmaṇas clearly indicate
<div n="lb"/>a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the
<div n="lb"/>rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband.<sup>118</sup> Scolds
<div n="lb"/>were also known: the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>119</sup> praises the wife
<div n="lb"/>‘who does not answer back’ ({%aprativādinī%}). Women bore no
<div n="lb"/>part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the
<div n="lb"/>Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>120</sup> expressly says. On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>with the advance of education, women shared in the intel-
<div n="lb"/>lectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Yājñavalkya's<sup>121</sup>
<div n="lb"/>two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical
<div n="lb"/>discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to
<div n="lb"/>in the Upaniṣads as teachers, but whether they were married
<div n="lb"/>is not certain.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the main object of a woman's marriage was the pro-
<div n="lb"/>duction of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda and later.<sup>123</sup> The desire for offspring, as was natural
<div n="lb"/>in a society which mainly counted relationship through the
<div n="lb"/>father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the
<div n="lb"/>necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line.
<div n="lb"/>It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda<sup>124</sup>
<div n="lb"/>this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice
[Page1-487+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>is recognized,<sup>125</sup> as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the
<div n="lb"/>appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of
<div n="lb"/>a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonless-
<div n="lb"/>ness’ ({%avīratā%}) is placed on the same level as lack of property
<div n="lb"/>({%amati%}), and Agni is besought to protect from it.<sup>126</sup> The birth
<div n="lb"/>of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>127</sup> in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son,
<div n="lb"/>and deprecates that of a daughter, while the Aitareya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>128</sup> contains an old verse which says that a daughter is
<div n="lb"/>a misery ({%kṛpaṇam%}), while a son is a light in the highest heaven
<div n="lb"/>({%jyotir ha putraḥ parame vyoman%}). But there is no proof that
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children.
<div n="lb"/>This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās<sup>129</sup> by Zimmer<sup>130</sup> and Delbrück,<sup>131</sup> has been disproved
<div n="lb"/>by Böhtlingk.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Life.%} — No doubt the care of a child was left to
<div n="lb"/>the mother, but we learn little from the earlier litera-
<div n="lb"/>ture<sup>132</sup> of the life of the young. The length of the period
<div n="lb"/>of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar)
<div n="lb"/>months.<sup>133</sup> On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee,
<div n="lb"/>and then given the breast.<sup>134</sup> On the eighth day after birth
[Page1-488+ 78]
<div n="lb"/>the infant was washed.<sup>135</sup> The cutting of the teeth was also
<div n="lb"/>a solemn occasion,<sup>136</sup> and is the subject of a hymn in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning
<div n="lb"/>to speak, which the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>137</sup> ascribes to the end
<div n="lb"/>of the first year of life. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>138</sup> asserts that
<div n="lb"/>the words {@Tata@} and {@Tāta,@} onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’<sup>139</sup>
<div n="lb"/>are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps
<div n="lb"/>an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda<sup>140</sup>
<div n="lb"/>further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the
<div n="lb"/>first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name
<div n="lb"/>was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often
<div n="lb"/>added.<sup>141</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Satī.%} — On the death of her husband, in some cases the
<div n="lb"/>widow burned herself or was burned by his relations.<sup>142</sup> This
<div n="lb"/>is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda.<sup>143</sup> On the other hand, the Rigveda does not
<div n="lb"/>contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary con-
<div n="lb"/>siders the widow as married apparently to the brother of the
<div n="lb"/>dead man.<sup>144</sup> The custom of Suttee would therefore appear
<div n="lb"/>during the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as
<div n="lb"/>a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been
<div n="lb"/>mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge
<div n="lb"/>from the other Indo-Germanic parallels.<sup>145</sup> In other classes
[Page1-489+ 31]
