{@Tārkṣya@}¦ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a divine steed,
<div n="lb"/>apparently the sun conceived as a horse.<sup>2</sup> But Foy,<sup>3</sup> judging
<div n="lb"/>by the name, apparently a patronymic of {@Tṛkṣi,@} who is known
<div n="lb"/>from the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> onwards as a descendant of {@Trasadasyu,@}
<div n="lb"/>thinks that a real steed, the property of Tṛkṣi, is meant; but
<div n="lb"/>this is not very probable.<sup>5</sup> See also {@Tārukṣya.@}

<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 13, he
<div n="lb"/>appears as Vaipaśyata (Vaipaścita in
