{@Dakṣiṇā@}¦ appears repeatedly in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> as the
designation of the gift presented to priests at the sacrifice,
apparently because a cow — a prolific ({%dakṣiṇā%}) one — was the
usual ‘fee’<sup>3</sup> on such an occasion.<sup>4</sup> The later Dāna-stutis, or
‘Praises of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda immensely exaggerate these
donations, and the exaggeration grows in the Brāhmaṇas. It
is important to notice that these enumerations of gifts in the
main include nothing but articles of personal property, such as
kine, horses, buffaloes, or camels ({%uṣṭra%}), ornaments, and so
forth, but not land.<sup>5</sup> Reference is, however, made in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> to land as a Dakṣiṇā, but with dis-
approval, probably because the land came to be regarded as
inalienable without the consent of the clansmen.<sup>7</sup>
<F>1) A whole hymn, Rv. x. 107, is
devoted to its praise. {%Cf.%} i. 168, 7; vi.
27, 8; viii. 24, 29; 39, 5; x. 62, 1, etc.</F>
<F>2) Av. iv. 11, 4; v. 7, 11; xi. 7, 9;
8, 22; xiii. 1, 52; xviii. 4, 8, etc.;
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 3, 1; 8, 1, 1;
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 19, 23; xix. 30;
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3 {%et seq.;%}
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 3, 1 {%et seq.%}
The verses ({%gāthā nārāśaṃsī,%} either as
a single expression or as two separate
terms) used to win these Dakṣiṇās were
notoriously false. See Kāṭhaka Saṃ-
hitā, xiv. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3,
2, 6. 7; Nirukta, i. 7; xi. 2.</F>
<F>3) The transition of meaning is similar
in the use of the English word ‘fee’;
‘cattle,’ ‘money,’ ‘payment for service’
(see Murray's English Dictionary,
{%s.v.%} ‘fee’). {%Cf.%} also {@Go-dāna,@} n. 4.</F>
<F>4) {%Cf.%} the rule that when nothing is
specified a cow is the Dakṣiṇā, Kāty-
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 2, 13; Lāṭy-
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 1, 2.</F>
<F>5) So, {%e.g.,%} Rv. i. 126, 1-4; v. 30,

10, 49 {%et seq.%} Clothes ({%vāsas%}) and gold
are mentioned as a Dakṣiṇā in Av. ix. 5,
14. The four Dakṣiṇās, according to
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 7,
are gold, a cow, clothes, and a horse.
This is practically exhaustive if the
trappings of the horse and ornaments
are included.</F>

xiii. 6, 2, 18, where the Brahmin's land
is excluded; and see xiii. 7, 1, 15, where
the gift of land is disapproved.</F>
