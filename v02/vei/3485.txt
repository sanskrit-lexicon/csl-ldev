{@Sabhā-sad,@}¦ ‘sitter in the assembly,’ is probably a technical
description of the assessors who decided legal cases in the
assembly ({%cf.%} {@Sabhācara@}). The term, which is found in the
Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> cannot well merely denote any member
of the assembly. It is also possible that the Sabhāsads, perhaps
the heads of families, were expected to be present at the Sabhā
oftener than the ordinary man: the meetings of the assembly
for justice may have been more frequent than for general discus-
sion and decision.
