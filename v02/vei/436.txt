{@Ṛṣis.@}¦ — The term ‘Seven Ṛṣis’ denotes the ‘Great Bear’ (see
1. {@Ṛkṣa@}) in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and occasionally
[Page1-118+ 53]

<F>2) Av vi. 40, 1 (where, however,
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva-
veda, 310. merely renders it as ‘seven
seers,’ and appears not to take it in a
technical sense); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
ii. 1, 2, 4; xiii. 8, 1, 9; Nirukta, x. 26,
etc.
