{@Pratī-darśa Śvaikna@}¦ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa<sup>1</sup> as sacrificing with the Dākṣāyaṇa offering, and as
teaching {@Suplan Sārñjaya,@} who thence became {@Sahadeva@}
{@Sārñjaya.@} In a second passage<sup>2</sup> he is called Pratīdarśa
Aibhāvata, and again brought into connexion with Suplan
Sārñjaya. According to Eggeling,<sup>3</sup> he is to be deemed a king
of the Śviknas; apparently, too, he was a descendant of
Ibhāvant. A Pratīdarśa is also mentioned in the Jaiminīya
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup>
