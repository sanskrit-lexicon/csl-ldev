{@Dhanus,@}¦ the ‘bow,’ frequently mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later,<sup>2</sup> was the chief weapon of the Vedic Indian.<sup>3</sup> The
last act of the funeral rite included the removal of the bow from
[Page1-389+ 53]
the right hand of the dead man.<sup>4</sup> The weapon was composed
of a stout staff bent into a curved shape ({%vakra%}),<sup>5</sup> and of a bow-
string ({@Jyā@}) made of a strip of cowhide<sup>6</sup> which joined the ends.
The tips of the bow, when the string was fastened, were called
{@Ārtnī.@} Relaxed when not in actual use, the bow was specially
strung up when needed for shooting.<sup>7</sup> The stages of the
process are given in detail in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā:<sup>8</sup> the
stringing ({%ā-tan%}) of the bow, the placing ({%prati-dhā%}) of the
arrow, the bending ({%ā-yam%}) of the bow, and the shooting ({%as%}).
The arrow was discharged from the ear,<sup>9</sup> and is hence called
{%karṇa-yoni,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘having the ear as its point of origin.’<sup>10</sup> The
making of bows was a regular profession ({%dhanuṣ-kāra,%}<sup>11</sup>
{%dhanuṣ-kṛt%}).<sup>12</sup> For the arrow see {@Iṣu,@} and for the handguard
{@Hastaghna.@}
