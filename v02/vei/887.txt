{@Gṛha@}¦ is used in the singular,<sup>1</sup> or oftener in the plural,<sup>2</sup> to
<div n="lb"/>denote the ‘house’ of the Vedic Indian. {@Dama@} or {@Dam@} has
[Page1-230+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>the same sense, while {@Pastyā@} and {@Harmya@} denote more
<div n="lb"/>especially the home with its surroundings, the family settle-
<div n="lb"/>ment. The house held not only the family, which might be of
<div n="lb"/>considerable size, but also the cattle<sup>3</sup> and the sheep<sup>4</sup> at night.
<div n="lb"/>It was composed of several rooms, as the use of the plural
<div n="lb"/>indicates, and it could be securely shut up.<sup>5</sup> The door ({@Dvār,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Dvāra@}) is often referred to, and from it the house is called
<div n="lb"/>{@Duroṇa.@} In every house the fire was kept burning.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is known of the structure of the house. Presum-
<div n="lb"/>ably stone was not used,<sup>7</sup> and houses were, as in Megasthenes'
<div n="lb"/>time,<sup>8</sup> built of wood. The hymns of the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> give
<div n="lb"/>some information about the construction of a house, but the
<div n="lb"/>details are extremely obscure, for most of the expressions used
<div n="lb"/>do not recur in any context in which their sense is clear.
<div n="lb"/>According to Zimmer,<sup>10</sup> four pillars ({@Upamit@}) were set up on a
<div n="lb"/>good site, and against them beams were leant at an angle as
<div n="lb"/>props ({@Pratimit@}). The upright pillars were connected by cross
<div n="lb"/>beams ({@Parimit@}) resting upon them. The roof was formed of
<div n="lb"/>ribs of bamboo cane ({%vaṃśa%}),<sup>11</sup> a ridge called {@Viṣūvant,@} and a
<div n="lb"/>net ({@Akṣu@}), which may mean a thatched covering<sup>12</sup> over the
<div n="lb"/>bamboo ribs. The walls were filled up with grass in bundles
<div n="lb"/>({%palada%}), and the whole structure was held together with ties of
[Page1-231+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>various sorts ({%nahana, prāṇāha, saṃdaṃśa, pariṣvañjalya%}).<sup>13</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>connexion with the house, mention is made of four terms which,
<div n="lb"/>though primarily sacrificial in meaning, seem to designate parts
<div n="lb"/>of the building: Havirdhāna, ‘oblation-holder’; Agniśāla,<sup>14</sup> ‘fire-
<div n="lb"/>place’; Patnīnāṃ Sadana, ‘wives’ room’; and Sadas, ‘sitting
<div n="lb"/>room.’ Slings or hanging vessels ({@Śikya@}) are also mentioned.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Reedwork ({%iṭa%}) is spoken of, no doubt as part of the finishing
<div n="lb"/>of the walls of the house.<sup>16</sup> The sides are called {@Pakṣa.@} The
<div n="lb"/>door with its framework was named {@Ātā.@}

<div n="lb"/>were of bamboo and were probably
<div n="lb"/>fixed in the ridge, the roof was wagon
<div n="lb"/>headed, like the huts of the Todas at the
