{@Gṛha@}¦ is used in the singular,<sup>1</sup> or oftener in the plural,<sup>2</sup> to
denote the ‘house’ of the Vedic Indian. {@Dama@} or {@Dam@} has
[Page1-230+ 62]
the same sense, while {@Pastyā@} and {@Harmya@} denote more
especially the home with its surroundings, the family settle-
ment. The house held not only the family, which might be of
considerable size, but also the cattle<sup>3</sup> and the sheep<sup>4</sup> at night.
It was composed of several rooms, as the use of the plural
indicates, and it could be securely shut up.<sup>5</sup> The door ({@Dvār,@}
{@Dvāra@}) is often referred to, and from it the house is called
{@Duroṇa.@} In every house the fire was kept burning.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is known of the structure of the house. Presum-
ably stone was not used,<sup>7</sup> and houses were, as in Megasthenes'
time,<sup>8</sup> built of wood. The hymns of the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> give
some information about the construction of a house, but the
details are extremely obscure, for most of the expressions used
do not recur in any context in which their sense is clear.
According to Zimmer,<sup>10</sup> four pillars ({@Upamit@}) were set up on a
good site, and against them beams were leant at an angle as
props ({@Pratimit@}). The upright pillars were connected by cross
beams ({@Parimit@}) resting upon them. The roof was formed of
ribs of bamboo cane ({%vaṃśa%}),<sup>11</sup> a ridge called {@Viṣūvant,@} and a
net ({@Akṣu@}), which may mean a thatched covering<sup>12</sup> over the
bamboo ribs. The walls were filled up with grass in bundles
({%palada%}), and the whole structure was held together with ties of
[Page1-231+ 53]
various sorts ({%nahana, prāṇāha, saṃdaṃśa, pariṣvañjalya%}).<sup>13</sup> In
connexion with the house, mention is made of four terms which,
though primarily sacrificial in meaning, seem to designate parts
of the building: Havirdhāna, ‘oblation-holder’; Agniśāla,<sup>14</sup> ‘fire-
place’; Patnīnāṃ Sadana, ‘wives’ room’; and Sadas, ‘sitting
room.’ Slings or hanging vessels ({@Śikya@}) are also mentioned.<sup>15</sup>
Reedwork ({%iṭa%}) is spoken of, no doubt as part of the finishing
of the walls of the house.<sup>16</sup> The sides are called {@Pakṣa.@} The
door with its framework was named {@Ātā.@}

<F>11) It seems likely that, as the ribs
were of bamboo and were probably
fixed in the ridge, the roof was wagon
headed, like the huts of the Todas at the
present day (see illustrations in Rivers,
{%The Todas,%} pp. 25, 27, 28, 51), and the
rock-cut Chaityas, or Assembly Halls, of
the Buddhists in Western India, in some
of the earliest of which the wooden
ribs of the arched roof are still pre-
served. See Fergusson, {%History of%}

the Agniśāla with the central room,

the Patnīnāṃ Sadana with the women's
