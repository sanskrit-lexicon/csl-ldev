{@Kṣatriya.@}¦ — As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes,
<div n="lb"/>intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be
<div n="lb"/>discussed under {@Varṇa,@} this article will be confined to deter-
<div n="lb"/>mining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas, or collectively {@Kṣatra.@}
<div n="P"/>The evidence of the Jātakas<sup>1</sup> points to the word Khattiya
[Page1-203+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>denoting the members of the old Āryan nobility who had led
<div n="lb"/>the tribes to conquest, {@as well@} as those families of the aborigines
<div n="lb"/>who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite
<div n="lb"/>of the conquest. In the epic<sup>2</sup> also the term Kṣatriya seems to
<div n="lb"/>include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification
<div n="lb"/>than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals
<div n="lb"/>and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same
<div n="lb"/>as the {%barones%} of early English history. Neither in the
<div n="lb"/>Jātakas<sup>3</sup> nor in the epic<sup>4</sup> is the term co-extensive with all
<div n="lb"/>warriors; the army contains many besides the Kṣatriyas, who
<div n="lb"/>are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file.
<div n="P"/>In the later Saṃhitās<sup>5</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>6</sup> the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from
<div n="lb"/>the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, {@Brāhmaṇa,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vaiśya,@} and {@Śūdra.@} It is significant that Rājanya is a variant
<div n="lb"/>to Kṣatriya, and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to
<div n="lb"/>suppose that the Kṣatriya and Rājanya are both of similar
<div n="lb"/>origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>the early use of Kṣatriya in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> is exclusively con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with royal authority or divine authority.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be in-
<div n="lb"/>cluded in the term Kṣatriya. That it covered the royal house
<div n="lb"/>and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their
<div n="lb"/>families: this would explain the occasional opposition of
<div n="lb"/>Rājanya and Kṣatriya, as in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>8</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>a Rājanya asks a Kṣatriya for a place for sacrifice ({%deva-yajana%}).
<div n="lb"/>Thus, when strictly applied, Kṣatriya would have a wider
<div n="lb"/>denotation than Rājanya. As a rule, however, the two
<div n="lb"/>expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in
<div n="lb"/>what follows. That Kṣatriya ever included the mere fighting
[Page1-204+ 72]
<div n="lb"/>man has not been proved: in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> and later<sup>10</sup> others
<div n="lb"/>than Kṣatriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had
<div n="lb"/>retinues as the kings had, Kṣatriya would embrace those
<div n="lb"/>retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply
<div n="lb"/>to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the
<div n="lb"/>{@Grāmaṇī@} was usually a Vaiśya.
<div n="P"/>The connexion of the Kṣatriyas with the Brahmins was very
<div n="lb"/>close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted<sup>11</sup> to
<div n="lb"/>be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king
<div n="lb"/>({@Rājan@}) and domestic priest ({@Purohita@}). Sometimes there was
<div n="lb"/>feud between Kṣatriya and Brahmin.<sup>12</sup> His management of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the Kṣatriya by
<div n="lb"/>embroiling him with the people<sup>13</sup> or with other Kṣatriyas.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the common people, on the other hand, the Kṣa-
<div n="lb"/>triya stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There are, however, references to occasional feuds between
[Page1-205+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>the people and the nobles,<sup>16</sup> in which no doubt the inferior
<div n="lb"/>numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms
<div n="lb"/>and prowess. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the Vaiśya is
<div n="lb"/>described as tributary to another ({%anyasya bali-kṛt%}), to be
<div n="lb"/>devoured by another ({%anyasyādya%}), and to be oppressed at will
<div n="lb"/>({%yathākāma-jyeya%}). Probably these epithets apply most strictly
<div n="lb"/>to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage
<div n="lb"/>shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles.
<div n="lb"/>No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have
<div n="lb"/>been hereditary, to be supported by the common people,
<div n="lb"/>whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these
<div n="lb"/>privileges the Kṣatriyas had probably duties of protection to
<div n="lb"/>perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an
<div n="lb"/>obscure passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The main duty of the Kṣatriya in the small states<sup>19</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his
<div n="lb"/>special attribute,<sup>20</sup> just as the goad is that of the agriculturist;
<div n="lb"/>for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is
<div n="lb"/>uncertain. In the latest stratum of the Brāhmaṇa literature
<div n="lb"/>there are references to learned princes like {@Janaka@} of {@Videha,@}
<div n="lb"/>who is said to have become a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}), apparently in
<div n="lb"/>the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>possessed.<sup>21</sup> Other learned Kṣatriyas of this period were
[Page1-206+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>22</sup> {@Aśvapati Kaikeya,@}<sup>23</sup> and Ajātaśatru.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Garbe,<sup>25</sup> Grierson,<sup>26</sup> and others believe they are justified in
<div n="lb"/>holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special
<div n="lb"/>philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which
<div n="lb"/>appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there
<div n="lb"/>is clear evidence<sup>27</sup> that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics
<div n="lb"/>were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to
<div n="lb"/>attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece
<div n="lb"/>of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages ({%rājan-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%yarṣi%}),<sup>28</sup> but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on
<div n="lb"/>them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sāyaṇa.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Again, the Nirukta<sup>30</sup> gives a tradition relating how {@Devāpi,@}
<div n="lb"/>a king's son, became the Purohita of his younger brother
<div n="lb"/>{@Śaṃtanu;@} but it is very doubtful if the story can really be
<div n="lb"/>traced with Sieg<sup>31</sup> in the Rigveda<sup>32</sup> itself. In any case, the
<div n="lb"/>stories refer only to a few selected Kṣatriyas of high rank,
<div n="lb"/>while there is no evidence that the average Kṣatriya was
<div n="lb"/>concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any
<div n="lb"/>reference to Kṣatriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade
<div n="lb"/>or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of
<div n="lb"/>administration and war were adequate to absorb his atten-
<div n="lb"/>tion. On the other hand, we do hear of a Rājanya
[Page1-207+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>as a lute player and singer at the Aśvamedha or horse
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the training and education of a Kṣatriya we have no
<div n="lb"/>record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was
<div n="lb"/>mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and
<div n="lb"/>the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve
<div n="lb"/>on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility
<div n="lb"/>which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably
<div n="lb"/>not unusual or impossible for a Vaiśya to become a Kṣatriya;
<div n="lb"/>at least, this assumption best explains the phrase<sup>34</sup> ‘claiming
<div n="lb"/>falsely a Kṣatriya's rank’ ({%kṣatriyaṃ mithuyā dhārayantam%}).
<div n="P"/>The king and the Kṣatriyas must have stood in a particularly
<div n="lb"/>close relation. The former being the Kṣatriya {%par excellence,%}
<div n="lb"/>it is to him rather than to the ordinary Kṣatriya that we must
<div n="lb"/>refer passages like that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>35</sup> where it
<div n="lb"/>is said that the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the clansmen,
<div n="lb"/>gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found
<div n="lb"/>among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of
<div n="lb"/>the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>36</sup> it is said that a Kṣatriya consecrates a Kṣatriya, a
<div n="lb"/>clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of
<div n="lb"/>the old king consecrating the prince ({%kumāra%}) who is to succeed
<div n="lb"/>him; and again,<sup>37</sup> the Kṣatriya and the Purohita are regarded
<div n="lb"/>as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel
<div n="lb"/>with the Purohita here suggesting that the Kṣatriya {%par excellence%}
<div n="lb"/>is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes con-
<div n="lb"/>trasted with the Rājanya.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sūtra literature contains elaborate rules<sup>39</sup> for the educa-
[Page1-208+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>tion and occupations of Kṣatriyas, but their contents cannot
<div n="lb"/>always be traced in the Brāhmaṇa literature, and their value is
<div n="lb"/>questionable.
