{@Upa-jihvikā, Upa-jīkā, Upa-dīkā@}¦ are all forms of one word
denoting a species of ant.<sup>1</sup> To these ants is attributed in the
Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> the power of penetrating to water which possesses
curative properties. They were accordingly used in all sorts of
spells against poisoning. The belief in their healing qualities
was no doubt due to the well-known properties of the earth of
ant-heaps which contains their water.
