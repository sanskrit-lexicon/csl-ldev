{@Praṣṭi,@}¦ like {@Pṛṣṭyā,@} denotes a ‘side horse,’ which, however,
<div n="lb"/>possibly<sup>1</sup> did not necessarily mean a horse running beside the
<div n="lb"/>yoke-horses, but may also have meant a third horse yoked in
<div n="lb"/>front as a leader. This seems to be indicated by the reference
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> to the Praṣṭi — here applied to the Maruts’
<div n="lb"/>team — leading ({%vahati%}) the team ({%rohitaḥ%}). In an obscure
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> there is a reference to the Praṣṭis
<div n="lb"/>in connexion with a {%pañca-vāhī,%} ‘drawn by five,’ but it is
<div n="lb"/>impossible to gain any clear idea of what is meant. The
<div n="lb"/>Praṣṭi is not rarely referred to elsewhere.<sup>4</sup> In one passage<sup>5</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>{%dhuryau%} and the {%praṣṭyau%} are mentioned together; this probably
<div n="lb"/>means the two horses yoked to the pole, with two others
<div n="lb"/>fastened in some way one on each side. The adjectives {%praṣṭi-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%mant,%}<sup>6</sup> {%praṣṭi-vāhana,%}<sup>7</sup> {%praṣṭi-vāhin,%}<sup>8</sup> are all used of {@Ratha,@} ‘chariot,’
<div n="lb"/>meaning ‘drawn by a side horse (or horses)’ in addition to the
<div n="lb"/>yoke-horses. {%Cf.%} {@Ratha.@}
