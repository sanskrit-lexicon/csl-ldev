{@Mahā-vṛṣa@}¦ is the name of a tribe mentioned along with the
{@Mūjavants@} in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as a locality to which fever is
to be relegated. It is reasonable to suppose that they were
[Page2-143+ 46]
northerners, though Bloomfield<sup>2</sup> suggests that the name may
be chosen more for its sound and sense (as ‘of mighty strength’
to resist the disease) than for its geographical position. In the
Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> the place {@Raikvaparṇa@} is said to be in
the Mahāvṛṣa country. The king of the Mahāvṛṣas in the
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> is said to be {@Hṛtsvāśaya.@}
The Mahāvṛṣas are also known from a Mantra in the
Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.<sup>5</sup>
