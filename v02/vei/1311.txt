{@Didhiṣū-pati@}¦ occurs in the Kāṭhaka<sup>1</sup> and Kapiṣṭhala Saṃ-
<div n="lb"/>hitās,<sup>2</sup> as well as in the Āpastamba,<sup>3</sup> Gautama,<sup>4</sup> and Vasiṣṭha
[Page1-360+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>Dharma Sūtras,<sup>5</sup> in lists of people who have committed sin
<div n="lb"/>({%enas%}). The traditional rendering<sup>6</sup> is ‘husband of a woman
<div n="lb"/>married a second time’; Manu<sup>7</sup> seems to apply the term to the
<div n="lb"/>brother-in-law who is ‘married’ to his sister-in-law after his
<div n="lb"/>brother's death for the purpose of begetting a child, if he
<div n="lb"/>displays conjugal affection to her ({%anurajyate kāmataḥ%}).<sup>8</sup> This
<div n="lb"/>sense would be possible, since {@Didhiṣu@} denotes a ‘wooer,’ and
<div n="lb"/>a widow could be regarded as a ‘wooer’ when able to control
<div n="lb"/>her own choice of a spouse. But another tradition<sup>9</sup> holds that
<div n="lb"/>Didhiṣū means the elder sister whose younger sister has
<div n="lb"/>married before her. This view is supported by a passage in the
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,<sup>10</sup> and by the use of the word {%agre-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%didhiṣū-pati,%}<sup>11</sup> which must mean the ‘husband of a younger
<div n="lb"/>sister married before the elder.’ In this case also Didhiṣū
<div n="lb"/>would mean ‘wooer,’ the elder sister being so called because,
<div n="lb"/>if her parents do not arrange a marriage for her, she is,
<div n="lb"/>according to Viṣṇu,<sup>12</sup> to make her own choice of a husband
<div n="lb"/>({%kuryāt svayaṃvaram%}). See also {@Edidhiṣuḥpati@} and {@Daidhi-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ṣavya.@}
