{@Brahma-purohita@}¦ is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> where the St. Petersburg Dictionary
<div n="lb"/>gives the sense as ‘having the priesthood as its Purohita.’
<div n="lb"/>This seems rather doubtful; more probably the sense should be
<div n="lb"/>‘having a Brahman priest as Purohita,’ unless the word merely
<div n="lb"/>means ‘having the priesthood superior to it,’ as an epithet of
<div n="lb"/>{@Kṣatra,@} the ‘warrior caste,’ which seems to be Weber's view.<sup>3</sup>
