{@Vāsas@}¦ is the most usual word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for
‘clothing.’ Clothes were often woven of sheep's wool ({%cf.%}
{@Ūrṇā@}); the god Pūṣan is called a ‘weaver of garments’ ({%vāse-%}
{%vāya%})<sup>3</sup> because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms.
The garments worn were often embroidered ({%cf.%} {@Peśas@}), and
the Maruts are described as wearing mantles adorned with
gold.<sup>4</sup> When the ‘giver of garments’ ({%vāso-dā%})<sup>5</sup> is mentioned
along with the giver of horses and gold, ornamental garments are
probably meant. There are several references in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
to the Indians' love of ornament, which is attested by Megas-
[Page2-292+ 53]
thenes for his day.<sup>7</sup> The Rigveda also presents epithets like
{%su-vasana%}<sup>8</sup> and {%su-rabhi,%}<sup>9</sup> implying that garments were becoming
or well-fitting.
<div n="P"/>The Vedic Indian seems often to have worn three garments
-an undergarment ({%cf.%} {@Nīvi@}),<sup>10</sup> a garment,<sup>11</sup> and an over-
garment ({%cf.%} {@Adhīvāsa@}),<sup>12</sup> which was presumably a mantle, and
for which the names {@Atka@} and {@Drāpi@} also seem to be used.
This accords with the description of the sacrificial garments
given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> which comprise a {@Tārpya,@}
perhaps a ‘silken undergarment’; secondly, a garment of
undyed wool, and then a mantle, while the ends of the turban,
after being tied behind the neck, are brought forward and
tucked away in front. The last point would hardly accord
with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a
special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the
case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda<sup>14</sup>
and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup> There is nothing to show
exactly what differences there were between male and female
costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in
either case.
<div n="P"/>It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently
assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis
would wear clothing of some sort.<sup>16</sup>

A garment of Kuśa grass is mentioned
in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 1, 8, as
worn by the wife of the sacrificer at
the consecration, but it is doubtful
whether such dresses were normally
worn. {%Cf.%} also {%kausumbha-paridhāna,%}
