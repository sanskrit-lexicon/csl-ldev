{@Nir-āla@}¦ occurs once in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> where Sāyaṇa
regards it as the name of a disease. Bloomfield,<sup>2</sup> with the
Padapāṭha, explains it as two words, understanding {%nir%} as an
elliptical imperative, ‘(go) out,’ with the vocative {%āla,%} a kind
of weed. Whitney<sup>3</sup> at first took {%āla%} to be a verbal form, but
finally came to the conclusion that the expression is one word,
{%nirāla,%} of unknown sense.
