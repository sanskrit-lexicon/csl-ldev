{@Sūri@}¦ is the regular word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> for the sacrificer, the
later Yajamāna — that is, the man who pays the priests for
performing the rite, and reaps the benefit of that service. The
Sūris are often coupled with the {@Maghavans,@}<sup>1</sup> described as
heroes or warriors,<sup>2</sup> and as related to the priests by their
patronage<sup>3</sup> or as companions.<sup>4</sup>
