{@Ā-sandī.@}¦ — This is a generic term for a seat of some sort,
<div n="lb"/>occurring frequently in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>but not in the Rigveda. In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> the settle brought
<div n="lb"/>for the {@Vrātya@} is described at length. It had two feet, lengths
<div n="lb"/>wise and cross-pieces, forward and cross-cords, showing that it
<div n="lb"/>was made of wood and also cording. It was also covered with
<div n="lb"/>a cushion ({@Āstaraṇa@}) and a pillow ({@Upabarhaṇa@}), had a seat
<div n="lb"/>({@Āsāda@}) and a support ({@Upaśraya@}). Similar seats are described
<div n="lb"/>in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>4</sup> and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The seat for the king at the royal consecration is described in
<div n="lb"/>very similar terms in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> where the
<div n="lb"/>height of the feet is placed at a span, and the lengthwise and
<div n="lb"/>cross-pieces are each to be a cubit, while the interwoven part
<div n="lb"/>({%vivayana%}) is to be of Muñja grass, and the seat of Udumbara
<div n="lb"/>wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> Lanman
<div n="lb"/>seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There
<div n="lb"/>also a cushion ({@Upadhāna@}) and coverlet ({@Upavāsana@}) are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa repeatedly describes
<div n="lb"/>the Āsandī in terms showing that it was an elaborate seat. In
<div n="lb"/>one place<sup>8</sup> it is said to be made of Khadira wood, perforated
<div n="lb"/>({%vi-tṛṇṇā%}), and joined with straps ({%vardhra-yutā%}) like that of the
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratas. At the Sautrāmaṇī rite<sup>9</sup> (an Indra sacrifice) the
<div n="lb"/>seat is of Udumbara wood, is knee-high, and of unlimited
<div n="lb"/>width and depth, and is covered with plaited reed-work. The
[Page1-072+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>imperial seat<sup>10</sup> is to be shoulder-high, of Udumbara wood, and
<div n="lb"/>wound all over with cords of Balvaja grass ({%Eleusina indica%}).
<div n="lb"/>Elsewhere<sup>11</sup> the seat is a span high, a cubit in width and
<div n="lb"/>depth, of Udumbara wood, and covered with reed-grass cords,
<div n="lb"/>and daubed with clay.
