{@Bharad-vāja@}¦ is the name of the reputed<sup>1</sup> author of the sixth
Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. The attribution is so far correct that
Bharadvāja<sup>2</sup> and the Bharadvājas<sup>3</sup> are repeatedly mentioned as
singers in that Maṇḍala. Judging by the tone of the references
to Bharadvāja, he can hardly be deemed to have been a con-
temporary of any of the hymns.<sup>4</sup> According to the Pañcaviṃśa
[Page2-098+ 52]
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> he was the Purohita of {@Divodāsa.@} This interpreta-
tion is to be preferred to that of Roth,<sup>6</sup> who suggests that he
and Divodāsa were identical. His connexion with the house of
Divodāsa also appears from the statement of the Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā<sup>7</sup> that Bharadvāja gave {@Pratardana@} the kingdom. It
is unnecessary to suppose that the same Bharadvāja was meant
in both cases, and that Pratardana was a son of Divodāsa: the
later Saṃhitās refer to Bharadvāja, like the other great sages,
irrespective of chronology.
<div n="P"/>The Bharadvājas in their poems mention {@Bṛbu, Bṛsaya,@} and
the {@Pārāvatas.@}<sup>8</sup> Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> has pointed out that they are also
connected with the {@Sṛñjayas.@} In particular, the Śāṅkhāyana
Śrauta Sūtra<sup>10</sup> mentions that Bharadvāja gained largesse from
{@Prastoka Sārñjaya@} and Bṛbu. But it is very doubtful if it is
correct to place all these people and Divodāsa in Arachosia
and Drangiana.
<div n="P"/>Bharadvāja as an author and a seer is frequently referred to
in the later Saṃhitās<sup>11</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>12</sup>
