{@Tantu@}¦ appears properly to mean ‘thread,’ and in particular
the ‘warp’ of a piece of weaving, as opposed to {@Otu,@} the ‘woof.’
Both senses are found in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> In the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> the ‘warp’ is called {%anuchāda,%} the ‘woof’ {%paryāsa,%}
the {%tantavaḥ%} being the ‘threads.’ In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>3</sup>
[Page1-299+ 38]
on the other hand, the ‘warp’ is {%prācīna-tāna,%} the ‘woof’ {%otu.%}
The threads or cords of the throne ({@Pary ṅka@}) are referred to
in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the word is used only metaphorically, and
this is its most frequent use even in the Brāhmanas.<sup>5</sup> See
also {@Vāṇa.@}
