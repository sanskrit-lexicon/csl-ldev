1. {@Rājan,@}¦ ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rig-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>1</sup> and the later literature.<sup>2</sup> It is quite clear that the
<div n="lb"/>normal, though not universal form of government, in early
<div n="lb"/>India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the
<div n="lb"/>fact that the Āryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory:
<div n="lb"/>a situation which, as in the case of the Āryan invaders of
<div n="lb"/>Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost
<div n="lb"/>necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the
<div n="lb"/>constitution.<sup>3</sup> The mere patriarchal organization of society
<div n="lb"/>is not sufficient, as Zimmer<sup>4</sup> assumes, to explain the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>kingship.
[Page2-211+ 53]
<div n="P"/>{%Tenure of Monarchy.%} — Zimmer<sup>5</sup> is of opinion that while the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown
<div n="lb"/>by several cases where the descent can be traced,<sup>6</sup> yet in others
<div n="lb"/>the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the
<div n="lb"/>selection by the people was between the members of the royal
<div n="lb"/>family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It
<div n="lb"/>must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective
<div n="lb"/>monarchy is not strong. As Geldner<sup>7</sup> argues, all the passages
<div n="lb"/>cited<sup>8</sup> can be regarded not as choice by the cantons ({@Viś@}), but
<div n="lb"/>as acceptance by the subjects ({%viś%}): this seems the more prob-
<div n="lb"/>able sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was
<div n="lb"/>not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member
<div n="lb"/>of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is
<div n="lb"/>exemplified by the legend in Yāska<sup>9</sup> of the Kuru brothers,
<div n="lb"/>{@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} the value of which, as evidence of
<div n="lb"/>contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend
<div n="lb"/>itself being of dubious character and validity.
<div n="P"/>Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references
<div n="lb"/>to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to
<div n="lb"/>recover their sovereignty,<sup>10</sup> and the Atharvaveda contains spells
<div n="lb"/>in the interest of royalty.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King in War.%} — Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rig-
<div n="lb"/>veda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no
<div n="lb"/>doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal
<div n="lb"/>functions. But the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> contains the state-
<div n="lb"/>ment that the {@Kuru-Pañcāla@} kings, who, like the Brahmins of
[Page2-212+ 71]
<div n="lb"/>those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to
<div n="lb"/>make their raids in the dewy season. The word {@Udāja,@} too,
<div n="lb"/>with its variant Nirāja, records that kings took a share of the
<div n="lb"/>booty of war. The Rigveda<sup>13</sup> has many references to Vedic
<div n="lb"/>wars: it is clear that the Kṣatriyas were at least as intent on
<div n="lb"/>fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and
<div n="lb"/>their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence
<div n="lb"/>was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector
<div n="lb"/>of the tribe’ ({%gopā janasya%}), or, as is said in the {@Rājasūya@}
<div n="lb"/>(‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’<sup>14</sup> His
<div n="lb"/>{@Purohita@} was expected to use his spells and charms to secure
<div n="lb"/>the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in
<div n="lb"/>person: so {@Pratardana@} met death in war according to the
<div n="lb"/>Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;<sup>15</sup> and in the Rājasūya the king is invoked
<div n="lb"/>as ‘sacker of cities’ ({%purāṃ bhettā%}).
<div n="P"/>{%The King in Peace.%} — In return for his warlike services the
<div n="lb"/>king received the obedience<sup>16</sup> — sometimes forced<sup>17</sup> — of the
<div n="lb"/>people, and in particular their contributions for the mainten-
<div n="lb"/>ance of royalty. The king is regularly<sup>18</sup> regarded as ‘devouring
[Page2-213+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that
<div n="lb"/>he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a
<div n="lb"/>custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the
<div n="lb"/>people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also
<div n="lb"/>probable that the king could assign the royal right of mainten-
<div n="lb"/>ance to a Kṣatriya, thus developing a nobility supported by the
<div n="lb"/>people. Taxation would not normally fall on Kṣatriya or
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin; the texts contain emphatic assertions of the exemp-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty.<sup>19</sup>In
<div n="lb"/>the people, however, lay the strength of the king.<sup>20</sup> See also
<div n="lb"/>{@Bali.@}
<div n="P"/>In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself
<div n="lb"/>immune from punishment ({%a-daṇḍya%}), he wields the rod of
<div n="lb"/>punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}).<sup>21</sup> It is probable that criminal justice
<div n="lb"/>remained largely in his actual administration, for the Sūtras<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal
<div n="lb"/>jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a
<div n="lb"/>royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a Rājanya is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as an overseer ({%adhyakṣa%}) of the punishment of a Śūdra in the
<div n="lb"/>Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>23</sup> In civil justice it may be that the king
<div n="lb"/>played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final
<div n="lb"/>appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The {@Madhyamaśī@}
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private
<div n="lb"/>judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, to some extent supported<sup>24</sup> by the frequent mention of
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa's spies, for Varuṇa is the divine counterpart of the
<div n="lb"/>human king.<sup>25</sup> Possibly such spies could be used in war
<div n="lb"/>also.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise
<div n="lb"/>of legislative activity by the king, though later it is an essential
[Page2-214+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>part of his duties.<sup>27</sup> Nor can we say exactly what executive
<div n="lb"/>functions devolved on the king.
<div n="P"/>In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his {@Puro-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@hita;@} he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal
<div n="lb"/>ministers and attendants (see {@Ratnin@}). The local administra-
<div n="lb"/>tion was entrusted to the {@Grāmaṇī,@} or village chief, who may
<div n="lb"/>have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs
<div n="lb"/>of the king's rank were his palace<sup>28</sup> and his brilliant dress.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King as Landowner.%} — The position of the king with
<div n="lb"/>regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices,<sup>30</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust,
<div n="lb"/>since they were collected by observers who were probably little
<div n="lb"/>used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose
<div n="lb"/>statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their
<div n="lb"/>statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare
<div n="lb"/>that only the king and no private person could own land, while
<div n="lb"/>in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins<sup>31</sup> is strongly
<div n="lb"/>of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection
<div n="lb"/>-{%i.e.,%} in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was
<div n="lb"/>recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual
<div n="lb"/>or the joint family also owned the land. As against Baden-
<div n="lb"/>Powell,<sup>32</sup> who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner
<div n="lb"/>was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we
<div n="lb"/>have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>33</sup> the {@Vaiśya@} can be
<div n="lb"/>devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the {@Śūdra,@} not
<div n="lb"/>killed); and for the period of the legal Sūtras and Śāstras he
<div n="lb"/>cites Bṛhaspati and Nārada as clearly recognizing the king's
<div n="lb"/>overlordship, besides a passage of the Mānava Dharma Śāstra<sup>34</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which
[Page2-215+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>Bühler<sup>35</sup> was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning.
<div n="lb"/>The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought.
<div n="lb"/>It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely con-
<div n="lb"/>ceived — as the English king still is — as lord of all the land in a
<div n="lb"/>proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea
<div n="lb"/>was only a gradual development than that it was primitive.
<div n="lb"/>The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a
<div n="lb"/>right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in
<div n="lb"/>South Africa,<sup>36</sup> where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of
<div n="lb"/>his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The
<div n="lb"/>matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the
<div n="lb"/>parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the
<div n="lb"/>political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way
<div n="lb"/>of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins<sup>37</sup> thinks
<div n="lb"/>that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first
<div n="lb"/>sign of land transactions in the Brāhmaṇas, was an actual gift
<div n="lb"/>of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily
<div n="lb"/>also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are
<div n="lb"/>hardly decisive one way or the other.
<div n="P"/>For the relations of the king with the assembly, see {@Sabhā;@}
<div n="lb"/>for his consecration, see {@Rājasūya.@} A-rāja-tā, ‘lack of a king,’
<div n="lb"/>means ‘anarchy.’<sup>38</sup>
