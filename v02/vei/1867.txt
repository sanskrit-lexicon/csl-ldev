{@Puru-kutsa@}¦ is the name of a king who is mentioned several
<div n="lb"/>times in the Rigveda. In one passage<sup>1</sup> he is mentioned as a
<div n="lb"/>contemporary of {@Sudās,@} but whether as a foe, according to
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> or merely as a contemporary, according to Hille-
<div n="lb"/>brandt,<sup>3</sup> is uncertain. In two other passages<sup>4</sup> he is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as victorious by divine favour, and in another<sup>5</sup> he appears as a
<div n="lb"/>king of the {@Pūrus@} and a conqueror of the {@Dāsas.@} His son was
<div n="lb"/>{@Trasadasyu,@}<sup>6</sup> who is accordingly called {@Paurukutsya@}<sup>7</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>{@Paurukutsi.@}<sup>8</sup> Different conclusions have been drawn from one
<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> in which the birth of Purukutsa's son,
[Page1-542+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that
<div n="lb"/>Purukutsa was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his
<div n="lb"/>wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But
<div n="lb"/>Sieg<sup>10</sup> offers a completely different interpretation. According
<div n="lb"/>to him the word {@daurgahe,@} which occurs in the hymn, and
<div n="lb"/>which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of Durgaha,’
<div n="lb"/>an ancestor of Purukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn
<div n="lb"/>recording the success of an Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
<div n="lb"/>undertaken by Purukutsa for his wife, as by kings in later
<div n="lb"/>times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the
<div n="lb"/>version of {%daurgahe%} given in the Śatapatha,<sup>11</sup> but is by no
<div n="lb"/>means certain. Moreover, if Purukutsa was a contemporary of
<div n="lb"/>Sudās, the defeat of the Pūrus by Sudās in the {@Dāśarājña@}<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>might well have been the cause of the troubles from which
<div n="lb"/>{@Purukutsānī,@} by the birth of Trasadasyu, rescued the family.
<div n="lb"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> Purukutsa is called an Aikṣvāka.
