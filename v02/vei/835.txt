{@Gaṅgā,@}¦ the modern Ganges, is mentioned directly in the
Rigveda only once, in the Nadī-stuti or ‘Praise of Rivers.’<sup>1</sup>
But it is also referred to in the derivative form {%gāṅgyaḥ%} as an
epithet of {@Urukakṣa.@}<sup>3</sup> The name of this river does not occur

[Page1-218+ 43]
in the other Saṃhitā, but appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup>
where victories of {@Bharata Dauḥṣanti@} on both Gaṅgā and
{@Yamunā@} are referred to, and in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>5</sup>
especial honour is assigned to those who dwell between the
Gaṅgā and the Yamunā, this being. To doubt, the region in
which that text originated. The identification of the Gaṅgā
with the Apayā<sup>6</sup> made by Ludwig<sup>7</sup> must be rejected: see
{@Āpayā.@}
