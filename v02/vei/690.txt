{@Kṛtvan.@}¦ — In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the word Kṛtvan in
<div n="lb"/>the plural is mentioned with the {@Ārjīkas@} and the five peoples.
<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>2</sup> thinks that it means a people, and Sāyaṇa expressly
<div n="lb"/>says that the Kṛtvans designate a country.<sup>3</sup> The name in that
<div n="lb"/>case would point to some connexion with the {@Kurus@} or {@Krivis.@}
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>4</sup> however, thinks that the word is an adjective
<div n="lb"/>which qualifies Ārjīkas and designates this people as magicians,
<div n="lb"/>being applied to them by an opponent. In favour of this view,
<div n="lb"/>he quotes Hiouen Thsang's statement<sup>5</sup> that the neighbouring
<div n="lb"/>kings held the base Kaśmīrians in such scorn as to refuse all
<div n="lb"/>alliance with them, and to give them the name of Ki-li-to, or
<div n="lb"/>Kṛtyas. He suggests that the Ārjīkas settled in Kasmīr in
<div n="lb"/>ancient times already had the same evil reputation as their
<div n="lb"/>successors in later days.
