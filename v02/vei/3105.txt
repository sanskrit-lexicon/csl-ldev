{@Vyāghra,@}¦ ‘tiger,’ is never found in the Rigveda, but
frequently occurs in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> as well as the lion
This fact is legitimately regarded as an indication that the
Atharvaveda belongs to a period when the Vedic Indian had
approached and entered the territory of Bengal. Later,<sup>2</sup> also,
mention of the tiger is quite common. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
preserves a reference to the danger of waking a sleeping tiger.
The destructive character of the animal is often alluded to,<sup>4</sup>
the man-eater ({%puruṣād%})<sup>5</sup> being also mentioned. Like the lion,
the tiger passes as a symbol of strength.<sup>6</sup> This idea is illus-
trated by the fact that the king at the {@Rājasūya@} (‘royal
consecration’) steps<sup>7</sup> on a tiger's skin to win himself the
strength of the animal. {%Cf.%} also {@Śārdūla, Petva.@}
