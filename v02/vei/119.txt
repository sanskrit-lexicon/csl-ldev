{@Ayas.@}¦ — The exact metal denoted by this word when used by
itself, as always in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is uncertain. As favouring the
sense of ‘bronze’ rather than that of ‘iron’ may perhaps be
cited with Zimmer<sup>2</sup> the fact that Agni is called {%ayo-daṃṣṭra,%}
‘with teeth of Ayas,’<sup>3</sup> with reference to the colour of his flames,
and that the car-seat of Mitra and Varuṇa is called {%ayaḥ-sthūṇa,%}<sup>4</sup>
‘with pillars of Ayas’ at the setting of the sun.<sup>5</sup> Moreover,
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>6</sup> Ayas is enumerated in a list of six
metals: gold ({%hiraṇya%}), Ayas, Śyāma, Loha, lead ({%sīsa%}), tin
({%trapu%}). Here {%śyāma%} (‘swarthy’) and {%loha%} (‘red’) must mean
‘iron’ and ‘copper’ respectively; {%ayas%} would therefore seem to
mean ‘bronze.’ In many passages in the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> and
[Page1-032+ 48]
other books, the Ayas is divided into two species — the {%śyāma%}
(‘iron’) and the {%lohita%} (‘copper’ or ‘bronze’). In the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> a distinction is drawn between Ayas and {%lohāyasa,%}
which may either be a distinction between iron and copper as
understood by Eggeling,<sup>9</sup> or between copper and bronze as held
by Schrader.<sup>10</sup> In one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>11</sup> the sense of
iron seems certain. Possibly, too, the arrow of the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup>
which had a tip of Ayas ({%yasyā ayo mukham%}), was pointed
with iron. Copper, however, is conceivable, and bronze quite
likely.
<div n="P"/>Iron is called {%śyāma ayas%} or {%śyāma%} alone.<sup>13</sup> See also
{@Kārṣṇāyasa.@} Copper is {@Lohāyasa@} or {@Lohitāyasa.@}
<div n="P"/>The smelting ({%dhmā%} ‘to blow’) of the metal is frequently
referred to. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> states that if ‘well
smelted’ ({%bahu-dhmātam%}) it is like gold, referring evidently to
bronze. A heater of Ayas is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā,<sup>15</sup> and bowls of Ayas are also spoken of.<sup>16</sup>
