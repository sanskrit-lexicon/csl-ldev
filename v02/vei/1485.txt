13. {@Svātī@}¦ or {@Niṣṭyā@} is later clearly the brilliant star Arcturus
or <lang n="greek">α</lang> Bootis, its place in the north being assured by the notice
in the Śāntikalpa,<sup>83</sup> where it is said to be ‘ever traversing the
northern way’ ({%nityam uttara-mārgagam%}). The Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>84</sup> however, constructs an asterismal Prajāpati,
giving him Citrā (<lang n="greek">α</lang> Virginis) for head, Hasta (Corvus) for
hand, the Viśākhe (<lang n="greek">α</lang> and <lang n="greek">β</lang> Libræ) for thighs, and the
Anurādhās (<lang n="greek">β, δ,</lang>, and <lang n="greek">π</lang> Scorpionis) for standing place, with
Niṣṭyā for heart. But Arcturus, being 30° out, spoils this
figure, while, on the other hand, the Arabic and Chinese
systems have respectively, instead of Arcturus, <lang n="greek">ι, κ</lang>, and <lang n="greek">λ</lang>
Virginis and <lang n="greek">κ</lang> Virginis, which would well fit into the Prajāpati
figure. But in spite of the force of this argument of Weber's,<sup>85</sup>
Whitney<sup>86</sup> is not certain that Niṣṭyā here must mean a star in
Virgo, pointing out that the name Niṣṭyā, ‘outcast,’ suggests
the separation of this Nakṣatra from the others in question.
