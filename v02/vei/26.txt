{@Aja, Ajā.@}¦ — This is the ordinary name for goat in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and the later literature. The goat is also called {@Basta, Chāga,@}
{@Chagala.@} Goats and sheep ({%ajāvayaḥ%}) are very frequently
mentioned together.<sup>2</sup> The female goat is spoken of as pro-
ducing two or three kids,<sup>3</sup> and goat's milk is well known.<sup>4</sup>
The goat as representative of Pūṣan plays an important part
in the ritual of burial.<sup>5</sup> The occupation of a goatherd ({%ajapāla%})
was a recognized one, being distinguished from that of a cow-
herd and of a shepherd.<sup>6</sup>
