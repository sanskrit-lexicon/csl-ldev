{@Kuruṅga@}¦ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a prince and a
<div n="lb"/>patron. Ludwig<sup>2</sup> suggests that he was a king of the {@Anus,@}
<div n="lb"/>but for this theory there seems no good ground. As the
<div n="lb"/>{@Turvaśas@} are mentioned in the same verse, he may possibly
<div n="lb"/>have been one of their kings. The name suggests a connexion
<div n="lb"/>with the {@Kurus,@} and it may be noted that in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the Turvaśas are connected with the {@Pañcālas@}
<div n="lb"/>{@(Krivis).@}
