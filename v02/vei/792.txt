{@Kṣattṛ@}¦ is a word of frequent occurrence in the later Saṃhitās
and Brāhmaṇas, denoting a member of the royal entourage,
but the sense is somewhat uncertain. In the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> it is
used of a god as the ‘distributor’ of good things to his
worshippers; the same sense seems to be found in the Athar-
vaveda<sup>2</sup> and elsewhere.<sup>3</sup> In one passage of the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> the interpretation ‘doorkeeper’ is given by the com-
mentator Mahīdhara, a sense which seems possible in other
passages,<sup>5</sup> while Sāyaṇa ascribes to it in one passage of the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> the more dignified meaning of {%antaḥ-%}
{%purādhyakṣa,%} ‘a chamberlain.’ In other passages,<sup>7</sup> again, the
sense of ‘charioteer’ is not unlikely. Later the Kṣattṛ was
regarded as a man of mixed caste.<sup>8</sup>
