{@Vitta@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes ‘wealth,’ ‘posses-
sions.’ The earth is referred to in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> as
full of riches ({%vittasya pūrṇā%}). The doctrine that a man's
greatness depends on his wealth is found as early as the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup> The striving after wealth ({%vittaiṣaṇā%}) is
mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>5</sup> as one of the
things abandoned by the sage.
