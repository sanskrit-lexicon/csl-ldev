{@Ārya@}¦ is the normal designation in the Vedic literature from
the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards of an Āryan, a member of the three
upper classes, {@Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya,@} or {@Vaiśya,@} as the formal
division is given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> The Ārya
stands in opposition to the {@Dāsa,@}<sup>3</sup> but also to the {@Śūdra.@}
Sometimes<sup>4</sup> the expression is restricted to the Vaiśya caste,
[Page1-065+ 56]
the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya receiving special designations;
but this use is not common, and it is often uncertain also
whether {@Arya@} is not meant. The phrase Śūdrāryau<sup>5</sup> is espe-
cially ambiguous, but appears to have denoted originally the
Śūdra and the Āryan, for in the Mahāvrata ceremony the fight
between a Śūdra and an Ārya is represented in the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa as one between a Brāhmaṇa and a Śūdra, though
the Sūtra treats it as a fight between a Vaiśya and a Śūdra.
<div n="P"/>The word Ārya (fem. Āryā or Ārī) also occurs frequently
used as an adjective to describe the Āryan classes ({%viśaḥ%}),<sup>6</sup> or
name ({%nāman%}),<sup>7</sup> or caste ({%varṇa%}),<sup>8</sup> or dwellings ({%dhāman%});<sup>9</sup> or
again reference is made to the Āryan supremacy ({%vrata%})<sup>10</sup> being
extended over the land. Āryan foes ({%vṛtra%})<sup>11</sup> are referred to
beside Dāsa foes, and there are many<sup>12</sup> references to war
of Āryan versus Āryan, as well as to war of Āryan against
Dāsa. From this it can be fairly deduced that even by the
time of the Rigveda the Āryan communities had advanced
far beyond the stage of simple conquest of the aborigines. In
the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas the wars alluded to seem
mainly Āryan wars, no doubt in consequence of the fusion of
Ārya and Dāsa into one community.
<div n="P"/>Weber<sup>13</sup> considers that the five peoples known to the Rigveda
were the Āryans and the four peoples of the quarters ({%diś%})
of the earth, but this is doubtful. Āryan speech ({%vāc%})<sup>14</sup>
is specially referred to in the Aitareya and Śāṅkhāyana
Āraṇyakas.

<F>4) Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 205, 215,
finds this use — understanding Ārya as
meant — in Atharvaveda, xix. 32, 8, and
62, 1, as well as in passages where
Śūdrāryau is found. Lanman, in
Whitney's Translation of the Athar-
vaveda, 948, 1003, quotes his view with
approval; but Whitney's version leaves
no doubt that he read and understood
the text as Ārya, the Āryan, not the
Vaiśya. For Whitney's view, Av. iv. 20,
4. 8 may be cited; and so Roth, St.
Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.,%} takes the
passages. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3,
10, 8, Śūdrāryau must mean Sūdra and
Vaiśya; but the Padapāṭha takes it as
Arya, and so does Zimmer.</F>
