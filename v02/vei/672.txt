1. {@Kuṣṭha@}¦ is the name of a plant ({%Costus speciosus%} or {%arabicus%})<sup>1</sup>
which is prominent in the Atharvaveda.<sup>2</sup> It grew especially on
the mountains, along with the Soma, on the high peaks of the
Himālaya ({%Himavant%}) where the eagles nest, and was thence
brought east to men.<sup>3</sup> Like Soma, it is said to have grown in
the third heaven under the famous {@Aśvattha@} tree, where the
gods were wont to assemble, and thence it was brought in a
golden ship.<sup>4</sup> As a remedy, it held the highest place among
herbs, being called by the auspicious names Nagha-māra and
Naghā-riṣa, and styled the offspring of Jīvala and Jīvalā, the
‘lively’ ones.<sup>5</sup> It cured headache ({%śīrṣāmaya%}), diseases of the
eyes, bodily affliction,<sup>6</sup> but especially fever — hence called ‘fever-
destroyer’ ({%takma-nāśana%}) — and consumption ({@Yakṣma@}). From
its general properties it was also named ‘all-healing’ ({%viśva-%}
{%bheṣaja%}).<sup>7</sup> Its aromatic qualities were apparently known, as it
is classed with ‘salve’ ({@Āñjana@}) and ‘nard’ ({@Nalada@}).<sup>8</sup>
