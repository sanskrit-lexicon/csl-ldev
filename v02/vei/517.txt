{@Kapota@}¦ is the name of a bird, probably the ‘pigeon’ (its
sense in the later language), occurring from the Rigveda
onwards.<sup>1</sup> It is associated in some passages<sup>2</sup> with the owl
({@Ulūka@}) as a messenger of Nirṛti (‘dissolution,’ ‘misfortune’).
This aspect of the pigeon as a bird of evil omen is probably
based on an ancient belief which is also found beyond the
confines of India.<sup>3</sup>
