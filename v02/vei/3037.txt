<div n="lb"/>where Indra is called {@Menā,@} perhaps his ‘wife’ or ‘daughter.’
<div n="lb"/>The same legend is alluded to in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,<sup>5</sup> but it is clear that all of these texts had
<div n="lb"/>no real tradition of what was referred to.
