{@Gabhasti@}¦ denotes, according to Roth,<sup>1</sup> the pole of a chariot
in the epithet {%syūma-gabhasti,%} ‘having reins as a pole,’ used of
the car of the gods in the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> and independently in the
plural in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> The meaning is, however,
doubtful.<sup>4</sup> Roth<sup>5</sup> himself suggests that {%syūma-gabhasti%} may
refer to a sort of double reins.
