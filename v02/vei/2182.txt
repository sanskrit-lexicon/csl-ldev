{@Bṛbu@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where he is
described as a most generous giver ({%sahasra-dātama%}), and as at
the head of the {@Paṇis.@} According to the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra,<sup>2</sup> {@Bharadvāja@} received gifts from Bṛbu {@Takṣan@} and
[Page2-070+ 54]
{@Prastoka Sārñjaya,@} a fact alluded to in the Mānava Dharma
Śāstra,<sup>3</sup> where {%takṣan%} is treated as a descriptive attribute,
‘a carpenter.’ Apparently Bṛbu was a Paṇi, though the words
of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> might be taken to mean that he was one who
had overthrown them entirely. If so, Paṇi must here certainly
mean a merchant in a good sense, Bṛbu being then a merchant
prince.<sup>4</sup> According to Weber,<sup>5</sup> the name suggests connexion
with Babylon, but this conjecture must be regarded as
quite improbable. Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> sensibly expresses no opinion
as to Bṛbu, while Brunnhofer's<sup>7</sup> attempt to recognize a
people named <lang n="greek">Τάσκοι</lang>, and to connect them with the
Vedic word {%takṣan,%} is valueless, especially considering the
fact that Takṣan is not found as an epithet of Bṛbu in the
Rigveda.

The Bāveru Jātaka, on which stress is
laid in connexion with the Indian know-
ledge of Babylon, being of quite un-

for any early period. {%Cf.%} Bühler, {%Indische%}
