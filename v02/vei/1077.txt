{@Jaitrāyaṇa Saho-jit@}¦ is apparently in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup>
the name of a prince who celebrated the Rājasūya, or ‘royal
consecration.’ Von Schroeder<sup>2</sup> quotes in support of Jaitrā-
yaṇa as a proper name the derivative Jaitrāyaṇi, ‘descendant
of Jaitra,’ formed according to the Gaṇa {%karṇādi,%} which is
referred to by Pāṇini;<sup>3</sup> but it should be noted that in the
parallel passage of the Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> the reading is
different, and no proper personal name appears, the subject
being Indra, the god. This reading seems much more probable,
for the verse should be general, and suit every king performing
the rite.
