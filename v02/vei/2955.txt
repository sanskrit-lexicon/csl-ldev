{@Vi-pāś@}¦ (‘fetterless’) is the name of a river mentioned twice in
the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> It is the modern Beās in the Panjab, the Hyphasis,
Hypanis or Bipasis of the Greeks. Its small importance for the
Vedic Indians is indicated by the fact that it is never mentioned
in the earlier Vedic literature except in two hymns of the Rigveda.
The Nirukta<sup>2</sup> preserves the notice that its earlier name was
{@Uruñjirā,@} while the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> places in the middle
of it the {%Vasiṣṭha-śilāḥ.%} Pāṇinī<sup>4</sup> mentions the name, which
otherwise in post-Vedic literature appears as Vipāśā. This
river has changed its course considerably since ancient times.<sup>5</sup>
<F>1) iii. 33, 1. 3; iv. 30, 11. Yāska,
Nirukta, xi. 48, sees in the latter
passage an adjective {%vi-pāśin,%} but this
is very improbable. See Oldenberg,
{%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} 1, 294.</F>
<F>2) ix. 26. The Vipāś is also mentioned
in connexion with the {@Śutudrī@} in ii. 24;
ix. 36.</F>
