{@Kṣa-pāvan,@}¦ ‘protector of the earth,’<sup>1</sup> is an epithet of a king,<sup>2</sup>
or denotes a king<sup>3</sup> in the Rigveda. The word is significant, as
showing the function of the king as the protector of the tribal
territory.
<F>1) The word occurs only in the
nominative singular as {%kṣapāvān,%} which
would be the regular form from a stem
{%kṣapāvant;%} but it is probably an irregu-
larity for {%kṣapāvā. Cf.%} Oldenberg.
