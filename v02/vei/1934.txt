{@Pṛṣadhra@}¦ occurs in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as
the name of a man. He is also mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana
Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> as a patron of {@Praskaṇva,@} and called Pṛṣadhra
Medhya Mātariśvan (or Mātariśva); but for once there is a
discrepancy between the statement of the Sūtra and the text
of the Rigveda, for the hymns<sup>3</sup> there attributed to Praskaṇva
as in praise of Pṛṣadhra have nothing in them connected with
Pṛṣadhra, while the Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribes to Pṛṣadhra
himself the authorship of one of them.<sup>4</sup> On the other hand,
{@Medhya@} and {@Mātariśvan@} appear as separate persons in the
{@Rigveda@}<sup>1</sup> along with Pṛṣadhra.
