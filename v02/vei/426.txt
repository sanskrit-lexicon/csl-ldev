{@Ṛṇa,@}¦ ‘debt,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
onwards, having apparently been a normal condition among
the Vedic Indians. Reference is often made<sup>2</sup> to debts con-
tracted at dicing. To pay off a debt was called {%ṛṇaṃ saṃ-nī.%}<sup>3</sup>
Allusion is made to debt contracted without intention of
payment.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The result of non-payment of a debt might be very serious:
the dicer might fall into slavery.<sup>5</sup> Debtors, like other male-
factors, such as thieves, were frequently bound by their
creditors to posts ({%dru-pada%}),<sup>6</sup> presumably as a means of
putting pressure on them or their friends to pay up the
debt.
<div n="P"/>The amount of interest payable is impossible to make out.
In one passage of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> an eighth
({%śapha%}) and a sixteenth ({%kalā%}) are mentioned as paid, but it is
quite uncertain whether interest or an instalment of the
principal is meant. Presumably the interest would be paid
in kind.
<div n="P"/>How far a debt was a heritable interest or obligation does
not appear. The Kauśika Sūtra<sup>8</sup> regards three hymns of the
[Page1-110+ 64]
Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> as applicable to the occasion of the payment of
a debt after the creditor's decease. For the payment of a debt.
by a relation of the debtor the evidence is still less clear.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>11</sup> thinks that payments of debt were made in the
presence of witnesses who could be appealed to in case of
dispute. This conclusion is, however, very uncertain, resting
solely on a vague verse in the Atharvaveda.<sup>12</sup>

<F>6) Rv. x. 34, 4, seems to refer rather
to the binding and taking away as a
slave, though Pischel, {%Vedische Studien,%}
1, 228, explains it as the binding of a
debtor for non-payment, interpreting
the obscure verse i. 169, 7, in the same
way. But Av. vi. 115, 2, 3, may refer
to debt, and if this is the meaning the
allusion to binding to a post as a punish-
ment is clear. See, however, Bloom-
field, {%Hymns of the Atharvaveda,%} 528,
n. 1; Whitney, Translation of the
Atharvaveda, 364, who interprets the
hymn as referring only to sin. Rv.
i. 24, 13. 15; Av. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4;
121, 1 {%et seq.,%} are general; while Rv.
vii. 86, 5; Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, refer
to the binding of thieves in the
stocks. {%Cf.%} {@Taskara.@}</F>
