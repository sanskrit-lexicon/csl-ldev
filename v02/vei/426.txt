{@Ṛṇa,@}¦ ‘debt,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>onwards, having apparently been a normal condition among
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Indians. Reference is often made<sup>2</sup> to debts con-
<div n="lb"/>tracted at dicing. To pay off a debt was called {%ṛṇaṃ saṃ-nī.%}<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Allusion is made to debt contracted without intention of
<div n="lb"/>payment.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The result of non-payment of a debt might be very serious:
<div n="lb"/>the dicer might fall into slavery.<sup>5</sup> Debtors, like other male-
<div n="lb"/>factors, such as thieves, were frequently bound by their
<div n="lb"/>creditors to posts ({%dru-pada%}),<sup>6</sup> presumably as a means of
<div n="lb"/>putting pressure on them or their friends to pay up the
<div n="lb"/>debt.
<div n="P"/>The amount of interest payable is impossible to make out.
<div n="lb"/>In one passage of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> an eighth
<div n="lb"/>({%śapha%}) and a sixteenth ({%kalā%}) are mentioned as paid, but it is
<div n="lb"/>quite uncertain whether interest or an instalment of the
<div n="lb"/>principal is meant. Presumably the interest would be paid
<div n="lb"/>in kind.
<div n="P"/>How far a debt was a heritable interest or obligation does
<div n="lb"/>not appear. The Kauśika Sūtra<sup>8</sup> regards three hymns of the
[Page1-110+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> as applicable to the occasion of the payment of
<div n="lb"/>a debt after the creditor's decease. For the payment of a debt.
<div n="lb"/>by a relation of the debtor the evidence is still less clear.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>11</sup> thinks that payments of debt were made in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of witnesses who could be appealed to in case of
<div n="lb"/>dispute. This conclusion is, however, very uncertain, resting
<div n="lb"/>solely on a vague verse in the Atharvaveda.<sup>12</sup>

<F>6) Rv. x. 34, 4, seems to refer rather
<div n="lb"/>to the binding and taking away as a
<div n="lb"/>slave, though Pischel, {%Vedische Studien,%}
<div n="lb"/>1, 228, explains it as the binding of a
<div n="lb"/>debtor for non-payment, interpreting
<div n="lb"/>the obscure verse i. 169, 7, in the same
<div n="lb"/>way. But Av. vi. 115, 2, 3, may refer
<div n="lb"/>to debt, and if this is the meaning the
<div n="lb"/>allusion to binding to a post as a punish-
<div n="lb"/>ment is clear. See, however, Bloom-
<div n="lb"/>field, {%Hymns of the Atharvaveda,%} 528,
<div n="lb"/>n. 1; Whitney, Translation of the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda, 364, who interprets the
<div n="lb"/>hymn as referring only to sin. Rv.

<div n="lb"/>vii. 86, 5; Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, refer
<div n="lb"/>to the binding of thieves in the
