{@Nahus@}¦ occurs several times in the Rigveda, but the exact
sense is not certain. Ludwig<sup>1</sup> sees in the Nahus a tribe on
the {@Sindhu@} (Indus)<sup>2</sup> or {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>3</sup> rich in horses,<sup>4</sup> allied with
the {@Bharatas@} and {@Śimyus,@}<sup>5</sup> connected with {@Kakṣīvant@} and the
{@Vārṣāgiras,@}<sup>6</sup> and having as kings {@Maśarśāra@} and {@Āyavasa.@}<sup>7</sup>
Roth,<sup>8</sup> on the other hand, sees in Nahus the general sense of
‘neighbour’ as opposed to a member of one's own people ({@Viś@});
this interpretation is supported by the occurrence of the phrase
{%nahuṣo nahuṣṭara,%}<sup>9</sup> ‘closer than a neighbour.’ Nahuṣa has the
same sense as Nahus in two passages of the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> but in
[Page1-439+ 58]
one it seems to be intended for the proper name of a man.<sup>11</sup>
Possibly Nahus was originally a man like Manu.<sup>12</sup>

the name of a mythic forefather, cannot
have been that of a forefather recog-
nized by all the tribes, for there is no
passage in which it applies to all men.
Geldner, {%Ṛgveda, Glossar,%} 92, regards
Nahus as a tribe, Nahuṣa as a king.
