{@Druhyu@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned several times in
the Rigveda. In one passage<sup>1</sup> it occurs, in the plural, with the
{@Yadus, Turvaśas, Anus,@} and {@Pūrus,@} suggesting that these are
the famous five peoples of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> Again, the Druhyu
king shared in the defeat of his allies by {@Sudās,@} and appears to
have perished in the waters.<sup>3</sup> In a second passage Druhyu,
Anu, Turvaśa, and Yadu are all mentioned in the singular,<sup>4</sup>
while in another Pūru and Druhyu occur.<sup>5</sup> From the tribal
grouping it is probable that the Druhyus were a north-western
people,<sup>6</sup> and the later tradition of the Epic connects Gāndhāra
and Druhyu.<sup>7</sup>
