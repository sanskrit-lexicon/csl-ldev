{@Tirindira@}¦ is mentioned in a Dānastuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts,’
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as having, along with {@Parśu,@} bestowed gifts
<div n="lb"/>on the singer. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> this state-
<div n="lb"/>ment is represented by a tale that the Kaṇva Vatsa obtained
<div n="lb"/>a gift from Tirindira Pāraśavya, Tirindira and Parśu being
<div n="lb"/>in this version thus treated as one and the same man.
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>3</sup> sees in the Rigvedic passage a proof that the Yadus
<div n="lb"/>had gained a victory over Tirindira, and gave a part of the
<div n="lb"/>booty to the singers; but there is no proof whatever of the
<div n="lb"/>correctness of this interpretation, which Zimmer<sup>4</sup> shows to be
<div n="lb"/>most unlikely. Yadu princes must be meant by Tirindira and
[Page1-311+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>Parśu, though Weber<sup>5</sup> thinks that the singers were Yadus, not
<div n="lb"/>the princes. The latter he holds to have been Iranian ({%cf.%}
<lang n="greek">Τιρίβαζος</lang>, and see {@Parśu@}), and he thinks that in this there is
<div n="lb"/>evidence of continual close relations between India and Iran.
<div n="lb"/>This is perfectly possible, but the evidence for it is rather
<div n="lb"/>slight.
