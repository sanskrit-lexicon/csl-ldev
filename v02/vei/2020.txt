{@Pra-maganda@}¦ is the name of a prince in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>he is mentioned as the king of the {@Kīkaṭas,@} and where he
<div n="lb"/>seems to be designated by the epithet {%naicāśākha,%} ‘belonging
<div n="lb"/>to a low branch or race.’ On the other hand, Yāska<sup>2</sup> takes
<div n="lb"/>Pramaganda to mean the ‘son of a usurer,’ an explanation that
<div n="lb"/>is hardly probable. Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> thinks that {%naicāśākha%} refers
<div n="lb"/>not to Pramaganda, but to the Soma plant, the plant being
<div n="lb"/>called {%nīcāśākha,%} ‘having shoots turned downwards,’ and that
<div n="lb"/>the passage refers to a raid against the Kīkaṭas, who were not
<div n="lb"/>observers of the milk cult or the Soma cult, with the intention
<div n="lb"/>of winning their lands where the Soma grew and where there
<div n="lb"/>were cows. Böhtlingk,<sup>4</sup> however, questions this view, which is
<div n="lb"/>not very probable. A place name is possibly meant by Naicā-
<div n="lb"/>śākha.<sup>5</sup> The name Pramaganda seems un-Āryan.
