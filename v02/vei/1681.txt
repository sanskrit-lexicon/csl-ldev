{@Pari-kṣit@}¦ appears in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as a king in whose
realm, that of the Kurus, prosperity and peace abound. The
verses in which he is celebrated are later<sup>2</sup> called {%Pārikṣityaḥ,%}
and the Brāhmaṇas explain that Agni is {%pari-kṣit%} because he
dwells among men. Hence Roth<sup>3</sup> and Bloomfield<sup>4</sup> regard
Parikṣit in the Atharvaveda not as a human king at all. This
may be correct, but it is not certain. Both Zimmer<sup>5</sup> and
[Page1-494+ 45]
Oldenberg<sup>6</sup> recognize Parikṣit as a real king, a view supported
by the fact that in the later Vedic literature King {@Janamejaya@}
bears the patronymic {@Pārikṣita.@} If this be so, Parikṣit
belonged to the later period, since the Atharvan passage in
which his name occurs is certainly late, and none of the other
Saṃhitās know Parikṣit at all. The Epic<sup>7</sup> makes him grandfather
of Pratiśravas and great-grandfather of Pratīpa, and Zimmer,<sup>5</sup>
probably with justice, compares the Prātisutvana and Pratīpa
found in another late Atharvan passage.<sup>8</sup> But {@Devāpi@} and
{@Śantanu@} cannot be brought into connexion with Pratīpa.<sup>9</sup>

<F>9) Devāpi is really a Brahmin, son
of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa, and not connected directly
with Śantanu. Yāska, Nirukta, ii. 10,
identifies them as brothers and Kurus;
but the former part of the identification
is, no doubt, wrong.</F>
