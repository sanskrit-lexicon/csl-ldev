{@Puṣkara@}¦ is the name in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> of the blue
lotus flower. The Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> mentions its sweet perfume.
The lotus grew in lakes, which were thence called {%puṣkariṇī,%}
‘lotus-bearing.’<sup>4</sup> That the flower was early used for personal
adornment is shown by an epithet of the Aśvins, ‘lotus-
crowned’ ({%puṣkara-sraj%}).<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>Presumably because of its likeness in shape to the flower
of the lotus, the bowl of the ladle is called Puṣkara, perhaps
already in the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> and certainly in the Aitareya Brāh-
maṇa.<sup>7</sup> Moreover, according to the Nirukta,<sup>8</sup> Puṣkara means
‘water,’ a sense actually found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup>
<F>1) vi. 16, 13; vii. 33, 11, may be so
taken, though Roth, St. Petersburg
Dictionary, {%s.v.%} 3, and Geldner, {%Rigveda,%}
{%Glossar,%} 112, prefer to see in these
passages a reference to the bowl of the
sacrificial ladle.</F>
