{@Gāthā@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> usually means only ‘song,’ ‘verse,’
like Gātu.<sup>2</sup> In one passage,<sup>3</sup> however, it already has a more
special sense, as it is classed with {@Nārāśaṃsī@} and {@Raibhī,@} a
collocation repeatedly found later.<sup>4</sup> The commentators identify
the three terms with certain verses of the Atharvaveda,<sup>5</sup> but
Oldenberg<sup>6</sup> has shown that this identification is incorrect for
the Rigveda. Gāthās are often mentioned elsewhere,<sup>7</sup> and are
referred to as metrical in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka,<sup>8</sup> where the
{@Ṛc, Kumbyā,@} and Gāthā are classed as forms of verse. The
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> distinguishes between Ṛc and Gāthā as
divine and human respectively. According to the usage of the
[Page1-225+ 51]
Brāhmaṇas and the liturgical literature, as stated by the St.
Petersburg Dictionary, the Gāthās are, though religious in
content, distinguished from Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman as non-
Vedic — that is, are not Mantras. This view is consistent with
the fact that the phrase {@Yajña-gāthā,@} meaning a verse
summarizing a sacrificial usage, is not rare. The Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> preserves several Gāthās, which generally accord
with this description as epitomizing the sacrifices of famous
kings, and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> states that a Gāthā is
sung at a wedding. Sometimes<sup>12</sup> Gāthā is qualified as
Nārāśaṃsī, where it must be a eulogy of a generous donor.

So Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%}
44, 98, takes Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5,
6, 8, where Sāyaṇa hesitates between
identifying the two and distinguishing
them. It seems reasonable to regard
Gāthā as the wider term which covers,
but is not coextensive with, Nārāśaṃsī.

his commentary on Aitareya Āraṇyaka,
ii. 3, 6: {%prātaḥ prātar anṛtaṃ te vadanti,%}
‘they every morning tell an untruth,’
which is clearly not a Nārāśaṃsī.
