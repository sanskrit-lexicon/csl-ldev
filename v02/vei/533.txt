{@Karmāra,@}¦ the ‘smith,’ is several times mentioned with
approval in the Vedic Saṃhitās.<sup>1</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> smiths
appear with fishermen ({%dhīvānaḥ%}) and chariot-builders ({%ratha-%}
{%kārāḥ%}), all being classified as clever workers ({%manīṣiṇaḥ%}):
possibly a quasi-caste of smiths was already developing from
the guild organization that probably existed.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Little is known of the smith's methods of work and of his
tools. No doubt he smelted ({%dhmā%}) the ore in the fire; hence
he is called {%dhmātṛ,%} the ‘smelter.’<sup>4</sup> Mention is also made of
[Page1-141+ 50]
his bellows of birds' feathers.<sup>5</sup> He made metal vessels ({%gharma%}
{%ayasmaya%})<sup>6</sup> to be put on the fire: even the Soma cup could
occasionally be made of hammered metal ({%ayo-hata%}).<sup>7</sup>

{%disches Leben,%} 252; Bloomfield, {%Hymns%}
{%of the Atharvaveda,%} 144; and Whitney,
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 92,
take the reference to be to ‘skilled
chariot-makers’ ({%dhīvāno ratha-kārāḥ%})
and ‘clever smiths,’ but this is perhaps
less likely. The commentator interprets
{%dhīvānaḥ%} as ‘fishermen’ (in the later
language {%dhīvara%} means both a ‘clever
man’ and a ‘fisherman’).</F>
