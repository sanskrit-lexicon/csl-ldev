{@Pṛṣatī@}¦ in some passages<sup>1</sup> clearly means a ‘speckled’ cow.
The term is, however, generally<sup>2</sup> applied to the team of the
Maruts, when its sense is doubtful. The commentators usually
explain it as ‘speckled antelope.’ But Mahīdhara,<sup>3</sup> followed by
Roth,<sup>4</sup> prefers to see in it a ‘dappled mare’: it is true that the
Maruts are often called<sup>5</sup> {%pṛṣad-aśva,%} which is more naturally
interpreted as ‘having dappled steeds,’ than as ‘having Pṛṣatīs
as steeds.’<sup>6</sup> In the later literature, which Grassmann<sup>7</sup> prefers
to follow, the word means the female of the dappled gazelle.
[Page2-020+ 50]
Aufrecht<sup>8</sup> concurs in the view of Roth, but Max Müller<sup>9</sup> is
inclined to accept the traditional interpretation, while Muir<sup>10</sup>
leaves the matter open.

<F>6) So Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 87, 4. This
view is far-fetched, but is supported,
in so far as the interpretation of Pṛṣatī
and Aśva is concerned, by such passages
as v. 55, 6, where the Maruts are said
to yoke the Pṛṣatīs as {%aśvān%} to their
chariots; but the sense may be ‘horses
(and) dappled (mares).’ See, however,
