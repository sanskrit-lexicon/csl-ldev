{@Savya-ṣṭhā,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Savya-ṣṭhṛ,@}<sup>2</sup> {@Savye-ṣṭha,@}<sup>3</sup> and {@Savya-stha@}<sup>4</sup>
are all various forms of the word for ‘car-fighter,’ as opposed
to {@Sārathi,@} ‘charioteer,’ showing that, as was natural, the
fighter stood on the left of the driver. The commentators<sup>5</sup> are
inclined to see in the Savyaṣṭhā merely another ‘charioteer,’
but this is quite unjustifiable,<sup>6</sup> and is perhaps due to later caste
prejudice against a Śūdra charioteer.
