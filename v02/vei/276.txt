{@Ā-śir@}¦ (‘admixture’) denotes the mixing, and more especially
<div n="lb"/>the milk mixed with the juice, of the Soma before it was
<div n="lb"/>offered to the gods. In this sense it is not rare from the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards. Not milk alone was employed for this
<div n="lb"/>purpose. The epithet ‘having three admixtures’ applied to
<div n="lb"/>Soma<sup>2</sup> is explained by the other epithets, ‘mixed with milk’
<div n="lb"/>({%gavāśir%}), ‘mixed with curds’ ({%dadhy-āśir%}), and ‘mixed with
<div n="lb"/>grain’ ({%yavāśir%}) — all referring to Soma.
