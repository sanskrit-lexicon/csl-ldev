{@Magadha@}¦ is the name of a people who appear throughout
Vedic literature as of little repute. Though the name is not
actually found in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> it occurs in the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup>
where fever is wished away to the {@Gandhāṛis@} and {@Mūjavants,@}
northern peoples, and to the {@Aṅgas@} and Magadhas, peoples of
the east. Again, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>3</sup> the Māgadha, or man of
Magadha, is included as dedicated to {%ati-kruṣṭa,%} ‘loud noise’(?),
while in the {@Vrātya@} hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the Māgadha is
said to be connected with the Vrātya as his Mitra, his Mantra,
his laughter, and his thunder in the four quarters. In the
Śrauta Sūtras<sup>5</sup> the equipment characteristic of the Vrātya is
said to be given, when the latter is admitted into the Āryan
Brahminical community, to a bad Brahmin living in Magadha
({%brahma-bandhu Māgadha-deśīya%}), but this point does not occur
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>6</sup> On the other hand, respectable
Brahmins sometimes lived there, for the Kauṣītaki Āraṇyaka<sup>7</sup>
mentions {@Madhyama, Prātībodhī-putra,@} as {%Magadha-vāsin,%}
‘living in Magadha.’ Oldenberg,<sup>8</sup> however, seems clearly right
in regarding this as unusual.
[Page2-117+ 58]
<div n="P"/>The Magadhas are evidently a people in the Baudhāyana and
other Sūtras,<sup>9</sup> possibly also in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> It is
therefore most improbable that Zimmer<sup>11</sup> can be right in
thinking that in the Yajurveda<sup>3</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the
Māgadha is not a man of Magadha, but a member of the mixed
caste produced by a {@Vaiśya@} marrying a {@Kṣatriya@} woman.<sup>12</sup>
But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some
doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously
tribal names as Māgadha. The fact that the Māgadha is
often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the
assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and
that wandering bards from Magadha were apt to visit the more
western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste,
inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established
castes.
<div n="P"/>The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since
the {@Kīkaṭas@} were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was
in all probability due, as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup> thinks, to the fact that
the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in
accord with the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> that
neither {@Kosala@} nor {@Videha@} were fully Brahminized at an early
date, much less Magadha. Weber<sup>15</sup> suggests two other grounds
that may have influenced the position — the persistence of
aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter
consideration is hardly applicable to the Yajurveda or the
Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if
substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion,
[Page2-118+ 51]
would have some force. The former motive, despite Olden-
berg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter<sup>16</sup> has gone so
far as to suggest that in Magadha the Āryans met and mingled
with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there
is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reason-
able to suppose that the farther east the Āryans penetrated,
the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines.
Modern ethnology confirms this {%a priori%} supposition in so far as
it shows Āryan types growing less and less marked as the
eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not
decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India.
