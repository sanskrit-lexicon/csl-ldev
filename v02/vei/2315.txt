{@Magadha@}¦ is the name of a people who appear throughout
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature as of little repute. Though the name is not
<div n="lb"/>actually found in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> it occurs in the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where fever is wished away to the {@Gandhāṛis@} and {@Mūjavants,@}
<div n="lb"/>northern peoples, and to the {@Aṅgas@} and Magadhas, peoples of
<div n="lb"/>the east. Again, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
<div n="lb"/>(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>3</sup> the Māgadha, or man of
<div n="lb"/>Magadha, is included as dedicated to {%ati-kruṣṭa,%} ‘loud noise’(?),
<div n="lb"/>while in the {@Vrātya@} hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the Māgadha is
<div n="lb"/>said to be connected with the Vrātya as his Mitra, his Mantra,
<div n="lb"/>his laughter, and his thunder in the four quarters. In the
<div n="lb"/>Śrauta Sūtras<sup>5</sup> the equipment characteristic of the Vrātya is
<div n="lb"/>said to be given, when the latter is admitted into the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>Brahminical community, to a bad Brahmin living in Magadha
<div n="lb"/>({%brahma-bandhu Māgadha-deśīya%}), but this point does not occur
<div n="lb"/>in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>6</sup> On the other hand, respectable
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins sometimes lived there, for the Kauṣītaki Āraṇyaka<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions {@Madhyama, Prātībodhī-putra,@} as {%Magadha-vāsin,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘living in Magadha.’ Oldenberg,<sup>8</sup> however, seems clearly right
<div n="lb"/>in regarding this as unusual.
[Page2-117+ 58]
<div n="P"/>The Magadhas are evidently a people in the Baudhāyana and
<div n="lb"/>other Sūtras,<sup>9</sup> possibly also in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>therefore most improbable that Zimmer<sup>11</sup> can be right in
<div n="lb"/>thinking that in the Yajurveda<sup>3</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Māgadha is not a man of Magadha, but a member of the mixed
<div n="lb"/>caste produced by a {@Vaiśya@} marrying a {@Kṣatriya@} woman.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some
<div n="lb"/>doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously
<div n="lb"/>tribal names as Māgadha. The fact that the Māgadha is
<div n="lb"/>often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the
<div n="lb"/>assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and
<div n="lb"/>that wandering bards from Magadha were apt to visit the more
<div n="lb"/>western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste,
<div n="lb"/>inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established
<div n="lb"/>castes.
<div n="P"/>The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since
<div n="lb"/>the {@Kīkaṭas@} were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was
<div n="lb"/>in all probability due, as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup> thinks, to the fact that
<div n="lb"/>the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in
<div n="lb"/>accord with the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> that
<div n="lb"/>neither {@Kosala@} nor {@Videha@} were fully Brahminized at an early
<div n="lb"/>date, much less Magadha. Weber<sup>15</sup> suggests two other grounds
<div n="lb"/>that may have influenced the position — the persistence of
<div n="lb"/>aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter
<div n="lb"/>consideration is hardly applicable to the Yajurveda or the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if
<div n="lb"/>substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion,
[Page2-118+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>would have some force. The former motive, despite Olden-
<div n="lb"/>berg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter<sup>16</sup> has gone so
<div n="lb"/>far as to suggest that in Magadha the Āryans met and mingled
<div n="lb"/>with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there
<div n="lb"/>is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reason-
<div n="lb"/>able to suppose that the farther east the Āryans penetrated,
<div n="lb"/>the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines.
<div n="lb"/>Modern ethnology confirms this {%a priori%} supposition in so far as
<div n="lb"/>it shows Āryan types growing less and less marked as the
<div n="lb"/>eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not
<div n="lb"/>decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India.
