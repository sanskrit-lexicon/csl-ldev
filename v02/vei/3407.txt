{@Śveta-ketu@}¦ Aruṇeya<sup>1</sup> (‘descendant of {@Aruṇa@}’) or {@Auddālaki@}<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>(‘son of {@Uddālaka@}’) is mentioned repeatedly in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. In the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> he appears as Śvetaketu, son of {@Āruṇi,@} and as a
<div n="lb"/>{@Gautama.@} In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> he is quoted as an
<div n="lb"/>authority on the vexed question of the duty of the {@Sadasya,@} or
<div n="lb"/>the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kauṣītakins, to
<div n="lb"/>notify errors in the sacrifice; Āruṇi, his father, is also cited.
<div n="lb"/>He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating
<div n="lb"/>honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that
<div n="lb"/>delicacy by Brahmacārins or religious students.<sup>5</sup> He was a
<div n="lb"/>contemporary of, and was instructed by the {@Pañcāla@} king
<div n="lb"/>{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivala.@}<sup>6</sup> He was also a contemporary of {@Janaka,@}
<div n="lb"/>of {@Videha,@} and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his
<div n="lb"/>court.<sup>7</sup> A story is told of him in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra:<sup>8</sup> {@Jala Jātūkarṇya@} was lucky enough to become the
<div n="lb"/>Purohita of three peoples or kings, of {@Kāśi, Kosala,@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Videha.@} Seeing this, Śvetaketu felt annoyed and reproached
<div n="lb"/>his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely
<div n="lb"/>enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied,
<div n="lb"/>forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method
<div n="lb"/>of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it
<div n="lb"/>with every Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>All the references to Śvetaketu belong to the latest period of
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Āpa-
<div n="lb"/>stamba Dharma Sūtra<sup>9</sup> should refer to him as an Avara, or
[Page2-410+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>person of later days, who still became a Ṛṣi by special merit.
<div n="lb"/>His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in which he plays so marked a part is
<div n="lb"/>certainly earlier than Pāṇini, and was apparently even in that
<div n="lb"/>grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence
<div n="lb"/>500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for
<div n="lb"/>Śvetaketu as a rough approximation to a date.<sup>10</sup>
