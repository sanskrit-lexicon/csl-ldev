2. {@Varṇa@}¦ (lit. ‘colour’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> is applied to denote
classes of men, the {@Dāsa@} and the Āryan Varṇa being contrasted,
as other passages<sup>2</sup> show, on account of colour. But this use is
confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the
Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Saṃhitās and
Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> where the four castes ({%varṇāḥ%}) are already fully
recognized.
<div n="P"/>{%(a) Caste in the Rigveda.%} — The use of the term Varṇa is not,
of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed
in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have
existed: the Puruṣa-sūkta, ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth
[Page2-248+ 49]
Maṇḍala<sup>4</sup> clearly contemplates the division of mankind into
four classes — the Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. But
the hymn being admittedly late,<sup>5</sup> its evidence is not cogent for
the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer<sup>6</sup> has with great force com-
batted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society
that knew the caste system. He points out that the Brāh-
maṇas<sup>7</sup> show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrah-
minized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the
Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region
and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had
wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the
caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir,<sup>8</sup> derived
from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that ({%a%}) the
four castes appear only in the late Puruṣasūkta; ({%b%}) the term
Varṇa, as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later
times, and is only contrasted with Dāsa; ({%c%}) that Brāhmaṇa is
rare in the Rigveda, Kṣatriya occurs seldom,<sup>9</sup> Rājanya only in
the Puruṣasūkta, where too, alone, Vaiśya and Śūdra are
found; ({%d%}) that Brahman denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and
then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest;
({%e%}) that in some only of the passages<sup>10</sup> where it occurs does
Brahman denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it
denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a
person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to
receive divine inspiration.<sup>11</sup> Brāhmaṇa, on the other hand, as
Muir admits,<sup>12</sup> already denotes a hereditary professional priest-
hood.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the
Rigveda to the elaborate system of the Yajurveda with the
[Page2-249+ 46]
advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Ger-
manic invasions that transformed the German tribes into
monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a
conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink
to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines
or of other Āryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the
subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the
shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility
of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers,
as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon
monarchies.<sup>13</sup> At the same time the people ceased to take
part in military matters, and under climatic influences
left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers,
devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and
trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the
people was shared by them with the priesthood, the
origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth
first saw.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the
people, but the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> itself shows cases, like those of
{@Viśvāmitra@} and {@Vasiṣṭha@} illustrating forcibly the power of the
Purohita, though at the same time the right of the noble to act
as Purohita is seen in the case of {@Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa.@}<sup>16</sup> The
Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of
gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of
the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many
struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition.<sup>17</sup>
The Atharvaveda<sup>18</sup> also preserves relics of these conflicts in its
narration of the ruin of the {@Sṛñjayas@} because of oppressing
Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viii-
xii), the Śatarudriya litany of the Yajurveda<sup>19</sup> reflects the
period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was
[Page2-250+ 56]
still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as
the patron god of all sorts of evil doers.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>This version of the development of caste has received a good
deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be
regarded as the recognized version.<sup>21</sup> It has, however, always
been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug,<sup>22</sup> Kern,<sup>23</sup>
Ludwig,<sup>24</sup> and more recently by Oldenberg<sup>25</sup> and by Geldner.<sup>26</sup>
The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing
at once that the caste system is one that has progressively
developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda
the full caste system even of the Yajurveda; but at the same
time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on
its way to general acceptance. The argument from the non-
brahminical character of the {@Vrātyas@} of the Indus and Panjab
loses its force when it is remembered that there is much
evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the
Rigveda, especially the books<sup>27</sup> in which {@Sudās@} appears with
Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in the east, the later {@Madhyadeśa,@} a
view supported by Pischel,<sup>28</sup> Geldner,<sup>29</sup> Hopkins,<sup>30</sup> and Mac-
donell.<sup>31</sup> Nor is it possible to maintain that Brahman in the
Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by
Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary pro-
fession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs
where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest
was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the
Rigveda of the threefold<sup>32</sup> or fourfold<sup>33</sup> division of the people
[Page2-251+ 41]
into {%brahma, kṣatram,%} and {%viśaḥ,%} or into the three classes and
the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period,
any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards
the Vaiśyas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently<sup>34</sup>
knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers,
but the late Atharvaveda<sup>35</sup> equally classes the folk with the
{%bala,%} ‘power,’ representing the Viś as associated with the {@Sabhā,@}
{@Samiti,@} and {@Senā,@} the assemblies of the people and the armed
host. Zimmer<sup>36</sup> explains these references as due to tradition
only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it
does, on the false assumption that only a Kṣatriya can fight.
But it is (see {@Kṣatriya@}) very doubtful whether Kṣatriya means
anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in
the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased
in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though
later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars,
an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated
as an absolute one. The Kṣatriyas were no doubt a hereditary
body; monarchy was already hereditary (see {@Rājan@}), and it is
admitted that the Śūdras were a separate body: thus all the
elements of the caste system were already in existence. The
Purohita, indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is
clear, as Oldenberg<sup>37</sup> urges, that he was not the creator of the
power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence
he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice
required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary
priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred know-
ledge.
<div n="P"/>Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste
system be derived from cases like that of {@Devāpi.@} For, in the
first place, the Upaniṣads show kings in the exercise of the
priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upaniṣads
are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system.
In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for
Devāpi, who certainly acts as Purohita, is not stated in the
[Page2-252+ 61]
Rigveda to be a prince at all, though Yāska<sup>38</sup> calls him a
Kauravya; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be
vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again,
the Brāhmaṇas do not scruple to recognize Rājanyarṣis, or
‘royal sages’; and the famous Viśvāmitra shows in the Rigveda
no sign of the royal character which the Brāhmaṇas insist
on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of
{@Jahnu.@}<sup>39</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%(b) Caste in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.%} — The relation
between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history
of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the
hardening of a system already formed by the time of the
Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>1. {%The Names of the Castes.%} — The most regular names are
Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra,<sup>40</sup> or later Brāhmaṇa,
Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra.<sup>41</sup> There are many other variants:
Brahman, Kṣatra, Śūdrāryau;<sup>42</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Śūdra,
Ārya;<sup>43</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Vaiśya, Śūdra;<sup>44</sup> Brāhmaṇa, Rājan,
Viśya, Śūdra;<sup>45</sup> Deva, Rājan, Śūdra, Ārya;<sup>46</sup> and Brahman,
Kṣatra, Viś, and Śūdra.<sup>47</sup> In other cases the fourth class is repre-
sented by a special member: Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and
Cāṇḍāla.<sup>48</sup> Often only the three upper classes are mentioned,
as Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya;<sup>49</sup> Brahman, Kṣatram, Viś,<sup>50</sup>
[Page2-253+ 64]
etc.<sup>51</sup> Three castes — Brāhmaṇa, Rājan, Śūdra — are mentioned
in the Atharvaveda,<sup>52</sup> and two castes are repeatedly men-
tioned together, either Brahman and Kṣatra, or Kṣatra and
Viś.<sup>53</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%The Relation of the Castes.%} — The ritual literature is full of
minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example,
the Śatapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for
the four castes,<sup>54</sup> Different modes of address are laid down for
the four castes,<sup>55</sup> as {%ehi,%} ‘approach’; {%āgaccha,%} ‘come’; {%ādrava,%}
‘run up’; {%ādhāva,%} ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of
politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities.<sup>56</sup>
The Sūtras have many similar rules.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly
from the fourth, the Śūdras. The latter are in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>58</sup> declared not fit to be addressed by a Dīkṣita,
‘consecrated person,’ and no Śūdra is to milk the cow whose
milk is to be used for the Agnihotra<sup>59</sup> (‘fire-oblation’). On the
other hand, in certain passages, the Śūdra is given a place in
the Soma sacrifice,<sup>60</sup> and in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>61</sup> there
are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only
for the three upper castes, but also for the {@Rathakāra,@}
[Page2-254+ 57]
‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>62</sup> the Brāh-
maṇa is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of
the other three castes.
<div n="P"/>The characteristics of the several castes are given under
{@Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya@} and {@Rājan, Vaiśya, Śūdra:@} they may be
briefly summed up as follows: The Viś forms the basis of the
state on which the Brahman and Kṣatra rest;<sup>63</sup> the Brahman
and Kṣatra are superior to the Viś;<sup>64</sup> while all three classes are
superior to the Śūdras. The real power of the state rested with
the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be
deemed the Kṣatriya element. Engaged in the business of the
protection of the country, its administration, the decision of
legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the
revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to
them villages (see {@Grāma@}) for their maintenance, while some of
them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by
slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small:<sup>65</sup> there
are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the
mention of {@Mahārājas.@} The people, engaged in agriculture,
pastoral pursuits, and trade ({@Vaṇij@}), paid tribute to the king
and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as Baden-
Powell suggests,<sup>66</sup> they were not themselves agriculturists is
probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large
scale, and draw their revenues from Śūdra tenants, or even
Āryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this
[Page2-255+ 70]
position is extremely unlikely.<sup>67</sup> In war the people shared
the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute
separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests
may be divided into two classes — the Purohitas of the kings,
who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a
position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident
they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives,
except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king
or a wealthy noble.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up
in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>69</sup> which treats of them
as opposed to the Kṣatriya. The Brāhmaṇa is a receiver of
gifts ({%ā-dāyī%}), a drinker of Soma ({%ā-pāyī%}), a seeker of food
({%āvasāyī%}),<sup>70</sup> and liable to removal at will ({%yathākāma-prayāpyaḥ%}).<sup>71</sup>
The Vaiśya is tributary to another ({%anyasya balikṛt%}), to be lived
on by another ({%anyasyādyaḥ%}), and to be oppressed at will ({%yathā-%}
{%kāma-jyeyaḥ%}).<sup>72</sup> The Śūdra is the servant of another ({%anyasya%}
{%preṣyaḥ%}), to be expelled at will ({%kāmotthāpyaḥ%}), and to be slain
[Page2-256+ 54]
at pleasure ({%yathākāma-vadhyaḥ%}).<sup>73</sup> The descriptions seem
calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the
Rājanya. Even the Brāhmaṇa he can control, whilst the
Vaiśya is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove
without cause from his land,<sup>74</sup> but who is still free, and whom
he cannot maim or slay without due process. The Śūdra has
no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the
king.
<div n="P"/>The passage is a late one, and the high place of the Kṣatriya
is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in
the course of time the Vaiśya fell more and more in position
with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber<sup>75</sup> shows
reason for believing that the Vājapeya sacrifice, a festival of
which a chariot race forms an integral part,<sup>76</sup> was, as the
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>77</sup> says, once a sacrifice for a Vaiśya,
as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer
diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the
Taittirīya texts<sup>78</sup> show that the Vājapeya was originally a lesser
sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the
Rājasūya, or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings,
and in that of the Brahmin by the Bṛhaspatisava, a festival
celebrated on his appointment as a royal Purohita. But the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>79</sup> exalts the Vājapeya, in which a priest
could be the sacrificer, over the Rājasūya, from which he was
excluded, and identifies it with the Bṛhaspatisava, a clear piece
of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we
must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the
exaltation of the Purohita in the later books of the Śatapatha
[Page2-257+ 60]
and Aitareya Brāhmaṇas as evidence of a real growth in the
priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests
of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in
the Madhyadeśa. Another side of the picture is presented in
the Pāli literature,<sup>80</sup> which, belonging to a later period than the
Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests;
while the Epic,<sup>81</sup> more nearly contemporaneous with the later
Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal
superiority of the nobility in clear light.
<div n="P"/>Although clear distinctions were made between the different
castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the
leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity com-
municated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes,<sup>82</sup>
which is seen both directly in the purification rendered
necessary in case of contact with a Śūdra, and indirectly in the
prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste.<sup>83</sup> It
is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does
appear,<sup>84</sup> but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to
preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain
rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the
same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire
the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental com-
munion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to
take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying
[Page2-258+ 58]
purity.<sup>85</sup> Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the
constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals
which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not
found even in the Epic or in the Pāli literature.<sup>86</sup> The Vedic
characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common
occupation, and restriction on intermarriage.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Restrictions on Intermarriage.%} — Arrian, in his {%Indica,%}<sup>87</sup>
probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibi-
tion of marriage between <lang n="greek">γένη</lang>, no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic
of Indian life. The evidence of Pāli literature<sup>88</sup> is in favour of
this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he
wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir apparent.
But it equally shows that there were others who held that not
the father's but the mother's rank determined the social
standing of the son. Though Manu<sup>89</sup> recognizes the possibility
of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate
children, still he condemns the marriage of an Āryan with
a woman of lower caste. The Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>90</sup> allows
the marriage of a Kṣatriya with a wife of his own caste or of
the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or
of the two lower classes, and of a Vaiśya with a Vaiśya wife
only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can
marry a Śūdra wife, while other authorities condemn the
marriage with a Śūdra wife in certain circumstances, which
implies that in other cases it might be justified.<sup>91</sup> The earlier
[Page2-259+ 64]
literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on
descent from a Ṛṣi, and on purity of descent;<sup>92</sup> but there is
other evidence for the view that even a Brāhmaṇa need not be
of pure lineage. {@Kavaṣa@} Ailūṣa is taunted with being the son
of a Dāsī, ‘slave woman,’<sup>93</sup> and {@Vatsa@} was accused of being a
Śūdrā's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt
through the flames of a fire ordeal.<sup>94</sup> He who is learned
({%śuśruvān%}) is said to be a Brāhmaṇa, descended from a Ṛṣi
({%ārṣeya%}), in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>95</sup> and {@Satyakāma,@} son of
{@Jabālā,@} was accepted as a pupil by {@Hāridrumata@} Gautama,
though he could not name his father.<sup>96</sup> The Kāṭhaka Saṃ-
hitā<sup>97</sup> says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But
all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity
in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based
on heredity. The Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>98</sup> recognize the illicit
union of Ārya and Śūdrā, and {%vice versa:%} it is not unlikely that
if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible.
The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>99</sup> indeed, recognizes such a case in
that of {@Dīrghatamas,@} son of the slave girl Uśij, if we may
adopt the description of Uśij given in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>In a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>101</sup> extreme claims are put
[Page2-260+ 54]
forward for the Brāhmaṇa, who alone is a true husband and
the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a Rājanya
or a Vaiśya: a Śūdra husband is not mentioned, probably on
purpose.<sup>102</sup> The marriage of Brāhmaṇas with Rājanya women
is illustrated by the cases of {@Sukanyā,@} daughter of king
{@Śaryāta,@} who married {@Cyavana,@}<sup>103</sup> and of {@Rathavīti's@} daughter,
who married {@Śyāvāśva.@}<sup>104</sup>
<div n="P"/>4. {%Occupation and Caste.%} — The Greek authorities<sup>105</sup> and the
evidence of the Jātakas<sup>106</sup> concur in showing it to have been
the general rule that each caste was confined to its own
occupations, but that the Brāhmaṇas did engage in many
professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave
members to the Śramaṇas, or homeless ascetics. The Jātakas<sup>107</sup>
recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations,
as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are
somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Brāhmaṇas
and Kṣatriyas appear as practically confined to their own pro-
fessions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions.
Ludwig<sup>108</sup> sees in {@Dīrghaśravas@} in the Rigveda<sup>109</sup> a Brahmin
reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even
later by the Sūtra literature; but this is not certain, though it
is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far
the Kṣatriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here
is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of
{@Viśvāmitra.@} In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest
who is attached to the court of {@Sudās,@} king of the {@Tṛtsus;@} but
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>110</sup> he is called a king, a descendant
of {@Jahnu,@} and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>111</sup> refers to {@Śunaḥśepa's@}
[Page2-261+ 52]
succeeding, through his adoption by Viśvāmitra, to the divine
lore ({%daiva veda%}) of the {@Gāthins@} and the lordship of the Jahnus.
That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable,
but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal
origin. Such figures appear more than once in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> which knows the technical terms {@Rājanyarṣi@} and
{@Devarājan@} corresponding to the later Rājarṣi, ‘royal sage.’ The
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>113</sup> says of one who knows a certain
doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ ({%rājā sann ṛṣir%}
{%bhavati%}), and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>114</sup> applies the
term Rājanya to a Brāhmaṇa. Again, it is argued that {@Devāpi@}
{@Ārṣṭiṣeṇa,@} who acted as Purohita, according to the Rigveda,<sup>115</sup>
for {@Śantanu,@} was a prince, as Yāska<sup>116</sup> says or implies he
was.<sup>117</sup> But this assumption seems to be only an error of
Yāska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relation-
ship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view<sup>118</sup> that the Rigveda
recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince
acting the part of Purohita as unusual and requiring explanation.
The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in
the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir<sup>119</sup> has argued
that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sāyaṇa,<sup>120</sup> regards many
hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he
admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be
added that in the case of {@Pṛthī Vainya,@} where the hymn<sup>121</sup>
ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn
itself that he is other than a seer; the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup>
calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than
the later tradition as to Viśvāmitra. The case of {@Viśvantara@}
[Page2-262+ 54]
and the {@Śyāparṇas@} mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>123</sup> has
been cited<sup>124</sup> as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid,
but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of
the {@Kaśyapas, Asitamṛgas,@} and {@Bhūtavīras@} mentioned in the
course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king
had other priests to carry out the sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the
Upaniṣads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal
persons. Thus {@Janaka@} is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>125</sup>
to have become a Brahman; {@Ajātaśatru@} taught {@Gārgya@}
{@Bālāki;@}<sup>126</sup> {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali@} instructed {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@}<sup>127</sup>
as well as {@Śilaka Śālāvatya@}<sup>128</sup> and {@Caikitāyana Dālbhya;@}
and {@Aśvapati Kaikeya@} taught Brahmins.<sup>129</sup> It has been
deduced<sup>130</sup> from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a
product of the Kṣatriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely
doubtful,<sup>131</sup> for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by
the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere<sup>132</sup>
the opinion of a Rājanya is treated with contempt.
<div n="P"/>It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not
much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though
it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But
that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste
took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example.
That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have
taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick<sup>133</sup>
points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the
later period at least, become a Śramaṇa, as is recorded in effect
[Page2-263+ 53]
of many kings in the Epic.<sup>134</sup> Whether the practice is Vedic is
not clear: Yāska<sup>135</sup> records it of Devāpi, but this is not evidence
for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas,
accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the
mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight,<sup>136</sup> as Vasiṣṭha
and Viśvāmitra seem to have done, and as priests do even in
the Epic from time to time.<sup>137</sup> But a priest cannot be said to
change caste by acting in this way.
<div n="P"/>More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of
caste may be seen in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>138</sup> where
{@Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana@} is represented as speaking of his off-
spring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and
commons of the Śalvas; and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>139</sup>
where Viśvantara is told that if the wrong offering were made
his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken Ṛṣi
of the Rigveda<sup>140</sup> talks as if he could be converted into a king.
On the other hand, certain kings, such as {@Para Āṭṇāra,@} are
spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’<sup>141</sup> As
evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a
Brahmin might become a king, while the Ṛṣi in the Rigveda is
represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great
kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were
consecrated ({%dīkṣita%}), and so temporarily became Brahmins.<sup>142</sup>
The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would
be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is
not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of
Satyakāma Jābāla do not go far; for {%ex hypothesi%} that teacher
[Page2-264+ 40]
did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite
well have been a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles
practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a
closed body into which a man must be born. These two
Varṇas may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vaiśyas
offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of
occupations (see {@Vaiśya@}). Fick<sup>143</sup> concludes that there is no
exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the
Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups,
which themselves practised endogamy such as the {%gahapatis,%} or
smaller landowners, the {%setthis,%} or large merchants and members
of the various guilds, while there are clear traces<sup>144</sup> in the legal
textbooks of a view that Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya stand opposed
to all the other members of the community. But we need
hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the Vaiśya, the
ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all
probability, which was severed by its free status from the
Śūdras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble
blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably
legitimate to hold that any Vaiśya could marry any member of
the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of
Vaiśyas are growths of divisions parallel with the original
process by which priest and noble had grown into separate
entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall
under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the
social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on
equal terms — hypergamy is often allowed — and so those Vaiśyas
who acquired wealth in trade ({@Śreṣṭhin@}) or agriculture (the
Pāli Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the
ordinary Vaiśyas. But it is not legitimate to regard Vaiśya as
a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process
of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of
occupation, religion, or geographical situation.
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>145</sup> denies also that the Śūdras ever formed a single
[Page2-265+ 43]
caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior
races and tribes defeated by the Āryan invaders, but originally
as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose
that Śūdra was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the
nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside
the three castes — nobles, priests, and people — just as in the
Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests,
the {%nobiles%} or eorls, and the {%ingenui,%} ordinary freemen or ceorls,
there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic
expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see
{@Śūdra@}). In the Āryan view a marriage of Śūdras could hardly
be regulated by rules; any Śūdra could wed another, if such a
marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in
early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But
what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less
and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and
princes must have come into the Āryan community by peaceful
means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and
when the term Śūdra would cover many sorts of people who
were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character
occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of
the village, like the {@Caṇḍālas,@} or tribes living under Āryan
control, or independent, such as the {@Niṣādas.@}
<div n="P"/>But it is also probable that the Śūdras came to include men
of Āryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation
of Āryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to
have been the case with the {@Rathakāras.@} In the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>146</sup> the Rathakāra is placed as a special class along
with the Brāhmaṇas, Rājanyas, and Vaiśyas: this can hardly
be interpreted except to mean that the Rathakāras were not
included in the Āryan classes, though it is just possible that
only a subdivision of the Vaiśyas is meant. There is other
evidence<sup>147</sup> that the Rathakāras were regarded as Śūdras. But
in the Atharvaveda<sup>148</sup> the Rathakāras and the {@Karmāras@}
appear in a position of importance in connexion with the
[Page2-266+ 50]
selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in
an honourable way in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā;<sup>149</sup> in the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>150</sup> too, the Rathakāra is mentioned as a
a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view
suggested by Fick<sup>151</sup> that these classes were originally non-
Āryan; we must recognize that the Rathakāras, in early Vedic
times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of
the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified.
The development of this idea was a departure from the Āryan
conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has
a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe.
Similarly, the Karmāra, the {@Takṣan,@}<sup>152</sup> the Carmamna, or
‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupa-
tions in the Rigveda, are reckoned as Śūdras in the Pāli
texts.<sup>153</sup>
<div n="P"/>The later theory, which appears fully developed in the
Dharma Sūtras,<sup>154</sup> deduces the several castes other than the
original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This
theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In
some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the {@Sūta@} is said
to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if
the Sūtas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to
occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Sūtas,
Grāmaṇīs, and other members of occupations were real castes
in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic
period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress
by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an
important determining feature, just as in modern times there
are castes bearing names like Gopāla (‘cowherd’) Kaivarta or
Dhīvara (‘fisherman’), and Vaṇij (‘merchant’).<sup>155</sup>
[Page2-267+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>156</sup> finds in the Jātakas mention of a number of occupa-
tions whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such
as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who
went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in
the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times
these people presumably fell under the conception of Śūdra,
and may have included the {@Parṇaka, Paulkasa, Bainda,@} who
are mentioned with many others in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa in the list of victims at the
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom
Fick<sup>157</sup> includes in the same category, were certainly included
in the term Śūdra.
<div n="P"/>5. {%Origin of the Castes.%} — The question of the origin of the
castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the
extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with
the features of any other Āryan society, must probably be
sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning
between the Āryan and the Śūdra. The contrast which the
Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the
conquered population, and which probably rested originally on
the difference of colour between the upper and the lower
classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth,
occupation, and locality which normally existed among the
Āryan Indians, but which among other Āryan peoples never
developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine
of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste
system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the Āryan
could marry the Śūdrā, but not the Śūdra the Āryā. This
distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its
force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to
mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of
America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between
the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population
which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons
of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but
varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of
a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race;
[Page2-268+ 45]
(2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage
between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark
race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each
category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation
than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is
what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears,
then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best repre-
sented by Risley,<sup>158</sup> which explains caste in the main as a
matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is,
the greater is the proportion of Āryan blood.
<div n="P"/>The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart,<sup>159</sup>
which places the greatest stress on the Āryan constitution of
the family. According to Senart the Āryan people practised in
affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy.
A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the
same {%gens,%} according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart
and Kovalevsky;<sup>160</sup> and an Athenian must marry an Athenian
woman, but not one of the same <lang n="greek">γένος</lang>. In India these rules
are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within
the {@Gotra,@} but not without the caste. The theory, though
attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek
parallels are not even probably accurate;<sup>161</sup> and in India the
rule forbidding marriage within the Gotra is one which grows;
in strictness as the evidence grows later in date.<sup>162</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the
development of caste may have been helped by the family
traditions of some {%gentes,%} or <lang n="greek">γένη</lang>, or Gotras. The Patricians
of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the
plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their
<lang n="greek">γένη</lang> pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and
there may well have been noble families among the Vedic
Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The
[Page2-269+ 49]
Germans known to Tacitus<sup>163</sup> were divided into {%nobiles%} and
{%ingenui,%} and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble
and non-noble freemen.<sup>164</sup> The origin of nobility need not be
sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have
existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom
we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king
often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of,
the deity;<sup>165</sup> and that hereditary kingship would tend to
increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the
royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain
the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the
king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in
the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar
exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences
that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep
opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines.
<div n="P"/>Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions.
Nesfield<sup>166</sup> was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of
caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view
considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly
certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The
carpenters ({@Takṣan@}), the chariot-makers ({@Rathakāra@}), the fisher-
men ({@Dhaivara@}) and others are clearly of the type of caste, and
the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to
say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its
first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have
produced the system of caste without the interposition of the
fundamental difference between Āryan and Dāsa or Śūdra
blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly impor-
tant what the history of the Āryan peoples shows us to be
declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble
[Page2-270+ 77]
freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which
seems to have been developed in the Āryan people before the
separation of its various branches.
<div n="P"/>It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division
of classes comparable in some respects<sup>167</sup> with the Indian
polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are
unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to
correspond closely to the Pāli Gahapatis, and perhaps to the
Śūdras.<sup>168</sup> But they are certainly not castes in the Indian
sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of
Senart<sup>169</sup> or of Risley<sup>170</sup> that the names of the old classes were
later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were
different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes
existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed
by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early
Brāhmaṇa evidence for the four Varṇas, and treating the
transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes
and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no
Varṇa, caste might never have arisen; both colour and class
occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste.<sup>171</sup>

The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the later
parts of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, with
their traditions of Aśvamedhas, ‘horse
sacrifices,’ and their recollections of
the glories of the {@Bharatas,@} represent
a more advanced stage of social rela-
tions and of city life, but even they
hardly know really great kingdoms.</F>
<F>66) {%Indian Village Community%} and {%Village%}
{%Communities in India,%} where much stress
is laid on the idea of a settlement of
Āryans on lands already occupied by
Dravidian clans, much as Anglo-Saxon
invaders on one theory occupied lands
already held by Britons who became
serfs, while the invaders were a land-
holding aristocracy, a theory supported
by the fact that the normal holding of
a hide is estimated at 120 acres.</F>
<F>67) {%Cf.%} Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%}
222. The point is much the same as that
at issue between the different schools of
opinion as to early English history.
Did the Āryans in India occupy the
land as a people, driving out or ex-
terminating or enslaving the Dāsas,
and themselves carrying on the occupa-
tions of a people, or did they merely
form a small aristocracy of superior
military force, and were the Kṣatriyas
the true Āryans? The evidence of the
Rigveda is really fatal to the latter
alternative hypothesis.</F>
<F>68) For the superiority of the Brāh-
maṇa to the Kṣatriya or Rājanya, see
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 11, 3; Vāja-
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21; Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 1, 12; 4, 4, 15; xiii. 1,
9, 1; 3, 7, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
vii. 15, 8; viii. 9, 6; Śāṅkhāyana
Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 20, 12. The Brāh-
maṇa is, in his turn, dependent on the
king (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 3;
v. 4, 2, 7), and at the Rājasūya sits
beside him, but is none the less superior
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 23).
The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5, says
the Kṣatra is over the Brahman, but
this is not a usual view. {%Cf.%} xxvii. 4.
A Brāhmaṇa can get along without a
Kṣatriya, but not {%vice versa%} (Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, 6), and a Rājanya
with a Brāhmaṇa surpasses all other
Rājanyas (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1,
10, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 10;
xxvii. 4, etc.).</F>
<F>69) vii. 29. See Muir, {%op. cit.,%} 1^2, 436
{%et seq.;%} Weber, {%Indische Studien,%} 10, 14.</F>
<F>70) Weber, {%op. cit.,%} 9, 326; 10, 14,
prefers ‘moving’ or ‘dwelling’ every-
where.</F>
<F>71) Muir, Haug, and Weber take the
word as active in sense, ‘moving at
will.’ But both the parallelism of the
passage and the formation of the word
require a passive causative sense. The
reference is perhaps to the general
political control of the king over the
priest, whom he can ‘move on’ from
place to place.</F>

great importance to the question of
eating together, and compares the sacri-
ficial meals of the {%gens%} at Rome, where
strangers were excluded (Fustel de
Coulanges, {%La Cité Antique,%} 117). But
this is not conclusive; a caste is not
a {%gens,%} and the {%gens%} excluded strangers
only at a solemn festival, when the
whole {%gens%} renewed its blood kinship.
If we have no evidence exactly estab-
lishing this for the Gotra in early Vedic
literature, we need not hesitate to
believe that in the earliest Vedic period
the Gotra had solemn festivals of union,
and of communication with the dead,
but that again does not explain or
amount to the caste prohibition of
taking food from an inferior.</F>
<F>84) {%E.g.,%} Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3.
with Keith's note.</F>
<F>85) For a case of objection to eating
food after another, see Chāndogya
Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1. Possibly the idea
there is that eating the food of a chief
is dangerous, since the eater thus enters
into possession of part of his sub-
stance, and consequently at once be-
comes an object of anger to the chief,
as well as of danger to himself; for the
chief may be so full of divine force that
it would be unsafe for an ordinary man
to be assimilated to him — a common
idea in primitive societies. See also
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 8, 13.</F>
<F>86) Fick, {%op. cit.,%} 24. Senart, {%op. cit.,%}

levsky, {%Famille et Propriété Primitives,%}
119; Fustel de Coulanges, {%op. cit.,%} 118,
119). But here again the system may
have applied to the Gotra without its
really explaining the later appearance
of the practice in the caste, and the
absence of the mention of a council in
the early and late literature alike is
conclusive against its existence.</F>

it can be interpreted to mean that the
