2. {@Varṇa@}¦ (lit. ‘colour’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> is applied to denote
<div n="lb"/>classes of men, the {@Dāsa@} and the Āryan Varṇa being contrasted,
<div n="lb"/>as other passages<sup>2</sup> show, on account of colour. But this use is
<div n="lb"/>confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Saṃhitās and
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> where the four castes ({%varṇāḥ%}) are already fully
<div n="lb"/>recognized.
<div n="P"/>{%(a) Caste in the Rigveda.%} — The use of the term Varṇa is not,
<div n="lb"/>of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have
<div n="lb"/>existed: the Puruṣa-sūkta, ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth
[Page2-248+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala<sup>4</sup> clearly contemplates the division of mankind into
<div n="lb"/>four classes — the Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. But
<div n="lb"/>the hymn being admittedly late,<sup>5</sup> its evidence is not cogent for
<div n="lb"/>the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer<sup>6</sup> has with great force com-
<div n="lb"/>batted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society
<div n="lb"/>that knew the caste system. He points out that the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas<sup>7</sup> show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrah-
<div n="lb"/>minized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region
<div n="lb"/>and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had
<div n="lb"/>wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the
<div n="lb"/>caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir,<sup>8</sup> derived
<div n="lb"/>from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that ({%a%}) the
<div n="lb"/>four castes appear only in the late Puruṣasūkta; ({%b%}) the term
<div n="lb"/>Varṇa, as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later
<div n="lb"/>times, and is only contrasted with Dāsa; ({%c%}) that Brāhmaṇa is
<div n="lb"/>rare in the Rigveda, Kṣatriya occurs seldom,<sup>9</sup> Rājanya only in
<div n="lb"/>the Puruṣasūkta, where too, alone, Vaiśya and Śūdra are
<div n="lb"/>found; ({%d%}) that Brahman denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and
<div n="lb"/>then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest;
<div n="lb"/>({%e%}) that in some only of the passages<sup>10</sup> where it occurs does
<div n="lb"/>Brahman denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it
<div n="lb"/>denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a
<div n="lb"/>person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to
<div n="lb"/>receive divine inspiration.<sup>11</sup> Brāhmaṇa, on the other hand, as
<div n="lb"/>Muir admits,<sup>12</sup> already denotes a hereditary professional priest-
<div n="lb"/>hood.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda to the elaborate system of the Yajurveda with the
[Page2-249+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Ger-
<div n="lb"/>manic invasions that transformed the German tribes into
<div n="lb"/>monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a
<div n="lb"/>conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink
<div n="lb"/>to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines
<div n="lb"/>or of other Āryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the
<div n="lb"/>subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the
<div n="lb"/>shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility
<div n="lb"/>of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers,
<div n="lb"/>as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon
<div n="lb"/>monarchies.<sup>13</sup> At the same time the people ceased to take
<div n="lb"/>part in military matters, and under climatic influences
<div n="lb"/>left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers,
<div n="lb"/>devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and
<div n="lb"/>trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the
<div n="lb"/>people was shared by them with the priesthood, the
<div n="lb"/>origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth
<div n="lb"/>first saw.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the
<div n="lb"/>people, but the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> itself shows cases, like those of
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvāmitra@} and {@Vasiṣṭha@} illustrating forcibly the power of the
<div n="lb"/>Purohita, though at the same time the right of the noble to act
<div n="lb"/>as Purohita is seen in the case of {@Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa.@}<sup>16</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of
<div n="lb"/>gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of
<div n="lb"/>the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many
<div n="lb"/>struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition.<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Atharvaveda<sup>18</sup> also preserves relics of these conflicts in its
<div n="lb"/>narration of the ruin of the {@Sṛñjayas@} because of oppressing
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viii-
<div n="lb"/>xii), the Śatarudriya litany of the Yajurveda<sup>19</sup> reflects the
<div n="lb"/>period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was
[Page2-250+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as
<div n="lb"/>the patron god of all sorts of evil doers.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>This version of the development of caste has received a good
<div n="lb"/>deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as the recognized version.<sup>21</sup> It has, however, always
<div n="lb"/>been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug,<sup>22</sup> Kern,<sup>23</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig,<sup>24</sup> and more recently by Oldenberg<sup>25</sup> and by Geldner.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing
<div n="lb"/>at once that the caste system is one that has progressively
<div n="lb"/>developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>the full caste system even of the Yajurveda; but at the same
<div n="lb"/>time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on
<div n="lb"/>its way to general acceptance. The argument from the non-
<div n="lb"/>brahminical character of the {@Vrātyas@} of the Indus and Panjab
<div n="lb"/>loses its force when it is remembered that there is much
<div n="lb"/>evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, especially the books<sup>27</sup> in which {@Sudās@} appears with
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in the east, the later {@Madhyadeśa,@} a
<div n="lb"/>view supported by Pischel,<sup>28</sup> Geldner,<sup>29</sup> Hopkins,<sup>30</sup> and Mac-
<div n="lb"/>donell.<sup>31</sup> Nor is it possible to maintain that Brahman in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by
<div n="lb"/>Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary pro-
<div n="lb"/>fession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs
<div n="lb"/>where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest
<div n="lb"/>was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda of the threefold<sup>32</sup> or fourfold<sup>33</sup> division of the people
[Page2-251+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>into {%brahma, kṣatram,%} and {%viśaḥ,%} or into the three classes and
<div n="lb"/>the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period,
<div n="lb"/>any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśyas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently<sup>34</sup>
<div n="lb"/>knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers,
<div n="lb"/>but the late Atharvaveda<sup>35</sup> equally classes the folk with the
<div n="lb"/>{%bala,%} ‘power,’ representing the Viś as associated with the {@Sabhā,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Samiti,@} and {@Senā,@} the assemblies of the people and the armed
<div n="lb"/>host. Zimmer<sup>36</sup> explains these references as due to tradition
<div n="lb"/>only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it
<div n="lb"/>does, on the false assumption that only a Kṣatriya can fight.
<div n="lb"/>But it is (see {@Kṣatriya@}) very doubtful whether Kṣatriya means
<div n="lb"/>anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in
<div n="lb"/>the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased
<div n="lb"/>in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though
<div n="lb"/>later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars,
<div n="lb"/>an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated
<div n="lb"/>as an absolute one. The Kṣatriyas were no doubt a hereditary
<div n="lb"/>body; monarchy was already hereditary (see {@Rājan@}), and it is
<div n="lb"/>admitted that the Śūdras were a separate body: thus all the
<div n="lb"/>elements of the caste system were already in existence. The
<div n="lb"/>Purohita, indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is
<div n="lb"/>clear, as Oldenberg<sup>37</sup> urges, that he was not the creator of the
<div n="lb"/>power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence
<div n="lb"/>he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary
<div n="lb"/>priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge.
<div n="P"/>Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste
<div n="lb"/>system be derived from cases like that of {@Devāpi.@} For, in the
<div n="lb"/>first place, the Upaniṣads show kings in the exercise of the
<div n="lb"/>priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upaniṣads
<div n="lb"/>are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system.
<div n="lb"/>In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi, who certainly acts as Purohita, is not stated in the
[Page2-252+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda to be a prince at all, though Yāska<sup>38</sup> calls him a
<div n="lb"/>Kauravya; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be
<div n="lb"/>vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again,
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇas do not scruple to recognize Rājanyarṣis, or
<div n="lb"/>‘royal sages’; and the famous Viśvāmitra shows in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>no sign of the royal character which the Brāhmaṇas insist
<div n="lb"/>on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of
<div n="lb"/>{@Jahnu.@}<sup>39</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%(b) Caste in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.%} — The relation
<div n="lb"/>between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history
<div n="lb"/>of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the
<div n="lb"/>hardening of a system already formed by the time of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>1. {%The Names of the Castes.%} — The most regular names are
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra,<sup>40</sup> or later Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra.<sup>41</sup> There are many other variants:
<div n="lb"/>Brahman, Kṣatra, Śūdrāryau;<sup>42</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Śūdra,
<div n="lb"/>Ārya;<sup>43</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Vaiśya, Śūdra;<sup>44</sup> Brāhmaṇa, Rājan,
<div n="lb"/>Viśya, Śūdra;<sup>45</sup> Deva, Rājan, Śūdra, Ārya;<sup>46</sup> and Brahman,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatra, Viś, and Śūdra.<sup>47</sup> In other cases the fourth class is repre-
<div n="lb"/>sented by a special member: Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and
<div n="lb"/>Cāṇḍāla.<sup>48</sup> Often only the three upper classes are mentioned,
<div n="lb"/>as Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya;<sup>49</sup> Brahman, Kṣatram, Viś,<sup>50</sup>
[Page2-253+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>etc.<sup>51</sup> Three castes — Brāhmaṇa, Rājan, Śūdra — are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda,<sup>52</sup> and two castes are repeatedly men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned together, either Brahman and Kṣatra, or Kṣatra and
<div n="lb"/>Viś.<sup>53</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%The Relation of the Castes.%} — The ritual literature is full of
<div n="lb"/>minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example,
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for
<div n="lb"/>the four castes,<sup>54</sup> Different modes of address are laid down for
<div n="lb"/>the four castes,<sup>55</sup> as {%ehi,%} ‘approach’; {%āgaccha,%} ‘come’; {%ādrava,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘run up’; {%ādhāva,%} ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of
<div n="lb"/>politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated
<div n="lb"/>at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities.<sup>56</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Sūtras have many similar rules.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly
<div n="lb"/>from the fourth, the Śūdras. The latter are in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>58</sup> declared not fit to be addressed by a Dīkṣita,
<div n="lb"/>‘consecrated person,’ and no Śūdra is to milk the cow whose
<div n="lb"/>milk is to be used for the Agnihotra<sup>59</sup> (‘fire-oblation’). On the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, in certain passages, the Śūdra is given a place in
<div n="lb"/>the Soma sacrifice,<sup>60</sup> and in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>61</sup> there
<div n="lb"/>are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only
<div n="lb"/>for the three upper castes, but also for the {@Rathakāra,@}
[Page2-254+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>62</sup> the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of
<div n="lb"/>the other three castes.
<div n="P"/>The characteristics of the several castes are given under
<div n="lb"/>{@Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya@} and {@Rājan, Vaiśya, Śūdra:@} they may be
<div n="lb"/>briefly summed up as follows: The Viś forms the basis of the
<div n="lb"/>state on which the Brahman and Kṣatra rest;<sup>63</sup> the Brahman
<div n="lb"/>and Kṣatra are superior to the Viś;<sup>64</sup> while all three classes are
<div n="lb"/>superior to the Śūdras. The real power of the state rested with
<div n="lb"/>the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be
<div n="lb"/>deemed the Kṣatriya element. Engaged in the business of the
<div n="lb"/>protection of the country, its administration, the decision of
<div n="lb"/>legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the
<div n="lb"/>revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to
<div n="lb"/>them villages (see {@Grāma@}) for their maintenance, while some of
<div n="lb"/>them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by
<div n="lb"/>slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small:<sup>65</sup> there
<div n="lb"/>are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the
<div n="lb"/>mention of {@Mahārājas.@} The people, engaged in agriculture,
<div n="lb"/>pastoral pursuits, and trade ({@Vaṇij@}), paid tribute to the king
<div n="lb"/>and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as Baden-
<div n="lb"/>Powell suggests,<sup>66</sup> they were not themselves agriculturists is
<div n="lb"/>probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large
<div n="lb"/>scale, and draw their revenues from Śūdra tenants, or even
<div n="lb"/>Āryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this
[Page2-255+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>position is extremely unlikely.<sup>67</sup> In war the people shared
<div n="lb"/>the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute
<div n="lb"/>separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests
<div n="lb"/>may be divided into two classes — the Purohitas of the kings,
<div n="lb"/>who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a
<div n="lb"/>position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident
<div n="lb"/>they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives,
<div n="lb"/>except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king
<div n="lb"/>or a wealthy noble.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up
<div n="lb"/>in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>69</sup> which treats of them
<div n="lb"/>as opposed to the Kṣatriya. The Brāhmaṇa is a receiver of
<div n="lb"/>gifts ({%ā-dāyī%}), a drinker of Soma ({%ā-pāyī%}), a seeker of food
<div n="lb"/>({%āvasāyī%}),<sup>70</sup> and liable to removal at will ({%yathākāma-prayāpyaḥ%}).<sup>71</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Vaiśya is tributary to another ({%anyasya balikṛt%}), to be lived
<div n="lb"/>on by another ({%anyasyādyaḥ%}), and to be oppressed at will ({%yathā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kāma-jyeyaḥ%}).<sup>72</sup> The Śūdra is the servant of another ({%anyasya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%preṣyaḥ%}), to be expelled at will ({%kāmotthāpyaḥ%}), and to be slain
[Page2-256+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>at pleasure ({%yathākāma-vadhyaḥ%}).<sup>73</sup> The descriptions seem
<div n="lb"/>calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the
<div n="lb"/>Rājanya. Even the Brāhmaṇa he can control, whilst the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove
<div n="lb"/>without cause from his land,<sup>74</sup> but who is still free, and whom
<div n="lb"/>he cannot maim or slay without due process. The Śūdra has
<div n="lb"/>no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the
<div n="lb"/>king.
<div n="P"/>The passage is a late one, and the high place of the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in
<div n="lb"/>the course of time the Vaiśya fell more and more in position
<div n="lb"/>with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber<sup>75</sup> shows
<div n="lb"/>reason for believing that the Vājapeya sacrifice, a festival of
<div n="lb"/>which a chariot race forms an integral part,<sup>76</sup> was, as the
<div n="lb"/>Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>77</sup> says, once a sacrifice for a Vaiśya,
<div n="lb"/>as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer
<div n="lb"/>diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya texts<sup>78</sup> show that the Vājapeya was originally a lesser
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya, or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings,
<div n="lb"/>and in that of the Brahmin by the Bṛhaspatisava, a festival
<div n="lb"/>celebrated on his appointment as a royal Purohita. But the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>79</sup> exalts the Vājapeya, in which a priest
<div n="lb"/>could be the sacrificer, over the Rājasūya, from which he was
<div n="lb"/>excluded, and identifies it with the Bṛhaspatisava, a clear piece
<div n="lb"/>of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we
<div n="lb"/>must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the
<div n="lb"/>exaltation of the Purohita in the later books of the Śatapatha
[Page2-257+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>and Aitareya Brāhmaṇas as evidence of a real growth in the
<div n="lb"/>priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests
<div n="lb"/>of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in
<div n="lb"/>the Madhyadeśa. Another side of the picture is presented in
<div n="lb"/>the Pāli literature,<sup>80</sup> which, belonging to a later period than the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests;
<div n="lb"/>while the Epic,<sup>81</sup> more nearly contemporaneous with the later
<div n="lb"/>Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal
<div n="lb"/>superiority of the nobility in clear light.
<div n="P"/>Although clear distinctions were made between the different
<div n="lb"/>castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the
<div n="lb"/>leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity com-
<div n="lb"/>municated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes,<sup>82</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which is seen both directly in the purification rendered
<div n="lb"/>necessary in case of contact with a Śūdra, and indirectly in the
<div n="lb"/>prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste.<sup>83</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does
<div n="lb"/>appear,<sup>84</sup> but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to
<div n="lb"/>preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain
<div n="lb"/>rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the
<div n="lb"/>same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire
<div n="lb"/>the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental com-
<div n="lb"/>munion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to
<div n="lb"/>take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying
[Page2-258+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>purity.<sup>85</sup> Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the
<div n="lb"/>constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals
<div n="lb"/>which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not
<div n="lb"/>found even in the Epic or in the Pāli literature.<sup>86</sup> The Vedic
<div n="lb"/>characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common
<div n="lb"/>occupation, and restriction on intermarriage.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Restrictions on Intermarriage.%} — Arrian, in his {%Indica,%}<sup>87</sup>
<div n="lb"/>probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of marriage between <lang n="greek">γένη</lang>, no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic
<div n="lb"/>of Indian life. The evidence of Pāli literature<sup>88</sup> is in favour of
<div n="lb"/>this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he
<div n="lb"/>wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir apparent.
<div n="lb"/>But it equally shows that there were others who held that not
<div n="lb"/>the father's but the mother's rank determined the social
<div n="lb"/>standing of the son. Though Manu<sup>89</sup> recognizes the possibility
<div n="lb"/>of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate
<div n="lb"/>children, still he condemns the marriage of an Āryan with
<div n="lb"/>a woman of lower caste. The Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>90</sup> allows
<div n="lb"/>the marriage of a Kṣatriya with a wife of his own caste or of
<div n="lb"/>the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or
<div n="lb"/>of the two lower classes, and of a Vaiśya with a Vaiśya wife
<div n="lb"/>only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can
<div n="lb"/>marry a Śūdra wife, while other authorities condemn the
<div n="lb"/>marriage with a Śūdra wife in certain circumstances, which
<div n="lb"/>implies that in other cases it might be justified.<sup>91</sup> The earlier
[Page2-259+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on
<div n="lb"/>descent from a Ṛṣi, and on purity of descent;<sup>92</sup> but there is
<div n="lb"/>other evidence for the view that even a Brāhmaṇa need not be
<div n="lb"/>of pure lineage. {@Kavaṣa@} Ailūṣa is taunted with being the son
<div n="lb"/>of a Dāsī, ‘slave woman,’<sup>93</sup> and {@Vatsa@} was accused of being a
<div n="lb"/>Śūdrā's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt
<div n="lb"/>through the flames of a fire ordeal.<sup>94</sup> He who is learned
<div n="lb"/>({%śuśruvān%}) is said to be a Brāhmaṇa, descended from a Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>({%ārṣeya%}), in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>95</sup> and {@Satyakāma,@} son of
<div n="lb"/>{@Jabālā,@} was accepted as a pupil by {@Hāridrumata@} Gautama,
<div n="lb"/>though he could not name his father.<sup>96</sup> The Kāṭhaka Saṃ-
<div n="lb"/>hitā<sup>97</sup> says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But
<div n="lb"/>all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity
<div n="lb"/>in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based
<div n="lb"/>on heredity. The Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>98</sup> recognize the illicit
<div n="lb"/>union of Ārya and Śūdrā, and {%vice versa:%} it is not unlikely that
<div n="lb"/>if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible.
<div n="lb"/>The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>99</sup> indeed, recognizes such a case in
<div n="lb"/>that of {@Dīrghatamas,@} son of the slave girl Uśij, if we may
<div n="lb"/>adopt the description of Uśij given in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>In a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>101</sup> extreme claims are put
[Page2-260+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>forward for the Brāhmaṇa, who alone is a true husband and
<div n="lb"/>the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a Rājanya
<div n="lb"/>or a Vaiśya: a Śūdra husband is not mentioned, probably on
<div n="lb"/>purpose.<sup>102</sup> The marriage of Brāhmaṇas with Rājanya women
<div n="lb"/>is illustrated by the cases of {@Sukanyā,@} daughter of king
<div n="lb"/>{@Śaryāta,@} who married {@Cyavana,@}<sup>103</sup> and of {@Rathavīti's@} daughter,
<div n="lb"/>who married {@Śyāvāśva.@}<sup>104</sup>
<div n="P"/>4. {%Occupation and Caste.%} — The Greek authorities<sup>105</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>evidence of the Jātakas<sup>106</sup> concur in showing it to have been
<div n="lb"/>the general rule that each caste was confined to its own
<div n="lb"/>occupations, but that the Brāhmaṇas did engage in many
<div n="lb"/>professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave
<div n="lb"/>members to the Śramaṇas, or homeless ascetics. The Jātakas<sup>107</sup>
<div n="lb"/>recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations,
<div n="lb"/>as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are
<div n="lb"/>somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>and Kṣatriyas appear as practically confined to their own pro-
<div n="lb"/>fessions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions.
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>108</sup> sees in {@Dīrghaśravas@} in the Rigveda<sup>109</sup> a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even
<div n="lb"/>later by the Sūtra literature; but this is not certain, though it
<div n="lb"/>is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far
<div n="lb"/>the Kṣatriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here
<div n="lb"/>is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvāmitra.@} In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest
<div n="lb"/>who is attached to the court of {@Sudās,@} king of the {@Tṛtsus;@} but
<div n="lb"/>in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>110</sup> he is called a king, a descendant
<div n="lb"/>of {@Jahnu,@} and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>111</sup> refers to {@Śunaḥśepa's@}
[Page2-261+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>succeeding, through his adoption by Viśvāmitra, to the divine
<div n="lb"/>lore ({%daiva veda%}) of the {@Gāthins@} and the lordship of the Jahnus.
<div n="lb"/>That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable,
<div n="lb"/>but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal
<div n="lb"/>origin. Such figures appear more than once in the Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> which knows the technical terms {@Rājanyarṣi@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Devarājan@} corresponding to the later Rājarṣi, ‘royal sage.’ The
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>113</sup> says of one who knows a certain
<div n="lb"/>doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ ({%rājā sann ṛṣir%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhavati%}), and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>114</sup> applies the
<div n="lb"/>term Rājanya to a Brāhmaṇa. Again, it is argued that {@Devāpi@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Ārṣṭiṣeṇa,@} who acted as Purohita, according to the Rigveda,<sup>115</sup>
<div n="lb"/>for {@Śantanu,@} was a prince, as Yāska<sup>116</sup> says or implies he
<div n="lb"/>was.<sup>117</sup> But this assumption seems to be only an error of
<div n="lb"/>Yāska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relation-
<div n="lb"/>ship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view<sup>118</sup> that the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince
<div n="lb"/>acting the part of Purohita as unusual and requiring explanation.
<div n="lb"/>The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir<sup>119</sup> has argued
<div n="lb"/>that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sāyaṇa,<sup>120</sup> regards many
<div n="lb"/>hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he
<div n="lb"/>admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be
<div n="lb"/>added that in the case of {@Pṛthī Vainya,@} where the hymn<sup>121</sup>
<div n="lb"/>ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn
<div n="lb"/>itself that he is other than a seer; the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup>
<div n="lb"/>calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than
<div n="lb"/>the later tradition as to Viśvāmitra. The case of {@Viśvantara@}
[Page2-262+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>and the {@Śyāparṇas@} mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>123</sup> has
<div n="lb"/>been cited<sup>124</sup> as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid,
<div n="lb"/>but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Kaśyapas, Asitamṛgas,@} and {@Bhūtavīras@} mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king
<div n="lb"/>had other priests to carry out the sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal
<div n="lb"/>persons. Thus {@Janaka@} is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>125</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to have become a Brahman; {@Ajātaśatru@} taught {@Gārgya@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Bālāki;@}<sup>126</sup> {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali@} instructed {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@}<sup>127</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as well as {@Śilaka Śālāvatya@}<sup>128</sup> and {@Caikitāyana Dālbhya;@}
<div n="lb"/>and {@Aśvapati Kaikeya@} taught Brahmins.<sup>129</sup> It has been
<div n="lb"/>deduced<sup>130</sup> from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a
<div n="lb"/>product of the Kṣatriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely
<div n="lb"/>doubtful,<sup>131</sup> for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by
<div n="lb"/>the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere<sup>132</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the opinion of a Rājanya is treated with contempt.
<div n="P"/>It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not
<div n="lb"/>much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though
<div n="lb"/>it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But
<div n="lb"/>that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste
<div n="lb"/>took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example.
<div n="lb"/>That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have
<div n="lb"/>taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick<sup>133</sup>
<div n="lb"/>points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the
<div n="lb"/>later period at least, become a Śramaṇa, as is recorded in effect
[Page2-263+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>of many kings in the Epic.<sup>134</sup> Whether the practice is Vedic is
<div n="lb"/>not clear: Yāska<sup>135</sup> records it of Devāpi, but this is not evidence
<div n="lb"/>for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas,
<div n="lb"/>accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the
<div n="lb"/>mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight,<sup>136</sup> as Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>and Viśvāmitra seem to have done, and as priests do even in
<div n="lb"/>the Epic from time to time.<sup>137</sup> But a priest cannot be said to
<div n="lb"/>change caste by acting in this way.
<div n="P"/>More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of
<div n="lb"/>caste may be seen in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>138</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>{@Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana@} is represented as speaking of his off-
<div n="lb"/>spring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and
<div n="lb"/>commons of the Śalvas; and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>139</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where Viśvantara is told that if the wrong offering were made
<div n="lb"/>his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda<sup>140</sup> talks as if he could be converted into a king.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, certain kings, such as {@Para Āṭṇāra,@} are
<div n="lb"/>spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’<sup>141</sup> As
<div n="lb"/>evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin might become a king, while the Ṛṣi in the Rigveda is
<div n="lb"/>represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great
<div n="lb"/>kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were
<div n="lb"/>consecrated ({%dīkṣita%}), and so temporarily became Brahmins.<sup>142</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would
<div n="lb"/>be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is
<div n="lb"/>not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of
<div n="lb"/>Satyakāma Jābāla do not go far; for {%ex hypothesi%} that teacher
[Page2-264+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite
<div n="lb"/>well have been a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles
<div n="lb"/>practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a
<div n="lb"/>closed body into which a man must be born. These two
<div n="lb"/>Varṇas may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vaiśyas
<div n="lb"/>offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of
<div n="lb"/>occupations (see {@Vaiśya@}). Fick<sup>143</sup> concludes that there is no
<div n="lb"/>exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the
<div n="lb"/>Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups,
<div n="lb"/>which themselves practised endogamy such as the {%gahapatis,%} or
<div n="lb"/>smaller landowners, the {%setthis,%} or large merchants and members
<div n="lb"/>of the various guilds, while there are clear traces<sup>144</sup> in the legal
<div n="lb"/>textbooks of a view that Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya stand opposed
<div n="lb"/>to all the other members of the community. But we need
<div n="lb"/>hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the Vaiśya, the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all
<div n="lb"/>probability, which was severed by its free status from the
<div n="lb"/>Śūdras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble
<div n="lb"/>blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably
<div n="lb"/>legitimate to hold that any Vaiśya could marry any member of
<div n="lb"/>the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśyas are growths of divisions parallel with the original
<div n="lb"/>process by which priest and noble had grown into separate
<div n="lb"/>entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall
<div n="lb"/>under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the
<div n="lb"/>social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on
<div n="lb"/>equal terms — hypergamy is often allowed — and so those Vaiśyas
<div n="lb"/>who acquired wealth in trade ({@Śreṣṭhin@}) or agriculture (the
<div n="lb"/>Pāli Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary Vaiśyas. But it is not legitimate to regard Vaiśya as
<div n="lb"/>a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process
<div n="lb"/>of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of
<div n="lb"/>occupation, religion, or geographical situation.
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>145</sup> denies also that the Śūdras ever formed a single
[Page2-265+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior
<div n="lb"/>races and tribes defeated by the Āryan invaders, but originally
<div n="lb"/>as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose
<div n="lb"/>that Śūdra was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the
<div n="lb"/>nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside
<div n="lb"/>the three castes — nobles, priests, and people — just as in the
<div n="lb"/>Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests,
<div n="lb"/>the {%nobiles%} or eorls, and the {%ingenui,%} ordinary freemen or ceorls,
<div n="lb"/>there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic
<div n="lb"/>expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see
<div n="lb"/>{@Śūdra@}). In the Āryan view a marriage of Śūdras could hardly
<div n="lb"/>be regulated by rules; any Śūdra could wed another, if such a
<div n="lb"/>marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in
<div n="lb"/>early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But
<div n="lb"/>what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less
<div n="lb"/>and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and
<div n="lb"/>princes must have come into the Āryan community by peaceful
<div n="lb"/>means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and
<div n="lb"/>when the term Śūdra would cover many sorts of people who
<div n="lb"/>were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character
<div n="lb"/>occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of
<div n="lb"/>the village, like the {@Caṇḍālas,@} or tribes living under Āryan
<div n="lb"/>control, or independent, such as the {@Niṣādas.@}
<div n="P"/>But it is also probable that the Śūdras came to include men
<div n="lb"/>of Āryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation
<div n="lb"/>of Āryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to
<div n="lb"/>have been the case with the {@Rathakāras.@} In the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>146</sup> the Rathakāra is placed as a special class along
<div n="lb"/>with the Brāhmaṇas, Rājanyas, and Vaiśyas: this can hardly
<div n="lb"/>be interpreted except to mean that the Rathakāras were not
<div n="lb"/>included in the Āryan classes, though it is just possible that
<div n="lb"/>only a subdivision of the Vaiśyas is meant. There is other
<div n="lb"/>evidence<sup>147</sup> that the Rathakāras were regarded as Śūdras. But
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda<sup>148</sup> the Rathakāras and the {@Karmāras@}
<div n="lb"/>appear in a position of importance in connexion with the
[Page2-266+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in
<div n="lb"/>an honourable way in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā;<sup>149</sup> in the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>150</sup> too, the Rathakāra is mentioned as a
<div n="lb"/>a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view
<div n="lb"/>suggested by Fick<sup>151</sup> that these classes were originally non-
<div n="lb"/>Āryan; we must recognize that the Rathakāras, in early Vedic
<div n="lb"/>times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of
<div n="lb"/>the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified.
<div n="lb"/>The development of this idea was a departure from the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has
<div n="lb"/>a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe.
<div n="lb"/>Similarly, the Karmāra, the {@Takṣan,@}<sup>152</sup> the Carmamna, or
<div n="lb"/>‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupa-
<div n="lb"/>tions in the Rigveda, are reckoned as Śūdras in the Pāli
<div n="lb"/>texts.<sup>153</sup>
<div n="P"/>The later theory, which appears fully developed in the
<div n="lb"/>Dharma Sūtras,<sup>154</sup> deduces the several castes other than the
<div n="lb"/>original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This
<div n="lb"/>theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In
<div n="lb"/>some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the {@Sūta@} is said
<div n="lb"/>to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if
<div n="lb"/>the Sūtas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to
<div n="lb"/>occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Sūtas,
<div n="lb"/>Grāmaṇīs, and other members of occupations were real castes
<div n="lb"/>in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic
<div n="lb"/>period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress
<div n="lb"/>by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an
<div n="lb"/>important determining feature, just as in modern times there
<div n="lb"/>are castes bearing names like Gopāla (‘cowherd’) Kaivarta or
<div n="lb"/>Dhīvara (‘fisherman’), and Vaṇij (‘merchant’).<sup>155</sup>
[Page2-267+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>156</sup> finds in the Jātakas mention of a number of occupa-
<div n="lb"/>tions whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such
<div n="lb"/>as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who
<div n="lb"/>went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in
<div n="lb"/>the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times
<div n="lb"/>these people presumably fell under the conception of Śūdra,
<div n="lb"/>and may have included the {@Parṇaka, Paulkasa, Bainda,@} who
<div n="lb"/>are mentioned with many others in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
<div n="lb"/>and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa in the list of victims at the
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom
<div n="lb"/>Fick<sup>157</sup> includes in the same category, were certainly included
<div n="lb"/>in the term Śūdra.
<div n="P"/>5. {%Origin of the Castes.%} — The question of the origin of the
<div n="lb"/>castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the
<div n="lb"/>extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with
<div n="lb"/>the features of any other Āryan society, must probably be
<div n="lb"/>sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning
<div n="lb"/>between the Āryan and the Śūdra. The contrast which the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the
<div n="lb"/>conquered population, and which probably rested originally on
<div n="lb"/>the difference of colour between the upper and the lower
<div n="lb"/>classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth,
<div n="lb"/>occupation, and locality which normally existed among the
<div n="lb"/>Āryan Indians, but which among other Āryan peoples never
<div n="lb"/>developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine
<div n="lb"/>of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste
<div n="lb"/>system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>could marry the Śūdrā, but not the Śūdra the Āryā. This
<div n="lb"/>distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its
<div n="lb"/>force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to
<div n="lb"/>mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of
<div n="lb"/>America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between
<div n="lb"/>the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population
<div n="lb"/>which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons
<div n="lb"/>of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but
<div n="lb"/>varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of
<div n="lb"/>a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race;
[Page2-268+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>(2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage
<div n="lb"/>between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark
<div n="lb"/>race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each
<div n="lb"/>category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation
<div n="lb"/>than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is
<div n="lb"/>what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears,
<div n="lb"/>then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best repre-
<div n="lb"/>sented by Risley,<sup>158</sup> which explains caste in the main as a
<div n="lb"/>matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is,
<div n="lb"/>the greater is the proportion of Āryan blood.
<div n="P"/>The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart,<sup>159</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which places the greatest stress on the Āryan constitution of
<div n="lb"/>the family. According to Senart the Āryan people practised in
<div n="lb"/>affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy.
<div n="lb"/>A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the
<div n="lb"/>same {%gens,%} according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart
<div n="lb"/>and Kovalevsky;<sup>160</sup> and an Athenian must marry an Athenian
<div n="lb"/>woman, but not one of the same <lang n="greek">γένος</lang>. In India these rules
<div n="lb"/>are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within
<div n="lb"/>the {@Gotra,@} but not without the caste. The theory, though
<div n="lb"/>attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek
<div n="lb"/>parallels are not even probably accurate;<sup>161</sup> and in India the
<div n="lb"/>rule forbidding marriage within the Gotra is one which grows;
<div n="lb"/>in strictness as the evidence grows later in date.<sup>162</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the
<div n="lb"/>development of caste may have been helped by the family
<div n="lb"/>traditions of some {%gentes,%} or <lang n="greek">γένη</lang>, or Gotras. The Patricians
<div n="lb"/>of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the
<div n="lb"/>plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their
<lang n="greek">γένη</lang> pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and
<div n="lb"/>there may well have been noble families among the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The
[Page2-269+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>Germans known to Tacitus<sup>163</sup> were divided into {%nobiles%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%ingenui,%} and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble
<div n="lb"/>and non-noble freemen.<sup>164</sup> The origin of nobility need not be
<div n="lb"/>sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have
<div n="lb"/>existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom
<div n="lb"/>we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king
<div n="lb"/>often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of,
<div n="lb"/>the deity;<sup>165</sup> and that hereditary kingship would tend to
<div n="lb"/>increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the
<div n="lb"/>royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain
<div n="lb"/>the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the
<div n="lb"/>king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in
<div n="lb"/>the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar
<div n="lb"/>exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences
<div n="lb"/>that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep
<div n="lb"/>opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines.
<div n="P"/>Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions.
<div n="lb"/>Nesfield<sup>166</sup> was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of
<div n="lb"/>caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view
<div n="lb"/>considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly
<div n="lb"/>certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The
<div n="lb"/>carpenters ({@Takṣan@}), the chariot-makers ({@Rathakāra@}), the fisher-
<div n="lb"/>men ({@Dhaivara@}) and others are clearly of the type of caste, and
<div n="lb"/>the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to
<div n="lb"/>say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its
<div n="lb"/>first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have
<div n="lb"/>produced the system of caste without the interposition of the
<div n="lb"/>fundamental difference between Āryan and Dāsa or Śūdra
<div n="lb"/>blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant what the history of the Āryan peoples shows us to be
<div n="lb"/>declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble
[Page2-270+ 77]
<div n="lb"/>freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which
<div n="lb"/>seems to have been developed in the Āryan people before the
<div n="lb"/>separation of its various branches.
<div n="P"/>It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division
<div n="lb"/>of classes comparable in some respects<sup>167</sup> with the Indian
<div n="lb"/>polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are
<div n="lb"/>unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to
<div n="lb"/>correspond closely to the Pāli Gahapatis, and perhaps to the
<div n="lb"/>Śūdras.<sup>168</sup> But they are certainly not castes in the Indian
<div n="lb"/>sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of
<div n="lb"/>Senart<sup>169</sup> or of Risley<sup>170</sup> that the names of the old classes were
<div n="lb"/>later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were
<div n="lb"/>different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes
<div n="lb"/>existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed
<div n="lb"/>by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa evidence for the four Varṇas, and treating the
<div n="lb"/>transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes
<div n="lb"/>and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no
<div n="lb"/>Varṇa, caste might never have arisen; both colour and class
<div n="lb"/>occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste.<sup>171</sup>

<div n="lb"/>222. The point is much the same as that
<div n="lb"/>at issue between the different schools of
<div n="lb"/>opinion as to early English history.
<div n="lb"/>Did the Āryans in India occupy the
<div n="lb"/>land as a people, driving out or ex-
<div n="lb"/>terminating or enslaving the Dāsas,
<div n="lb"/>and themselves carrying on the occupa-
<div n="lb"/>tions of a people, or did they merely
<div n="lb"/>form a small aristocracy of superior
<div n="lb"/>military force, and were the Kṣatriyas
<div n="lb"/>the true Āryans? The evidence of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda is really fatal to the latter
<div n="lb"/>alternative hypothesis.</F>

<div n="lb"/>vii. 15, 8; viii. 9, 6; Śāṅkhāyana
<div n="lb"/>Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 20, 12. The Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa is, in his turn, dependent on the
<div n="lb"/>king (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 3;
<div n="lb"/>v. 4, 2, 7), and at the Rājasūya sits
<div n="lb"/>beside him, but is none the less superior
<div n="lb"/>(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 23).
<div n="lb"/>The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5, says
<div n="lb"/>the Kṣatra is over the Brahman, but
<div n="lb"/>this is not a usual view. {%Cf.%} xxvii. 4.
<div n="lb"/>A Brāhmaṇa can get along without a

<div n="lb"/>with a Brāhmaṇa surpasses all other
<div n="lb"/>Rājanyas (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1,

<div n="lb"/>If we have no evidence exactly estab-

<div n="lb"/>there is that eating the food of a chief
<div n="lb"/>is dangerous, since the eater thus enters
<div n="lb"/>into possession of part of his sub-
<div n="lb"/>stance, and consequently at once be-
<div n="lb"/>comes an object of anger to the chief,
<div n="lb"/>as well as of danger to himself; for the
<div n="lb"/>chief may be so full of divine force that
<div n="lb"/>it would be unsafe for an ordinary man
<div n="lb"/>to be assimilated to him — a common
