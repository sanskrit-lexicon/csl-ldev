{@Sabhā@}¦ is the name of an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic Indians as
<div n="lb"/>well as of the ‘hall’ where they met in assembly. It is often
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> but its exact character is
<div n="lb"/>not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing,<sup>3</sup> presumably
<div n="lb"/>when the assembly was not transacting public business: a
<div n="lb"/>dicer is called {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%} ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubt-
<div n="lb"/>less because of his constant presence there.<sup>4</sup> The hall also
<div n="lb"/>served, like the Homeric <lang n="greek">λέσχη</lang>, as a meeting-place for social
<div n="lb"/>intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth,<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>possibly for debates and verbal contests.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Ludwig,<sup>7</sup> the Sabhā was an assembly not of all
<div n="lb"/>the people, but of the Brahmins and {@Maghavans@} (‘rich
<div n="lb"/>patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions
[Page2-427+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>{%sabheya,%} ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin,<sup>8</sup> {%rayiḥ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%sabhāvān,%} ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’<sup>9</sup> and so on. But
<div n="lb"/>Bloomfield<sup>10</sup> plausibly sees in these passages a domestic use of
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā, which is recognized by the St. Petersburg Dictionary
<div n="lb"/>in several passages<sup>11</sup> as relating to a house, not to the assembly
<div n="lb"/>at all. Zimmer<sup>12</sup> is satisfied that the Sabhā was the meeting-
<div n="lb"/>place of the village council, presided over by the {@Grāmaṇī.@}
<div n="lb"/>But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> seems
<div n="lb"/>right in maintaining that the Sabhā and the {@Samiti@} cannot be
<div n="lb"/>distinguished, and that the reference to well-born ({%su-jāta%})<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>men being there in session is to the Āryan as opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>Dāsa or Śūdra, not to one class of Āryan as opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>other. Hillebrandt also sees in Agni ‘of the hall’ ({%sabhya%}) a
<div n="lb"/>trace of the fire used in sacrifice on behalf of the assembly
<div n="lb"/>when it met.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>Women did not go to the Sabhā,<sup>16</sup> for they were, of course,
<div n="lb"/>excluded from political activity. For the Sabhā as a court-
<div n="lb"/>house, {%cf.%} {@Grāmyavādin.@} There is not a single notice of the
<div n="lb"/>work done by the Sabhā.

<div n="lb"/>Sāyaṇa's note. Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Leben,%} 172, inclines to see in the formula
<div n="lb"/>(Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; xx. 17;
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 3, 1; Kāṭhaka

<div n="lb"/>i. 10, 2) ‘what sin we have committed
<div n="lb"/>in the village, the jungle, the Sabhā’
<div n="lb"/>a reference to attacks on the great
<div n="lb"/>(Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
<div n="lb"/>iii. 45), or partiality in deciding dis-
<div n="lb"/>putes (Mahīdhara, {%ibid.,%} xx. 17). But
<div n="lb"/>it may refer to gambling or other non-
<div n="lb"/>political activity, as Eggeling, {%Sacred%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Books of the East,%} 12, 398, takes it,
<div n="lb"/>though he renders it differently, {%ibid.,%}
<div n="lb"/>44, 265.</F>
<F>5) Rv. vi. 28, 6. {%Cf.%} viii. 4, 9. So
<div n="lb"/>in Av. vii. 12, 2, the assembly is hailed
<div n="lb"/>as {%nariṣṭā,%} ‘merriment.’ But the same
<div n="lb"/>hymn (vii. 12, 3) contains a clear refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence to serious speech in the Sabhā.
<div n="lb"/>For the blending of serious political
<div n="lb"/>work and amusement, {%cf.%} Tacitus,

<div n="lb"/>viii. 4, 9; x. 71, 10 (passages which
<div n="lb"/>are quite vague). {%Cf.%} also Rv. vii. 1, 4;

<div n="lb"/>etc. Max Müller, {%Sacred Books of the%}
<div n="lb"/>{%East,%} 32, 276, sees in {%sabheya%} the im-
<div n="lb"/>plication of ‘courtly manners,’ but this
<div n="lb"/>is rather doubtful; manner is not con-
<div n="lb"/>spicuous in Vedic society as in Homeric.</F>
<F>9) Rv. iv. 2, 5; in i. 167, 3, {%sabhāvatī%}
<div n="lb"/>is applied to ‘speech,’ or perhaps to
<div n="lb"/>{%yoṣā,%} ‘woman.’</F>

<F>11) Av. viii. 10, 5 (where the sense
<div n="lb"/>is, however, clearly ‘assembly’; see
<div n="lb"/>viii. 10, 6); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4,
<div n="lb"/>8, 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 3;
<div n="lb"/>Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 14 (but here
<div n="lb"/>the sense is certainly ‘assembly hall,’;
<div n="lb"/>see v. 3, 6, where the king is described
<div n="lb"/>as going to the assembly hall: {%sabhā-ga%})
<div n="lb"/>The exact sense given by the St. Peters-
<div n="lb"/>burg Dictionary is the ‘society room’
<div n="lb"/>in a dwelling-house.</F>
<F>12) {%Altindisches Leben,%} 174. But he
<div n="lb"/>ignores Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4,
<div n="lb"/>14; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 6,
<div n="lb"/>which show that the king went to the
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā just as much as to the Samiti,
<div n="lb"/>and he cannot adduce any passage to
<div n="lb"/>show that the Grāmaṇī presided.</F>
