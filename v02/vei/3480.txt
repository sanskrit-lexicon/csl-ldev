{@Sabhā@}¦ is the name of an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic Indians as
well as of the ‘hall’ where they met in assembly. It is often
mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> but its exact character is
not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing,<sup>3</sup> presumably
when the assembly was not transacting public business: a
dicer is called {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%} ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubt-
less because of his constant presence there.<sup>4</sup> The hall also
served, like the Homeric <lang n="greek">λέσχη</lang>, as a meeting-place for social
intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth,<sup>5</sup>
possibly for debates and verbal contests.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Ludwig,<sup>7</sup> the Sabhā was an assembly not of all
the people, but of the Brahmins and {@Maghavans@} (‘rich
patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions
[Page2-427+ 62]
{%sabheya,%} ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin,<sup>8</sup> {%rayiḥ%}
{%sabhāvān,%} ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’<sup>9</sup> and so on. But
Bloomfield<sup>10</sup> plausibly sees in these passages a domestic use of
Sabhā, which is recognized by the St. Petersburg Dictionary
in several passages<sup>11</sup> as relating to a house, not to the assembly
at all. Zimmer<sup>12</sup> is satisfied that the Sabhā was the meeting-
place of the village council, presided over by the {@Grāmaṇī.@}
But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> seems
right in maintaining that the Sabhā and the {@Samiti@} cannot be
distinguished, and that the reference to well-born ({%su-jāta%})<sup>14</sup>
men being there in session is to the Āryan as opposed to the
Dāsa or Śūdra, not to one class of Āryan as opposed to the
other. Hillebrandt also sees in Agni ‘of the hall’ ({%sabhya%}) a
trace of the fire used in sacrifice on behalf of the assembly
when it met.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>Women did not go to the Sabhā,<sup>16</sup> for they were, of course,
excluded from political activity. For the Sabhā as a court-
house, {%cf.%} {@Grāmyavādin.@} There is not a single notice of the
work done by the Sabhā.

(here {%dyūta%} is used in place of Sabhā).</F>
<F>4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18; Tait-
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1, with
Sāyaṇa's note. Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}
{%Leben,%} 172, inclines to see in the formula
(Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; xx. 17;
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 3, 1; Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā, ix. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,
i. 10, 2) ‘what sin we have committed
in the village, the jungle, the Sabhā’
a reference to attacks on the great
(Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
iii. 45), or partiality in deciding dis-
putes (Mahīdhara, {%ibid.,%} xx. 17). But
it may refer to gambling or other non-
political activity, as Eggeling, {%Sacred%}
{%Books of the East,%} 12, 398, takes it,
though he renders it differently, {%ibid.,%}
44, 265.</F>
<F>5) Rv. vi. 28, 6. {%Cf.%} viii. 4, 9. So
in Av. vii. 12, 2, the assembly is hailed
as {%nariṣṭā,%} ‘merriment.’ But the same
hymn (vii. 12, 3) contains a clear refer-
ence to serious speech in the Sabhā.
For the blending of serious political
work and amusement, {%cf.%} Tacitus,
{%Germania,%} 22.</F>
<F>6) So Zimmer, {%op. cit.,%} 174, takes
{%sabheya%} in Rv. ii. 24, 13.</F>
<F>7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 253-
256. He quotes for this view Rv.
viii. 4, 9; x. 71, 10 (passages which
are quite vague). {%Cf.%} also Rv. vii. 1, 4;
Av. xix. 57, 2.</F>
<F>8) Rv. ii. 24, 13. {%Cf.%} i. 91, 20; Av.
xx. 128, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 22,
etc. Max Müller, {%Sacred Books of the%}
{%East,%} 32, 276, sees in {%sabheya%} the im-
plication of ‘courtly manners,’ but this
is rather doubtful; manner is not con-
spicuous in Vedic society as in Homeric.</F>
<F>9) Rv. iv. 2, 5; in i. 167, 3, {%sabhāvatī%}
is applied to ‘speech,’ or perhaps to
{%yoṣā,%} ‘woman.’</F>
<F>10) {%Journal of the American Oriental%}
{%Society,%} 19, 13.</F>
<F>11) Av. viii. 10, 5 (where the sense
is, however, clearly ‘assembly’; see
viii. 10, 6); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4,
8, 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 3;
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 14 (but here
the sense is certainly ‘assembly hall,’;
see v. 3, 6, where the king is described
as going to the assembly hall: {%sabhā-ga%})
The exact sense given by the St. Peters-
burg Dictionary is the ‘society room’
in a dwelling-house.</F>
<F>12) {%Altindisches Leben,%} 174. But he
ignores Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4,
14; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 6,
which show that the king went to the
Sabhā just as much as to the Samiti,
and he cannot adduce any passage to
show that the Grāmaṇī presided.</F>
