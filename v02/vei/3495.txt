{@Sam-iti@}¦ denotes an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic tribe. It is
<div n="lb"/>already mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and often later,<sup>2</sup> sometimes
<div n="lb"/>in connexion with {@Sabhā.@}<sup>3</sup> Ludwig<sup>4</sup> considers that the Samiti
<div n="lb"/>included all the people, primarily the {%viśaḥ,%} ‘subjects,’ but also
<div n="lb"/>the {@Maghavans@} and Brahmins if they desired, though the
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā was their special assembly. This view is not probable,
<div n="lb"/>nor is that of Zimmer,<sup>5</sup> that the Sabhā was the village assembly.
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt appears to be right in holding that Samiti and
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā are much the same, the one being the assembly, the
<div n="lb"/>other primarily the place of assembly.<sup>6</sup>
[Page2-431+ 63]
<div n="P"/>The king went to the assembly<sup>7</sup> just as he went to the
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā. That he was elected there, as Zimmer<sup>8</sup> thinks, is as
<div n="lb"/>uncertain as whether he was elected at all (see {@Rājan@}). But
<div n="lb"/>there are clear signs that concord between king and assembly
<div n="lb"/>were essential for his prosperity.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is reasonable to assume that the business of the assembly
<div n="lb"/>was general deliberation on policy of all kinds, legislation so
<div n="lb"/>far as the Vedic Indian cared to legislate, and judicial work ({%cf.%}
<div n="lb"/>{@Sabhāsad@}). But of all these occupations there is, perhaps as a
<div n="lb"/>result of the nature of the texts, little or no evidence directly
<div n="lb"/>available.
<div n="P"/>The gods had a Samiti, hence called {%daivī,%} ‘divine,’<sup>10</sup> just as
<div n="lb"/>they had a Sabhā.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The assembly disappears as an effective part of government
<div n="lb"/>in the Buddhist texts,<sup>12</sup> the Epic,<sup>13</sup> and the law-books.<sup>14</sup>
