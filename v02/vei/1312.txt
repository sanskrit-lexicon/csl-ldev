{@Div,@}¦ ‘sky.’ The world as a whole is regarded as divided
into the three domains of ‘earth,’ ‘air’ or ‘atmosphere,’ and
‘heaven’ or ‘sky’ ({%div%}),<sup>1</sup> or alternatively into ‘heaven and
earth’ ({%dyāvā-pṛthivī%}),<sup>2</sup> which two are then considered as com-
prising the universe, the atmosphere being included in the sky.
Lightning, wind, and rain belong to the atmosphere, solar and
[Page1-361+ 56]
similar phenomena to the sky. In some passages<sup>3</sup> the vault
({%nāka%}) of the sky is added after the usual triad, and before the
celestial light ({%svar, jyotis%}).
<div n="P"/>The threefold division of the universe is reflected in a three-
fold division of the three elements — earth, air, and sky. Thus
a highest ({%uttama,%}<sup>4</sup> {%uttara,%}<sup>5</sup> {%pārya%}<sup>6</sup> ), a middle, and a lowest
heaven are specified.<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> the three heavens
are distinguished as ‘rich in water’ ({%udanvatī%}), as {%pīlumatī%} (of
uncertain meaning), and as the {%pradyaus,%} where the Fathers sit.
Heaven is frequently called {%vyoman%} as well as {%rocana%}<sup>8</sup> (properly
the ‘luminous space’ of heaven), and the dividing firmament
which separates the visible upper world from the highest
heaven is called, besides {%nāka,%} ‘vault,’ {%sānu,%} ‘summit,’ {%viṣṭap,%}
‘surface,’ and {%pṛṣṭha,%} ‘ridge,’ and even ‘ridge of the vault,’<sup>9</sup> or
‘summit of the vault.’<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Similarly three atmospheres ({%rajas%}), or oftener two, are
alluded to,<sup>11</sup> but the division here is merely artificial. In one
passage<sup>12</sup> six {%rajāṃsi,%} ‘regions,’ are referred to, the heavens
and the earths no doubt being meant. The usual name for the
atmosphere is {%antarikṣa.%}
<div n="P"/>The three earths are equally artificial, the origin of the triad
being probably the use of {%pṛthivī%} in the plural<sup>13</sup> to denote the
three divisions of the universe (just as {%pitarau,%} ‘two fathers,’
denotes ‘father and mother’).<sup>14</sup> The earth is called {%kṣam, kṣā,%}
{%gmā,%} or designated by the epithets {%mahī,%} ‘the great,’ {%pṛthivī%} or
{%urvī,%} ‘the broad,’ {%uttānā,%} ‘the extended,’ and is regularly con-
trasted as {%idam,%} ‘this world here,’ with the upper sphere.<sup>15</sup>
[Page1-362+ 59]
The shape of the earth is compared with a wheel in the
Rigveda,<sup>16</sup> and is expressly called ‘circular’ ({%pari-maṇḍala%}) in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>17</sup> When earth is conjoined with
heaven, the two are conceived as great bowls ({%camvā%}) turned
towards each other.<sup>18</sup> In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>19</sup> the two are
regarded as halves of an egg. The distance of heaven from
the earth is given by the Atharvaveda<sup>20</sup> as a thousand days'
journey for the sun-bird, by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>21</sup> as a
thousand days' journey for a horse, while the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> whimsically estimates the distance as equivalent
to a thousand cows standing one on the top of the other.
<div n="P"/>According to Zimmer,<sup>23</sup> the Vedic poets conceived the
atmosphere to be above the earth in its upper division only,
but below it in its lower stratum. The evidence,<sup>24</sup> however, for
the latter assumption is quite insufficient.<sup>25</sup> The theory of
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>26</sup> is that the sun merely reverses its
bright side at night, turning its light on the stars and the moon
while it retraverses its course to the east; and it has been
shown<sup>25</sup> that this is probably the doctrine of the Rigveda also.<sup>27</sup>

of the planets, see {@Graha.@}
<div n="P"/>There is no geographical division of the earth in Vedic
literature. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> states that
the centre of the earth is a span north of the {@Plakṣa Prāsravaṇā,@}
and that the centre of the sky is the constellation of the seven
Ṛṣis, the Great Bear. For the quarters, see {@Diś.@}
