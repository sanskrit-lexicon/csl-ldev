{@Sarasvatī@}¦<sup>1</sup> is the name of a river frequently mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda and later. In many passages<sup>2</sup> of the later texts it
<div n="lb"/>is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvatī, which loses
[Page2-435+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>itself in the sands of Patiala (see {@Vinaśana@}). Even Roth<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>admits that this river is intended in some passages of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda. With the {@Dṛṣadvatī@}<sup>4</sup> it formed the western boundary
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmāvarta (see {@Madhyadeśa@}). It is the holy stream of
<div n="lb"/>early Vedic India. The Sūtras<sup>5</sup> mention sacrifices held on its
<div n="lb"/>banks as of great importance and sanctity.
<div n="P"/>In many other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> and even later,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Roth held that another river, the {@Sindhu@} (Indus), was really
<div n="lb"/>meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvatī is
<div n="lb"/>called the ‘foremost of rivers’ ({%nadītamā%}),<sup>8</sup> is said to go to the
<div n="lb"/>ocean,<sup>9</sup> and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which
<div n="lb"/>many kings,<sup>10</sup> and, indeed, the five tribes, were located.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> and others.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Lassen<sup>14</sup> and Max Müller<sup>15</sup> maintain the
<div n="lb"/>identity of the Vedic Sarasvatī with the later Sarasvatī.<sup>16</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvatī was as
<div n="lb"/>large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the
[Page2-436+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron
<div n="lb"/>citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the
<div n="lb"/>Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive
<div n="lb"/>evidence of there having been any great change in the size or
<div n="lb"/>course of the Sarasvatī, though it would be impossible to deny
<div n="lb"/>that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there
<div n="lb"/>are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and
<div n="lb"/>the earlier Sarasvatī throughout. The insistence on the divine
<div n="lb"/>character of the river is been in the very hymn<sup>17</sup> which refers
<div n="lb"/>to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with
<div n="lb"/>its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the
<div n="lb"/>{@Pārāvatas,@} a people shown by the later evidence of the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> to have been in the east, a very long way
<div n="lb"/>from their original home, if Sarasvatī means the Indus. Again,
<div n="lb"/>the {@Pūrus,@} who were settled on the Sarasvatī,<sup>19</sup> could with great
<div n="lb"/>difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes
<div n="lb"/>might easily be held to be on the Sarasvatī, when they were, as
<div n="lb"/>they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the {@Bharatas@}
<div n="lb"/>in {@Kurukṣetra,@} and the Sarasvatī could easily be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the
<div n="lb"/>‘seven rivers’ in one passage<sup>20</sup> clearly designate a district: it
<div n="lb"/>is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the
<div n="lb"/>Indus and the {@Kubhā@} (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the
<div n="lb"/>Indus and the Sarasvatī. Nor is it difficult to see why the river
<div n="lb"/>is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never
<div n="lb"/>followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did
<div n="lb"/>actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long
<div n="lb"/>distance, and only in the Brāhmaṇa period was its disappear-
[Page2-437+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> that the five rivers go to the Sarasvatī,
<div n="lb"/>but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word {@Deśa@}
<div n="lb"/>shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those
<div n="lb"/>of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel
<div n="lb"/>in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an
<div n="lb"/>early production; if it is late it must refer to the later
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>22</sup> on the whole, adopts this view of the Saras-
<div n="lb"/>vatī,<sup>23</sup> but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a
<div n="lb"/>mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī,<sup>24</sup> as well as the name of the
<div n="lb"/>Arghandab in Arachosia.<sup>25</sup> This opinion depends essentially
<div n="lb"/>on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the
<div n="lb"/>scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself.<sup>26</sup> Brunn-
<div n="lb"/>hofer<sup>27</sup> at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but
<div n="lb"/>later<sup>28</sup> decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Śutudrī,
<div n="lb"/>the Sarasvatī comes between the Jumna

<F>20) Rv. viii. 24, 27. The connexion
<div n="lb"/>of Sarasvatī and the seven rivers is
<div n="lb"/>rather vague. In Rv. viii. 54, 4, Saras-
<div n="lb"/>vatī and the seven rivers are separately
<div n="lb"/>invoked, and in vi. 61, 10, 12, she is
<div n="lb"/>referred to as ‘seven-sistered’ ({%sapta-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%svasā%}). In vii. 36, 6, she is called the
<div n="lb"/>‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>one of the rivers. If the former passages
<div n="lb"/>are to be treated as precise, then {%sapta-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%svasā%} may be considered to show that
<div n="lb"/>the Sarasvatī was outside the river
<div n="lb"/>system (which would then be Indus,
<div n="lb"/>Kubhā, and the five rivers of the
<div n="lb"/>Panjab; see {@Sapta Sindhavaḥ@}); but
<div n="lb"/>the expression may be loosely meant
<div n="lb"/>for one of seven sisters.</F>
