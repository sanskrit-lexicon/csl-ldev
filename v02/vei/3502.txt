{@Sarasvatī@}¦<sup>1</sup> is the name of a river frequently mentioned in
the Rigveda and later. In many passages<sup>2</sup> of the later texts it
is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvatī, which loses
[Page2-435+ 70]
itself in the sands of Patiala (see {@Vinaśana@}). Even Roth<sup>3</sup>
admits that this river is intended in some passages of the
Rigveda. With the {@Dṛṣadvatī@}<sup>4</sup> it formed the western boundary
of Brahmāvarta (see {@Madhyadeśa@}). It is the holy stream of
early Vedic India. The Sūtras<sup>5</sup> mention sacrifices held on its
banks as of great importance and sanctity.
<div n="P"/>In many other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> and even later,<sup>7</sup>
Roth held that another river, the {@Sindhu@} (Indus), was really
meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvatī is
called the ‘foremost of rivers’ ({%nadītamā%}),<sup>8</sup> is said to go to the
ocean,<sup>9</sup> and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which
many kings,<sup>10</sup> and, indeed, the five tribes, were located.<sup>11</sup>
This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> and others.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Lassen<sup>14</sup> and Max Müller<sup>15</sup> maintain the
identity of the Vedic Sarasvatī with the later Sarasvatī.<sup>16</sup> The
latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvatī was as
large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the
[Page2-436+ 51]
sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron
citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the
Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive
evidence of there having been any great change in the size or
course of the Sarasvatī, though it would be impossible to deny
that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there
are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and
the earlier Sarasvatī throughout. The insistence on the divine
character of the river is been in the very hymn<sup>17</sup> which refers
to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with
its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the
{@Pārāvatas,@} a people shown by the later evidence of the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> to have been in the east, a very long way
from their original home, if Sarasvatī means the Indus. Again,
the {@Pūrus,@} who were settled on the Sarasvatī,<sup>19</sup> could with great
difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes
might easily be held to be on the Sarasvatī, when they were, as
they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the {@Bharatas@}
in {@Kurukṣetra,@} and the Sarasvatī could easily be regarded
as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the
‘seven rivers’ in one passage<sup>20</sup> clearly designate a district: it
is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the
Indus and the {@Kubhā@} (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the
Indus and the Sarasvatī. Nor is it difficult to see why the river
is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never
followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did
actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long
distance, and only in the Brāhmaṇa period was its disappear-
[Page2-437+ 50]
ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> that the five rivers go to the Sarasvatī,
but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word {@Deśa@}
shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those
of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel
in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an
early production; if it is late it must refer to the later
Sarasvatī.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>22</sup> on the whole, adopts this view of the Saras-
vatī,<sup>23</sup> but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a
mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī,<sup>24</sup> as well as the name of the
Arghandab in Arachosia.<sup>25</sup> This opinion depends essentially
on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the
scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh
Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself.<sup>26</sup> Brunn-
hofer<sup>27</sup> at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but
later<sup>28</sup> decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

<F>16) In the enumeration of rivers (evi-
dently from east to west) in Rv. x. 75, 5,
Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Śutudrī,
the Sarasvatī comes between the Jumna
and the Sutlej, the position of the
modern Sarsūti (Saraswatī), which,
flowing to the west of Thanesar, is
joined in Patiala territory by a more
westerly stream, the Ghaggar, and,
passing Sirsa, is lost in the desert at
Bhatnair; but a dry river bed (Hakra
or Ghaggar) can be traced from that
point to the Indus. See {%Imperial Gasetteer%}

<F>20) Rv. viii. 24, 27. The connexion
of Sarasvatī and the seven rivers is
rather vague. In Rv. viii. 54, 4, Saras-
vatī and the seven rivers are separately
invoked, and in vi. 61, 10, 12, she is
referred to as ‘seven-sistered’ ({%sapta-%}
{%svasā%}). In vii. 36, 6, she is called the
‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvatī
one of the rivers. If the former passages
are to be treated as precise, then {%sapta-%}
{%svasā%} may be considered to show that
the Sarasvatī was outside the river
system (which would then be Indus,
Kubhā, and the five rivers of the
Panjab; see {@Sapta Sindhavaḥ@}); but
the expression may be loosely meant
for one of seven sisters.</F>
