2. {@Keśin Dārbhya@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Dālbhya@}<sup>2</sup> (‘descendant of Darbha’) is a
<div n="lb"/>somewhat enigmatic figure. According to the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmana<sup>4</sup> he was a king,
<div n="lb"/>sister's son of {@Uccaiḥśravas,@} according to the latter authority.
<div n="lb"/>His people were the {@Pañcālas,@} of whom the Keśins must there-
<div n="lb"/>fore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold
<div n="lb"/>({%tryanīka%}).<sup>5</sup> A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with
<div n="lb"/>{@Ṣaṇḍika@} in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> this appears in another
<div n="lb"/>form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> He was a contemporary
<div n="lb"/>of a fellow sage, {@Keśin Sātyakāmi,@} according to the Maitrā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇī<sup>7</sup> and Taittirīya<sup>8</sup> Saṃhitās. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>attributes to him a Sāman or chant, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>10</sup> tells how he was taught by a golden bird.
<div n="P"/>In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to
<div n="lb"/>Dārbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator
<div n="lb"/>is right in thinking that the Śatapatha refers to a king and
<div n="lb"/>a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa is of no great authority. The
<div n="lb"/>latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Kāṭhaka
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> to the Keśin people signifies kingship, but this is
<div n="lb"/>hardly necessary.
<F>1) This is the form of the name in
<div n="lb"/>the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa; also later in the Bṛhaddevatā.</F>
<F>2) This is the form in the Kāṭhaka
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa. It also appears later in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda Anukramaṇī.</F>
