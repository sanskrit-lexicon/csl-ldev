2. {@Keśin Dārbhya@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Dālbhya@}<sup>2</sup> (‘descendant of Darbha’) is a
somewhat enigmatic figure. According to the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmana<sup>4</sup> he was a king,
sister's son of {@Uccaiḥśravas,@} according to the latter authority.
His people were the {@Pañcālas,@} of whom the Keśins must there-
fore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold
({%tryanīka%}).<sup>5</sup> A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with
{@Ṣaṇḍika@} in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> this appears in another
form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> He was a contemporary
of a fellow sage, {@Keśin Sātyakāmi,@} according to the Maitrā-
yaṇī<sup>7</sup> and Taittirīya<sup>8</sup> Saṃhitās. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup>
attributes to him a Sāman or chant, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh-
maṇa<sup>10</sup> tells how he was taught by a golden bird.
<div n="P"/>In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to
Dārbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator
is right in thinking that the Śatapatha refers to a king and
a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa is of no great authority. The
latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> to the Keśin people signifies kingship, but this is
hardly necessary.

the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa,
the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh-
maṇa; also later in the Bṛhaddevatā.</F>
<F>2) This is the form in the Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
