{@Ā-vasatha@}¦ (‘dwelling’). — The precise sense<sup>1</sup> of this term
appears to be a place for the reception of guests, especially
Brāhmaṇas and others on the occasion of feasts and sacrifices
(somewhat like the modern meaning of Dharma-śālā as a rest-
house for pilgrims), a use derived from the more general sense
of ‘abode.’<sup>2</sup>
