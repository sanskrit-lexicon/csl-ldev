{#विजयपुरकथा#}¦ ‘a short account of Vijayapur and its
Mohammedan sovereigns’ Mack. 98. The same tract
in 5 leaves is found in IO. 3179. Its title is Vijaya-
puramahārājadhānyāṃ Dakhanīpādaśāhānāṃ vistāraḥ.
This is a meagre list of the Mohammedan and Hindu
rulers of Vijayapura in the Dekkan, up to the conquest
by the Mlechas (the English), and was copied and
no doubt composed in 1808 by Pānduraṅga, son
of Rāma Jyotirvid, and great grandson of the astro-
nomer Tammaṇa, who lived under Aurangzīb.
