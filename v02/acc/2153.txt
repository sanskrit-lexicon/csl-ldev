{#आशाधर#}¦ of the Vyāghreravāla vaṃśa, a Jaina author,
son of Sallakṣaṇa, father of Chāhaḍa. His Triṣa-
ṣṭismṛtiśāstra is dated in 1236:
<HI1>Advaitaviveka. P. 12.
<HI1>Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayoddyota.
<HI1>Kāvyālaṃkāraṭīkā. Peters. 2, 85.
<HI1>Kuvalayānandakārikāṭīkā. 
[Page1-055-a+ 46]
<HI1>Grahagaṇita jy. B. 4, 124.
<HI1>Kovidānanda. Quoted in Triveṇikā.
<HI1>Triveṇikā or Śabdatriveṇikā. This last work as
well as the Advaitaviveka and the Kovidānanda
belong most likely to a later Āśādhara, as in
the Triveṇikā not only Mallinātha but also the
Siddhānatakaumudī are mentioned.
