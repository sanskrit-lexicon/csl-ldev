<L>50294<pc>282,3<k1>किम्<k2>किम्<h>b<e>2
<s>किम्</s> <hom>b</hom> ¦ is much used as a particle of interrogation like the <ab>Lat.</ab> <etym>num</etym>, <etym>an</etym>, sometimes translatable by ‘whether?’ but oftener serving only like a note of interrogation to mark a question (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>किं व्याधा वने ऽस्मिन् संचरन्ति</s>, ‘do hunters roam about in this wood?’ In an interrogation the verb, if uncompounded with a preposition, generally retains its accent after <s>किम्</s>, <ls>Pāṇ. 8-1, 44</ls>). To this sense may be referred the <s>किम्</s> expressing inferiority, deficiency, &c. at the beginning of compounds (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>किं-राजन्</s>, what sort of king? <ab>i.e.</ab> a bad king, <ls>Pāṇ. 2-1, 64; 5-4, 70</ls>)
