he was the typical representative of <ns>Brāhmanical</ns> rank, and the legends of his conflict with <s1 slp1="viSvA-mitra">Viśvā-mitra</s1>, who raised himself from the kingly or <s1 slp1="kzatriya">Kṣatriya</s1> to the <ns>Brāhmanical</ns> class, were probably founded on the actual struggles which took place between the <ns>Brāhmans</ns> and <s1 slp1="kzatriya">Kṣatriya</s1>s;
a great many hymns of the <ls>RV.</ls> are ascribed to these two great rivals;
those of the seventh <s1 slp1="maRqala">Maṇḍala</s1>, besides some others, being attributed to <s1 slp1="vasizWa">Vasiṣṭha</s1>, while those of the third <s1 slp1="maRqala">Maṇḍala</s1> are assigned to <s1 slp1="viSvA-mitra">Viśvā-mitra</s1>;
in one of <s1 slp1="vasizWa">Vasiṣṭha</s1>'s hymns he is represented as king <s1 slp1="su-dAs">Su-dās</s1>'s family priest, an office to which <s1 slp1="viSvA-mitra">Viśvā-mitra</s1> also aspired;
in another hymn <s1 slp1="vasizWa">Vasiṣṭha</s1> claims to have been inspired by <s1 slp1="varuRa">Varuṇa</s1>, and in another [<ls>RV. vii, 33, 11</ls>] he is called the son of the <s1 slp1="apsaras">Apsaras</s1> <s1 slp1="urvaSI">Urvaśī</s1> by <s1 slp1="mitra">Mitra</s1> and <s1 slp1="varuRa">Varuṇa</s1>, whence his patronymic <s1 slp1="mEtrAvaruRi">Maitrāvaruṇi</s1> <pb n="930,3"/>;
in <s1 slp1="manu">Manu</s1>, <ls>i, 35</ls>, he is enumerated among the ten <s1 slp1="prajA-pati">Prajā-pati</s1>s or Patriarchs produced by <s1 slp1="manu">Manu</s1> <s1 slp1="svAyamBuva">Svāyambhuva</s1> for the peopling of the universe;
in the <ls>MBh.</ls> he is mentioned as the family priest of the solar race or family of <s1 slp1="ikzvAku">Ikṣvāku</s1> and <s1 slp1="rAma-candra">Rāma-candra</s1>, and in the <s1 slp1="purARa">Purāṇa</s1>s as one of the arrangers of the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s in the <s1 slp1="dvApara">Dvāpara</s1> age;
he is, moreover, called the father of <s1 slp1="Orva">Aurva</s1> [<ls>Hariv.</ls>], of the <s1 slp1="sukAlin">Sukālin</s1>s [<ls>Mn.</ls>], of seven sons [<ls>Hariv.</ls>;
