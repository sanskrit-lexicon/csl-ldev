part of the 1st book and the 7th are thought to be comparatively modern additions;
the latter gives the history of <s1 slp1="rAma">Rāma</s1> and <s1 slp1="sItA">Sītā</s1> after their re-union and installation as king and queen of <s1 slp1="ayoDyA">Ayodhyā</s1>, afterwards dramatized by <s1 slp1="Bava-BUti">Bhava-bhūti</s1> in the <s1 slp1="uttara-rAma-caritra">Uttara-rāma-caritra</s1>;
<s1 slp1="rAma">Rāma</s1>'s character, as described in the <s1 slp1="rAmAyaRa">Rāmāyaṇa</s1>, is that of a perfect man, who bears suffering and self-denial with superhuman patience;
the author, <s1 slp1="vAlmIki">Vālmīki</s1>, was probably a <ns>Brāhman</ns> connected with the royal family of <s1 slp1="ayoDyA">Ayodhyā</s1>;
and although there are three recensions of the poem, all of them go back to a lost original recension, the ground work of which, contained in books 2-6, in spite of many amplifications and interpolations, may be traced back to one man, and does not like the <s1 slp1="mahABArata">Mahābhārata</s1>, represent the production of different epochs and minds), <ls>MBh.</ls>;
