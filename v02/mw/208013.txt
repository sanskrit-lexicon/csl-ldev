¦ ‘a worshipper of <ab n="Viṣṇu" slp1="vizRu">V°</ab>’ <ab>N.</ab> of one of the three great divisions of modern <ns>Hindūism</ns> (the other two being the <s1 slp1="SEva">Śaiva</s1>s and <s1 slp1="SAkta">Śākta</s1>s;
the <s1 slp1="vEzRava">Vaiṣṇava</s1>s identify <s1 slp1="vizRu">Viṣṇu</s1> - rather than <s1 slp1="brahmA">Brahmā</s1> and <s1 slp1="Siva">Śiva</s1> - with the supreme Being, and are exclusively devoted to his worship;
they have become separated into four principal and some minor sects, as follow: 1. the <s1 slp1="rAmAnuja">Rāmânuja</s1>s, founded by <s1 slp1="rAmAnuja">Rāmânuja</s1>, who is said to have lived for 120 years [from 1017 till 1137 A.D.] <pb n="1027,3"/>;
his chief doctrines are described at <pcol>p. 878, col. 1</pcol>, and in <ls>RTL. p.119</ls> &c.;
one peculiarity of his sect is the scrupulous preparation and privacy of three meals;
2. the <s1 slp1="mADva">Mādhva</s1>s, founded by a <ns>Kanarese</ns> <ns>Brāhman</ns> named <s1 slp1="maDva">Madhva</s1>, whose chief doctrines are described at <pcol>p. 782, col. 3</pcol>, and in <ls>RTL. p.130</ls> &c.; 3. the <s1 slp1="vallaBa">Vallabha</s1>s, founded by <s1 slp1="vallaBAcArya">Vallabhâcārya</s1>, whose chief doctrines are described at <pcol>p. 928, col. 3</pcol>, and in <ls>RTL. p.134</ls> &c.;
4. a sect in Bengal founded by <s1 slp1="cEtanya">Caitanya</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>] who was regarded by his followers as an incarnation of <s1 slp1="kfzRa">Kṛṣṇa</s1>;
his chief doctrine was the duty of <s>भक्ति</s>, or love for that god which was to be so strong that no caste-feelings could exist with it [see, <ls>RTL. p.140</ls> &c.] Of the minor <s1 slp1="vEzRava">Vaiṣṇava</s1> sects those founded by <s1 slp1="nimbArka">Nimbârka</s1> or <s1 slp1="nimbAditya">Nimbâditya</s1> [<ls>RTL. 146</ls>] and by <s1 slp1="rAmAnanda">Rāmânanda</s1> [<ls>RTL. 147</ls>] and by <s1 slp1="svAmi-nArAyaRa">Svāmi-Nārāyaṇa</s1> [<ls>RTL. 148</ls>] are perhaps the most important, to which also may be added the reformed theistic sect founded by <ns>Kabīr</ns> [<ls>RTL. 158</ls>] and the Sikh theistic sect founded by <ns>Nānak</ns> [<ls>RTL. 161</ls>])<info lex="inh"/>
