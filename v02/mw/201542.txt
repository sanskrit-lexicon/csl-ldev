<s>विश्वा꣡-मित्र</s> <hom>b</hom> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> (<ab>prob.</ab>) ‘friend of all’, <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated <s1 slp1="fzi">Ṛṣi</s1> or Sage (having the <ab>patr.</ab> <s1 slp1="gATina">Gāthina</s1>, <s1 slp1="gADeya">Gādheya</s1>, and <s1 slp1="jAhnava">Jāhnava</s1>;
he was at first a functionary, together with <s1 slp1="vasizWa">Vasiṣṭha</s1>, of <s1 slp1="su-dAs">Su-dās</s1>, king of the <s1 slp1="tftsu">Tṛtsu</s1>s;
seeing <ab n="Vasiṣṭha" slp1="vasizWa">V°</ab> preferred by the king, he went over to the <s1 slp1="Barata">Bharata</s1>s, but could not prevent their being defeated by <s1 slp1="su-dAs">Su-dās</s1>, although he caused the waters of the rivers <s1 slp1="vipAS">Vipāś</s1> and <s1 slp1="SutudrI">Śutudrī</s1> to retire and so give the <s1 slp1="Barata">Bharata</s1>s free passage, <ls>RV. iii, 33</ls>;
he was born as a <s1 slp1="kzatriya">Kṣatriya</s1>, deriving his lineage from an ancestor of <s1 slp1="kuSika">Kuśika</s1>, named <s1 slp1="purU-ravas">Purū-ravas</s1>, of the lunar race of kings, and himself sovereign of <s1 slp1="kanyA-kubja">Kanyā-kubja</s1> or <ns>Kanoj</ns>;
his fame rests chiefly on his contests with the great <ns>Brāhman</ns> <s1 slp1="vasizWa">Vasiṣṭha</s1>, and his success in elevating himself. though a <s1 slp1="kzatriya">Kṣatriya</s1>, to the rank of a <ns>Brāhman</ns> See <ls>Manu vii, 42</ls> : the <s1 slp1="rAmAyaRa">Rāmāyaṇa</s1>, which makes him a companion and counsellor of the young <s1 slp1="rAma-candra">Rāma-candra</s1>, records [<ls>i, 51-65</ls>] how <s1 slp1="viSvAmitra">Viśvāmitra</s1>, on his accession to the throne, visited <s1 slp1="vasizWa">Vasiṣṭha</s1>'s hermitage, and seeing there the cow of plenty [probably typical of <s>गो</s>, ‘the earth’], offered him untold treasures in exchange for it, but being refused, prepared to take it by force;
a long contest ensued between the king and the saint [symbolical of the struggles between the <s1 slp1="kzatriya">Kṣatriya</s1> and <ns>Brāhmanical</ns> classes], which ended in the defeat of <s1 slp1="viSvAmitra">Viśvāmitra</s1>, whose vexation was such that, in order to become a <ns>Brāhman</ns> and thus conquer his rival, he devoted himself to intense austerities [during which he was seduced by the nymph <s1 slp1="menakA">Menakā</s1> and had by her a daughter, <s1 slp1="SakuntalA">Śakuntalā</s1>], gradually increasing the rigour of his mortification through thousands of years, till he successively earned the titles of <s1 slp1="rAjarzi">Rājarṣi</s1>, <s1 slp1="fzi">Ṛṣi</s1>, <s1 slp1="maharzi">Maharṣi</s1>, and finally <s1 slp1="brahmarzi">Brahmarṣi</s1> <pb n="995,1"/>;
