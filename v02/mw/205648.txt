¦ <ab>N.</ab> of certain celebrated works which constitute the basis of the first period of the <ns>Hindū</ns> religion (these works were primarily three, <ab>viz.</ab> 1. the <s1 slp1="fg-veda">Ṛg-veda</s1>, 2. the <s1 slp1="yajur-veda">Yajur-veda</s1> [of which there are, however, two divisions See <s>तैत्तिरीय-संहिता</s>, <s>वाजसनेयि-संहिता</s>], 3. the <s1 slp1="sAma-veda">Sāma-veda</s1> <pb n="1015,2"/>;
these three works are sometimes called collectively <s>त्रयी</s>, ‘the triple <s1 slp1="vidyA">Vidyā</s1>’ or ‘threefold knowledge’, but the <s1 slp1="fg-veda">Ṛg-veda</s1> is really the only original work of the three, and much the most ancient [the oldest of its hymns being assigned by some who rely on certain astronomical calculations to a period between 4000 and 2500 <ab>B.C.</ab>, before the settlement of the <ns>Āryans</ns> in India;
and by others who adopt a different reckoning to a period between 1400 and 1000 <ab>B.C.</ab>, when the <ns>Āryans</ns> had settled down in the <ns>Panjāb</ns>];
subsequently a fourth <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> was added, called the <s1 slp1="aTarva-veda">Atharva-veda</s1>, which was probably not completely accepted till after <s1 slp1="manu">Manu</s1>, as his law-book often speaks of the three <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s-calling them <s>त्रयम् ब्रह्म सनातनम्</s>, ‘the triple eternal <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>’, but only once [<ls>xi, 33</ls>] mentions the revelation made to <s1 slp1="aTarvan">Atharvan</s1> and <s1 slp1="aNgiras">Aṅgiras</s1>, without, however, calling it by the later name of <s1 slp1="aTarva-veda">Atharva-veda</s1>;
each of the four <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s has two distinct parts, <ab>viz.</ab> 
1. <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>, <ab>i.e.</ab> words of prayer and adoration often addressed either to fire or to some form of the sun or to some form of the air, sky, wind &c., and praying for health, wealth, long life, cattle, offspring, victory, and even forgiveness of sins, and 
2. <s1 slp1="brAhmaRa">Brāhmaṇa</s1>, consisting of <s1 slp1="viDi">Vidhi</s1> and <s1 slp1="arTa-vAda">Artha-vāda</s1>, <ab>i.e.</ab> directions for the detail of the ceremonies at which the <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s were to be used and explanations of the legends &c. connected with the <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s [see <s>ब्राह्मण</s>, <s>विधि</s>], both these portions being termed <s>श्रुति</s>, revelation orally communicated by the Deity, and heard but not composed or written down by men [<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>IW. 24</ls> &c.], although it is certain that both <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s and <s1 slp1="brAhmaRa">Brāhmaṇa</s1>s were compositions spread over a considerable period, much of the latter being comparatively modern;
as the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s are properly three, so the <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s are properly of three forms, 1. <s1 slp1="fc">Ṛc</s1>, which are verses of praise in metre, and intended for loud recitation;
2. <s1 slp1="yajus">Yajus</s1>, which are in prose, and intended for recitation in a lower tone at sacrifices;
3. <s1 slp1="sAman">Sāman</s1>, which are in metre, and intended for chanting at the <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1> or Moon-plant ceremonies, the <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s of the fourth or <s1 slp1="aTarva-veda">Atharva-veda</s1> having no special name;
but it must be borne in mind that the <s1 slp1="yajur">Yajur</s1> and <s1 slp1="sAma-veda">Sāma-veda</s1> hymns, especially the latter, besides their own <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s, borrow largely from the <s1 slp1="fg-veda">Ṛg-veda</s1>;
the <s1 slp1="yajur-veda">Yajur-veda</s1> and <s1 slp1="sAma-veda">Sāma-veda</s1> being in fact not so much collections of prayers and hymns as special prayer- and hymn-books intended as manuals for the <s1 slp1="aDvaryu">Adhvaryu</s1> and <s1 slp1="udgAtf">Udgātṛ</s1> priests respectively [see <s>यजुर्-वेद</s>, <s>साम-वेद</s>];
the <s1 slp1="aTarva-veda">Atharva-veda</s1>, on the other hand, is, like the <s1 slp1="fg-veda">Ṛg-veda</s1>, a real collection of original hymns mixed up with incantations, borrowing little from the <s1 slp1="fg">Ṛg</s1> and having no direct relation to sacrifices, but supposed by mere recitation to produce long life, to cure diseases, to effect the ruin of enemies &c.;
each of the four <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s seems to have passed through numerous <s1 slp1="SAKA">Śākhā</s1>s or schools, giving rise to various recensions of the text, though the <s1 slp1="fg-veda">Ṛg-veda</s1> is only preserved in the <s1 slp1="SAkala">Śākala</s1> recension, while a second recension, that of the <s1 slp1="BAzkala">Bhāṣkala</s1>s, is only known by name;
a tradition makes <s1 slp1="vyAsa">Vyāsa</s1> the compiler and arranger of the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s in their present form: they each have an Index or <s1 slp1="anukramaRI">Anukramaṇī</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>], the principal work of this kind being the general Index or <s1 slp1="sarvAnukramaRI">Sarvânukramaṇī</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>];
out of the <s1 slp1="brAhmaRa">Brāhmaṇa</s1> portion of the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> grew two other departments of Vedic literature, sometimes included under the general name <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>, <ab>viz.</ab> the strings of aphoristic rules, called <s1 slp1="sUtra">Sūtra</s1>s [<ab>q.v.</ab>], and the mystical treatises on the nature of God and the relation of soul and matter, called <s1 slp1="upanizad">Upaniṣad</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>], which were appended to the <s1 slp1="AraRyaka">Āraṇyaka</s1>s [<ab>q.v.</ab>], and became the real <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> of thinking <ns>Hindūs</ns>, leading to the <s1 slp1="darSana">Darśana</s1>s or systems of philosophy;
in the later literature the name of ‘fifth <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>’ is accorded to the <s1 slp1="itihAsa">Itihāsa</s1>s or legendary epic poems and to the <s1 slp1="purARa">Purāṇa</s1>s, and certain secondary <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s or <s1 slp1="upa-veda">Upa-veda</s1>s [<ab>q.v.</ab>] are enumerated;
the <s1 slp1="vedANga">Vedâṅga</s1>s or works serving as limbs [for preserving the integrity] of the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> are explained under <s>वेदा<स्र्स्꣡>ङ्ग</s> below: the only other works included under the head of <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> being the <s1 slp1="pariSizwa">Pariśiṣṭa</s1>s, which supply rules for the ritual omitted in the <s1 slp1="sUtra">Sūtra</s1>s;
in the <s1 slp1="bfhad-AraRyaka">Bṛhad-āraṇyaka</s1> <s1 slp1="upanizad">Upaniṣad</s1> the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s are represented as the breathings of <s1 slp1="brahmA">Brahmā</s1>, while in some of the <s1 slp1="purARa">Purāṇa</s1>s the four <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>s are said to have issued out of the four mouths of the four-faced <s1 slp1="brahmA">Brahmā</s1> and in the <s1 slp1="vizRu-purARa">Viṣṇu-Purāṇa</s1> the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> and <s1 slp1="vizRu">Viṣṇu</s1> are identified), <ls>RTL. 7</ls> &c.; <ls>IW. 5; 24</ls> &c.
