the gods alarmed, asked the aid of the saint <s1 slp1="agastya">Agastya</s1>, who approached the <s1 slp1="vinDya">Vindhya</s1> and requested that by bending down he would afford him an easy passage to the South country, begging at the same time that he would retain a low position till his return;
this he promised to do, but <s1 slp1="agastya">Agastya</s1> never returned, and the <s1 slp1="vinDya">Vindhya</s1> range consequently never attained the elevation of the <s1 slp1="himAlaya">Himâlaya</s1>), <ls>Mn.</ls>;
