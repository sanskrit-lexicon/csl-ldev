<s>गन्धर्व/</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> a <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1> [though in later times the <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1>s are regarded as a class, yet in <ls>RV.</ls> rarely more than one is mentioned;
he is designated as the heavenly <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1> (<s>दिव्य/ ग्°</s>, <ls>RV. ix, 86, 36 and x, 139, 5</ls>), and is also called <s1 slp1="viSvA-vasu">Viśvā-vasu</s1> (<ls>RV. x, 85, 21 and 22; 139, 4 and 5</ls>)
and <s1 slp1="vAyu-keSa">Vāyu-keśa</s1> (in <ab>pl.</ab> <ls>RV. iii, 38, 6</ls>);
his habitation is the sky, or the region of the air and the heavenly waters (<ls>RV. i, 22, 14; viii, 77, 5; ix, 85, 12; 86, 36; x, 10, 4</ls>; <ls>AV. ii, 2, 3</ls>);
his especial duty is to guard the heavenly <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1> (<ls>RV. ix, 83, 4 and 85, 12</ls>), which the gods obtain through his intervention (<ls>RV.</ls>; <ls>AV. vii, 73, 3</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>RV. i, 22, 14</ls>);
it is obtained for the human race by <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1>, who conquers the <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1> and takes it by force (<ls>RV. viii, 1, 11 and 77, 5</ls>);
the heavenly <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1> is supposed to be a good physician, because the <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1> is considered as the best medicine;
possibly, however, the word <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1> originally denoted not the beverage so called, but the moon, and the heavenly <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1> may have been the genius or tutelary deity of the moon;
in one passage (<ls>RV. ix, 86, 36</ls>) the heavenly <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1> and the <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1> are identified;
he is also regarded as one of the genii who regulate the course of the Sun's horses (<ls>i, 163, 2; x, 177, 2</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>135, 5</ls>);
he knows and makes known the secrets of heaven and divine truths generally (<ls>x, 139, 5 and 6</ls>; <ls>AV. ii, 1, 2; xx, 128, 3</ls>; <ls>VS. xi, 1; xxxii, 9</ls>);
he is the parent of the first pair of human beings, <s1 slp1="yama">Yama</s1> and <s1 slp1="yamI">Yamī</s1> (<ls>RV. x, 10, 4</ls>), and has a peculiar mystical power over women and a right to possess them (<ls>RV. x, 85, 21 and 22; 40 and 41</ls>);
for this reason he is invoked in marriage ceremonies (<ls>AV. xiv, 2, 35 and 36</ls>);
ecstatic states of mind and possession by evil spirits are supposed to be derived from the heavenly <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1> (<ab>cf.</ab> <s>-गृहीत</s>, <s>-ग्रह</s>);
the <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1>s as a class have the same characteristic features as the one <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1>;

<ls>ĀśvŚr. x, 7, 3</ls>, know the best medicines (<ls>AV. viii, 7, 23</ls>;
<ls>VS. xii, 98</ls>), regulate the course of the asterisms (<ls>AV. xiii, 1, 23</ls>;

hence twenty-seven are mentioned, <ls>VS. ix, 7</ls>), follow after women and are desirous of intercourse with them (<ls>AV.</ls>;
<ls>ŚBr. iii</ls>);
as soon as a girl becomes marriageable, she belongs to <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1>, the <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1>s, and <s1 slp1="agni">Agni</s1> (<ls>Gṛhyās. ii, 19 f.</ls>;
<ls>Pañcat.</ls>;

<s1 slp1="purUravas">Purūravas</s1> is called among them (<ls>ib.</ls>);
in epic poetry the <s1 slp1="ganDarva">Gandharva</s1>s are the celestial musicians or heavenly singers (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>RV. x, 177, 2</ls>) who form the orchestra at the banquets of the gods, and they belong together with the <s1 slp1="apsarasa">Apsarasa</s1>s to <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1>'s heaven, sharing also in his battles (<ls>Yājñ. i, 71</ls>;
