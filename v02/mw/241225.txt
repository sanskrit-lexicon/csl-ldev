the twenty-fifth being <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1> or Spirit [sometimes called Soul] which is neither a Producer nor Production [see <s>विकार</s>], but wholly distinct from the twenty-four other <s1 slp1="tattva">Tattva</s1>s, and is multitudinous, each separate <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1> by its union with <s1 slp1="prakfti">Prakṛti</s1> causing a separate creation out of <s1 slp1="prakfti">Prakṛti</s1>, the object of the philosophy being to effect the final liberation of the <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1> or Spirit from the fetters caused by that creation;
the <s1 slp1="yoga">Yoga</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>] branch of the <s1 slp1="sAMKya">Sāṃkhya</s1> recognizes a Supreme Spirit dominating each separate <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1>;
