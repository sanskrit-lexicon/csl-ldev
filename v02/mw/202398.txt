although <s1 slp1="vizRu">Viṣṇu</s1> comes second in the triad he is identified with the supreme deity by his worshippers;
in the Vedic period, however, he is not placed in the foremost rank, although he is frequently invoked with other gods [<ab>esp.</ab> with <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1> whom he assists in killing <s1 slp1="vftra">Vṛtra</s1> and with whom he drinks the <s1 slp1="soma">Soma</s1> juice;
<ab>cf.</ab> his later names <s1 slp1="indrAnuja">Indrânuja</s1> and <s1 slp1="upendra">Upêndra</s1>];
as distinguished from the other Vedic deities, he is a personification of the light and of the sun, <ab>esp.</ab> in his striding over the heavens, which he is said to do in three paces [See <s>त्रि-विक्रम</s> and <ab>cf.</ab> <s>बलि</s>, <s>वामन</s>], explained as denoting the threefold manifestations of light in the form of fire, lightning, and the sun, or as designating the three daily stations of the sun in his rising, culminating, and setting <pb n="999,2"/>;

the great rivalry between him and <s1 slp1="Siva">Śiva</s1> [<ab>cf.</ab> <s>वैष्णव</s> and <s>शैव</s>] is not fully developed till the period of the <s1 slp1="purARa">Purāṇa</s1>s: the distinguishing feature in the character of the Post-vedic <s1 slp1="vizRu">Viṣṇu</s1> is his condescending to become incarnate in a portion of his essence on ten principal occasions, to deliver mankind from certain great dangers [<ab>cf.</ab> <s>अवतार</s> and, <ls>IW. 327</ls>];
some of the <s1 slp1="purARa">Purāṇa</s1>s make 22 incarnations, or even 24, instead of 10;
the <s1 slp1="vEzRava">Vaiṣṇava</s1>s regard <s1 slp1="vizRu">Viṣṇu</s1> as the supreme being, and often identify him with <s1 slp1="nArAyaRa">Nārāyaṇa</s1>, the personified <s1 slp1="puruza">Puruṣa</s1> or primeval living spirit [described as moving on the waters, reclining on <s1 slp1="Seza">Śeṣa</s1>, the serpent of infinity, while the god <s1 slp1="brahmA">Brahmā</s1> emerges from a lotus growing from his navel;
