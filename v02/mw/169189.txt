<s>यजुर्—वेद/</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> ‘the sacrificial <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>’, the collective body of sacred <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s or texts which constitute the <s1 slp1="yajur-veda">Yajur-veda</s1> (these <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s, though often consisting of the prose <s1 slp1="yajus">Yajus</s1>, are frequently identical with the <s1 slp1="mantra">Mantra</s1>s of the <s1 slp1="fg-veda">Ṛg-veda</s1>, the <s1 slp1="yajur-veda">Yajur-veda</s1> being only a sort of sacrificial prayer-book for the <s1 slp1="aDvaryu">Adhvaryu</s1> priests formed out of the <s1 slp1="fg-veda">Ṛg-veda</s1>, which had to be dissected and rearranged with additional texts for sacrificial purposes;
the most characteristic feature of the <s1 slp1="yajur-veda">Yajur-veda</s1> is its division into two distinct collections of texts, the <s1 slp1="tEttirIya-saMhitA">Taittirīya-saṃhitā</s1> and the <s1 slp1="vAjasaneyi-saMhitA">Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā</s1> <ab>q.v.</ab>;
the former of which is also called <s1 slp1="kfzRa">Kṛṣṇa</s1> <ab>i.e.</ab> ‘Black’, because in it the <s1 slp1="saMhitA">Saṃhitā</s1> and <s1 slp1="brAhmaRa">Brāhmaṇa</s1> portions are confused;
and the latter <s1 slp1="Sukla">Śukla</s1> <ab>i.e.</ab> ‘White’, because in this, which is thought the more recent of the two recensions, the <s1 slp1="saMhitA">Saṃhitā</s1> is cleared from confusion with its <s1 slp1="brAhmaRa">Brāhmaṇa</s1> and is as it were white or orderly;
the order of sacrifices, however, of both recensions is similar, two of the principal being the <s1 slp1="darSa-pUrRa-mAsa">Darśa-pūrṇa-māsa</s1> or sacrifice to be performed at new and full moon, and the <s1 slp1="aSva-meDa">Aśva-medha</s1> or horse-sacrifice;
