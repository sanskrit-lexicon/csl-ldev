when the gods had churned the ocean for the <s1 slp1="amfta">Amṛta</s1> or nectar of immortality, he disguised himself like one of them and drank a portion;
but the Sun and Moon revealed the fraud to <s1 slp1="vizRu">Viṣṇu</s1>, who cut off <s1 slp1="rAhu">Rāhu</s1>'s head, which thereupon became fixed in the stellar sphere, and having become immortal through drinking the <s1 slp1="amfta">Amṛta</s1>, has ever since wreaked its vengeance on the Sun and Moon by occasionally swallowing them;
while at the same time the tail of the demon became <s1 slp1="ketu">Ketu</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>] and gave birth to a numerous progeny of comets and fiery meteors;
in <ab>astron.</ab> <s1 slp1="rAhu">Rāhu</s1> is variously regarded as a dragon's head, as the ascending node of the moon [or point where the moon intersects the ecliptic in passing northwards], as one of the planets [<ab>cf.</ab> <s>ग्रह</s>], and as the regent of the south-west quarter [<ls>Laghuj.</ls>] <pb n="880,1"/>;
