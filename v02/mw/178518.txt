<s>रुद्र꣡</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> ‘Roarer or Howler’, <ab>N.</ab> of the god of tempests and father and ruler of the <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1>s and <s1 slp1="marut">Marut</s1>s (in the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1> he is closely connected with <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1> and still more with <s1 slp1="agni">Agni</s1>, the god of fire, which, as a destroying agent, rages and crackles like the roaring storm, and also with <s1 slp1="kAla">Kāla</s1> or Time the all-consumer, with whom he is afterwards identified;
though generally represented as a destroying deity, whose terrible shafts bring death or disease on men and cattle, he has also the epithet <s>शिव</s>, ‘benevolent’ or ‘auspicious’, and is even supposed to possess healing powers from his chasing away vapours and purifying the atmosphere;
in the later mythology the word <s>शिव</s>, which does not occur as a name in the <s1 slp1="veda">Veda</s1>, was employed, first as an euphemistic epithet and then as a real name for <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1>, who lost his special connection with storms and developed into a form of the disintegrating and reintegrating principle;
while a new class of beings, described as eleven [or thirty-three] in number, though still called <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1>s, took the place of the original <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1>s or <s1 slp1="marut">Marut</s1>s: in <ls>VP. i, 7</ls>, <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1> is said to have sprung from <s1 slp1="brahmA">Brahmā</s1>'s forehead, and to have afterwards separated himself into a figure half male and half female, the former portion separating again into the 11 <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1>s, hence these later <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1>s are sometimes regarded as inferior manifestations of <s1 slp1="Siva">Śiva</s1>, and most of their names, which are variously given in the different <s1 slp1="purARa">Purāṇa</s1>s, are also names of <s1 slp1="Siva">Śiva</s1> <pb n="883,2"/>;
those of the <ls>VāyuP.</ls> are <s1 slp1="ajEkapAd">Ajaikapād</s1>, <s1 slp1="ahir-buDnya">Ahir-budhnya</s1>, <s1 slp1="hara">Hara</s1>, <s1 slp1="nirfta">Nirṛta</s1>, <s1 slp1="ISvara">Īśvara</s1>, <s1 slp1="Buvana">Bhuvana</s1>, <s1 slp1="aNgAraka">Aṅgāraka</s1>, <s1 slp1="arDa-ketu">Ardha-ketu</s1>, <s1 slp1="mftyu">Mṛtyu</s1>, <s1 slp1="sarpa">Sarpa</s1>, <s1 slp1="kapAlin">Kapālin</s1>;
<ab>accord.</ab> to others the <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1>s are represented as children of <s1 slp1="kaSyapa">Kaśyapa</s1> and <s1 slp1="suraBi">Surabhi</s1> or of <s1 slp1="brahmA">Brahmā</s1> and <s1 slp1="suraBi">Surabhi</s1> or of <s1 slp1="BUta">Bhūta</s1> and <s1 slp1="su-rUpA">Su-rūpā</s1>;
<ab>accord.</ab> to <ls>VP. i, 8</ls>, <s1 slp1="rudra">Rudra</s1> is one of the 8 forms of <s1 slp1="Siva">Śiva</s1>;
elsewhere he is reckoned among the <s1 slp1="dik-pAla">Dik-pāla</s1>s as regent of the north-east quarter), <ls>RV.</ls> &c. &c. (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>RTL. 75</ls> &c.)<info lex="m"/>
