<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated Brāhmaṇa,
son of the great sage Kahoḍa.
[Kahoḍa married a daughter of his <lbinfo n="pre+ceptor"/>
[Page0207-c+ 59]
preceptor Uddālaka, but he was so <lbinfo n="devot+ed"/>
devoted to study that he generally neglected
her. When once she was far advanced in
pregnancy, the unborn son was <lbinfo n="provok+ed"/>
provoked at his father's neglect of her and <lbinfo n="re+buked"/>
rebuked him for his absorption in study
to the neglect even of his wife. The
sage was very angry at this <lbinfo n="imperti+nence"/>
impertinence and condemned him to be born
crooked; so he came forth with his
eight (ashṭa) limbs crooked (vakra);
whence his name; {#यस्मात्कुक्षौ वर्तमानो ब्रवीषि#}
{#तस्माद्वक्रो भवितास्यष्टकृत्वः#} <ls>Mb.</ls> When <lbinfo n="Ka+hoḍa"/>
Kahoḍa was drowned into a river as the
result of a wager in a dispute with a <lbinfo n="Bud+dhist"/>
Buddhist, young Ashṭāvakra defeated the
sage and delivered his father, who,
being pleased, directed his son to bathe
into the Samaṅgā river, on doing which
the lad became perfectly straight].
