{#अक्रूर#}¦ {%<ab>a.</ab>%} [{#न#}. {#त#}.] Not cruel. {#--रः#}
<ab>N.</ab> of a Yādava, a friend and uncle
of Kṛṣṇa. [It was he who induced
Rāma and Kṛṣṇa to go to Mathurā
and kill Kaṃsa. He told the two <lbinfo n="bro+thers"/>
brothers how their father Ānaka-Dundubhi,
the princess Devakī and even his own
father Ugrasena had been insulted by
the iniquitous demon Kaṃsa, and told
them why he had been despatched to
them. Kṛṣṇa consented to go and
promised to slay the demon within 3
nights, which he succeeded in doing.]
