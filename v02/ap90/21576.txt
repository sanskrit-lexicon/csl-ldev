[The sacrificial horse let loose by king
Yudhiṣṭhira and guarded by Arjuna
entered, in the course of its <lbinfo n="wander+ings"/>
wanderings, the country of Maṇipura, which
was then ruled by Babhruvāhana, <lbinfo n="un+equalled"/>
unequalled in prowess. The horse was
taken to the king; but when he read the
writing on the plate on its head, he
knew that it belonged to the Pāṇḍavas,
and that his father Arjuna had arrived
in the kingdom; and, hastening to him,
respectfully offered his kingdom and
his treasures along with the horse. <lbinfo n="Ar+juna"/>
Arjuna, in an evil hour, struck the head 
[Page0789-a+ 57]
of Babhruvāhana and upbraided him for
his cowardice, saying that if he had
possessed true valour and had been his
true son, he should not have been <lbinfo n="a+fraid"/>
afraid of his father and submitted to him
so meekly. At these words the brave
youth was exceedingly irritated and <lbinfo n="dis+charged"/>
discharged a crescent-shaped arrow at <lbinfo n="Ar+juna"/>
Arjuna which severed his head from his
body. He was, however, restored to
life by Ul{%upi%} who happened to be then
with Citrāṅgadā; and having <lbinfo n="acknow+ledged"/>
acknowledged Babhruvāhana as his true son,
he resumed his journey].
