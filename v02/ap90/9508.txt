of a sage [He was the son of <lbinfo n="Vi+bh"/>
Vibhāṇḍaka. According to mythical <lbinfo n="ac+count"/>
account he was born of a female deer, and
had a small horn on his forehead, and
hence called ‘Rishyaśṛṅga’, or <lbinfo n="‘deer+horned"/>
‘deerhorned’. He was brought up in the
forest by his father, and he saw no other
human being till he nearly reached his
manhood. When a great drought well
nigh devastated the country of Aṅga,
its king Lomapāda, at the advice of
Brāhmaṇas, caused Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to be
brought to him by means of a number
of damsels, and gave his daughter
Śāntā (adopted by him, her real father
being Daśaratha) in marriage to him,
who being greatly pleased caused <lbinfo n="copi+ous"/>
copious showers of rain to fall in his <lbinfo n="king+dom"/>
kingdom. It was this sage that <lbinfo n="perfor+med"/>
performed for king Daśaratha the sacrifice
which brought about the birth of Rāma
and his three brothers].
