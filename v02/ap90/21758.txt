Terrifying. {@--2@} A means of terrifying,

brother of Rāvaṇa. [Though a <lbinfo n="de+mon"/>
demon by birth, he was extremely sorry
for the abduction of Sītā by Rāvaṇa,
and severely reprimanded him for his
wicked act. He several times advised
Rāvaṇa to restore Sītā to Rāma if he
cared to live; but the proud demon
turned a deaf ear to his warnings.
At last seeing that the ruin of his
brother was inevitable, he repaired to
Rāma and became his staunch friend.
After the death of Rāvaṇa, Rāma
installed him on the throne of Laṅkā.
He is believed to be one of the seven
Cirajīvins; see {#चिरजीविन्#}.]
