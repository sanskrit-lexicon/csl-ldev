{#दुष्यंतः#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a king of the lunar
race, descendant of Puru, husband
of Śakuntalā and father of Bharata.
[Once upon a time Duṣyanta, while
hunting in the forest, went to the <lbinfo n="her+mitage"/>
hermitage of the sage Kaṇva, while <lbinfo n="pur+suing"/>
pursuing a deer. There he was hospitably
received by Śakuntalā, the adopted
daughter of the sage, and her <lbinfo n="transcend+ent"/>
transcendent beauty made so great an <lbinfo n="impres+sion"/>
impression on his mind that he prevailed on her
to become his queen, and married her
according to the {%Gandharva%} form of <lbinfo n="mar+riage"/>
marriage. Having passed some time in her
company the king returned to his <lbinfo n="capi+tal"/>
capital. After some months Śakuntalā was
delivered of a son, and her father thought
it advisable to send her with the boy to
her husband. But when they went and
stood before Duṣyanta, he (for fear of
public scandal) denied all knowledge
of having ever before seen or married
her. But a heavenly voice told him
that she was his lawful wife, and he
thereupon admitted her, along with
the boy, into his harem, and made her
first queen. The happy pair lived to
a good old age, and committing the
realm to the care of Bharata, retired to
the woods. Such is the account of <lbinfo n="Du+ṣyanta"/>
Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā given in the <lbinfo n="Ma+hābhārata"/>
[Page0573-c+ 58]
Mahābhārata; the story told by <lbinfo n="Kālidā+sa"/>
Kālidāsa differs in several important respects;
see “Śakuntalā.”].
