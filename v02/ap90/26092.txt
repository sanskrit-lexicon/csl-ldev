[According to a legend, the Vindhya
mountain, being jealous of the mount
Meru (or Himālaya) demanded that
the sun should revolve round himself
as about Meru, which the sun declined
to do; whereupon the Vindhya began
to rise higher and higher so as to <lbinfo n="ob+struct"/>
obstruct the path of the sun and moon.
The gods being alarmed sought the aid
of the sage Agastya, who approached
the mountain and requested that by
bending down he would give him an
easy passage to the south, and that he
would retain the same position till his
return. This Vindhya consented to do
(because according to one account, he
regarded Agastya as his teacher); but
Agastya never returned from the south,
and Vindhya never attained the height
of Meru]. {@--2@} A hunter. {#--ध्या#} {@1@}
