{#प्रद्युम्नः#}¦ An epithet of Cupid, the
god of love. [He was a son of Kṛṣṇa
and Rukmiṇī. When only six years
old, he was stolen away by the demon
Śambara, for he was foretold that <lbinfo n="Pra+dyumna"/>
Pradyumna would be his destroyer. <lbinfo n="Śam+bara"/>
Śambara cast the child into the roaring sea,
and a large fish swallowed it. This
fish was caught by a fisherman and
taken to the demon; and when it was
cut up, a beautiful child came out from 
[Page0749-c+ 59]
the belly, and Māyāvatī, the <lbinfo n="mis+tress"/>
mistress of Śambara's household, at the
desire of Nārada, carefully reared him
from childhood. As he grew up, she
was fascinated by the beauty of his <lbinfo n="per+son"/>
person, but Pradyumna reproved her for
entertaining towards himself feelings so
unbecoming a mother as he considered
her. But when he was told that he was
not her son, but of Viṣṇu and was cast
into the sea by Śambara, he became
enraged, and challenging him to fight,
succeeded in killing him by the force of
illusions. He and Māyāvatī afterwards
repaired to the house of Kṛṣṇa, where
Nārada told him and Rukmi{%ni%} that the
boy was their own and that Māyāvatī
was his wife].
