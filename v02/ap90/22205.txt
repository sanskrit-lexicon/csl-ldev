was begotten on Kuntī by the god
Wind From a child he showed that he

[Page0818-b+ 60]
called Vṛkodara, or ‘wolf-bellied’.
His most effective weapon was his mace.
He played a very important part in the
great war, and, on the last day of the
battle, smashed the thigh of Duryodhana
with his unfailing mace. Some of the
principal events of his earlier life are his
defeat of the Demons Hiḍimba and Baka,
the overthrow of Jarāsaṃdha, the fearful
vow which he uttered against the <lbinfo n="Kau+ravas"/>
Kauravas and particularly against <lbinfo n="Du+hśāsana"/>
Duhśāsana for his insulting conduct <lbinfo n="to+wards"/>
towards Draupadī, the fulfilment of that
