{#जटायुः, --जटायुस्#}¦ {%<ab>m.</ab>%} A son of Śyenī
and Aruṇa, a semi divine bird.
[He was a great friend of Daśaratha. 
[Page0504-b+ 59]
He once saved his life while he was
thrown down along with his car by
Saturn against whom he had proceeded
when a drought, said to be caused by
the planet, well-nigh devastated
the earth. While Rāvaṇa was carrying
away Sītā Jaṭāyu heard her cries in the
chariot and fought most desperately
with the formidable giant to rescue her
from his grasp. But he was mortally
wounded, and remained in that state
till Rāma passed by that place in the
course of his search after Sītā. The
kind-hearted bird told Rāma that his
wife had been carried away by <lbinfo n="Rāva+ṇa"/>
Rāvaṇa and then breathed his last. His
funeral rites were duly performed by
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa].
