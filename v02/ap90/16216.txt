pāda. The account of the elevation of
an ordinary mortal to the position of
the polar star runs thus. Uttānapāda
had two wives, Suruci and Sunīti, but
the latter was disliked by him. Suruci
had a son named Uttama, and Sunīti
gave birth to Dhruva. One day the boy
tried, like his elder brother, to take a
seat in his father's lap, but he was <lbinfo n="con+temptuously"/>
contemptuously treated both by the King
and his favourite wife. The poor child
went sobbing to its mother who told
him in consolatory terms that fortune
and favour were not attainable
without hard exertions. At these words
the youth left the paternal roof, retired
to the woods, and, though quite a lad,
performed such rigorous austerities
that he was at last raised by Viṣṇu
to the position of the Polar Star].
