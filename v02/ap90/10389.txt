a celebrated warrior on the side
of the Kauravas mentioned in
the Mahābhārata. [He was the son
of Kuntī begotten on her by the god
Sun while she was yet a virgin residing
at her father's house (see Kuntī). When
the child was born, Kuntī, afraid of the
censure of her relatives and also of <lbinfo n="pub+lic"/>
public scandal, threw the boy into the river
where he was found by Adhiratha,
charioteer of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and given
over to his wife Rādhā who brought him
up like her own child; whence Karṇa is
often called {%Sūtaputra%}, {%Rādheya%} &c.
Karṇa, when grown up, was made king
of Aṅga by Duryodhana, and became by
virtue of his many generous acts a type
of charity. On one occasion Indra
(whose care it was to favour his son
Arjuna) disguised himself as a <lbinfo n="Brāhma+ṇa"/>
Brāhmaṇa and cajoled him out of his divine
armour and ear-rings, and gave him in <lbinfo n="re+turn"/>
return a charmed javelin. With a desire to
make himself proficient in the science of
war, he, calling himself a Brāhmaṇa
went to Paraśurāma and learnt that
art from him. But his secret did not
long remain concealed. On one occasion
when Paraśurāma had fallen asleep with
his head resting on Karṇa's lap, a worm
(supposed by some to be the form <lbinfo n="assum+ed"/>
assumed by Indra himself to defeat Karṇa's
object) began to eat into his lap and
made a deep rent in it; but as Karṇa
showed not the least sign of pain, his
real character was discovered by his
preceptor who cursed him that the art
he had learnt would avail him not in
times of need. On another occasion
he was cursed by a Brāhmaṇa (whose
cow he had unwittingly slain in chase)
that the earth would eat up the wheel
of his chariot in the hour of trial. Even
with such disadvantages as these, he <lbinfo n="ac+quitted"/>
acquitted himself most valiantly in the
great war between the Pāṇḍavas and
Kauravas, while acting as generalissimo
of the Kaurava forces after Bhīṣma
and Droṇa had fallen. He maintained 
[Page0382-b+ 58]
the field against the Pāṇḍavas for three
days, but on the last day he was slain by
Arjuna while the wheel of his chariot
had sunk down into the earth. Karṇa
was the most intimate friend of <lbinfo n="Duryo+dhana"/>
Duryodhana, and with Śakuni joined him in all
the various schemes and plots that
were devised from time to time
for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas.]
