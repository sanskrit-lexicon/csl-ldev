{#भीष्म#}¦ {%<ab>a.</ab>%} [{#भी-णिच्-सुक्-अपादाने मक्#}]
Terrible, dreadful, frightful, fearful.
{#--ष्मः#} {@1@} The sentiment of terror (in
rhetoric), see {#भयानक#}. {@--2@} A demon,
an imp, a fiend, goblin. {@--3@} An <lbinfo n="epi+thet"/>
epithet of Śiva. {@--4@} <ab>N.</ab> of the son of
Śantanu by Gaṅgā. [He was the
youngest of the eight sons of Śantanu by
Gaṅgā; but all the others having died, he
remained the sole heir to the throne after
his father. On one occasion while Śantanu
was walking by the side of a river, he
beheld a charming young damsel named
Satyavatī, the daughter of a fisherman,
and, though bowed down with age, <lbinfo n="con+ceived"/>
conceived a passion for her, and sent his
son to negotiate the marriage. But the
parents of the girl said that if their
daughter bore sons to the king, they
would not succeed to the throne, for <lbinfo n="af+ter"/>
after his death Śantanava, being the <lbinfo n="right+ful"/>
rightful heir, would be the king. But <lbinfo n="Śān+tanava"/>
Śāntanava, to please his father, made a vow
to the parents that he would never <lbinfo n="ac+cept"/>
accept the kingdom or marry a wife or
become the father of children by any
woman, so that if their daughter bore a
son to Śantanu, he would be the king.
This ‘dreadful’ vow soon became known
abroad, and thenceforth he was called
{%Bhīṣma%}. He remained single, and, <lbinfo n="af+ter"/>
after the death of his father, he installed
Vicitravīrya, the son of Satyavatī, on 
[Page0819-a+ 59]
the throne, got him married to the two
daughters of king Kāśīrāja (see <lbinfo n="Ambi+kā"/>
Ambikā), and became the guardian of his
sons and grandsons, the Kauravas and
Pāṇḍavas. In the great war he fought
on the side of the Kauravas, but was
wounded by Arjuna with the assistance
of Śikhaṇḍin and was lodged in a ‘cage
of darts’. But having got from his <lbinfo n="fa+ther"/>
father the power of choosing his own time
for death, he waited till the sun had
crossed the vernal equinox, and then gave
up his soul. He was remarkable for his
continence, wisdom, firmness of resolve,
and unflinching devotion to God]. {#--ष्मं#}
Horror, horribleness. {@--Comp.@}  <lbinfo n="--azwa#mI"/>
{#--अष्टमी#} the eighth day in the light half

half of Kārtika (said to be sacred
to Bhīṣma) {#--सूः#} {%<ab>f.</ab>%} an epithet of
the river Ganges.
