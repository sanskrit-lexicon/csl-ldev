[The sage Agastya is a very reputed <lbinfo n="per+sonage"/>
personage in Hindu mythology. In the <lbinfo n="Ṛg+veda"/>
Ṛgveda he and Vasiṣṭha are said to be the
off-spring of Mitra and Varuṇa, whose
seed fell from them at the sight of the
lovely nymph Urvaśī at a sacrificial <lbinfo n="ses+sion"/>
session. Part of the seed fell into a jar and
part into water; from the former arose
Agastya who is, therefore, called <lbinfo n="Kum+bhayoni"/>
Kumbhayoni, Kumbhajanman, Ghaṭodbhava, 
[Page0010-a+ 73]
Kalaśayoni &c.; from the latter <lbinfo n="Vasiṣ+ṭha"/>
Vasiṣṭha. From his parentage Agastya is
also called Maitrāvaruṇi, Aurvaśeya,
and, as he was very small when he was
born, he is also called Mānya. He is <lbinfo n="re+presented"/>
represented to have humbled the Vindhya
mountains by making them prostrate
themselves before him when they tried
to rise higher and higher till they <lbinfo n="well+nigh"/>
wellnigh occupied the sun's disc and <lbinfo n="obstruct+ed"/>
obstructed his path, See Vindhya. (This fable
is supposed by some to typify the <lbinfo n="pro+gress"/>
progress of the Āryas towards the south in
their conquest and civilization of India,
the humbling of the mountain standing
metaphorically for the removal of <lbinfo n="phy+sical"/>
physical obstacles in their way). He is <lbinfo n="al+so"/>
also known by the names of Pītābdhi, <lbinfo n="Sa+mudra"/>
Samudra-culuka &c., from another fable
according to which he drank up the
ocean because it had offended him and
because he wished to help Indra and the
gods in their wars with a class of demons
called Kāleyas who had hid themselves
in the waters and oppressed the three
worlds in various ways. His wife was
Lopāmudrā. She was also called <lbinfo n="Kauṣī+takī"/>
Kauṣītakī and Varapradā. She bore him two
sons, Dṛḍhāsya and Dṛḍhasyu. In
the Rāmāyaṇa Agastya plays a <lbinfo n="distin+guished"/>
distinguished part. He dwelt in a hermitage
on mount Kuñjara to the south of the
Vindhya and was chief of the hermits
of the south. He kept under control the
evil spirits who infested the south and
a legend relates how he once ate up a
Rākṣasa named Vātāpi, who had <lbinfo n="assum+ed"/>
assumed the form of a ram, and destroyed by a
flash of his eye the Rākṣasa's brother
who attempted to avenge him. In the
course of his wanderings Rāma with his
wife and brother came to the hermitage
of Agastya who received him with the
greatest kindness and became his friend,
adviser and protector. He gave Rāma the
bow of Viṣṇu and accompanied him to
Ayodhyā when he was restored to his
kingdom after his exile of 14 years. The
superhuman power which the sage <lbinfo n="pos+sessed"/>
possessed is also represented by another
legend, according to which he turned
king Nahuṣa into a serpent and <lbinfo n="after+wards"/>
afterwards restored him to his proper form.
In the south he is usually regarded as the
first teacher of science and literature to
the primitive Dravidian tribes, and his
era is placed by Dr. Caldwell in the 7th
or 6th century <ab>B. C.</ab> The Purāṇas <lbinfo n="repre+sent"/>
represent Agastya as the son of Pulastya (the
sage from whom the Rākṣasas sprang)
and Havirbhuvā the daughter of <lbinfo n="Kar+dama"/>
Kardama. Several ‘hymn-seers’ are <lbinfo n="mention+ed"/>
mentioned in his family, such as his two sons,
Indrabāhu, Mayobhuva and Mahendra,
also others who served to <lbinfo n="perpe+tuate"/>
perpetuate the family. The sage is <lbinfo n="repre+sented"/>
represented as a great philosopher, <lbinfo n="benevo+lent"/>
benevolent and kind-hearted, unsurpassed
in the science of archery and to have
taken a principal part in the <lbinfo n="coloniza+tion"/>
colonization of the south; {#निर्जितासि मया भद्रे#} <lbinfo n="Sa#truhastAdamarziRA"/>
