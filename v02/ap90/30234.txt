<ab>N.</ab> of the wife of Satyavat, king
of Śālva. [She was the only daughter
of king Aśvapati. She was so lovely
that all the suitors that came to woo
her were repulsed by her superior lustre,
and thus though she reached a <lbinfo n="mar+riageable"/>
marriageable age, she found no one ready
to espouse her. At last her father
asked her to go and find out a husband
of her own choice. She did so, and
having made her selection returned to
her father, and told him that she had
chosen Satyavat, son of Dyumatsena,
King of Sālva, who being driven out
from his kingdom was then leading a
hermit's life along with his wife. When
Nārada, who happened to be present
there, heard this, he told her as well
as Aśvapati that he was very sorry
to hear of the choice she had made,
for though Satyavat was in every way
worthy of her, yet he was fated to
die in a year from that date, and in
choosing him, therefore, Sāvitrī would
be only choosing life-long widow-hood
and misery. Her parents, therefore,
naturally tried to dissuade her mind,
but the high-souled maiden told them
that her choice was unalterably fixed.
Accordingly the marriage took place
in due time, and Sāvitrī laid aside her
jewels and rich apparel, and putting
on the coarse garments of hermits, spent
her time in serving her old father and
mother-in-law. Still, though <lbinfo n="outward+ly"/>
outwardly happy, she could not forget the
words of Nārada, and as she counted,
the days seemed to fly swiftly like <lbinfo n="mo+ments"/>
moments, and the fated time, when her
husband was to die, drew near. ‘I
have yet three days’, thought she,
‘and for these three days I shall
observe a rigid fast.’ She maintained
her vow, and on the fourth day, when
Satyavat was about to go to the woods
to bring sacrificial fuel, she <lbinfo n="accompa+nied"/>
accompanied him. After having collected
some fuel, Satyavat, being fatigued, sat
down, and reposing his head on the
bosom of Sāvitrī fell asleep. Just
then Yama came down, snatched off
his soul, and proceeded towards the
south. Sāvitrī saw this and followed
the god who told her to return as
her husband's term of life was over.
But the faithful wife besought Yama
in so pathetic a strain that he granted
her boon after boon, except the life
of her husband, until, being quite <lbinfo n="sub+dued"/>
subdued by her devotion to her husband
and the force of her eloquent appeal, the
god relented and restored even the <lbinfo n="spi+rit"/>
spirit of Satyavat to her. Delighted she
returned, and found her husband as
if roused from a deep sleep, and <lbinfo n="in+forming"/>
informing him of all that had occurred, 
[Page1121-c+ 56]
went to the hermitage of her <lbinfo n="father+in"/>
fatherin-law who soon reaped the fruits of
the boons of Yama. Sāvitri is <lbinfo n="re+garded"/>
regarded as the {%beau ideal%} or highest
pattern of conjugal fidelity, and a
young married woman is usually <lbinfo n="bless+ed"/>
blessed by elderly females with the words
{#जन्मसावित्री भव#}, thus placing before her
the example of Sāvitrī for lifelong <lbinfo n="imi+tation"/>
imitation]. {@--Comp.@} {#--पतितः, --परिभ्रष्टः#} a
