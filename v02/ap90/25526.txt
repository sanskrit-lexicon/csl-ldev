{#वाल्मीकः, --वाल्प्तीकिः#}¦  [{#वल्मीके भवः#}
{#अण् इञ् वा#}] <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage,
and author of the Rāmāyaṇa.
[He was a Brāhmaṇa by birth, but
being abandoned by his parents in his
childhood, he was found by some wild
mountaineers who taught him the art
of thieving. He soon became an adept
in the art, and pursued his business
of plundering and killing (where <lbinfo n="neces+sary"/>
necessary) travellers for several years. One
day he saw a great sage whom he asked
on pain of death to deliver up his <lbinfo n="pos+sessions"/>
possessions. But the sage told him to go
home and ask his wife and children
if they were ready to become his <lbinfo n="part+ners"/>
[Page0962-c+ 61]
partners in the innumerable iniquities that
he had committed. He accordingly
went home, but returned dismayed at
their unwillingness. The sage then
told him to repeat the word {%marā%}
(which is {%Rāma%} inverted) and <lbinfo n="dis+appeared"/>
disappeared. The robber continued to
repeat it for years together without
moving from the place, so that his body
was covered up with ant-hills. But
the same sage reappeared and got him
out, and as he issued from the  <lbinfo n="‘valmī+ka"/>
‘{%valmīka%}’ he was called {%Vālmīki%}, and <lbinfo n="be+came"/>
became afterwards an eminent sage. One
day while he was performing his <lbinfo n="ablu+tions"/>
ablutions, he saw one of a pair of {%Krauncha%}
birds being killed by a fowler, at
which he cursed the wretch in words
which unconsciously took the form of
a verse in the Anuṣṭubh metre. This
was a new mode of composition, and
at the command of the god Brahman
he composed the first poem the <lbinfo n="Rāmā+yaṇa"/>
Rāmāyaṇa. When Sītā was abandoned by
Rāma, he gave her shelter under his
roof, and brought up her two sons.
He afterwards restored them all to
Rāma].
