{#अभिहित#}¦ {%<ab>p. p.</ab>%} {@1@} ({%a%}) Said, declared,
spoken, mentioned; {#मयाभिहितं#}, <lbinfo n="tenABi#hitaM"/>
{#तेनाभिहितं#} &c. ({%b%}) Predicated, asserted;  <lbinfo n="ana#Bihite"/>
{#अनभिहिते कर्मणि द्वितीया#} <ls>P. II. 3. 1-2</ls>. ({%c%})
Spoken to, addressed, called, named.
({%d%}) Whispered, prompted to say;
determined. {@--2@} Fastened, placed
upon. {#--तं#} A name, expression, word;
{#°त्वं#} being said or spoken to, a <lbinfo n="decla+ration"/>
declaration; authority, test. {@--Comp.@}  <lbinfo n="--a#nvayavAdaH"/>
{#--अन्वयवादः, --वादिन्#} {%<ab>m.</ab>%} a particular <lbinfo n="doc+trine"/>
doctrine (or the follower of that doctrine)
on the import of words, as opposed 
[Page0131-a+ 57]
to {#अन्विताभिधानवाद, --वादिन्#}. The  <lbinfo n="anvitā+bhidhānavādins"/>
{%anvitābhidhānavādins%} (the Mīmāṃsakas,
the followers of Prabhākara)
hold that words only express a
meaning ({#अभिधान#}) as parts of a <lbinfo n="sen+tence"/>
sentence and grammatically connected
with one another ({#अन्वित#}); that they,
in fact, only imply an action or
something connected with an
action; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} {#घटं#} in {#घटं आनय#} means
not merely ‘jar’, but ‘jar’ as <lbinfo n="con+nected"/>
connected with the action of ‘bringing’
expressed by the verb. The  <lbinfo n="abhihi+tānvayavādins"/>
{%abhihitānvayavādins%} (the Naiyāyikas, or
the followers of Kumārila who
hold the same doctrine) on the
other hand hold that words by <lbinfo n="them+selves"/>
themselves can express their own <lbinfo n="in+dependent"/>
independent meanings which are <lbinfo n="after+wards"/>
afterwards combined into a sentence
expressing one connected idea; that,
in other words, it is the logical <lbinfo n="con+nection"/>
connection between the words of a <lbinfo n="sen+tence"/>
sentence, and not the sense of the
words themselves, that suggests the
import or purport of that sentence;
they thus believe in a {%tātparyārtha%}
as distinguished from {%vāchyārtha%};
