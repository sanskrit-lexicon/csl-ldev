{#दिलीपः#}¦ A king of the Solar
race, son of {#अंशुमत्#} and father of
{#भगीरथ#}, but according to Kālidāsa,
of {#रघु#}. [He is described by <lbinfo n="Kā+lidāsa"/>
Kālidāsa as a grand ideal of what a king
should be. His wife was Sudakṣiṇā,
a woman in every respect worthy of her
husband; but they had no issue. For
this he went to his family priest <lbinfo n="Va+sishṭha"/>
[Page0565-b+ 58]
Vasishṭha who told him and his wife to
serve the celestial cow Nandinī. They
accordingly served her for 21 days and
were on the 22nd day favoured by the
cow. A glorious boy was then born
who conquered the whole world and
became the founder of the line of the
Raghus.]
