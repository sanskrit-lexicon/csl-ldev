{#मलय#}¦ One of the seven principal chains of mountains
in India. It is most probably to be identified with
the southern portion of the Ghāts running from
the south of Mysore, and forming the eastern
boundary of Travancore. It is said by Bhavabhūti
to be encircled by the river Kāverī (<ls>Mv. 5. 3</ls>,
also <ls>R. 4. 46</ls>), and is said to teem in cardamoms,
pepper, sandal, and betel-nut trees. In <ls>R. 4. 51</ls>
Kālidāsa calls the mountains Malaya and Dardura
‘the two breasts of the southern region.’  <lbinfo n="Dar+dura"/>
{%Dardura%} is, therefore, that portion of the Ghāts,
which forms the south-eastern boundary of <lbinfo n="My+sore"/>
Mysore.
