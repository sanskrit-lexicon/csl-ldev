{#दमयंती#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of
Bhīma, king of the Vidarbhas.
[She was so called because by her
matchless beauty she subdued the 
[Page0557-c+ 62]
ride of all lovely women; <ab>cf.</ab>  <lbinfo n="ls:N. 2.+ 18"/>
<ls>N. 2. 18</ls>: --{#भुवनत्रयसुभ्रुवामसौ दमयंती#} <lbinfo n="kamanIya#tAmadaM"/>
{#कमनीयतामदं । उदियाय यतस्तनुश्रिया दमयंतीति#} <lbinfo n="ta#to"/>
{#ततोऽभिधां दधौ ॥#}. A golden swan first
described to her the beauty and virtues
of king Nala, and through him she
communicated her love to Nala. <lbinfo n="After+wards"/>
Afterwards at a Svayaṃvara she chose
Nala for her husband from out of a
host of competitors among whom were
the four gods Indra, Agni, Yama, and
Varuṇa themselves, and the lovely pair
spent some years very happily. But
their happiness was not destined to
last long. Kali, envious of the good
fortune of Nala, entered his body,
and induced him to play at dice
with his brother Puṣkara. In the
heat of the play the infatuated
monarch staked and lost everything
except himself and his wife. Nala and
Damayantī were therefore driven out of
the kingdom, ‘clad in a single <lbinfo n="gar+ment"/>
garment’. While wandering through the
wilderness, Damayantī had to pass
through several trying adventures, but
her devotion to her husband remained
entirely unshaken. One day while she
was asleep, Nala in the frenzy of <lbinfo n="des+pair"/>
despair abandoned her, and she was <lbinfo n="ob+liged"/>
obliged to go to her father's house. After
some time she was united with her
husband, and they passed the rest of
their lives in the undisturbed <lbinfo n="enjoy+ment"/>
enjoyment of happiness. See Nala and <lbinfo n="Ṛtu+parṇa"/>
Ṛtuparṇa also].
