{#नहुषः#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a king of the lunar
race, son of Āyus and grandson of
Purūravas and father of Yayāti. 
[Page0612-a+ 58]
[He was a very wise and powerful king,
and when Indra lay concealed under
waters to expiate the sin of having <lbinfo n="kill+ed"/>
killed the demon Vṛtra, a Brāhmaṇa, he
was asked to occupy his seat. While
there he thought of winning the love
of Indr{%ani%} and caused the seven sages to
convey him in a palanquin to her house.
On his way he asked each of them to
be quick using the words {%‘sarpa’%},
{%‘sarpa’%} (move on, move on), when one
of the sages (Agastya ?) cursed him to
be a {%‘sarpa’%} (serpent). He fell down from
the sky, and remained in that wretched
state till he waś relieved from it by
Yudhiṣṭhira].
