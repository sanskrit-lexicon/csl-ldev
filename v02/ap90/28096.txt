{#शुनःशेपः(फः)#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a Vedic
sage, son of Ajīgarta. [In the <lbinfo n="Aita+reya"/>
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa it is related that king
Hariścandra, being childless, made a
vow that on obtaining a son he would
sacrifice him to the god Varuṇa. A son
was born who was named Rohita, but
the king put off the fulfilment of the
vow under various pretexts. At last <lbinfo n="Ro+hita"/>
Rohita purchased for one hundred cows
Śunaḥśepha, the middle son of <lbinfo n="Ajīgar+ta"/>
Ajīgarta, as a substitute for himself to be
offered to Varuṇa. But the boy <lbinfo n="prais+ed"/>
praised Viṣṇu, Indra, and other deities, and
escaped death. He was then adopted
by Viśvāmitra in his own family and
called by the name Devarāta].
