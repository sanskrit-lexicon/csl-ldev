<L>31289<pc>1167-a<k1>हरिश्चंद्रः<k2>हरिश्चंद्रः
{#हरिश्चंद्रः#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a king of the solar
dynasty. [He was the son of <lbinfo n="Tri+śanku"/>
Triśanku and was famous for his
liberality, probity, and unflinching <lbinfo n="ad+herence"/>
adherence to truth. On one occasion
his family-priest Vasiṣṭha <lbinfo n="commend+ed"/>
commended his qualities in the presence of
Viśvāmitra, who refused to believe them.
A quarrel thereupon ensued, and it
was at last decided that Viśvāmitra
should himself test the king. The
sage accordingly subjected him to the
most crucial test with a view to see
if he could not be but once made to
swerve from his plighted word. The
king, however, stood the test with
exemplary courage, adhering to his
word though he had to forego the
kingdom, to sell off his wife and
son, and at last, even his own self to
a low-caste man, and-as the last
test, as it were, of his truthfulness
and courage-to be even ready to
put his own wife to death as a
witch! Viśvāmitra there-upon <lbinfo n="ac+knowledged"/>
acknowledged himself vanquished, and
the worthy king was elevated along
with his subjects to heaven].
