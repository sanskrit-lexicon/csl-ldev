{#द्रौपदी#}¦ [{#द्रुपदस्यापत्यं स्त्री-अण् ङीप्#}]
<ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of Drupada, 
[Page0586-c+ 62]
king of the Pāñcālas. [She was
won by Arjuna at her <lbinfo n="Svayam+vara"/>
Svayamvara ceremony, and when he and his
brothers returned home they told their
mother that they had that day made
a great acquisition. Whereupon the
mother said “Well, then, my dear
children, divide it amongst yourselves.”
As her words once uttered could not
be changed, she became the common
wife of the five brothers. When
Yudhiṣṭhira lost his kingdom and
even himself and Draupadī in <lbinfo n="gambl+ing"/>
gambling, she was grossly insulted by <lbinfo n="Du+h"/>
Duhśāsana <ab>q. v.</ab> and by Duryodhana's
wife. But these and the like insults
śhe bore with uncommon patience and
endurance; and on several occasions, when
she and her husbands were put to the
test, she saved their credit (as on the
occasion of Durvāsas begging food at
night for his 60,000 pupils). At last,
however, her patience was exhausted,
and she taunted her husbands for the
very tame way in which they put up
with the insults and injuries inflicted
upon them by their enemies; (see  <lbinfo n="ls:Ki.+ 1. 29"/>
<ls>Ki. 1. 29-46</ls>). It was then that the <lbinfo n="Pāṇḍa+vas"/>
Pāṇḍavas resolved to enter upon the great
Bhāratī war. She is one of the five
very chaste women whose names one is
recommended to repeat; see {#अहल्या#}].
