race, sixth in descent from Bharata.
[He was very pious and benevolent. He
possessed enormous riches, but he spent
them in performing grand sacrifices.
So great was the number of animals
slaughtered during his reign both in
sacrifices as well as for use in his kitchen
that a river of blood is supposed to
have issued from their hides which
was afterwards appropriately called
