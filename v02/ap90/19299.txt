was the son of Veṇa, son of Aṅga. He
was called the first king, from whom
the earth received her name Pṛthvī.
The Viṣṇu Purāṇa relates that when
Veṇa who was wicked by nature and
prohibited worship and sacrifice, was
beaten to death by the pious sages, and
when consequently robbery and <lbinfo n="anar+chy"/>
anarchy prevailed in the absence of a King,
the Munis rubbed the right arm of the
dead king to produce a son, and from
it sprang the majestic Pṛthu, glowing
like Agni. He was immediately <lbinfo n="de+clared"/>
declared King, and his subjects who had
suffered from famine, besought the <lbinfo n="mo+narch"/>
monarch for the edible fruits and plants
which the earth withheld from them.
In anger Pṛthu took up his bow to <lbinfo n="com+pel"/>
compel her to yield the supply so much
needed by his subjects. She assumed
the form of a cow and began to flee
chased by the King. But she at last
yielded and requested him to spare her
life, and at the same time promised to
restore all the needed fruits, plants &c.,
‘if a calf were given to her through
which she might be able to secrete
milk’. Pṛthu thereupon made <lbinfo n="Svā+yambhuva"/>
Svāyambhuva Manu the calf milked the
earth, and received the milk into his
own hand, from which proceeded all
kinds of corn, vegetables, fruits &c.,
for the maintenance of his subjects.
The example of Pṛthu was afterwards
followed by a variety of milkers-gods,
men, Ṛṣis, mountains, Nāgas, Asuras
&c., who found out the proper <lbinfo n="milk+man"/>
milkman and calf from their own number,
and milked the earth of whatever they
wanted; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Ku. 1. 2</ls>]. {#--थु#} {%<ab>f.</ab>%} Opium
