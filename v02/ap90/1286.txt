Śakuntalā. {@--3@} <ab>N.</ab> of Atri's wife, the
highest type of chastity and wifely
devotion. [She was very pious and given
to austere devotion by virtue of which she
had obtained miraculous powers. Several
stories are told to illustrate them. When
the earth was devastated by a terrible
drought which lasted for 10 years, <lbinfo n="Ana+sūya"/>
Anasūya created water, fruits, roots &c. by
means of her ascetic powers and saved
many lives. On one occasion when
the sage Māṇḍavya was about to be
impaled, the wife of a sage happened to
touch the stake as she passed by, where
upon Māṇḍavya cursed her that she
would become a widow at sunrise. She,
however, prevented the sun from rising,
and all actions of men being <lbinfo n="conse+quently"/>
[Page0060-b+ 62]
consequently stopped, the gods, sages &c.
went to Anasūyā, her friend, who, by
the force of her penance, made the sun
rise without, at the same time, bringing
widowhood on her friend. Another
legend is also told in which Anasūyā
changed Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśa
into infants, when, at the instigation of
their wives, they attempted to test her
chastity, but restored them to their <lbinfo n="form+er"/>
former shapes at the importunities of their
humbled consorts. She is also said to
have caused the three-streamed Ganges
to flow down on the earth near the
hermitage of her husband for the <lbinfo n="ablu+tions"/>
ablutions of sages; see <ls>R. 13. 51.</ls> In the
Rāmāyaṇa she is represented as having
been very kind and attentive to Sītā
whom she favoured with sound <lbinfo n="mother+ly"/>
motherly advice on the virtues of chastity, and
at the time of her departure gave her
an unguent (See <ls>R. 12. 27</ls>, <ls n="R.">14. 14</ls>)
which was to keep her beautiful for ever
and to guard her person from the <lbinfo n="at+tempts"/>
attempts of rapacious beasts, demons &c.
She was the mother of the irascible
sage Durvāsas].
