{#कैकेयः#}¦ [{#केकयानांराजा, अण्#}] A prince
or ruler of the Kekayas. {#--यी#} A
daughter of the prince of the <lbinfo n="Ke+kayas"/>
Kekayas and one (the youngest) of the
three wives of king Daśaratha and
mother of Bharata. [When Rāma was
about to be installed as heir-apparent,
she was not less rejoiced than Kausalya.
But she had a very wicked nurse called
Mantharā who long owed Rāma a
grudge. Finding this to be an excellent
opportunity for her revenge, Mantharā
so completely perverted the mind of
Kaikeyī that she became ready to ask
the king, as suggested by her nurse, to
grant her the two boons which he had
formerly promised to her. By one of 
[Page0424-c+ 57]
these boons she asked for the <lbinfo n="installa+tion"/>
installation of her son Bharata, and by the
other for the banishment of Rāma for
fourteen years. Daśaratha, blinded by
passion as he was, severely scolded her
for her wicked demands, but was at last
obliged to yield. On account of this
wicked act her name has become <lbinfo n="pro+verbial"/>
proverbial for ‘a shrew’, or ‘Xanthippe’].
