{#देवयानी#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of
Śukra, preceptor of the {%Asuras%}.
[She fell in love with Kaca, her
father's pupil, but he rejected her
advances. On this she cursed the
youth, who in return cursed her that
she should become the wife of a
Kṣatriya; (see {#कच#}). Once upon a
time Devayānī and her companion
Śarmiṣṭhā--the daughter of <lbinfo n="Vṛsha+parvan"/>
Vṛshaparvan, the king of the Daityas,
went to bathe keeping their clothes
on the shore. But the god Wind <lbinfo n="chang+ed"/>
changed their clothes, and when they were
dressed they began to quarrel about the
change until Śarmiṣṭhā so far lost
her temper that she slapped <lbinfo n="Devayā+nī"/>
Devayānī's face, and threw her into a well.
There she remained until she was seen
and rescued by Yayāti, who, with the
consent of her father, married her, and
Śarmiṣṭhā became her servant as a
recompense for her insulting conduct
towards her. Devayānī lived happily
with Yayāti for some years and bore
him two sons, Yadu and Turvasu.
Subsequently her husband became <lbinfo n="ena+moured"/>
enamoured of Śarmiṣṭhā, and Devayānī,
feeling herself aggrieved, abruptly left
her husband and went home to her
father, who at her request condemned
Yayāti with the infirmity of old age;
see Yayāti also].
