{#जमदग्निः#}¦ A Brāhmaṇa and <lbinfo n="de+scendant"/>
descendant of Bhṛgu and father of
Paraśurāma. [Jamadagni was the
son of Ṛcīka and Satyavatī. He
was a pious sage, deeply engaged
in study, and is said to have <lbinfo n="obtain+ed"/>
obtained entire possession of the Vedas. His
wife was Reṇukā who bore him five sons.
One day when she had gone out to bathe,
she beheld a loving pair of Gandharvas
(according to some Citraratha and his
queen) sporting and playing in the
water. The lovely sight made her feel
envious of their pleasure, and she <lbinfo n="return+ed"/>
returned defiled by unworthy thoughts, <lbinfo n="‘wet+ted"/>
‘wetted but not purified by the stream’. Her
husband, who was anger incarnate, <lbinfo n="see+ing"/>
seeing her shorn of the lustre of her <lbinfo n="sanc+tity"/>
sanctity, furiously scolded her, and ordered
his sons, as they came in, to cut off her
head. But the first four sons shrank
from that cruel deed. It was only <lbinfo n="Para+śurāma"/>
Paraśurāma, the youngest, that with <lbinfo n="charac+teristic"/>
characteristic obedience to his father's <lbinfo n="com+mand"/>
command, struck off her head with his axe.
The deed pacified the father's anger, and
he desired Paraśurāma to ask a boon.
The kind-hearted son begged that his
mother might be restored to life which
the father readily granted].
