<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage. [He was
originally a Kṣatriya, being the king
of Kanyakubja and son of Gādhi. One
day while out hunting, he went to the
hermitage of the great sage Vasiṣṭha,
and seeing there the cow of plenty, <lbinfo n="of+fered"/>
offered him untold treasures in <lbinfo n="ex+change"/>
exchange for it, but being refused he
tried to take it by force. A long <lbinfo n="con+test"/>
contest thereupon ensued, in which king
Viśvāmitra was signally defeated; and
so great was his vexation, and withal
so greatly was he impressed with the
power inherent in Brāhmanism that he
devoted himself to the most rigorous
austerities till he successively got the
titles {%Rājarṣi%}, {%Ṛṣi%}, {%Maharṣi%}, and
{%Brahmarṣi%}, but he was not <lbinfo n="content+ed"/>
contented till Vasiṣṭha himself called him by
the name {%Brahmarṣi%}, which, however,
took place after several thousands of
years. Viśvāmitra several times tried
to excite Vasiṣṭha-for example by
killing his one hundred sons-but the
great sage was not in the least <lbinfo n="perturb+ed"/>
perturbed. His power, even before he <lbinfo n="final+ly"/>
finally became a Brahmarṣi, was very great,
as was seen in his transporting <lbinfo n="Tri+śanku"/>
Triśanku to the skies, in saving <lbinfo n="Śunah+śepha"/>
Śunahśepha from the hands of Indra, in
creating things after the style of <lbinfo n="Brah+man"/>
Brahman &c. &c. He was the companion
and counsellor of young Rāma to whom
he gave several miraculous missiles].
