{#भर्तृहरि#}¦ Author of the three Śatakas and of the <lbinfo n="Vākya+padīya"/>
Vākyapadīya. Mr. Telang gives it as his opinion that
he must have flourished about the close of the
first and the beginning of the second century of
the Christian era. Tradition makes him brother of
king Vikrama, and if this Vikrama be accepted
as the same who defeated the Mlecchas in 544
<ab>A. D.</ab>, we must suppose Bhartṛhari to have <lbinfo n="flourish+ed"/>
flourished in the latter half of the sixth century.
