{#द्रुपदः#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a king of the <lbinfo n="Pān+chālas"/>
Pānchālas. [He was a son of Pṛṣata. He
and Droṇa were school-fellows, as they
[Page0585-c+ 59]
learnt the science of archery from Droṇa's
father, Bharadvāja. After Drupada had
succeeded to the throne, Droṇa, when in
pecuniary difficulties, went to him on
the strength of his former friendship,
but the proud monarch disrespected and
slighted him. For this Droṇa afterwards
got him captured by his pupils the
Pāṇḍavas, but waś kind enough to spare
his life, and allowed him to retain half
his kingdom. But the defeat sustained
by him at Droṇa's hands rankled in his
soul, and with the desire of getting a son
who would avenge the wrong done to
him, he performed a sacrifice, when a
son named Dhṛṣṭadyumna (and a
daughter called Draupadī) sprang up
from the fire. This son afterwards <lbinfo n="trea+cherously"/>
treacherously cut off the head of Droṇa; see
Droṇa also].
