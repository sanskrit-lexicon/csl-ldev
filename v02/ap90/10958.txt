people. {@--4@} <ab>N.</ab> of the <lbinfo n="commander-in+chief"/>
commander-inchief of king Virāṭa. [While <lbinfo n="Drau+padī"/>
Draupadī in the guise of Sairandhrī was <lbinfo n="re+siding"/>
residing at the court of king Virāṭa with
her five husbands also disguised, <lbinfo n="Kīcha+ka"/>
Kīchaka once happened to see her, and her
beauty stirred up wicked passion in his
heart. He thenceforward kept a sinister
eye on her, and endeavoured through
the help of his sister, the king's wife, to
violate her chastity. Draupadī <lbinfo n="com+plained"/>
complained of his unmannerly conduct <lbinfo n="to+wards"/>
towards herself to the king; but when he
declined to interfere, she sought the
assistance of Bhīma, and at his <lbinfo n="sugges+tion"/>
suggestion showed herself favourable to his
advances. It was then agreed that they
should meet at mid-night in the dancing
hall of the palace. Pursuant to <lbinfo n="appoint+ment"/>
appointment Kīcaka went there and <lbinfo n="attempt+ed"/>
attempted to embrace Draupadī (as he fancied
Bhīma to be owing to the darkness of
night). But the wretch was at once
seized and crushed to death by the
powerful Bhīma]. {@--Comp.@} {#--जित्#} {%<ab>m.</ab>%}
an epithet of Bhīma, the second
Pāṇḍava prince.
