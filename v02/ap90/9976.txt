of a son of Bṛhaspati. [In their
long warfare with the demons, the
gods were often times defeated, and <lbinfo n="ren+dered"/>
rendered quite helpless. But such of the
demons as would be slain in battle were
restored to life by Śukrācārya, their
preceptor, by means of a mystic charm
which he alone possessed. The gods
resolved to secure, if possible, this
charm for themselves, and induced
Kaca to go to Śukrācārya and learn
it from him by becoming his disciple.
So Kaca went to the preceptor, but the
demons killed Kaca twice lest he should
succeed in mastering the lore; but on
both occasions he was restored to life by
the sage at the intercession of Devayānī
his daughter, who had fallen in love
with the youth. Thus discomfited the
Asuras killed him a third time, burnt his
body, and mixed his ashes with Śukra's
wine; but Devayānī again begged her

being able to resist his daughter's <lbinfo n="im+portunities"/>
importunities Śukra once more performed
the charm, and, to his surprise, heard
the voice of Kaca issuing from his own
belly. To save his own life the sage taught
him the much-coveted charm, and, on
the belly of Śukra being ripped open,
Kaca performed the charm and restored
his master to life. Devayānī <lbinfo n="thencefor+ward"/>
thenceforward began to make stronger advances
of love to him, but he steadily resisted
her proposals, telling her that she was
to him as a younger sister. She thereupon
cursed him that the great charm he had
learnt would be powerless; he, in return,
cursed her that she should be sought by
no Brāhmaṇa, but would become a <lbinfo n="Ksha+triya"/>
