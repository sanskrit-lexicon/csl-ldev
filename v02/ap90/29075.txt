{#सत्राजित्#}¦ {%<ab>m.</ab>%} <ab>N.</ab> of a son of <lbinfo n="Nigh+na"/>
Nighna and father of Satyabhāmā. [He
got the {%Syamantaka%} jewel from the sun
and always wore it round his neck.
He afterwards gave it to his brother
Prasena, from whom it passed into the
hands of the monkey-chief Jāmbavat,
who got possession of it after having
killed Prasena. Kṛṣṇa, however, <lbinfo n="over+took"/>
overtook Jāmbavat and vanquished him in
fight after a long struggle. The <lbinfo n="monkey+chief"/>
monkeychief thereupon presented it along with
his daughter to Kṛṣṇa; see {#जांबवत्#}.
Kṛṣṇa then gave the jewel back to
its proper owner Satrājit, who out of
gratitude presented it along with his
daughter Satyabhāmā to him. <lbinfo n="After+wards"/>
Afterwards when Satyabhāmā was at her
father's house with the jewel, <lbinfo n="Śatadhan+van"/>
Śatadhanvan, at the instigation of a Yādava
named Akrūra who desired the jewel
for himself, killed Satrājit and gave
it to Akrūra. Śatadhanvan was <lbinfo n="after+wards"/>
afterwards killed by Kṛṣṇa, but when he
found that the jewel was with Akrūra,
he allowed him to retain it with <lbinfo n="him+self"/>
himself after having once shown it to the
people.]
