{#उलूपी#}¦ A Nāga princess. [She was
the daughter of the serpent Kauravya.
While one day she was bathing in the
Ganges, she happened to see Arjuna,
and being enamoured of his handsome
form, she managed to have him <lbinfo n="con+veyed"/>
conveyed to her home, the Pātāla, and there
induced him to take her as his wife, which
he, after considerable hesitation, <lbinfo n="con+sented"/>
consented to do. She bore him a son named
Irāvat. When Arjuna's head was cut
off by Babhruvāhana's arrow, it was with
her assistance that he was restored to
life; see Arjuna].
