{#भवभूति#}¦ The well-known author of the Mahāvīracarita,
Mālatī Mādhava, and Uttararāmacarita. He was
a native of Vidarbha and lived at the court of king
Yaśovarman of Kānyakubja, who was subdued by
Lalitāditya of Kāshmir (693-729 <ab>A. D.</ab>) <lbinfo n="Bhava+bhūti"/>
Bhavabhūti flourished therefore at the end of the 7th
century, and this date is consistent with Bāṇa's
omission of his name. All anecdotes about the
contemporaneity of Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti must
be rejected as absolute myths.
