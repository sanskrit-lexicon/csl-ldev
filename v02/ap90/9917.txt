<ab>N.</ab> of a king of Mathurā, son of
Ugrasena and enemy of Kṛṣṇa.
[He is identified with the Asura <lbinfo n="Kāla+nemi"/>
Kālanemi, and acted inimically towards
Kṛṣṇa and became his implacable foe.
The circumstance which made him so
was the following. While, after the <lbinfo n="mar+riage"/>
marriage of Devakī with Vasudeva, he was
driving the happy pair home, a heavenly
voice warned Kaṃsa that the eighth
child of Devakī would kill him. <lbinfo n="Thereup+on"/>
Thereupon he threw both of them into prison,
loaded them with strong fetters, and
kept the strictest watch over them.
He took from Devakī every child as
soon as it was born and slew it, and in
this way he disposed of her first six <lbinfo n="child+ren"/>
children. But the 7th and 8th, Balarāma
and Kṛṣṇa, were safely conveyed to
Nanda's house in spite of his vigilance,
and Kṛṣṇa grew up to be his slayer
according to the prophecy. When Kaṃsa
heard this, he was very much enraged and
sent several demons to kill Kṛṣṇa,
but he killed them all with ease. At last
he sent Akrūra to bring the boys to
Mathurā. A severe duel was fought
between Kaṃsa and Kṛṣṇa, in which
the former was slain by the latter].
