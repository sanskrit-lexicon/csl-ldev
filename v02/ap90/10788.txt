<ab>N.</ab> of Skanda (so called because he
was reared by the six Kṛttikās).
[Kārtikeya is the Mars or the god of
war of the Indian mythology. He is the
son of Śiva (but born without the direct
intervention of a woman). Most of his
epithets have reference to the <lbinfo n="circum+stances"/>
circumstances of his birth. Śiva cast his seed
into Agni (who had gone to the god in
the form of a dove while he was enjoying
Pārvatī's company), who being unable
to bear it cast it into the Ganges; (hence
Skanda is called Agnibhū, Gaṅgāputra).
It was then transferred to the six <lbinfo n="Kṛt+tikās"/>
Kṛttikās (when they went to bathe in the
Ganges), each of whom therefore <lbinfo n="conceiv+ed"/>
conceived and brought forth a son. But these
six sons were afterwards mysteriously
combined into one of extraordinary form
with six heads and twelve hands and eyes,
(hence he is called Kārtikeya, <lbinfo n="Shadāna+na"/>
Shadānana, Ṣaṇmukha &c.). According to <lbinfo n="an+other"/>
another account the seed of Śiva was cast
by the Ganges into a thicket of reeds
(Śara); whence the boy was called <lbinfo n="Śara+vaṇabhava"/>
Śaravaṇabhava, or Śarajanman. He is said
to have pierced the mountain Krauncha,
whence his name Krauñcadāraṇa. He
was the commander of the army of the
gods in their war with Tāraka, a powerful
demon <ab>q. v.</ab> whom he vanquished and slew;
and hence his names Senānī and <lbinfo n="Tāraka+jit"/>
Tārakajit. He is represented as riding a peacock.]
