{#भृगुः#}¦ {@1@} <ab>N.</ab> of a sage, regarded as
the ancestor of the family of the
Bhṛgus, and described in <ls>Ms. 1. 35</ls>
as one of the ten patriarchs created
by the first Manu; (said to be so
called because he was produced along
with flames; {#सह ज्वालाभिरुत्पन्नो#} <lbinfo n="BfgustasmA#dBfguH"/>
{#भृगुस्तस्माद्भृगुः स्मृतः#}). [On one occasion when the
sages could not agree as to which of the
three gods, Brahman, Viṣṇu and Śiva,
was best entitled to the worship of <lbinfo n="Brā+hmaṇas"/>
Brāhmaṇas, the sage Bhṛgu was sent to test
the character of the three gods. He
first went to the abode of Brahman, and,
on approaching him, purposely omitted
an obeisance. Upon this the god <lbinfo n="re+prehended"/>
reprehended him severely, but was <lbinfo n="paci+fied"/>
pacified by apologies. Next he entered the
abode of Śiva in Kailāsa, and omitted,
as before, all tokens of adoration. The
vindictive deity was enraged and would
have destroyed him, had he not <lbinfo n="conciliat+ed"/>
[Page0824-c+ 61]
conciliated him by mild words. (According to <lbinfo n="ano+ther"/>
another account, Bhṛgu was coldly <lbinfo n="receiv+ed"/>
received by Brahman, and he, therefore, <lbinfo n="curs+ed"/>
cursed him that he would receive no worship
or adoration; and condemned Śiva to
take the form of a {%Liṅga%}, as he got no
access to the deity who was engaged in
private with his wife). Lastly he went
to Viṣṇu, and finding him asleep, he
boldly gave the god a kick on his breast
which at once awoke him. Instead of
showing anger, however, the God arose,
and on seeing Bhṛgu, inquired tenderly
whether his foot was hurt, and then <lbinfo n="be+gan"/>
began to rub it gently. ‘This’, said <lbinfo n="Bhṛ+gu"/>
Bhṛgu, ‘is the mightiest god. He overtops
all by the most potent of all <lbinfo n="weapons+kindness"/>
weaponskindness and generosity’. Viṣṇu was
therefore, declared to be the god who
was best entitled to the worship of all].
