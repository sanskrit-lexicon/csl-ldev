[Page0515-a+ 58]
son of Jīmūtaketu and renowned for
his benevolent and charitable <lbinfo n="disposi+tion"/>
disposition. When his father's kingdom was
invaded by his kinsmen, he scorned
the idea of fighting with them and <lbinfo n="in+duced"/>
induced his father to leave it to those
who sought for it and to repair with
him to the Malaya mountain to lead
a holy life. It is related that there
he one day took the place of a young
serpent who was, by virtue of an <lbinfo n="agree+ment"/>
agreement, to be offered to Garuḍa as his
daily meal, and induced, by his <lbinfo n="ge+nerous"/>
generous and touching behaviour, the
enemy of serpents to give up his <lbinfo n="prac+tice"/>
practice of devouring them. The story is
very pathetically told in the play].
{#--वाहिन्#} smoke.
