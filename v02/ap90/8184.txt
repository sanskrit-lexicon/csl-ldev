{#उद्धवः#}¦ {@1@} A sacrificial fire. {@--2@} A
festival, holiday. {@--3@} <ab>N.</ab> of a <lbinfo n="Yā+dava"/>
Yādava, uncle and friend of Kṛṣṇa.
When Kṛṣṇa was taken by Akrūra
to Mathurā Uddhava was implored by
the citizens of Gokula to go and
fetch him. He was very much attached
to Kṛṣṇa. On seeing the destruction
of the Yādavas to be inevitable, he
went to Kṛṣṇa and asked him what
to do; whereupon he was told to
go to Badarikāśrama to practise
penance and to secure heaven. He
is the subject of two short poems,
{#उद्धवदूत#} and {#उद्धवसंदेश#}.
