<ab>q. v.</ab> {@--4@} <ab>N.</ab> of the daughter of <lbinfo n="Ja+naka"/>
Janaka, king of Mithilā, and wife of
Rāma. [She was so called because she
was supposed to have sprung from a
furrow made by king Janaka while
ploughing the ground to prepare it for
a sacrifice which he had instituted to
obtain progeny, and hence also her
epithets, ‘Ayonijā’, ‘Dharāputrī’ &c.
She was married to Rāma and <lbinfo n="accom+panied"/>
accompanied him to the forest. While there
she was once carried off by Rāvaṇa who
tried to violate her chastity, but she
scornfully rejected his suit. When
Rāma came to know that she was in
Laṅkā, he attacked the place, killed
Rāvaṇa and his host of demons, and
recovered Sītā. She had, however, to
pass through the terrible ordeal of fire
before she could be received by her
husband as his wife. Though thus
convinced of her chastity, he had <lbinfo n="after+wards"/>
afterwards to abandon her, when far <lbinfo n="ad+vanced"/>
advanced in pregnancy, because the people
continued to suspect her fidelity. She,
however, found a protector, in the sage
Vālmīki, at whose hermitage she was
delivered of Kuśa and Lava, and who
brought them up. She was ultimately
restored to Rāma by the sage.].
