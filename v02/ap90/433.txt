of Māruti or Hanūmat. [She was
the daughter of a monkey named <lbinfo n="Kun+jara"/>
Kunjara and wife of Kesarin, another
monkey. She was in a former birth a
celestial nymph by name Puñjikasthalī
and was born on earth owing to a curse.
One day while she was seated on the
summit of a mountain, her garment
was slightly displaced, and the God
of Wind being enamoured of her
beauty assumed a visible form, and asked
her to yield to his desires. She <lbinfo n="request+ed"/>
requested him not to violate her chastity, to
which he consented; but he told her
that she would conceive a son equal to
himself in strength and lustre by virtue
of his amorous desire fixed on her, and
then disappeared. In course of time <lbinfo n="Anja+nā"/>
Anjanā conceived and brought forth a son who

was called Māruti being the son of
Māruta.]
