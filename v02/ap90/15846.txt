preceptor of the Kauravas and
Pāṇḍavas. [Droṇa was the son of
the sage Bharadvāja, and was so called
because the seed, which fell at the sight
of a nymph called Ghṛtācī, was <lbinfo n="pre+served"/>
preserved by the sage in a droṇā. Though
a Brāhmaṇa by birth, he was <lbinfo n="well+versed"/>
wellversed in the science of arms which he
learnt from Paraśurāma. He <lbinfo n="after+wards"/>
afterwards taught the Kauravas and the <lbinfo n="Pāṇ+ḍavas"/>
Pāṇḍavas the science of arms and archery.
When, however, the great war <lbinfo n="com+menced"/>
commenced, he attached himself to the side
of the Kauravas, and after <lbinfo n="Bhī+shma"/>
Bhīshma had been mortally wounded
‘lodged in the cage of darts’ --he <lbinfo n="as+sumed"/>
assumed the command of the Kaurava
forces and maintained the struggle for
four successive days, achieving <lbinfo n="wonder+ful"/>
[Page0586-b+ 60]
wonderful exploits and killing thousands of
warriors on the Pāṇḍava side. On the
fifteenth day of the battle the fight
continued even during the night, and it
was on the morning of the 16th that
Bhīma, at the suggestion of <lbinfo n="Kṛ+shṇa"/>
Kṛshṇa, said within Droṇa's hearing
that Aśvatthāman was slain, (the
fact being that an elephant <lbinfo n="nam+ed"/>
named Aśvatthāman had fallen on the
field). Being at a loss to understand
how that could be, he appealed to
Yudhiṣṭhira, ‘the truthful’, who also,
at the advice of Kṛṣṇa, gave an <lbinfo n="eva+sive"/>
evasive reply-uttered loudly the word
Aśvatthāman and added ‘{%Gaja%} or
elephant’ in a very low tone; see  <lbinfo n="ls:Ve.+ 3. 9."/>

advantage of this circumstance, and cut
