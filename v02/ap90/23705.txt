{#ययातिः#}¦ [{#यस्य वायोरिव यातिः सर्वत्र#}
{#रथगतिर्यस्य#} <ls>Tv.</ls>] <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated
king of the lunar race, son of <lbinfo n="Na+husha"/>
Nahusha; {#ययातरिव शर्मिष्ठा भर्तुर्बहुमता भव#}
<ls>Ś. 4. 6.</ls> [He married Devayānī,
daughter of Śukra, and Śarmiṣṭhā,
daughter of the king of Asuras, was
told by her father to be her servant as
a sort of recompense for her insulting
conduct towards her on a previous <lbinfo n="oc+casion"/>
occasion; (see Devayānī.) But Yayāti
fell in love with this servant and <lbinfo n="pri+vately"/>
privately married her. Aggrieved at this
Devayānī went to her father and <lbinfo n="com+plained"/>
complained of the conduct of her husband,
on whom, therefore, Śukra inflicted
premature infirmity and old age. Yayāti,
however, propitiated him and obtained
from him permission to transfer his
decrepitude to any one who would <lbinfo n="con+sent"/>
consent to take it. He asked his five sons,
but all refused except Puru, the <lbinfo n="young+est"/>
youngest. Yayāti accordingly transferred
his infirmity to Puru, and being once
more in the prime of youth, passed his
time in the enjoyment of sensual <lbinfo n="pleas+ures"/>
pleasures. This he did for 1000 years, and
yet his desire was not satisfied. At
last, however, with a vigorous effort he
renounced his sensual life, restored his
youth to Puru, and, having made him
successor to the throne, repaired to the
woods to lead a pious life and meditate
upon the Supreme Spirit].
