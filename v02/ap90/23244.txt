{#मुच(चु)कुंदः#}¦  {@1@} <ab>N.</ab> of a tree.
{@--2@} <ab>N.</ab> of an ancient king, son of
Māndhātṛ. [For having assisted the
gods in their wars with the demons he
got, as a reward, the boon of long and
unbroken sleep. The gods also decreed
that whosoever dared to interrupt his
sleep should be burnt to ashes. When
Kṛṣṇa wanted to kill the mighty
Kālayavana, he cunningly decoyed him
to the cave of Mucukunda, and on his
entering it, he was burnt down by the
fire which emanated from the king's
eye]. {@--Comp.@} {#--प्रसादकः#} an epithet
of Kṛṣṇa.
