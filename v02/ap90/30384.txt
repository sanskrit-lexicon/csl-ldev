of Upasunda, who were sons of <lbinfo n="Ni+kumbha"/>

Creator that they would not die until
they should kill themselves. On the
strength of this boon, they grew very
oppressive and Indra had at last to
send down a lovely nymph named <lbinfo n="Ti+lottamā"/>
Tilottamā, and while quarrelling for her,
they killed each other].
