{@--2@} <ab>N.</ab> of a king, son of Aṅga and 
[Page1009-c+ 59]
said to be a descendant of Manu
Svāyambhuva. [When he became king,
he issued a proclamation prohibiting
all worship and sacrifices. The sages
strongly remonstrated with him, but
when he turned a deaf ear to their
words, they killed him with ‘blades of
consecrated Kuśa grass.’ The kingdom
was now without a ruler. So they <lbinfo n="rub+bed"/>
rubbed the thigh of the dead body, until a
Niṣāda came forth, short in stature
and with a flat face. They then rubbed
the right arm, and from it sprang the
majestic Pṛthu (see Pṛthu). <lbinfo n="Accord+ing"/>
According to the Padma Purāṇa, Veṇa began
his reign well, but subsequently fell <lbinfo n="in+to"/>
into Jaina heresy. He is also said to
have caused confusion of castes; <ab>cf.</ab>
