mother, a daughter of Kāśīrāja.
[She and her two sisters were carried off
by Bhīṣma to be the wives of <lbinfo n="Vichitra+Vīrya"/>
VichitraVīrya who had no issue. Ambā, however,
had been previously betrothed to a
king of Śāla and Bhīṣma sent her to
him; but the latter rejected her because
she had been in another man's house.
So she came back to Bhīṣma and prayed
him to accept her; but he could
not break his vow of life-long <lbinfo n="celi+bacy"/>
celibacy, and being enraged she returned
to the forest and practised austere <lbinfo n="pe+nance"/>
penance to revenge herself on Bhīṣma.
Śiva favoured her and promised her
the desired vengeance in another birth.
Afterwards she was born as <lbinfo n="Śikhaṇ+ḍinī"/>
Śikhaṇḍinī, daughter of Drupada, who came
to be called Śikhaṇḍin and <lbinfo n="be+came"/>
became the cause of Bhīṣma's death.]
