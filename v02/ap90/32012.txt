{#बाण#}¦ The well-known author of the Harṣacarita, 
[Page1192-a+ 46]
Kādambarī and Caṇḍikāśataka. Pārvatīpariṇaya
and Ratnāvalī are also ascribed to him. His date
is indisputably fixed by that of his patron <lbinfo n="Harsha+vardhana"/>
Harshavardhana of Kānyakubja who was reigning during
the whole of Hiouen Thsang's travels in India
which lasted from 629 to 645 <ab>A. D.</ab> Bāṇa must,
therefore, have lived in the latter half of the sixth
or the first half of the seventh century. The date
of Bāṇa is useful in ascertaining the dates-at least
the {%termini ad quem%} --of several writers mentioned
by him in his introduction to the Harṣa Carita.
