<L>13899<pc>0512-b<k1>जांबवत्<k2>जांबवत्
{#जांबवत्#}¦ {%<ab>m.</ab>%} <ab>N.</ab> of a king of bears
who was of signal service to Rāma
at the siege of Laṅkā. He was
also noted for his medical skill.
[This same Jāmbavat appears to have
lived up to the time of Kṛṣṇa, or
perhaps he was another being of that
time; for there was a fight between
Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavat for the  <lbinfo n="Sya+mantaka"/>
{%Syamantaka%} jewel which the latter had got
from Prasena, brother of Satrājit.
Kṛṣṇa vanquished Jāmbavat, who
placed the jewel, along with his <lbinfo n="daugh+ter"/>
daughter Jāmbavatī, at his entire <lbinfo n="dis+posal"/>
disposal].
