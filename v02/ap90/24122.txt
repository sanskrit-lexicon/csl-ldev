{#--मः#} {@1@} <ab>N.</ab> of three celebrated <lbinfo n="per+sonages"/>
personages; ({%a%}) Paraśurāma, son of
Jamadagni; ({%b%}) Balarāma, son of
Vasudeva and brother of Kṛṣṇa,
q. <ab>q. v.</ab> v.; ({%c%}) Rāmacandra or <lbinfo n="Sītā+rāma"/>
Sītārāma, son of Daśaratha and Kausalyā
and the hero of the Rāmāyaṇa;
(the word is thus derived in <lbinfo n="Purā+ṇas"/>
Purāṇas: --{#राशब्दो विश्ववचनो मश्चापीश्वरवाचकः ।#}
{#विश्वाधीनेश्वरो यो हि तेन रामः प्रकीर्तितः ॥#}).
[When quite a boy, he with his brother
was taken by Viśvāmitra, with the <lbinfo n="per+mission"/>
permission of Daśaratha, to his hermitage
to protect his sacrifices from the <lbinfo n="de+mons"/>
demons that obstructed them. Rāma <lbinfo n="kil+led"/>
killed them all with perfect ease, and <lbinfo n="re+ceived"/>
received from the sage several miraculous
missiles as a reward. He then <lbinfo n="accom+panied"/>
accompanied Viśvāmitra to the capital of <lbinfo n="Ja+naka"/>
Janaka where he married Sītā having <lbinfo n="per+formed"/>
performed the wonderful feat of bending
Śiva's bow, and then returned to <lbinfo n="Ayo+dhyā"/>
Ayodhyā. Daśaratha, seeing that Rāma was
growing fitter and fitter to rule the <lbinfo n="king+dom"/>
kingdom, resolved to install him as <lbinfo n="heir-ap+parent"/>
heir-apparent. But, on the eve of the day of
coronation, his favourite wife Kaikeyī,
at the instigation of her wicked nurse
Mantharā, asked him to fulfil the two
boons he had formerly promised to her,
by one of which she demanded the
exile of Rāma for fourteen years and
by the other the installation of her own
son Bharata as Yuvarāja. The king
was terribly shocked, and tried his best
to dissuade her from her wicked <lbinfo n="de+mands"/>
demands, but was at last obliged to yield.
The dutiful son immediately prepared
to go into exile accompanied by his
beautiful young wife Sītā and his <lbinfo n="de+voted"/>
devoted brother Lakṣmaṇa. The period
of his exile was eventful, and the two
brothers killed several powerful demons
and at last roused the jealousy of <lbinfo n="Rā+vaṇa"/>
Rāvaṇa himself. The wicked demon <lbinfo n="re+solved"/>
resolved to try Rāma by carrying off his 
[Page0911-b+ 61]
beauteous wife for whom he had <lbinfo n="con+ceived"/>
conceived an ardent passion, and <lbinfo n="accomplish+ed"/>
accomplished his purpose being assisted by <lbinfo n="Mā+rīcha"/>
Mārīcha. After several fruitless inquiries
as to her whereabouts, Hanumat <lbinfo n="ascer+tained"/>
ascertained that she was in Laṅkā and <lbinfo n="per+suaded"/>
persuaded Rāma to invade the island and
kill the ravisher. The monkeys built
a bridge across the ocean over which
Rāma with his numerous troops passed,
conquered Laṅkā, and killed Rāvaṇa
along with his whole host of demons.
Rāma, attended by his wife and friends
in battle, triumphantly returned to <lbinfo n="Ayo+dhyā"/>
Ayodhyā where he was crowned king by
Vasiṣṭha. He reigned long and <lbinfo n="righte+ously"/>
righteously and was succeeded by his son <lbinfo n="Ku+śa"/>
Kuśa. Rāma is said to be the seventh <lbinfo n="in+carnation"/>
incarnation of Viṣṇu; <ab>cf.</ab> Jayadeva:  <lbinfo n="--"/>
