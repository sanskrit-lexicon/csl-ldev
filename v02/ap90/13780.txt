{#जयद्रथः#}¦ A king of the Sindhu
district and brother-in-law of <lbinfo n="Duryo+dhana"/>
[Page0507-c+ 62]
Duryodhana, having married Duḥśalā,
daughter of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. [Once
while out on hunting, he chanced to see
Draupadī in the forest, and asked of her
food for himself and his retinue. <lbinfo n="Drau+padī"/>
Draupadī, by virtue of her magical {%sthāli%},
was able to supply him with materials
sufficient for their break-fast. <lbinfo n="Jaya+dratha"/>
Jayadratha was so much struck with this
act, as well as her personal charms, that
he asked her to elope with him. She,
of course, indignantly refused, but he
succeeded in carrying her off, as her
husbands were out on hunting. When
they returned they pursued and captured
the ravisher and released Draupadī; and
he himself was allowed to go after <lbinfo n="hav+ing"/>
having been subjected to many humiliations.
He took a leading part in compassing
the death of Abhimanyu, and met his
doom at the hands of Arjuna in the
great war.].
