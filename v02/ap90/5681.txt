{@1@} <ab>N.</ab> of the wife of Gautama.
[According to the Rāmāyaṇa she was
the first woman created by Brahmā, who
gave her to Gautama. She was seduced
by Indra who assumed the form of her
husband and so deceived her, or, <lbinfo n="accord+ing"/>
according to another version, she knew the god
and was flattered by the great God's
condescension. There is another story
which states that Indra secured the
assistance of the moon who, assuming the
form of a cock, crowed at mid-night.
This roused Gautama to his morning
devotions, and Indra went in and took
his place. Gautama, when he knew of
her seduction, expelled her from his <lbinfo n="her+mitage"/>
hermitage and cursed her to be a stone and
become invisible till she should be
touched by the feet of Dāśarathi Rāma
which would restore her to her former
shape. Rāma afterwards delivered her
from her wretched state and she was <lbinfo n="re+conciled"/>
reconciled to her husband. Ahalyā is one
of the five very chaste and pure women
whose names every one is recommended
to repeat in the morning; {#अहल्या द्रौपदी#}
{#सीता तारा मंदोदरी तथा । पंचकन्याः स्मरोन्नित्यं#}
{#महापातकनाशिनीः ॥#} Kumārila Bhaṭṭa <lbinfo n="ex+plains"/>
explains the seduction of Ahalyā as Indra's
(the sun's) carrying away the shades
of night, Ahalyā signifying night].
