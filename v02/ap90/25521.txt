{#वालिः#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated <lbinfo n="monkey+chief"/>
monkeychief, who was slain by Rāma at the
desire of Sugrīva, his younger
brother. [He is represented as a very
powerful monkey, and is said to have
placed under his arm-pit even Rāvaṇa
when he went to fight with him. <lbinfo n="Dur+ing"/>
During his absence from Kiṣkindhā to slay
the brother of Dundubhi, Sugrīva <lbinfo n="usur+ped"/>
usurped the throne considering him to be
dead, but when Vāli returned, he had to
run away to Ṛṣyamūka. Tārā, wife
of Sugrīva, was seized by Vāli, but she
was restored to her husband when Rāma
slew him.]
