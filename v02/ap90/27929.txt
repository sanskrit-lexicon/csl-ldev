[Śikhaṇḍin was originally a female,
being Amba born in the family of <lbinfo n="Dru+pada"/>
Drupada for wreaking her revenge upon <lbinfo n="Bhi+shma"/>
Bhishma; (see Amba). But from her very
birth the girl was given out as a male
child and brought up as such. In due
course she was married to the daughter
of Hiraṇyavarman, who was extremely
sorry to find that she had got a veritable
woman for her husband. Her father,
therefore, resolved to attack the kingdom
of Drupada for his having deceived him;
but Śikhaṇḍin contrived, by <lbinfo n="practis+ing"/>
practising austere penance in a forest, to <lbinfo n="ex+change"/>
exchange her sex with a Yakṣa, and thus
averted the calamity which threatened
Drupada. Afterwards in the great <lbinfo n="Bhāra+tī"/>
Bhāratī war he proved a means of killing <lbinfo n="Bhī+shma"/>
Bhīshma, who declined to fight with a <lbinfo n="wo+man"/>
woman, when Arjuna put him forward as
his hero. He was afterwards killed by
Aśvatthāman].
