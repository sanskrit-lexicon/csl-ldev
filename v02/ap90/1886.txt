{#अनुवाद्य#}¦ {%<ab>pot. p.</ab>%} {@1@} To be explained
or illustrated. {@--2@} (In <ab>gram.</ab>) To be
made the subject of an assertion (in a
sentence), opposed to {#विधेय#} which
affirms or denies something about
the subject. In a sentence the  <lbinfo n="anu#vAdya"/>
{#अनुवाद्य#} or subject which is supposed to
be already known is repeated to
mark its connection with the {#विधेय#} or
predicate and should be placed first;
{#अनुवाद्यमनुक्त्वैव न विधेयमुदीरयेत्#}; in
{#वृद्धिरादैच् आदैच्#} should have been
placed first, though the <lbinfo n="construc+tion"/>
construction is defended by Patañjali.
