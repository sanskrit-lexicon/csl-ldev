{#पुरूरवस्#}¦ {%<ab>m.</ab>%} [<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Uṇ. 4. 231</ls>]
The son of Budha and Ilā and
founder of the lunar race of kings.
[He saw the nymph Urvaśī, while <lbinfo n="de+scending"/>
descending upon earth owing to the curse of
Mitra and Varuṇa, and fell in love with
her. Urvaśī, too, was enamoured of
the king who was as renowned for <lbinfo n="per+sonal"/>
personal beauty as for truthfulness, <lbinfo n="devo+tion"/>
devotion, and generosity, and became his
wife. They lived happily together for
many days, and after she had borne him
a son, she returned to the heaven. The
king heavily mourned her loss, and she
was pleased to repeat her visits five <lbinfo n="suc+cessive"/>
successive times and bore him five sons.
But the king, who wanted her life-long
company, was not evidently satisfied
with this; and he obtained his desired
object after he had offered oblations as
directed by the Gandharvas. The story
told in Vikramorvaśīya differs in many
respects; so does the account given in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, based on a
passage in the Ṛgveda, where it is said
that Urvaśī agreed to live with <lbinfo n="Purū+ravas"/>
Purūravas on two conditions:--namely that
her two rams which she loved as children
must be kept near her bed-side and <lbinfo n="ne+ver"/>
never suffered to be carried away, and
that he must take care never to be seen
by her undressed. The Gandharvas,
however, carried away the rams, and so
Urvaśī disappeared].
