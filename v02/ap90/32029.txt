{#श्रीहर्ष#}¦ The reputed author of the Naiṣadhacarita
and of {7} or {8} other works. He is generally
placed in the latter half of the 12th century.
(Wilson says that Śrīharṣa succeeded his father
Kalaśa in 1113, and that the Ratnāvalī, a play
ascribed to the king, must have been written by
him between 1113 and 1125 the close of his reign.
But the Ratnāvalī must be regarded as a work of
an earlier date as it is largely quoted in the
Daśarūpa, a work of the last part of the 10th <lbinfo n="cen+tury"/>
century).
