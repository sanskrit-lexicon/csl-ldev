[This word first appears in the <lbinfo n="Upani+shads"/>
Upanishads as a mystic monosyllable, and is
regarded as the object of the most <lbinfo n="pro+found"/>
profound religious meditation. In the 
Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad it is said that this
syllable is all what has been, that which
is and is to be; that all is {%om%}, only {%om%}. <lbinfo n="Li+terally"/>
Literally analysed, {%om%} is taken to be made
up of three letters or quarters; the letter
{%a%} is Vaiśvānara, the spirit of waking
souls in the waking world; {%u%} is <lbinfo n="Tai+jasa"/>
Taijasa, the spirit of dreaming souls in the 
[Page0361-a+ 35]
world of dreams; and {%<ab>m.</ab>%} is Prājña, the
spirit of sleeping and undreaming souls;
and the whole {%om%} is said to be <lbinfo n="un+knowable"/>
unknowable, unspeakable, into which the
whole world passes away, blessed above
duality; (for further account see
{%Gough's Upaniṣads%} pp. 69-73). In later
times {%om%} came to be used as a mystic
name for the Hindu triad, representing
the union of the three gods {%a%} (Viṣṇu),
{%u%} (Śiva), and {%<ab>m.</ab>%} (Brahmā). It is <lbinfo n="usual+ly"/>
usually called Praṇava or Ekākṣaram].
