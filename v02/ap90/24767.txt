{#लोपा, लोपामुद्रा#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a daughter
of the king of Vidarbha and wife
of the sage Agastya. [She is said
to have been formed by the sage himself
from the most beautiful parts of <lbinfo n="differ+ent"/>
different animals so as to have a wife after
his own heart, and then secretly <lbinfo n="intro+duced"/>
introduced into the palace of the king of
Vidarbha where she grew up as his
daughter. She was afterwards married
by Agastya. He was asked by her to
acquire immense riches before he thought
of having any connection with her. The
sage accordingly first went to king <lbinfo n="Śru+tarvan"/>
Śrutarvan, and from him to several other
persons till he went to the rich demon
Ilvala and, having conquered him, got
immense wealth from him and satisfied
his wife].
