Pāṇḍava who was a son of Kuntī
by Indra and hence called {#ऐंद्रि#} also.
[Arjuna was so called because he was
‘white’ or ‘pure in actions’ ({#पृथिव्यां#} <lbinfo n="caturaM#tAyAM"/>
{#चतुरंतायां वर्णोमे दुर्लभः समः । करोमि कर्म शुद्धं च तेन#}
{#मामर्जुनं विदुः#}). He was taught the use of
arms by Droṇa and was his favourite
pupil. By his skill in arms he won <lbinfo n="Drau+padī"/>
Draupadī at her Svayaṃvara (see Draupadī).
For an involuntary transgression he
went into temporary exile and during
that time he learnt the science of arms
from Paraśurāma. He married Ulūpī, a
Nāga Princess, by whom he had a son
named Irāvat, and also Citrāṅgadā,
daughter of the king of Maṇipura, who
bore him a son named Babhruvāhana.
During this exile he visited Dvārakā,
and with the help and advice of Kṛṣṇa
succeeded in marrying Subhadrā. By
her he had a son named Abhimanyu.
Afterwards he obtained the bow Gāṇḍīva
from the god Agni whom he assisted in
burning the Khāṇḍava forest. When
Dharma, his eldest brother, lost the <lbinfo n="king+dom"/>
kingdom by gambling, and the five brothers
went into exile, he went to the <lbinfo n="Himā+layas"/>
Himālayas to propitiate the gods and to obtain
from them celestial weapons for use in the
contemplated war against the Kauravas.
There he fought with Śiva who <lbinfo n="appear+ed"/>
appeared in the disguise of a Kirāta; but when
he discovered the true character of his
adversary he worshipped him and Śiva
gave him the Pāśupatāstra. Indra,
Varuṇa, Yama and Kubera also <lbinfo n="present+ed"/>
presented him with their own weapons. In
the 13th year of their exile, the <lbinfo n="Pāṇḍa+vas"/>
Pāṇḍavas entered the service of the King of
Virāṭa and he had to act the part of a
cunuch, and music and dancing master.
In the great war with the Kauravas <lbinfo n="Ar+juna"/>
Arjuna took a very distinguished part.
He secured the assistance of <lbinfo n="Kṛsh+ṇa"/>
Kṛshṇa who acted as his charioteer and <lbinfo n="re+lated"/>
related to him the Bhagavadgītā when
on the first day of the battle he
hesitated to bend his bow against his
own kinsmen. In the course of the great
struggle he slew or vanquished several
redoubtable warriors on the side of the 
[Page0165-b+ 62]
Kauravas, such as Jayadratha, Bhīṣma,
Karṇa &c. After Yudhiṣṭhira had been
installed sovereign of Hastināpura, he <lbinfo n="re+solved"/>
resolved to perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice,
and a horse was let loose with Arjuna as
its guardian. Arjuna followed it through
many cities and countries and fought with
many kings. At the city of Maṇipura
he had to fight with his own son <lbinfo n="Babhru+vāhana"/>
Babhruvāhana and was killed; but he was <lbinfo n="restor+ed"/>
restored to life by a charm supplied by his wife
Ulūpī. He traversed the whole of Bharata
khaṇḍa and returned to Hastināpura,
loaded with spoils and tributes, and
the great horse-sacrifice was then duly
performed. He was afterwards called
by Kṛṣṇa to Dvārakā amid the intestine
struggles of the Yādavas and there he
performed the funeral ceremonies of
Vasudeva and Kṛṣṇa. Soon after this the
five Pāṇḍavas repaired to heaven having
installed Parīkṣit-the only surviving
son of Abhimanyu-on the throne of <lbinfo n="Hast+ināpura"/>
Hastināpura. Arjuna was the bravest of the
Pāṇḍavas, high-minded, generous, <lbinfo n="up+right"/>
upright, handsome and the most prominent
figure of all his brothers. He has several
appellations, such as Pārtha, Guḍākeśa,
Savyasācī, Dhanaṃjaya, Phālguna, <lbinfo n="Ki+rīṭin"/>
Kirīṭin, Jiṣṇu, Śvetavāhana, Gāṇḍīvin &c.
