His most celebrated work is the {#रसगंगाधर#} a <lbinfo n="trea+tise"/>
treatise on Rhetoric or Poetics; his other works
are {#भामिनीविलास#}, the five {%laharis%} ({#गंगा, पयूष, सुधा#},
{#अमृत, करुणा#}), and a few minor works. He is
supposed to have flourished during the time of
the Emperor Shah Jahan of Delhi. He must

and the temporary accession of Dārā to the
throne in 1658. His date, --at least, his active
career-lay, therefore, between 1620 and 1660 <ab>A. D.</ab>
