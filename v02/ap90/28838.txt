{#सगर#}¦ {%<ab>a.</ab>%} [{#गरेण विषेण सहितः#}] <lbinfo n="Poi+sonous"/>
Poisonous, having poison. {#--रः#} <ab>N.</ab>
of a king of the Solar race.
[He was a son of Bāhu and was <lbinfo n="cal+led"/>
called {%Sagara%} because he was born <lbinfo n="to+gether"/>
together with {%gara%} or poison given to
his mother by the other wife of his
father. By his wife Sumati he had
60000 sons. He successfully performed
99 sacrifices, but when he commenced the
hundredth, his sacrificial horse was
stolen by Indra and carried down to
the Pātāla. Sagara thereupon <lbinfo n="com+manded"/>
commanded his 60000 sons to search it out.
Finding no trace of the animal on earth
they began to dig down towards the
Pātāla, and in doing this they <lbinfo n="natural+ly"/>
naturally increased the boundaries of the
ocean which was therefore called  <lbinfo n="Sā+gara"/>
{%Sāgara%}; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 13. 3.</ls> Meeting with the
sage Kapila they rashly accused him
of having stolen their horse, as a
punishment for which they were <lbinfo n="in+stantly"/>
instantly reduced to ashes by that sage.
It was after several thousands of years
that Bhagīratha (<ab>q. v.</ab>) succeeded in
bringing down to the Pātāla the <lbinfo n="celes+tial"/>
celestial river Ganges to water and purify
their ashes and thus to convey their
souls to heaven].
