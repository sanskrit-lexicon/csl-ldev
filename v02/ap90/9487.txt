three semi-divine beings called
Ṛbhu, Vibhvan and Vāja, sons
of Sudhanvan, a descendant of
Aṅgiras, who were so called
from the name of the eldest son.
[Through their performance of good
works they obtained divinity, exercised
superhuman powers, and became entitled
to worship. They are supposed to
dwell in the Solar sphere, and are the
artists who formed the horses of Indra,
the carriage of the Aśvins, and the <lbinfo n="mira+culous"/>
miraculous cow of Bṛhaspati. They made
their aged parents young, and <lbinfo n="construct+ed"/>
constructed four cups at a sacrifice from the one
cup of Tvaṣṭṛ, who as the proper <lbinfo n="arti+ficer"/>
artificer of the gods, was in this respect
their rival. They appear generally as
accompanying Indra at the evening <lbinfo n="sac+rifices"/>
sacrifices. -- <ls>M. W.</ls>].
