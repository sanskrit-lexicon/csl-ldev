[According to a legend, he was
born divided in two halves which
were put together by a Rākṣasī called
Jarā, whence the boy was called 
Jarāsandha. He became king of Magadha and
Cedi after his father's death. When he
heard that Kṛṣṇa had slain his <lbinfo n="son-in+law"/>
son-inlaw Kaṃsa, he gathered a large army and
besieged Mathurā eighteen times, but
was as often repulsed. When <lbinfo n="Yudhish+ṭhira"/>
Yudhishṭhira performed the great Rājasūya
sacrifice, Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna and Bhīma
went to the capital of Jarāsaṃdha <lbinfo n="dis+guised"/>
disguised as Brāhmaṇas, chiefly with the
object of slaying their enemy and <lbinfo n="liberat+ing"/>
liberating the kings imprisoned by him. He,
however, refused to release the kings,
whereupon Bhīma challenged him to a
single combat. The challenge was <lbinfo n="ac+cepted"/>
accepted; a hard fight ensued, but <lbinfo n="Jarā+sandha"/>
Jarāsandha was at last overpowered and
slain by Bhīma].
