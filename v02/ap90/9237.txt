a famous Apsaras or nymph of <lbinfo n="In+dra"/>
Indra's heaven who became the wife of
Purūravas. [Urvaśī is frequently
mentioned in the Ṛgveda; at her sight
the seed of Mitra and Varuṇa fell down,
from which arose Agastya and Vasiṣṭha;
(see Agastya). Being cursed by Mitra
and Varuṇa she came down to the world
of mortals, and became the wife
of Purūravas, whom she chanced to see
while descending, and who made a very
favourable impression upon her mind.
She lived with him for some time, and
went up to heaven at the expiration of
her curse. Purūravas was sorely <lbinfo n="griev+ved"/>
grievved at her loss, but succeeded in <lbinfo n="secur+ing"/>
securing her company once more. She bore
him a son named Āyus, and then left
him for ever. The account given in the
Vikramorvaśīyam differs in many <lbinfo n="re+spects"/>
respects, where Indra is represented to
have favoured Purūravas with her <lbinfo n="life+long"/>
lifelong company though he had himself
cursed her. Mythologically she is said
to have sprung from the thigh of the
