slain by Indra; {#वनमुचे नमुचेररये#}
{#शिरः#} <ls>R. 9. 22.</ls> [When Indra <lbinfo n="conquer+ed"/>
conquered the Asuras, there was only one called
Namuci who strongly resisted and at
last captured him. He offered to let
Indra go provided he promised ‘not to
kill by day or by night, with wet or
dry’. Indra promised to do so and was
released, but he cut off Namuci's head
at twilight and with foam of water
(which is neither wet nor dry). <lbinfo n="Ac+cording"/>
According to another version Namuci was
a friend of Indra, and once drank up his
strength and made him quite imbecile.
The Aśvins (and Sarasvatī also, as the
story goes) then supplied Indra with a
{%Vajra%} with which he cut off the demon's
head]. {@--2@} <ab>N.</ab> of the god of love.
