{#शकारः#}¦ The brother of a king's
concubine, the brother-in-law of a
king by a wife not regularly <lbinfo n="mar+ried"/>
married ({#अनूढाभ्रातृ#}); (he is usually <lbinfo n="re+presented"/>
represented as a strange mixture of
pride, folly, and vanity, of low <lbinfo n="fa+mily"/>
family, and raised to power by reason
of his relation to the king. In the
Mṛcchakaṭikā of Śūdraka where
he plays a prominent part, his
character is well exhibited in his
lightness and frivolity of spirit,
vain-glory, constant references to
his high connection, his <lbinfo n="blunder+ing"/>
[Page1028-a+ 57]
blundering and ludicrous folly, but withal
cruelty enough to throttle the <lbinfo n="hero+ine"/>
heroine when she refused to yield to
his desire; <ls>S. D.</ls> thus defines him:
--{#मदमूर्खताभिमानी दुष्कुलतैश्वर्यसंयुक्तः ।#} <lbinfo n="so#yamanUQABrAtA"/>
{#सोयमनूढाभ्राता राज्ञः श्यालः शकार इत्युक्तः ॥#}
