<ab>N.</ab> of a demon, son of Suketu [He
was the maternal uncle and minister of
Rāvaṇa and aided him in many of his
schemes. In early times he propitiated
the god Brahman by his austere <lbinfo n="pen+ance"/>
penance, as a reward of which the splendid
island of Laṅkā was caused to be built
for him. He lived there with his <lbinfo n="broth+ers"/>
brothers for some years, but afterwards
left it, which was then occupied by <lbinfo n="Ku+bera"/>
Kubera. Afterwards when Rāvaṇa <lbinfo n="oust+ed"/>
ousted Kubera from the island, Mālyavat
returned with his relatives and lived
with him for a long time.]
