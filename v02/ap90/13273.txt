{#यस्य, पृषो°#} <ls>Tv.</ls>] {@1@} <ab>N.</ab> of a sophistical
philosopher (said to have been a
pupil of Bṛhaspati), who <lbinfo n="propound+ed"/>
propounded the grossest form of atheism
or materialism (for a summary of
the doctrines of Cārvāka, see
<ls>Sarva. S. 1.</ls>). {@--2@} <ab>N.</ab> of a Rākṣasa
described in the Mahābhārata, as
a friend of Duryodhana and an
enemy of the Pāṇḍavas. [When
Yudhiṣṭhira entered Hastināpura in
triumph, he assumed the form of a <lbinfo n="Brā+hmaṇa"/>
Brāhmaṇa and reviled him and the <lbinfo n="assem+bled"/>
assembled Brāhmaṇas, but he was soon <lbinfo n="de+tected"/>
detected, and the real Brāhmaṇas, <lbinfo n="fill+ed"/>
filled with fury, are said to have killed
him on the spot. He also tried to <lbinfo n="de+ceive"/>
deceive Yudhiṣṭhira at the end of the
great war by telling him that Bhīma
was slain by Duryodhana; see <ls>Ve. 6</ls>].
