{#सौराष्ट्र#}¦ (also called {#आनर्त#}) The modern peninsula of
Kattywar. Dvārakā is called {#आनर्तनगरी#} or {#अब्धिनगरी#}.
The old Dvārakā stood near Madhupura 95 miles
south-east of Dvārakā, and also near mount <lbinfo n="Raiva+taka"/>
Raivataka, which appears to be the same as the Girinar
hill near Junagad. Valabhi appears to have been
the next capital of the country, the ruins of which
were discovered at Bilbi 10 miles north-west of
Bhownaggar. The celebrated lake Prabhāsa was
situated in the same country and stood on the
sea-coast.
