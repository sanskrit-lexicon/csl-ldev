of a son of the demon <lbinfo n="Hiraṇya+Kaśipu"/>
HiraṇyaKaśipu. [According to the <lbinfo n="Padma+Purāṇa"/>
PadmaPurāṇa, he was a Brāhmaṇa in his <lbinfo n="pre+vious"/>
previous existence, and when born as son
of Hiraṇya-Kaśipu, he still retained his
ardent devotion to Viṣṇu. His father,
of course, did not like that his own son
should be such a devout worshipper of
his mortal enemies, the gods, and with
the object of getting rid of him, he <lbinfo n="sub+jected"/>
subjected him to a variety of cruelties;
but Prahlāda, by the favour of Viṣṇu,
was quite unscathed, and began to
preach with even greater earnestness
than before the doctrine that Viṣṇu
filled all space and was omni-present,
omni-scient, omni-potent. <lbinfo n="Hiraṇya-Ka+śipu"/>
Hiraṇya-Kaśipu in a fit of exasperation asked him
“If Viṣṇu is omni-present how do I
not see him in the pillar of this hall”?
Whereupon Prahlāda struck the pillar
with his fist (according to another
account, Hiraṇya-Kaśipu himself <lbinfo n="an+grily"/>
angrily kicked the pillar to convince his
son of the absurdity of his faith), when
Viṣṇu came out half-man and half-lion,
and tore Hiraṇya-Kaśipu to pieces. <lbinfo n="Pra+hlāda"/>
Prahlāda succeeded his father, and reigned
wisely and righteously.]
