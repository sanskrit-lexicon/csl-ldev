{#अभिमन्युः#}¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a son of Arjuna
by his wife Subhadrā, sister of <lbinfo n="Kṛ+shṇa"/>
Kṛshṇa and Balarāma; also known by
the metronymic Saubhadra. [He
was called {%Abhimanyu%} because at his
very birth he appeared to be heroic, <lbinfo n="long+armed"/>
longarmed and very fiery ({#अभिवृद्धः#} <lbinfo n="manyurya#sya"/>
{#मन्युर्यस्य#}). When the Kauravas at the advice
of Droṇa formed the peculiar <lbinfo n="battle+array"/>
battlearray called ‘Chakravyūha,’ hoping
that, as Arjuna was away, none of the
Pāṇḍavas would be able to break
through it, Abhimanyu assured his <lbinfo n="un+cles"/>
uncles that he was ready to try, if they
only assisted him. He accordingly <lbinfo n="en+tered"/>
entered the Vyūha, killed many <lbinfo n="war+riors"/>
warriors on the Kaurava side, and was for a
time more than a match even for such
veteran and elderly heroes as Droṇa,
Karṇa, Duryodhana &c. He could not,
however, hold out long against fearful
odds, and was at last overpowered and
slain. He was very handsome. He had
two wives, Vatsalā daughter of <lbinfo n="Bala+rāma"/>
Balarāma and Uttarā daughter of the king
of Virāṭa. Uttarā was pregnant when
he was slain and gave birth to a son
named Parīkṣita who succeeded to
the throne of Hastināpura].
