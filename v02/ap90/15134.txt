<ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated Prajāpati.
[He was one of the ten sons of <lbinfo n="Brah+man"/>
Brahman, being born from his right thumb,
and was the chief of the patriarchs of
mankind. He is said to have had many
daughters, 27 of whom became the wives
of the moon, thus forming the 27
lunar mansions, and 13 the wives
of Kaśyapa, becoming by him the <lbinfo n="mo+thers"/>
mothers of gods, demons, men, and <lbinfo n="ani+mals"/>
animals; see {#कश्यप#}. At one time Dakṣa
celebrated a great sacrifice, but did not
invite his daughter Satī, nor her husband
Śiva, the chief of the gods. Satī, <lbinfo n="how+ever"/>
however, went to the sacrifice, but being
greatly insulted threw herself into fire
and perished; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Ku. 1. 21.</ls> When
Śiva heard this he was very much <lbinfo n="pro+voked"/>
provoked, and, according to one account,
himself went to the sacrifice, <lbinfo n="complete+ly"/>
completely destroyed it, and pursued Dakṣa 
[Page0554-a+ 60]
who assumed the form of a deer, and
at last decapitated him. But Śiva is
said to have afterwards restored him to
life, and he thenceforward <lbinfo n="acknowledg+ed"/>
acknowledged the god's supremacy. According to
another account, Śiva, when provoked,
tore off a hair from his matted hair,
and dashed it with great force against
the ground, when lo! a powerful demon
started up and awaited his orders. He
was told to go and destroy Dakṣa's
sacrifice; whereupon the mighty
demon, attended by several demigods,
went to the sacrifice, routed the gods
and priests, and, according to one <lbinfo n="ac+count"/>
account, beheaded Dakṣa himself.]
