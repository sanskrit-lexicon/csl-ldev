Viśvakarman, the architect of the gods.
[Tvaṣṭṛ is the Vulcan of the Hindu <lbinfo n="my+thology"/>
mythology. He had a son named Triśiras
and a daughter called {#संज्ञा#}, who was
given in marriage to the son. But she
was unable to bear the severe light of
her husband, and therefore Tvaṣṭṛ
mounted the sun upon his lathe, and <lbinfo n="care+fully"/>
carefully trimmed off a part of his bright
disc; <ab>cf.</ab> {#आरोप्य चक्रभ्रमिमुष्णतेजास्त्वष्ट्रेव#} <lbinfo n="yatno#lliKito"/>
{#यत्नोल्लिखितो विभाति#}. <ls>R. 6. 32.</ls> The part
trimmed off is said to have been used by
him in forming the discus of Viṣṇu,
the Triśūla of Śiva, and some other
weapons of the gods].
