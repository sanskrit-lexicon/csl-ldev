{@Vardhamānadvāra, Vardhamānapuradvāra@}¦
 nt.: Name of the gate of Hāstina-
pura facing the town Vardhamāna.
<div n="P">Epic events: (1) Kuntī, after the
death of Pāṇḍu, came in the company of the
ascetics and her sons to Kurujāṅgala and
from there she reached the Vardhamāna-
puradvāra before entering Hāstinapura
({%sā … saṃprāptā kurujāṅgalam/vardha-%}
{%mānapuradvāraṃ āsasāda yaśasvinī//%}) 1.
117. 8 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 1. 10: {%vardha-%}
{%mānapuraṃ nāma grāmaviśeṣaḥ/tadabhi-%}
{%mukhaṃ dvāram;%} however, on 1. 126. 9
he simply says: {%vardhamānapuradvāraṃ%}
[Page561-b+ 39]
{%mukhyadvāram%}); (2) The Pāṇḍavas when
they left Hāstinapura for their exile, came
out of the Vardhamānapura gate and
went to the north ({%niryayur gajasāhvayāt/%}
{%vardhamānapuradvāreṇābhiniṣkramya te ta-%}
{%dā/udaṅmukhāḥ … prayayuḥ//%}) 3. 1. 8-9;
(3) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to repair
to the forest he left Hāstinapura coming
out of the Vardhamānadvāra ({%sa vardha-%}
{%mānadvāreṇa niryayau gajasāhvayāt%}) 15. 22.
3; (Vardhamānadvāra, according to S. K.
Belvalkar, means ‘an entrance or exit other
than the southern’, cf. {%dakṣiṇādvārahīnaṃ%}
{%tu vardhamānam udāhṛtam%} from the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā of Varāhamihira 53. 33. 36 cited by
him. Dr. Belvalkar further observes: “It is
also the name of a specific gate of Hastinā-
pura”, his note on the stanza in the Cr. Ed.
Vol. 19, p. 153. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā passage,
however, seems to mean that a house which
does not have a gate to the south is called
Vardhamāna. The editions of the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā consulted by me read in 53. 33 as
{%tadvac ca%} (or {%tasmiṃś ca%}) {%vardhamāne%}
{%dvāraṃ tu na dakṣiṇaṃ kāryam%}).
