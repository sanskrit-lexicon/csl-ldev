gether at Upaplavya of Virāṭa and settled
down there ({%tatas trayodaśe varṣe nivṛtte%}

While living there, Arjuna brought to Upa-
plavya, Janārdana, Abhimanyu and the
Dāśārhas from the Ānarta country; many
other kings also assembled there; Abhi-
manyu's marriage with Uttarā took place at
Upaplavya 4. 67. 15-19, 25, 34; the city at
that time shone as in a great festival and
[Page517-a+ 41]
became full of people who were delighted
and well nourished ({%tan mahotsavasaṃkāśaṃ%}

(3) When the Pāṇḍavas were settled in
Upaplavya ({%upaplavye niviṣṭeṣu pāṇḍaveṣu%}),
Duryodhana from Hāstinapura and Arjuna
from Upaplavya went independently to see
Vāsudeva to seek his help in the battle
as they wished to win victory 1. 2. 136 (this
is mentioned in the contents of the Udyoga-
parvan which is a reference to 5. 7. 2-20);
(4) After Duryodhana succeeded in trick-
ing Śalya and in extracting a promise from
him to fight from his side, the latter went to
Upaplavya to report to the Pāṇḍavas what
had happened 5. 8. 15; (5) When Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra was informed that the Pāṇḍavas had
resorted to Upaplavya, he sent Saṃjaya
to greet them and to seek peace with them
({%prāptān āhuḥ saṃjaya pāṇḍuputrān upa-%}

to Hāstinapura to negotiate peace with
the Kauravas: on way he had encamped
at Vṛkasthala ({%upaplavyād iha … upayāto%}

({%upaplavyāc chāntim icchañ janārdanaḥ/%}

Upaplavya to Hāstinapura people gathered
in different towns to see him 5. 82. 18;
Kṛṣṇa, without achieving his purpose,
returned to Upaplavya when the sun
arose ({%uccaiḥsūryam%}) and reported to the
Pāṇḍavas what happened at Hāstinapura

plavya, Yudhiṣṭhira offered him {%madhuparka%}
and requested him to protect Arjuna in the
battle ({%upayātam upaplavyam … eṣa bhrātā%}

request is reported earlier in the Udyoga-
parvan; a general request by Yudhiṣṭhira to
protect all the Pāṇḍavas is, however, repor-
ted at 5. 70. 4); (8) While at Upaplavya,
Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana had assured Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that victory would be on that side
which was helped by Kṛṣṇa ({%yataḥ kṛṣṇas%}
{%tato jayaḥ%}) 9. 61. 30; (such a statement
by Vyāsa is not found earlier in the Ud-
yogaparvan; however, such statement was
made by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtaraṣṭra in Hāstina-
pura 5. 66. 9 and by Nārada to Arjuna
6. 21. 12, 14; what Vyāsa told Dhṛtarāṣṭra
was {%yato dharmas tato jayaḥ%} 6. 2. 14;
(9) Kṛṣṇa, along with the Pāṇḍavas, left
Upaplavya for Kurukṣetra 9. 34. 14; when
the Pāṇḍavas with their army started for the
battlefield, Draupadī returned to Upapla-
vya; before leaving, the Pāṇḍavas made
arrangements for the defence of their base at
Upaplavya by erecting forts and stationing
troops all around ({%upaplavye tu pāñcālī%}

not agree to Kṛṣṇa's request to him to
help the Pāṇḍavas in the battle and left
from Upaplavya for a pilgrimage 9. 34. 10-
12; (11) During the battle Kṛṣṇa, at one
[Page518-a+ 40]
stage, in order to encourage Yudhiṣṭhira
reminded him that Arjuna had taken the
vow at Upaplavya to bring about the down-
fall of Bhīṣma ({%pratijñātam upaplavye yat%}

plavya; she was afflicted when she heard the
extremely sad news about the destruction of
all her sons ({%upaplavyagatā sā tu śrutvā%}
{%sumahad apriyam%}) 10. 11. 4-5; she taunt-
ingly said to Arjuna that while living with
her at Upaplavya he would happily forget
his sons who were slain rightfully (in battle)

tain Brāhmaṇa, observing vows, after seeing
Uttarā at Upaplavya had foretold that when
the Kurus were destroyed ({%parikṣīṇa%}) a
son would be born to her; the child thus
would have the nature {%parikṣit%} while he
