3. 154. 49; 3. 263. 41; due to enmity

lted (? deceived ? {%nikṛtaḥ%}) by Valin for
some reason, he lived with his four counse-
llors ({%saciva%} 3. 263. 41; 3. 264. 10, 23;
3. 266. 65) on the mountain Ṛśyamūka,
near Pampā; Hanūmant specially became
friendly with Sugrīva 3. 147. 26-27;
3. 263. 40-41; 3. 264. 6, 9, 23. {@E.@}
Meeting with Rāma: Gandharva Viśvāvasu
advised Rāma to approach Sugrīva for help
in his search for Sītā and gave him
Sugrīva's address who lived with his four
counsellors on the mountain Ṛśyamūka, near
Pampā; according to Viśvāvasu Sugrīva
knew Rāvaṇa's whereabouts 3. 263. 39-42;
[Page068-b+ 40]
Lakṣmaṇa while comforting Rāma who was
grieving over Sītā's loss suggested to meet
Sugrīva; they saw Sugrīva and four other
monkeys ({%vānarān pañca%} 3. 264. 9) on the
Ṛśyamūka mountain (also 3. 147. 31);
Sugrīva sent Hanūmant to them; having
talked with him, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
approached Sugrīva and became friends (also
3. 147. 32; 3. 264. 57, 60; 3. 266 62);
the monkeys showed to Rāma Sītā's upper
garment ({%vāsaḥ%} 3. 264. 12) which inspired
confidence in him; Rāma consecrated Sugrīva
as the chief of the monkeys ({%sugrīvaṃ plava-%}
{%gādhipam/pṛthivyāṃ vānaraiśvarye svayaṃ%}
{%rāmo 'bhyaṣecayat%} 3. 264. 13; 3. 266. 6);
Rāma promised to kill Vālin in battle and
Sugrīva promised help in getting back Sītā
(also 3. 258. 3); Sugrīva then went to
Kiṣkindhā and roared near Vālin's residence
to challenge him for a fight; when asked by
Vālin whose help Sugrīva had secured his
wife Tārā told him that Rāma had become
friend of Sugrīva since both had comparable
enemies ({%tulyārimitratāṃ prāptaḥ%} 3. 264.
21); when told further by Tārā that Sugrīva
and others were quite capable of destroying
Vālin, he suspected that Tārā loved Sugrīva;
Vālin went out of his residence and reminded
Sugrīva that formerly on many occasions he
had defeated Sugrīva but not killed him since
Sugrīva was his kinsman ({%mukto jñātir iti%}
{%jñātvā%} 3. 264. 27); Sugrīva, while alerting
Rāma, retorted that although Vālin had
deprived Sugrīva of his kingdom and his wife
he wanted to show him how much of his life-
force still remained with him ({%hṛtadārasya%}
{%me rājan hṛtarājyasya ca tvayā/kiṃ nu%}
{%jīvitasāmarthyam iti viddhi samāgatam%} 3.
264. 29); the two brothers were then engaged
in a duel; during the fight, the one could not be
[Page069-a+ 40]
distinguished from the other; hence Hanūmant
put a garland around the neck of Sugrīva;
Sugrīva with garland around his neck com-
pared with the great mountain Malaya circled
by a garland of clouds (3. 264. 34); Rāma
then could correctly aim arrow at Vālin; when
Vālin died Sugrīva got Kiṣkindhā and Tārā
(also 3. 147. 32); when Rāma lived on the
mountain Mālyavant, Sugrīva waited on him
(3. 264. 1-40; 3. 266. 1); Rāma suspected
Sugrīva to have become ungrateful ({%kṛtaghna%}
3. 266. 8) and hence not active in making
efforts to find Sītā ({%anudyukta%} 3. 266. 10);
he abused him as the very low in his family
({%kulādhama%}), foolish ({%mūḍha%}) and an
outcaste among the monkeys ({%vānarāpasada%})
3. 266. 6, 8; Rāma wanted Lakṣmaṇa to
remind Sugrīva that he had killed Vālin for
Sugrīva's sake and if he did not want to fulfil
the agreement ({%na jānīte samayapratipāda-%}
{%nam%} 3. 266. 9), Rāma would send him also
along the path of Vālin; if, on the other hand,
Sugrīva wanted to exert himself for Rāma's
cause, he should present himself before Rāma;
Lakṣmaṇa was received by Sugrīva and his
wife with all humility; with folded hands
Sugrīva informed Lakṣmaṇa that he was
neither ungrateful nor dull-witted; he had not
remained idle and had sent monkeys in all
directions in search of Sītā (also 3. 147. 32-
33); they have been asked to report back
within a month, and Rāma would get the
good news within five days; Lakṣmaṇa was
happy to learn this and he honoured Sugrīva;
the two then met Rāma on the Mālyavant;
the monkeys informed Sugrīva that Hanū-
mant, Aṅgada and other monkey-chiefs
who were sent to the south had returned
and were enjoying the Madhuvana; from
their behaviour Sugrīva inferred that they
[Page069-b+ 40]
must have been successful in their mission
and informed Rāma accordingly; Hanūmant
and others met Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and
Sugrīva and bowed to them 3. 266. 5-32;
being friend of Rāma Sugrīva had enquired
through Hanūmant about the welfare of Sītā;
Sītā had heard of Sugrīva from the Rākṣasa
Avindhya 3. 266. 62, 65. {@F.@} Part in
the war with Rāvaṇa: At the instance of
Sugrīva many monkey-chiefs came with their
troops to help Rāma in war; they encamped
near Kiṣkindhā with the consent of Sugrīva;
on an auspicious day, under a favourable
constellation, and at an approved hour ({%tithau%}
{%praśaste nakṣatre muhūrte cābhipūjīte%}
3. 267. 14), Rāma and Sugrīva marched
towards the south; when they reached the
ocean Rāma held consultations with Sugrīva
about the means to cross the ocean 3. 267. 1,
13-15, 23-24; when Vibhīṣaṇa came to
Rāma, Sugrīva suspected him of being a
spy 3. 267. 47; during the war Sugrīva
fought a duel with Virūpākṣa 3. 269. 8; when
Kumbhakarṇa struck terror in the hearts of
Tāra and the other monkey-chiefs, Sugrīva
attacked Kumbhakarṇa and struck him on
his head with a Śāla tree; but this had no
effect on the demon; Kumbhakarṇa over-
powered Sugrīva and tried to forcibly take
him away; seeing that, Lakṣmaṇa attacked
Kumbhakarṇa 3. 271. 6-10; after Kumbha-
karṇa's death Rāvaṇa sent Indrajit to kill
Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva 3. 272. 2, 5;
Sugrīva with other monkey-chiefs surrounded
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell on the
ground struck by the arrows of Indrajit;
Sugrīva rid them of arrows with the powerful
{%viśalyā%} herb and by using a divine spell ({%viśal-%}
{%yayā mahauṣadhyā divyamantraprayuktayā%}
3. 273. 6); Sugrīva with others, applied
[Page070-a+ 38]
water sent by Kubera to the eyes so that
they could see invisible beings 3. 273. 3, 6, 7.
{@G.@} After the war: Rāma crossed the ocean
back to Kiṣkindhā with Sugrīva and his
other ministers ({%yathāmukhyair amātyaiḥ%}
3. 275. 52) in the Puṣpaka {%vimāna;%} they
all then went to Ayodhyā; when Rāma was
consecrated on the throne he consented to the
departure of Sugrīva and others to their homes
3. 275. 50-59, 66. {@H.@} Comparisons: Fight
between Bhīma and Kirmīra, between Bhīma
and Jaṭāsura, and between Ghaṭotkaca and
Alāyudha compared to the one between
Vālin and Sugrīva 3. 12. 47; 3. 154. 49;
7. 153. 27.
