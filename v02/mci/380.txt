<div n="lb">3. 154. 49; 3. 263. 41; due to enmity

<div n="lb">lted (? deceived ? {%nikṛtaḥ%}) by Valin for
<div n="lb">some reason, he lived with his four counse-
<div n="lb">llors ({%saciva%} 3. 263. 41; 3. 264. 10, 23;
<div n="lb">3. 266. 65) on the mountain Ṛśyamūka,
<div n="lb">near Pampā; Hanūmant specially became
<div n="lb">friendly with Sugrīva 3. 147. 26-27;
<div n="lb">3. 263. 40-41; 3. 264. 6, 9, 23. {@E.@}
<div n="lb">Meeting with Rāma: Gandharva Viśvāvasu
<div n="lb">advised Rāma to approach Sugrīva for help
<div n="lb">in his search for Sītā and gave him
<div n="lb">Sugrīva's address who lived with his four
<div n="lb">counsellors on the mountain Ṛśyamūka, near
<div n="lb">Pampā; according to Viśvāvasu Sugrīva
<div n="lb">knew Rāvaṇa's whereabouts 3. 263. 39-42;
[Page068-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">Lakṣmaṇa while comforting Rāma who was
<div n="lb">grieving over Sītā's loss suggested to meet
<div n="lb">Sugrīva; they saw Sugrīva and four other
<div n="lb">monkeys ({%vānarān pañca%} 3. 264. 9) on the
<div n="lb">Ṛśyamūka mountain (also 3. 147. 31);
<div n="lb">Sugrīva sent Hanūmant to them; having
<div n="lb">talked with him, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
<div n="lb">approached Sugrīva and became friends (also
<div n="lb">3. 147. 32; 3. 264. 57, 60; 3. 266 62);
<div n="lb">the monkeys showed to Rāma Sītā's upper
<div n="lb">garment ({%vāsaḥ%} 3. 264. 12) which inspired
<div n="lb">confidence in him; Rāma consecrated Sugrīva
<div n="lb">as the chief of the monkeys ({%sugrīvaṃ plava-%}
<div n="lb">{%gādhipam/pṛthivyāṃ vānaraiśvarye svayaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%rāmo 'bhyaṣecayat%} 3. 264. 13; 3. 266. 6);
<div n="lb">Rāma promised to kill Vālin in battle and
<div n="lb">Sugrīva promised help in getting back Sītā
<div n="lb">(also 3. 258. 3); Sugrīva then went to
<div n="lb">Kiṣkindhā and roared near Vālin's residence
<div n="lb">to challenge him for a fight; when asked by
<div n="lb">Vālin whose help Sugrīva had secured his
<div n="lb">wife Tārā told him that Rāma had become
<div n="lb">friend of Sugrīva since both had comparable
<div n="lb">enemies ({%tulyārimitratāṃ prāptaḥ%} 3. 264.
<div n="lb">21); when told further by Tārā that Sugrīva
<div n="lb">and others were quite capable of destroying
<div n="lb">Vālin, he suspected that Tārā loved Sugrīva;
<div n="lb">Vālin went out of his residence and reminded
<div n="lb">Sugrīva that formerly on many occasions he
<div n="lb">had defeated Sugrīva but not killed him since
<div n="lb">Sugrīva was his kinsman ({%mukto jñātir iti%}
<div n="lb">{%jñātvā%} 3. 264. 27); Sugrīva, while alerting
<div n="lb">Rāma, retorted that although Vālin had
<div n="lb">deprived Sugrīva of his kingdom and his wife
<div n="lb">he wanted to show him how much of his life-
<div n="lb">force still remained with him ({%hṛtadārasya%}
<div n="lb">{%me rājan hṛtarājyasya ca tvayā/kiṃ nu%}
<div n="lb">{%jīvitasāmarthyam iti viddhi samāgatam%} 3.
<div n="lb">264. 29); the two brothers were then engaged
<div n="lb">in a duel; during the fight, the one could not be
[Page069-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">distinguished from the other; hence Hanūmant
<div n="lb">put a garland around the neck of Sugrīva;
<div n="lb">Sugrīva with garland around his neck com-
<div n="lb">pared with the great mountain Malaya circled
<div n="lb">by a garland of clouds (3. 264. 34); Rāma
<div n="lb">then could correctly aim arrow at Vālin; when
<div n="lb">Vālin died Sugrīva got Kiṣkindhā and Tārā
<div n="lb">(also 3. 147. 32); when Rāma lived on the
<div n="lb">mountain Mālyavant, Sugrīva waited on him
<div n="lb">(3. 264. 1-40; 3. 266. 1); Rāma suspected
<div n="lb">Sugrīva to have become ungrateful ({%kṛtaghna%}
<div n="lb">3. 266. 8) and hence not active in making
<div n="lb">efforts to find Sītā ({%anudyukta%} 3. 266. 10);
<div n="lb">he abused him as the very low in his family
<div n="lb">({%kulādhama%}), foolish ({%mūḍha%}) and an
<div n="lb">outcaste among the monkeys ({%vānarāpasada%})
<div n="lb">3. 266. 6, 8; Rāma wanted Lakṣmaṇa to
<div n="lb">remind Sugrīva that he had killed Vālin for
<div n="lb">Sugrīva's sake and if he did not want to fulfil
<div n="lb">the agreement ({%na jānīte samayapratipāda-%}
<div n="lb">{%nam%} 3. 266. 9), Rāma would send him also
<div n="lb">along the path of Vālin; if, on the other hand,
<div n="lb">Sugrīva wanted to exert himself for Rāma's
<div n="lb">cause, he should present himself before Rāma;
<div n="lb">Lakṣmaṇa was received by Sugrīva and his
<div n="lb">wife with all humility; with folded hands
<div n="lb">Sugrīva informed Lakṣmaṇa that he was
<div n="lb">neither ungrateful nor dull-witted; he had not
<div n="lb">remained idle and had sent monkeys in all
<div n="lb">directions in search of Sītā (also 3. 147. 32-
<div n="lb">33); they have been asked to report back
<div n="lb">within a month, and Rāma would get the
<div n="lb">good news within five days; Lakṣmaṇa was
<div n="lb">happy to learn this and he honoured Sugrīva;
<div n="lb">the two then met Rāma on the Mālyavant;
<div n="lb">the monkeys informed Sugrīva that Hanū-
<div n="lb">mant, Aṅgada and other monkey-chiefs
<div n="lb">who were sent to the south had returned
<div n="lb">and were enjoying the Madhuvana; from
<div n="lb">their behaviour Sugrīva inferred that they
[Page069-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">must have been successful in their mission
<div n="lb">and informed Rāma accordingly; Hanūmant
<div n="lb">and others met Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and
<div n="lb">Sugrīva and bowed to them 3. 266. 5-32;
<div n="lb">being friend of Rāma Sugrīva had enquired
<div n="lb">through Hanūmant about the welfare of Sītā;
<div n="lb">Sītā had heard of Sugrīva from the Rākṣasa
<div n="lb">Avindhya 3. 266. 62, 65. {@F.@} Part in
<div n="lb">the war with Rāvaṇa: At the instance of
<div n="lb">Sugrīva many monkey-chiefs came with their
<div n="lb">troops to help Rāma in war; they encamped
<div n="lb">near Kiṣkindhā with the consent of Sugrīva;
<div n="lb">on an auspicious day, under a favourable
<div n="lb">constellation, and at an approved hour ({%tithau%}
<div n="lb">{%praśaste nakṣatre muhūrte cābhipūjīte%}
<div n="lb">3. 267. 14), Rāma and Sugrīva marched
<div n="lb">towards the south; when they reached the
<div n="lb">ocean Rāma held consultations with Sugrīva
<div n="lb">about the means to cross the ocean 3. 267. 1,
<div n="lb">13-15, 23-24; when Vibhīṣaṇa came to
<div n="lb">Rāma, Sugrīva suspected him of being a
<div n="lb">spy 3. 267. 47; during the war Sugrīva
<div n="lb">fought a duel with Virūpākṣa 3. 269. 8; when
<div n="lb">Kumbhakarṇa struck terror in the hearts of
<div n="lb">Tāra and the other monkey-chiefs, Sugrīva
<div n="lb">attacked Kumbhakarṇa and struck him on
<div n="lb">his head with a Śāla tree; but this had no
<div n="lb">effect on the demon; Kumbhakarṇa over-
<div n="lb">powered Sugrīva and tried to forcibly take
<div n="lb">him away; seeing that, Lakṣmaṇa attacked
<div n="lb">Kumbhakarṇa 3. 271. 6-10; after Kumbha-
<div n="lb">karṇa's death Rāvaṇa sent Indrajit to kill
<div n="lb">Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva 3. 272. 2, 5;
<div n="lb">Sugrīva with other monkey-chiefs surrounded
<div n="lb">Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell on the
<div n="lb">ground struck by the arrows of Indrajit;
<div n="lb">Sugrīva rid them of arrows with the powerful
<div n="lb">{%viśalyā%} herb and by using a divine spell ({%viśal-%}
<div n="lb">{%yayā mahauṣadhyā divyamantraprayuktayā%}
<div n="lb">3. 273. 6); Sugrīva with others, applied
[Page070-a+ 38]
<div n="lb">water sent by Kubera to the eyes so that
<div n="lb">they could see invisible beings 3. 273. 3, 6, 7.
<div n="lb">{@G.@} After the war: Rāma crossed the ocean
<div n="lb">back to Kiṣkindhā with Sugrīva and his
<div n="lb">other ministers ({%yathāmukhyair amātyaiḥ%}
<div n="lb">3. 275. 52) in the Puṣpaka {%vimāna;%} they
<div n="lb">all then went to Ayodhyā; when Rāma was
<div n="lb">consecrated on the throne he consented to the
<div n="lb">departure of Sugrīva and others to their homes
<div n="lb">3. 275. 50-59, 66. {@H.@} Comparisons: Fight
<div n="lb">between Bhīma and Kirmīra, between Bhīma
<div n="lb">and Jaṭāsura, and between Ghaṭotkaca and
<div n="lb">Alāyudha compared to the one between
<div n="lb">Vālin and Sugrīva 3. 12. 47; 3. 154. 49;
<div n="lb">7. 153. 27.
