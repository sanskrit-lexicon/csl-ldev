<div n="lb">2. {@F.@} Role in churning of the ocean for

<div n="lb">the demons at the time of {%samudramanthana;%}

<div n="lb">the tail by all the gods; the serpent Ananta
<div n="lb">stood near Nārāyaṇa and raised up and
<div n="lb">threw down again and again the head of
<div n="lb">Vāsuki; from the mouth of Vāsuki, whose
<div n="lb">body was forcibly dragged at the time of
<div n="lb">churning, smoky winds with fire came out
<div n="lb">repeatedly which turned into clouds and lightn-
<div n="lb">ings and showered rain on the gods fatigued
<div n="lb">due to the labour of churning the ocean 1. 16.
<div n="lb">13-16. {@G.@} Vāsuki and the snake sacrifice
<div n="lb">of Janamejaya: When Vāsuki heard the curse
<div n="lb">of Kadrū, the mother of serpents, that they
<div n="lb">would be burnt in the snake sacrifice of
<div n="lb">Janamejaya (1. 13. 35), he held consultations
<div n="lb">with his brother Airāvata and other serpents
<div n="lb">to think of the remedy to nullify the curse
<div n="lb">({%śāpo 'yaṃ na bhavet katham%} 1. 33. 1); he
<div n="lb">told them that all curses had a cure, but the
<div n="lb">curse of a mother would be difficult to avert,
<div n="lb">especially when the curse was uttered within
<div n="lb">the hearing of the imperishable god (i. e.
<div n="lb">Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not
<div n="lb">stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet
<div n="lb">they had to find a way out before it was too
<div n="lb">late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of
<div n="lb">Janamejaya did not get started or, if started,
<div n="lb">it could be defeated in its purpose ({%yathā sa%}
<div n="lb">{%yajño na bhaved yathā vāpi parābhavet%} 1.
<div n="lb">33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the sugges-
<div n="lb">tions made by serpents to avoid the snake
<div n="lb">sacrifice but did not agree with any one of
<div n="lb">them; he himself had nothing better to offer,
<div n="lb">hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time
<div n="lb">Elāpatra informed Vāsuki that since Pitāmaha
<div n="lb">Brahman had prophesied that the son of the
[Page055-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">great sage Jaratkāru born of his wife having
<div n="lb">the same name would stop the snake sacrifice
<div n="lb">and free virtuous serpents from danger,
<div n="lb">Vāsuki should give in marriage his sister,
<div n="lb">who was named Jaratkāru, to the sage, when
<div n="lb">he came begging for a maiden; that would
<div n="lb">put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34.
<div n="lb">1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean,
<div n="lb">the gods had taken Vāsuki to Pitāmaha
<div n="lb">Brahman and told him that Vāsuki was very
<div n="lb">much disturbed due to the curse of his mother
<div n="lb">and that Pitāmaha should free him from his
<div n="lb">mental agony; they pointed out that Vāsuki
<div n="lb">had always acted for the benefit of the gods
<div n="lb">and for what was dear to them; Pitāmaha
<div n="lb">had then told the gods that when the occasion
<div n="lb">arrived Vāsuki should act according to the
<div n="lb">advice of Elāpatra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25;
<div n="lb">1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Vāsuki took great
<div n="lb">care of his sister Jaratkāru knowing her to be
<div n="lb">the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Vāsuki appoi-
<div n="lb">nted various serpents to watch for Jaratkāru
<div n="lb">and report to him when Jaratkāru arrived
<div n="lb">asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jarat-
<div n="lb">kāru arrived Vāsuki's attendants informed him
<div n="lb">about Jaratkāru's intention to marry a girl
<div n="lb">of his name and who was offered as alms;
<div n="lb">knowing this Vāsuki approached the sage
<div n="lb">Jaratkāru with his well-adorned sister; the
<div n="lb">sage asked Vāsuki his sister's name and also
<div n="lb">told him that even after marriage it would be
<div n="lb">Vāsuki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42.
<div n="lb">16-20; Vāsuki assured Jaratkāru that his
<div n="lb">sister had the same name as the sage and
<div n="lb">that he would support her even after marriage
<div n="lb">with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2;
<div n="lb">1. 13. 30-34; Jaratkāru then went to Vāsuki's
<div n="lb">residence and married his sister; Jaratkāru
<div n="lb">went with his wife to the shining house
<div n="lb">({%vāsagṛhaṃ śubhram%} 1. 43. 5) approved by
<div n="lb">Vāsuki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratkāru
[Page056-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">left his wife he asked her to inform Vāsuki
<div n="lb">about his departure and that he had lived
<div n="lb">happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratkāru's wife
<div n="lb">pleaded with the sage that he should not
<div n="lb">abandon her; he should realize what Vāsuki
<div n="lb">would feel if he knew that her husband had
<div n="lb">left her without blessing her with a son—
<div n="lb">that being the principal purpose of their
<div n="lb">marriage—1. 43. 32-34; when Vāsuki knew
<div n="lb">about Jaratkāru's departure he was sorry;
<div n="lb">but he would not pursue the sage fearing that
<div n="lb">he might curse him; he knew it was improper
<div n="lb">to ask his sister if she was with a child from
<div n="lb">Jaratkāru but the seriousness of the matter
<div n="lb">prompted him to do that ({%kiṃ hi kārya-%}
<div n="lb">{%garīyastvāt tatas tvāham acūcudam%} 1. 44.
<div n="lb">6); Vāsuki's sister assured him that she had
<div n="lb">conceived from Jaratkāru and that a lustrous
<div n="lb">son will be born to her; she removed his
<div n="lb">anxiety; on hearing the news Vāsuki was
<div n="lb">happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1.
<div n="lb">44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began
<div n="lb">Vāsuki was highly disturbed due to the death
<div n="lb">of a large number of serpents and feared that
<div n="lb">he himself might fall into the fire; he there-
<div n="lb">fore told his sister Jaratkāru that the time
<div n="lb">had came for her son Āstīka to intervene and
<div n="lb">stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 19-
<div n="lb">26; accordingly Jaratkāru asked her son to ful-
<div n="lb">fil the purpose for which she was married to
<div n="lb">Jaratkāru; on enquiry, Jaratkāru told Āstīka
<div n="lb">why Vāsuki gave her to the sage Jaratkāru 1.
<div n="lb">49. 1-15; Āstīka assured Vāsuki, who was
<div n="lb">terribly upset, that he would release him from
<div n="lb">the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21;
<div n="lb">when Vāsuki again expressed his anxiety by
<div n="lb">saying that he felt he was revolving, that
<div n="lb">his heart was bursting, and that he had lost
<div n="lb">sense of directions as he was afflicted by
<div n="lb">the punishment inflicted by Brahman ({%āstīka%}
<div n="lb">{%parighūrṇāmi hṛdayaṃ me vidīryate/diśaś%}
[Page056-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">{%ca na prajānāmi brahmadaṇḍanipīḍitaḥ%} 1.
<div n="lb">49. 22), Āstika reassured him that he would
<div n="lb">destroy Vāsuki's fear of {%brahmadaṇḍa%} 1. 49.
<div n="lb">22-24; later after accomplishing his difficult
<div n="lb">task Āstīka returned to his mother and
<div n="lb">maternal uncle (Vāsuki) and reported to
<div n="lb">them all that had happened at Janamejaya's
<div n="lb">snake sacrifice; all the serpents present
<div n="lb">were happy to receive the news 1. 53. 17-18.
<div n="lb">{@H.@} Functions and Events: (1) He is

<div n="lb">his {%sabhā%} without feeling fatigue 2. 9. 8, 11;
<div n="lb">(2) present among those who arrived to greet
<div n="lb">the birth of Arjuna 1. 114. 60; (3) he sided

<div n="lb">Skanda's consecration as the leader of the
