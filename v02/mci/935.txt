{@Rohiṇī@}¦ f. (sg., once pl. 12. 160. 80):
Name of a constellation.
{@A.@} Computation of time: Abhijit, youn-
ger sister of Rohiṇī, vying with her and
desiring for a higher rank went to forest to
practise austerities; Indra was then confused
in calculating time (due to the loss of
a {%nakṣatra%}) 3. 219. 8-9; hence Brahman
ordained that time ({%kāla%}) would commence
with Dhaniṣṭhā, while formerly it commenced
with Rchiṇī; this made good the loss of one
{%nakṣatra (rohiṇyādyo 'bhavat pūrvam evaṃ%}
{%saṃkhyā samābhavat)%} 3. 219. 10 (for full
citation and Nī.'s commentary see {@Abhijit@} and
{@Dhaniṣṭhā@}). {@B.@} Auspicious constellation:
The Pāṇḍavas left for Vāraṇāvata on the
eighth day of Phalguna and under the con-
stellation Rohiṇī ({%rohiṇyām%}) 1. 133. 30.
{@C.@} Religious rites: (1) {%dāna:%} Nārada
told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that in order to
be free from debt (to the manes ?) one
should, under the constellation Rohiṇī, feed
the Brāhmaṇas with known kinds of meat,
beans, cooked rice and clarified butter, and
give them milk at the end of the meal
({%rohiṇyāṃ prathitair māṃsair māṣair%}
{%annena sarpiṣā/payo 'nupānaṃ dātavyam%}
{%ānṛṇyāya dvijātaye//%} 13. 63. 6 (Nī. who
reads {%prasṛtair mārgair māṃsair%} explains
{%mārgair%} as {%mṛgasaṃbandhibhiḥ%}); (2)
{%śrāddha:%} Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1)
that one desirous of offspring should offer a
{%śrāddha%} under Rohiṇī ({%rohiṇyām%}) 13. 89.
3. {@D.@} Rohiṇī and the {%asi:%} The sword
which was created by Brahman as a weapon
(12. 160. 42) had the Rohiṇī stars for their
[Page268-b+ 40]
{%gotra (rohiṇyo gotram asya (aseḥ)%}) 12.
160. 80. {@E.@} Omens: (1) Among the
omens noticed by Vyāsa before the start of
the war there was one according to which
Śanaiścara was afflicting Rohiṇī ({%rohiṇīṃ%}
{%pīḍayann eṣa sthito rājañ śanaiścaraḥ%}) 6.
2. 32 (also cf. the next section {@F@} (3); also 5.
141. 7 ? see {@Prājāpatya<sup>2</sup>@}) (2) At the time
of Karṇa's death, Bṛhaspati was afflicting
Rohiṇī ({%bṛhaspatī rohiṇīṃ saṃprapīḍya%})
8. 68. 49. {@F.@} Similes: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira
saw Gāndhārī surrounded by her daughters-
in-law as is Rohiṇī by the stars ({%tārābhir iva%}
{%rohiṇīm%}) 2. 52. 27; (2) Lopāmudrā, sur-
rounded by her hundred {%dāsīs%} and a hundred
maidens, sat like Rohiṇī in the sky ({%rohiṇīva%}
{%divi prabho%}) 3. 94. 24; (3) Rāvaṇa draw-
ing near Sītā looked like the planet Śanaiś-
cara when it approached Rohiṇī ({%dadṛśe%}
{%rohiṇīm etya śanaiścara iva grahaḥ%}) 3.
265. 6; (4) Śāntā waited on Ṛśyaśṛnga
like Rohiṇī on Soma ({%rohiṇī somam ivānu-%}
{%kūlā%}) 3. 113. 22; (5) Sudeva wondered
when would Damayanti be united with Nala
and reach the end of her hardship as Rohiṇī
on meeting the moon ({%rohiṇī śaśino yathā%})
3. 65. 21. [See {@Prājāpatya<sup>2</sup>;@} for {@Rohiṇī@}
