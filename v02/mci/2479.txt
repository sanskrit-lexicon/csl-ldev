<div n="lb">{@B.@} Their history: (1) Yāyāvaras were the
<div n="lb">forefathers of Jaratkāru; he once saw
<div n="lb">them hanging with their heads down and
<div n="lb">holding on to a bunch of grass; a mouse
<div n="lb">residing in a hole was slowly eating up
<div n="lb">that bunch of grass; Jaratkāru addressed
<div n="lb">them; he pitied their plight for they were
<div n="lb">without food, were lean, pitiable, affli-
<div n="lb">cted and waiting for help; he showed his
<div n="lb">readiness to help them by offering them
<div n="lb">the fourth, the third, the half, of his
<div n="lb">austerities, or even all of them; Yāyāvaras
<div n="lb">told him that they were falling down in
<div n="lb">the impure hell because of the non-
<div n="lb">continuation of their line ({%saṃtāna-%}
<div n="lb">{%prakṣaya%}); his austerities would not
<div n="lb">help them; they told him they were sages
<div n="lb">known as Yāyāvaras, they had fallen
<div n="lb">down from the holy world due to the
<div n="lb">discontinuation of their line ({%saṃtāna-%}
<div n="lb">{%prakṣaya%}); their austerities had come to an
<div n="lb">end; there was no one to continue their line;
<div n="lb">the only one, named Jaratkāru, was as good
[Page851-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">as nothing for this purpose; he was versed
<div n="lb">in the Vedas but had not married and had
<div n="lb">no progeny; hence they were hanging head
<div n="lb">down in the ditch; if ever the person to
<div n="lb">whom they were addressing met Jaratkāru
<div n="lb">he should tell him their plight, ask him to
<div n="lb">marry and beget progeny; the bunch of
<div n="lb">grass to which they were clinging was
<div n="lb">their only support; if they fell down along
<div n="lb">with their ancestors, Jaratkāru too would
<div n="lb">fall down into the hell; neither austerities,
<div n="lb">nor sacrifices, nor any thing else was equal
<div n="lb">to a child 1. 41. 3-30; 1. 13. 10-30; Jarat-
<div n="lb">kāru then disclosed his identity to Yāyā-
<div n="lb">varas and asked them to punish him; they
<div n="lb">told him that fortunately he had come
<div n="lb">there and asked him the reason of his not
<div n="lb">marrying; Jaratkāru told them that by ob-
<div n="lb">serving celibacy he wanted to take his body
<div n="lb">to the next world ({%ūrdhvaretāḥ śarīraṃ vai%}
<div n="lb">{%prāpayeyam amutra vai%}); however now that
<div n="lb">he had seen their plight he had decided to
<div n="lb">marry provided he found a maiden having
<div n="lb">his name and also if he was not required to
<div n="lb">support her ({%sanāmnīṃ yady ahaṃ kanyām%}
<div n="lb">{%upalapsye kadācana … na bhareyaṃ ca%}
<div n="lb">{%yām aham%}); Jaratkāru did not get a
<div n="lb">maiden since he was old; dejected he went
<div n="lb">to the forest and addressed all beings,
<div n="lb">moving and not moving, and even those
<div n="lb">concealed, telling them that Yāyāvaras had
<div n="lb">asked him to marry and so he requested
<div n="lb">them to give him a maiden who bore his
<div n="lb">name and whom he was not required to
<div n="lb">support 1. 42. 1-15; when Jaratkāru's
<div n="lb">conditions were fulfilled, he married; when
<div n="lb">Āstīka was born, he saved Yāyāvaras and
<div n="lb">took off great burden of his ancestors;
<div n="lb">Jaratkāru went to heaven, along with his
<div n="lb">ancestors ({%pitṝṃś ca tārayām āsa saṃtatyā%}
