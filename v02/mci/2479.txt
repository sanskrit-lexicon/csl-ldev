{@B.@} Their history: (1) Yāyāvaras were the
forefathers of Jaratkāru; he once saw
them hanging with their heads down and
holding on to a bunch of grass; a mouse
residing in a hole was slowly eating up
that bunch of grass; Jaratkāru addressed
them; he pitied their plight for they were
without food, were lean, pitiable, affli-
cted and waiting for help; he showed his
readiness to help them by offering them
the fourth, the third, the half, of his
austerities, or even all of them; Yāyāvaras
told him that they were falling down in
the impure hell because of the non-
continuation of their line ({%saṃtāna-%}
{%prakṣaya%}); his austerities would not
help them; they told him they were sages
known as Yāyāvaras, they had fallen
down from the holy world due to the
discontinuation of their line ({%saṃtāna-%}
{%prakṣaya%}); their austerities had come to an
end; there was no one to continue their line;
the only one, named Jaratkāru, was as good
[Page851-a+ 40]
as nothing for this purpose; he was versed
in the Vedas but had not married and had
no progeny; hence they were hanging head
down in the ditch; if ever the person to
whom they were addressing met Jaratkāru
he should tell him their plight, ask him to
marry and beget progeny; the bunch of
grass to which they were clinging was
their only support; if they fell down along
with their ancestors, Jaratkāru too would
fall down into the hell; neither austerities,
nor sacrifices, nor any thing else was equal
to a child 1. 41. 3-30; 1. 13. 10-30; Jarat-
kāru then disclosed his identity to Yāyā-
varas and asked them to punish him; they
told him that fortunately he had come
there and asked him the reason of his not
marrying; Jaratkāru told them that by ob-
serving celibacy he wanted to take his body
to the next world ({%ūrdhvaretāḥ śarīraṃ vai%}
{%prāpayeyam amutra vai%}); however now that
he had seen their plight he had decided to
marry provided he found a maiden having
his name and also if he was not required to
support her ({%sanāmnīṃ yady ahaṃ kanyām%}
{%upalapsye kadācana … na bhareyaṃ ca%}
{%yām aham%}); Jaratkāru did not get a
maiden since he was old; dejected he went
to the forest and addressed all beings,
moving and not moving, and even those
concealed, telling them that Yāyāvaras had
asked him to marry and so he requested
them to give him a maiden who bore his
name and whom he was not required to
support 1. 42. 1-15; when Jaratkāru's
conditions were fulfilled, he married; when
Āstīka was born, he saved Yāyāvaras and
took off great burden of his ancestors;
Jaratkāru went to heaven, along with his
ancestors ({%pitṝṃś ca tārayām āsa saṃtatyā%}
