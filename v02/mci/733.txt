{@Parvasaṃgraha<sup>2</sup>@}¦ m.: Name of the 2nd
{%parvan%} in the list of a hundred sub-{%parvans%}
of the Bhārata supposed to have been made
by Vyāsa in the Parvasaṃgraha 1. 2. 34, 33,
70, 243.
<div n="P">It constitutes the second {%adhyāya%} of
the Ādiparvan in which the sub-{%parvans%} are
listed (1. 2. 34-70) and the contents of the
18 major {%parvans%} are summarized (1. 2.
71-234); thus the Parvasaṃgraha forms the
[Page190-a+ 39]
layout of the grand narrative of the Mahā-
bhārata ({%ākhyānaṃ tad idam anuttamaṃ%}
{%mahārtham vinyastaṃ mahad iha parva-%}
{%saṃgraheṇa%}) 1. 2. 243; if one first listens
to this summary of the contents, it becomes
easy for him to go through the Bhārata as
one can easily float over the extensive ocean
with a small boat 1. 2. 243.
