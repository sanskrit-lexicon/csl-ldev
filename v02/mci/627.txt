<div n="lb">Rudra ({%sthūṇākarṇa iti śaṅkukarṇākhyo%}
<div n="lb">{%rudrāvatārabhedas taddaivatyam astram%} on
<div n="lb">3. 167. 33 Bom. Ed.); it seems to have been
<div n="lb">a very important missile since it is mentioned
<div n="lb">along with the Pāśupata and the Brahmāstra
<div n="lb">5. 47. 100; 5. 139. 31 (also Aindra); Arjuna,
<div n="lb">in his message sent through Saṃjaya,
<div n="lb">threatened to use Sthūṇākarṇa against the
<div n="lb">Kaurava warriors in the war 5. 47. 100;
<div n="lb">Karṇa, too, was sure that Arjuna would use
<div n="lb">Sthūṇākarṇa in the war with the employment
<div n="lb">of proper {%mantras%} on his arrow ({%mantrās%}
<div n="lb">{%tatra bhaviṣyanti prayuktāḥ savyasācinā%}) 5.
<div n="lb">139. 31; but its use by Arjuna in the war is
<div n="lb">not recorded; on the other hand Karṇa him-
<div n="lb">self, while inciting the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">who were attacking Yudhiṣṭhira to kill him,
<div n="lb">released Sthūṇākarṇa, along with Indrajāla
<div n="lb">and Pāśupata, to overpower Yudhiṣṭhira 8.
<div n="lb">43. 20-21; outside the epic war, Arjuna used
<div n="lb">it against the Kirāta (Śiva) who swallowed it
<div n="lb">up 3. 163. 32; Arjuna used it also against
<div n="lb">the Gandharvas who had captured the
<div n="lb">Kauravas; the Gandharvas were tormented
<div n="lb">by the heat ({%dahyamānāḥ%}) of the arrows
<div n="lb">released by the use of the missile 3. 234.

<div n="lb">17-18; Balarāma had released Sthūṇākarṇa
<div n="lb">missile to repulse a very powerful {%gadā%}
<div n="lb">hurled against him and Kṛṣṇa by Jarāsandha;
<div n="lb">the {%gadā,%} when met with force by the missile,
<div n="lb">fell on the earth tearing it open and the impact

<div n="lb">Rākṣasī Jarā (who had joined the two parts
<div n="lb">of the body of Jarāsandha) lay concealed
<div n="lb">under the ground; she, together with
