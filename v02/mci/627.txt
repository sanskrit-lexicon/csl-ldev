Rudra ({%sthūṇākarṇa iti śaṅkukarṇākhyo%}
{%rudrāvatārabhedas taddaivatyam astram%} on
3. 167. 33 Bom. Ed.); it seems to have been
a very important missile since it is mentioned
along with the Pāśupata and the Brahmāstra
5. 47. 100; 5. 139. 31 (also Aindra); Arjuna,
in his message sent through Saṃjaya,
threatened to use Sthūṇākarṇa against the
Kaurava warriors in the war 5. 47. 100;
Karṇa, too, was sure that Arjuna would use
Sthūṇākarṇa in the war with the employment
of proper {%mantras%} on his arrow ({%mantrās%}
{%tatra bhaviṣyanti prayuktāḥ savyasācinā%}) 5.
139. 31; but its use by Arjuna in the war is
not recorded; on the other hand Karṇa him-
self, while inciting the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
who were attacking Yudhiṣṭhira to kill him,
released Sthūṇākarṇa, along with Indrajāla
and Pāśupata, to overpower Yudhiṣṭhira 8.
43. 20-21; outside the epic war, Arjuna used
it against the Kirāta (Śiva) who swallowed it
up 3. 163. 32; Arjuna used it also against
the Gandharvas who had captured the
Kauravas; the Gandharvas were tormented
by the heat ({%dahyamānāḥ%}) of the arrows
released by the use of the missile 3. 234.

17-18; Balarāma had released Sthūṇākarṇa
missile to repulse a very powerful {%gadā%}
hurled against him and Kṛṣṇa by Jarāsandha;
the {%gadā,%} when met with force by the missile,
fell on the earth tearing it open and the impact
produced by it shook the mountains; the
Rākṣasī Jarā (who had joined the two parts
of the body of Jarāsandha) lay concealed
under the ground; she, together with
her sons and relatives, was killed due to
the impact of the {%gadā%} and the Sthūṇākarṇa
missile on the earth 7. 156. 10-14.
