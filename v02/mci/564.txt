<div n="lb">cription: highly invincible ({%paramadur-%}
<div n="lb">{%jaya%}) 6. 19. 7; ({%ajeyo mānuṣe loke%}) 6. 19.
<div n="lb">35; immovable ({%acala%}) 6. 19. 7; difficult
<div n="lb">to penetrate ({%durbhida%}), watching on all
<div n="lb">sides ({%sarvatomukha%}), and terrible ({%ghora%})
<div n="lb">6. 19. 34. {@C.@} Use in the epic war:
<div n="lb">(1) Arjuna arranged the Pāṇḍava army
<div n="lb">according to this Vyūha on the first day of
<div n="lb">the war 6. 19. 6-7, 35; Bhīma led it
<div n="lb">({%bhīmaseno 'graṇīs teṣām%}) 6. 19. 18,
<div n="lb">({%dṛṣṭvāgrato bhīmasenam%}) 6. 19. 44,
<div n="lb">({%bhīmaseno … pracakarṣa mahat sainyam%})
<div n="lb">6. 19. 32; 6. 19. 8, 9; also in the forefront
<div n="lb">stood Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and
<div n="lb">Dhṛṣtaketu; Nakula and Sahadeva acted as
<div n="lb">the protectors of the wheels of Bhīma's
<div n="lb">chariot ({%cakrarakṣau%} 6. 19. 20), and the
<div n="lb">sons of Draupadī and Abhimanyu protected
<div n="lb">Bhīma from behind ({%pṛṣṭhagopāḥ%} 6. 19. 20);
<div n="lb">Dhṛṣṭadyumna, helped by the Prabhadrakas,
<div n="lb">offered protection to all of them (6. 19. 21);
<div n="lb">the king (Virāṭa ?), surrounded by an army,
<div n="lb">{%akṣauhiṇī%} strong, together with his brothers
<div n="lb">and sons guarded them from behind;
<div n="lb">Śikhaṇḍin, guarded by Arjuna, followed them;
<div n="lb">Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) protected Arjuna
<div n="lb">from behind ({%pṛṣṭhagopa%}) and Yudhā-
<div n="lb">manyu and Uttamaujas acted as his wheel-
<div n="lb">protectors ({%cakrarakṣau%}); Yudhiṣṭhira, with
<div n="lb">elephants, took position in the middle; the
<div n="lb">Pāñcāla king Yajñasena with an army,
<div n="lb">{%akṣauhiṇī%} strong, marched behind Virāṭa;
[Page137-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">Dhṛṣṭadyumna, having moved from
<div n="lb">his position, with his brothers and sons,
<div n="lb">protected Yudhiṣṭhira from behind; hundreds
<div n="lb">and thousands of foot-soldiers moved in the
<div n="lb">front to protect Bhīmasena, while ten thou-
<div n="lb">sand elephants followed Yudhiṣṭhira 6. 19.
<div n="lb">18-31; according to 6. 22. 1-6, where the
<div n="lb">name of the Vyūha is not mentioned but
<div n="lb">the description of which apparently applies to
<div n="lb">the arrangement of the Pāṇḍava army on the
<div n="lb">first day, Yudhiṣṭhira himself directed the
<div n="lb">contingents ({%anīkāni%}) of his army to counter
<div n="lb">the Vyūha (Sarvatobhadra) of Bhīṣma;
<div n="lb">Śikhaṇḍin's contingent stood in the middle,
<div n="lb">protected by Arjuna (also 6. 22. 14); Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb">dyumna's contingent was protected by Bhīma
<div n="lb">himself; the contingent on the right side of the
<div n="lb">Vyūha ({%anīkaṃ dakṣiṇam%}) was protected by
<div n="lb">Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki); Yudhiṣṭhira's chariot
<div n="lb">was stationed in the midst of elephants;
<div n="lb">Bhīma, along with Nakula and Sahadeva, is
<div n="lb">said to be the guard of the chariot of the hero
<div n="lb">({%vīrarathasya goptā%} i. e. Arjuna ? Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb">dyumna ?), but his position seems to be in
<div n="lb">the front of the army ({%senāgragatam%}) 6.
<div n="lb">22. 12-13; in many respects, this description
<div n="lb">of the Vyūha agrees with that of the Vajra
<div n="lb">given above (6. 19. 18-31); (2) On the
<div n="lb">seventh day of the war Yudhiṣṭhira himself
<div n="lb">used the Vajravyūha for his army (of which
<div n="lb">no details are available) to counter the
<div n="lb">Maṇḍalavyūha of the Kaurava army 6. 77. 21.
