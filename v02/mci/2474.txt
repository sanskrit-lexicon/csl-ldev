{@Mauṣṭika@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people.
<div n="P">As told by Karṇa to Śalya, according
to the Rākṣasa Kalmāṣapāda, Mauṣṭikas
were as good as the dirt of Mlecchas, and
Śaṇḍas were the dirt of Mauṣṭikas ({%mle-%}
{%cchānāṃ mauṣṭikā malam/mauṣṭikānāṃ%}
{%malaṃ śaṇḍāḥ%}) 8. 30. 70 [See P. L.

Vaidya's note on the stanza, Cr. Edn. Vol.
10, p. 687; “Mauṣṭikāḥ or Muṣṭikāḥ,
probably a sub-caste of the Mlecchas. It is
likely that the term came to be confound-
ed with Auṣṭrikāḥ (a reading of the
Central group of manuscripts), a people
who made their living by trade in
camels”].
