{%dharma (icchāmi dharmaṃ cartum)%} 13. 10.
13, and hence requested the head of the
{%āśrama (kulapati)%} to teach him and initiate
him into the ascetic practices ({%tan māṃ tvaṃ%}
{%bhagavan vaktuṃ pravrājayitum arhasi%}) 13.
10. 13 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 14: {%pravrāja-%}
{%yitum vidhivat svocitaṃ karma tyājayitum%});
the head of the {%āśrama%} told him that it was
not possible for him to be an ascetic ({%pra-%}
{%vrājaka%}) and live in the {%āśrama (na śakyam%}
{%iha śūdreṇa liṅgam āśritya vartitum)%} 13.
10. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 16: {%liṅgaṃ%}
{%saṃnyāsacihnam%}); so the Śūdra went some
distance from the {%āśramapada%} and constru-
cted a cottage for himself; he put up an
altar, levelled the ground, and raised abodes
for gods ({%gatvāśramapadād dūram uṭajaṃ%}
{%kṛtavāṃs tu saḥ/tatra vediṃ ca bhūmiṃ%}
{%ca devatāyatanāni ca/niveśya/%}) 13. 10. 17
(Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 20:
{%vedīṃ pūjārthaṃ, bhūmiṃ śayanādyartham%});
a certain ascetic ({%muni, ṛṣi, tāpasa%}) who
acted as a priest for the rites of manes
({%pitṛkārya%}) of this Śūdra became in his
next birth the Purohita of the king (viz.
the Śūdra who was born as a king); when
the Purohita was told by the king about his
past life he went to the same Brahmāśrama
to practise austerities; he obtained great
perfection ({%siddhiṃ parāṃ prāptaḥ%}) and
was respected by the residents of the
{%āśrama%} 13. 10. 10-59.
