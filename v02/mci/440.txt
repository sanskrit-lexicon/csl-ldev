({%astra%}).
<div n="P">One of the eight missiles known to
Arjuna; enumerated by Rāma Jāmadagnya
to Duryodhana; when struck by any one of
these eight missiles the victim died, or
became insane, or lost consciousness, or he
slept, or jumped up, vomited, passed urine,
or he wept or laughed incessantly; (of these
different effects, perhaps Akṣisaṃtarjana only
induced the victim to go to sleep ?) 5. 94.
