[Page033-b+ 40]
mitra, while on a visit to Vasiṣṭha, was sur-
prised at the qualities of Nandinī; he asked
Vasiṣṭha to give her to him in exchange for an
{%arbuda%} cows or even his kingdom; Vasiṣṭha
declined to part with Nandinī as she was
needed for the worship of gods, guests and
manes; Viśvāmitra then declared his intention
to forcibly take her away; Viśvāmitra and
his army used force to take her away; they
beat her with whips, rods and stones and
bound her calf with a rope; lowing she appro-
ached Vasiṣṭha; when she knew that Vasiṣṭha
would not do anything to stop Viśvāmitra
out of forbearance and also that his non-
intervention did not mean he wanted to
forsake her she assumed a terrible form
({%prababhau ghoradarśanā%}) and produced
from parts of her body and excretions various
tribes like Pahlavas, Śakas, Śabaras and
others equipped with weapons; Viśvāmitra's
army was routed and his attempt to take
away Nandinī was foiled 1. 165. 2-40.
