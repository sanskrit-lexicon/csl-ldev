(1) Yudhiṣṭhira asked Bhīṣma how
the people of the Śvetadvīpa were born
and what was the kind of life they were
going to obtain after death ({%kathaṃ te%}
{%puruṣā jātāḥ kā teṣāṃ gatir uttamā%}) 12.
322. 13; thereupon Bhīṣma replied to his
question in details starting with the story
of king Uparicara 12. 322. 16 ff.; Bhīṣma
also told Yudhiṣṭhira how Nārada went to
Śvetadvīpa 12. 324. 39; (2) Janamejaya
asked Vaiśaṃpāyana why Nārada return-
ed from the Śvetadvīpa to the Badarī
{%āśrama%} to see Nara and Nārāyaṇa, how
long he stayed there, and what were the
questions he asked to those two Ṛṣis 12.
331. 15-18; thereupon Vaiśaṃpāyana re-
plied to his question in details 12. 331. 19 ff.
{@E.@} Past events: (1) Nārada standing on
a peak of mountain Meru saw the Śveta-
dvīpa in the north-west direction as a
wonderful spectacle 12. 322. 7-8; Nārada
reached the Śvetadvīpa and saw the people
there; he respected them by bowing
down and they honoured him mentally
({%pūjayām āsa śirasā manasā taiś ca pūji-%}
{%taḥ%}) 12. 325. 1-2; Bhagavān appeared
[Page895-b+ 40]
before Nārada, but told him to leave the
island immediately so that no disturbance
was caused to the contemplations of the
people of the Śvetadvīpa ({%gaccha nārada%}
{%māciram// … ekāgrāś cintayeyur māṃ%}
{%naiṣāṃ vighno bhaved iti%}) 12. 326. 17-18;
12. 331. 13; he left Śvetadvīpa and went
to mount Meru and from there to Gandha-
mādana to reach Badarī 12. 331. 20-22;
(also see the two epic events above);
Nārada told Nara and Nārāyaṇa that he
saw in Śvetadvīpa the people residing there
12. 331. 29-30; Nārāyaṇa asked Nārada if
he saw in Śvetadvīpa the Bhagavān who was
their (i. e. of Nara and Nārāyaṇa) higher
{%prakṛti (api … sa bhagavān … śvetadvīpe%}
{%tvayā dṛṣṭa āvayoḥ prakṛtiḥ parā)%} 12. 331.
35; Nārada replied that he did and also
told them he saw the white people who
were devoid of all sense-organs; as directed
by Bhagavān he returned from Śvetadvīpa
12. 331. 36, 41, 51; 12. 332. 1; Nara and
Nārāyaṇa then told Nārada that they too
had seen him (Nārada) meeting the Bhaga-
vān himself in Śvetadvīpa and had heard
his conversation with him ({%āvābhyām api%}
{%dṛṣṭas tvaṃ śvetadvīpe … /samāgato bhaga-%}
{%vatā saṃjalpaṃ kṛtavān yathā//%}) 12. 332.
22; (2) A noncorporeal voice told Ekata,
Dvita and Trita, who were practising severe
austerities on mountain Meru to go to
Śvetadvīpa where the Bhagavān had mani-
fested himself ({%gacchadhvaṃ tatra%}) (i. e.
Śvetadvīpa) {%munayas tatrātmā me pra-%}
{%kāśitaḥ%}) 12. 323. 21-23, 26; they reached
the Śvetadvīpa by following the way told
to them by the noncorporeal voice; having
reached the island, however, their eyes
were blinded and they could not see any
man ({%prāpya śvetaṃ mahādvīpaṃ … tato%}
[Page896-a+ 40]
{%no dṛṣṭiviṣayas tadā pratihato 'bhavat%}) 12.
323. 27-28; when Ekata, Dvita and Trita
further practised austerities for a hundred
years they were able to see the people of
the Śveta island; they had folded their
hands and, facing north-east, they did the
{%japa%} of Brahman; that {%japa%} was mental
({%nityāñjalikṛtān brahma japataḥ prāgudaṅ-%}
{%mukhān/mānaso nāma sa japo japyate%}
{%tair mahātmabhiḥ//%}) 12. 323. 32; suddenly
they saw lustre equal to that of a thousand
suns; the people of the island together be-
gan to run quickly, folding their hands and,
delighted, they continued to say {%‘namas’;%}
when they were thus showing their reve-
rence, we heard a loud sound ({%tato 'bhi-%}
{%vadatāṃ teṣām aśrauṣma vipulaṃ dhvanim%})
12. 323. 37; Ekata, Dvita and Trita were
not able to see anything, but they could
hear the praise of Bhagavān; at that time
wind blew heavenly flowers and plants
suitable for offerings; with that, people
gave offering to Hari ({%baliḥ kilopahriyate%}
{%tasya devasya tair naraiḥ%}); indeed, the god
himself had arrived there when they were
uttering sounds; from among those thou-
sands of men no one welcomed them
mentally, nor by looking at them; no one
thought of them and hence they were
worried ({%etasminn antare vāyuḥ … divyāny%}

{%nāsmāsu dadhire bhāvam%}) 12. 323. 38-45;
a non-corporeal being then told them that
they had already seen the white people of
the island and that seeing them was as
good as seeing the chief god; they should
therefore quit the island without delay
[Page896-b+ 39]

Nārada that Ekata, Dvita and Trita had
come to the Śveta island desirous of his
{%darśana,%} but they could not see him ({%imaṃ%}
{%deśam anuprāptā mama darśanalālasāḥ%})
12. 326. 11; (3) Vaiśaṃpāyana informed
Janamejaya that Nārada had told the
Sātvata {%dharma%} to Vyāsa, which was, also
called the {%dharma%} of the Ekāntins, followed
by the white ascetics ({%dharmaḥ sātvato … /%}

probably to be identified with the people
of the Śvetadvīpa. Nī., however, on 12.
