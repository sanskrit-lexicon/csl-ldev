{@Pūjanī@}¦ f.: A female bird ({%śakunī%}
<div n="lb">12. 137. 5; {%śakunikā%} 12. 137. 108).
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Residence: She lived for a long
<div n="lb">time in the inner apartments ({%antaḥpura-%}
<div n="lb">{%vāsinī%}) of king Brahmadatta Kāmpilya 12.
<div n="lb">137. 5. {@B.@} Qualities: Although born
<div n="lb">in the lower species she knew everything; she
<div n="lb">was conversant with {%dharma%} and, like a {%jīva-%}
<div n="lb">{%jīvaka%} (a bird who helps telling future ?;
<div n="lb">one who prophesies with the help of such
<div n="lb">a bird ? Nīla {%jīvajīvakaḥ śākunikaḥ sa hi%}
<div n="lb">{%ayaṃ pakṣī asyāṃ diśi lābhaṃ asyām%}
<div n="lb">{%alābhaṃ diśatīti varṇayati/pakṣiviśesa ity%}
<div n="lb">{%anye%} on 12. 139. 6 Bom. Ed.), understood
<div n="lb">the meaning of the cries of all beings
<div n="lb">({%rutajñā sarvabhūtānāṃ yathā vai jīvajīva-%}
<div n="lb">{%kaḥ%}) 12. 137. 6. {@C.@} Her son's death:
<div n="lb">Her lustrous son grew in the palace with
<div n="lb">the king's son. Pūjanī used to get from the
<div n="lb">seashore two fruits, one for her son and one
<div n="lb">for the prince; one day the prince, while play-
<div n="lb">ing with the young bird, killed him in a
<div n="lb">secluded place; when Pūjanī returned with
<div n="lb">two fruits she found her young one dead; she
<div n="lb">lamented over her son's loss and blamed the
<div n="lb">Kṣatriyas who deserved no trust; she decided
[Page041-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">to take revenge and pierced the eyes of the
<div n="lb">prince with her talons; she said that a sinful
<div n="lb">act, deliberately committed, returned quickly
<div n="lb">on the doer and that taking revenge did not
<div n="lb">destroy one's good and bad (?) acts ({%iccha-%}
<div n="lb">{%yaiva kṛtaṃ pāpaṃ sadya evopasarpati/%}
<div n="lb">{%kṛtapratikriyaṃ teṣāṃ na naśyati śubhā-%}
<div n="lb">{%śubham%}) 12. 137. 7-19. {@D.@} King Brahma-
<div n="lb">datta's dialogue with Pūjanī: Brahmadatta
<div n="lb">asked Pūjanī to continue to live with him
<div n="lb">since she had already retaliated for the
<div n="lb">misdeed of the prince; Pūjanī did not agree
<div n="lb">with the king saying that wise men recom-
<div n="lb">mended abandoning the place where misdeed
<div n="lb">was committed; enmities, once arisen, never
<div n="lb">subsided, hence no trust should be reposed
<div n="lb">in the enemy; the purpose for which she
<div n="lb">lived in the palace was no longer there;
<div n="lb">spirited men should abandon the place
<div n="lb">where after receiving honour they are dis-
<div n="lb">honoured; she said to the king: “I have
<div n="lb">lived here long enough; now I go, may you
<div n="lb">be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded
<div n="lb">with her saying that when some one retali-
<div n="lb">ated nothing wrong was committed and there-
<div n="lb">fore Pūjanī should stay on; Pūjanī did
<div n="lb">not consent saying that enmities never passed
<div n="lb">off ({%nāsti vairam upakrāntam%} 12. 137. 34);
<div n="lb">no one should feel secure with the thought
<div n="lb">that reconciliation had come about; she
<div n="lb">pointed out to the king five causes of
<div n="lb">enmity: women, (ownership of) house, (bad)
<div n="lb">speech, rivalry, and misdeed ({%strīkṛtaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%vāstujaṃ vāgjaṃ sasapatnāparādhajam%} 12.
<div n="lb">137. 38); she lived with the king as long as
<div n="lb">nothing wrong happened; once that happened,
<div n="lb">she could trust the king no more; the king
<div n="lb">then put the entire responsibility of what had
<div n="lb">happened on Time (Kāla); since men were
<div n="lb">driven to act by Time nobody did anything
<div n="lb">wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pūjanī
[Page041-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">for her act, so should she forgive him for
<div n="lb">what (the prince) had done; Pūjanī retorted
<div n="lb">saying that if Kāla was to be blamed for
<div n="lb">everything, why did men seek to take revenge ?
<div n="lb">Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each
<div n="lb">other ? Why did men give and take medicines
<div n="lb">during illness ? She injured the king's son
<div n="lb">who had killed her son; now it was the king's
<div n="lb">turn to capture her; men wanted birds
<div n="lb">either for eating or for sporting; there was no
<div n="lb">third ground for the two to come together; if
<div n="lb">Pūjanī were to stay their enmity would
<div n="lb">be revived every time she remembered her
<div n="lb">son; she then recited two {%gāthās%} which
<div n="lb">Uśanas had recited for Prahrāda (12. 137.
<div n="lb">67-68); the purport of the {%gāthās%} was that
<div n="lb">one who trusted the words of enemies was
<div n="lb">killed like a honey (-seeker ?) who was killed
<div n="lb">in a well) covered with dry grass ({%te%}
<div n="lb">{%śraddadhānā vadhyante madhu śuṣkatṛṇair%}
<div n="lb">{%yathā/%} Nī. {%śatruṇā darśitaṃ puraḥsthitaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%madhu śraddadhānā śuṣkatṛṇaiś channe%}
<div n="lb">{%prapāte yathā patanti tadvad ete ity arthaḥ%}
<div n="lb">on 12. 139. 71 Bom. Ed.); enmities conti-
<div n="lb">nued because they were told to successive
<div n="lb">generations; when Brahmadatta further
<div n="lb">argued that trust had to be placed some-
<div n="lb">where to achieve one's objective or else one
<div n="lb">would live like a dead person, Pūjanī
<div n="lb">replied that if a person continued to run
<div n="lb">with injured feet, his feet got more hurt;
<div n="lb">she gave the king a long lecture on how one
<div n="lb">should guard one's interest by remaining
<div n="lb">alert and with constant exertion; one should
<div n="lb">leave the place where one was dishonoured;
<div n="lb">since Brahmadatta's son had done something
<div n="lb">which could not be repaired she had to leave
<div n="lb">the place; she also lectured on the king's
<div n="lb">duties (offering protection to subjects and
<div n="lb">not torturing them by levying heavy taxes);
<div n="lb">having said all that Pūjanī left (12. 137.
[Page042-a+ 38]
<div n="lb">70-108); this conversation ({%saha bhāṣītam%})
<div n="lb">between Brahmadatta and Pūjanī narrated
<div n="lb">by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (12. 137. 4-109).
