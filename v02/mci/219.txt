{@Pūjanī@}¦ f.: A female bird ({%śakunī%}
12. 137. 5; {%śakunikā%} 12. 137. 108).
{@A.@} Residence: She lived for a long
time in the inner apartments ({%antaḥpura-%}
{%vāsinī%}) of king Brahmadatta Kāmpilya 12.
137. 5. {@B.@} Qualities: Although born
in the lower species she knew everything; she
was conversant with {%dharma%} and, like a {%jīva-%}
{%jīvaka%} (a bird who helps telling future ?;
one who prophesies with the help of such
a bird ? Nīla {%jīvajīvakaḥ śākunikaḥ sa hi%}

{%anye%} on 12. 139. 6 Bom. Ed.), understood
the meaning of the cries of all beings
({%rutajñā sarvabhūtānāṃ yathā vai jīvajīva-%}
{%kaḥ%}) 12. 137. 6. {@C.@} Her son's death:
Her lustrous son grew in the palace with
the king's son. Pūjanī used to get from the
seashore two fruits, one for her son and one
for the prince; one day the prince, while play-
ing with the young bird, killed him in a
secluded place; when Pūjanī returned with
two fruits she found her young one dead; she
lamented over her son's loss and blamed the
Kṣatriyas who deserved no trust; she decided
[Page041-a+ 41]
to take revenge and pierced the eyes of the
prince with her talons; she said that a sinful
act, deliberately committed, returned quickly
on the doer and that taking revenge did not
destroy one's good and bad (?) acts ({%iccha-%}
{%yaiva kṛtaṃ pāpaṃ sadya evopasarpati/%}
{%kṛtapratikriyaṃ teṣāṃ na naśyati śubhā-%}
{%śubham%}) 12. 137. 7-19. {@D.@} King Brahma-
datta's dialogue with Pūjanī: Brahmadatta
asked Pūjanī to continue to live with him
since she had already retaliated for the
misdeed of the prince; Pūjanī did not agree
with the king saying that wise men recom-
mended abandoning the place where misdeed
was committed; enmities, once arisen, never
subsided, hence no trust should be reposed
in the enemy; the purpose for which she
lived in the palace was no longer there;
spirited men should abandon the place
where after receiving honour they are dis-
honoured; she said to the king: “I have
lived here long enough; now I go, may you
be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded
with her saying that when some one retali-
ated nothing wrong was committed and there-
fore Pūjanī should stay on; Pūjanī did
not consent saying that enmities never passed
off ({%nāsti vairam upakrāntam%} 12. 137. 34);
no one should feel secure with the thought
that reconciliation had come about; she
pointed out to the king five causes of
enmity: women, (ownership of) house, (bad)
speech, rivalry, and misdeed ({%strīkṛtaṃ%}
{%vāstujaṃ vāgjaṃ sasapatnāparādhajam%} 12.
137. 38); she lived with the king as long as
nothing wrong happened; once that happened,
she could trust the king no more; the king
then put the entire responsibility of what had
happened on Time (Kāla); since men were
driven to act by Time nobody did anything
wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pūjanī
[Page041-b+ 41]
for her act, so should she forgive him for
what (the prince) had done; Pūjanī retorted
saying that if Kāla was to be blamed for
everything, why did men seek to take revenge ?
Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each
other ? Why did men give and take medicines
during illness ? She injured the king's son
who had killed her son; now it was the king's
turn to capture her; men wanted birds
either for eating or for sporting; there was no
third ground for the two to come together; if
Pūjanī were to stay their enmity would
be revived every time she remembered her
son; she then recited two {%gāthās%} which
Uśanas had recited for Prahrāda (12. 137.
67-68); the purport of the {%gāthās%} was that
one who trusted the words of enemies was
killed like a honey (-seeker ?) who was killed
in a well) covered with dry grass ({%te%}
{%śraddadhānā vadhyante madhu śuṣkatṛṇair%}
{%yathā/%} Nī. {%śatruṇā darśitaṃ puraḥsthitaṃ%}
{%madhu śraddadhānā śuṣkatṛṇaiś channe%}
{%prapāte yathā patanti tadvad ete ity arthaḥ%}
on 12. 139. 71 Bom. Ed.); enmities conti-
nued because they were told to successive
generations; when Brahmadatta further
argued that trust had to be placed some-
where to achieve one's objective or else one
would live like a dead person, Pūjanī
replied that if a person continued to run
with injured feet, his feet got more hurt;
she gave the king a long lecture on how one
should guard one's interest by remaining
alert and with constant exertion; one should
leave the place where one was dishonoured;
since Brahmadatta's son had done something
which could not be repaired she had to leave
the place; she also lectured on the king's
duties (offering protection to subjects and
not torturing them by levying heavy taxes);
having said all that Pūjanī left (12. 137.
[Page042-a+ 38]
70-108); this conversation ({%saha bhāṣītam%})
between Brahmadatta and Pūjanī narrated
by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (12. 137. 4-109).
