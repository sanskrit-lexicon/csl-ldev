ṣṭhira that at the time of the game of dice
he had gone to Saubha, the town of Śālva,
to kill him ({%śālvasya nagaraṃ saubhaṃ gato%}
{%'ham%}) 3. 15. 2; in the absence of Kṛṣṇa,
Śālva, enraged at the killing of Śiśupāla, rode
his Saubha, moving at will, and attacked
Dvārakā ({%āgataḥ kāmagaṃ saubham āru-%}
{%hya%}) 3. 15. 5-7; when Śālva did not find
Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā, he reviled Kṛṣṇa, rode
his Saubha, and flew up in the sky ({%divam%}
{%āsthitaḥ/kāmagena ca saubhena kṣiptvā%}

returned to Dvārakā from Indraprastha, left
for the destruction of Saubha ({%tataḥ sau-%}

ṣṭhira then requested Kṛṣṇa to tell him the
downfall of Saubha in detail ({%vistareṇa … %}
{%saubhasya vadham ācakṣva%}) 3. 16. 1; when
Śālva reached Dvārakā, he besieged it on
all sides, arranging his sky-moving town (all
around) in battle positions ({%arundhat tāṃ%}

{%viśeṣeṇa sthāpayitvā%}); Dvārakā was well
protected when Śālva attacked it ({%tadā%}
{%saubhasamāgame%}) 3. 16. 19; when Śālva's
heroes were killed in battle, he (went
back; but) came again in his Saubha,
[Page582-a+ 40]
moving at will, to attack Dvārakā ({%kāma-%}
{%gena sa saubhena śālvaḥ punar upāgamat%})
3. 17. 27; the army in Dvārakā was dis-
tressed seeing Śālva descending from sky
on the earth ({%dṛṣṭvā śālvaṃ … saubhasthaṃ%}
{%pṛthivīgatam%}) 3. 17. 28; Pradyumna assu-
red his army that he would defeat in battle
the Saubha with its king (Śālva) ({%na bhīḥ%}
{%kāryā/saubharāḍ adya naśyati/ … sasau-%}
{%bho vinaśiṣyati%}) 3. 17. 30-32; Pradyumna
confounded all demons of the Saubha
with quickly shifting the bow from palm
to palm ({%sa … cāpaṃ viharan vai talāt%}

Pradyumna, Śālva abandoned Dvārakā,
rode his Saubha and flew up in the sky
({%saubham āsthāya … divam ācakrame%}) 3.
20. 27; when Kṛṣṇa, on his return to Dvā-
rakā, learnt about the attack on Dvārakā
by Śālva, he vowed to destroy the town
Saubha along with Śālva ({%saśālvaṃ saubha-%}
{%nagaraṃ hantā%}) 3. 21. 9; when he learnt that
Sālva, in his Saubha, had gone back, he
pursued him ({%prayātaṃ saubham āsthāya%})
3. 21. 15; Kṛṣṇa left for the destruction of
Saubha after asking Sātyaki and others to
protect Dvārakā ({%teṣu rakṣāṃ samādhāya%}
{%prayātaḥ saubhapātane%}) 3. 22. 17; Śālva
then in his Saubha, had taken refuge in
the bay of the ocean and remained hidden
in its navel ({%tataḥ sāgaram āsādya kukṣau%}

the town (Saubha) ({%puraṃ nāsādyata%}
{%śaraiḥ%}) 3. 21. 18; the Saubha though close
to the sky appeared as if it was at a dis-
tance of only a {%krośa%} from Kṛṣṇa ({%khe%}

pierced the bodies of the Dānavas, there
was a loud din in the Saubha ({%tato hala-%}
{%halāśabdaḥ saubhamadhye vyavardhata%}) 3.
21. 28; Kṛṣṇa saw Vasudeva falling down
from Saubha: but after some time, Saubha,
Śālva and Vasudeva disappeared; all this
was {%māyā%} of Śālva ({%apaśyaṃ … prapatan-%}

30; Kṛṣṇa then felled down the heads of
the demons from the Saubha ({%saubhāc%}
{%chirāṃsi vibudhadviṣām%}) 3. 23. 1; the
Saubha then disappeared due to {%māyā%} of
Śālva ({%tato nādṛśyata tadā saubhaṃ … /%}
{%antarhitaṃ māyayābhūt%}) 3. 23. 3; Saubha,
moving at will, went to Prāgjyotiṣa and, (on
its return), was seen again ({%tataḥ prāgjyoti-%}

attention to Śālva, the ruler of Saubha ({%paśya%}
{% … śālvaṃ saubhapatiṃ sthitam%}) 3. 23. 20;
Kṛṣṇa then decided to kill Śālva and bring
down Saubha ({%yuddhe matim adhārayam/%}
{%vadhāya śālvarājasya saubhasya ca nipāta-%}
{%ne//%}) 3. 23. 27; he then employed the {%āgneya%}
{%astra%} on his {%cakra%} and commanded “kill
Saubha and my enemies” ({%āgneyam astram%}

{%svavīryeṇa ye cātra ripavo mama/ity%}
{%uktvā … tasmai prāhiṇavam%}) 3. 23. 28. 31;
the {%cakra%} struck the town Saubha and cut
it into two in the middle; when the Saubha
fell down the {%cakra%} came back to Kṛṣṇa's
hand ({%tat samāsādya nagaraṃ saubham … %}

{%madhyena pāṭayām āsa … /dvidhā kṛtaṃ%}
{%tataḥ saubham … tasmin nipatite saubhe%}
{%cakram āgāt karaṃ mama%}) 3. 23. 33-35; see-
ing the Saubha on fire, the women (of the
Dānavas) fled 3. 23. 39; Kṛṣṇa steadied his
chariot near the Saubha and blew his conch
({%tato 'haṃ samavasthāpya rathaṃ saubha-%}
{%samīpataḥ śaṅkhaṃ pradhmāpya%}) 3. 23. 38;
after killing Śālva and bringing down the
Saubha, Kṛṣṇa returned to the Ānarta
country ({%evaṃ nihatya samare śālvaṃ sau-%}
{%bhaṃ nipātya ca/ānartān punar āgamya%})
3. 23. 40; the downfall of Saubha and the
killing of Śālva by Kṛṣṇa is referred to
at various places: (1) By Arjuna when
he recounted the exploits of Kṛṣṇa ({%tvayā%}
{%saubhaṃ ca pātitam%}) 3. 13. 29; (2) By
Arjuna again in his message to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
through Saṃjaya ({%ayaṃ saubhaṃ yodhayām%}
{%āsa khasthaṃ … saubhadvāri pratyagṛhṇāc%}
{%chataghnīm%}) 5. 47. 73 (reference to 3. 22.
2-3 where attack on Kṛṣṇa with {%śataghnīs%}
and other missiles is mentioned ?); (3) By
Kṛṣṇa when he suggested to Yudhiṣṭhira
to send Suyodhana and his allies the way
Śālva and Saubha had gone ({%prasthāpya-%}
{%tāṃ pāṇḍava dhārtarāṣṭraḥ suyodhanaḥ … %}
{%saubhasya saubhādhipateś ca mārgam//%})
3. 180. 33; (4) By Vidura when he remind-
ed Duryodhana that a monkey-chief, Dvi-
vida by name, covered Kṛṣṇa with rocks
at the gate of Saubha in order to arrest him
but he did not succeed ({%saubhadvāre vānare-%}

42 (reference to 3. 23. 10-19 where the
showering of rocks is attributed to a Dānava
who had assumed the form of a monkey
{%dānavo vānarākṛtiḥ%}); (5) By Dhṛtarāṣṭra
[Page583-b+ 39]
when he recounted Kṛṣṇa's wonderful
exploits ({%divyāni karmāṇi%} 7. 10. 1); he re-
ferred to his bringing down Saubha which
had taken refuge in the bay of the ocean
({%saubhaṃ … samudrakukṣau vikramya pāta-%}
{%yām āsa mādhavaḥ%}) 7. 10. 14 (reference
to 3. 21. 16-38); (6) By Bhagavān when
he told Nārada that at the conjunction
of Dvāpara and Kali he would destroy all
those residing in the Saubha ({%sarvān sau-%}
{%bhanivāsinaḥ%}) 12. 326. 87. {@E.@} Simile: The
falling down of the Saubha, when struck
by Sudarśana, compared with the falling
down of Tripura tossed up by the arrow
of Maheśvara ({%saubhaṃ suda'śanabalād%}
