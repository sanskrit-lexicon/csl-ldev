{@Prākārakarṇa@}¦ m.: An owl, living on
the mountain Himavant 3. 191. 4.
<div n="P">Sage Mārkaṇḍeya and king ({%rājarṣi%})
Indradyumna approached the owl Prākāra-
karṇa since he was guessed by Mārkaṇḍeya to
be older than both of them; king Indradyumna
asked Prākārakarṇa if he recognized the king;
Prākārakarṇa thought for a while and said
he did not; when asked by Indradyumna if
Prākārakarṇa knew any one older than he, the
owl directed the king to the crane Nāḍījaṅgha
living in the lake Indradyumna; then the king
Indradyumna took both Mārkaṇḍeya and
Prākārakarṇa to Nāḍījaṅgha 3. 191. 5-10.
