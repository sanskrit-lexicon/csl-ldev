{@Vālin@}¦ m.: A monkey-chief, ruler of
<div n="lb">Kiṣkindhā.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Family relations: Son of Śakra
<div n="lb">(Indra) 3. 147. 25; Sugrīva, his brother
<div n="lb">3. 12. 47; 3. 147. 27; 3. 154. 49; 3. 263. 41;
<div n="lb">3. 264. 19 ({%bhrātṛgandhika%} ‘brother only
<div n="lb">in name, not having brotherly affection’);
<div n="lb">his wife Tārā 3. 264 16. 18; Aṅgada, his
<div n="lb">son 3. 266. 27; 3. 272. 14, 17; Suṣeṇa, his
<div n="lb">father-in-law 3. 267. 2. {@B.@} Description:
<div n="lb">Wore a golden garland ({%hemamālin%}) 3. 263.

<div n="lb">{%siṃha%}); he, with Sugrīva, was waited upon
<div n="lb">by all leaders of monkeys 3. 147. 25, 26; he
<div n="lb">maintained a large and flourishing forest
<div n="lb">called {%madhuvana%} 3. 266. 26. {@D.@} Encounter
[Page053-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">with Rāma: Sugrīva, for some reason, was
<div n="lb">offended ({%nikṛtaḥ … kasmiṃśeit kāraṇāntare%}
<div n="lb">3. 147. 27) by Vālin; Rāma advised to take
<div n="lb">Sugrīva's help for the recovery of Sītā
<div n="lb">3. 263. 39; Rāma and Sugrīva entered
<div n="lb">into an agreement: Rāma promised to
<div n="lb">kill Vālin and Sugrīva in return promised
<div n="lb">help in winning back Sītā 3. 264. 14-15;
<div n="lb">when Sugrīva challenged Vālin he was not
<div n="lb">able to stand the roars of Sugrīva; Tārā,
<div n="lb">his wife, tried to dissuade him from going out
<div n="lb">to punish Sugrīva; Vālin asked her to find out
<div n="lb">and tell him whose help Sugrīva had secured;
<div n="lb">she told him about the friendship between
<div n="lb">Rāma and Sugrīva based on having enemies
<div n="lb">for similar reasons (both deprived of their
<div n="lb">wives) ({%tulyārimitratāṃ prāptaḥ sugrīveṇa%}
<div n="lb">{%dhanurdharaḥ (rāmaḥ)%} 3. 264. 21); Vālin
<div n="lb">disregarded Tārā's advice; he suspected her of
<div n="lb">secretly loving Sugrīva, scolded her, and went
<div n="lb">out of his cave ({%guhāmukha%} 3. 264. 26); he
<div n="lb">reminded Sugrīva that he was defeated on
<div n="lb">several occasions before but was spared be-
<div n="lb">cause he was Vālin's kinsman ({%mukto jñātir%}
<div n="lb">{%iti jñātvā%} 3. 264. 27); the two brothers
<div n="lb">fought a duel with {%śāla%} and palm trees, and
<div n="lb">rocks; they also used their fists, nails and
<div n="lb">teeth; it was not possible to distinguish between
<div n="lb">the two, hence Hanūmant stuck a garland on
<div n="lb">Sugrīva's neck; Rāma was then able to single
<div n="lb">out Vāli (3. 264. 35) for his target and
<div n="lb">shoot an arrow on his chest; with his vitals
<div n="lb">pierced and vomitting blood Vālin saw Rāma
<div n="lb">at a distance; he blamed Rāma (for shoot-
<div n="lb">ing him that way) and fell unconscious on the
<div n="lb">ground; after Vālin's death Sugrīva received
<div n="lb">the kingdom of Kiṣkindhā and also Tārā 3.
<div n="lb">264. 14-39; 3. 147. 32; Vālin killed by Rāma
<div n="lb">for the sake of Sugrīva 3. 266. 7; {@E.@} Com-
<div n="lb">parison: Fight between Bhīma and Kirmīra
<div n="lb">compared with that of Vālin and Sugrīva 3.

<div n="lb">so compared 3. 154. 49.
