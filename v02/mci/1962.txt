{@Bhṛgor āśramaḥ<sup>1</sup>@}¦ m.: The {%āśrama%}
established by Bhṛgu.
<div n="P">Past events: (1) King Yuvanāśva,
who lived in forest, entered the {%āśrama%} of
Bhṛgu and drank from a jar filled with
water that was sanctified with the {%mantras%}
and consecrated with austerities ({%saṃbhṛto%}
[Page549-a+ 39]
{%mantrapūtena vāriṇā kalaśo mahān%} 3. 126.
10; {%āpas tapasā caiva saṃbhṛtāḥ%} 3. 126. 18);
(the waters were meant for the queen and
were to cause birth of a son) 3. 126. 8,
12, 14; (2) When Bhṛgu had gone to
bathe, a certain Rakṣas approached his
{%āśrama;%} entering it, he saw there Pulomā,
the wife of Bhṛgu; the Rakṣas was re-
ceived by Pulomā (in the {%āśrama%}) with
fruits and roots 1. 5. 13-15; the Rakṣas
wanted to abduct Pulomā from the {%āśrama%}
after ascertaining from Agni that Pulomā
was really the wife of Bhṛgu 1. 5. 20, 25;
(3) When Vītahavya's sons were killed
by Pratardana, he (Vītahavya) abandoned
his city and fled to the {%āśrama%} of Bhṛgu
({%prādravan nagaraṃ hitvā bhṛgor āśramam%}
{%apy uta%}) 13. 31. 41; Pratardana followed
Vītahavya to Bhṛgu's {%āśrama;%} he told Bhṛgu
that he wanted to see his pupils living in the
{%āśrama;%} knowing this, Bhṛgu came out of
the {%āśrama,%} honoured Pratardana, and was
told that there was no Kṣatriya living in
the {%āśrama;%} all the inmates of the {%āśrama%}
were twice-born; as a result, Vītahavya
became a Brāhmaṇa; Pratardana was happy
that he was instrumental in bringing about
the change in the {%jāti%} of Vītahavya (change
from {%kṣatriya%} to {%dvija%}) 13. 31. 43-51. [See
