{@Paraśuvana@}¦ nt.: Name of a hell.
<div n="P">The name literally means ‘forest of
axes’; it is described as ‘a great hell’
({%paramaniraya, mahāniraya%}) 12. 309. 30-
31; a doer of evil deeds, who is covetous,
to whom untruth is dear, who is always
engaged in deception, he, due to these
cheatings (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 321. 31:
{%upanidhibhiś chalena%}), goes to this hell
and experiences great unhappiness; he
plunges into the great river Vaitaraṇī
[Page938-b+ 40]
whose waters are hot and then gets his
limbs cut by the leaves of trees which are
sharp like a sword; ultimately he falls in-
to the Paraśuvana hell; he lives there
experiencing great affliction ({%yo lubdhaḥ%}
