rounded by thousands of kings ({%rājasa-%}
{%hasrāṇi%} 6. 77. 32) and his normal arrows

enemies 6. 77. 40-41; (iii) when Arjuna
was attacked by Śrutāyus and Acyutāyus

enemies and kill both of them 7. 68. 7-13,

all together, Arjuna manifested Aindra astra

the sun would do with his rays 4. 58. 8-9;
(ii) when Arjuna was attacked by the
Nīvātakavacas with showers of huge rocks,
