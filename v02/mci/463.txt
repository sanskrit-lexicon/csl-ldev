{@Iṣīkā@}¦ f.: A reed or a straw, instead
<div n="lb">of an arrow, used as a missile by Aśvat-
<div n="lb">thāman; the {%astra%} employed on it not named,
<div n="lb">but apparently identical with Brahmaśiras
<div n="lb">(10. 12. 4, 40).
<div n="P">Described as a ‘powerful missile’
<div n="lb">({%paramāstra%}) 10. 13. 17; 10. 15. 12, 23, 33;
<div n="lb">10. 16. 8; ‘heavenly’ ({%divya%}) 10. 15. 16,
<div n="lb">25; ‘unparalleled’ ({%durāsada%}) 10. 15. 16;
<div n="lb">‘fierce’ ({%ghora%}) 10. 15. 11; ‘unfailing’
<div n="lb">({%amogha%}) 10. 15. 31; (10. 16. 8); ‘produc-
<div n="lb">ing big flames and surrounded by a circle
<div n="lb">of lustre’ ({%mahājvālaṃ tejomaṇḍalasaṃ-%}
<div n="lb">{%vṛtam%}) 10. 14. 8; when challenged by
<div n="lb">Bhīma, who was followed by Arjuna and
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira in a chariot, driven by Kṛṣṇa,
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman took a reed ({%iṣīkā%}) in the left
<div n="lb">hand ({%saveyna pāṇinā%}) and thought of the
<div n="lb">heavenly missile, recited {%mantras%} on it to
<div n="lb">imbibe it with the lustre of fire ({%vahnitejo%}
<div n="lb">{%'numantrya vai%} 10. 15. 16), and released it
<div n="lb">for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas ({%apāṇḍa-%}
<div n="lb">{%vāya%} 10. 13. 18; 10. 15. 16); fire broke out
<div n="lb">from the reed which threatened to burn the
<div n="lb">three worlds 10. 13. 15-20; to counter it,
<div n="lb">Arjuna released Brahmaśiras (10. 15. 23)
<div n="lb">saying ‘let the missile be pacified by missile’
<div n="lb">({%astram astreṇa śāmyatām%}) 10. 14. 2-6;
<div n="lb">10. 15. 20; (however, according to 1. 1. 155
<div n="lb">Arjuna said {%‘svasti’%} while releasing his
<div n="lb">missile); apprehending great danger to the
<div n="lb">creatures from the fire released by the two
<div n="lb">missiles, Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
<div n="lb">stood between them and appealed to the
<div n="lb">two heroes to withdraw their missiles since
<div n="lb">they were never used by any one before 10.
<div n="lb">14. 7-16; accordingly, Arjuna withdrew it
<div n="lb">(10. 15. 1, 5, 10), but Aśvatthāman could not
[Page094-a+ 39]
<div n="lb">withdraw it (10. 15. 11) and he admitted to
<div n="lb">the sages his inability to follow their advice
<div n="lb">10. 15. 15; he said the missile must achieve its
<div n="lb">purpose and destroy all the sons of Pāṇḍu 10.
<div n="lb">15. 17; but Vyāsa pointed out that if Aśvat-
<div n="lb">thāman's {%paramāstra%} were to subdue Arjuna's
<div n="lb">Brahmaśiras there would be no rain in the
<div n="lb">land for twelve years; (however, according to
<div n="lb">1. 1. 155 one {%astra%} was pacified by the other
<div n="lb">{%astram astreṇa śāntam%}); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
<div n="lb">therefore asked again Aśvatthāman to with-
<div n="lb">draw his missile and save the nation and the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 25-26; but since the missile
<div n="lb">could not be totally withdrawn, Aśvatthāman
<div n="lb">suggested that the missile should fall, not on
<div n="lb">the Pāṇḍavas, but on their foetus ({%iṣīkā%}
<div n="lb">{%nipatiṣyati/garbheṣu pāṇḍaveyānām%} 10.
<div n="lb">15. 31); when permitted by Vyāsa to do that,
<div n="lb">Aśvatthāman directed the missile to the
<div n="lb">foetus 10. 15. 32-33; it was then destined to
<div n="lb">hit the foetus in the womb of Uttarā 10. 16.
<div n="lb">7-8 [See {@Aiṣikāstra@} and {@Brahmaśiras@}].
