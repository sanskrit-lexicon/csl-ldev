{@Saṃśaptaka@}¦ m. (pl.): A general
term to designate the group of five Trigarta
brothers and their followers who together
took the oath to kill Arjuna; their army in
general, which included besides Trigartas
also Mālavas and many other Janapadas,
is also referred to as Saṃśaptaka; some-
times Nārāyaṇas and Gopālas also figure
in the context of Saṃśaptakas.

events: (1) Saṃśaptakas took away
Arjuna from the main battle-field; after
Abhimanyu's death, Arjuna killed all the
surviving Saṃśaptakas—these two chief
points of the epic events mentioned while
listing the contents of the Droṇaparvan in
the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan 1. 2. 160, 163;
(2) Dānavas informed Duryodhana who
was taken to Rāsātala by a {%kṛtyā%} that the
Saṃśaptakas were Daityas and Rākṣasas in
hundreds and thousands appointed to kill
Arjuna and they would kill him; then Dur-
yodhana felt assured that (Karṇa and) the
Saṃśaptakas were meant to kill Arjuna and
that they were capable of accomplishing
the task; the mind of the Saṃśaptakas was
under the spell of Rākṣasas and, overcome
by the qualities {%rajas%} and {%tamas,%} they were
eager to kill Arjuna ({%sāṃśaptakāś ca te%}

{%ākrāntāḥ phalgunasya vadhaiṣiṇaḥ//%}) 3.
240. 22, 30, 33; (3) Saṃjaya told Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra that in the ensuing war the five
Kekaya brothers would take on the two
chief Trigartas of the Saṃśaptakas ({%trigar-%}
{%tānāṃ ca dvau mukhyau yau tau śaṃśa-%}
{%ptakāv iti%}) 5. 56. 18; (4) An {%ayuta%} of
Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters were meant to
fight with Arjuna resulting either in the
death or victory of Arjuna; they followed
Arjuna wherever he went ({%saṃśaptakānām%}

6. 20. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 20. 15; {%yena%}
[Page897-b+ 40]
{%yatra tena tatra%}); (5) Śuśarman, king of
Trigartas, and his five brothers Satyaratha,
Satyadharman, Satyavarman, Satyeṣuḥ and
Satyakarman together with their army of
Trigartas, as well as Mālavas, Tuṇḍikeras,
Mācellakas, Lalitthas, Madrakas and many
other Janapadas took the oath ({%śapatha%})
to kill Arjuna 7. 16. 11, 15-21; the mode of
oath, also called {%pratijñā,%} in which offerings
were given in fire, described 7. 16. 22-37;
in the description of the war, in the con-
text of Saṃśaptakas, besides some of those
groups of people mentioned above, also
occur Nārāyaṇas, Gopālas (7. 17. 31; 7. 18.
7), and Yaudheyas (7. 18. 16); (6) On
the twelfth day of the war, Droṇa planned a
battle between Arjuna and the Saṃśaptaka
troops and when Arjuna left the main battle-
field to fight with them, he arranged his
army in the Suparṇavyūha against Pāṇḍavas
({%vidhāya yogaṃ pārthena saṃśaptaka-%}
{%gaṇaiḥ saha%}) 7. 19. 2-4; the Saṃśaptakas
arranged their chariots on even ground
in the {%vyūha%} called Candrārdha; they were
delighted to see Arjuna approaching them
for a fight; they roared loudly; Arjuna was
surprised to find that they were delighted
when actually they should have been
grieved; or, he thought, perhaps, they were
delighted because they would go to excellent
worlds (after death) which were otherwise
difficult to be obtained by bad people 7.
17. 1-6; hearing the sound of Devadatta
conch blown by Arjuna, the army of
Saṃśaptakas became motionless; regaining
consciousness they started fighting with
Arjuna by showering {%kaṅkapatrin%} arrows
against him 7. 17. 9-11; the battle des-
cribed in which Subāhu, Sudharman and
Sudhanvan also participated 7. 17. 12-22;
[Page898-a+ 40]
at the death of Sudhanvan, his followers,
afraid, ran towards the army of Duryo-
dhana 7. 17. 23; Suśarman, king of Tri-
gartas, rebuked those who fled; he remind-
ed them of their terrific oaths ({%śaptvā tu%}
{%śapathān ghorān%}); the troops of Saṃśap-
takas then blew their conches and returned
to fight till death ({%mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivarta-%}
{%nam//%}) 7. 17. 27-31; seeing that the troops
of Saṃśaptakas were returning Arjuna asked
Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards them;
he was determined to kill them 7. 18. 1-3;
the Vāyavyāstra released by Arjuna to ward
off the arrows of the opponents also blew
away a large number of Saṃśaptakas along
with their chariots, horses, elephants and
weapons; Arjuna killed a large number of
Saṃśaptakas; their condition as well as the
condition of the battle-field described 7. 18.
22-37; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how
Arjuna dealt with the army of Saṃśaptakas
({%saṃśaptakabalaṃ prati%}) and how did
they encounter him 7. 25. 2; Arjuna left
Saṃśaptakas for a while to fight with
Bhagadatta who was routing the Pāṇḍava
army; fourteen thousand Saṃśaptakas
followed him and challenged him; Arjuna
hesitated for a while whether to fight with
Saṃśaptakas or go to help Yudhiṣṭhira;
ultimately he decided to kill Saṃśaptakas
(first) ({%abhavad bhuyasī buddhiḥ saṃśa-%}
{%ptakavadhe sthirā%}); the great Saṃśaptaka
chariot-fighters ({%saṃśaptakamahārathāḥ%})
discharged numerous smooth arrows ({%śata-%}
{%sahasrāṇi śarāṇāṃ nataparvaṇāṃ%}) on
Arjuna with the result that, covered with
the arrows, neither Arjuna, nor Kṛṣṇa, nor
his horses, nor chariot, could be seen; when
Kṛṣṇa was deluded ({%moham anuprāptaḥ … %}
{%janārdanaḥ%}) Arjuna killed Saṃśaptakas
[Page898-b+ 40]
with Vajrāstra 7. 26. 10, 12-14, 18-20; the
condition of Saṃśaptakas described 7. 26.
21-27; having killed Saṃśaptakas Arjuna
asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards
Bhagadatta 7. 26. 29; but Suśarman and
his Saṃśaptaka brothers followed Arjuna
challenging him for a fight ({%yuddhārthī%}
{%pṛṣthato 'nvayāt// … suśarmāhvayate%}
{%'cyuta//%}); Arjuna therefore was again in
doubt-whether to kill Saṃśaptakas first
or to go to the aid of his side 7. 27. 2-5;
he asked Kṛṣṇa to turn back and started
fighting with Suśarman; his battle with
Saṃśaptaka brothers described in which
Suśarman swooned 7. 27. 7-10; later,
Arjuna continued to kill the surviving Saṃ-
śaptakas and Nārāyaṇas on the southern
side of the army ({%dakṣiṇena tu senāyāḥ%}
{%kurute kadanaṃ bali/saṃśaptakāvaśeṣasya%}
{%nārāyaṇabalasya ca//%}) 7. 30. 29; after
killing the Saṃśaptakas, Arjuna returned to
attack Droṇa and the Kaurava army 7. 31.
41-44; (7) On the thirteenth day, when
Droṇa reiterated the necessity of removing
Arjuna from the main battle, Saṃśapta-
kas renewed their challenge to Arjuna and
took him away to the south of the battle-
field ({%āhvayann arjunaṃ saṃkhye dakṣiṇām%}
{%abhito diśam%}) 7. 32. 15; towards the end
of the day, Arjuna proceeded towards his
camp after killing Saṃśaptakas 7. 50. 1-3;
Yudhiṣṭhira, grieved over the death of
Abhimanyu, told Arjuna that after he left
to fight with the Saṃśaptaka army, Droṇa
made a serious attempt to capture him 7.
51. 1; (8) On the fourteenth day, at
the instance of Duryodhana, the army
of Kauravas, along with Saṃśaptakas,
returned to fight with Sātyaki with great
determination ({%te punaḥ saṃnyavartanta%}
[Page899-a+ 40]
{%kṛtvā saṃśaptakān mithaḥ%}) 7. 97. 12; when
Duḥśāsana was wounded by Sātyaki,
Duryodhana asked Trigartas to fight with
Sātyaki; Saṃśaptakas again made a deter-
mined effort to attack Sātyaki; Sātyaki
killed their five hundred chief warriors,
showering arrows on them, at the head of
the army ({%agrānīke vyapothayat%}) 7. 99.
3-7; their condition described 7. 99. 8-11;
ultimately they retreated in the direction of
Droṇa 7. 99. 12; (9) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra
was told that on the sixteenth day, angry
Arjuna attacked the Saṃśaptaka troops
({%saṃśaptakagaṇān%} 8. 9. 8) he wished to
know the details of the fight between Saṃ-
śaptakas and Arjuna; Arjuna entered the
large ocean-like troops of Saṃśaptakas
({%saṃśaptakagaṇaṃ … arṇavasaṃnibham%})
and agitated it ({%vyakṣobhayat%}); the fight
in which Arjuna cut off the hands and heads
of his opponents with sharp arrows and
killed elephants and horses along with their
riders as well as chariot-fighters was hair-
raising ({%lomaharṣaṇam%}) 8. 12. 1, 3-13; at
that point Aśvatthāman challenged Arjuna;
hence he asked Kṛṣṇa whether he should
continue killing Saṃśaptakas or accept the
challenge of Aśvatthāman: Kṛṣṇa drove
him to Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 21-22; after
fighting with Aśvatthāman, Arjuna return-
ed to Saṃśaptaka horse-riders, chariot-
fighters, elephant-riders and foot-soldiers
({%tataḥ saṃśaptakān bhūyaḥ sāśvasūtaratha-%}
{%dvipān/dhvajapattigaṇān%}) 8. 12. 36; battle
described in which Arjuna killed all kinds
of his opponents ({%saṃśaptakamahārṇavam/%}
{%vyaśoṣayata duḥśoṣam … %}) and returned
to fight with Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 37-43, 47;
after fighting for a while with him, Arjuna
came back to Saṃśaptakas; he cut off the
[Page899-b+ 40]
hands, heads, weapons etc. of the opponents
who did not turn back ({%aparāṅmukhānām%})
8. 12. 54-58; after Arjuna's one more
encounter with Aśvatthāman in which the
latter was removed from the battle by his
horses, Arjuna continued his battle with
Saṃśaptakas 8. 12. 70-71; when there was
loud noise to the north of the battle-field
(8. 13. 1), Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to go
there and first fight with Māgadha Daṇḍa-
dhāra; he could later kill the Saṃśaptakas
8. 13. 4; accordingly, Arjuna first killed
Daṇḍadhāra and his elephant and came
back to Saṃśaptakas 8. 13. 25; in the
battle that followed, Arjuna killed many
Saṃśaptakas, while Kṛṣṇa drove his chariot
in various roundabout ways ({%vakrānuva-%}
{%kragamanāt%}) 8. 14. 1; the battle described
8. 14. 2-21; at that moment Kṛṣṇa advised
Arjuna not to while away his time with
Saṃśaptakas; he should kill them without
loss of time and hasten to kill Karṇa
({%kiṃ krīḍase 'nagha/saṃśaptakān prama-%}
{%thyaitāṃs tataḥ karṇavadhe tvara%}); Arjuna
agreed and killed quickly the remaining
Saṃśaptakas ({%kṣipraṃ śiṣṭān saṃśapta-%}
{%kāṃs tadā/ākṣipya śastreṇa balād … %}
{%avadhīt%}) 8. 14. 22-23; Trigartas, along with
Śālvas, Saṃśaptakas, and Nārāyaṇas, led
by the king of Trigartas and his brothers,
attacked Arjuna 8. 19. 2-4; the battle, in
which Saṃśaptakas were killed by hundreds
and thousands ({%śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ%} 8.
19. 19) and at one stage they surrounded
Arjuna and showered him with weapons,
described 8. 19. 5-34; in the end almost
the entire Saṃśaptaka army turned back
and did not stay to face Arjuna ({%prāyaśo%}
{%vimukhaṃ sarvaṃ nāvatiṣṭhata saṃyuge%});
Arjuna thus won victory over many Saṃ-
[Page900-a+ 40]
śaptaka troops ({%saṃśaptakagaṇān bahūn%})
8. 19. 34-35; (10) On the seventeenth
day, thirty-four thousand chariot-fighters of
Śaṃśaptakas determined to fight to the end
stood on the left side of the Bārhaspatya-
vyūha of Kauravas ({%catustriṃśatsahasrāṇi%}
{%rathānām anivartinām/saṃśaptakā … %}
{%vāmaṃ pārśvam apālayan … bārhaspatyaḥ%}
{% … mahāvyūhaḥ%}) 8. 31. 14, 26; Śalya
drew attention of Karṇa to Saṃśaptakas
who had challenged Arjuna; in response,
they were being attacked and killed by
Arjuna; angered Saṃśaptakas covered him
on all sides making Arjuna invisible
({%saṃśaptakaiḥ kruddhaiḥ … channaḥ pārtho%}
{%na dṛśyate%}) 8. 31. 56-57; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya to describe to him the
battle between Arjuna and Saṃśaptakas;
Saṃjaya told him that when the armies
were arrayed ({%atha vyūḍheṣv anīkeṣu%}),
Arjuna attacked Saṃśaptakas; wishing
to kill Arjuna and determined to win
victory not minding death ({%vijaye kṛta-%}
{%saṃkalpā mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivartanam%}) they
rushed towards Arjuna; their army consi-
sted of many horses, elephants, chariot-
fighters and foot-soldiers; a fierce battle
then took place; Arjuna cut off their hands,
holding different weapons, as well as their
heads; thinking Arjuna's chariot was
drowned in the large army, Saṃśaptakas
delightfully raised a roar ({%tasmin sainye%}
{%mahāvarte … /nimagnaṃ taṃ rathaṃ matvā%}
{%neduḥ saṃśaptakā mudā/%}) 8. 32. 1-13; at
the site where Arjuna was killing Saṃśapta-
kas a loud sound of Gāṇḍīva was heard;
very much angered Saṃśaptakas, coveting
victory ({%jayagṛddhāḥ pramanyavaḥ%}) sho-
wered arrows on Arjuna; Arjuna braved
their attack and reached Suśarman; when
[Page900-b+ 40]
Arjuna started showering arrows on Suśar-
man, Saṃśaptakas responded the same way;
hearing the roar of the monkey on Arjuna's
chariot, the army of Saṃśaptakas was much
terrified and became motionless; regain-
ing consciousness, the warriors showered
arrows on Arjuna and covered his chariot;
they held firmly the horses, the wheels and
the shaft of Arjuna's chariot and roared
loudly ({%te hayān rathacakre ca ratheṣāś%}
{%cāpi bhārata/nigṛhya balavat%}); some
mounted on Arjuna's chariot and held him
and Kṛṣṇa; shaking his hands Kṛṣṇa felled
them down; Arjuna saw Saṃśaptaka great
chariot-fighters encircling him and holding
his chariot and Kṛṣṇa; he felled many of
them down who had mounted the chariot
and other foot-soldiers who were close to
him by shooting arrows which went short
distances ({%apātayat/āsannāṃś ca tato%}
{%yodhāñ śarair āsannayodhibhiḥ%}); he made
the rest run away; Arjuna pointed out to
Kṛṣṇa that he had killed thousands of
Saṃśaptakas who had achieved the difficult
task of checking his chariot ({%kurvāṇān%}
{%dāruṇaṃ karma … rathabandhaṃ imaṃ/%}
{%ghoraṃ%}); Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa blew Deva-
datta and Pāñcajanya conches respy.;
hearing that sound, the Saṃśaptaka army
shook and became very much afraid ({%saṃ-%}
{%cacāla … vitrastā cābhavad bhṛśam%});
Arjuna then bound their feet by releasing
{%nāgāstra;%} he killed them in that condition;
when they were being killed, they gave up
fighting with Arjuna and threw down their
weapons; then Suśarman released them
from their bonds by using {%sauparṇāstra;%}
once free, they showered arrows and
weapons on Arjuna ({%sasṛjur bāṇasaṃ-%}
{%ghāṃś ca śastrasaṃghāṃś ca%}); Arjuna cut
[Page901-a+ 40]
off the missiles with arrows and killed many
elephants, horses and chariot-fighters by
using {%aindrāstra;%} the troops of Saṃśaptakas
and Nārāyaṇas were then very much afraid;
no one was able to fight back Arjuna ({%na%}
{%hi kaścit pumāṃs tatra yo 'rjunaṃ pratya-%}
{%vidhyata%}); Arjuna then killed an {%ayuta%} of
the opposing warriors; fourteen thousand
(foot) warriors, an {%ayuta%} of chariot-
fighters, and three thousand elephant-
riders of Saṃśaptakas who survived ({%yāni%}
{%śiṣṭāni%}) once again surrounded Arjuna
determined either to return with victory
or die ({%martavayam iti niścitya jayaṃ vāpi%}
{%nivartanam%}); a fierce fighting then was
fought between them and Arjuna (8. 37.
1-38); Arjuna destroyed many Saṃśapta-
kas; their Kṣatriyas, tormented by him,
were killed ({%te kṣatriyā dahyamānās … %}
{%jagmur vināśam%}) 8. 40. 5-61 after killing
many Saṃśaptaka troops ({%nihatya … saṃ-%}
{%śaptakagaṇān bahūn%}), Arjuna pointed out
to Kṛṣṇa the great Saṃśaptaka chariot-
fighters who along with their troops ran
away as they were unable to resist his
arrows ({%dhāvanti sagaṇāḥ saṃśaptakamahā-%}
{%rathāḥ/apārayanto madbāṇān%}) 8. 40. 78-
80; Duryodhana again incited Saṃśaptakas
to face Arjuna; then a thousand chariot-
fighters, three hundred elephant-riders,
fourteen thousand horse-riders and two
hundred thousand archers turned towards
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna covering them with
arrows; but Arjuna killed ten thousand
Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 92-99; thus Arjuna
completely destroyed ({%kṛtsnena vyadha-%}
{%mat%}) the Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 130; when
the armies of Kurus and Sṛñjayas met
again only a few Saṃśaptakas had sur-
vived ({%saṃśaptakeṣu … kiṃcicchiṣṭeṣu%});
[Page901-b+ 40]
Arjuna, after defeating Aśvatthāman (8.
42. 51), asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Saṃ-
śaptakas since fighting with them was his
main task ({%kāryam etat paraṃ mama%}) 8.
42. 3, 56; Arjuna killed the remaining Saṃ-
śaptaka troops with sharp arrows with the
result that they became the guests of Indra
and became free from grief as they were
happy ({%śakrasyātithitām gatvā viśokā hy%}
{%abhavan mudā%}) 8. 43. 76-77; when Arjuna
told Bhīma that he could not leave the
battlefield (to go to enquire about Yudhi-
ṣṭhira) without killing Saṃśaptakas who
faced him, Bhīma assured him that he
himself would fight with the Saṃśaptakas
8. 45. 63-64; Arjuna while explaining to
Yudhiṣṭhira why he had not yet killed
Karṇa told him that during his fight with
Saṃśaptakas, Aśvatthāman had unexpec-
tedly intervened (to distract him) 8. 47.
2; later, while boasting about his heroic
deeds Arjuna mentioned that he had killed
almost all Saṃśaptakas and only a few of
them had survived ({%saṃśaptakānāṃ kiṃcid%}
{%evāvaśiṣṭam%}) 8. 49. 96; at one stage, Duḥśā-
sana along with the fully equipped army of
Saṃśaptakas ({%pṛtanā samṛddhā%}) attacked
Bhīma 8. 53. 9; when Arjuna was proceeding
towards Karṇa, Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters
attacked him showering arrows; Arjuna
killed many of them along with their chari-
oteers, and cut off their bows and banners
with sharp arrows; they all fell down from
their chariots 8. 59. 3-5; (11) On the
seventeenth day, at night, when Saṃjaya
reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Karṇa
(8. 1. 25), he (Dhṛtarāṣṭra), while recalling
some of the major events of war, mention-
ed the killing of the Saṃśaptaka army by
Arjuna 8. 1. 41; in reply to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's
[Page902-a+ 40]
question who of the Kurus were still alive
and who dead ({%ke nu jīvanti ke mṛtāḥ%})
8. 4. 3, Saṃjaya mentioned Saṃśaptaka
troops ({%saṃśaptakagaṇāś ca ye%}) among
those who were killed by Arjuna 8. 4.
38; (12) On the eighteenth day, Arjuna
speedily rushed towards Kṛtavarman and
Saṃśaptaka troops which were posted on
the left side of the Sarvatobhadravyūha of
Kauravas 9. 7. 30, 19, 24 (where Saṃ-
śaptakas are designated as Trigartas);
Arjuna, having killed Saṃśaptakas in battle
({%hatvā saṃśaptakān raṇe%}) rushed towards,
the army of Kauravas 9. 9. 59; as the
day advanced ({%madhyaṃdinagate sūrye%}),
Aśvatthāman, helped by Saṃśaptakas
({%saṃśaptakavṛto raṇe%}), fought with Arjuna;
the battle was terrific in which a large
number of warriors were killed ({%tatra%}
{%yuddhaṃ mahac cāsīt … yamarāṣṭravivar-%}
{%dhanam%}) 9. 13. 42-43; ({%vimardas tu mahān%}
{%āsīt%}) 9. 13. 45; (13) On the nineteenth
day, after the war was over, Saṃjaya,
having returned early in the morning from
the camp ({%tataḥ pūrvāhṇasamaye śibirād%}
{%etya saṃjayaḥ%} 9. 1. 14), while reporting
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the war-events mentioned
Saṃśaptakas among those who were killed
in war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛtarāṣṭra lamenting the
loss of life in war mentioned that many
Saṃśaptakas were killed ({%saṃśaptakāś ca%}
{%bahavaḥ (nihatāḥ)%}) 9. 2. 34; (14) Kṛṣṇa,
while giving an account of war to Vasu-
deva, mentioned that before the fall of
Abhimanyu, Saṃśaptakas had challenged
Arjuna for a battle and took him away
from the main scene ({%samāhūte tu saṃ-%}
