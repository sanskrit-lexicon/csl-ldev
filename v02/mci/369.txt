{@Saramā@}¦ f.: A mythical bitch of the
gods ({%devaśunī%} 1. 3. 9, {%mātā śunāṃ devī%}
3. 219. 33).
[Page065-a+ 39]
<div n="P">The dog, her son {%sārameya%} (1. 3. 2),
beaten by the brothers of Janamejaya when
the dog went to the king's long sacrificial
session; crying aloud the dog went to
his mother; when asked the reason of his
crying, the {%sārameya%} told her that he was
beaten up by Janamejaya's brothers; when
asked again what fault the {%sārameya%} had
committed he told her that he had done
nothing wrong like looking at the offerings
or licking them; afflicted at the grief of her
son, Saramā went to the place where the
session was in progress and cursed
Janamejaya; since her son was beaten up
for no fault, an unforeseen danger would
overtake the king 1. 3. 2-9; she visits the
{%sabhā%} of Pitāmaha Brahman and waits on
him 2. 11. 29, 31; she is one of those
{%mahāgrahas%} who take hold of the foetus in
the womb of the mother; these {%mahāgrahas%}
are unfavourable to young children and afflict
them until they are sixteen years old; there-
after they become favourable 3. 219. 33-41.
