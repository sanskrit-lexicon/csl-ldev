<div n="P">The dog, her son {%sārameya%} (1. 3. 2),
<div n="lb">beaten by the brothers of Janamejaya when
<div n="lb">the dog went to the king's long sacrificial
<div n="lb">session; crying aloud the dog went to
<div n="lb">his mother; when asked the reason of his
<div n="lb">crying, the {%sārameya%} told her that he was
<div n="lb">beaten up by Janamejaya's brothers; when
<div n="lb">asked again what fault the {%sārameya%} had
<div n="lb">committed he told her that he had done
<div n="lb">nothing wrong like looking at the offerings
<div n="lb">or licking them; afflicted at the grief of her
<div n="lb">son, Saramā went to the place where the
<div n="lb">session was in progress and cursed
<div n="lb">Janamejaya; since her son was beaten up
<div n="lb">for no fault, an unforeseen danger would

<div n="lb">the womb of the mother; these {%mahāgrahas%}
<div n="lb">are unfavourable to young children and afflict
<div n="lb">them until they are sixteen years old; there-
<div n="lb">after they become favourable 3. 219. 33-41.
