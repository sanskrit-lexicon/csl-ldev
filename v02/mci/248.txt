{@Bhūliṅgaśakuni@}¦ f.: Name of a female
bird.
<div n="P">Lives on the other side of Himavant; re-
puted to utter cries which sound like {%mā-%}
{%sāhasam%} ‘do not commit a rash act’, but
herself acts rashly; she, a dull-witted bird,
tries to pick out pieces of flesh stuck between
the teeth of a lion when he is eating flesh;
obviously she lives at the pleasure of the lion;
hence cited as an example for those who,
[Page044-b+ 39]
while living at the pleasure of others, act
rashly but tell others not to do so; according
to Śiśupāla Bhīṣma acted like this Bhūliṅga-
śakuni when he praised Kṛṣṇa 2. 41. 18-23.
