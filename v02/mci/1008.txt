{@Asvaśiras@}¦ nt.: Name of a {%tīrtha.%}
{@A.@} Description: Holy ({%puṇya%}) 7. 57.
28. {@B.@} Epic events connected with this
{%tīrtha:%} (1) The sage Bṛhadaśva taught
{%akṣahṛdaya%} (the secret science of the game
of dice), which he knew thoroughly well
(3. 78. 15), to Yudhiṣṭhira (to dispel the
latter's fear of losing everything once again
in the game of dice), and then went to
Aśvaśiras to bathe ({%dattvā cāśvaśiro 'gac-%}
{%chad upaspraṣṭuṃ mahātapāḥ%}) 3. 78. 17
(Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 3. 79. 21:
{%aśvaśiro 'svavidyām yayā bṛhadaśva iti%}
{%muner nāma/upaspraṣṭuṃ snānādikaṃ%}
{%kartum%}) (this Aśvaśiras apparently was in
the vicinity of the Kāmyaka forest where
Bṛhadaśva met the Pāṇḍavas 3. 49. 2, 29);
(2) Arjuna, on his way to the mountain
Himavant to receive the Pāśupata {%astra%}
from Śiva crossed many places near the
Himavant, one of them being Aśvaśiras 7.
57. 28 (this Aśvaśiras seems to be different
from the one referred to in the above event).
