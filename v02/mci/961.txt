{@Sūrya@}¦ m.: Name of the planet Sun,
referred to also as {@Āditya@} and by its other
synonyms like {@Arka, Ravi, Bhāskara,@}
{@Bhānu, Pataṃga.@}
{@A.@} Origin and activity: According to
Bhīṣma, Āditya, along with Candra, other
planets, constellations and stars were born
from Viṣvaksena (i. e. Kṛṣṇa) ({%candrādi-%}
{%tyau grahanakṣatratārāḥ … viṣvaksenāt%}
{%sarvam etat prasūtam%}) 13. 143. 31; Puru-
sottama (Nārāyaṇa) told the seven sages,
[Page275-b+ 40]
Marīci and others, that Sūrya, Candramas,
all constellations act in their own prescribed
way in their respective spheres and are
considered an authority ({%suryācandramasau%}
{% … sarve ca nakṣatragaṇāḥ … adhikāreṣu%}
{%vartante yathāsvam … sarve pramāṇaṃ hi%}
12. 322. 39-40. {@B.@} Description: Radiant
({%gabhastimant%}) 2. 11. 17; ({%aṃśumant%})
6. 32. 21; rich in light ({%vibhārasu%}) 6. 13.
44; very generous ({%paramodāra%}) 6. 13. 44.
{@C.@} Extent: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to
tell him everything about the extent ({%sarvaṃ%}
{%pramāṇam%}) of Arka, to which Saṃjaya agreed
6. 12. 3-4; according to Saṃjaya's information
the diameter ({%viṣkambha%}) of Sūrya was 1000
{%yojanas%} and the circumference ({%maṇḍala%})
was 30000 {%yojanas;%} (according to the
learned Pauraṇīkas) Sūrya's expanse (?
{%vipulatva%}) was 5800 {%yojanas (sūryas tv%}

{%atvena cānagha/śrūyate paramodāraḥ%}
{%pataṃgo 'sau vibhāvasuḥ/etat pramāṇam%}
{%arkasya nirḍiṣṭam iha bhārata)%} 6. 13. 43-
44 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets
{%vipulatvena%} as {%tato 'py ādhikeyena;%} in that
case the circumference of Sūrya will be
30000 + 5800 = 35800 {%yojanas;%} see also the
Editor's note on the stanza 6. 13. 41, Vol.
7, p. 765); on account of the larger extent
of Rāhu, it covers Candra and Āditya at
proper times ({%sa rāhuś chādayaty etau%}
{%yathākālaṃ mahattayā/candrādityau%})
6. 13. 45. {@D.@} Importance: (1) Upamanyu
while praising Śiva said that he (Śiva) was
Sūrya among the planets ({%grahāṇāṃ sūrya%}
{%ucyase%}) 13. 14. 156; Sūrya appears in a
complex name of Śiva ({%candrasūryagatiḥ%})
13. 17. 37; (2) Śiva made Bhāskara the
[Page276-a+ 40]
chief of the luminous bodies ({%tejasāṃ%}
{%bhāskaraṃ cakre (īśam)%}) 12. 122. 31;
Brahmā told the sages that Sūrya was the
chief of the planets ({%sūryo grahāṇām adhi-%}
{%paḥ%}) 14. 43. 6; Arka was known as the
chief of the hot luminaries ({%arko 'dhipatir%}

{%ṣām patiḥ%} 6. 7. 14; {%khecarāṇāṃ pravaro%}
{%yathārkaḥ%} 1. 83. 7; (3) Bhagavān, while
narrating his {%vibhūtis,%} said that he was
Ravi among the luminous bodies ({%jyotiṣāṃ%}
{%ravir aṃśumān%}) 6. 32. 21; (4) The
divine sages, the Siddhas, and the great
sages saw Candra, Āditya and Budha, among
others, in the abode of Brahman 1. 203. 4;
Āditya, along with Candra and constellations,
wait on Brahmadeva in his {%sabhā%} 2. 11. 17;
{@E.@} Advent of the Kṛtayuga: Mārkaṇḍeya
told the Pāṇḍavas that when Candra, Sūrya,
the constellation Tiṣya (Puṣya) and Bṛhas-
pati will come together in one {%rāśi,%} the
Kṛtayuga will set in 3. 188. 87 (for citation
and Nī.'s commentary on it, see above
{@Puṣya<sup>1</sup>,@} p. 257. 1). {@F.@} Mythological
events: (1) Candra, Āditya, the planets,

of the heaven felt dejected due to the
destruction caused by Sunda and Upasunda
({%candrādityau grahās tārā nakṣatrāṇi%}
{%divaukasaḥ/jagmur viṣādam%}) 1. 202. 26;
(2) when the gods made ready a chariot for
Śiva's fight with the Tripuras, Sūrya and
Candramas were made the two wheels of the
excellent chariot ({%sūryācandramasau kṛtvā%}
{%cakre rathavarottame%}) 8. 24. 71. {@G.@}
Auspicious: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira
that in war the side which had wind, Sūrya
and Śukra favourable to it became victorious;
if they were simultaneously present, the former
of the two proved stronger ({%yato vāyur%}
[Page276-b+ 40]
{%yataḥ sūryō yataḥ śukras tato jayaḥ/%}
{%pūrvaṃ pūrvaṃ jyāya eṣāṃ saṃnipāte%}
{%yudhiṣṭhira//%}) 12. 101. 17; (2) Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra told Saṃjaya that when he heard that
both Śukra and Sūrya were favourable to
Pāṇḍavas indicating their victory, he lost
all hopes of winning the war ({%yadā śrau-%}

{%anukūlau jayāya/ … tadā nāśaṃse vija-%}
{%yāya saṃjaya//%}) 1. 1. 129. {@H.@} Omens:
(1) According to an astronomical event
which took place before the war and which
was noticed by Vyāsa, {%amāvāsyā%} occurred
on the thirteenth day of the month which
was very unusual; on that occasion Candra
and Sūrya were untimely swallowed the same
month by Rāhu which indicated destruction
of the subjects ({%caturdaśīṃ pañcadaśīm%}
{%bhūtapūrvāṃ ca ṣoḍaśīm/imāṃ tu nābhi-%}

{%sūryāv ubhau grastāv ekamāse trayodaśīm/%}
{%aparvaṇi grahāv etau prajāḥ saṃkṣapayi-%}
{%ṣyataḥ//%}) 6. 3. 28-29 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.

{%rāhuṇā grahaṇaṃ prāptau etad eva prajā-%}
{%saṃkṣayahetutvena śāstre dṛṣṭam/%}); a
similar event—Rāhu swallowing both Āditya
and Soma simultaneously—also occurred
when the Sindhu heroes fought Arjuna and
at that time the meteors struck Sūrya and
were scattered ({%ulkāś ca jaghnire sūryaṃ%}
{%vikīryantyaḥ samantataḥ%}) 14. 76. 15-16;
for Rāhu's swallowing Āditya out of time
({%aparvaṇi%}) also cf. 2. 71. 26, and 9. 55.
10; also cf. 5. 141. 10; and 6. 3. 11 (in the
last two references {%aparvaṇi%} does not occur);

(for Nī.'s comment on Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 11
see {@Rāhu@} above p. 267. 1 and on Bom. Ed.
6. 3. 11 he says: {%tatra tulāstham arkaṃ%}
{%rāhur upaiti%}); (2) According to another
omen noticed by Vyāsa, Arka, Indu and the
constellations were blazing day and night
irrespective of the fact whether it was day
time or night time; that also indicated des-
struction ({%jvalitārkendunakṣatram nirviśe-%}
{%ṣadinakṣapam/ahorātraṃ mayā dṛṣtaṃ%}
{%tat kṣayāya bhaviṣyati%}) 6. 2. 22; (3)
According to an omen noticed by Karṇa, a
line of black clouds covered Bhānu at dawn
and dusk which foretold great danger ({%kṛṣṇaś%}
{%ca parighas tatra bhānum āvṛtya tiṣṭhati/%}
{%udayāstamye saṃdhye vedayāno mahad%}
{%bhayam//%}) 5. 141. 22 (but Nī. on Bom.
Ed 5. 143. 23: {%parighaḥ pariveśaḥ%}); (4)
According to the omens noticed by Saṃjaya,
when the two armies faced each other at
Kurukṣetra, Āditya at its rise appeared as
though split into two ({%dvidhābhūta ivāditya%}
{%udaye pratyadṛśyata%}) 6. 17. 3; (5) When
Karṇa marched out for war many unusual
happenings ({%utpātas%}) occurred, one of them
being that seven major planets were seen
issuing out of Sūrya ({%niścaranto vyadṛśyanta%}
{%sūryāt sapta mahāgrahāḥ%}) 8. 26. 34 (Nī.,
however, on Bom. Ed. 8. 37. 4: {%niścaranto%}
{%yuddhārtham iti śeṣaḥ/suāryāt sūryam%}
{%ārabhya sūryādayo 'nyonyam yudhyantīty%}
{%arthaḥ%}); (6) Yājñavalkya told Janaka that
if one saw the moon (Soma) or the sun (Saha-
srāṃśu) with a hole (in the middle) like a
wheel with a broken nave he had only a week
to live ({%śīrṇanābhi yathā cākraṃ chidraṃ%}
{%somaṃ prapaśyati/tathaiva ca sahasrāṃ-%}
{%śuṃ saptarātreṇa mṛtyubhāk%}) 12. 305. 13.
{@I.@} Similes: (1) Draupadī's five sons rushed
at the demon Ārśyaśṛṅgi (Alambusa) as five
[Page277-b+ 39]
planets rush at Ravi ({%grahāḥ pañca yathā%}
{%ravim%}) 6. 96. 35; (2) Bhīmasena, encircled
by the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, looked like Sūrya
encircled by fierce planets at the time of the
destruction of the people ({%prajāsaṃharaṇe%}
{%sūryaḥ krūrair iva mahāgrahaiḥ%}) 6. 73. 10;
(3) Lakṣmaṇa and Rāma, surrounded by
the monkey-chiefs, looked like Candra and
Sūrya surrounded by the planets ({%candra-%}

ferences to the sun's eclipse can be found]
