{@Tripura@}¦ nt.: Name of the three cities
<div n="lb">of the three Asuras.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Creation: Created by Asura Maya
<div n="lb">for the three sons of Tāraka, viz. Tārākṣa (or
<div n="lb">Tārakākṣa), Kamalākṣa and Vidyunmālin;
<div n="lb">the cities were obtained by them as a boon
<div n="lb">from Pitāmaha; one of the three cities was
<div n="lb">made of gold, the other of silver, and the
<div n="lb">third of iron; they moved in them respectively
<div n="lb">in heaven, in mid region, and with the third,
<div n="lb">stationed on wheels, on the earth; ({%kāñcanaṃ%}

<div n="lb">teristics: (1) The three cities were
<div n="lb">supposed to come together and be united
<div n="lb">at the end of one thousand years; if some
<div n="lb">prominent god were then to strike the cities
<div n="lb">with a single arrow, the god would be death
<div n="lb">for them ({%samāgatāni caitāni yo hanyād%}

<div n="lb">Whatever was desired by a person who had
<div n="lb">taken shelter in the Tripuras ({%tripurasaṃ-%}

<div n="lb">(3) Hari, the son of Tārakākṣa, obtained
<div n="lb">as a boon from Pitāmaha, a well in their
<div n="lb">{%pura (vāpī bhavatu naḥ pure);%} if any
<div n="lb">demon, wounded by weapons, was thrown
<div n="lb">into this well, he arose from it stronger;
<div n="lb">if a dead demon was thrown into it, he

<div n="lb">fied with this well the denizens of the
<div n="lb">Tripuras oppressed all the three worlds
<div n="lb">8. 24. 23-27. {@D.@} Mythological event:
<div n="lb">Since Indra was unable to shatter the Tri-
<div n="lb">puras, although he used all his weapons
<div n="lb">against them, gods approached Rudra and
<div n="lb">requested him to destroy the demons and
<div n="lb">their cities; Śiva then burnt the three {%puras%}
<div n="lb">together with the demons, using gods as
<div n="lb">chariot ({%devān rathavaram kṛtvā%}), god
<div n="lb">Viṣṇu as arrow, Agni as tip of the arrow
<div n="lb">({%śalya%}), Yama as hind part of the arrow
<div n="lb">({%puṅkha%}); Śiva's arrow had three joints
<div n="lb">and three heads (to correspond to the
<div n="lb">three {%puras ?%}) ({%triparvaṇā triśalyena … %}
<div n="lb">{%śareṇa%}) 13. 145. 24-29; Śiva's chariot
<div n="lb">was driven in the direction of the Tripuras
[Page531-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">by Pitāmaha; Śiva employed his Pāśupata
<div n="lb">missile on his bow and thought of the
<div n="lb">Tripuras ({%tripuraṃ samacintayat%}) 8. 24.
<div n="lb">115; at the appointed time the three {%puras%}
<div n="lb">came together and were united; when they
<div n="lb">came in his view, Śiva shot his arrow which
<div n="lb">burnt the Tripuras and the demons in them
<div n="lb">and threw them in the western ocean; thus
<div n="lb">Maheśvara, wishing well for the three
<div n="lb">worlds, burnt the Tripuras and the demons
<div n="lb">8. 24. 114-121; this report in the Karṇa-
<div n="lb">parvan of the downfall of the Tripuras

<div n="lb">(1) The town Saubha, when cut into two
<div n="lb">by the Sudarśanacakra of Kṛṣṇa, fell down
<div n="lb">as did the Tripura when tossed up by the
