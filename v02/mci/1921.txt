{@Tripura@}¦ nt.: Name of the three cities
of the three Asuras.
{@A.@} Creation: Created by Asura Maya
for the three sons of Tāraka, viz. Tārākṣa (or
Tārakākṣa), Kamalākṣa and Vidyunmālin;
the cities were obtained by them as a boon
from Pitāmaha; one of the three cities was
made of gold, the other of silver, and the
third of iron; they moved in them respectively
in heaven, in mid region, and with the third,
stationed on wheels, on the earth; ({%kāñcanaṃ%}

{%pate//%}) 8. 24. 4, 10, 13-15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
8. 33. 18, however, {%cakrasthaṃ ājñāvaśaṃ%}
{%yatheṣṭasaṃcārīty arthaḥ%}); (according to
13. 145. 24, however, all the three cities were
in heaven ({%asurāṇāṃ purāṇy āsaṃs trīṇi%}

[Page530-b+ 40]
cription: Inaccessible ({%durga%}) 8. 24. 20;
guarded by Daityas and Dānavas ({%daitya-%}
{%dānavarakṣita%}) 8. 24. 114. {@C.@} Charac-
teristics: (1) The three cities were
supposed to come together and be united
at the end of one thousand years; if some
prominent god were then to strike the cities
with a single arrow, the god would be death
for them ({%samāgatāni caitāni yo hanyād%}
{%bhagavaṃs tadā/ekeṣuṇā devavaraḥ sa%}
{%no mṛtyur bhaviṣyati//%}) 8. 24. 11-12; (2)
Whatever was desired by a person who had
taken shelter in the Tripuras ({%tripurasaṃ-%}
{%śrayaḥ%}) was procured for him by Maya with
the help of his {%māyā (tasmai kāmaṃ mayas%}
{%taṃ taṃ vidadhe māyayā tadā)%} 8. 24. 22;
(3) Hari, the son of Tārakākṣa, obtained
as a boon from Pitāmaha, a well in their
{%pura (vāpī bhavatu naḥ pure);%} if any
demon, wounded by weapons, was thrown
into this well, he arose from it stronger;
if a dead demon was thrown into it, he
came back alive ({%mṛtānāṃ jīvanīm%}); forti-
fied with this well the denizens of the
Tripuras oppressed all the three worlds
8. 24. 23-27. {@D.@} Mythological event:
Since Indra was unable to shatter the Tri-
puras, although he used all his weapons
against them, gods approached Rudra and
requested him to destroy the demons and
their cities; Śiva then burnt the three {%puras%}
together with the demons, using gods as
chariot ({%devān rathavaram kṛtvā%}), god
Viṣṇu as arrow, Agni as tip of the arrow
({%śalya%}), Yama as hind part of the arrow
({%puṅkha%}); Śiva's arrow had three joints
and three heads (to correspond to the
three {%puras ?%}) ({%triparvaṇā triśalyena … %}
{%śareṇa%}) 13. 145. 24-29; Śiva's chariot
was driven in the direction of the Tripuras
[Page531-a+ 40]
by Pitāmaha; Śiva employed his Pāśupata
missile on his bow and thought of the
Tripuras ({%tripuraṃ samacintayat%}) 8. 24.
115; at the appointed time the three {%puras%}
came together and were united; when they
came in his view, Śiva shot his arrow which
burnt the Tripuras and the demons in them
and threw them in the western ocean; thus
Maheśvara, wishing well for the three
worlds, burnt the Tripuras and the demons
8. 24. 114-121; this report in the Karṇa-
parvan of the downfall of the Tripuras
which was according to the account in the
Purāṇas is referred to in the Anukramaṇī-
parvan ({%ākhyātaṃ yatra paurāṇaṃ tripu-%}
{%rasya nipātanam%}) 1. 2. 169. {@E.@} Similies:
(1) The town Saubha, when cut into two
by the Sudarśanacakra of Kṛṣṇa, fell down
as did the Tripura when tossed up by the
arrow of Maheśvara ({%maheśvaraśaro-%}
{%ddhūtaṃ papāta tripuraṃ yathā%}) 3. 23. 34;
(2) Aśvatthāman, after burning an {%akṣau-%}
{%hiṇī%} army of the demons (of Ghaṭotkaca),
shone as Maheśvara formerly did in heaven
after burning the Tripura ({%pureva tṛipuraṃ%}
{%dagdhvā divi devo maheśvaraḥ%}) 7. 131. 98;
(3) The same simile is found when Karṇa
killed the demons (of Ghaṭotkaca) 7.
150. 83.
