{@Śukra<sup>1</sup>@}¦ m.: Name of the planet Venus,
also called {@Bhārgava@} (7. 143. 30).
{@A.@} Description: lustrous ({%tejasvin%})
12. 278. 5. {@B.@} History: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira
once asked Bhīṣma how Uśanas of im-
perishable lustre became Śukra and how he
acquired prosperity ({%kathaṃ cāpy uśanā%}
{%prāpa śuktratvam amaradyutiḥ/ṛddhiṃ%}
{%sa ca kathaṃ prāptaḥ%}) 12. 278. 4 (Nī.,
however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5 explains
{%śukratvaṃ as śukrotpannatvam,%} cf. {%sa viniṣ-%}
{%kramya śiśnena śukratvam abhipedivān%} 12.
278. 32); Yudhiṣṭhira also asked Bhīṣma
why does Śukra not move through the middle
of the sky ({%na yāti ca sa tejasvī madhyena%}
{%nabhasaḥ katham%}) 12. 278. 5; 12. 278. 32
(Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5:
{%tasya ākāśagatiḥ kutaḥ kuṇṭhitety arthaḥ/%}
{%saptarṣivad dvīrūpeṇa sthitasya śukrasya%}
{%bhūsthamūrtiviṣayaka evāyaṃ praśno na%}
{%bhacakrasthamūrtiviṣayaḥ tena yathā bhau-%}
[Page272-a+ 40]
{%mānāṃ vasiṣṭhādīnāṃ svarge 'pi gatir asti%}
{%naivaṃ bhaumasya śukrasyāstīti gamyate/%});
(2) Parāśara told Janaka that Uśanas be-
came Śukra by propitiating Devadeva (Śiva);
and by praising Devī (Umā) he, covered
with lustre, delights in the sky ({%gataḥ%}
{%śukratvam uśanā devadevaprasādanāt/%}
{%devīṃ stutvā tu gagane modate tejasā vṛtaḥ%})
12. 281. 14 (a reference to 12. 278. 13-37);
(3) Planet Śukra is the son of Kavi
({%śukraḥ kavisuto grahaḥ%}) 1. 60. 40 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 1. 66. 42: {%śukro graha-%}
{%tvād eva lokānāṃ prāṇayātrāyāṃ varṣā-%}
{%varṣādikārye niyuktaḥ%}) {@C.@} Importance:
(1) Śukra, along with other planets, visits
the {%sabhā%} of Brahman 2. 11. 20; (2) finds
place in the Daivatavaṃśa 13. 151. 12.
{@D.@} Name of Sūrya: Śukra appears as the 23rd
name in the list of the 108 names of Sūrya
taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 19.
{@E.@} Auspicious: (1) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra
heard that the planet Śukra and Sūrya
both together were favourable to the sons
of Kuntī for their victory in war he did
not hope to win ({%yadāśrauṣaṃ śukra-%}
{%sūryau ca yuktau kaunteyānām anulomau%}
{%jayāya … tadā nāsaṃse vijayāya saṃjaya//%})
1. 1. 129; (2) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira
that in wars, victory was on that side for
which wind, Sūrya and the planet Śukra were
favourable; if they all were simultaneously
present, each time the former was stronger
than the latter ({%yato vāyur yataḥ sūryo%}
{%yataḥ śukras tato jayaḥ/pūrvaṃ pūrvaṃ%}
{%jyāya eṣāṃ saṃnipāte yudhiṣṭhira%} 12. 101.
17. {@F.@} Bad effect: While Śukra is in
conjunction with the two Proṣṭhapadās it has
wealth (as Kubera, the lord of riches, also
has); Śukra in that position takes away from
men whatever they have earned according to
[Page272-b+ 40]
their desires 5. 112. 3 (for citation and Nī.'s
comm. see {@Pūrvā Bhādrapadā@}); (for Śukra
as a great sage and perfect in {%yoga%} depriv-
ing also Kubera of his wealth see 12. 278.
7-9). {@G.@} Omens: Among the bad omens
noticed by the Vyāsa before the war one was
related to Śukra's ascending the Pūrva
Proṣṭhapada and then, after going over to the
Uttara Proṣṭhapada, both looking back at
the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada 6. 3. 14 (for citation
see {@Uttarā Bhādrapadā@}). {@H.@} Similes:
(1) The battle between Drupada and Jaya-
dratha, delightful to the spectators ({%īkṣitṛ-%}
{%prītijananam%}), was like the one between
Śukra and Aṅgāraka 6. 43. 54; (2) Droṇa
and Arjuna met in battle like Budha and
Śukra in the sky ({%nabhastale%}) 6. 97. 57;
(3) The battle between Prativindhya and
Duḥśāsana was like the one between Budha
and Bhārgava (Śukra) in a cloudless sky
({%vyapetajalade vyomni%}) 7. 143. 30; (4)
Arjuna, with Kṛṣṇa and Sātyaki by his
side in the chariot, looked like the darkness-
destroying Śaśin with Budha and Śukra 7.
60. 20. [For {@Śukra@} also see Section 1. 7]
