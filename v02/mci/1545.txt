{@Mānasa<sup>2</sup>@}¦ m.: Name of a mountain.
<div n="P">Indra went to the Mānasa mountain in
search of a leader for the army of the gods
({%devasenā%}) which was overpowered by the
demons; there he heard the cry of a woman
(who was Devasenā); the two sisters Deva-
senā and Daityasenā, daughters of Prajāpati,
used to come there with their friends for
pleasure; from this mountain the demon
Keśin took away Daityasenā, who longed for
him, but Devasenā was rescued by Indra
