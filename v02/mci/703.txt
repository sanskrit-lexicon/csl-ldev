{@Jaya@}¦ m.: Name of a type of Itihāsa
<div n="lb">({%jayo nāmetihāso 'yam%}) 1. 56. 19; 5. 134.
<div n="lb">17; 18. 5. 39.
<div n="P">Usually this is considered to be the desi-
<div n="lb">gnation of that text which was originally
<div n="lb">composed by Vyāsa and later, with gradual
<div n="lb">additions, grew to become the Bhārata and the
[Page182-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">Mahābhārata at the hands of Vaiśāṃpāyana
<div n="lb">and Sūta Ugraśravas respectively; as the name
<div n="lb">of the Mahābhārata it probably occurs in the
<div n="lb">opening {%maṅgala śloka%} found at the begin-
<div n="lb">ning of the different {%parvans (nārāyaṇaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%namaskṛtya naraṃ caiva narottamam/%}
<div n="lb">{%devīṃ sarasvatīṃ caiva tato jayam udīra-%}
<div n="lb">{%yet//)%} which is not found in all the versions;
<div n="lb">according to V. S. Sukthankar, however,
<div n="lb">“ … Jaya is a {%generic%} name applicable to
<div n="lb">different works, and not a specific name of
<div n="lb">the Mahābhārata at all as believed by some
<div n="lb">writers” (Ādiparvan, p. 989, note on 56. 19);
<div n="lb">the recitation of this kind of Itihāsa should
<div n="lb">be heard by a king who desires victory; he
<div n="lb">then conquers the earth and shall defeat his
<div n="lb">enemies; it should also often be heard by a
<div n="lb">chief queen since it is as good as a rite
<div n="lb">calculated to lead to the birth of a son ({%puṃ-%}
<div n="lb">{%savanam%}) and by a crown prince since it
<div n="lb">is the royal road to welfare ({%svastyayanaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%mahat%}) 1. 56. 19-20; its recitation is re-
<div n="lb">commended for a king desiring prosperity
<div n="lb">({%bhūtim%}), for princes in general, and for
<div n="lb">any pregnant woman; it is also said that
<div n="lb">hearing it one who desires heaven will
<div n="lb">go to heaven, one who wants victory will
<div n="lb">win victory, and a pregnant woman will
<div n="lb">deliver a son or a fortunate girl ({%putraṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%kanyāṃ vā bahubhāginīm%}) 18. 5. 39-40; the
<div n="lb">narrative called the Vidurāputrānuśāsana
<div n="lb">(5. 131-135) is also classed as the Jaya
<div n="lb">type of Itihāsa 5. 134. 17; a minister should
<div n="lb">recite this to a king who is oppressed by his
<div n="lb">enemies and who is dejected since this tract,
<div n="lb">being a powerful exhortation, is best suited
<div n="lb">to cause increase in energy ({%idam uddha-%}
<div n="lb">{%raṇaṃ bhīmaṃ tejovardhanam uttamam%});
<div n="lb">the rest of the {%śravaṇaphala%} given here is
<div n="lb">the same as for the Mahābhārata (as a Jaya
[Page183-a+ 39]
<div n="lb">type of composition) with the addition which
<div n="lb">gives the qualities of the son to be born to
<div n="lb">a woman 5. 134. 16-21.
