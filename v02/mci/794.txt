{@Śatapatha@}¦ nt.: Name of a Vedic text
belonging to the White Yajurveda.
<div n="P">Described as a new Veda (lit. ‘which
did not exist before’) ({%vedam apūrvam%}) 12.
306. 23; God Sūrya blessed Yājñavalkya
with a boon and told him that goddess
Sarasvatī, in the form of speech, would enter
his body; he then asked Yājñavalkya to open
his mouth ({%sarasvatīha vāgbhūtā śarīraṃ%}
{%te pravekṣyati/tato mām āha bhagavān%}
{%āsyaṃ svaṃ vivṛtaṃ kuru/%}) 12. 306. 6-7;
Yājñavalkya was then to promulgate
the entire Śatapatha at the end of which
[Page210-b+ 40]
activity his mind would seek liberation
({%kṛtsnaṃ śatapathaṃ caiva praṇeṣyasi dvi-%}
{%jarṣabha/tasyānte cāpunarbhāve buddhis%}
{%tava bhaviṣyati%}) 12. 306. 11; (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 12. 319. 11: {%apunarbhāve mokṣe%}); later,
Yājñavalkya meditated on Sarasvatī and when
the goddess, adorned with vowels and conso-
nants, flashed before him, he offered her and
the god Sūrya a guest offering; he then
composed with great delight the entire Śata-
patha along with its secrets, and abstracts,
and supplements; he taught it to his hundred
pupils ({%tataḥ śatapathaṃ kṛtsnaṃ sara-%}
{%hasyaṃ sasaṃgraham/cakre sapariśeṣaṃ%}
{%ca harṣeṇa parameṇa ca//kṛtvā cādhyaya-%}
{%naṃ teṣāṃ śiṣyāṇāṃ śatam uttamam%}) 12.
306. 16-17; Yājñavalkya embarked on this
activity keeping before his mind the seed (in
the form of the fifteen {%yajuses%} which he had
obtained from god Sun ({%daśa pañca ca%}
{%prāptāni yajūṃṣya arkān mayānagha%} 12.
306. 21) and goddess Sarasvatī, and on
the strength of the authority conferred on
him by god Sūrya ({%bījam etat puraskṛtya%}
{%devīm caiva sarasvatīm/sūryasya cānu-%}
{%bhāvena pravṛtto 'haṃ narādhipa//%}) 12.
306. 22; he taught the whole of it to his
pupils and established fifteen branches of
learning revealed to him by Bhāskara (god
Sūrya) 12. 306. 24-25; a passage to the effect
that ‘if one who knows (the real significance)
gives an offering as a gift in the mouth of
a Brāhmaṇa it is as good as giving an
offering in kindled fire’ is supposed to occur
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa ({%śatapathe hi%}
{%brāhmaṇaṃ bhavati/agnau samiddhe sa%}
{%juhoti yo vidvān brāhmaṇamukhe dānā-%}
{%hutiṃ juhoti%}) 12. 329. 8.
