{@Sughoṣa@}¦ m.: Name of the conch of
Nakula.
<div n="P">On the first day of the war, when the
Kaurava and the Pāṇḍava armies were
arranged against each other, Nakula blew
his Sughoṣa conch 6. 23. 16; he blew it also
before the start of the war on the next day
6. 47. 26, (and very likely on all the following
days).
