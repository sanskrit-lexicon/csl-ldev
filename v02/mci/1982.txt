{@Māhiṣmatī@}¦ f.: Name of a city.
{@A.@} Location: In the south, near the
river Narmadā ({%prayayau dakṣiṇāṃ diśam%})
2. 28. 1; ({%dakṣiṇābhimukho yayau%}) 2. 28. 8;
({%narmadām abhito yayau%}) 2. 28. 9; ({%tathā%}
{%māhiṣmatīvāsī nīlaḥ … dakṣiṇāpathavāsi-%}
{%bhiḥ%}) 5. 19. 23. {@B.@} Characterized generally
as {%purī%} 2. 28. 11, 22-23, 34; once as
{%rāṣṭram%} 2. 28. 25. {@C.@} Special features:
(1) Agni always lived in the city of Māhiṣ-
matī ({%tataḥ sāṃnidhyam adyāpi māhiṣma-%}
{%tyāṃ vibhāvasoḥ%}) 13. 2. 32; ({%tatra māhiṣ-%}
{%matīvāsī bhagavān havyavāhanaḥ/śrūyate%})
2. 28. 17. (2) Under the rule of Duryo-
dhana (not Kaurava) his town and king-
dom ({%nagaraṃ viṣayaś cāsya%}) were full of
jewels, riches, cattle and different kinds of
corn ({%sasyaiś cāpi prthagvidhaiḥ%}) 13. 2. 14;
nobody in his kingdom ({%viṣaye%}) was wret-
ched, distressed, afflicted by disease, or
emaciated 13. 2. 15; (3) King Nīla asked
as a boon from Agni freedom from fear

[Page553-b+ 40]
{%nṛpam … abhayaṃ sa ca jagrāha svasainye%}
{%vai mahīpatiḥ//%}) 2. 28. 20-21; hence who-
ever wished to subjugate the city Māhi-
ṣmatī was burnt down by fire 2. 28. 22;
(4) Also as a result of the boon of Agni,
women of the city Māhiṣmatī, under the
rule of Nīla, could not be withheld from
their desire (?); so women of the town
were unrestrained and they behaved ac-
cording to their desire ({%tasyāṃ puryāṃ%}

{%svairiṇyas tatra nāryo hi yatheṣṭaṃ%}
{%pracaranty uta//%}) 2. 28. 23-24; (5)
Due to the fear of Agni kings avoided
that city ({%varjayanti ca rājānas tad rā-%}
{%ṣṭraṃ … /bhayād agner%}) 2. 28. 25; Agni
told Sahadeva that he would continue to
protect the city as long as the descendents
of Nīla ruled it 2. 28. 54. {@D.@} Epic events:
(1) Sahadeva in his expedition to the
south before the Rājasūya marched on
Māhiṣmatī from Avantī; Māhiṣmatī was
then ruled by king Nīla ({%purīṃ māhiṣma-%}
{%tīm yayau%}) 2. 28. 11; Sahadeva could not
subjugate it as it was protected by Agni
(2. 28. 26; 13. 2. 32); but when he pleased
Agni, the latter withdrew and Nīla recei-
ved Sahadeva ({%pāvake vinivṛtte tu nīlo%}
{%rājābhyayāt tadā/satkāreṇa … sahadevam%})
2. 28. 36; (2) King Nīla of Māhiṣmatī
went with his southern warriors, using
dark weapons (swords ?) to Duryodhana
to help him in war with the Pāṇḍavas
({%tato māhiṣmatīvāsī nīlo nīlāyudhaiḥ saha/%}
{%mahīpālo mahāvīryair dakṣiṇāpathavāsi-%}

ṣmatī, wearing dark armour and, fighting
with a host of chariot fighters, will des-

troy Duryodhana's enemies for he (Nīla)
has formerly formed enmity with Sahadeva
({%nīto māhiṣmatīvāsī nīlavarmadharas tava/%}
{%rathavaṃśena śatṛūṇāṃ kadanaṃ vai kari-%}

({%kṛtavairaḥ purā caiva sahadevena%}) 5. 163.
5 (a reference to 2. 28. 11-15). {@E.@} Past
events: (1) Daśāśva, the tenth son of
Ikṣvāku, once ruled Māhiṣmatī 13. 2. 6;
(2) In Daśāśva's lineage was born Duryo-
dhana; when Agni asked for Sudarśanā,
daughter of Duryodhana, the latter in
return asked as dowry ({%śulka%}) Agni's
continuous presence in Māhiṣmatī; hence
Agni was always present in Māhiṣmatī (13.
2. 31-32); Agni's presence in Māhiṣmatī
was witnessed by Sahadeva in his expedi-
tion before the Rājasūya ({%dṛṣṭaṃ hi saha-%}
{%devena diśo vijayatā tadā%}) 13. 2. 32 (a
reference to 2. 28. 13-15). (3) When
Arjuna Kārtavīrya ruled at Mahīṣmatī, he
ruled the entire earth ({%kārtavīryo 'bhavat%}
