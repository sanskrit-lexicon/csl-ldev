{@Dvāpara@}¦ m., nt.: Name of the third
Yuga among the four Yugas.
{@A.@} Place among the four Yugas:
Its place is third, mentioned after the Tretā
and before the Kali ({%kṛtaṃ tretā dvā-%}
{%paraṃ ca puṣyaṃ ca kuruvardhana%}) 6.
11. 3; 12. 224. 18; the Dvāpara starts
when the Tretā ends ({%tretānirmokṣasamaye%}
{%dvāparapratipādane%}) 12. 139. 14; and
the Kali starts when the Dvāpara ends
({%saṅkṣepād dvāparasyātha tataḥ puṣyaṃ%}
{%pravartate%}) 6. 11. 4; hence also the junctions
of the Tretā and the Dvāpara on the one
hand and of the Dvāpara and the Kali
on the other are referred to 1. 2. 3; 12.
139. 13; 12. 326. 78; 1. 2. 9; 12. 326. 82.
{@B.@} Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira
that the duration of the Dvāpara Yuga was
two thousand years with dawns and twilights
of two hundred years each at both ends ({%tathā%}
{%varṣasahasre dve dvāparaṃ parimāṇataḥ/%}
{%tasyāpi dviśatī saṃdhyā saṃdhyāṃśas ca%}
{%tataḥ param//saṃdhyāsaṃdhyāṃśayos tul-%}
{%yaṃ pramāṇam upadhāraya%}) 3. 186. 20-
21 (for Nī's explanation of {%saṃdhyā%} and
{%saṃdhyāṃśa%} see above {@Kali,@} section {@C,@}
p. 234); the same duration for the Dvāpara
was told by Vyāsa to Śuka without naming
the Yuga, but indicating it in relation to the
Kṛta 12. 224. 20. {@C.@} Events occurring
in the Dvāpara: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that formerly, at the junction of the
Tretā and the Dvāpara, there occurred a
terrible drought lasting for twelve years due
to the working of the fate ({%daivavidhi-%}
{%kramāt%}); when the Tretā was about to end
[Page252-b+ 40]
and the Dvāpara was to set in Indra did
not release rain for twelve years ({%tretānir-%}
{%mokṣasamaye dvāparapratipādane//na%}
{%vavarṣa sahasrākṣaḥ%}) 12. 139. 13-15; (2)
Sūta Ugraśravas told the sages assembled in
the Naimiṣa forest that at the junction of
the Tretā and the Dvāpara ({%tretādvāparayoḥ%}
{%saṃdhau%}) Rāma destroyed the princely
Kṣatriyas again and again 1. 2. 3 (but
see the next event); (3) Bhagavān (Nārā-
yaṇa) told Nārada that at the junction
of the Tretā and the Dvāpara ({%saṃdhau%}
{%tu samanuprāpte tretāyāṃ dvāparasya%}
{%ca%}) he would be born as Rāma, son of
Daśaratha 12. 326. 78; (4) Bhagavān
(Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that towards the end
of the junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali
({%dvāparasya kaleś caiva saṃdhau paryava-%}
{%sānike%}) he would be born in Mathurā for (the
killing of) Kaṃsa 12. 326. 82; (5) at the
junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali the
armies of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas fought
each other near Samantapañcaka 1. 2. 9. {@D.@}
Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) and the Dvāpara:
(1) Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārka-
ṇḍeya that he has red colour in the Dvāpara
Yuga ({%rakto dvāparam āsādya%}) 3. 187. 31;
but according to Hanūmant Viṣṇu becomes
yellow in the Dvāpara ({%dvāpare 'pi yuge … %}
{%viṣṇur vai pītatāṃ yāti%}) 3. 148. 26; (3)
Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was
strength in the Dvāpara ({%balaṃ tv āsīd dvā-%}
{%pare pārtha kṛṣṇaḥ%}) 13. 143. 9. {@E.@} King
and the Dvāpara: According to Utathya
Aṅgiras all the four Yugas depend on the
king's behaviour, hence a king himself is
called Yuga ({%rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva%}
{%yugam ucyate%}) 12. 92. 6; Bhīṣma had no
doubt that all the Yugas were rooted in
a king ({%rājamūlāni sarvāṇi mama nāsty%}
[Page253-a+ 40]
{%atra saṃśayaḥ%}) 12. 139. 10; it is the king
who created a Yuga—whether it was the
Kṛta, the Tretā, or the Dvāpara 5. 130. 16 =
12. 70. 25 (also cf. {%rājā kālasya kāraṇam%}
5. 130. 15 = 12. 70. 6); when a king gives
up half of the {%daṇḍanīti%} and practises only
one half of it, then the Dvāpara age sets
in ({%ardhaṃ tyaktvā yadā rājā nītyardham%}
{%anuvartate/tatas tu dvāparaṃ nāma sa%}
{%kālaḥ saṃpravartate//%}) 12. 70. 16; the
{%dharma%} practised by the king in the Dvāpara
is deficient in two quarters ({%dvāpare tu%}
{%dvipādena (ūnaḥ)%}) 12. 259. 32; by bringing
about the Dvāpara a king lives in heaven
only according to his share (i. e. not for a long
time) ({%pravartanād dvāparasya (svargam)%}
{%yathābhāgam ypāśnute%}) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70.
27; (description of the behaviour of people in
the Dvāpara in the absence of the {%daṇḍanīti%}
12. 65. 24-27). {@F.@} Dvāpara and {%dharma:%}
In the Dvāpara Yuga, {%dharma%} will lose two
of its four feet and the age will be marked
by a mixture (of {%dharma%} and {%adharma%})
({%tato vai dvāparaṃ nāma miśraḥ kālo%}
{%bhaviṣyati/dvipādahīno dharmaś ca yuge%}
{%tasmin bhaviṣyati%}) 12. 327. 75; ({%dvāpare%}
{%'rdhena vyāmiśro dharma ucyate%}) 3. 188.
11 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 190. 10: {%ardhena%}
{%adharmeṇa%}); ({%aśubhasya tadā ardhaṃ dvāv%}
{%aṃśāv anuvartate%}) 12. 70. 17; ({%dvāpare 'pi%}
{%yuge dharmo dvibhāgonaḥ pravartate%}) 3.
148. 26; 12. 259. 32; in the Yugas that
follow the Kṛta the traditional {%dharma%} is
displaced successively by one quarter and in-
stead {%adharma%} increases due to the practice
of theft, falsehood and deceit 12. 224. 23; the
{%dharmas%} in the Dvāpara are different from
those in the Kṛta and the Tretā 12. 224. 26 =
12. 252. 8; according to Mārkaṇḍeya, however,
the {%dharma%} for the Kṛta, the Tretā and the
[Page253-b+ 40]
Dvāpara was the same ({%eṣa ḍharmaḥ kṛta-%}
{%yuge tretāyāṃ dvāpare tathā%}) 3. 189. 13;
sacrifice was considered to be the best {%dharma%}
for the Dvāpara ({%dvāpare yajñam evāhuḥ%}
{%(uttamam)%}) 12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told
Bhīma that the times in different Yugas were
different; he and Bhīma lived at a time when
the Dvāpara was about to end and hence he
could not assume the form he had taken in
the earlier Yuga ({%ayaṃ pradhvaṃsanaḥ kālo%}
{%nādya tad rūpam asti me%}) 3. 148. 6;
Kṛṣṇa-Vāsudeva, along with Saṃkaraṣṇa, is
praised following the Sātvata rites when the
Dvāpara ends, and the Kali begins ({%dvāpa-%}
{%rasya yugasyānte ādau kaliyugasya ca/%}
{%sātvataṃ vidhiṃ āsthāya gītaḥ saṃkarṣaṇena%}
{%yaḥ%} (i. e. {%kṛṣṇaḥ%}) 6. 62. 39. {@G.@} Dvāpara,
sacrifice and the Vedas: Vyāsa told his son
Śuka that on account of the limitation on the
life expectancy (of human beings) sacrifices,
in the Dvāparayuga, get into disarray ({%saṃrc-%}
{%dhād āyuṣas tv ete%} (i. e. {%yajñāḥ%}) {%vyasyante%}
{%dvāpare yuge%}) 12. 224. 65 = 12. 230. 14;
they fall into ruin ({%dvāpare viplavaṃ yānti%}
{%yajñāḥ%}) 12. 224. 62 = 12. 230. 15 ({%viplavaṃ%}
{%yānti vedāḥ%}); however, sacrifice considered
to be the best {%dharma%} for the Dvāpara
({%dvāpare yajñam evāhuḥ (uttamam)%} 12.
224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that in the
Dvāpara the Veda is foretold; hence some
study all the four Vedas, others three, two,
or one; but some do not study a single {%ṛc;%} as
men did not realize the sacred text to be one
Veda, the Veda was divided into many
(Vedas) ({%dvāpare 'pi yuge … caturdhā%}
{%veda eva ca//tato 'nye ca caturvedās%}
{%trivedāś ca tathāpare/dvivedāś caikavedāś-%}
{%cāpy anṛcaś ca tathāpare// … ekavedasya%}
{%cājñānād vedās te bahavaḥ kṛtāḥ%}) 3. 148.
26-27, 29 (Nī., on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 28,
[Page254-a+ 40]
offers an alternative explanation: {%yad vā%}

(Viṣṇu) recommending the performance of
sacrifices to satisfy the gods and the gods,
on their part, sustaining the worlds in the
(three) Yugas other than the Kṛta 12. 327.
53-60). {@H.@} Nature: According to the
description of the Dvāpara given by Hanū-
mant to Bhīma, since in that age the Vedas
become fourfold and the {%śāstras%} multiply,
the Vedic rites are variously performed;
people, given to austerities and gifts, become
{%rājasa%} by nature; since truth falls down,
rarely any one abides by truth ({%evaṃ%}
{%śāstreṣu bhinneṣu bahudhā niyate kṛiyā/%}
{%tapodānapravṛttā ca rājasī bhavati prajā//%}
{% … satyasya ceha vibhraṃśāt satye kaścid%}
{%avasthitaḥ//%}) 3. 148. 28-29; for further
description of the Dvāpara cf. 3. 148. 30-31;
Hanūmant concludes that people in the
Dvāpara perish due to the practice of
{%adharma (evaṃ dvāparam āsādya prajāḥ%}
{%kṣīyanty adharmataḥ)%} 3. 148. 32; according
to Saṃjaya, in the Dvāpara all the four
{%varṇas%} are full of energy; they are great
heroes, desirous of killing each other; on the
whole, the Dvāpara in which Saṃjaya lived
was characterized by contraction (of the me-
rits in all respects) ({%sarvavarṇā mahārāja%}
{%jāyante dvāpare sati/mahotsāhā mahāvīr-%}
{%yāḥ parasparavadhaiṣiṇaḥ// … saṃkṣepo%}
{%vartate rājan dvāpare 'smin narādhipa%})
6. 11. 11, 14 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 10. 15:
[Page254-b+ 40]
{%saṃkṣepo guṇānām iti śeṣaḥ%}); Vyāsa told
Śuka that all the {%varṇas%} and the {%āśramas%}
fall into disarray due to the limitation on
the life-span ({%varṇāśramās tathā/saṃrc-%}
{%dhād āyuṣas tv ete vyasyante dvāpare%}
{%yuge%}) 12. 230. 14; he also said that people
in the Dvāpara (as in the Tretā and the Kali)
entertain doubt ({%tretāyāṃ dvāpare caiva%}
{%kalijāś ca sasaṃśayāḥ%} 12. 230. 7) as to
what is at the root of a man's success—
his effort, fate, or nature 12. 230. 4; in the
Dvāpara, the earth has to be ploughed and
even then it does not yield much harvest
({%kṛṣṭapacyaiva pṛthivī bhavaty alpaphalā%}
{%tathā%}) 12. 70. 17; in this Yuga people have to
copulate to beget progeny ({%dvāpare maithuno%}
{%dharmaḥ prajānām abhavan nṛpa%}) 12. 200.
37; evil tribes like the Talavaras and the
Andharkas from the south and the Yaunas
(Yavanas) and the Gāndhāras from the
north move on earth from the Tretā onwards
(i. e. also in the Dvāpara) 12. 200. 39-40, 42.
{@I.@} Life expectancy: Vyāsa told his son
Śuka that the life expectancy of people dimini-
shes by a quarter in each succeeding Yuga
after the Kṛta, hence in the Dvāpara they
live for two hundred years ({% … tretādiṣv%}
{%eteṣāṃ pādaśo hrasate vayaḥ%}) 12. 224. 24;
Vyāsa also told Śuka that according to his
information life expectancy of people, along
with other things, gradually decreased in the
successive Yugas ({% … anuyugaṃ hrasantīti%}
{%ca naḥ śrutam/āyūṃṣi … %}) 12. 224. 25;
this is also what Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira ({%āyur … manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṃ%}
{%hrasatīti nibodha me%}) 3. 188. 13; according
to Saṃjaya, however, the life expectancy of
people in the Dvāpara was two thousand
years ({%āyuḥsaṃkhyā … saṃktyātā … /dvi-%}
{%sahasraṃ dvāpare tu%}) 6. 11. 5-6 (ap-
[Page255-a+ 40]
parently Saṃjaya made confusion between
the duration of the Dvāpara age and the
life expectancy of people in that Yuga).
{@J.@} Simile: The place where the river
Narmadā passes along the Vaiḍūrya moun-
tain is compared to the junction of the Tretā
(f.) and the Dvāpara (m.) 3. 121. 18-19.
{@K.@} Name of Sūrya: Dvāpara appears as
48th name among the hundred and eight
names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to
Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words {%kṛta, tretā,%}
{%dvāpara%} and {%kali%} occurring in 5. 140. 7-15
are wrongly interpreted by Nīlakaṇṭha (Bom.
Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the four Yugas,
and not as the names of the throws in the
game of dice].
