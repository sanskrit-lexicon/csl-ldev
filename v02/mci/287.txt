{@Lapitā@}¦ f.: A female Śārṅgikā bird.
<div n="P">The great sage Mandapāla, turned into
<div n="lb">a {%Śārṅgaka%} bird, first approached the Śārṅ-
<div n="lb">gikā Jaritā, but later transferred his attention
<div n="lb">to Lapitā 1. 220. 17; at the time of the
<div n="lb">Khāṇḍava fire, when Mandapāla expressed
[Page050-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">his anxiety about the safety of his young
<div n="lb">ones, Lapitā became jealous and said that
<div n="lb">Mandapāla was not really anxious for his
<div n="lb">young sons but for Jaritā, his first love;
<div n="lb">she knew that his children were powerful,
<div n="lb">lustrous, and able speakers; they need have
<div n="lb">no fear from fire; moreover Mandapāla had
<div n="lb">in her presence secured an assurance from
<div n="lb">god Agni that he would not harm Manda-
<div n="lb">pāla's children; Lapitā therefore was sure
<div n="lb">that Mandapāla was really worried about
<div n="lb">Jaritā, her foe; she charged Mandapāla that
<div n="lb">he did not love her as he loved Jaritā and
<div n="lb">asked him to go to Jaritā and leave her alone
<div n="lb">1. 224. 2-13.
