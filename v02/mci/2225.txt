thern (14. 69. 19), also referred to as

cular); the term often signifies the des-
cendants of Kuru or the the Kuru family in
general (also called {@Kuruvaṃśa@}), or the
descendants of Kuru sitting in the assembly
of the Kauravas; very often it signifies the

(in which case the term occasionally in-
cludes heroes like Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa or
the Saṃśaptakas (8. 59. 1, 3), or some-
times it refers even to the Kaurava army
in general; sometimes the term {@Kuravaḥ@}
includes the Pāṇḍavas and their descendants
(Abhimanyu, Parikṣit and Janamejaya), or,
as opposed to the Pāṇḍavas, the term is
[Page667-b+ 40]
restricted to refer to the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
(otherwise called Kauravas).

no one took delight in unlawful acts; in
all parts of the Kuru country, Kṛta yuga
prevailed; people, free from pride, anger
and greed, helped one another to prosper;
there were tall houses and people sported in
rivers, ponds and forest tracts; people
of the southern Kurus as though vied
with those of the Uttarakurus (see p. 635

suffer from widowhood; wells, gardens,

remember him from among the Kurus; while
playing the game of dice, Vidura wonder-
