{@Ulūpī@}¦ f.: A Nāga princess ({%pannagī%}
1. 206. 18; {%bhujaṅgamā%} 1. 206. 23).
{@A.@} Early life: Daughter of Nāgarāja
Airāvata (daughter not named here, but appa-
rently identical with Ulūpī); married first to
a {%nāga%} who was killed by Suparṇa; she had
no child; next, given by her father as wife
to Arjuna 6. 86. 6-8; her son Irāvant called
a {%dāyāda%} of Arjuna 6. 86. 11; yet Irāvant
described as the son fathered by Arjuna on
the wife of another person ({%parakṣetra%}) 6.
86. 11 [apparently {%parakṣetra%} here intended
to mean that Ulūpī was a widow when married
to Arjuna; no mention in this narration of
Ulūpī's amorous advance ({%sāhasa%}) to Arjuna
1. 206. 17.] {@B.@} Meeting with Arjuna:
described in the {%Arjunavanavāsaparvan%} 1.
2. 91 = 1. 206; she saw Arjuna while bathing
in Gaṅgā; fell in love with him and dragged
him into water; on enquiry she told Arjuna
[Page006-b+ 41]
she was the daughter of the serpent ({%pannaga%})
Kauravya born in the family of Airāvata; she
requested Arjuna to make her happy by
uniting with her; she pleaded that he would
not thereby violate his vow to observe
celibacy for twelve years since, by uniting
with her, he would be offering protection to
the distressed and would be saving her life;
Arjuna agreed to her request 1. 206. 13-33
[No mention in this narration of Arjuna's
marrying her]. {@C.@} Role in Arjuna's battle
with Babhruvāhana: Ulūpī enraged when
Arjuna rebuked her ‘son’ Babhruvāhana for
not offering a fight; she who was versed in the
duties of a Kṣatriya ({%kṣātradharmaviśāradā%}
14. 78. 10), therefore broke open the earth and
appeared on the scene; she introduced herself
to Babhruvāhana as his mother and asked him
to fight with Arjuna 14. 78. 8-13; Citrāṅgadā,
mistaking Arjuna and Babhruvāhana to be
dead when they fell unconscious on the
ground in the armed conflict that followed,
scolded Ulūpī for inciting Babhruvāhana to
offer a fight; she requested Ulūpī to bring
Arjuna to life, not minding the death of
Babhruvāhana 14. 79. 2-7, 12-17; Babh-
ruvāhana, on gaining consciousness scolded
Ulūpī for the same reason 14. 80. 13-15; Ulūpī
told Babhruvāhana that Arjuna was not really
dead but was in a swoon as she had employed
{%mohinī māyā;%} she asked Babhruvāhana to fight
because Arjuna wanted to put his strength
to test; she then thought of the {%saṅjīvana%}
{%maṇi%} and asked Babhruvāhana to place it
on Arjuna's chest to bring him back to
consciousness 14. 81. 2, 4-7, 9-10; Arjuna,
when revived, asked Ulūpī the reason for her
presence on the battle-field 14. 82. 1-4; she told
Arjuna that what she did was for the atonement
({%niṣkṛti%}) and pacification ({%śānti%}) through his
son for his sinful act in felling down Bhīṣma in
[Page007-a+ 39]
an unlawful way ({%adharmeṇa%}) 14. 82. 8-11;
when Bhīṣma fell, Vasus cursed Arjuna, where-
upon Ulūpī requested her father to intercede on
behalf of Arjuna; Ulūpī's inciting Babhru-
vāhana was to release Arjuna from that curse;
Arjuna expressed satisfaction at what Ulūpī
had done 14. 82. 15-22; Arjuna invited
Babhruvāhana to attend the Aśvamedha
with his two mothers (Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā)
and took leave of his wives 14. 82. 24, 32.
{@D.@} Later life and End: She was one of those
who waited on Gāndhārī 15. 1. 21; Sāmba, a
Brāhmaṇa assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra on behalf of
his subjects that neither Kuntī, nor Draupadī,
nor Ulūpī, nor Subhadrā would do anything
harmful to the people 15. 16. 20; she entered
Gaṅgā when the Pāṇḍavas finally left Hās-
tinapura 17. 1. 25. {@E.@} Epithets: {%panna-%}
