{@Ulūpī@}¦ f.: A Nāga princess ({%pannagī%}
<div n="lb">1. 206. 18; {%bhujaṅgamā%} 1. 206. 23).
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Early life: Daughter of Nāgarāja
<div n="lb">Airāvata (daughter not named here, but appa-
<div n="lb">rently identical with Ulūpī); married first to
<div n="lb">a {%nāga%} who was killed by Suparṇa; she had
<div n="lb">no child; next, given by her father as wife
<div n="lb">to Arjuna 6. 86. 6-8; her son Irāvant called
<div n="lb">a {%dāyāda%} of Arjuna 6. 86. 11; yet Irāvant
<div n="lb">described as the son fathered by Arjuna on
<div n="lb">the wife of another person ({%parakṣetra%}) 6.
<div n="lb">86. 11 [apparently {%parakṣetra%} here intended
<div n="lb">to mean that Ulūpī was a widow when married
<div n="lb">to Arjuna; no mention in this narration of
<div n="lb">Ulūpī's amorous advance ({%sāhasa%}) to Arjuna
<div n="lb">1. 206. 17.] {@B.@} Meeting with Arjuna:
<div n="lb">described in the {%Arjunavanavāsaparvan%} 1.
<div n="lb">2. 91 = 1. 206; she saw Arjuna while bathing
<div n="lb">in Gaṅgā; fell in love with him and dragged
<div n="lb">him into water; on enquiry she told Arjuna
[Page006-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">she was the daughter of the serpent ({%pannaga%})
<div n="lb">Kauravya born in the family of Airāvata; she
<div n="lb">requested Arjuna to make her happy by
<div n="lb">uniting with her; she pleaded that he would
<div n="lb">not thereby violate his vow to observe
<div n="lb">celibacy for twelve years since, by uniting
<div n="lb">with her, he would be offering protection to
<div n="lb">the distressed and would be saving her life;
<div n="lb">Arjuna agreed to her request 1. 206. 13-33
<div n="lb">[No mention in this narration of Arjuna's
<div n="lb">marrying her]. {@C.@} Role in Arjuna's battle
<div n="lb">with Babhruvāhana: Ulūpī enraged when
<div n="lb">Arjuna rebuked her ‘son’ Babhruvāhana for
<div n="lb">not offering a fight; she who was versed in the
<div n="lb">duties of a Kṣatriya ({%kṣātradharmaviśāradā%}
<div n="lb">14. 78. 10), therefore broke open the earth and
<div n="lb">appeared on the scene; she introduced herself
<div n="lb">to Babhruvāhana as his mother and asked him
<div n="lb">to fight with Arjuna 14. 78. 8-13; Citrāṅgadā,
<div n="lb">mistaking Arjuna and Babhruvāhana to be
<div n="lb">dead when they fell unconscious on the
<div n="lb">ground in the armed conflict that followed,
<div n="lb">scolded Ulūpī for inciting Babhruvāhana to
<div n="lb">offer a fight; she requested Ulūpī to bring
<div n="lb">Arjuna to life, not minding the death of
<div n="lb">Babhruvāhana 14. 79. 2-7, 12-17; Babh-
<div n="lb">ruvāhana, on gaining consciousness scolded
<div n="lb">Ulūpī for the same reason 14. 80. 13-15; Ulūpī
<div n="lb">told Babhruvāhana that Arjuna was not really
<div n="lb">dead but was in a swoon as she had employed
<div n="lb">{%mohinī māyā;%} she asked Babhruvāhana to fight
<div n="lb">because Arjuna wanted to put his strength
<div n="lb">to test; she then thought of the {%saṅjīvana%}
<div n="lb">{%maṇi%} and asked Babhruvāhana to place it
<div n="lb">on Arjuna's chest to bring him back to
<div n="lb">consciousness 14. 81. 2, 4-7, 9-10; Arjuna,
<div n="lb">when revived, asked Ulūpī the reason for her
<div n="lb">presence on the battle-field 14. 82. 1-4; she told
<div n="lb">Arjuna that what she did was for the atonement
<div n="lb">({%niṣkṛti%}) and pacification ({%śānti%}) through his
<div n="lb">son for his sinful act in felling down Bhīṣma in
[Page007-a+ 39]
<div n="lb">an unlawful way ({%adharmeṇa%}) 14. 82. 8-11;
<div n="lb">when Bhīṣma fell, Vasus cursed Arjuna, where-
<div n="lb">upon Ulūpī requested her father to intercede on
<div n="lb">behalf of Arjuna; Ulūpī's inciting Babhru-
<div n="lb">vāhana was to release Arjuna from that curse;
<div n="lb">Arjuna expressed satisfaction at what Ulūpī
<div n="lb">had done 14. 82. 15-22; Arjuna invited
<div n="lb">Babhruvāhana to attend the Aśvamedha
<div n="lb">with his two mothers (Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā)
<div n="lb">and took leave of his wives 14. 82. 24, 32.
<div n="lb">{@D.@} Later life and End: She was one of those
<div n="lb">who waited on Gāndhārī 15. 1. 21; Sāmba, a
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra on behalf of
<div n="lb">his subjects that neither Kuntī, nor Draupadī,
<div n="lb">nor Ulūpī, nor Subhadrā would do anything
<div n="lb">harmful to the people 15. 16. 20; she entered
<div n="lb">Gaṅgā when the Pāṇḍavas finally left Hās-
