<div n="lb">the Khāṇḍava forest where Asura Maya happ-
<div n="lb">ened to stay at the time of the great fire 1.
<div n="lb">215. 7; 1. 219. 35; Uttaṅka, in his praise of
<div n="lb">the {%nāgas,%} referred to Takṣaka as living in
<div n="lb">Khāṇḍava near Kurukṣetra, along the river
<div n="lb">Ikṣumatī 1. 3. 142-146. {@C.@} Status: Second

<div n="lb">was of blazing lustre ({%tigmatejas%}), his poison
<div n="lb">acted like fire and burnt the being he bit

<div n="lb">({%āśīviṣa%}) 1. 37. 13; lotus-coloured ({%padma-%}
<div n="lb">{%varcas%}) 1. 40. 3; he was called by Uttaṅka

<div n="lb">46. 36, 40; {%duṣṭāntarātman%} 1. 3. 185, 187),
<div n="lb">and by Janamejaya ‘sinful’ ({%pāpa%}) 1. 46. 37.
<div n="lb">{@E.@} Khāṇḍava incident: Since Takṣaka lived
<div n="lb">in the Khāṇḍava forest, whenever god Fire
<div n="lb">tried to burn it, Indra, being Takṣaka's
<div n="lb">friend, he immediately extinguished the fire
<div n="lb">1. 215. 7; when the forest was finally on
<div n="lb">fire, Takṣaka was not in Khāṇḍava but
<div n="lb">was safe at Kurukṣetra 1. 218. 4; Indra
<div n="lb">was informed of this by an invisible
<div n="lb">voice 1. 219. 12-13. {@F.@} Takṣaka and the
<div n="lb">{%kuṇḍalas:%} Uttaṅka informed by Pauṣyaś
<div n="lb">wife ({%kṣatriyā%}) while handing over her ear-
<div n="lb">rings to him that Takṣaka coveted them;
<div n="lb">Uttaṅka assured her that Takṣaka would not
<div n="lb">be able to attack him 1. 3. 119-120; Tak-
<div n="lb">ṣaka assumed the form of a naked mendi-
<div n="lb">cant ({%nagna śramaṇa%}) and followed Uttaṅka
<div n="lb">on way; he took the {%kuṇḍalas,%} placed by
<div n="lb">Uttaṅka on the ground, and ran away; when
<div n="lb">caught by Uttaṅka, Takṣaka assumed his
<div n="lb">original form and suddenly entered a big hole;
<div n="lb">on reaching {%nāgaloka%} he entered his residence
<div n="lb">({%svabhavana%}); Uttaṅka went behind him
<div n="lb">1. 3. 136-138; when the {%nāgaloka%} was filled
<div n="lb">with smoke issuing from the anus of a horse
<div n="lb">(really god Agni) the confused Takṣaka,
<div n="lb">frightened by the heat of fire, returned the
<div n="lb">{%kuṇḍalas%} to Uttaṅka 1. 3. 158-159; when
<div n="lb">asked by the teacher the cause for delay in
<div n="lb">getting the {%kuṇḍalas,%} Uttaṅka told him the
<div n="lb">hindrance caused by Takṣaka 1. 3. 165-166;
<div n="lb">angered by this incident Uttaṅka started for
<div n="lb">Hāstinapura to take revenge on Takṣaka
<div n="lb">1. 3. 177. {@G.@} Death of Parikṣit: Due to
<div n="lb">the curse pronounced by Śṛṅgin king Parikṣit
<div n="lb">was destined to die within a week due to
<div n="lb">the burning lustre of the eminent serpent
[Page027-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">Takṣaka 1. 37. 13-14, 19; 1. 46. 8-10;
<div n="lb">Śṛṅgin's father informed Parikṣit about
<div n="lb">his impending death at the hands of Takṣaka
<div n="lb">1. 38. 19; 1. 46. 12-13; Kāśyapa, an eminent
<div n="lb">sage ({%munipuṃgava%} 1. 38. 35), who knew the
<div n="lb">cure for serpent bites started for Hāstinapura
<div n="lb">to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka and acquire
<div n="lb">wealth 1. 38. 31-33; Takṣaka, in disguise of
<div n="lb">an aged Brāhmaṇa, met Kāśyapa on way and
<div n="lb">asked him the reason for his hurrying on the
<div n="lb">way; Kāśyapa told Takṣaka that he wanted
<div n="lb">to cure Parikṣit when he would be burnt by
<div n="lb">the fire of Taṣaka's lustre ({%tejasā 'dya%}
<div n="lb">{%pradhakṣyati%}); then Takṣaka revealed his
<div n="lb">identity and told Kāśyapa that he would not
<div n="lb">be able to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka's bite;
<div n="lb">Kāśyapa retorted that he was confident about
<div n="lb">the strength of his science ({%vidyābala%}) 1. 38.
<div n="lb">34-39; 1. 46. 15-17; Takṣaka challenged
<div n="lb">Kāśyapa to bring back to life a {%nyagrodha%}
<div n="lb">bitten and burnt by him; this was done by
<div n="lb">Kāśyapa by his {%vidyābala%} 1. 39. 1-10;
<div n="lb">astonished, Takṣaka promised to give Kāśyapa
<div n="lb">all the wealth he desired from Parikṣit, and
<div n="lb">even more, and begged him to return; he also
<div n="lb">told Kaśyapa that the curse of the sage was
<div n="lb">bound to come true, and if Kāśyapa was not
<div n="lb">able to save Parikṣit he would lose his reputa-
<div n="lb">tion; having received from Takṣaka the wealth
<div n="lb">he wanted Kāśyapa turned back 1. 39. 11-19;
<div n="lb">1. 46. 18-21; Takṣaka then started for Hās-
<div n="lb">tinapura; on way he learnt about the arrange-
<div n="lb">ments made to save Parikṣit with the help of
<div n="lb">{%mantras%} and medicines which worked as cures
<div n="lb">for poison ({%mantrāgadair viṣaharaiḥ%} 1. 39.
<div n="lb">21); Takṣaka planned to deceive Parikṣit with
<div n="lb">some trick ({%māyāyoga%}) and sent to the king
<div n="lb">serpents in the disguise of hermits with fruits,
<div n="lb">leaves, and water; when the seventh day since
<div n="lb">the curse was uttered was about to end Pari-
<div n="lb">kṣit felt himself secure; he found a small
[Page027-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">worm in the fruit held by him and said (in
<div n="lb">joke): “may this small worm turn into
<div n="lb">Takṣaka and bite me” ({%kṛmiko māṃ daśatv%}
<div n="lb">{%ayam takṣako nāma bhūtvā vai%} 1. 39.
<div n="lb">31) and put it on his neck; immediately
<div n="lb">Takṣaka coiled around the king with his body
<div n="lb">({%bhoga%}) 1. 39. 22-33; the ministers of the
<div n="lb">king cried and fled; they saw a wonderful
<div n="lb">({%adbhuta%}) serpent rising up in the sky 1. 40.
<div n="lb">1-3; the whole house was on fire due to the
<div n="lb">heat of the serpent's poison; Parikṣit died due
<div n="lb">to the fire ({%tejas%}) of Takṣaka's poison 1. 40.
<div n="lb">4-5; ({%chadmenopetya takṣakaḥ … dagdhavān%}
<div n="lb">{%viṣavahninā%} 1. 46. 22-23). {@H.@} Snake-
<div n="lb">sacrifice: Uttaṅka, embittered by Tak-
<div n="lb">ṣaka due to the obstacle put by him in
<div n="lb">Uttaṅka's way, reported to Janamejaya how
<div n="lb">Takṣaka was responsible for his father's
<div n="lb">death, and instigated him to burn Takṣaka
<div n="lb">in the fire of a {%sarpasatra%} 1. 3. 177-190;
<div n="lb">when Janamejaya enquired with his mini-
<div n="lb">sters they told him how his father was killed
<div n="lb">by Takṣaka (1. 45. 19-28; 1. 46. 1-25);
<div n="lb">Janamejaya again asked them how they could
<div n="lb">know the conversation between the Panna-
<div n="lb">gendra (i. e. Takṣaka) and Kāśyapa when,
<div n="lb">apparently, it took place in a secluded place
<div n="lb">in the forest; if satisfied with their expla-
<div n="lb">nation he would think of the means to kill
<div n="lb">the serpents ({%vidhāsyāmi pannagāntakarīṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%matim%}) 1. 46. 26-27; the ministers reported
<div n="lb">that a man happened to mount the tree
<div n="lb">before it was burnt by Takṣaka; this man
<div n="lb">had heard the dialogue between Takṣaka and
<div n="lb">Kāśyapa; the man too was burnt with the tree;
<div n="lb">when brought back to life along with the
<div n="lb">tree the man returned to the town and
<div n="lb">reported the incident to others 1. 46. 28-31;
<div n="lb">Janamejaya, satisfied with this account,
<div n="lb">decided to avenge the death of his father by
<div n="lb">killing serpents for it was the evil-minded
[Page028-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">Takṣaka who had offered wealth to Kāśyapa
<div n="lb">and persuaded him not to go to Hāstina-
<div n="lb">pura 1. 46. 35-41; Janamejaya wished to
<div n="lb">know from his house-priest if there was any
<div n="lb">rite by which he could get Takṣaka and his
<div n="lb">relatives in the kindled fire; just as Takṣaka
<div n="lb">had burnt Parikṣit by the fire of his poison
<div n="lb">({%viṣāgni%}), so too Janamejaya wished to burn
<div n="lb">the serpent; priests informed Janamejaya about
<div n="lb">a rite known as {%sarpasatra,%} not performed by
<div n="lb">any one before; thereupon Janamejaya con-
<div n="lb">sidered Takṣaka as good as burnt in the sacri-
<div n="lb">ficial fire 1. 47. 3-8; Takṣaka having come
<div n="lb">to know of the {%sarpasatra%} went to Indra and
<div n="lb">sought his shelter; Indra had already propitia-
<div n="lb">ted Pitāmaha on Takṣaka's behalf and there-
<div n="lb">fore assured Takṣaka that there was no danger
<div n="lb">to his life from the fire of {%sarpasatra;%}
<div n="lb">Takṣaka then lived happily in Indra's dwelling
<div n="lb">1. 48. 14-18; in the meantime when the snake
<div n="lb">sacrifice was in progress Āstīka appeared at
<div n="lb">the place of sacrifice where serpents were
<div n="lb">falling in the fire in large numbers; he praised
<div n="lb">king Janamejaya; pleased, Janamejaya desired
<div n="lb">to offer a boon to Āstīka and asked permis-
<div n="lb">sion of the officiating priests; they gave the
<div n="lb">permission since Takṣaka was to arrive soon;
<div n="lb">but the {%hotṛ%} priest told Janamejaya that
<div n="lb">Takṣaka was not showing; Janamejaya asked
<div n="lb">the priests to spare no pains and get Takṣaka
<div n="lb">quickly; the priests told the king that as the
<div n="lb">Śāstras informed them and as the Fire narrat-
<div n="lb">ed to them Takṣaka, out of fear, had taken
<div n="lb">shelter with Indra 1. 51. 1-5 ({%yathā śāstrāṇi%}
<div n="lb">{%naḥ prāhur yathā śaṃsati pāvakaḥ/indrasya%}
<div n="lb">{%bhavane rājaṃs takṣako bhayapīḍitaḥ%}); the
<div n="lb">king's bard Lohitākṣa, who knew what had
<div n="lb">transpired ({%paurāṇiko veditavān purastāt%}
<div n="lb">1. 51. 6), confirmed what the priests had told
<div n="lb">the king; he said that Indra had asked
<div n="lb">Takṣaka to stay with him and feel free from
[Page028-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">any danger from fire; Janamejaya urged his
<div n="lb">{%hotṛ%} priest to proceed and the priest with his
<div n="lb">{%mantras%} called Indra himself; Indra appeared
<div n="lb">on the scene with the serpent tucked to his
<div n="lb">{%uttarīya;%} Janamejaya asked the priests to make
<div n="lb">Takṣaka fall in the fire with Indra if he sought
<div n="lb">shelter in Indra's residence; priests told Jana-
<div n="lb">mejaya, as they heard a thunderous roar, that
<div n="lb">Takṣaka was coming under the king's control,
<div n="lb">they were sure that the serpent was dropped
<div n="lb">down by Indra and was falling from his lap,
<div n="lb">the serpent's body was loosened by the
<div n="lb">{%mantras (mantravisrastakāyaḥ%} 1. 51. 13)
<div n="lb">and he had lost consciousness; they permitted
<div n="lb">Janamejaya to grant a boon to Āstīka since
<div n="lb">the rite was progressing according to the pres-
<div n="lb">cription and as Takṣaka was about to fall
<div n="lb">into the fire; Āstīka chose the boon: “let
<div n="lb">this sacrificial session come to an end, and
<div n="lb">let no more serpents fall (into the fire)”
<div n="lb">({%satraṃ te viramatv etan na pateyur ihora-%}
<div n="lb">{%gāḥ%} 1. 51. 17); in vain did Janamejaya try
<div n="lb">to persuade Āstīka to choose another boon;
<div n="lb">Janamejaya agreed to stop the session and
<div n="lb">granted freedom from risk to serpents 1.
<div n="lb">51. 6-23; 1. 53. 8; Āstīka admitted that
<div n="lb">Takṣaka was somehow saved because Jana-
<div n="lb">mejaya followed the path of truth (and kept
<div n="lb">his word) ({%kathaṃcit takṣako muktaḥ satya-%}
<div n="lb">{%tvāt tava pārthiva%}) 15. 43. 14; Sūta called
<div n="lb">it a great miracle of Āstīka that when Tak-
<div n="lb">ṣaka slipped from Indra's hand, he remained
<div n="lb">in the sky and did not drop down in the fire;
<div n="lb">on Śaunaka's query whether Takṣaka's not
<div n="lb">falling down from the mid-region was due to
<div n="lb">the fact that the (suitable) {%mantras%}
<div n="lb">did not reveal themselves to the priests
<div n="lb">({%mantragrāmo manīṣiṇām na pratyabhāt%}
<div n="lb">1. 53. 4), Sūta replied that that happened
<div n="lb">because Āstīka thrice said to the serpent
<div n="lb">‘stay’ ({%tiṣṭha%}) 1. 53. 1-6, and Takṣaka
