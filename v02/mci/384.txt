{@Supratīka<sup>1</sup>@}¦ m.: Name of Bhagadatta's
elephant.
{@A.@} Description: big ({%mahādvipa%} 6.
91. 41; 7. 25. 36; 7. 27. 29; 7. 28. 39); excel-
lent, chief or king of the elephants ({%gaja-%}
{%pravara%} 6. 91. 52; {%nāgapravara%} 7. 25. 20, 58;
{%vāraṇottama%} 6. 17. 36; {%dviparṣabha%} 7. 25. 35;
{%dviradaśreṣṭha%} 7. 26. 5; {%nāgendra%} 6. 91. 36;
{%gajapati%} 6. 91. 43; {%nāgarāja%} 6. 79. 25; 7.
25. 56); very swift ({%āśugati%} 7. 25. 39),
hence although one, appeared to enemies like
hundreds or hosts of elephants 7. 25. 39, 59;
never fatigued, the elephant always achieved
his objective in battles ({%saṃkhye kṛtakarmā%}
[Page070-b+ 40]
{%jitaklamaḥ%}) 7. 26. 5; indescribable, unrival-
led in battles ({%sadāpratigajo yudhi/sarva-%}
{%śabdātigaḥ%}) 7. 26. 5; white like silver
({%rajatopama%} 6. 112. 57); compared with
elephant of Indra ({%mahendragajasaṃnibha%}
6. 112. 55); at one place Supratīka actually
identified with the elephant of Indra ({%yena%}
{%nāgena maghavān ajayad daityadānavān/sa%}
{%nāgapravaro bhīmaṃ sahasā samupādravat%})
7. 25. 20; yet also said to be in appearance
(dark ?) like a cloud ({%jīmūtasaṃkāśān%}
{%nāgāt%} 7. 27. 24). {@B.@} Part in the epic
war: Ordered by Bhīsma, Bhagadatta with
his elephant in rut (not named) rushed against
Bhīma; Abhimanyu and other heroes pierced
the elephant with arrows; incited, the elephant
ran with double speed; the rutting elephant,
goaded by Bhagadatta, attacked with double
speed the Pāṇḍava warriors like the God of
Death; seeing his big form all the great
warriors on the side of the Pāṇḍavas became
uneasy 6. 60. 37-44; Ghaṭotkaca drove his
elephant against Bhagadatta in order to kill
him and his elephant; the other elephants
driven by the Rākṣasas also attacked Bhaga-
datta's elephant with tusks; afflicted by the
attack and pierced with arrows, Bhagadatta's
elephant roared loudly like a thunder; hearing
it Bhīṣma reported to Droṇa and Duryodhaṇa
that Bhagadatta must be in danger 6. 60. 53-
57; in another battle between Bhagadatta and
Ghaṭotkaca, the latter tried to kill the former's
elephant (Supratīka not named, referred to as
{%prāgjyotiṣagaja%}) with a {%śakti,%} but it was cut
into three pieces by Bhagadatta 6. 79. 37-38;
Bhagadatta, mounted on Supratīka, attacked
the Pāṇḍava heroes (6. 91. 23); Bhagadatta,
seated on Supratīka's head ({%supratīkaśiro-%}
{%gataḥ%} 6. 91. 33), ichor flowing from Supra-
tīka's temples in seven streams, attacked
[Page071-a+ 40]
Bhīma 6. 91. 31-33, 37; Pāṇḍava warriors
encircled Supratīka on all sides; Supratīka
attacked by the mountain-like elephant of the
king of the Daśārṇa country 6. 91. 40, 42;
Bhagadatta goaded his elephant Supratīka
with his hook and toe ({%aṅkuśāṅguṣṭhanuditaḥ%}
{%sa gajapravaro yudhi%} 6. 91. 52); running
hither and thither Supratīka crushed chariots,
horses together with their riders, and foot-
soldiers in hundreds and thousands; as a
result the Pāṇḍava army squeezed like a piece
of skin placed on fire; in order to kill Supra-
tīka Ghaṭotkaca hurled his {%śūla%} against
him, but Bhagadatta protected him by
cutting down the {%śūla%} 6. 91. 53-54, 57-58;
Bhagadatta, with his Supratīka crushing
the Pāṇḍava army, rushed towards Yudhi-
ṣṭhira 6. 91. 79; Arjuna with great effort
checked the advance of Supratīka and pierced
him with sharp arrows made of {%ayas%} 6.
112. 55, 57; in the fight of Bhagadatta with
Bhīma, the former's elephant (Supratīka
not named) appeared to kill Bhīma 7. 25.
19-24; Bhagadatta on his elephant fought the
army of the Pāṇḍavas and the Pāñcālas 7.
25. 24-27, and the army led by Yudhiṣṭhira
7. 25. 32-41; Bhagadatta's elephant took
hold of Sātyaki's chariot and hurled it away
7. 25. 36; in the encounter between Bhaga-
datta's elephant and the elephant of the king
of Daśārṇas the former proved victorious 7. 25.
28-30; in the encounter between Bhīma and
Bhagadatta, the latter's elephant frightened
Bhīma's horses by sprinkling water on them
7. 25. 43; he shattered the charioteer of
Yuyutsu by stepping on his horses 7. 25.
49; Bhagadatta charged his elephant against
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuṇa to kill them; seeing him
rush like the angry God of Death, Kṛṣṇa
avoided frontal attack by quickly driving
[Page071-b+ 40]
Arjuna's chariot around the elephant keeping
him on the right ({%cakre 'pasavyaṃ tvaritaḥ%}
{%syandanena janārdanaḥ%} 7. 27. 28); although
Supratīka was within his reach, Arjuna, rem-
embering the rule (of the war), did not kill
the elephant together with Bhagadatta from
behind ({%saṃprāptam api neyeṣa parāvṛttaṃ%}
{%mahādvipam/sārohaṃ mṛtyusātkartuṃ%}
{%smaran dharmaṃ dhanaṃjayaḥ%} 7. 27. 29);
Bhagadatta's elephant then sent many
elephants and horses to death and crushed
the chariots 7. 27. 27-30. {@C.@} Supratīka
not named: As in some of the above
accounts, at some other places also Bhaga-
datta is mentioned with his elephant without
naming the elephant; at all such places
obviously Supratīka is meant: 5. 164. 38;
6. 17. 36; 6. 60. 53, 59; 6. 79. 37, 41;
6. 91. 37; 6. 112. 54-57; 7. 25. 19; 7. 26.
3, 5; 7. 27. 21-24; 27-30; 7. 28. 3, 8.
{@D.@} Comparisons: (1) with mountain: (a)
Supratīka with ichor issuing out at seven
places compared with a mountain with water
flowing down on all sides 6. 91. 32; (b)
pierced by arrows and blood issuing from his
body, Supratīka looked like Himavant
coloured with red minerals ({%dhātucitra%}
{%ivādrirāṭ%}) 6. 91. 41; (c) fight between
Supratīka and the elephant of the king
of Daśārṇas compared with that of two
winged mountains 7. 25. 29; (d) Bhaga-
datta's elephant frightened the enemies as
formerly the chief winged mountain frightened
(its enemies ?) 7. 25. 56; (e) Bhagadatta's
elephant devoid of his armour looked like the
king of the mountains bereft of clouds 7. 28. 8;
(2) with other elephants: (a) Supratīka
with Bhagadatta seated on him and shooting
arrows compared with Airāvata with Indra
seated on him and sending down streams of
[Page072-a+ 40]
water 6. 91 33, (5. 16. 38); (b) Bhaga-
datta on elephant destroying Pāṇḍava army
compared with Indra on his Airāvata destroy-
ing the Dānavas 7. 25. 40; (c) Bhagadatta's
elephant crushed the Pāṇḍava army as a
wild elephant crushes a host of lotuses 6. 79.
41; (3) with cloud: Bhagadatta's elephant
pierced by arrows looked like a big cloud
penetrated by sun's rays 7. 25. 52; (4) with
ocean: Bhagadatta's elephant frightened the
enemies as ocean frightens the merchants 7. 25.
56; (5) with shore of the ocean: Supratīka
checked the onslaught of the elephant of the
Daśārṇa king as the shore checks the advance
of the ocean 6. 91. 43; (6) with arrow:
Supratīka, discharged against Bhīma, sped
like an arrow discharged from the bow-string
6. 91. 37; (7) with fire: Supratīka goaded
by Bhagadatta looked like the Saṃvartaka
fire 6. 91. 52. {@E.@} End: Bhagadatta, with
his elephant Supratīka, was killed ({%śasta%})
by Arjuna 1. 2. 161; in the final encounter of
Bhagadatta with Arjuna, the latter cut down
the armour of Bhagadatta's elephant (Su-
pratīka not named) 7. 28. 8; he struck the
elephant between the temples with the {%nārāca%}
arrow; the arrow went deep upto its feathered
part; with the limbs stiffened and the tusks
piercing the ground, the elephant fell down;
he died roaring aloud 7. 28. 37, 39.
