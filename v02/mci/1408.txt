{@Puṣkara<sup>1</sup>@}¦ nt., sg. and pl. ({@Puṣkarāṇi,@}
{@Puṣkareṣu@}): Name of a {%tīrtha;%} also called
once {@Pitāmahasaras@} (3. 87. 13).
{@A.@} Location: In the west 3. 87. 1.
{@B.@} Description: Holy ({%puṇya%}) 3. 87. 13;
({%puṇyam antarikṣe ca puṣkaram%}) 3. 81. 173;
the lake of Pitāmaha Brahmadeva ({%pitāmaha-%}
{%saras%}) 3. 87. 13; of the high-souled (Pitā-
maha ?) ({%tīrthe mahātmanaḥ%}) 3. 80. 51;
the {%tīrtha%} of the god of gods (Brahmadeva)
({%devadevasya tīrtham%}) 3. 80. 41; famous,
famous in the three worlds ({%vikhyāta, trai-%}
{%lokyaviśruta%}) 3. 80. 41. {@C.@} Epic events:
(1) Arjuna, after his marriage with Subhadrā,
spent with her at the Puṣkaras ({%puṣkareṣu%})
the remaining period of his exile 1. 213. 13;
(2) Lomaśa advised Yudhiṣṭhira to bathe
({%jalaṃ spṛśa%}) in all the Puṣkaras ({%puṣka-%}
{%reṣu … sarveṣu%}) 3. 125. 12; (3) Pulastya
recommended it to Bhīṣma 3. 80. 41. {@D.@}
Past events: (1) Arjuna, while recounting
the past austerities performed by Kṛṣṇa,
said that formerly he once lived at the
Puṣkaras ({%puṣkareṣu%}) for ten thousand and
ten hundred years living only on water 3.
13. 1; (2) When the Pitāmaha was once
engaged in a sacrifice at the Puṣkara
({%puṣkarasthe pitāmahe%}), the sages said that
[Page384-a+ 40]
the sacrifice will not yield great fruit ({%nāyaṃ%}
{%yajño mahāphalaḥ%}) as the Sarasvatī was
not to be seen there; hearing that, the
Pitāmaha thought of the river and invited
her to appear at the Puṣkaras ({%puṣkareṣu%})
which she did as the river Suprabhā; thus the
Sarasvatī became manifest at the Puṣkaras
({%puṣkareṣu%}) for the sake of the Pitāmaha
and for the satisfaction of the wise 9. 37. 11,
12, 14. {@E.@} Holiness: (1) There are
{%āśramas%} of the Vaikhānasas, the Siddhas,
and the sages at the Puṣkara 3. 87. 13; one
should settle down there ({%samāviśet%}) 3. 80.
41; gods and sages achieved there ({%puṣka-%}
{%reṣu%}) great perfection and were endowed with
great merit ({%siddhiṃ samabhisaṃprāptāḥ%}
{%puṇyena mahatānvitāḥ%}) 3. 80. 47; (2)
Prajāpati sang a {%gāthā%} at the Puṣkaras
({%puṣkareṣu%}) in praise of the Puṣkaras: If
a spirited person ({%manasvin%}) even mentally
longs for the Puṣkaras ({%puṣkarāṇi%}) his sins
are destroyed and he is delighted in heaven
({%nākapṛṣṭhe ca modate%}) 3. 87. 14-15; (3)
The wise say that one who is engaged in the
worship of the manes and gods ({%pitṛdevā-%}
{%rcane rataḥ%}) and who takes bath ({%abhi-%}
{%ṣeka%}) in this {%tīrtha%} gets the fruit of a horse
sacrifice ten times ({%aśvamedhaṃ daśaguṇaṃ%}
{%pravadanti manīṣiṇaḥ%}); if a person of any
one of the four classes bathes there these
high-souled persons are then not born in a
lower species ({%na viyoniṃ vrajanty ete snātās%}
{%tīrthe mahātmanaḥ%}); if one visits the Puṣkara
especially on the full moon day of the month
of Kārtika his fruit increases without ever
being destroyed ({%phalaṃ tatrākṣayaṃ tasya%}
{%vardhate%}) 3. 80. 48, 51-52; stay at the
Puṣkara on the full moon night of the
Kārtika ({%kārtikīṃ vā vased ekām%}) is equal
to performing an Agnihotra for a full hundred
[Page384-b+ 40]
years ({%varṣaśataṃ pūrṇaṃ agnihotram%})
3. 80. 57; (4) One who remembers the
Puṣkara morning and evening with folded
hands will have bathed in all the {%tīrthas%} and
will get imperishable worlds in the abode of
Brahman ({%upaspṛṣṭaṃ bhavet tena sarvatī-%}
{%rtheṣu bhārata prāpnuyāc ca naro lokān%}
{%brahmaṇaḥ sadane 'kṣayān%}) 3. 80. 53
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 82. 33: {%upaspṛṣṭaṃ%}
{%snātaṃ bhavet%}); whatever sin is com-
mitted by a man or a woman it gets
destroyed as soon as one bathes in the
Puṣkara ({%puṣkare snātamātrasya%}) 3. 80.
54; if a wise person even mentally longs
for the Puṣkaras ({%manasāpy abhikāmasya%}
{%puṣkarāṇi manasvinaḥ%}) all his sins are
cleansed and he is worshipped in heaven
({%nākapṛṣṭhe ca pūjyate%}) 3. 80. 45; (5)
At the Puṣkara ten thousand crores of {%tīrthas%}
are present at all the three divisions of the
day ({%sāṃnidhyaṃ puṣkare yeṣāṃ trisan-%}
{%dhyam%}) 3. 83. 42; (6) At this {%tīrtha%} the
Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Sādhyas,
the Maruts, the Gandharvas, and the Apsa-
rases are present at all times; Pitāmaha lived
there happily for ever 3. 80. 43, 46; (7)
The gods, the Daityas, and the Brahmani-
cal sages practised austerities and, by the
great religious merit thus acquired, they at-
tained divine {%yoga (divyayogāḥ),%} i. e., they
attained perfection ({%siddhiṃ samabhisaṃ-%}
{%prāptāḥ%}) 3. 80. 44, 47; (8) By living at
the Puṣkara for twelve years a person who
is controlled and pure ({%niyataḥ śuciḥ%})
obtains the fruit of all sacrifices and goes to
the world of Brahman 3. 80. 56; (9)
Puṣkara is one of those place by visiting
which one becomes auspicious, has a divine
form, puts on heavenly garlands and being
rich in heavenly fragrance delights in the
[Page385-a+ 40]
world of the cows ({%? modanti gavāṃ%}
{%vimāne%}) 13. 105. 44, 48 (for citation see
{@Karatoyinī@}); (10) Aṅgiras told Gautama
that by bathing ({%vigāhya%}) in the Puṣkara
one rides in the Vimāna ({%vimānasthaḥ%})
and is awakened by the praises of the
Apsarases 13. 26. 9; (11) Śaunaka advised
Janamejaya to visit the Puṣkara; such
visit gave the person longevity again in this
life ({%labdhāyur jīvite punaḥ%}) 12. 148. 11;
(12) Parāśara told Janaka that more than
bathing in the water of Puṣkara one should
practise (lit. bathe in) austerities at the
Puṣkaras ({%puṣkareṣu%}) and other holy places
({%adbhyo bhūyaḥ plāvyaṃ tapasā vai%}
{%śarīram%}) 12. 286. 37; (13) Puṣkara
considered as the holy place of the mid-region
({%pṛthivyāṃ naimiṣam puṇyam antarikṣe ca%}
{%puṣkaram%}) 3. 81. 173; (however, Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 83. 202: {%antarikṣe sūrya-%}
{%candrādimārge nakṣatrādicakre puṣkaraṃ%}
{%prāpayatīty arthaḥ%}); (also see the section
{@G.@} Importance and {@H.@} Simile below and
section {@C.@} Epic events (2) and (3) above);
{@F.@} Limitations: (i) Giving gifts of horses
in very large numbers and of thousands of
cows to the Brāhmaṇas at the Puṣkara
({%puṣkareṣu%}) was highly meritorious no
doubt; ({%daśāyutāni cāśvānām ayutāni ca%}
{%viṃśatim/puṣkareṣu dvijātibhyaḥ prādāṃ%}
{%gāś ca sahasraśaḥ%}); but that was not
enough to enable one to reach the Brahma-
loka—this is what Bhagīratha told Brahman
13. 106. 11; (ii) Sprinkling one's body with
the water of the Puṣkara is not necessary for
one who listens to the Bhārata ({%yo bhārataṃ%}
{%samadhigacchati vācyamānaṃ kiṃ tasya%}
{%puṣkarajalair abhiṣecanena%}) 1. 2. 242 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 1. 2. 392: {%puṣakaraṃ ādi-%}
{%tīrthaṃ śuṇḍāgraṃ vā tadupāhṛtajalaiḥ%});
[Page385-b+ 39]
{@G.@} Importance: (1) Puṣkara is the first
among the {%tīrthas%} as Madhusūdana is among
all gods ({%yathā surāṇām sarveṣām ādis tu%}
{%madhusūdanaḥ/tathaiva puṣkaraṃ rājaṃs%}
{%tīrthānām ādir ucyate%}) 3. 80. 55; (2) It
is not easy to go to the Puṣkara, not easy
to perform austerities there or to give gifts
there; to be able to live there is extremely
difficult ({%duṣkaraṃ puṣkaraṃ gantuṃ duṣ-%}
{%karaṃ puṣkare tapaḥ/duṣkaraṃ puṣkare%}
{%dānaṃ vastuṃ caiva suduṣkaram//%}) 3. 80.
58; (3) Finds mention in the Daivata-
Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa 13. 151. 14, 2. {@H.@} Simile:
The entrance of the Kurukṣetra is as holy as
the Puṣkaras ({%kurukṣetrasya tad dvāram%}
{% … saṃmite puṣkarāṇāṃ ca%}) 3. 81. 20-21.
