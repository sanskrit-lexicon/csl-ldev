<div n="lb">ing loud sound ({%sughoṣa%}) 8. 68. 55; ({%mahā-%}
<div n="lb">{%svana%}) 8. 68. 56. {@D.@} Sound: Its sound
<div n="lb">({%nāda, nirghoṣa, rava, ninada%}) was frightful
<div n="lb">({%bhairava%}) 7. 56. 36; ({%ghora%}) 7. 102. 57,
<div n="lb">58; the sound ({%nirghoṣa%}) was produced only
<div n="lb">on the {%ṛṣabha%} note ({%ārṣabheṇaiva pūri-%}
<div n="lb">{%tam%}) 7. 56. 36 [Nī. {%ārṣabheṇa ṛṣbhasvara-%}
<div n="lb">{%prakāreṇa%} on 7. 79. 39 Bom. Ed.]; Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">filled it fully with breath while blowing it (3.
<div n="lb">21. 30) and the sound caused the whole world,
<div n="lb">including the {%pātāla,%} the heaven, and the guar-
<div n="lb">dians of the quarters, to tremble 7. 51. 42;
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa blew it forcefully to produce a shrill
<div n="lb">note ({%pāñcajanyaṃ ca balavad dadhmau%}
<div n="lb">{%tāreṇa keśavaḥ%}) 7. 78. 37; the sound excelled
<div n="lb">all other sounds and filled the heaven and
<div n="lb">the earth 7. 79. 13; 7. 102. 59; 8. 37. 19; 8.
<div n="lb">68. 57; it reverberated in forests, mountains,
<div n="lb">rivers and directions 8. 68. 57; 6. 55. 102; it
<div n="lb">produced sound like the one heard at the flash
<div n="lb">of a lightning 5. 149. 65. {@E.@} Effect of the
<div n="lb">sound: The sound caused delight to warriors
<div n="lb">on Kṛṣṇa's side 5. 149. 65; 6. 1. 17; but the
<div n="lb">enemies felt dejected (5. 47. 59; 8. 37. 20),
<div n="lb">and trembled; they lost courage, and the
<div n="lb">draught-animals passed urine and dung 7.
<div n="lb">64. 21-24; 6. 1. 18; 6. 67. 2; 7. 3. 19; 8.
<div n="lb">68. 55; 9. 3. 19; hearing it enemies, strong
<div n="lb">and weak, fell on the ground 7. 78. 38.
<div n="lb">{@F.@} Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) when
<div n="lb">the Pāṇḍava warriors reached Kurukṣetra
<div n="lb">they blew their respective conches and so did
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna 5. 149. 64-65; (ii) when
<div n="lb">the two armies were arrayed against each
<div n="lb">other, ready to fight, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna blew
<div n="lb">their conches 6. 1. 17; 6. 23. 15; (iii) Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">blew his Pāñcajanya at the start of the
<div n="lb">second day's war 6. 47. 25 (and presumably
[Page113-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">at the start of the war on all subsequent
<div n="lb">days); (iv) when Arjuna vowed to fight
<div n="lb">more seriously with Bhīṣma 6. 55. 102;
<div n="lb">(v) when Arjuna rushed at Bhīṣma who was
<div n="lb">fighting with other Pāṇḍavas 6. 67. 2;
<div n="lb">(vi) Kṛṣṇa blew his conch when Arjuna
<div n="lb">took the vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 51. 41;
<div n="lb">(vii) at the start of the day on which Jaya-
<div n="lb">dratha was killed 7. 64. 20; when Arjuna was
<div n="lb">heading forward looking for Jayadratha in
<div n="lb">the Kaurava army 7. 75. 31; as Arjuna was
<div n="lb">nearing Jayadratha 7. 78. 37; 7. 79. 11; at
<div n="lb">the end of the day when Jayadratha was killed
<div n="lb">7. 123. 41; [It is significant that the sounding
<div n="lb">of Pāñcajanya is mentioned on many occa-
<div n="lb">sions on the day on which Arjuna had to
<div n="lb">fulfil his difficult vow to kill Jayadratha];
<div n="lb">(viii) Kṛṣṇa blew it when Arjuna got rid
<div n="lb">of the Saṃśaptakas who had overwhelmed
<div n="lb">both of them 8. 37. 19, 15-17; (ix) at the
<div n="lb">death of Karṇa and the subsequent rout of
<div n="lb">the Kaurava army 8. 68. 57; (x) at the fall
<div n="lb">of Duryodhana 9. 60. 65; (2) Outside the
<div n="lb">epic war: Kṛṣṇa blew it to challenge Śālva
<div n="lb">when he reached Śālva's Saubhapura 3. 15.
<div n="lb">20; when Kṛṣṇa started fighting with Śālva
<div n="lb">3. 21. 12; when, during his fight with Śālva,
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa killed many Dānavas 3. 21. 29-30;
<div n="lb">{@G.@} Its use as a signal: (1) Kṛṣṇa had told
<div n="lb">Dāruka, his charioteer, that when he heard
<div n="lb">the sound of Pāñcajanya he was to rush to
<div n="lb">the battle-field driving Kṛṣṇa's chariot for its
<div n="lb">eventual use by Kṛṣṇa to enable Arjuna to
<div n="lb">fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 56. 36;
<div n="lb">(2) The sound was once interpreted by
<div n="lb">Droṇa to mean that Arjuna wanted to set
<div n="lb">aside other heroes and attack Bhīṣma 6. 108.
<div n="lb">14; (3) It was once interpreted by
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira to mean that Arjuna was in
<div n="lb">danger 7. 85. 35; on another occasion, the
[Page113-b+ 37]
<div n="lb">sound meant for Yudhiṣṭhira the death of
<div n="lb">Arjuna, and hence Kṛṣṇa's starting to fight
<div n="lb">7. 102. 32-33. {@H.@} End: When the time
<div n="lb">of the destruction of the Vṛṣṇis and the
<div n="lb">Andhakas arrived the blowing of Pāñca-
<div n="lb">janya in their houses was accompanied by
<div n="lb">the harsh braying of the asses 16. 3. 15
<div n="lb">[{%nadantaṃ pāñcajanyaṃ ca vṛṣṇyandhaka-%}
<div n="lb">{%niveśane/samantāt pratyavāśyanta rāsabhā%}
<div n="lb">{%dāruṇasvarāḥ//%} Does Pāñcajanya here refer
<div n="lb">not to Kṛṣṇa's special conch, but to the conches
<div n="lb">in general in the houses of the Vṛṣṇis and
<div n="lb">the Andhakas ?].
