[Page112-b+ 40]
{%pariṣkṛta%}) 6. 47. 24, and covered with golden
net ({%suvarṇajālāvatata%}) 8. 68. 56; produc-
ing loud sound ({%sughoṣa%}) 8. 68. 55; ({%mahā-%}
{%svana%}) 8. 68. 56. {@D.@} Sound: Its sound
({%nāda, nirghoṣa, rava, ninada%}) was frightful
({%bhairava%}) 7. 56. 36; ({%ghora%}) 7. 102. 57,
58; the sound ({%nirghoṣa%}) was produced only
on the {%ṛṣabha%} note ({%ārṣabheṇaiva pūri-%}
{%tam%}) 7. 56. 36 [Nī. {%ārṣabheṇa ṛṣbhasvara-%}
{%prakāreṇa%} on 7. 79. 39 Bom. Ed.]; Kṛṣṇa
filled it fully with breath while blowing it (3.
21. 30) and the sound caused the whole world,
including the {%pātāla,%} the heaven, and the guar-
dians of the quarters, to tremble 7. 51. 42;
Kṛṣṇa blew it forcefully to produce a shrill
note ({%pāñcajanyaṃ ca balavad dadhmau%}
{%tāreṇa keśavaḥ%}) 7. 78. 37; the sound excelled
all other sounds and filled the heaven and
the earth 7. 79. 13; 7. 102. 59; 8. 37. 19; 8.
68. 57; it reverberated in forests, mountains,
rivers and directions 8. 68. 57; 6. 55. 102; it
produced sound like the one heard at the flash
of a lightning 5. 149. 65. {@E.@} Effect of the
sound: The sound caused delight to warriors
on Kṛṣṇa's side 5. 149. 65; 6. 1. 17; but the
enemies felt dejected (5. 47. 59; 8. 37. 20),
and trembled; they lost courage, and the
draught-animals passed urine and dung 7.
64. 21-24; 6. 1. 18; 6. 67. 2; 7. 3. 19; 8.
68. 55; 9. 3. 19; hearing it enemies, strong
and weak, fell on the ground 7. 78. 38.
{@F.@} Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) when
the Pāṇḍava warriors reached Kurukṣetra
they blew their respective conches and so did
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna 5. 149. 64-65; (ii) when
the two armies were arrayed against each
other, ready to fight, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna blew
their conches 6. 1. 17; 6. 23. 15; (iii) Kṛṣṇa
blew his Pāñcajanya at the start of the
second day's war 6. 47. 25 (and presumably
[Page113-a+ 40]
at the start of the war on all subsequent
days); (iv) when Arjuna vowed to fight
more seriously with Bhīṣma 6. 55. 102;
(v) when Arjuna rushed at Bhīṣma who was
fighting with other Pāṇḍavas 6. 67. 2;
(vi) Kṛṣṇa blew his conch when Arjuna
took the vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 51. 41;
(vii) at the start of the day on which Jaya-
dratha was killed 7. 64. 20; when Arjuna was
heading forward looking for Jayadratha in
the Kaurava army 7. 75. 31; as Arjuna was
nearing Jayadratha 7. 78. 37; 7. 79. 11; at
the end of the day when Jayadratha was killed
7. 123. 41; [It is significant that the sounding
of Pāñcajanya is mentioned on many occa-
sions on the day on which Arjuna had to
fulfil his difficult vow to kill Jayadratha];
(viii) Kṛṣṇa blew it when Arjuna got rid
of the Saṃśaptakas who had overwhelmed
both of them 8. 37. 19, 15-17; (ix) at the
death of Karṇa and the subsequent rout of
the Kaurava army 8. 68. 57; (x) at the fall
of Duryodhana 9. 60. 65; (2) Outside the
epic war: Kṛṣṇa blew it to challenge Śālva
when he reached Śālva's Saubhapura 3. 15.
20; when Kṛṣṇa started fighting with Śālva
3. 21. 12; when, during his fight with Śālva,
Kṛṣṇa killed many Dānavas 3. 21. 29-30;
{@G.@} Its use as a signal: (1) Kṛṣṇa had told
Dāruka, his charioteer, that when he heard
the sound of Pāñcajanya he was to rush to
the battle-field driving Kṛṣṇa's chariot for its
eventual use by Kṛṣṇa to enable Arjuna to
fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 56. 36;
(2) The sound was once interpreted by
Droṇa to mean that Arjuna wanted to set
aside other heroes and attack Bhīṣma 6. 108.
14; (3) It was once interpreted by
Yudhiṣṭhira to mean that Arjuna was in
danger 7. 85. 35; on another occasion, the
[Page113-b+ 37]
sound meant for Yudhiṣṭhira the death of
Arjuna, and hence Kṛṣṇa's starting to fight
7. 102. 32-33. {@H.@} End: When the time
of the destruction of the Vṛṣṇis and the
Andhakas arrived the blowing of Pāñca-
janya in their houses was accompanied by
the harsh braying of the asses 16. 3. 15
[{%nadantaṃ pāñcajanyaṃ ca vṛṣṇyandhaka-%}
{%niveśane/samantāt pratyavāśyanta rāsabhā%}
{%dāruṇasvarāḥ//%} Does Pāñcajanya here refer
not to Kṛṣṇa's special conch, but to the conches
in general in the houses of the Vṛṣṇis and
the Andhakas ?].
