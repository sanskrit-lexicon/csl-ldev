{@Mātaṅgavacana@}¦ nt.: A stanza attribu-
ted to Mātaṅga 5. 125. 19-20.
<div n="P">Duryodhana, when under pressure from
all quarters to come to terms with the
Pāṇḍavas, while replying to Kṛṣṇa quoted
the authority of Mātaṅga in support of the
course of action chosen by him (viz. not
bowing down before the enemy for fear of
losing life); Mātaṅga had said: “One should
rise up and not bow down, for rising up
means manliness; one may break one's bone
(lit. ‘which has no joints’), but not bow
down before any one” ({%udyacched eva%}
{%na named udyamo hy eva pauruṣam/apy%}
{%aparvaṇt bhajyeta na named iha kasyacit/%})
5. 125. 19 (However Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5.
127. 19: {%aparvaṇi aprastāve%}); this dictum
of Mātaṅga is cherished by those who seek
their welfare ({%iti mātaṅgavacanaṃ parī-%}
{%psantī hitepsavaḥ%}) 5. 125. 20.
