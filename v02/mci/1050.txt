<div n="lb">Great ({%mahat%}) 9. 35. 24; very deep ({%agādha%})
<div n="lb">and extremely terrible ({%sumahāghora%}) 3. 35.
<div n="lb">25; without water ({%nirjala%}), hence covered
<div n="lb">with soil ({%pāṃsusṃvṛta, pāṃsugrasta%}) 9.
<div n="lb">35. 28, 32; covered with plants and grass
<div n="lb">({%vīruttṛṇāvṛta%}) 9. 35. 29; frightful to all
<div n="lb">creatures ({%sarvabhūtabhayaṅkara, prati-%}
<div n="lb">{%bhaya%}) 9. 35. 25, 42. {@C.@} Events: (1)
<div n="lb">Epic: Balarāma bathed there and gave ample
<div n="lb">wealth to Brāhmaṇas and worshipped them 9.
<div n="lb">35. 2, 52; he praised the {%tīrtha%} and left for
<div n="lb">Vinaśanatīrtha 9. 35. 53; (2) Of the past
<div n="lb">Yuga (9. 35. 7): Trita, afraid of a wolf,
<div n="lb">fell into this well; his two brothers, Ekata
<div n="lb">and Dvita (9. 35. 7), deserted him there
<div n="lb">and went home (9. 35. 25, 27, 4-6); he, by
<div n="lb">chance, saw a plant in the well (9. 35. 31);
<div n="lb">using it as a Soma plant, Trita offered a
<div n="lb">sacrifice in the well and drank Soma (9. 35.
<div n="lb">32-35, 3); gods came to the well, where Trita
<div n="lb">was consecrated for the sacrifice, to receive
<div n="lb">their shares (9. 35. 40); Trita asked the
<div n="lb">following boon from the gods: One who
<div n="lb">bathes in this well shall obtain the same
<div n="lb">condition after death as one who has (offered
<div n="lb">a Soma sacrifice and) drunk Soma ({%yaś%}
<div n="lb">{%cehopaspṛśet kūpe sa somapagatiṃ labhet%})
<div n="lb">9. 35. 45; at that moment Sarasvatī sprang up
<div n="lb">in the well and brought Trita out of the well
<div n="lb">9. 35. 46. {@D.@} Simile: Trita's falling
<div n="lb">down in the well compared to a sinner's
<div n="lb">falling in the Naraka 9. 35. 29.
