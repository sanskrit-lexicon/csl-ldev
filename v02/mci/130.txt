{@Jaratkāru@}¦ f.: A female serpent ({%bhu-%}
<div n="lb">{%jaṅgamā%}) 1. 43. 18, 22, 27, 28; 1. 44. 12;
<div n="lb">1. 49. 1; ({%bhujagottamā%}) 1. 48. 25.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Family: Younger sister ({%anujā%}
<div n="lb">{%svasā%}) of Vāsuki 1. 13. 34. {@B.@} Marriage:
<div n="lb">She was to be given in marriage to sage Jarat-
<div n="lb">kāru as alms ({%bhaikṣavat%}) when he came
<div n="lb">begging (for a girl of his name); this was
<div n="lb">originally the suggestion made by Brahmā to
<div n="lb">gods for saving serpents and it was reported
<div n="lb">to Vāsuki by Elāpatra 1. 34. 9-18; 1. 49. 13;
<div n="lb">this was told again by Brahmā to Vāsuki
<div n="lb">1. 35. 8-11; so Vāsuki kept Jaratkāru
<div n="lb">without marrying her to any one 1. 13. 34;
<div n="lb">1. 35. 2; when sage Jaratkāru announced his
<div n="lb">decision to marry a girl of his name, Vāsuki
<div n="lb">was informed of it by his serpent attendants;
<div n="lb">Vāsuki adorned his sister, told the sage that
<div n="lb">she had the same name as his, and assured
<div n="lb">him to maintain her even after marriage;
<div n="lb">sage Jaratkāru agreed to marry her; she was
[Page023-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">given as alms ({%bhaikṣavat%}) and with due
<div n="lb">rites 1. 42. 14-20; 1. 43. 1-4; 1. 13. 30-34,
<div n="lb">36-37. {@C.@} Dutiful wife: The sage lived
<div n="lb">with his wife at the residence of Vāsuki; she
<div n="lb">agreed to her husband's condition ({%samaya%})
<div n="lb">not to do anything that would displease
<div n="lb">him and that if she did he would leave her;
<div n="lb">1. 43. 7-9; once when she had bathed after
<div n="lb">her period she lay with her husband and
<div n="lb">conceived a child 1. 43. 11-12; after a few
<div n="lb">days when the sage had slept with his head
<div n="lb">on Jaratkāru's lap the sun was about to set;
<div n="lb">Jaratkāru awakened her husband for the
<div n="lb">evening rites; the angered sage got ready to
<div n="lb">leave her as his wife had displeased him; she
<div n="lb">told him that she woke him up not out of dis-
<div n="lb">regard but to save him from violating {%dharma.%}
<div n="lb">{@D.@} Concern for kinsmen: She pleaded with
<div n="lb">the sage not to leave her until she bore him a
<div n="lb">son as she was anxious for the welfare of her
<div n="lb">kinsmen; the child she had already conceived
<div n="lb">might not be a son ({%avyaktarūpaṃ garbham%}
<div n="lb">1. 43. 36); the sage thereupon assured his
<div n="lb">wife that she would give birth to a fire-like,
<div n="lb">learned son 1. 43. 13-39; Jaratkāru informed
<div n="lb">her brother Vāsuki about the sudden departure
<div n="lb">of her husband; Vāsuki was scared but Jarat-
<div n="lb">kāru told him about the assurance her husband
<div n="lb">gave her and that he had never told a lie be-
<div n="lb">fore 1. 44. 1-13. {@E.@} Birth of Āstīka: Vāsuki
<div n="lb">honoured his pregnant sister in all ways,
<div n="lb">and at proper time Jaratkāru gave birth to a
<div n="lb">child of divine lustre ({%devagarbhābha%}) 1. 44.
<div n="lb">15-17; he was named Āstīka 1. 44. 20; 1. 13.
<div n="lb">37. {@F.@} Snake sacrifice: Vāsuki, terrified
<div n="lb">at the destruction of snakes in the snake
<div n="lb">sacrifice of Janamejaya, went to Jaratkāru
<div n="lb">and reminded her of the purpose for which
<div n="lb">she was married to sage Jaratkāru; he asked
<div n="lb">her to tell her son Āstīka to intervene and
[Page024-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">stop the snake sacrifice 1. 48. 20-26; Jarat-
<div n="lb">kāru informed Āstīka why she was married
<div n="lb">to his father and asked him to stop the
<div n="lb">sacrifice 1. 49. 1-16; Āstīka assured Jarat-
<div n="lb">kāru that he would fulfil the purpose of his
<div n="lb">birth 1. 49. 17; on completing his mission
<div n="lb">Āstīka informed his mother (and Vāsuki)
<div n="lb">what had happened at the snake sacrifice 1.
<div n="lb">53. 17. {@G.@} Reward: Since Jaratkāru
<div n="lb">saved the life of snakes her name appeared
<div n="lb">in the {%mantra%} to be recited for obtaining
<div n="lb">protection from serpents 1. 53. 22.
