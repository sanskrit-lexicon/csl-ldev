{@Jaratkāru@}¦ f.: A female serpent ({%bhu-%}
{%jaṅgamā%}) 1. 43. 18, 22, 27, 28; 1. 44. 12;
1. 49. 1; ({%bhujagottamā%}) 1. 48. 25.
{@A.@} Family: Younger sister ({%anujā%}
{%svasā%}) of Vāsuki 1. 13. 34. {@B.@} Marriage:
She was to be given in marriage to sage Jarat-
kāru as alms ({%bhaikṣavat%}) when he came
begging (for a girl of his name); this was
originally the suggestion made by Brahmā to
gods for saving serpents and it was reported
to Vāsuki by Elāpatra 1. 34. 9-18; 1. 49. 13;
this was told again by Brahmā to Vāsuki
1. 35. 8-11; so Vāsuki kept Jaratkāru
without marrying her to any one 1. 13. 34;
1. 35. 2; when sage Jaratkāru announced his
decision to marry a girl of his name, Vāsuki
was informed of it by his serpent attendants;
Vāsuki adorned his sister, told the sage that
she had the same name as his, and assured
him to maintain her even after marriage;
sage Jaratkāru agreed to marry her; she was
[Page023-b+ 40]
given as alms ({%bhaikṣavat%}) and with due
rites 1. 42. 14-20; 1. 43. 1-4; 1. 13. 30-34,
36-37. {@C.@} Dutiful wife: The sage lived
with his wife at the residence of Vāsuki; she
agreed to her husband's condition ({%samaya%})
not to do anything that would displease
him and that if she did he would leave her;
1. 43. 7-9; once when she had bathed after
her period she lay with her husband and
conceived a child 1. 43. 11-12; after a few
days when the sage had slept with his head
on Jaratkāru's lap the sun was about to set;
Jaratkāru awakened her husband for the
evening rites; the angered sage got ready to
leave her as his wife had displeased him; she
told him that she woke him up not out of dis-
regard but to save him from violating {%dharma.%}
{@D.@} Concern for kinsmen: She pleaded with
the sage not to leave her until she bore him a
son as she was anxious for the welfare of her
kinsmen; the child she had already conceived
might not be a son ({%avyaktarūpaṃ garbham%}
1. 43. 36); the sage thereupon assured his
wife that she would give birth to a fire-like,
learned son 1. 43. 13-39; Jaratkāru informed
her brother Vāsuki about the sudden departure
of her husband; Vāsuki was scared but Jarat-
kāru told him about the assurance her husband
gave her and that he had never told a lie be-
fore 1. 44. 1-13. {@E.@} Birth of Āstīka: Vāsuki
honoured his pregnant sister in all ways,
and at proper time Jaratkāru gave birth to a
child of divine lustre ({%devagarbhābha%}) 1. 44.
15-17; he was named Āstīka 1. 44. 20; 1. 13.
37. {@F.@} Snake sacrifice: Vāsuki, terrified
at the destruction of snakes in the snake
sacrifice of Janamejaya, went to Jaratkāru
and reminded her of the purpose for which
she was married to sage Jaratkāru; he asked
her to tell her son Āstīka to intervene and
[Page024-a+ 40]
stop the snake sacrifice 1. 48. 20-26; Jarat-
kāru informed Āstīka why she was married
to his father and asked him to stop the
sacrifice 1. 49. 1-16; Āstīka assured Jarat-
kāru that he would fulfil the purpose of his
birth 1. 49. 17; on completing his mission
Āstīka informed his mother (and Vāsuki)
what had happened at the snake sacrifice 1.
53. 17. {@G.@} Reward: Since Jaratkāru
saved the life of snakes her name appeared
in the {%mantra%} to be recited for obtaining
protection from serpents 1. 53. 22.
