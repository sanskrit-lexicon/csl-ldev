{@Śūra@}¦ m. (pl): Name of a people.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Location: Śūras lived probably in
<div n="lb">the north-west and were different from the
<div n="lb">Śūrasenas since they are mentioned along
<div n="lb">with Daradas, Bāhlīkas and others and since
<div n="lb">they are said to have brought tribute for the
<div n="lb">Rājasūya (see Epic event No. 1 below)
<div n="lb">and also because they are grouped with
<div n="lb">Yavanas (see {@B@} below). {@B.@} Special
<div n="lb">characteristic: According to a certain
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa reporting to Dhṛtarāṣṭra in the
<div n="lb">assembly of Kurus (8. 30. 7, 58), Śūras,
<div n="lb">like Yavanas, had the special characteristic
<div n="lb">of being clever in knowing everything
<div n="lb">(even though what was to be conveyed
<div n="lb">was not expressed in so many words)
<div n="lb">({%sarvajñā yavanā rājañ śūrāś caiva viśe-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣataḥ%}) 8. 30. 80. {@C.@} Epic event: The
<div n="lb">Kṣatriyas among the Śūras, along with
<div n="lb">Vāyavyas and others, brought wealth in
<div n="lb">hundreds as tribute for the Rājasūya of
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira ({%āhārṣuḥ kṣatriyā vittaṃ śataśo%}
<div n="lb">{%'jātaśatrave%}) 2. 48. 12, 16; (Vṛṣṇis and
<div n="lb">Andhakas, however, who like Śūrasenas,
<div n="lb">are sections of Yādavas, are reported to
<div n="lb">have not given tribute for the Rājasūya
<div n="lb">2. 48. 42).
