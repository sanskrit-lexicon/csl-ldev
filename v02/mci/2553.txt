{@Śūra@}¦ m. (pl): Name of a people.
{@A.@} Location: Śūras lived probably in
the north-west and were different from the
Śūrasenas since they are mentioned along
with Daradas, Bāhlīkas and others and since
they are said to have brought tribute for the
Rājasūya (see Epic event No. 1 below)
and also because they are grouped with
Yavanas (see {@B@} below). {@B.@} Special
characteristic: According to a certain
Brāhmaṇa reporting to Dhṛtarāṣṭra in the
assembly of Kurus (8. 30. 7, 58), Śūras,
like Yavanas, had the special characteristic
of being clever in knowing everything
(even though what was to be conveyed
was not expressed in so many words)
({%sarvajñā yavanā rājañ śūrāś caiva viśe-%}
{%ṣataḥ%}) 8. 30. 80. {@C.@} Epic event: The
Kṣatriyas among the Śūras, along with
Vāyavyas and others, brought wealth in
hundreds as tribute for the Rājasūya of
Yudhiṣṭhira ({%āhārṣuḥ kṣatriyā vittaṃ śataśo%}
{%'jātaśatrave%}) 2. 48. 12, 16; (Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, however, who like Śūrasenas,
are sections of Yādavas, are reported to
have not given tribute for the Rājasūya
2. 48. 42).
