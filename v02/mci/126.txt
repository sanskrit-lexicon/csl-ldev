{@Jaṭāyus, Jaṭāyu@}¦ m.: A mythical vul-
ture ({%gṛdhra%}).
{@A.@} Birth: Very strong ({%vīryavant,%}
{%mahābala%}) son of Aruṇa from his wife Śyenī;
brother of Sampāti 1. 60. 67; 3. 263. 1.
{@B.@} Status: Chief or king of vultures
({%gṛdhrarāja%}) 3. 263. 1, 6, 17; 3. 266. 49;
({%gṛdhrapati%}) 3. 266. 49. {@C.@} Huge shape:
Looked like a mountain 3. 263. 15, or a
mountain peak 3. 263. 6. {@D.@} Association;
Friend of Daśaratha 3. 263. 1, 17, 21; hence
interested in the welfare of Rāma ({%rāma-%}
{%priyahitaiṣin%}) 3. 263. 5; hence also referred to
Sītā as his daughter-in-law ({%snuṣā%}) 3. 263. 2,
({%vadhū%}) 3. 263. 3. {@E.@} Help to Rāma:
From a mountain top he saw Rāvaṇa abduct-
ing Sītā 3. 262. 41; he saw her on Rāvaṇa's
lap; flew up to Rāvaṇa and asked him to
release Sītā; when Rāvaṇa did not oblige, he
attacked Rāvaṇa with nails, wings, and beak
and wounded him severely; Rāvaṇa cut off his
‘arms’ ({%bhujau%}) (that is wings) with sword
3. 263. 2-5; when Rāma saw Jaṭāyu he mis-
took him for a demon; Jaṭāyu told Rāma who
he was and about the abduction of Sītā; he
also told that he was wounded on account of
Sītā 1. 263. 16-19; {@F.@} End: When asked in
which direction Rāvaṇa escaped Jaṭāyu could
‘tell’ only with the movement of his head,
and he died; Rāma knew Jaṭāyu meant south;
Rāma cremated him with due rites 3. 263.
15-21; 3. 258. 2; Sampāti, Jaṭāyu's brother,
surprised when he heard Hanūmant and others
talking about Jaṭāyu; Sampāti told them that
his wings were burnt, but not of Jaṭāyus,
when he and Jaṭāyus, in a competition, went
to the assembly of the sun ({%ādityasaṃsad%});
[Page023-a+ 39]
Hanūmant informed Sampāti about Jaṭāyu's
death 3. 266. 45-53.
