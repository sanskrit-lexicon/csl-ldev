<div n="lb">12. 347. 15; {%bhujagasattama%} 12. 352. 2;
<div n="lb">{%uragaśreṣṭha%} 12. 353. 1; {%dvijaśreṣṭha%} 12.

<div n="lb">349. 1; {%bhogapati%} 12. 352. 9; {%bhujagapati%}
<div n="lb">12. 353. 9). {@G.@} Wife and Relatives:
<div n="lb">His wife, not named ({%nāgapatnī%} 12. 345. 4,
<div n="lb">{%nāgī%} 12. 345. 13), virtuous and devoted;
<div n="lb">she knew what the duties of a student and a
<div n="lb">servant were, was familiar with the duties of
<div n="lb">the four {%varṇas,%} and knew the duties of a
<div n="lb">householder and his wife; she had learnt these
<div n="lb">from her husband Padma; she therefore made
<div n="lb">no mistake in receiving the guests during the
<div n="lb">absence of her husband; on a certain occasion
<div n="lb">she duly received and honoured a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">who arrived at Padma's residence 12. 345. 4-
<div n="lb">12; when Padma arrived she informed him
<div n="lb">about the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa who wanted
<div n="lb">to meet him and had taken his residence on
<div n="lb">the river Gomatī; she advised Padma to see
<div n="lb">the Brāhmaṇa 12. 347. 13-16; Padma's sense
<div n="lb">of pride was hurt since he was commanded
<div n="lb">by a Brāhmaṇa to go and meet him; he there-
<div n="lb">fore asked his wife whether the Brāhmaṇa was
<div n="lb">really a human being or a god in disguise 12.
<div n="lb">348. 1-2; his wife told him that she did not
<div n="lb">consider the Brāhmaṇa to be a god (in dis-
<div n="lb">guise); she advised her husband to give up his
[Page036-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">inborn anger ({%tad roṣaṃ sahajaṃ tyaktvā%}
<div n="lb">12. 348. 8) and go and meet the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">12. 348. 5-8; Padma realized that he was
<div n="lb">too proud, that being the fault of his species
<div n="lb">({%jātidoṣa%} 12. 348. 13), and was happy that
<div n="lb">his wife had burnt his anger by her admoni-
<div n="lb">tion ({%dagdho vācāgninā tvayā%} 12. 348. 13);
<div n="lb">he felt himself praiseworthy to have such a
<div n="lb">virtuous wife 12. 348. 13-14, 18-19; during
<div n="lb">Padma's absence his relatives—brothers,
<div n="lb">sons and wife—had gone to the river Gomatī
<div n="lb">to persuade the Brāhmaṇa who almost
<div n="lb">starved himself to take some food but he did
<div n="lb">not; they returned home without achieving
<div n="lb">their purpose 12. 346. 1-13. {@H.@} Padma's
<div n="lb">functions: It was his duty to pull by
<div n="lb">rotation the sun's one-wheeled chariot for
<div n="lb">a month (in a year ?) ({%sūryarathaṃ voḍhuṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%gato'sau māsacārikaḥ%} 12. 345. 8; {%vivasvato%}
<div n="lb">{%gacchati paryayeṇa voḍhuṃ bhavāṃs taṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%ratham ekacakram%} 12. 350. 1). {@I.@} Padma
<div n="lb">and the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya (12. 349.
<div n="lb">5): Padma returned home after he had
<div n="lb">performed his duty of drawing the Sun's cha-
<div n="lb">riot and was permitted by the god to leave;
<div n="lb">he was then informed by his wife about
<div n="lb">the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa; she informed
<div n="lb">Padma that the Brāhmaṇa had asked him to
<div n="lb">meet him; Padma's initial reaction, due
<div n="lb">to his sense of pride, was not to oblige the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa; but on the advice of his wife he
<div n="lb">relented and met the Brāhmaṇa; he then told
<div n="lb">his wife that he realized that it was not in
<div n="lb">one's interest to get angry for in bygone days,
<div n="lb">Rāvaṇa, Kārtavīrya and his sons were killed
<div n="lb">due to their anger 12. 348. 13-17; he appro-
<div n="lb">ached the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya and asked
<div n="lb">him what he wanted 12. 349. 3-4, 9-12; the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa first asked Padma a question; after
<div n="lb">hearing Padma's answer, the Brāhmaṇa would
<div n="lb">tell Padma the purpose of his visit 12. 349.
[Page036-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">16; the Brāhmaṇa asked Padma to tell him if
<div n="lb">while pulling the god Sun's chariot. he saw
<div n="lb">anything wonderful on his way 12. 350. 1;
<div n="lb">Padma first told the Brāhmaṇa that there was
<div n="lb">nothing more wonderful than the Sun himself
<div n="lb">(accomplished sages and deities resort to his
<div n="lb">rays; wind resorts to sun's rays and flows
<div n="lb">from there to fill the sky; rain water is released
<div n="lb">by his dark foot (ray ?), Śukra by name,
<div n="lb">({%śukro nāmāsitaḥ pādo yasya vāridharo%}
<div n="lb">{%'mbare/toyaṃ sṛjati varṣāsu%} 12. 350. 4);
<div n="lb">Sun takes back the rain water with his shining
<div n="lb">ray during eight months; the soul ({%ātmā%}) is
<div n="lb">for all times established in his lustre; he is the
<div n="lb">seed of everything, movable and immovable
<div n="lb">and the earth is sustained by him; the long-
<div n="lb">armed, eternal, unalterable god having no
<div n="lb">beginning and no end resides in the sun 12.
<div n="lb">350. 2-7); Padma next told him that one day
<div n="lb">something unusual happened: while the Sun
<div n="lb">was shining brightly at mid-day, there
<div n="lb">suddenly appeared light in all directions, light
<div n="lb">similar to that of the sun; then, as if tearing
<div n="lb">open the sky a being, looking like a second Sun
<div n="lb">({%dvitīya iva bhāskaraḥ%} 12. 350. 11), appro-
<div n="lb">ached the Sun; the Sun held out his hand to
<div n="lb">receive him and the other being also extended
<div n="lb">his right hand to hold the Sun's hand; then
<div n="lb">the being entered the Sun's disc 12. 350. 8-15;
<div n="lb">confused as to who was the real Sun—the one
<div n="lb">in the chariot or the one that arrived from the
<div n="lb">sky—Padma and others asked the Sun to
<div n="lb">explain; the Sun told them that the one who
<div n="lb">entered him was a sage who observed the vow
<div n="lb">of {%uñchavṛtti%} (living only on grains fallen in
<div n="lb">the field); the sage also lived successively on
<div n="lb">fruit, roots, fallen leaves, water and air and
<div n="lb">recited the {%ṛc%} stanzas; that Brāhmaṇa (sage)
<div n="lb">even now moved round the earth with the Sun
<div n="lb">—this was the wonder seen by Padma 12. 351.
<div n="lb">1-6; the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya, on hearing
[Page037-a+ 39]
<div n="lb">Padma's account, took leave of him without
<div n="lb">telling him the purpose of his visit; to the
<div n="lb">perplexed Padma, Dharmāraṇya explained
<div n="lb">that he was only curious to know what led to
<div n="lb">the accumulation of merit ({%puṇyasaṃcaya%});
<div n="lb">now that he knew how one did it, he had
<div n="lb">decided to observe {%uñchavrata;%} the purpose
<div n="lb">of his visit was served ({%kṛtārtho 'smi%}) and
<div n="lb">hence he was leaving 12. 352. 1-10.
