({%atrāyaṃ kṣemadarśīyam itihāso 'nugīyate%})
12. 105. 2.
<div n="P">It was narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣ-
ṭhira in reply to his question how a righte-
ous king, when oppressed by his ministers
and deprived of his treasure and authority
({%cyutaḥ kośāc ca daṇḍāc ca%}), should act if
he sought happiness 12. 105. 1-2; this advice
was earlier sought by prince Kṣemadarśa
(and hence so called) from the sage Kālaka-
vṛkṣīya 12. 105. 3 ff.
