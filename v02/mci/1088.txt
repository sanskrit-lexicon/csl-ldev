{@Kapilasya tīrtham@}¦ nt.: Name of a
{%tīrtha;%} also called {@Nāgatīrtha.@}
<div n="P">Described as famous among all the
worlds ({%sarvalokeṣu viśrutam%}); it was sacred
to Kapila, the chief of the Nāgas ({%nāga-%}
{%rājasya kapilasya%}) 3. 82. 28; hence also
known as Nāgatīrtha 3. 82. 29; by bathing
there one obtained the fruit of giving a
thousand tawny cows ({%kapilānāṃ sahasrasya%}
{%phalam%}) 3. 82. 29 (this perhaps explains the
name of the {%tīrtha%}). [See {@Kapilātīrtha@}]
