Mārkaṇḍeya, while instructing Yudhiṣṭhira,
told him that to honour the old injunction
[Page274-b+ 40]
laid down by Brahman the Saptarṣis shine
in the sky; hence no one should violate the
injunction considering himself to be strong

wars: Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that the
soldiers in the army, while fighting, should
keep the constellation Ursa Major at the
back and remain steady like mountains;
this way one could wish to win even the
unconquerable opponents ({%saptarṣīn pṛṣṭha-%}

16. {@D.@} Omens: Among the omens
noticed by Vyāsa before the war one was
related to the position of the two planets
having copper-red and ruddy crests (Rāhu
and Ketu ?) who obscured the brilliance of
the lofty stars of the Ursa Major ({%grahau%}

Brāhmaṇa instructed his wife that there was
only one relative, no other; he dwelt in our
heart; (in saying this) the Brāhmaṇa was only
repeating what the relative within had said
to him: instructed by the relative within
people have relatives; they shine (like ?) the
stars of the Ursa Major ({%eko bandhur nāsti%}
