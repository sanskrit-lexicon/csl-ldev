the Yavanas to be there; they were there
with chariots and horse-men, and foot-soldiers;
in the middle of the front of the army stood
Karṇa himself to guard it; he was offered

by different armies; he was followed by
Duryodhana with his brothers on horse-backs,
and the Madras and the Kekayas to protect
him; Aśvatthāman, the Kuru heroes, and
elephants mounted by the Mlecchas were
behind the army of the chariot-fighters ({%anva-%}
{%yus tad rathānīkam%}); they were assisted
by horse-men ({%sādibhiś cāsthitāḥ%}); many
thousands of brave warriors, who would not
show their backs, armed with {%paṭṭiśa%} and
swords, acted as foot-guards of elephants and
of foot-soldiers (?) ({%teṣāṃ padātināgānāṃ%}
{%pādarakṣāḥ sahasraśaḥ%} 8. 31. 24); the
Bārhaspatya vyūha shone like the army of
