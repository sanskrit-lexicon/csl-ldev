ginning with the Bhāratavarṣa in the south
and ending with the Airāvata in the north
(in between lay Haimavata, Hari, Ilāvṛta,
Śveta and Hairaṇyaka, See Nī. on Bom. Ed.
6. 6. 37-38), each succeeding one excelled
its immediately preceding one in the dura-
tion of life, in health, as well as in quali-
ties related to {%dharma, kāma%} and {%artha;%}
people lived there in association with one
other ({%uttarottaram etebhyo varṣam udri-%}

as though all light; men are born there
having the brightness, colour and fragrance
of lotus, and having eyes like lotus leaves;
their eyes do not wink, they are fragrant,
they live without food, and have control
over their sense-organs; they are all descend-
ed from the world of gods and are free from
the quality of passion; their life span is of
thirteen thousand years ({%na tatra sūryas%}
