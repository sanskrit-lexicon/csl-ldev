dressed in red robes, and wearing red decora-
tions and gold strings; they had formed a cove-
nant ({%kṛtābhisamayāḥ%} 7. 33. 13); they shared
their grief with each other, they were of equal
daring and they vied with each other (in
this regard), and were intent on each other's
well-being ({%anyonyasamaduḥkhās te anyo-%}

penetrate the Cakravyūha: Penetrating
the {%vyūha%} was a task difficult to be ac-
complished 7. 32. 19 ({%duṣkaraṃ karma%}), a
burden difficult to bear ({%aviṣahyaṃ guruṃ%}
{%bhāram%}) 7. 34. 12; its penetration ({%bheda%})
not known to any one except Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna,
Pradyumna and Abhimanyu; even Abhi-

in case of emergency ({%notsahe tu vinir-%}
{%gantum ahaṃ kasyāṃcid āpadi%}) 7. 34.
14-15, 19; 7. 50. 20-21; Abhimanyu commis-
sioned by Yudhiṣṭhira to penetrate the {%vyūha%}

from the rear 7. 34. 16-17; 20-23, 7. 32. 18;
