{@Suśobhanā@}¦ f.: Name of the frog
princess.
<div n="P">Daughter of the frog king Āyu 3. 190. 37;
she was once seen by the Ikṣvāku king Parikṣit
of Ayodhyā while he had gone for hunting;
she had assumed the form of an extremely
beautiful girl and attracted the king by her
sweet voice; when she informed the king that
she was a maiden ({%kanyāsmi%} 3. 190. 13),
he expressed his desire to marry her; she
gave her consent on condition ({%samaya%}
3. 190. 15, 16) that she should not be shown
water; the king agreed and stayed with her
and took her to his town; he sported with
her in isolation and did not attend to any-
thing else; the king then lived with her in a
large forest which was without water ({%vanam%}
[Page077-a+ 39]
{%idam udāram anudakam%} 3. 190 23); it was
got ready for him by his minister; once
while sporting with her the king became
thirsty; they saw a well full of water; when
asked by the king to descend into the well-
water, Suśobhanā entered it and disappeared;
when the king did not see her, he got the well
emptied and saw a frog at the mouth of a
hole; the angered king ordered the killing of
all the frogs; when the frog king Āyu, in the
form of a hermit, requested Parikṣit not to
kill the innocent frogs he said that they had
eaten up his beloved; the frog king then in-
formed king Parikṣit that his beloved was his
(Āyu's) daughter Suśobhanā who had cheated
many kings before; this was her bad character
({%tasyā dauḥśīlyam etat%} 3. 190. 37); king
Parikṣit told Āyu that he wanted Suśobhanā
and that she might be given back to him; Āyu
gave Suśobhanā to Parikṣit and asked her to
serve the king; he cursed his daughter that
since she had cheated kings her children will
not be good to Brāhmaṇas due to her false-
hood ({%abrahmaṇyāni tavāpatyāni bhaviṣya-%}
{%nty anṛtakatvāt tava%} 3. 190. 40); the king
having got back Suśobhanā felt as if be had
obtained the overlordship of the three worlds;
Suśobhanā later gave birth to three sons Śala,
Dala and Bala 3. 190. 3-43.
