{@C.@} Epic events: (1) The Pāṇḍavas lived
there intermittently during the term of exile:
when {%svasti%} was pronounced on the Pāṇḍavas,
they proceeded toward the Kāmyaka forest
for their {%vanavāsa%} 3. 4. 10; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra
blamed Vidura for siding with the Pāṇḍavas
and asked him to leave, if he so desired, he
went to the Kāmyaka anxious to meet the
Pāṇḍavas there 3. 6. 5; later, Saṃjaya went
to the Kāmyaka to bring Vidura back to
Hāstinapura 3. 7. 10; from the Kāmyaka
the Pāṇḍavas proceeded to the holy lake

{%puṇyaṃ dvaitavanaṃ saraḥ%}) and entered the
forest of the same name ({%puṇyaṃ dvaita-%}

[Page308-a+ 40]
25. 13, 16; 3. 26. 1; 3. 37. 31; from there
they returned to the Kāmyaka under instruc-
tions of Vyāsa; they were followed by learned
Brāmhaṇas; having reached Kāmyaka again
the Pāṇḍavas settled down there with their
counsellors and followers ({%tataḥ kāmyakam%}
{%āsādya punas te bharatarṣabhāḥ/nyaviśanta%}
{%mahātmānaḥ sāmātyāḥ sapadānugāḥ%}) 3.
37. 31, 37, 39; even after Arjuna left for the
Śakraloka to acquire divine weapons, the
rest of the Pāṇḍavas continued to live with
Draupadī in the Kāmyaka forest 3. 49. 2;
3. 80. 1; after Arjuna's departure from the
Kāmyaka to acquire divine weapons (3. 79.
1), the Pāṇḍavas felt dejected 3. 79. 4-7;
3. 161. 15; neither Draupadī (3. 79. 12-14),
nor Bhīma (3. 79. 22), nor Nakula (3. 79.
25), nor Sahadeva (3. 79. 29) found the
forest as beautiful as before; the divine sage
Nārada came there to meet them 3. 80. 2;
since the Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī were no
longer properly attentive ({%avadhānaṃ na%}
{%gacchāmaḥ kāmyake%} 3. 84. 16) and found
no delight in their continued stay in the Kām-
yaka in the absence of Arjuna, Yudhiṣṭhira
asked Dhaumya to suggest to him some other
forest rich in food and fruits 3. 84. 17, 20;
before the Pāṇḍavas left for their {%tīrthayātrā,%}
they lived in the Kāmyaka for three nights
with the sage Lomaśa 3. 90. 24; when Arjuna
had left the Pāṇḍavas to go to the Indraloka,
Ghaṭotkaca arrived at the Kāmyaka to help
the Pāṇḍavas to proceed to the Gandhamādana
mountain; he remained with them till Arjuna's
return 7. 158. 28 (a reference to 3. 144. 23-27);
Draupadī desired Bhīma to carry the heavenly
{%saugandhika%} flower to the Kāmyaka {%āśrama,%}
since she wanted to present it to Yudhiṣṭhira;
she would also take with her other flowers
which Bhīma might collect ({%harer idaṃ me%}
[Page308-b+ 40]
{%kāmāya kāmyake punar āśrame/ … tāny-%}
{%ahaṃ netum icchāmi kāmyakaṃ punar%}
{%āśramam%}) 3. 146. 10-11; when Arjuna came
back to the Pāṇḍavas on the Gandhamādana
mountain from the Indraloka in the company
of Indra, the latter advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
return to the hermitage Kāmyaka ({%svasti%}
{%prāpnuhi kaunteya kāmyakaṃ punar āśra-%}
{%mam%}) 3. 162. 12; on their way back, they
stayed at the Dvaitavana lake on the river
Sarasvatī (3. 174. 21) from where they
reached the holy Kāmyaka {%āśrama%} full of
ascetics ({%dadṛśuḥ kāmyakaṃ puṇyam āśra-%}
{%maṃ tāpasāyutam%} 3. 244. 15) and the Kām-
yaka forest where they settled down again
3. 179. 18; ({%kāmyakaṃ prāpya kaunteyāḥ%}
{% … niṣeduḥ saha kṛṣṇayā%}) 3. 180. 1; a
certain Brāhmaṇa, friend of Arjuna, told the
Pāṇḍavas that Kṛṣṇa and the sage Mārkaṇ-
ḍeya would come there to visit them 3. 180.
3-6, 39; while the Pāṇḍavas were in the
Kāmyaka forest (not named) they completed
eleven years of their exile ({%vane nivasatāṃ%}
{%teṣāṃ … varṣāny ekādaśātīyuḥ%}) 3. 245. 1;
the Pāṇḍavas lived delightfully in the Kām-
yaka which was full of deer 3. 248. 1; Vār-
dhakṣatri (Jayadratha), the king of the
Sindhus, on his way to the Śālveyas, happened
to pass through the Kāmyaka 3. 248. 6-7;
when Draupadī was being forcibly carried
away by Jayadratha she was confident that
she would return to the Kāmyaka to meet her
husbands 3. 252. 21; the Pāṇḍavas conti-
nued to live in the Kāmyaka after the Jaya-
dratha episode 3. 256. 30; it was here that
the sage Mārkaṇḍeya narrated to the Pāṇḍa-
vas the story of Rāma and of Sāvitrī 3. 283.
16; at the end of the twelfth year ({%dvādaśe%}
{%'bde vyatīte%} 3. 294. 41), the Pāṇḍavas, to-
gether with the Brāhmaṇas, once again went
[Page309-a+ 40]
to the Dvaitavana from the Kāmyaka forest
3. 294. 42-43; 3. 295. 2-3; (2) The Bhojas,
the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas, and many others,
under the leadership of Vāsudeva, had gone
to the Kāmyaka to meet the Pāṇḍavas 3. 13.
1-4; (3) A demon, Kirmīra by name and
brother of Baka, lived there 3. 12. 22; the
forest was always avoided from a distance by
ascetics and other forest-dwellers due to the
fear of man-eating demons ({%puruṣādabhayāt%}
{%kila%}) 3. 12. 4-5. {@D.@} Similies: (1) When
Arjuna left, the (Kāmyaka) forest was to
the Pāṇḍavas like the Caitraratha {%vana%} in
the absence of Kubera 3. 79. 6; (2) The
Pāṇḍavas entered the Kāmyaka as do the
righteous the heaven 3. 244. 16; (3) When
Draupadī was abducted, Yudhiṣṭhira, noticing
certain omens, said that the Kāmyaka appear-
ed to him like a lake from where serpents had
been taken away, a kingdom without prospe-
rity in the absence of a king, or (an empty)
jar from which wine had been drunk by drun-
kards ({%saraḥ suparṇena hṛtoragaṃ yathā%}
{%rāṣṭraṃ yathārājakam āttalakṣmi/evaṃ-%}
{%vidhaṃ me pratibhāti kāmyakaṃ śauṇḍair%}
