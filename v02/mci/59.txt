<div n="lb">5. 101. 4, 17; also mentioned among the sons
[Page011-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">of Kadrū, listed by Sūta at the request of
<div n="lb">Śaunaka 1. 31. 5, 2; often mentioned with
<div n="lb">serpent Dhanaṃjaya ({%karkoṭakadhanaṃ-%}
<div n="lb">{%jayau%}) 1. 31. 5; 2. 9. 9; 5. 101. 9. {@B.@} Descrip-
<div n="lb">tion and status: Marked with gem, {%svastika,%}
<div n="lb">circles, {%kamaṇḍalu%} (ascetic's vessel); having
<div n="lb">mouths in varying numbers 5. 101. 5-7; king
<div n="lb">of serpents ({%nāgarājan%}) 3. 64. 3; 3. 75. 17;
<div n="lb">({%nāgarāja%}) 3. 70. 32; no other serpent his
<div n="lb">equal ({%matsamo nāsti pannagaḥ%} 3. 63. 7).
<div n="lb">{@C.@} Activities: Waits, with other {%nāgas,%} on
<div n="lb">Varuṇa in his {%sabhā%} 2. 9. 9; present among
<div n="lb">those who arrived to greet Arjuna's birth 1. 114,
<div n="lb">60; one of the {%nāgas%} who received the white
<div n="lb">snake issuing from the mouth of Balarāma
<div n="lb">and entering the ocean 16. 5. 14. {@D.@} Part
<div n="lb">played in the Nala story: Nala heard him
<div n="lb">inviting for help and saw him lying in coils in
<div n="lb">a forest fire; he introduced himself as Nāga
<div n="lb">Karkoṭaka; he once seized ({%?pralabdha%}) a
<div n="lb">Brahmanical sage and, due to his curse, was
<div n="lb">since unable to move; agreed to become
<div n="lb">Nala's friend and, if saved by Nala,
<div n="lb">assured to teach him something which
<div n="lb">would stand him in good stead ({%śreyaḥ%});
<div n="lb">Karkoṭaka could change his size at will and
<div n="lb">become of the size of a thumb; he asked
<div n="lb">Nala to take him some distance and
<div n="lb">while doing so count his steps; Nala picked
<div n="lb">him up and took him to a place where there
<div n="lb">was no fire; at the tenth step ({%daśame%}
<div n="lb">{%pade%}) he bit Nala when, apparently, Nala
<div n="lb">must have uttered the word {%daśa%} (which
<div n="lb">was also a command to bite); as a result Nala
<div n="lb">became deformed ({%vikṛta%}); Karkoṭaka as-
<div n="lb">sumed his natural form and advised Nala to
<div n="lb">go to king Ṛtuparṇa of Ayodhyā; Karkoṭaka
<div n="lb">changed Nala's appearance so that no one
<div n="lb">should recognize him; he gave Nala two pieces
<div n="lb">of cloth and asked him to put them on,
<div n="lb">after remembering Karkoṭaka, to regain his
[Page011-b+ 39]
<div n="lb">original form 3. 63. 1-24; the piece of cloth
<div n="lb">was free from dust ({%vastram arajaḥ%}), and
<div n="lb">when Nala did, as advised, he regained his
<div n="lb">original form 3. 75. 17; Kali who had entered
<div n="lb">Nala's body was all along burning due to the
<div n="lb">sharp ({%tīkṣṇa%}) poison of Karkoṭaka which was
<div n="lb">in Nala's body; when Kali came out of Nala's
<div n="lb">body he vomitted this poison 3. 70. 27, 32.
