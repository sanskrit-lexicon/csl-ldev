{@Karkoṭaka@}¦ m.: A mythical serpent,
living in Bhogavatī Purī 5. 101. 9, 1.
{@A.@} Birth: Son of Surasā and Kaśyapa
5. 101. 4, 17; also mentioned among the sons
[Page011-a+ 41]
of Kadrū, listed by Sūta at the request of
Śaunaka 1. 31. 5, 2; often mentioned with
serpent Dhanaṃjaya ({%karkoṭakadhanaṃ-%}
{%jayau%}) 1. 31. 5; 2. 9. 9; 5. 101. 9. {@B.@} Descrip-
tion and status: Marked with gem, {%svastika,%}
circles, {%kamaṇḍalu%} (ascetic's vessel); having
mouths in varying numbers 5. 101. 5-7; king
of serpents ({%nāgarājan%}) 3. 64. 3; 3. 75. 17;
({%nāgarāja%}) 3. 70. 32; no other serpent his
equal ({%matsamo nāsti pannagaḥ%} 3. 63. 7).
{@C.@} Activities: Waits, with other {%nāgas,%} on
Varuṇa in his {%sabhā%} 2. 9. 9; present among
those who arrived to greet Arjuna's birth 1. 114,
60; one of the {%nāgas%} who received the white
snake issuing from the mouth of Balarāma
and entering the ocean 16. 5. 14. {@D.@} Part
played in the Nala story: Nala heard him
inviting for help and saw him lying in coils in
a forest fire; he introduced himself as Nāga
Karkoṭaka; he once seized ({%?pralabdha%}) a
Brahmanical sage and, due to his curse, was
since unable to move; agreed to become
Nala's friend and, if saved by Nala,
assured to teach him something which
would stand him in good stead ({%śreyaḥ%});
Karkoṭaka could change his size at will and
become of the size of a thumb; he asked
Nala to take him some distance and
while doing so count his steps; Nala picked
him up and took him to a place where there
was no fire; at the tenth step ({%daśame%}
{%pade%}) he bit Nala when, apparently, Nala
must have uttered the word {%daśa%} (which
was also a command to bite); as a result Nala
became deformed ({%vikṛta%}); Karkoṭaka as-
sumed his natural form and advised Nala to
go to king Ṛtuparṇa of Ayodhyā; Karkoṭaka
changed Nala's appearance so that no one
should recognize him; he gave Nala two pieces
of cloth and asked him to put them on,
after remembering Karkoṭaka, to regain his
[Page011-b+ 39]
original form 3. 63. 1-24; the piece of cloth
was free from dust ({%vastram arajaḥ%}), and
when Nala did, as advised, he regained his
original form 3. 75. 17; Kali who had entered
Nala's body was all along burning due to the
sharp ({%tīkṣṇa%}) poison of Karkoṭaka which was
in Nala's body; when Kali came out of Nala's
body he vomitted this poison 3. 70. 27, 32.
