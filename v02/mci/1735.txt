{@Śītavana@}¦ nt.: Name of a forest.
<div n="P">There is a {%tīrtha%} in this forest; it is
great and one similar to it is difficult to find
elsewhere ({%tīrthaṃ tatra mahārāja mahad%}
{%anyatra durlabham%}); one who is controlled
and takes limited food ({%niyato niyatāśanaḥ%})

(however Arjunamiśra: {%ekam iti tṛtīyārthe%}
