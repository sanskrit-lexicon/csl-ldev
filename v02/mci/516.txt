<div n="lb">(1) Śiva killed with it all Daityas in the battle
<div n="lb">7. 57. 16; (all the enemies of gods) 7. 57. 65;
<div n="lb">(2) Śiva charged his arrow with the Pāśupata

<div n="lb">(8. 24. 4, 10-12); 13. 14. 128. {@C.@} Śiva
[Page115-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">gave it to (1) Arjuna: Two accounts:
<div n="lb">(i) Arjuna desired to have Śiva's Pāśupata
<div n="lb">missile so that he could burn the Dānavas,
<div n="lb">the Rākṣasas, the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the
<div n="lb">Gandharvas and the mythical serpents
<div n="lb">({%pannagas%}) in battle; he could then be a
<div n="lb">match for Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, and Karṇa
<div n="lb">3. 41. 7, 9, 11; Arjuna called it Brahma-
<div n="lb">śiras which was terrific and of fierce power
<div n="lb">({%yat tad brahmaśiro nāma raudraṃ bhīma-%}
<div n="lb">{%parākramam%}) 3. 41. 8; Śiva ready to give
<div n="lb">Pāśupata, his dear weapon ({%dayitam astram%}),
<div n="lb">to Arjuna as he was capable of possessing
<div n="lb">({%dhāraṇa%}), releasing ({%mokṣa%}), and with-
<div n="lb">drawing ({%saṃhāra%}) it 3. 41. 13; to receive
<div n="lb">it, Arjuna purified himself and remained fully
<div n="lb">attentive ({%śucir bhūtvā samāhitaḥ%}); he
<div n="lb">folded his hands and said to Śiva ‘recite (the
<div n="lb">mantra)’ ({%adhīṣva%}); Śiva then taught it
<div n="lb">to Arjuna together with its secrets and mode
<div n="lb">of withdrawal ({%sarahasyanivartanam%}) 3. 41.
<div n="lb">17-18; the missile, like the God of Death in
<div n="lb">bodily form, then waited on Arjuna; at that
<div n="lb">time the earth trembled and there was a loud
<div n="lb">sound of conches, drums and {%bheris%} by thou-
<div n="lb">sands; the gods and demons saw the missile
<div n="lb">in bodily form standing near Arjuna 3. 41.
<div n="lb">17-22; 1. 1. 109; 3. 163. 48, 51; 6. 116. 38;
<div n="lb">8. 57. 44; (ii) During the night, after Arjuna
<div n="lb">took the vow to kill Jayadratha the next
<div n="lb">day before sunset, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to
<div n="lb">acquire the knowledge of the great Pāśupata
<div n="lb">missile from Śiva in order to be able to
<div n="lb">accomplish his vow; Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna
<div n="lb">to mentally approach god Śiva; Arjuna
<div n="lb">touched water ({%saṃspṛśyāmbhaḥ%}), sat down
<div n="lb">on the ground, and mentally went to Bhava
<div n="lb">(Śiva) 7. 57. 17-19; Arjuna praised Śiva and
<div n="lb">made him favourable to give the missile 7.
<div n="lb">57. 59; Śiva told Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa that
[Page115-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">nearby there was a lake of nectar where he
<div n="lb">had left his divine bow and arrow; he asked
<div n="lb">them to get his bow and arrow 7. 57. 64-
<div n="lb">65; when they brought the bow and arrow,
<div n="lb">a Brahmacārin came from the side of Śiva; he
<div n="lb">held the bow and, putting the arrow on it,
<div n="lb">drew it according the prescriptions ({%vyakarṣac%}
<div n="lb">{%cāpi vidhivat saśaraṃ dhanur uttamam%} 7.
<div n="lb">57. 75); having seen how the Brahmacārin
<div n="lb">held the bow in his grip, how he drew the
<div n="lb">string, and the posture adopted by him
<div n="lb">({%tasya maurvīṃ ca muṣṭiṃ ca sthānaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%cālakṣya pāṇḍavaḥ%} 7. 57. 76), and having
<div n="lb">heard the {%mantra%} recited by Śiva, Arjuna
<div n="lb">understood the way how to employ Pāśupata;
<div n="lb">the arrow was shot by the Brahmacārin in
<div n="lb">the lake and the bow was again placed in
<div n="lb">it; Arjuna then remembered the boon Śiva
<div n="lb">granted to him during his stay in the forest
<div n="lb">({%āraṇyaka%}) and his meeting Śiva, and wished
<div n="lb">that he might now receive the boon; knowing
<div n="lb">Ariuna's mind, Śiva gave him the boon, the
<div n="lb">Pāśupata missile, and wished him success in
<div n="lb">accomplishing his vow; Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
<div n="lb">bowed down to Śiva and, when permitted to
<div n="lb">leave, delighted they returned to their camp,
<div n="lb">7. 57. 73-81; (Śiva gave missile to Arjuna
<div n="lb">7. 173. 100); (2) Besides Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa
<div n="lb">knew the use of Pāśupata 7. 57. 79; 8.
<div n="lb">57. 44; Bhīṣma is not so sure about Kṛṣṇa's
<div n="lb">knowledge of the Pāśupata 6. 116. 39.
<div n="lb">{@D.@} Effects: The missile, when released,
<div n="lb">produced thousands of tridents ({%śūlas%}),
<div n="lb">fierce maces ({%gadāś cograpradarśanāḥ%}),
<div n="lb">and charmed arrows having the form of
<div n="lb">serpents ({%śarāś cāśīviṣākārāḥ saṃbhavanty%}
<div n="lb">{%anumantritāḥ%}) 3. 41. 10. {@E.@} Restrictions
<div n="lb">on its use: Arjuna was specifically told by
<div n="lb">Śiva that the missile was never to be used
<div n="lb">against men ({%na prayojyaṃ bhaved etan%}
[Page116-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">{%mānuṣeṣu kathaṃcana%}); Arjuna was to
<div n="lb">use the missile only if he was under
<div n="lb">severe pressure ({%pīḍyamānena balavat%}),
<div n="lb">or if he wished to ward off the missiles
<div n="lb">used by his opponents ({%astrāṇāṃ prati-%}
<div n="lb">{%ghāte ca sarvathaiva prayojayeḥ%}) 3. 163.
<div n="lb">49-50; 3. 41. 15; if used against ordinary
<div n="lb">persons it would burn the entire world
<div n="lb">3. 41. 15. {@F.@} Use in the epic war:
<div n="lb">(1) Arjuna in his message to the Kauravas,
<div n="lb">sent through Saṃjaya, threatened that he
<div n="lb">would use the Pāśupata missile against them in
<div n="lb">the war 5. 47. 100; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that in
<div n="lb">the ‘sacrifice to be performed with the wea-
<div n="lb">pons’ ({%śastrayajña%} 5. 139. 29), the {%mantras%}
<div n="lb">recited by Arjuna while releasing the Pāśupata
<div n="lb">and other missiles would serve as the {%mantras%}
<div n="lb">used while performing a sacrifice 5. 139. 31;
<div n="lb">(2) Droṇa used Pāśupata against Arjuna
<div n="lb">and it was repelled ({%jaghāna%}) by Arjuna
<div n="lb">presumably by using the same missile 7.
<div n="lb">163. 28; (3) Karṇa used it against Yudhi-
<div n="lb">ṣṭhira and hence Kṛṣṇa apprehended Yudhi-
<div n="lb">ṣṭhira's death in the war 8. 43. 21, 18.
<div n="lb">{@G.@} Status: The Pāśupata missile surpassed
<div n="lb">all other missiles like Brāhma, Nārāyaṇa,
<div n="lb">Aindra, Āgneya, and Vāruṇa; it could
<div n="lb">destroy all weapons ({%sarvaśastravighātana%})
<div n="lb">13. 14. 127; even gods like Indra, Yama,
<div n="lb">Kubera, Varuṇa, and Vāyu did not know it
<div n="lb">3. 41. 14; there was none who could not be
<div n="lb">killed by it; besides its use on an arrow,
<div n="lb">it could be released even by mind, eye, and
<div n="lb">speech ({%manasā cakṣuṣā vācā dhanuṣā ca%}
<div n="lb">{%nipātyate%}) 3. 41. 16.
