{%nam%}) 3. 163. 52; capable of destroying the

44; described as having a terrible bodily form
—having one foot, large teeth, a thousand
heads and bellies, and a thousand arms,
tongues, and eyes—({%ekapādaṃ mahādaṃ-%}
{%ṣṭraṃ sahasraśirasodaram/sahasrabhuja-%}
{%jihvākṣam%}) 13. 14. 126. {@B.@} Use by Śiva:
(1) Śiva killed with it all Daityas in the battle
7. 57. 16; (all the enemies of gods) 7. 57. 65;
(2) Śiva charged his arrow with the Pāśupata
missile and shot it to burn the {%tripuras%} of the
three sons of Tāraka Asura 8. 24. 115, 120;
(8. 24. 4, 10-12); 13. 14. 128. {@C.@} Śiva
[Page115-a+ 40]
gave it to (1) Arjuna: Two accounts:
(i) Arjuna desired to have Śiva's Pāśupata
missile so that he could burn the Dānavas,
the Rākṣasas, the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the
Gandharvas and the mythical serpents
({%pannagas%}) in battle; he could then be a
match for Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, and Karṇa
3. 41. 7, 9, 11; Arjuna called it Brahma-
śiras which was terrific and of fierce power
({%yat tad brahmaśiro nāma raudraṃ bhīma-%}
{%parākramam%}) 3. 41. 8; Śiva ready to give
Pāśupata, his dear weapon ({%dayitam astram%}),
to Arjuna as he was capable of possessing
({%dhāraṇa%}), releasing ({%mokṣa%}), and with-
drawing ({%saṃhāra%}) it 3. 41. 13; to receive
it, Arjuna purified himself and remained fully
attentive ({%śucir bhūtvā samāhitaḥ%}); he
folded his hands and said to Śiva ‘recite (the
mantra)’ ({%adhīṣva%}); Śiva then taught it
to Arjuna together with its secrets and mode
of withdrawal ({%sarahasyanivartanam%}) 3. 41.
17-18; the missile, like the God of Death in
bodily form, then waited on Arjuna; at that
time the earth trembled and there was a loud
sound of conches, drums and {%bheris%} by thou-
sands; the gods and demons saw the missile
in bodily form standing near Arjuna 3. 41.
17-22; 1. 1. 109; 3. 163. 48, 51; 6. 116. 38;
8. 57. 44; (ii) During the night, after Arjuna
took the vow to kill Jayadratha the next
day before sunset, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to
acquire the knowledge of the great Pāśupata
missile from Śiva in order to be able to
accomplish his vow; Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna
to mentally approach god Śiva; Arjuna
touched water ({%saṃspṛśyāmbhaḥ%}), sat down
on the ground, and mentally went to Bhava
(Śiva) 7. 57. 17-19; Arjuna praised Śiva and
made him favourable to give the missile 7.
57. 59; Śiva told Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa that
[Page115-b+ 40]
nearby there was a lake of nectar where he
had left his divine bow and arrow; he asked
them to get his bow and arrow 7. 57. 64-
65; when they brought the bow and arrow,
a Brahmacārin came from the side of Śiva; he
held the bow and, putting the arrow on it,
drew it according the prescriptions ({%vyakarṣac%}
{%cāpi vidhivat saśaraṃ dhanur uttamam%} 7.
57. 75); having seen how the Brahmacārin
held the bow in his grip, how he drew the
string, and the posture adopted by him
({%tasya maurvīṃ ca muṣṭiṃ ca sthānaṃ%}
{%cālakṣya pāṇḍavaḥ%} 7. 57. 76), and having
heard the {%mantra%} recited by Śiva, Arjuna
understood the way how to employ Pāśupata;
the arrow was shot by the Brahmacārin in
the lake and the bow was again placed in
it; Arjuna then remembered the boon Śiva
granted to him during his stay in the forest
({%āraṇyaka%}) and his meeting Śiva, and wished
that he might now receive the boon; knowing
Ariuna's mind, Śiva gave him the boon, the
Pāśupata missile, and wished him success in
accomplishing his vow; Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
bowed down to Śiva and, when permitted to
leave, delighted they returned to their camp,
7. 57. 73-81; (Śiva gave missile to Arjuna
7. 173. 100); (2) Besides Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa
knew the use of Pāśupata 7. 57. 79; 8.
57. 44; Bhīṣma is not so sure about Kṛṣṇa's
knowledge of the Pāśupata 6. 116. 39.
{@D.@} Effects: The missile, when released,
produced thousands of tridents ({%śūlas%}),
fierce maces ({%gadāś cograpradarśanāḥ%}),
and charmed arrows having the form of
serpents ({%śarāś cāśīviṣākārāḥ saṃbhavanty%}
{%anumantritāḥ%}) 3. 41. 10. {@E.@} Restrictions
on its use: Arjuna was specifically told by
Śiva that the missile was never to be used
against men ({%na prayojyaṃ bhaved etan%}
[Page116-a+ 40]
{%mānuṣeṣu kathaṃcana%}); Arjuna was to
use the missile only if he was under
severe pressure ({%pīḍyamānena balavat%}),
or if he wished to ward off the missiles
used by his opponents ({%astrāṇāṃ prati-%}
{%ghāte ca sarvathaiva prayojayeḥ%}) 3. 163.
49-50; 3. 41. 15; if used against ordinary
persons it would burn the entire world
3. 41. 15. {@F.@} Use in the epic war:
(1) Arjuna in his message to the Kauravas,
sent through Saṃjaya, threatened that he
would use the Pāśupata missile against them in
the war 5. 47. 100; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that in
the ‘sacrifice to be performed with the wea-
pons’ ({%śastrayajña%} 5. 139. 29), the {%mantras%}
recited by Arjuna while releasing the Pāśupata
and other missiles would serve as the {%mantras%}
used while performing a sacrifice 5. 139. 31;
(2) Droṇa used Pāśupata against Arjuna
and it was repelled ({%jaghāna%}) by Arjuna
presumably by using the same missile 7.
163. 28; (3) Karṇa used it against Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and hence Kṛṣṇa apprehended Yudhi-
ṣṭhira's death in the war 8. 43. 21, 18.
{@G.@} Status: The Pāśupata missile surpassed
all other missiles like Brāhma, Nārāyaṇa,
Aindra, Āgneya, and Vāruṇa; it could
destroy all weapons ({%sarvaśastravighātana%})
13. 14. 127; even gods like Indra, Yama,
Kubera, Varuṇa, and Vāyu did not know it
3. 41. 14; there was none who could not be
killed by it; besides its use on an arrow,
it could be released even by mind, eye, and
speech ({%manasā cakṣuṣā vācā dhanuṣā ca%}
{%nipātyate%}) 3. 41. 16.
