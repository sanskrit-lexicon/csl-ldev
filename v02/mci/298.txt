{@Vāmyau@}¦ m. du.: Two horses so called
since they belonged to the sage Vāmadeva.
[Page052-b+ 41]
{@A.@} Description: ‘fast as mind’
({%manojavau%} 3. 190. 48), ‘jewels among
horses’ ({%aśvaratnau%} 3. 190. 52), ‘excellent
horse(s)’ ({%kalyāṇam patram%} 3. 190. 54).
{@B.@} Śala-Vāmadeva Episode: Śala the
king of Ayodhyā, once on a hunting expedi-
tion, pursued a deer; his charioteer told him
that it would not be possible for him to
overtake the deer even if the two Vāmya
horses were yoked to his chariot; when asked
by the king about those horses, the charioteer
told him that the two horses ran with the speed
of mind ({%manojavau%}); the king approached
Vāmadeva and requested him to give the two
horses to pursue the deer; Vāmadeva agreed
on condition that the horses be returned
without delay when the king's purpose was
served; the king yoked the horses to his
chariot, caught the deer, but did not return
the horses to Vāmadeva thinking that such
‘jewels among horses’ should not be in the
possession of the Brāhmaṇas ({%aśvaratnāv%}
{%imāv ayogyau brāhmaṇānām%} 3. 190. 52);
Vāmadeva, after waiting for a month, sent
his pupil to ask the king to return the
Vāmyas; the king refused to part with them
saying that the Brāhmaṇas did not need horses
({%kiṃ ca brāhmaṇānām aśvaih kāryam%} 3.
190. 57); Vāmadeva himself approached the
king and asked him to return the horses or
else he would be struck by Varuṇa with his
nooses; the king told Vāmadeva that draught
oxen were suitable for Brāhmaṇas and
that the two Vāmyas belonged to him as a
Kṣatriya; the king refused to hand over the
Vāmyas even when the Rākṣasas, the evil
spirits ({%yātuāhāna%}) created by Vāma-
deva's curse, struck the king with their
spikes and brought him down; Dala, the
brother of Śala, who was next appointed king
returned the Vāmya horses to Vāmadeva
[Page053-a+ 38]
after his two attempts to kill Vāmadeva were
foiled by the sage (3. 190. 44-82).
