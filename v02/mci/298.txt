{@Vāmyau@}¦ m. du.: Two horses so called
<div n="lb">since they belonged to the sage Vāmadeva.
[Page052-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Description: ‘fast as mind’
<div n="lb">({%manojavau%} 3. 190. 48), ‘jewels among
<div n="lb">horses’ ({%aśvaratnau%} 3. 190. 52), ‘excellent
<div n="lb">horse(s)’ ({%kalyāṇam patram%} 3. 190. 54).
<div n="lb">{@B.@} Śala-Vāmadeva Episode: Śala the
<div n="lb">king of Ayodhyā, once on a hunting expedi-
<div n="lb">tion, pursued a deer; his charioteer told him
<div n="lb">that it would not be possible for him to
<div n="lb">overtake the deer even if the two Vāmya
<div n="lb">horses were yoked to his chariot; when asked
<div n="lb">by the king about those horses, the charioteer
<div n="lb">told him that the two horses ran with the speed
<div n="lb">of mind ({%manojavau%}); the king approached
<div n="lb">Vāmadeva and requested him to give the two
<div n="lb">horses to pursue the deer; Vāmadeva agreed
<div n="lb">on condition that the horses be returned
<div n="lb">without delay when the king's purpose was
<div n="lb">served; the king yoked the horses to his
<div n="lb">chariot, caught the deer, but did not return
<div n="lb">the horses to Vāmadeva thinking that such
<div n="lb">‘jewels among horses’ should not be in the
<div n="lb">possession of the Brāhmaṇas ({%aśvaratnāv%}
<div n="lb">{%imāv ayogyau brāhmaṇānām%} 3. 190. 52);
<div n="lb">Vāmadeva, after waiting for a month, sent
<div n="lb">his pupil to ask the king to return the
<div n="lb">Vāmyas; the king refused to part with them
<div n="lb">saying that the Brāhmaṇas did not need horses
<div n="lb">({%kiṃ ca brāhmaṇānām aśvaih kāryam%} 3.
<div n="lb">190. 57); Vāmadeva himself approached the
<div n="lb">king and asked him to return the horses or
<div n="lb">else he would be struck by Varuṇa with his
<div n="lb">nooses; the king told Vāmadeva that draught
<div n="lb">oxen were suitable for Brāhmaṇas and
<div n="lb">that the two Vāmyas belonged to him as a
<div n="lb">Kṣatriya; the king refused to hand over the
<div n="lb">Vāmyas even when the Rākṣasas, the evil
<div n="lb">spirits ({%yātuāhāna%}) created by Vāma-
<div n="lb">deva's curse, struck the king with their
<div n="lb">spikes and brought him down; Dala, the
<div n="lb">brother of Śala, who was next appointed king
<div n="lb">returned the Vāmya horses to Vāmadeva
[Page053-a+ 38]
<div n="lb">after his two attempts to kill Vāmadeva were
<div n="lb">foiled by the sage (3. 190. 44-82).
