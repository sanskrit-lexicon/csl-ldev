the earth, was reported to Yudhiṣṭhira, he,
noticing that the day was the twelfth of the
(bright) fortnight of the month of Māgha
and that the constellation (viz. Puṣya) was
favourable, he asked Bhīma to make prepa-
rations for the horse sacrifice ({%etasminn eva%}

(b) {%dāna:%} One who offered sesame to Brāh-
maṇas in Māgha did not go to hell 13. 65. 7;

{%śaiśiraḥ kālaḥ%} 6. 113. 7) in the month of

of Arjuna and not of Śikhaṇḍin ({%kṛntanti%}
