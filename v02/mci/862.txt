{@Kali@}¦ m., {@Kaliyuga@} nt.: Name of one
of the four Yugas or ages; also called {@Puṣya@}
[Page234-b+ 40]
(6. 11. 3-4, 7, 12, 13) and {@Tiṣya@} (is {%kali-%}
{%puraskṛta%} 12. 327. 76; 12. 337. 42; Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 6. 10. 3. (= Cr. Ed. 6. 11. 3
reads {%tiṣyam%} (in place of Cr. Ed. {%puṣyam%})
and explains it as {%kaliyugam%}).
{@A.@} Characterization: Characterized as
{%kṛṣṇayuga%} (12. 337. 44) and {%tāmasayuga%}
(3. 148. 33). {@B.@} Place among the four
Yugas: Fourth and the last Yuga, hence
referred to as the {%caturtha yuga (yugasya%}
{%ca caturthasya rājā bhavati kāraṇam)%}
5. 130. 16; 12. 70. 25, or as {%paścima%}
{%yugakāla%} 3. 189. 13; it comes at the close
of the Dvāpara Yuga ({%saṃkṣepād dvāpa-%}
{%rasyātha tataḥ puṣyaṃ pravartate%}) 6. 11.
4; hence referred to after the Dvāpara as
{%apara yuga%} 12. 259. 32; Hanūmant told
Bhīma that the Kaliyuga will commence
soon (after the Dvāpara) ({%eatat kaliyugaṃ%}
{%nāma acirād yat pravartate%}) 3. 148. 37;
after the Kaliyuga commences again the
Kṛtayuga ({%kṣīṇe kaliyuge caiva pravartati%}
{%kṛtaṃ yugam%}) 3. 186. 22. {@C.@} Duration:
Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the Kali
Yuga lasts for 1000 years; it is preceded by
dawns of 100 years and followed by evenings
of equal duration ({%sahasram ekaṃ varṣāṇāṃ%}
{%tataḥ kaliyugaṃ smṛtam/tasya varṣaśataṃ%}
{%saṃdhyā saṃdhyāṃśaś ca tataḥ param/%}
{%saṃdhyāsaṃdhyāṃśayos tulyaṃ pramāṇam%}
{%upadhāraya%}) 3. 186. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
3. 188. 23: {%sandhyā pūrvasmin yuge uttara-%}
{%yugadharmāṇām upasarjanatayā saṃkra-%}
{%maḥ/sandhyāṃśas tūttarasmin pūrvayuga-%}
{%dharmāṇām%}); the same duration for Kaliyuga
was narrated by Vyāsa to Śuka 12. 224. 20.
{@D.@} Events marking the advent of the Kali
Yuga: (1) The armies of the Kurus and the
Pāṇḍavas fought each other near the Samanta-
pañcaka at the junction of the Dvāpara
[Page235-a+ 40]
and the Kali Yuga ({%antare caiva saṃ-%}
{%prāpte kalidvāparayor abhūt/samanta-%}
{%pañcake yuddhaṃ kurupāṇḍavasenayoḥ%})
1. 2. 9; (2) Nārāyaṇa told Apāntaratamas
that when the Tiṣyayuga will have set in the
kings born in the line of Bharata, known as
the Kurus, will be born of him (i. e. of Apān-
taratamas then born as Vyāsa) and that
there will be a feud in the family leading to
mutual destruction (here Tiṣya, i. e. Kali,
is mentioned in place of Dvāpara due to
close proximity ?) ({%punas tiṣye ca saṃprā-%}
{%pte kuravo nāma bhāratāḥ/bhaviṣyanti%}
{%mahātmāno rājānaḥ prathitā bhuvi//teṣāṃ%}
{%tvattaḥ prasūtānāṃ kulabhedo bhaviṣyati/%}
{%parasparavināśārthaṃ%}) 12. 337. 42-43;
(3) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that at the end
of the junction of the Dvāpara and the
Kali age he would appear in Mathurā for
the killing of Kaṃsa ({%dvāparasya kaleś%}
{%caiva saṃdhau paryavasānike/prādurbhā-%}
{%vaḥ kaṃsahetoḥ mathurāyāṃ bhaviṣyati%})
12. 326. 82; (4) at the end of the Dvā-
para and the beginning of the Kali age
Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa), along with Saṃkarṣaṇa,
is sung according to the Sātvata mode of
worship ({%dvāparasya yugasyānte ādau%}
{%kaliyugasya ca/sātvataṃ vidhism āsthāya%}
{%gītaḥ saṃkarṣaṇena yaḥ%}) 6. 62. 39. {@E.@}
Kaliyuga and Nārāyaṇa and Vyāsa: (1)
Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in the Kali
Yuga Kṛṣṇa came down to the earth as
{%adharma (kṛṣṇaḥ/kalāv adharmaḥ kṣitim%}
{%ājagāma%} 13. 143. 9; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13.
158. 10: {%kalau tv adharma eva balavān iti%}
{%bhāvaḥ%}); the god (Nārāyaṇa i. e. Kṛṣṇa-
Janārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya
that he has dark colour in the Kaliyuga
({%kṛṣṇaḥ kaliyuge tathā%}) 3. 187. 31;
{%tāmasaṃ yugam āsādya kṛṣṇo bhavati%}
[Page235-b+ 40]
{%keśavaḥ%}) 3. 148. 33; (2) Hari-Nārāyaṇa
told Apāntaratamas (12. 337. 38) that when
Kṛṣṇayuga (i. e. Kaliyuga) sets in he (as
Vyāsa) will have dark colour ({%kṛṣṇe yuge%}
{%ca saṃprāpte kṛṣṇavarṇo bhaviṣyasi%}) 12.
337. 44. {@F.@} King and the Kali Yuga:
All the Yugas are dependent on the king's
behaviour, hence a king is called a {%yuga%}
{%(rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva yugam ucyate)%}
12. 92. 6; according to Bhīṣma all the
Yugas, including Kali, are rooted in a king
({%rājamūlāni sarvāṇi%}) 12. 139. 10; it is the
king who makes the Yugas what they are and
hence he is also the cause of the fourth Yuga
(i. e. the Kaliyuga) ({%yugasya ca caturtha-%}
{%sya rājā bhavati kāraṇam%}) 5. 130. 16; 12.
70. 25; by bringing about the Kali age the
king incurs immense sin ({%kaleḥ pravartanād%}
{%rājā pāpam atyantam aśnute%}) 12. 70. 27;
by bringing about the Kaliyuga (not directly
stated) the evil-doer (i. e. the king) lives
eternally in the hell ({%tato vasati duṣkarmā%}
{%narake śāśvatīḥ samāḥ%}) 5. 130. 18; when
the king wholly gives up {%daṇḍanīti%} and
oppresses his subjects unjustly the Kali age
makes its appearance ({%daṇḍanītiṃ paritya-%}
{%jya yadā kārtsnyena bhūmipaḥ/prajāḥ%}
{%kliśnāty ayogena praviśyati tadā kaliḥ%})
12. 70. 18; where the sinful ones move about
freely among the righteous, there the Kali
age (? or the evil spirit ?) meets the kings
({%? yatra pāpā jñāyamānāś caranti satāṃ%}
{%kalir vindati tatra rājñāḥ%}) 12. 92. 27
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 91. 28: {%rājñaḥ%}
{%nṛpān%}). {@G.@} Kali Yuga and {%dharma:%}
While describing the four Yugas Hanūmant
told Bhīma that in the Kali Yuga {%dharma%}
stands only on one foot ({%pādenaikena%}
{%kaunteya dharmaḥ kaliyuge sthitaḥ%}) 3.
148. 32; ({%pādena tv apare%} (i. e. {%kalau%})
[Page236-a+ 40]
{%yuge%}) 12. 259. 32; ({%tatas tiṣye 'tha saṃ-%}
{%prāpte yuge kalipuraskṛte/ekapāda-%}
{%sthito dharmo yatra tatra bhaviṣyati%}) 12.
327. 76 (however, commentator Vādirāja:
{%tiṣye puṣyanakṣatre,%} note on this stanza in
the Cr. Ed.); 12. 224. 23; gods asked
Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa what they should do
when the {%dharma%} in the Tiṣya Yuga stood
on one foot 12. 327. 77; in the Kali Yuga
(not directly mentioned) {%adharma%} rules
over men in three parts while {%dharma%} attends
men only in one part ({%tribhir aṃśair%}
{%adharmas tu lokān ākramya tiṣṭhati/catur-%}
{%thāṃśena dharmas tu manuṣyān upati-%}
{%ṣṭhati%}) 3. 188. 12; in the Kali Yuga {%dharma%}
is reduced to its sixteenth {%kolā%} on account
of the misbehaviour of kings ({%tathā kaliyuge%}
{%prāpte rājñāṃ duścaritena ha/bhavet%}
{%kālaviśeṣṇa kalā dharmasya ṣoḍaśī%}) 12.
259. 33. {@H.@} Nature of the Kali Yuga
and its effects on men: Vedic practices dwin-
dle, so also the religious and the sacrificial
rites; on the other hand, seasonal calamities,
diseases, lassitude, vices like anger and
others, calamities and mental agonies are ex-
perienced ({%vedācārāḥ praśāmyanti dharma-%}
{%yajñakriyās tathā//ītayo vyādhayas%}
{%tandrī doṣāḥ krodhādayas tathā/upadravāś%}
{%ca vartante ādhayo vyādhayas tathā//%} 3.
148. 33-34; also cf. 3. 186. 24-55; 3. 188.
5-6, 13-84; 12. 224. 62; in the Kali Yuga
the Vedas are seen (i. e. practised) by some
and not by others; they, which alone serve as
dams of {%dharma,%} fall into ruin along with
the sacrifices ({%dṛśyante nāpi dṛśyante vedāḥ%}
{%kaliyuge 'khilāḥ/utsīdante sayajñāś ca%}
{%kevalā dharmasetavaḥ//%}) 12. 224. 66; 12.
230. 15-17; the study of the Vedas dwindles
gradually in each succeeding Yuga ({%veda-%}
{%vādāś cānuyugaṃ hrasantīti ca naḥ śrutam%})
[Page236-b+ 40]
12. 224. 25; the {%adharma%} in the Yugas
other than the Kṛta is on increase due to the
practice of theft, falsehood and deceipt 12.
224. 23; the duties ({%dharmāḥ%}) to be followed
in the Kali Yuga are different (from those of
the other Yugas); they have been prescribed
as if keeping in mind the (lowered) capacity
of men in that age ({%anye kaliyuge dharmā%}
{%yathāśaktikṛtā iva%}) 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8;
giving gifts is specially recommended for the
Kali Yuga ({%dānam eva kalau yuge%}) 12.
224. 27; in the Kali age {%adharma%} is practised
by many, and {%dharma%} only by a few; all
the Varṇas are disinclined to follow {%dharma%}
proper to them 12. 70. 19; also 20-24; the
nature of men in the Puṣyayuga is describ-
ed also in 6. 11. 12-13; strict adherence
to {%dharma%} is not to be expected in the Kali
Yuga-this is what Kṛṣṇa implied in his
words addressed to Balarāma to assuage his
wrath ({%prāptaṃ kaliyugaṃ viddhi%}) 9. 59.
21; in the Kali age (as in the Dvāpara) it
is necessary for people to he paired to beget
children ({%dvāpare maithuno dharmaḥ prajā-%}
{%nām abhavan nṛpa/tathā kaliyuge rājan%}
{%dvandvam āpedire janāḥ//%}) 12. 200. 37;
the ascetics born in the Kali age (as also in
the Tretā and the Dvāpara) are beset with
doubts ({%tretāyāṃ dvāpare caiva kalijāś ca%}
{%sasaṃśayāḥ/tapasvinaḥ%}) 12. 230. 7; evil
tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas and
others which originate in the south ({%dakṣiṇā-%}
{%pathajanmānaḥ%}) and those like the Yaunas,
the Kāmbojas, and other which have their
origin in the north ({%uttarāpathajanmānaḥ%})
roam on the earth in the Tretā and the follow-
ing Yugas (i. e. also in the Kali) ({%tretā-%}
{%prabhṛti vartante te janā bharatarṣabha%})
12. 200. 39-42; Dyumatsena told Satyavān
that if the Dasyus were not killed then
[Page237-a+ 40]
in the Kaliyuga people would say to each
other: “this is mine, not his”, it would
then be difficult to carry on every day life
({%mamedam iti nāsyaitat pravarteta kalau%}
{%yuge/lokayātrā na caiva syāt%}) 12. 259. 6; if
one always recites the description of the origin
of cows he is freed of the impurity of the Kali
age (? or of evil spirit ?) ({%imaṃ gavāṃ pra-%}
{%bhavavidhānam uttamaṃ paṭhan sadā … %}
{%vimucyate kalikaluṣeṇa mānavaḥ%}) 13. 76. 32.
{@I.@} Span of life: In the Puṣya (i. e. the Kali)
Yuga there is no fixed span of life; people die
(even) in the womb or immediately after
they are born ({%na pramāṇasthitir hy asti%}
{%puṣye 'smin bharatarṣabha garbhasthāś ca%}
{%mriyante 'tra tathā jātā mriyanti ca//%})
6. 11. 7; the life-span, as also other faculties,
of human beings decrease successively in
each following Yuga ({%āyur vīryam … /%}
{%manusyāṇām anuyugaṃ hrasatīti nibodha%}
{%me//%}) 3. 188. 13; however, life is expected
to be of a hundred years ({% … tretādiṣv ete-%}
{%sāṃ pādaśo hrasate vayaḥ%}) 12. 224. 24, 25.
{@J.@} Kali as a name of Sūrya: Kali occurs
among the 108 names of Sūrya taught by
Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 20: {%kaliḥ sarvamalāśraya%}
{%ity ekaṃ nāma%}).
