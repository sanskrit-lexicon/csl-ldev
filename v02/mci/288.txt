{@Lomaśa@}¦ m.: A cat.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Residence: He lived on the branches
<div n="lb">of a banyan tree in a certain forest 12. 136. 19,
<div n="lb">22; also in a hole ({%svabilam%}) at the foot of
<div n="lb">the tree 12. 136. 190. {@B.@} Description: Had
<div n="lb">sharp front teeth and eyes resembling the
<div n="lb">cat's-eye gem; he was intelligent, eloquent
<div n="lb">({%vākyasaṃpanna%}) and knew the import of
<div n="lb">speech {%vākyatattvajña%}) 12. 136. 65, 64, 94.
<div n="lb">{@C.@} Palita-Lomaśa Episode: A mouse,
<div n="lb">Palita, also lived in a hole at the foot of the
<div n="lb">banyan tree; Lomaśa, although normally
<div n="lb">watchful ({%apramatta%} 12. 136. 25), was once
<div n="lb">caught in a trap ({%unmātha%} 12. 136. 23) fixed
<div n="lb">by a Cāṇḍāla; when this happened Palita
<div n="lb">began to move about freely, got a piece of
<div n="lb">flesh, and started eating it on the top of the
<div n="lb">trap while smiling inwardly at the cat caught
<div n="lb">in the trap below; just then the mouse
<div n="lb">Palita saw his two other enemies, an
<div n="lb">ichneumon on the ground and an owl on the
<div n="lb">tree, wanting to get him; Palita immediately
<div n="lb">realized that the cat, his third enemy in
<div n="lb">distress, was his only means of escape; he
<div n="lb">therefore offered the cat to cut off the cords
[Page050-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">of the net if the cat in return promised not
<div n="lb">to injure him when he moved near the cat
<div n="lb">to protect himself from the ichneumon and
<div n="lb">the owl; Palita wished that Lomaśa remained
<div n="lb">alive and expected a similar response from
<div n="lb">Lomaśa ({%tava jīvitam icchāmi tvaṃ mame-%}
<div n="lb">{%cchasi jīvitam%} 12. 136. 59); the cat too
<div n="lb">knew that be by himself was almost at
<div n="lb">the end of his life ({%tām avasthām avek-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṣyāntyām%} 12. 136. 64) and hence spoke in
<div n="lb">conciliatory terms to the mouse; Lomaśa
<div n="lb">told the mouse that he had given up his
<div n="lb">pride and that he was Palita's devotee and
<div n="lb">pupil; he was prepared to carry out Palita's
<div n="lb">order and work in his interest; he requested
<div n="lb">Palita to do what would serve the purpose
<div n="lb">of both of them; Palita then suggested the
<div n="lb">following plan to Lomaśa: the mouse was
<div n="lb">to go very close to the cat and while he
<div n="lb">was in that condition the cat was to protect
<div n="lb">the mouse from the owl and the ichneumon;
<div n="lb">when the danger to the mouse from the two
<div n="lb">had passed, the mouse was to cut the cords of
<div n="lb">the net and free the cat; Lomaśa agreed to
<div n="lb">this plan and promised not only to be well-
<div n="lb">disposed towards Palita when he drew near, but
<div n="lb">also offered later to do, with his friends and
<div n="lb">relatives, things pleasing to Palita; the mouse
<div n="lb">then moved very close to the cat and slept on
<div n="lb">his chest; having seen that the ichneumon and
<div n="lb">the owl had returned to their respective homes
<div n="lb">Palita started to cut off the cords of the net
<div n="lb">slowly; Lomaśa tried to hasten him asking
<div n="lb">him not to be ungrateful; Lomaśa wanted
<div n="lb">Palita to finish the work before the Caṇḍāla
<div n="lb">({%śvapaca%}) returned; Palita refused to hasten
<div n="lb">until he was sure that the Caṇḍāla was close
<div n="lb">by so that Lomaśa, when freed, would not
<div n="lb">pounce on the mouse but jump on the tree
<div n="lb">from the fear of the Caṇḍāla; Lomaśa again
<div n="lb">pleaded with Palita to be more quick in his
[Page051-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">work pointing out that good men did not
<div n="lb">act the way Palita was going about his
<div n="lb">work; Palita should not remember their
<div n="lb">past enmity and delay in freeing the cat;
<div n="lb">Palita assured Lomaśa that he had cut off
<div n="lb">most of the cords and deliberately left only
<div n="lb">one which he would bite off at the proper
<div n="lb">time; when the night ended and the Caṇḍāla
<div n="lb">was seen arriving, Lomaśa was frightened and
<div n="lb">asked Palita what he intended to do; Palita
<div n="lb">cut off the last cord and the freed Lomaśa
<div n="lb">jumped up the tree as was expected by Palita,
<div n="lb">and Palita himself entered his hole; when the
<div n="lb">disappointed Caṇḍāla went away, Lomaśa
<div n="lb">requested Palita not to misunderstand him if
<div n="lb">he, when he became free, jumped up the
<div n="lb">tree without conversing with Palita ({%akṛtvā%}
<div n="lb">{%saṃvidaṃ kāṃcit sahasāham upaplutaḥ/%}
<div n="lb">{%kṛtajñaṃ kṛtakalyāṇaṃ kaccin māṃ nābhi-%}
<div n="lb">{%śaṅkase%} 12. 136. 119); Lomaśa asked the
<div n="lb">mouse to trust him and come close to him as
<div n="lb">he wanted to honour Palita who had saved
<div n="lb">him; Lomaśa asked Palita to be his minister
<div n="lb">and instruct him like a father ({%amātyo me%}
<div n="lb">{%bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi mām%} 12.
<div n="lb">136. 126); the counsel ({%mantra%}) of the mouse
<div n="lb">and the strength ({%bala%}) of the cat together
<div n="lb">would win victories for them (12. 136. 127);
<div n="lb">but Palita pointed out to Lomaśa that he
<div n="lb">fell into the trap due to his thoughtlessness
<div n="lb">({%capalatvāt%} 12. 136. 142); thoughtlessness
<div n="lb">does not help the person himself, how can it
<div n="lb">help others ?; Palita plainly told the cat that
<div n="lb">he wanted the mouse to move close to him
<div n="lb">because he was the food of the cat; Palita
<div n="lb">refused to go near Lomaśa when that
<div n="lb">was the cat's dinner time; Lomaśa made one
<div n="lb">more plea to Palita describing himself to be
<div n="lb">the knower of duties ({%dharmajña%}), apprecia-
<div n="lb">tive of the merits of others ({%guṇajña%}), grate-
<div n="lb">ful for the good act ({%kṛtajña%}), and fond of
[Page051-b+ 38]
<div n="lb">friends ({%mitreṣu vatsala%} 12. 136. 179); if the
<div n="lb">mouse forsook the cat the latter would die;
<div n="lb">Palita, however, remained firm and advised
<div n="lb">Lomaśa to protect himself from the Caṇḍāla;
<div n="lb">hearing Caṇḍāla's name, the frightened
<div n="lb">Lomaśa quickly entered his hole, and Palita
<div n="lb">entered his 12. 136. 21-191.
