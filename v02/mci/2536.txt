in the form of an {%arbuda%} horses who
could go long distances and were of noble
descent, as well as gold in very large quan-
tities to be counted by crores and totalling

[Page879-a+ 40]
({%mahāgamān dūragamān gaṇitān arbudaṃ%}
{%hayān//koṭiśaś caiva bahuśaḥ suvarṇaṃ%}
{%padmasaṃmitam//balim ādāya vividhaṃ%}
{%dvāri tiṣṭhanti vāritāḥ//%}) 2. 47. 26-27; they
are mentioned a third time along with
Aṅgas, Vaṅgas and others whose kings
({%kṣatriyāḥ%}) brought large amount of wealth
as tribute ({%āhārṣuḥ kṣatriyā vittaṃ śata-%}
{%śaḥ%}); when asked by the gate-keepers to
give more, each one of them gave a thou-
sand elephants from the Kāmyaka lake and
then were allowed to enter; the elephants
given by them are described in stanzas 2.
48. 15-20; Kṛṣṇa mentioned Śakas among
those whose kings, afraid of the lustre of
the weapons of Pāṇḍavas, acted as servers
at the Rājasūya sacrifice ({%śakān/ … mahī-%}
{%pālān śastratejobhayārditān/ … yajñe%}
{%te pariveṣakān%}) 3. 48. 18, 20, 22; (2)
Drupada asked Yudhiṣṭhira to send his
messengers to the kings of Śakas and others
to seek their help in war 5. 4. 7, 9, 15; (3)
Kāmboja Sudakṣiṇa came to Duryodhana
with an army of {%akṣauhiṇī%} fighters consi-
sting of Yavanas and Śakas; it looked like
a swarm of locusts ({%tasya senāsamāvāyaḥ%}
{%śalabhānām ivābabhau%}) 5. 19. 21-22;
Duryodhana's army consisted of different
peoples, Śakas being one of them; like the
army of gods it was difficult to be attacked
({%durādharṣāṃ devacamūprakāśām%}) 5. 158.
19-20; Śaka kings with their armies led
by Śakuni marched towards Kurukṣetra
in the second division of the Kaurava army
({%śakāḥ … dvitīye niryayur bale%}) 5. 196. 7;
there, on the battle-field, before the start of
the war, Kṛpa along with Śakas, Kirātas
and others protected the Kaurava army in
the north ({%camūm uttarato 'bhipāti%}) 6.
20. 13; (4) On the third day of the war,
[Page879-b+ 40]
the Kāmboja king along with the Śakas
was posted at the ‘tail’ ({%puccham āsan%}) of
the Garuḍavyūha (6. 52. 2) of Kauravas
6. 52. 7; (5) On the sixth day, Śakas,
Yavanas and others stood at the right wing
({%dakṣiṇam pakṣam āśritya%}) of the Krauñca-
vyūha (6. 71. 14) of the Kauravas 6. 71. 20;
(6) On the eleventh day, Śakas, Yavanas
and others riding swift horses stood at
the extreme end of the left wing ({%savyaṃ%}
{%pārśvaṃ … teṣāṃ prapakṣāḥ … yayur aśvair%}
{%mahāvegaiḥ%}) of the Śakaṭavyūha (7. 6. 15)
of Kauravas 7. 6. 4-5; (7) On the eleventh
day, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, while recounting past
exploits of Kṛṣṇa remembered his victory
over hordes of enemies consisting of Āvan-
tyas and others who came from different
directions and joined the Śakas riding
horses (?) ({%āvantyān … nānādigbhyaś ca%}
{%saṃprāptān vrātān aśvaśakān prati/jitavān%}
{%puṇḍarīkākṣo … %}) 7. 10. 16-18 (See Editor's
note on the stanza Vol. IX. pp. 1144-1145:
{%ŚBr. (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa)%} appears to
use this word to signify ‘excrement of a
horse’! Here it seems to mean a particular
(disgusting ?) tribe of Śakas who were
horse-riders (cf. {#अश्वपुरुष#} in 6. 1. 7); (8)
On the twelfth day, Śakas were among
those who occupied the ‘neck’ ({%grīvāyām%})
of the Suparṇavyūha (7. 19. 4) of Kaura-
vas 7. 19. 7-8; (9) On the fourteenth
day, fierce Śakas, Yavanas and others
formed innumerable hordes in hundreds
and thousands ({%vrātāḥ śatasahasraśaḥ%}) to
attack Arjuna; he fought them with arrows
and cut them off with his skill in shooting
arrows ({%aśātayat … astramāyayā%}); afraid,
they all fled 7. 68. 41-45; (10) The same
day, Sātyaki expected to encounter them in
his onward march towards Arjuna ({%śakaiś%}
[Page880-a+ 39]
{%cāpi sameṣyāmi%}) 7. 87. 50; Sātyaki asked
his charioteer to drive his chariot to Śakas
and other Mlecchas who, riding chariots
and elephants and holding different kinds
of weapons in their hands, were eager to
fight with him ({%mām evābhimukhāḥ sarve%}
{%tiṣṭhanti samarārthinaḥ%}); Sātyaki was con-
fident to defeat them 7. 95. 13-14; in the
encounter that followed, Śakas and others
showered arrows on Sātyaki; he cut off
their arrows and killed them by thousands
covering the earth with their blood and
flesh; those who escaped death fled swiftly
in fright; Sātyaki thus defeated the large
army of Śakas 7. 95. 32-33, 38-39, 45;
three thousand horse-riders of Śakas and
others, led by Duryodhana, returned to
the battlefield to attack Sātyaki; he killed
many of them 7. 97. 13-14, 20; (11) On
the seventeenth day, Kāmbojas, Śakas and
Yavanas, led by Saṃśaptakas guarded the
extremity of the left side ({%vāmaṃ pārśvam%}
{%apālayan … teṣāṃ prapakṣaḥ%}) of the Bārha-
spatyavyūha (8. 31. 26) of Kauravas 8. 31.
14-15; in the course of that day, after the
death of the younger brother of Kāmboja
Sudakṣiṇa, there was fierce fighting ({%ghoram%}
{%adbhutadarśanam%}) in which Śakas riding
horses took part; a large number of them
were killed 8. 40. 107-110; later that day,
Kṛṣṇa in order to encourage Arjuna told him
that Śakas had joined the Kaurava army for
the sake of Duryodhana and no one else but
he (Arjuna) could defeat them ({%na śakyā%}
{%yudhi nirjetuṃ tvadanyena paraṃtapa%}) 8.
51. 18, 20; Śakas, who held excellent
weapons in their hands and were ready to
shoot arrows, riding horses, chariots and
elephants, rushed at Arjuna to kill him
[Page880-b+ 39]
({%ātatāyinaḥ/śakās … //varāyudhān pāṇiga-%}
{%tān%}); Arjuna cut off their hands and heads,
killed their horses and elephants and broke
their chariots 8. 64. 16-17; (12) On the
seventeenth day, at night ({%niśi%} 8. 1. 25), when
Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death
of Karṇa, he while remembering the past
heroism of Karṇa mentioned that he had
formerly defeated Śakas and many others
and made them pay tribute ({%cakre balibhṛ-%}
{%taḥ purā%}) 8. 5. 18, 20 (reference to Karṇa's
{%digvijaya%} at the time of Duryodhana's
{%vaiṣṇavayajña%} 3. 241. 19, 32 (Vol. 4. App.
I. 24. 28-34); (13) On the eighteenth
day, Kṛpa with Śakas and Yavanas stood
on the right side ({%dakṣiṇe pārśve%}) of the
Sarvatobhadravyūha (9. 7. 19) of Kaura-
vas 9. 7. 24; (14) At the end of the war,
Saṃjaya mentioned Śakas among those
who were killed in the war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra remembered that Śakas and others
had joined his side not caring for death
while fighting ({%madartham udyatāḥ sarve%}
{%prāṇāṃs tyaktvā raṇe%}); Duryodhana boast-
ed his ability to fight with Pāṇḍavas due to
the support of Śakas 9. 2. 8, 21-22. {@E.@} Past
event: Māndhātṛ once asked Indra how
people like Śakas were to be made to follow
Dharma and how kings like him should
control them ({%kathaṃ dharmaṃ careyus te%}
{% … madvidhaiś ca kathaṃ sthāpyāḥ%}); Indra
thereupon told Māndhātṛ the duties of
Dasyus (the term Dasyu apparently covered
Śakas) 12. 65. 13, 15, 17-21. {@F.@} Future
event: Śakas are mentioned among many
kings who at the end of the Yuga ({%yu-%}
{%gānte samanuprāpte%}) 3. 186. 30; {%yugānte%} 3.
186. 33; {%yugakṣaye%} 3. 186. 43, 48) would
rule the earth the wrong way, would be
[Page881-a+ 39]
sinful and would be given to tell lies ({%mi-%}
{%thyānuśāsinaḥ pāpā mṛṣāvādaparāyaṇāḥ%})
3. 186. 29-30.
