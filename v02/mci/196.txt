<div n="lb">{@A.@} Recidence: Lived in a hole, having
<div n="lb">hundred outlets, at the foot of a banyan
<div n="lb">tree 12. 136. 21. {@B.@} Qualities: He
<div n="lb">was very wise, intelligent, thoughtful, versed
<div n="lb">in scriptures, knew how things shaped them-
<div n="lb">selves, and the proper time for conciliation and

<div n="lb">Uśanas himself in intelligence 12. 136. 127.
<div n="lb">{@C.@} Palita-Lomaśa Episode: Once when
<div n="lb">the cat Lomaśa who lived on the branches
<div n="lb">of the same banyan tree was caught in the
<div n="lb">trap ({%unmātha%}) fixed by a Cāṇḍāla, Palita
<div n="lb">moved about fearlessly; he got a piece of flesh
<div n="lb">and as he was eating it after taking it on
<div n="lb">the top of the trap and smiling mentally
<div n="lb">({%manasā hasan%} 12. 136. 28) at his enemy,
<div n="lb">trapped below, Palita saw his second enemy,
<div n="lb">a mongoose by name Harika, approaching
<div n="lb">the tree and looking up at his prey; Palita
<div n="lb">at that moment, also saw a third enemy, an
<div n="lb">owl named Candraka, prowling from his
[Page038-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">nest situated on the branch of the same tree;
<div n="lb">apprehending danger from both directions,
<div n="lb">Palita decided to take help from the cat, his
<div n="lb">foe in distress, and find escape from all the
<div n="lb">three 12. 136. 26-42; he therefore addressed
<div n="lb">himself to the cat pointing out that there was
<div n="lb">danger to the life of both of them, that both
<div n="lb">lived on the same tree and therefore deserved
<div n="lb">to be friends of each other on the basis of
<div n="lb">common residence ({%savāso me 'si paṇḍitaḥ%}
<div n="lb">{%vl. paṇḍita%} 12. 136. 54), that he was prepared
<div n="lb">to cut the cords that bound the cat provided
<div n="lb">the cat agreed not to kill him when freed;
<div n="lb">Palita appealed to the cat: “I wish you live,
<div n="lb">and you should wish that I live” 12. 136.
<div n="lb">48-62; the cat agreed to the proposal and
<div n="lb">asked Palita to do what was suited to the
<div n="lb">occasion; Palita swore by truth ({%satyena te%}
<div n="lb">{%śape%} 12. 136. 73) to cut down the net pro-
<div n="lb">vided the cat agreed not to kill him when he
<div n="lb">descended and crawled very close to the body
<div n="lb">of the cat ({%ahaṃ tvānupravekṣyāmi%} 12.
<div n="lb">136. 72); when the cat agreed to this, Palita
<div n="lb">went near the cat and rested quietly on his
<div n="lb">chest; seeing him safe, the mongoose and the
<div n="lb">owl returned to their residence 12. 136. 66-82;
<div n="lb">Palita then started to cut slowly the cords of
<div n="lb">the net; when the cat asked Palita to finish
<div n="lb">the work quickly, Palita advised him to be
<div n="lb">patient; Palita would complete cutting the
<div n="lb">net only when he saw the Caṇḍāla, who had
<div n="lb">spread the net, approach; otherwise the cat
<div n="lb">might prove dangerous to him; if the cat,
<div n="lb">when freed, saw the Caṇḍāla drawing near
<div n="lb">he would immediately mount the tree and
<div n="lb">not waste his time in jumping on the mouse;
<div n="lb">Palita then could safely enter his hole 12. 136.
<div n="lb">83-93; when the cat persisted in asking
<div n="lb">Palita to make haste, Palita replied as
<div n="lb">follows: “I have made treaty with one who
<div n="lb">is stronger than me, I have therefore to protect
[Page038-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">myself; no one has any regard for the doer of
<div n="lb">a good act, once the act has been fully done;
<div n="lb">hence all good acts must be done with a part
<div n="lb">left unfinished ({%na hi kaś cit kṛte kārye%}
<div n="lb">{%kartāraṃ samavekṣate/tasmāt sarvāṇi%}
<div n="lb">{%kāryāṇi sāvaśeṣāṇi kārayet%} 12. 136. 105);
<div n="lb">now only one cord remains; I shall cut down
<div n="lb">that too at proper time” 12. 136. 100-107;
<div n="lb">at dawn when the Caṇḍāla Parigha appeared,
<div n="lb">true to his word, Palita cut off the last cord;
<div n="lb">the freed cat, as expected by Palita, jumped up
<div n="lb">the tree and Palita entered the hole 12. 136.
<div n="lb">109-116; when the Caṇḍāla left the scene, the
<div n="lb">cat asked Palita to come out of the hole and
<div n="lb">move freely among the cats without appre-
<div n="lb">hending any danger; he asked Palita to become
<div n="lb">his minister and even guide him like his father
<div n="lb">({%amātyo me bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi%}
<div n="lb">{%mām%}) 12. 136. 119-126; but Palita refused to
<div n="lb">oblige; he told the cat that there were no natu-
<div n="lb">ral friends and no natural foes; hence there
<div n="lb">were no permanent friendships and no perma-
<div n="lb">nent enmities; friendships and enmities arise
<div n="lb">due to certain common or conflicting interests
<div n="lb">({%nāsti jātyā rīpur nāma mitraṃ nāma na%}
<div n="lb">{%vidyate/sāmarthyayogāj jāyante mitrāṇi%}
<div n="lb">{%ripavas tathā//nāsti maitrī sthirā nāma%}
<div n="lb">{%na ca dhruvam asauhṛdam/arthayuktyā%}
<div n="lb">{%hi jāyante mitrāṇi ripavas tathā//%} 12. 136.
<div n="lb">132, 134); danger arising out of misplaced
<div n="lb">trust cuts at the very roots; the affection bet-
<div n="lb">ween them arose for some purpose; once that
<div n="lb">purpose was served, friendship lost its ground;
<div n="lb">mouse was food, and cat the eater; mouse was
<div n="lb">weak cat strong; there could be no real
<div n="lb">conciliation ({%sandhi%}) among parties of uneven
<div n="lb">strength; Palita said he knew that it was the
<div n="lb">cat's food time; that was the reason why the
<div n="lb">cat was asking Palita to stir out; Palita finally
<div n="lb">told the cat that if he remembered Palita's
<div n="lb">good act let him wish well of the mouse ({%śivaṃ%}
[Page039-a+ 39]
<div n="lb">{%dhyāyasva me 'trasthaḥ sukṛtaṃ smaryate%}
<div n="lb">{%yadi%}) 12. 136. 160-166; the cat made one
<div n="lb">more attempt to win the confidence of Palita
<div n="lb">and praised him 12. 136. 177-182; Palita did
<div n="lb">not relent; he recited two {%gāthās%} of Uśanas
<div n="lb">(apparently 12. 136. 185-186) for the benefit
<div n="lb">of the cat the purport of which was that if one
<div n="lb">made conciliation ({%sandhi%}) with a person
<div n="lb">stronger than himself to face a common enemy
<div n="lb">he should not repose trust in his partner after
<div n="lb">the purpose was served and that in all condi-
<div n="lb">tions one should protect one's life since wealth
<div n="lb">and children could be acquired if one remained
<div n="lb">alive; Palita concluded that the sum and
<div n="lb">substance of the {%nītiśāstras%} was that distrust
<div n="lb">was the best policy ({%saṅkṣepo nītiśāstrāṇām%}
<div n="lb">{%aviśvāsaḥ paro mataḥ%} 12. 136. 187); Palita
<div n="lb">finally told the cat that the mouse must protect
<div n="lb">himself from the cat as the cat must protect
<div n="lb">himself from the Caṇḍāla; the cat, apparently
<div n="lb">scared at hearing the word ‘Caṇḍāla’, ran
<div n="lb">to his hole and Palita entered another hole;
<div n="lb">thus the intelligent Palita, all by himself,
<div n="lb">outwitted his many stronger enemies 12. 136.
<div n="lb">182-192.
