{@Vasuhomasya matam:@}¦ Name (?) of a
tract occurring in the Śāntiparvan 12. 122. 54.
<div n="P">In this tract (12. 122) Vasuhoma, the
king of the Aṅgas, told his royal guest Mān-
dhātṛ the origin of {%daṇḍa,%}—how Mahādeva
created it to put an end to promiscuous be-
haviour of the people ({%saṃkaro na bhaved%}
{%atra tathā vai tad vidhīyatām%} 12. 122. 23);
Mahādeva having created it gave it to Viṣṇu,
from whom it passed on successively to Manu
and his sons; when people remain awake in
this world (i. e. are not negligent about their
duties), it means that the {%daṇḍa%} is awake
in them ({%prajā jāgrati loke 'smin daṇḍo%}
{%jāgrati tāsu ca%}) 12. 122. 50; the king who
listens to this tract and behaves properly will
get all his desires 12. 122. 54.
