{@Āraṭṭa, Bāhlī̆ka@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a
country and its people; also referred to as
{@Pañcanada@} (8. 30. 62, 65-66, 74), {@Āraṭṭaka@}
(8. 30. 74), {@Bāhlī̆@} (2. 47. 22; 5. 84. 6; 13.
[Page626-a+ 40]
106. 16), {@Jartika@} (8. 30. 14); perhaps also
as {@Bāhyālaya@} (? 8. 30. 61).
{@A.@} Name: Āraṭṭa ({%āraṭṭā nāma te%}
{%deśāḥ%}) 8. 30. 36; ({%āraṭṭajān%}) 6. 81. 31;
Bāhlīka ({%bāhlīkadeśam%}) 8. 30. 9; Bāhli
({%bāhlijātānām%} 13. 106. 16; {%bāhlijātaiḥ%} 5. 84.
6); Āraṭṭa and Bāhlīka identified ({%āraṭṭā%}
{%nāma bāhlīkāḥ%}) 8. 30. 40, 43; as people,
the two are enumerated separately ({%āraṭṭa-%}

132. 24; 7. 165. 79; once they are distin-
guished-Āraṭṭa as the name of the country,
Bāhlīka, as the name of the people ({%āraṭṭā%}
{%nāma te deśā bahlīkā nāma te janāḥ%}) 8.
30. 47; for Bāhlīka as name of the people,
cf. Śalya is called {%bāhlīkapuṃgavaḥ%} 1. 61. 6;
Somadatta as {%bāhlikānāṃ ṛṣabhaḥ%} 5. 30. 19;
but the people are also called Āraṭṭaka 8.
30. 74, or simply Āraṭṭa 6. 71. 16, Āraṭṭā
(f.) 8. 30. 58; name Bāhlī̆ for Bāhlīka,
probably due to metrical reasons 2. 47. 22;
13. 106. 16; since the country was marked
by five rivers (see Section {@C.@} Location
below), it was also known as Pañcanada
8. 30. 62, 74; ({%dharmaṃ pāñcanadam%}) 8.
30. 65-66; name Bāhyālaya is doubtful;
the text reads {%prāyo bāhyā layād ṛte%} (8. 30.
61) (Arjunamiśra explains {%prāyo bāhyā%}
{%yathoktapradeśabahirbhūtāḥ/layāt madra-%}
{%deśāt,%} see Cr. Ed. Vol. 10, p. 267, Cr. App.
for 8. 30. 61); perhaps the text is to be
read as {%bāhyālayād ṛte%} 'except those who
have their residence outside (the countries
Kurus, Pāñcālas etc. just mentioned before);
also cf. Editor's note on the stanza Cr. Ed.
Vol. 10. p. 687). {@B.@} Explanation of the
name: A certain Brāhmaṇa had informed
the Kuru assembly that there were two
Piśācas named Bahi and Hlīka living on
the river Vipāśā; Bāhlikas were their
[Page626-b+ 40]
progeny; they were not Prajāpati's creation

41, 44; (of the two Piśācas, Bahi was
female, Hlīka, male, see Cr. Ed. Vol. 10 p.

jaya among the northern Janapadas of the
Bhāratavarṣa ({%ata ūrdhvaṃ janapadān%}

them in his expedition to the north of Indra-

Āraṭṭa-Bāhlīka country was watered by
five rivers viz. Śatadru, Vipāśā, Irāvatī,
Candrabhāgā, and Vitastā with Sindhu as

Its river and forests: The name of the river
flowing through the capital was Āpagā

Bāhlīka country people changed their castes,
i. e. a Brāhmaṇa became first a Kṣatriya,
then Vaiśya, Sūdra and barber, and again
a Brāhmaṇa; having become a Brāhmaṇa
he again became a Dāsa; in a family there
was one Brāhmaṇa, the rest behaved
as it pleased them; thus in the Bāhlīka
