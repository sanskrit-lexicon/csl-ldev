{@Uttarāyaṇa@}¦ nt.: Name of the period in
<div n="lb">which the sun moves to the north, the summer
<div n="lb">solstice; also called {@Udagā̆yana@} ({%-ā- m. c.%})
<div n="lb">(6. 114. 98; 12. 224. 16).
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Sun's courses fixed by Brahman:
<div n="lb">Śakra told Bali that the self-born god (Sva-
<div n="lb">yaṃbhū) had fixed the movements of the
<div n="lb">sun following which the sun moved towards
<div n="lb">the north for six months and towards the
<div n="lb">south for six months 12. 218. 35-36. {@B.@}
<div n="lb">Its duration: The calculators of the divi-
<div n="lb">sions of time say that the year consists of
<div n="lb">two {%ayanas%} (sun's courses), viz. {%dakṣiṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%uttara (saṃvatasaraṃ dve ayane vadanti%}
[Page233-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">{%saṃkhyāvido dakṣiṇam uttaram ca)%} 12.
<div n="lb">224. 13; (12. 47. 42); 13. 16. 46; Nārada
<div n="lb">told Devamata that the two {%ayanas%} ({%dakṣiṇa%}
<div n="lb">and {%uttara%}) form a pair and between them
<div n="lb">is fire; Brāhmaṇas knew that that is the
<div n="lb">highest form of {%udāna (? ubhe caivāyane%}

<div n="lb">{%rūpam udānasya paramaṃ brāhmanā viduḥ)%}
<div n="lb">14. 24. 15; Vyāsa had told Śuka that the night
<div n="lb">and the day of the gods was equal to one
<div n="lb">human year of which the {%uttarāyaṇa%} form-
<div n="lb">ed the day and the {%dakṣiṇāyana%} the night

<div n="lb">{%dakṣiṇāyanam%}) 12. 224. 16. {@C.@} Effects
<div n="lb">on the earth: The sun, during its two
<div n="lb">courses, northern and southern, distributes
<div n="lb">cold and heat among the people ({%ayanaṃ%}

<div n="lb">{%yena saṃyāti lokeṣu śītoṣṇe visṛjan raviḥ//%})
<div n="lb">12. 218. 36; the sun, having traversed its
<div n="lb">northern course and having collected with his
<div n="lb">rays the heated waters, turns for the southern
<div n="lb">course and enters the earth; there, lying in
<div n="lb">the earth and sprinkled with the energies of
<div n="lb">the moon, it produces plants which serve as
<div n="lb">food for living beings ({%gatvottarāyaṇaṃ%}

<div n="lb">{@D.@} Importance: Mahādeva (13. 16. 13)
<div n="lb">identified with both the Uttara and the
<div n="lb">Dakṣiṇa ayana 13. 16. 46. {@E.@} Considered
<div n="lb">holy: The night in the Uttarāyaṇa is con-
<div n="lb">sidered holy and divine; Śacī bowed down
<div n="lb">to this goddess Rātri so that her wish to see
<div n="lb">her husband was fulfilled ({%puṇyāṃ cemām%}

<div n="lb">symbolizes darkness) proceeds Uttarāyaṇa
<div n="lb">(which stands for light); (hence) the gift of

<div n="lb">gifts of light helps the bringing in of the

<div n="lb">{@F.@} Bhīṣma's death in Uttarāyaṇa: Bhīṣma
<div n="lb">when he fell on the ground in the war did not
<div n="lb">give up his life as he wished to wait till the
<div n="lb">setting in of the Uttarāyaṇa 6. 114. 89; he
<div n="lb">assured the sages, sent to him by Gaṅgā, when
<div n="lb">they came to him in the form of swans, that
<div n="lb">he would sustain his life and go to his ori-
<div n="lb">ginal place when the sun had turned towards
<div n="lb">the north 6. 114. 97; he told them that he
<div n="lb">would sustain his life longing for the Uttarā-
<div n="lb">yaṇa; established in complete sway (over his
<div n="lb">life), he could control the act of giving up
<div n="lb">life; he would therefore hold life for some
<div n="lb">time since he wished to die in the Udagāyana
