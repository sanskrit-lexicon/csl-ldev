{@Sumukha<sup>2</sup>@}¦ m.: A mythical bird.
<div n="P">One of the six sons of Vainateya
(Garuḍa), who extended the {%kula%} of
Suparṇas 5. 99. 2; 6. 7. 12; Sumukha saw
that all birds on mount Meru were of gold
({%sauvarṇān prekṣya vāyasān%}); he therefore
felt that mount Meru made no distinction
between good, middling, and low birds and
hence left it 6. 7. 12-13.
