{@Brahmaśiras<sup>1</sup>@}¦ nt.: Name of a missile
(once called {%brahmāstra%} 10. 15. 21).
{@A.@} History: Supposed to have arisen
from Brahman's lustre ({%brahmatejobhava%}
10. 15. 7); Droṇa, after practising severe
austerities, received the missile Brahmaśiras
from Agastya 10. 12. 14; later it was taught
by Droṇa to Arjuna when he was satisfied
({%pritimān, prīyamāṇaḥ%}) with him (Arjuna)
1. 123. 72; 10. 12. 5 and, not with great delight
({%nātihṛṣṭamanāḥ%}), to Aśvatthāman whom he
had apparently first refused to teach 10. 12. 6.
{@B.@} Description: powerful missile ({%para-%}
{%māstra%}) 1. 123. 78; 10. 15. 3, 6; famous as
‘uncomparable’ in the worlds ({%asāmānyam%}
{%idaṃ tāta lokeṣv astraṃ nigadyate%}) 1. 123.
76; divine ({%divya%}) 10. 15. 16; outstanding
({%viśiṣṭa%}) 1. 123. 74; highly irresistible ({%ati-%}
{%durdhara%}) 1. 123. 74; fiery ({%mahārciṣmat%})
10. 14. 7; difficult to obtain ({%duravāpa%}) 10.
15. 9; worshipped by gods and Gandharvas
[Page120-b+ 40]
({%devagandharvapūjita%}) 10. 12. 14; capable of
burning the whole earth ({%dahed yad pṛthivīm%}
{%api%}) 10. 12. 4. {@C.@} Restrictions on its
use: (1) while giving the {%astra%} to Arjuna,
Droṇa told him not to use it against men, but
to use it only if he was attacked in a battle
by a superhuman enemy ({%amānuṣaḥ śatruḥ%});
if released against an enemy of lesser mettle
({%alpatejas%}), the missile would burn the
world 1. 123. 75, 77; (2) while teaching it
to Aśvatthāman, who was known to be rash
by nature, Droṇa warned him not to use it
even under dire circumstances in battle, espe-
cially not against men ({%paramāpadgatenāpi%}
{%na sma tāta tvayā raṇe/idam astraṃ%}
{%prayoktavyaṃ mānuṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ%}) 10. 12.
7-8. {@D.@} Taught by Droṇa only to Arjuna
and Aśvatthāman: (1) It was given to
Arjuna since Droṇa considered him to be dis-
tinguished among his pupils ({%viśiṣṭaṃ sarva-%}
{%śiṣyebhyaḥ%}) 1. 123. 72; 10. 15. 21; when
taught to Arjuna, he would be an unrivalled
archer ({%bhavitā tvatsamo nānyaḥ pumāl̃ loke%}
{%dhanurdharaḥ%}) 1. 123. 78; Droṇa taught
to Arjuna, both its use and withdrawal
({%saprayoganivartanam%}) 1. 123. 74; its with-
drawal very difficult; once released, no one
except Arjuna, not even Indra, was capable of
withdrawing it 10. 15. 5, 6; it could not be with-
drawn by one who had not observed celibacy;
if a non-qualified person tried to withdraw
it, it would cut his head and destroy his
belongings 10. 15. 7-8; Arjuna could with-
draw it as he was truthful, brave, had prac-
tised celibacy, and was obedient to his teacher
10. 15. 10, 20, 24; although fully qualified
to withdraw it, Arjuna never used it in the
epic war nor outside it, even under stress
({%brahmacārī vratī cāpi duravāpam avāpya%}
{%tat/paramavyasanārto 'pi nārjuno 'straṃ%}
[Page121-a+ 40]
{%vyamuñcata%}) 10. 15. 9, ({%brahmāstram apy%}
{%avāpyaitad … kṣatradharmān mahābāhur%}
{%nākampata dhanaṃjayaḥ%}) 10. 15. 21; (2)
Envious of Arjuna, Aśvatthāman asked his
father to teach him Brahmaśiras; Droṇa gave
it to him but not with a pleased mind ({%nāti-%}
{%hṛṣṭamanā iva%}) 10. 12. 6; (since Aśvatthā-
man could not make use of it) he wanted to
exchange it with Kṛṣṇa for his (Sudarśana)
Cakra so that Aśvatthāman could be invin-
cible 10. 12. 15, 36; Kṛṣṇa offered to give
any one of his weapons to Aśvatthāman with-
out receiving from him in return his Brahma-
śiras 10. 12. 18-19; Aśvatthāman chose
the Cakra but failed even so much as to move
it from its place 10. 12. 20-23. {@E.@} Use:
As Aśvatthāman was cruel and rash, there
was every danger of his using Brahmaśiras
against Bhīma, who was chasing him 10. 12.
40; when Aśvatthāman actually used it on an
{%iṣīkā,%} Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to release his
Brahmaśiras to counter it; Arjuna got down
from the chariot with bow and arrow in
hand, wished ‘well’ ({%svasti%} 10. 14. 5; 1. 1.
155) first to Aśvatthāman, then to himself
and to his brothers (the Pāṇḍavas); then
bowing down to deities and teachers, he
released Brahmaśiras, wishing welfare, and
saying ‘may the missile pacify (Aśvatthā-
man's) missile’ ({%utsasarja śivaṃ dhyāyann%}
{%astram astreṇa śāmyatām%}) 10. 14. 4-6; 10.
15. 2, 20; 1. 1. 155; at that time fire broke
out like the fire at the end of the aeon; the fire
of Arjuna's missile matched the fire of Aśvat-
thāman's missile; as a result terror struck the
creatures, skies were filled with great sound
and were engulfed in fire, earth, with its
mountains and trees, shook; the two missiles
produced heat with their lustre 10. 14. 7-11;
just then Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, de-
[Page121-b+ 40]
siring welfare for all the people, appeared and
stood between the two missiles; they pointed
out that Brahmaśiras was never used by any
one before against men 10. 14. 16; in response
to their appeal, Arjuna immediately with-
drew his Brahmaśiras; but Aśvatthāman could
not 10. 15. 1-15; moreover, if Brahmaśiras
was pacified by the other powerful missile
({%paramāstra%}) there would be no rain in the
land for twelve years 10. 15. 23; Aśvatthā-
man then directed his missile towards the
foetus of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 31, 32; 10.
16. 9. [See {@Iṣīkā, Brahmaśiras<sup>2</sup>, Brahmā-@}
