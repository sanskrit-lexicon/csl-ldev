{@Brahmaśiras<sup>1</sup>@}¦ nt.: Name of a missile
<div n="lb">(once called {%brahmāstra%} 10. 15. 21).
<div n="lb">{@A.@} History: Supposed to have arisen
<div n="lb">from Brahman's lustre ({%brahmatejobhava%}
<div n="lb">10. 15. 7); Droṇa, after practising severe
<div n="lb">austerities, received the missile Brahmaśiras
<div n="lb">from Agastya 10. 12. 14; later it was taught
<div n="lb">by Droṇa to Arjuna when he was satisfied
<div n="lb">({%pritimān, prīyamāṇaḥ%}) with him (Arjuna)
<div n="lb">1. 123. 72; 10. 12. 5 and, not with great delight
<div n="lb">({%nātihṛṣṭamanāḥ%}), to Aśvatthāman whom he
<div n="lb">had apparently first refused to teach 10. 12. 6.
<div n="lb">{@B.@} Description: powerful missile ({%para-%}
<div n="lb">{%māstra%}) 1. 123. 78; 10. 15. 3, 6; famous as
<div n="lb">‘uncomparable’ in the worlds ({%asāmānyam%}
<div n="lb">{%idaṃ tāta lokeṣv astraṃ nigadyate%}) 1. 123.
<div n="lb">76; divine ({%divya%}) 10. 15. 16; outstanding
<div n="lb">({%viśiṣṭa%}) 1. 123. 74; highly irresistible ({%ati-%}
<div n="lb">{%durdhara%}) 1. 123. 74; fiery ({%mahārciṣmat%})
<div n="lb">10. 14. 7; difficult to obtain ({%duravāpa%}) 10.
<div n="lb">15. 9; worshipped by gods and Gandharvas
[Page120-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">({%devagandharvapūjita%}) 10. 12. 14; capable of
<div n="lb">burning the whole earth ({%dahed yad pṛthivīm%}
<div n="lb">{%api%}) 10. 12. 4. {@C.@} Restrictions on its
<div n="lb">use: (1) while giving the {%astra%} to Arjuna,
<div n="lb">Droṇa told him not to use it against men, but
<div n="lb">to use it only if he was attacked in a battle
<div n="lb">by a superhuman enemy ({%amānuṣaḥ śatruḥ%});
<div n="lb">if released against an enemy of lesser mettle
<div n="lb">({%alpatejas%}), the missile would burn the
<div n="lb">world 1. 123. 75, 77; (2) while teaching it
<div n="lb">to Aśvatthāman, who was known to be rash
<div n="lb">by nature, Droṇa warned him not to use it
<div n="lb">even under dire circumstances in battle, espe-
<div n="lb">cially not against men ({%paramāpadgatenāpi%}
<div n="lb">{%na sma tāta tvayā raṇe/idam astraṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%prayoktavyaṃ mānuṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ%}) 10. 12.
<div n="lb">7-8. {@D.@} Taught by Droṇa only to Arjuna
<div n="lb">and Aśvatthāman: (1) It was given to
<div n="lb">Arjuna since Droṇa considered him to be dis-
<div n="lb">tinguished among his pupils ({%viśiṣṭaṃ sarva-%}
<div n="lb">{%śiṣyebhyaḥ%}) 1. 123. 72; 10. 15. 21; when
<div n="lb">taught to Arjuna, he would be an unrivalled
<div n="lb">archer ({%bhavitā tvatsamo nānyaḥ pumāl̃ loke%}
<div n="lb">{%dhanurdharaḥ%}) 1. 123. 78; Droṇa taught
<div n="lb">to Arjuna, both its use and withdrawal
<div n="lb">({%saprayoganivartanam%}) 1. 123. 74; its with-
<div n="lb">drawal very difficult; once released, no one
<div n="lb">except Arjuna, not even Indra, was capable of
<div n="lb">withdrawing it 10. 15. 5, 6; it could not be with-
<div n="lb">drawn by one who had not observed celibacy;
<div n="lb">if a non-qualified person tried to withdraw
<div n="lb">it, it would cut his head and destroy his
<div n="lb">belongings 10. 15. 7-8; Arjuna could with-
<div n="lb">draw it as he was truthful, brave, had prac-
<div n="lb">tised celibacy, and was obedient to his teacher
<div n="lb">10. 15. 10, 20, 24; although fully qualified
<div n="lb">to withdraw it, Arjuna never used it in the
<div n="lb">epic war nor outside it, even under stress
<div n="lb">({%brahmacārī vratī cāpi duravāpam avāpya%}

<div n="lb">{%nākampata dhanaṃjayaḥ%}) 10. 15. 21; (2)
<div n="lb">Envious of Arjuna, Aśvatthāman asked his
<div n="lb">father to teach him Brahmaśiras; Droṇa gave
<div n="lb">it to him but not with a pleased mind ({%nāti-%}
<div n="lb">{%hṛṣṭamanā iva%}) 10. 12. 6; (since Aśvatthā-
<div n="lb">man could not make use of it) he wanted to
<div n="lb">exchange it with Kṛṣṇa for his (Sudarśana)
<div n="lb">Cakra so that Aśvatthāman could be invin-
<div n="lb">cible 10. 12. 15, 36; Kṛṣṇa offered to give
<div n="lb">any one of his weapons to Aśvatthāman with-
<div n="lb">out receiving from him in return his Brahma-
<div n="lb">śiras 10. 12. 18-19; Aśvatthāman chose
<div n="lb">the Cakra but failed even so much as to move
<div n="lb">it from its place 10. 12. 20-23. {@E.@} Use:
<div n="lb">As Aśvatthāman was cruel and rash, there
<div n="lb">was every danger of his using Brahmaśiras
<div n="lb">against Bhīma, who was chasing him 10. 12.
<div n="lb">40; when Aśvatthāman actually used it on an
<div n="lb">{%iṣīkā,%} Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to release his
<div n="lb">Brahmaśiras to counter it; Arjuna got down
<div n="lb">from the chariot with bow and arrow in
<div n="lb">hand, wished ‘well’ ({%svasti%} 10. 14. 5; 1. 1.
<div n="lb">155) first to Aśvatthāman, then to himself
<div n="lb">and to his brothers (the Pāṇḍavas); then
<div n="lb">bowing down to deities and teachers, he
<div n="lb">released Brahmaśiras, wishing welfare, and
<div n="lb">saying ‘may the missile pacify (Aśvatthā-
<div n="lb">man's) missile’ ({%utsasarja śivaṃ dhyāyann%}
<div n="lb">{%astram astreṇa śāmyatām%}) 10. 14. 4-6; 10.
<div n="lb">15. 2, 20; 1. 1. 155; at that time fire broke
<div n="lb">out like the fire at the end of the aeon; the fire
<div n="lb">of Arjuna's missile matched the fire of Aśvat-
<div n="lb">thāman's missile; as a result terror struck the
<div n="lb">creatures, skies were filled with great sound
<div n="lb">and were engulfed in fire, earth, with its
<div n="lb">mountains and trees, shook; the two missiles
<div n="lb">produced heat with their lustre 10. 14. 7-11;
<div n="lb">just then Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, de-
[Page121-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">siring welfare for all the people, appeared and
<div n="lb">stood between the two missiles; they pointed
<div n="lb">out that Brahmaśiras was never used by any
<div n="lb">one before against men 10. 14. 16; in response
<div n="lb">to their appeal, Arjuna immediately with-
<div n="lb">drew his Brahmaśiras; but Aśvatthāman could
<div n="lb">not 10. 15. 1-15; moreover, if Brahmaśiras
<div n="lb">was pacified by the other powerful missile
<div n="lb">({%paramāstra%}) there would be no rain in the
<div n="lb">land for twelve years 10. 15. 23; Aśvatthā-
<div n="lb">man then directed his missile towards the
<div n="lb">foetus of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 31, 32; 10.
