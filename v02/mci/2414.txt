{@Bharata, Bhārata@}¦ m. (pl.): General
characterization of the descendants of
Bharata, the son of Duḥṣanta, very often
used to refer to Kauravas, or to Kauravas
and Pāṇḍavas, or to Pāṇḍavas; also used
as an adj. (fem. {%-ī%}) mostly to refer to the
lineage or the army of the Kauravas, occa-
sionally used also to refer to their narrative
and town.
[Page796-a+ 40]
{@A.@} Origin: The family was named
Bhārata after Bharata; his descendants as
well as those who preceded him (?) were
known as Bhāratas; the fame of Bhāratas
was due to Bharata ({%bharatād bhārātī%}

{%ca pūrve ca bhāratā iti viśrutāḥ%}) 1. 69. 49;
1. 89. 16; 13. 75. 26; (1. 1. 44). {@B.@} Line-
age ({%vaṃśa%} or {%kula%}), its importance: Since
the lineage was established by Bharatas
it was known as Bhārata ({%yenedaṃ%}
(i. e. {%bharatena%}) {%bhārataṃ kulam%}) 1. 69.

respected by all kings ({%bhārate vaṃśe%}
{%sarvapārthivapūjite%}) 5. 7. 27. {@C.@} The
narrative of Bhāratas, its importance:
Vaiśaṃpāyana having received it from his
teacher Vyāsa was eager to narrate the
narrative of Bhāratas to Janamejaya, who
was a worthy person to listen to it ({%śrotuṃ%}

{%tīṃ kathām/guror vaktuṃ parispando%}

was told in the {%sarpasatra%} of king Jana-
mejaya ({%katheyam … bhāratānām%}) 1. 2.
74; one who listened to the narration of
the birth of Bhāratas has no fear from
diseases, least of all of the next world; it
was holy, brought wealth, fame, long life
and heaven; it is also large and leads to
bliss ({%bhāratānāṃ mahaj janma śṛṇvatām%}

assembly of Kauravas ({%sarvāṃś ca bharatān%}
{%pṛthak … svajethā madhusūdana%}) 5. 81. 47-

saw many towns and countries happy and
protected by Bhāratas (Kauravas) ({%bhāra-%}
{%tair abhirakṣitāḥ%}) 5. 82. 17; (36) Kṛṣṇa
told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that if the Bharatas

they together would work for him (i. e. for
Dhṛtarāṣṭra) ({%sahabhūtās tu bharatās%}
{%tavaiva syur janeśvara%}) 5. 93. 16; he also
advised Duryodhana to come to terms with

the army of Bhāratas (Kauravas) 6. 108. 6;
according to Droṇa, the wrath of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira was burning Bhāratas (Kauravas) 6.

by the ancient forefathers of Bharatas
({%pitaraś caiva praśaśaṃsur … /bharatānāṃ%}
{%ca ye pūrve%}) 6. 114. 111; with the fall of
Bhīṣma, the army of the Bhāratas (Kaura-
vas) ({%bhāratī … senā%}) was like a boat in
a big ocean, shaken by wind in all dire-
ctions and shattered 7. 1. 27-28; hearing
Bhīṣma's fall Dhṛtarāṣṭra swooned,
surrounded and touched by Bharata women

against Kṣatriyas (Kauravas) which once
before proved beneficial for Bharatas
(Kauravas) fleeing in their fight (with

had set after tormenting the army of
Bhāratas ({%taptvā bhāratavāhinīm%}) 7. 48.

rāṣṭra remembered that he had told Duryo-
dhana that Pāṇḍavas would do what was

magnanimous Bharatas spoke to them
on his behalf ({%bhīṣmasya ca mahātmanaḥ/%}

was in the midst of the army of Bhāratas
(here, the army of the Trigartas cf. 7. 116.

heroes of great prowess ({%yodhitaś ca mahā-%}

attacked by Bhīma's arrows appeared
