{@A.@} History: Formerly a crore of devout
sages sat down in order to see god (Śiva);
they started for this place vying with one

his divine power ({%yogam āsthāya%}) created
a crore of Rudras in front of every one of
them so that every one felt that he saw Rudra
first ({%sṛṣṭā koṭis tu rudrāṇām ṛṣīṇām%}

anger (with the thought that he was behind
others in seeing Rudra) ({%teṣāṃ manyu-%}

merit would increase ({%adyaprabhṛti yuṣmā-%}
