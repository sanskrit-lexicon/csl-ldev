(12) On the seventeenth day, Karṇa
killed many warriors in the army of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira consisting of Niṣādas (on the side
of the Pāṇḍavas) and others; when they
began to run away, Sātyaki incited them
to fight; on return, they were killed by
[Page759-b+ 40]
Karṇa who cut off their arms and removed
their head-gears ({%te vibāhuśirastrāṇāḥ … %}
{%petuḥ pṛthivyāṃ … %}) 8. 33. 1, 4-5; (13)
On the same day, Arjuna referred to
Bhīma's killing Niṣādas (on the side of
the Kauravas) and their elephants ({%nāga-%}
{%varān … sadāmadān nīlabalāhakopamān%}) 8.
49. 78-79; (14) When Arjuna moved
with the Aśvamedha horse, he had to fight
a fierce battle with the Niṣādas led by
Ekalavya's son 14. 84. 7-8. {@H.@} Mythologi-
cal event: Vinatā allowed her son Garuḍa
to eat Niṣādas (but not the Brāhmaṇas)
while on his way to fetch {%amṛta%} 1. 24. 2;
when Garuḍa found the Niṣādas he colle-
cted them together; then, opening his beak
wide, he stood in the way of the Niṣādas;
they entered Garuḍa's mouth by hundreds
since they were deluded by the dust raised
by the wind; the hungry Garuḍa closed
his beak and killed many Niṣādas 1. 24.
10-14. {@I.@} Past events: (1) Sarasvatī
disappeared at the gate of the Niṣādarāṣṭra
so that the Niṣādas might not see her 3.
130. 4; (2) Some Niṣādas once came to
the place where Cyavana was practising
austerities near the confluence of Gaṅgā and
Yamunā; the Niṣādas who wanted to catch
fishes threw their net in water; when they
drew their net they dragged Cyavana along
with fishes; they fell at the feet of Cyavana
and asked him what they should do;
Cyavana told the Niṣadas that he did not
want to forsake the fishes and hence would
get killed or sold along with them; afraid,
the Niṣādas reported the matter to king
Nahuṣa; Nahuṣa asked his priest to pay
one thousand (coins) to the Niṣādas as the
price of fishes and Cyavana; on Cyavana's
denial to accept this price, Nahuṣa went
[Page760-a+ 38]
on bidding higher and higher price to be
paid to Niṣādas; ultimately Cyavana was
purchased by giving a cow to Niṣādas;
they offered it to Cyavana; Cyavana sent
the Niṣādas and the fishes to heaven 13.
