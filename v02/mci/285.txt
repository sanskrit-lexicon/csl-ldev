{@Rājadharman@}¦ m.: A mythical crane
<div n="lb">({%baka%} 12. 167. 10, 15), also called Kāśyapa
<div n="lb">and Naḍījaṅgha.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Birth: Son of Dākṣāyaṇī (referred
<div n="lb">to as {%devakanyā%} 12. 163. 19) and Kaśyapa 12.
<div n="lb">164. 2. {@B.@} Residence ({%bhavana%} 12. 163.
<div n="lb">17; {%nilaya%} 12. 163. 23; {%niveśana%} 12. 166. 10;
<div n="lb">{%gṛha%} 12. 166. 6; {%ālaya%} 12. 167. 14): Under a
<div n="lb">big {%nyagrodha%} tree, on a space covered with
<div n="lb">golden sand, in a forest near the ocean; the
<div n="lb">place was frequented by the {%Yakṣas%} and
<div n="lb">{%Kinnaras;%} the residence looked like the seat
<div n="lb">of Pitāmaha ({%pitāmahasadopamam%}) 12.
<div n="lb">163. 6-7; 11-13. {@C.@} Description: Of pure
<div n="lb">soul ({%viśuddhātman%} 12. 166. 10), noble-
<div n="lb">minded ({%mahātman%} 12. 165. 7; 12. 167. 15),
<div n="lb">magnanimous ({%mahāmanas%} 12. 164. 6), of
<div n="lb">great understanding ({%mahāmati%} 12. 164. 10),
<div n="lb">intelligent ({%dhīmant%} 12. 165. 27), eloquent
<div n="lb">({%vāgmin%} 12. 164. 9). {@D.@} Status: King
<div n="lb">of the cranes ({%bakarāj%} 12. 164. 9; {%bakarāja%}
<div n="lb">12. 166. 2; 12. 167. 2, 5; {%bakapati%} 12. 165.
<div n="lb">31; 12. 167. 1, 8; {%bakādhipa%} 12. 167. 5, 13,
<div n="lb">14; {%bakendra%} 12. 167. 8); best among the
<div n="lb">birds or king of the birds ({%khagottama%} 12.
<div n="lb">165. 26; {%khagendra%} 12. 166. 1); Brahma-
<div n="lb">deva when angered, however, called him
<div n="lb">‘wicked-minded’ ({%duṣṭātman%}) and ‘worst
<div n="lb">among the cranes’ ({%bakādhama%}) 12. 167.
<div n="lb">9. {@E.@} Visits to Brahmaloka: It was
<div n="lb">Rājadharman's practice to go to Brahma-
<div n="lb">loka during the first twilight to pay
<div n="lb">homage to god Brahmadeva 12. 166. 6;
<div n="lb">on his return journey from Brahmaloka
<div n="lb">Rājadharman used to meet his friend the
<div n="lb">Rākṣaka king Virūpākṣa every day 12. 166.
<div n="lb">6. {@F.@} Encounter with the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb">Gautama: Once when Rājadharman
<div n="lb">returned from Brahmaloka in the evening he
<div n="lb">met Gautama who happened to be at his
<div n="lb">residence 12. 163. 17; Rājadharman received
[Page048-b+ 41]
<div n="lb">him as his guest with due rites and offered him
<div n="lb">a seat of {%śāla%} flowers; he also gave him big
<div n="lb">fishes from Ganges and fire (for his protec-
<div n="lb">tion during the night); he fanned Gautama
<div n="lb">with his wings to remove his fatigue and
<div n="lb">then asked Gautama his {%gotra;%} Gautama
<div n="lb">told him only his name and that he was a
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇa but nothing else ({%so 'bravīd%}
<div n="lb">{%gautamo 'smīti brāhma nānyad udāharat%}
<div n="lb">12. 164. 7); Rājadharman offered his guest
<div n="lb">a bed of leaves, rich in fragrance and strewn
<div n="lb">with fragrant, heavenly flowers; when Rāja-
<div n="lb">dharman (Kāśyapa) asked him the reason
<div n="lb">of his arrival, Gautama told him that since
<div n="lb">he was poor he wanted to go on sea in search
<div n="lb">of wealth; Rājadharman (Kāśyapa) told
<div n="lb">Gautama that he need have no anxiety for
<div n="lb">wealth, since according to Bṛhaspati, there
<div n="lb">were four means of acquiring wealth, viz.
<div n="lb">inheritance, luck, effort, and friend ({%catur-%}
<div n="lb">{%vidhā hy arthagatir bṛhaspatimataṃ yathā/%}
<div n="lb">{%pāraṃparyaṃ tathā daivaṃ karma mitram%}
<div n="lb">{%iti prabho%} 12. 164. 12); Rājadharman, as
<div n="lb">Gautama's friend, would help him to acquire
<div n="lb">wealth; in the morning he asked Gautama to
<div n="lb">go a distance of three {%yojanas%} along a par-
<div n="lb">ticular way where, in the city Meruvraja,
<div n="lb">lived Rājadharman's friend Virūpākṣa the
<div n="lb">chief of the Rākṣasas ({%rākṣasādhipati%});
<div n="lb">Rājadharman was to Virūpākṣa his brother,
<div n="lb">relative and a dear friend; Rājadharman
<div n="lb">always trusted Virūpākṣa ({%sa%} (i. e. Rāja-
<div n="lb">dharman) {%hi mām āśritaḥ sadā%}) 12. 165. 8;
<div n="lb">hence when Gautama met Virūpākṣa he was
<div n="lb">prepared to give Gautama all that he desired
<div n="lb">12. 163. 22-23; 12. 164. 3-16; when Gau-
<div n="lb">tama returned from Virūpākṣa carrying with
<div n="lb">him heavy load of gold to Rājadharman's
<div n="lb">residence under the {%nyagrodha%} tree, the
<div n="lb">latter welcomed Gautama and tried to
<div n="lb">remove his fatigue by fanning him with
[Page049-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">wings; he offered Gautama food 12. 165. 27;
<div n="lb">Gautama thought of returning home but
<div n="lb">since he had nothing to eat on way the
<div n="lb">ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Rāja-
<div n="lb">dharman who was a heap of flesh 12. 165.
<div n="lb">31; Rājadharman had kept fire burning with
<div n="lb">flames for the protection of Gautama at
<div n="lb">night, and he slept by the side of Gautama
<div n="lb">fully trusting him ({%viśvasta%}); Gautama
<div n="lb">killed Rājadharman with a fire-brand; he
<div n="lb">dressed the bird by removing his wings and
<div n="lb">hair ({%sa taṃ vipakṣaromāṇaṃ kṛtvā%} 12.
<div n="lb">166. 4) and roasted him on fire; then taking
<div n="lb">the gold and meat with him Gautama
<div n="lb">started off 12. 166. 1-4; when a couple of
<div n="lb">days passed without Rājadharman's going to
<div n="lb">meet Virūpākṣa on his way home from the
<div n="lb">Brahmaloka, Virūpākṣa was worried about
<div n="lb">Rājadharman's safety; he suspected that
<div n="lb">Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was,
<div n="lb">might have killed Rājadharman; he therefore
<div n="lb">asked his son to visit Rājadharman's residence
<div n="lb">and find out whether he was alive; Virū-
<div n="lb">pākṣa's son saw near the {%nyagrodha%} tree only
<div n="lb">a skeleton of Rājadharman; he and his as-
<div n="lb">sociates pursued Gautama, captured him, and
<div n="lb">returned to Virūpākṣa with the body of Rāja-
<div n="lb">dharman which was without wings, bones and
<div n="lb">feet ({%°śarīraṃ ca pakṣāsthicaraṇojjhitam%}
<div n="lb">12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Virūpākṣa lame-
<div n="lb">nted over the loss of his friend and prepared a
<div n="lb">funeral pyre decorated with jewels, and spread
<div n="lb">over with perfumes and many pieces of
<div n="lb">cloth; after kindling the pyre of Rājadharman,
<div n="lb">Virūpākṣa performed the prescribed funeral
<div n="lb">rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter
<div n="lb">of Dakṣa, happened to stand above the pyre
<div n="lb">(in the sky); the foam from her mouth,
<div n="lb">mixed with milk, fell down on the burning
<div n="lb">pyre; Rājadharman came back to life and
<div n="lb">met Virūpākṣa; at that time Indra arrived
[Page049-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">on the scene and was glad that Rājadharman
<div n="lb">was alive ({%diṣṭyāyaṃ jīvatīty uta%} 12. 167.
<div n="lb">6); Indra told them an old incident ({%purā-%}
<div n="lb">{%tanam%} 12. 167. 7): on a certain occasion,
<div n="lb">Rājadharman had failed to present himself
<div n="lb">in the assembly ({%sadas%}) of Brahmadeva; the
<div n="lb">enraged god cursed Rājadharman to die
<div n="lb">soon ({%tasmād vadhaṃ sa duṣṭātmā nacirāt%}
<div n="lb">{%samavāpsyati%} 12. 167. 9 [{%na cirāt%} seems to
<div n="lb">contradict {%purātanam%}]); hence Rājadharman
<div n="lb">was killed by Gautama, but was again
<div n="lb">revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12.
<div n="lb">167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably dis-
<div n="lb">posed to Rājadharman he was requested by
<div n="lb">Rājadharman to bring Gautama back to life;
<div n="lb">Indra revived Gautama and gave him to
<div n="lb">Rājadharman; delighted Rājadharman em-
<div n="lb">braced Gautama who had with him all kinds
<div n="lb">of vessels full of gold ({%sabhāṇḍopaskaram%}
<div n="lb">12. 167. 13); Rājadharman then took leave of
<div n="lb">Gautama and returned home 12. 167. 11-14;
<div n="lb">Rājadharman, as usual, visited the above of
<div n="lb">Brahmadeva and was received with guest
<div n="lb">worship 12. 167. 15; this narrative of Rāja-
<div n="lb">dharman and Gautama is called {%ākhyāna%}
<div n="lb">12. 167. 18.
