{@Rājadharman@}¦ m.: A mythical crane
({%baka%} 12. 167. 10, 15), also called Kāśyapa
and Naḍījaṅgha.
{@A.@} Birth: Son of Dākṣāyaṇī (referred
to as {%devakanyā%} 12. 163. 19) and Kaśyapa 12.
164. 2. {@B.@} Residence ({%bhavana%} 12. 163.
17; {%nilaya%} 12. 163. 23; {%niveśana%} 12. 166. 10;
{%gṛha%} 12. 166. 6; {%ālaya%} 12. 167. 14): Under a
big {%nyagrodha%} tree, on a space covered with
golden sand, in a forest near the ocean; the
place was frequented by the {%Yakṣas%} and
{%Kinnaras;%} the residence looked like the seat
of Pitāmaha ({%pitāmahasadopamam%}) 12.
163. 6-7; 11-13. {@C.@} Description: Of pure
soul ({%viśuddhātman%} 12. 166. 10), noble-
minded ({%mahātman%} 12. 165. 7; 12. 167. 15),
magnanimous ({%mahāmanas%} 12. 164. 6), of
great understanding ({%mahāmati%} 12. 164. 10),
intelligent ({%dhīmant%} 12. 165. 27), eloquent
({%vāgmin%} 12. 164. 9). {@D.@} Status: King
of the cranes ({%bakarāj%} 12. 164. 9; {%bakarāja%}
12. 166. 2; 12. 167. 2, 5; {%bakapati%} 12. 165.
31; 12. 167. 1, 8; {%bakādhipa%} 12. 167. 5, 13,
14; {%bakendra%} 12. 167. 8); best among the
birds or king of the birds ({%khagottama%} 12.
165. 26; {%khagendra%} 12. 166. 1); Brahma-
deva when angered, however, called him
‘wicked-minded’ ({%duṣṭātman%}) and ‘worst
among the cranes’ ({%bakādhama%}) 12. 167.
9. {@E.@} Visits to Brahmaloka: It was
Rājadharman's practice to go to Brahma-
loka during the first twilight to pay
homage to god Brahmadeva 12. 166. 6;
on his return journey from Brahmaloka
Rājadharman used to meet his friend the
Rākṣaka king Virūpākṣa every day 12. 166.
6. {@F.@} Encounter with the Brāhmaṇa
Gautama: Once when Rājadharman
returned from Brahmaloka in the evening he
met Gautama who happened to be at his
residence 12. 163. 17; Rājadharman received
[Page048-b+ 41]
him as his guest with due rites and offered him
a seat of {%śāla%} flowers; he also gave him big
fishes from Ganges and fire (for his protec-
tion during the night); he fanned Gautama
with his wings to remove his fatigue and
then asked Gautama his {%gotra;%} Gautama
told him only his name and that he was a
Brāhmaṇa but nothing else ({%so 'bravīd%}
{%gautamo 'smīti brāhma nānyad udāharat%}
12. 164. 7); Rājadharman offered his guest
a bed of leaves, rich in fragrance and strewn
with fragrant, heavenly flowers; when Rāja-
dharman (Kāśyapa) asked him the reason
of his arrival, Gautama told him that since
he was poor he wanted to go on sea in search
of wealth; Rājadharman (Kāśyapa) told
Gautama that he need have no anxiety for
wealth, since according to Bṛhaspati, there
were four means of acquiring wealth, viz.
inheritance, luck, effort, and friend ({%catur-%}
{%vidhā hy arthagatir bṛhaspatimataṃ yathā/%}
{%pāraṃparyaṃ tathā daivaṃ karma mitram%}
{%iti prabho%} 12. 164. 12); Rājadharman, as
Gautama's friend, would help him to acquire
wealth; in the morning he asked Gautama to
go a distance of three {%yojanas%} along a par-
ticular way where, in the city Meruvraja,
lived Rājadharman's friend Virūpākṣa the
chief of the Rākṣasas ({%rākṣasādhipati%});
Rājadharman was to Virūpākṣa his brother,
relative and a dear friend; Rājadharman
always trusted Virūpākṣa ({%sa%} (i. e. Rāja-
dharman) {%hi mām āśritaḥ sadā%}) 12. 165. 8;
hence when Gautama met Virūpākṣa he was
prepared to give Gautama all that he desired
12. 163. 22-23; 12. 164. 3-16; when Gau-
tama returned from Virūpākṣa carrying with
him heavy load of gold to Rājadharman's
residence under the {%nyagrodha%} tree, the
latter welcomed Gautama and tried to
remove his fatigue by fanning him with
[Page049-a+ 41]
wings; he offered Gautama food 12. 165. 27;
Gautama thought of returning home but
since he had nothing to eat on way the
ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Rāja-
dharman who was a heap of flesh 12. 165.
31; Rājadharman had kept fire burning with
flames for the protection of Gautama at
night, and he slept by the side of Gautama
fully trusting him ({%viśvasta%}); Gautama
killed Rājadharman with a fire-brand; he
dressed the bird by removing his wings and
hair ({%sa taṃ vipakṣaromāṇaṃ kṛtvā%} 12.
166. 4) and roasted him on fire; then taking
the gold and meat with him Gautama
started off 12. 166. 1-4; when a couple of
days passed without Rājadharman's going to
meet Virūpākṣa on his way home from the
Brahmaloka, Virūpākṣa was worried about
Rājadharman's safety; he suspected that
Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was,
might have killed Rājadharman; he therefore
asked his son to visit Rājadharman's residence
and find out whether he was alive; Virū-
pākṣa's son saw near the {%nyagrodha%} tree only
a skeleton of Rājadharman; he and his as-
sociates pursued Gautama, captured him, and
returned to Virūpākṣa with the body of Rāja-
dharman which was without wings, bones and
feet ({%°śarīraṃ ca pakṣāsthicaraṇojjhitam%}
12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Virūpākṣa lame-
nted over the loss of his friend and prepared a
funeral pyre decorated with jewels, and spread
over with perfumes and many pieces of
cloth; after kindling the pyre of Rājadharman,
Virūpākṣa performed the prescribed funeral
rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter
of Dakṣa, happened to stand above the pyre
(in the sky); the foam from her mouth,
mixed with milk, fell down on the burning
pyre; Rājadharman came back to life and
met Virūpākṣa; at that time Indra arrived
[Page049-b+ 40]
on the scene and was glad that Rājadharman
was alive ({%diṣṭyāyaṃ jīvatīty uta%} 12. 167.
6); Indra told them an old incident ({%purā-%}
{%tanam%} 12. 167. 7): on a certain occasion,
Rājadharman had failed to present himself
in the assembly ({%sadas%}) of Brahmadeva; the
enraged god cursed Rājadharman to die
soon ({%tasmād vadhaṃ sa duṣṭātmā nacirāt%}
{%samavāpsyati%} 12. 167. 9 [{%na cirāt%} seems to
contradict {%purātanam%}]); hence Rājadharman
was killed by Gautama, but was again
revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12.
167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably dis-
posed to Rājadharman he was requested by
Rājadharman to bring Gautama back to life;
Indra revived Gautama and gave him to
Rājadharman; delighted Rājadharman em-
braced Gautama who had with him all kinds
of vessels full of gold ({%sabhāṇḍopaskaram%}
12. 167. 13); Rājadharman then took leave of
Gautama and returned home 12. 167. 11-14;
Rājadharman, as usual, visited the above of
Brahmadeva and was received with guest
worship 12. 167. 15; this narrative of Rāja-
dharman and Gautama is called {%ākhyāna%}
12. 167. 18.
