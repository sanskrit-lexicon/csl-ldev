{@Sṛñjaya@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people,
very likely a section of the Pāñcālas; some-
times they are almost identified with them,
but sometimes mentioned along with them
and/or with Somakas.
{@A.@} Description of their warriors:
Magnanimous ({%mahātman%}) 6. 85. 21; very
vigorous ({%mahaujas%}) 7. 132. 41; heroic
({%vīra%}) 6. 68. 15; of great strength ({%mahā-%}

great chariot-fighters ({%mahāratha%}) 8. 40. 2;
tigers among men ({%puruṣavyāghra%}) 7. 101.
51. {@B.@} Epic events: (1) Bhīma told
Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to
get back the kingdom by waging war
with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count
on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and
Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified
with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him
that all his relatives as well as Sṛñjayas
wish well of him and keep quiet (only he
and Draupadī got excited) ({%sarve te priyam%}
{%icchanti bāndhavāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ/aham%}
{%eko 'bhisaṃtapto mātā ca prativindhyataḥ//%})
3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it
[Page916-a+ 40]
was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their
share of kingdom before war broke out
in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by
Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5.
56. 33; when he sent Saṃjaya to Upa-
plavya, he asked him (Saṃjaya) to enquire
about the health of all including Sṛñjayas
({%teṣāṃ bhāgaṃ … purā yuddhāt sādhu tasya%}
{%pradānam// … anāmayaṃ madvacanena pṛ-%}
{%ccheḥ%}) 5. 22. 8-9, 38; (3) Sañjaya wanted
Yudhiṣṭhira to work for peace so that
Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and the rest
of the assembled kings would live in happi-
ness ({%śamaṃ kuryā yena śarmāpnuyus te%})
5. 24. 9; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya to
communicate the message of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
to the assembly in which Sṛñjayas were
also present 5. 25. 1; Saṃjaya appealed to
all of them to act in a way that would
lead to the well-being of Kurus and Sṛñja-
yas ({%kṛtāñjaliḥ śaraṇaṃ vaḥ prapadye%}
{%kathaṃ svasti syāt kurusṛñjayānām%}) 5.
25. 14; Yudhiṣṭhira failed to see how there
could be well-being for Kurus and Sṛñjayas
when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had usurped the pro-
sperity of Pāṇḍavas ({%kathaṃ svasti syāt%}
{%kurusṛñjayānām/āttaiśvaryo dhṛtarāṣṭraḥ%}
{%parebhyaḥ/%}) 5. 26. 18; Yudhiṣṭhira also
told Saṃjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the
advice of Kṛṣṇa and hence were cap-
able of controlling their enemies and de-
lighting their friends ({%sṛñjayāś … /upāsīnā%}
{%vāsudevasya buddhiṃ … %}) 5. 28. 11; (4)
Saṃjaya told Duryodhana that Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that
Arjuna wanted him to convey to the
Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana
would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna fighting at the head of the army
of Sṛñjayas; he also told Saṃjaya that
[Page916-b+ 40]
their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in
astrology had predicted the destruction of
Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37,
93; (5) Dhṛtarāṣṭra envied those who
could see and listen to the words of Kṛṣṇa
which were meant for the welfare of
Sṛñjayas ({%bhāratīm … śaṅkarīṃ sṛñjayā-%}
{%nām%}) 5. 69. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 71. 2:
{%śaṃkarīṃ kalyāṇakarīm%}); (6) Kṛṣṇa
assured Yudhiṣṭhira that when he met the
Kauravas he would try to keep the agitated
Kurus and Sṛñjayas away from the noose
of death ({%mocayeyaṃ mṛtyupāśāt saṃrab-%}
{%dhān kurusṛñjayān%}) 5. 70. 81; (7) Before
Kṛṣṇa left to meet the Kauravas, Drau-
padī told him that the Pāṇḍavas, along
with Sṛñjayas would be able to face the
army of Kauravas ({%śakṣyanti hi mahābāho%}
{%pāṇḍavāḥ sṛñjayaiḥ saha/dhārtarāṣṭra-%}
{%balaṃ … pratisamāsitum%}) 5. 80. 11 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 5. 82. 11: {%pratisamāsituṃ%}
{%pratipakṣatayā sthātum%}); according to her,
severe punishment should be quickly in-
flicted on Kauravas by Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas
and Kṛṣṇa; he should take care to see
that he, along with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas,
was not blamed for not killing one who
deserved to be killed 5. 80. 14, 18-19;
(8) Kṛṣṇa assured Vidura that he would
attempt to bring about reconciliation
between Kurus and Sṛñjayas who would
otherwise perish in war ({%saṃgrāme vina-%}
{%śiṣyatām%}) 5. 91. 8; (9) Duryodhana
wanted to know from Kṛṣṇa what wrong
did the Kauravas do to Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas or for what fault of Kauravas
did they want to kill Kauravas ({%kim asmā-%}
{%bhiḥ kṛtaṃ teṣāṃ kasmin vā punar āgasi%}) 5.
125. 11; (10) When Ulūka was asked by
Yudhiṣṭhira to convey to the assembly the
[Page917-a+ 40]
view of Duryodhana, he spoke to them
who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas
5. 158. 4-5; (11) Bhīṣma assured Duryo-
dhana that in case of war Droṇa would
kill Sṛñjayas ({%gacched antaṃ sṛñjayānām%})
5. 164. 15; (12) Before the start of the
war, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana to pro-
tect Bhīṣma so that he might kill Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; seeing Bhīṣma at the
head of the Kaurava army, Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, shivered
({%samakampanta pāṇḍavāḥ/sṛñjayāś ca%}
{% … dhṛṣṭadyumnapurogamāḥ//%}) 6. 16. 42;
(13) On the third day of the war, due to
the quickness of Bhīṣma's action, Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas felt that there were many
hundreds and thousands of him ({%aneka-%}
{%śatasāhasram samapaśyanta lāghavāt%}) 6.
55. 22 (also cf. st. 21); (14) On the
fourth day, at one stage, Kurus and Sṛñja-
yas watched the duel between Bhīṣma and
Arjuna 6. 56. 28; (15) On the fifth day,
towards midday ({%madhyandinagate sūrye%} 6.
68. 12), Sṛñjayas fought a very fierce battle
with Kurus in which arrows, {%śaktis, tomaras%}
were used 6. 68. 15-16; the battle describ-
ed 18-19; the same day, later, Sṛñjayas,
when they lost their armours, and their
chariots were broken and bows were cut
off, and their hair dishevelled, they wrestled
with Kurus ({%bāhubhiḥ samayudhyanta%}) 6.
69. 39; when the sun was about to set
({%sūrye 'stam upagacchati%} 6. 70. 34), and
when the stopping of the war was declared,
Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas, went to
their camps 6. 70. 37; (16) On the sixth
day, when Bhīṣma and Droṇa started killing
the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas
fied ({%palāyanaparābhavan%}) 6. 71. 32; (17)
On the seventh day, when Bhīṣma attack-
[Page917-b+ 40]
ed Yudhiṣṭhira, Sṛñjayas riding chariots,
elephants and horses trembled for they
feared Yudhiṣṭhira would soon be killed
({%sarathanāgāśvāḥ samakampanta sṛñjayāḥ%})
6. 82. 2-3; later in the afternoon ({%aparāṃ%}
{%diśam āsthāya sthite savitari%} 6. 82. 28)
Bhīṣma neglected the challenge of Śikha-
ṇḍin and attacked Sṛñjayas; they were
happy to face Bhīṣma ({%sṛñjayās tu tato%}
{%hṛṣṭā … %}) and raised loud roars and blew
their conches; a fierce battle followed in
which chariot-fighters and elephant-riders
mingled with one another 6. 82. 26-28;
(18) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma started
killing Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others; they
attacked Bhīṣma not fearing death (Sṛñja-
yas not directly mentioned, only Pāñcālas
are mentioned); Bhīṣma cut off arms and
heads of those riding horses and elephants
and deprived the chariot-fighters of their
chariots; he also killed elephants 6. 84.
3-7; when Droṇa killed Somakas and
Sṛñjayas a loud cry went up from their
army; the Kṣatriyas rolled on the ground
like those afflicted by ailments; their cry
was like one of those who become lean
due to hunger ({%viveṣṭantaḥ sma dṛśyante%}
{%vyādhikliṣṭā narā iva// … aniśaṃ śrūyate%}
{%śabdaḥ kṣutkṛśānāṃ nṛṇām iva//%}) 6. 85.
20-23; after the death of Irāvant, there
was fierce fighting in which the Kaurava
army and Sṛñjayas, not caring for their
lives in battle, killed one another; with
their hair loose and without their armours,
when they were deprived of their chariots
and their bows were cut off they wrestl-
ed with one another ({%juhvataḥ samare%}
{%prāṇān nijaghnur itaretaram//muktakeśā%}

{%bhiḥ samayudhyanta samavetāḥ paraspa-%}
[Page918-a+ 40]
{%ram//%}) 6. 86. 76-77; when Bhagadatta
proceeded to attack Yudhiṣṭhira, he fought
a severe battle with Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and
Kekayas who were ready to fight with their
weapons ({%udyatāyudhaiḥ%}) 6. 91. 79-80;
Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that since he had
dug up enmity with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
he should fight with them manfully; he him-
self also would kill Somakas and Pāñcālas
(which term includes Sṛñjayas) ({%yudhyasva%}
{%tān adya raṇe … puruṣo bhava%}) 6. 94. 13-
15; (19) At the end of the ninth day,
it appeared that Bhīṣma had defeated
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; so at the start of
the night ({%rātrimukhe%}) Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis
and Sṛñjayas held consultation ({%mantrāya%}
{%samupāviśan%}) 6. 103. 8, 10-11; (20) At
the start of the tenth day, Kaurava army
was being destroyed by the sharp arrows
of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; hence, Bhīṣma,
not caring for life, attacked them 6. 104.
23, 26, 29; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
how on the tenth day Bhīṣma, when attack-
ed by Śikhaṇḍin determined to kill him
(6. 104. 45-46), fought with Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas ({%daśame 'hani%}) 6. 105. 3; when
Bhīṣma began to destroy the Pāṇḍava army,
the great chariot-fighters ({%mahārathāḥ%})
of Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma to kill him
({%vadhāyābhyadravan bhīṣmam%}) 6. 105. 35;
as the war advanced Pāṇḍavas, backed
by Sṛñjayas ({%saṃhatāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ%}),
attacked Bhīṣma 6. 110. 40; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
once again asked Saṃjaya how Bhīṣma
fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas on
the tenth day 6. 111. 1; as advised
by Bhīṣma, Arjuna led Sṛñjayas (and
Pāñcālas) to attack Bhīṣma and kill him;
Sṛñjayas were asked to attack Bhīṣma
without fear as they would be protected by
[Page918-b+ 40]
Bhīma and Arjuna 6. 111. 15-20; exhorted
by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas and Sṛñjayas
attacked Bhīṣma showering weapons on
him ({%śastravṛṣṭyā%}); angered Bhīṣma fought
with them 6. 113. 16-18; the weapons used
by Sṛñjayas are detailed in 6. 114. 2-3;
Sṛñjayas and Pāṇḍavas raised a loud roar
when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 101; at the
end of the tenth day when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was
informed about Bhīṣma's downfall he
wondered who could be the warriors who
surrounded Bhīṣma ({%ke vīrāḥ paryavārayan%})
while he was showering arrows on Pāñcālas
and Sṛñjayas; he also wished to know who
from among the Kauravas were on the
left side of the wheel of Bhīṣma and shot
arrows on Sṛñjayas ({%vāme cakre vartamānāḥ%}
{%ke 'ghnan saṃjaya sṛñjayān%}) 6. 15. 25,
28, 32; (21) On hearing the death of
Bhīṣma (7. 2. 1), Karṇa admitted that the
army which included Pāṇḍavas, Sātyaki,
Kṛṣṇa and Sṛñjayas was invincible by kings;
7. 2. 31; (22) On the eleventh day,
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas met with arrows
Droṇa's attack on them; Droṇa broke and
scattered their army; agitated by the arrows
of Droṇa, they were again and again sca-
ttered by him ({%te kampyamānā droṇena%}
{%bāṇaiḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ/punaḥ punar abha-%}
{%jyanta%}) 7. 6. 33, 35, 41; Sṛñjayas, though
they tried, were not able to kill the army
of Droṇa as it was protected by him; since
Droṇa was acting very swiftly, Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas felt as if there were many Droṇas
({%ekam āśukāriṇam āhave/anekam iva%}
{%saṃtrāsān menire%}) 7. 12. 19, 23; Sṛñjayas
trembled seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning
the army of Pāṇḍavas ({%sākṣād agnim ivo-%}
{%tthitam%}) 7. 13. 2; Sṛñjayas and others with
their weapons raised ({%udyatāyudhāḥ%}) met
[Page919-a+ 40]
the attack of Aśvasena and others; a fierce
battle ensued 7. 15. 11-12; at the sunset
when the withdrawal of the Pāṇḍava army
was declared by Arjuna ({%svāny anīkāni … %}
{%avahārayat%}), Sṛñjayas greeted him for his
deeds during the day 7. 15. 49-50; (23) On
the twelfth day, after killing Śatānīka, Droṇa
repeatedly defeated Sṛñjayas and others;
seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of
Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas trembled; due to the
heroism of Droṇa, a river carrying the
bodies of Kurus and Pāñcālas to the god
of death began to flow ({%nadīm antaka-%}
{%gāminīm%}) 7. 20. 23-24, 34, 36; when Droṇa
killed a Pāñcāla prince, Sṛñjayas and others
attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill
Droṇa’ ({%hata droṇaṃ hata droṇam ity%}
{%āsīt tumulaṃ mahat/%}); but Droṇa agitated
them who were very angry 7. 20. 48-49;
when Sṛñjayas and others were agitated and
were pushed back ({%calitān … praṇunnān%})
by the arrows of Droṇa, Kauravas raised a
loud roar 7. 21. 7-8; Duryodhana drew
attention of Karṇa towards Bhīma who was
deserted by Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas
({%hīnaḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayaiḥ%}) 7. 21. 16; (24)
On the thirteenth day, Pāñcāla army which
included thousands of Sṛñjayas attacked
Droṇa; but Droṇa arrested their advance
with arrows; then Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas did
not attack him 7. 34. 5-7, 10; when Abhi-
manyu defeated Duḥśāsana, Sṛñjayas and
others were delighted 7. 39. 11, 17-18;
when Subhadrā heard the death of Abhi-
manyu, she pitied Sṛñjayas and the rest
who did not seem to know when Abhi-
manyu was felled down ({%dhik kekayāṃs … %}
{%sṛñjayān/ye tvā raṇe gataṃ vīraṃ na%}
{%jānanti nipātitam%}) 7. 55. 13; (25) On the
fourteenth day, Sātyaki shot arrows at
[Page919-b+ 40]
Droṇa who was as though swallowing
({%grasantam iva%}) Sṛñjayas 7. 72. 34; the
demon Alambusa made a river flow on the
battle-field carrying the dead bodies of
Sṛñjayas and others ({%nadīṃ pravartayām%}
{%āsa%}) 7. 83. 30; when the Pāṇḍava army,
which included Sṛñjayas, attacked Droṇa
there was a loud roar among the Sṛñjayas
({%tatrārāvo mahān āsīt%}); when Droṇa
started killing them, Sṛñjayas found no
protector 7. 85. 20, 26; Yudhiṣṭhira assured
Sātyaki that when he (Sātyaki) would leave
to assist Arjuna, Sṛñjayas and others would
be there to protect him (Yudhiṣṭhira) 7.
86. 45; Sṛñjayas and others, thrilled, rushed
at Droṇa to fight with him with all their
might ({%sarvaśaktyā%}); but Droṇa killed
them 7. 101. 50-52; Droṇa asked Duryo-
dhana to go to help Jayadratha; he himself
would obstruct the onward march of
Sṛñjayas and others 7. 105. 21; (26) After
the death of Jayadratha, before the start
of the night war between the fourteenth
and fifteenth day, Droṇa pointed out to
Duryodhana the armies of Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas marching towards him (Droṇa)
7. 126. 31; he directed Duryodhana to hold
back his army if he could, for Kurus and
Sṛñjayas would continue to fight even dur-
ing the night; with these words, Droṇa mar-
ched against Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas ({%tvaṃ%}
{%ca duryodhana balaṃ yadi śaknoṣi dhāraya%})
7. 126. 38-39; then, there was fierce fighting
in the evening ({%saṃdhyāyām%}) all around
between Droṇa and Sṛñjayas 7. 129. 18;
when the fierce fighting progressed during
the night, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas together
attacked Droṇa ({%rātriyuddhe tathā ghore%}
{%vartamāne sudāruṇe%}); Droṇa forced all
of them back killing some of them ({%tān%}
[Page920-a+ 40]
{%sarvān vimukhāṃś cakre kāṃścin ninye%}
{%yamakṣayam%}) 7. 129. 34-35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya how did Kauravas feel
when Droṇa entered the (army of) Sṛñjayas
({%kā vo 'bhūd vai matis tadā%}) 7. 130. 1;
Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas followed Bhīma and
Arjuna who showered arrows on Droṇa
trying to scatter the army of Drupada with
Vāyavyāstra 7. 132. 37, 41; 7. 136. 14;
Aśvatthāman challenged his opponents to
attack him and then killed Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas; they abandoned Aśvatthāman and
fled in all directions ({%vyadravanta diśo daśa%}
7. 135. 19) when their chariots and banners
were scattered ({%viprakīrṇarathadhvajāḥ%}) 7.
135. 51; Duryodhana asked Duḥśāsana and
his other brothers to offer protection to
Droṇa who would then kill Sṛñjayas and
their kings ({%sṛñjayāṃś ca sarājakān%}); when
all Sṛñjayas were killed, Aśvatthāman would
kill Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 139. 24-25; in the
fighting that followed Aśvatthāman cover-
ed Drupada and Droṇa covered Sṛñjayas
with smooth arrows ({%chādayām āsatuḥ%}
{%saṃkhye śaraiḥ saṃnataparvabhiḥ%}) 7. 139.
31; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fight-
ing with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas
raised a loud roar ({%siṃhanādaṃ praca-%}
{%krire%}) 7. 141. 32; considering that Bhīma
had killed Duryodhana, Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas
and others made all effort to attack Droṇa
to fight with him ({%sarvodyogenābhijagmur%}
{% … %}); a fierce battle then was fought 7.
141. 60; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were
being killed by Karṇa, they apprehended
his presence nearby even when a blade of
grass stirred ({%tṛṇapraspandanāc cāpi sūta-%}
{%putraṃ sma menire%}) 7. 148. 15 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 7. 173. 19: {%atibhayāt tṛṇacalana-%}
{%mātreṇāpi karṇaṃ prāptaṃ menire%}); they
[Page920-b+ 40]
mistook a running warrior on their own
side to be Karṇa ({%api svaṃ samare yodhaṃ%}
{%dhāvamānaṃ vicetasaḥ/karṇam evābhya-%}
{%manyanta … %}); hence, afraid, they ran
but Karṇa attacked them from behind
({%pṛṣṭhato vikirañ śarān%}) 7. 148. 15-17;
when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were excessi-
vely tormented by the Rākṣasas of Alā-
yudha they had no peace of mind ({%na%}
{%śāntiṃ lebhire tatra%}) 7. 152. 31; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra wondered why Karṇa, instead of
killing Ghaṭotkaca, did not kill Arjuna
with the {%śakti%} given to him by Indra; for,
the death of Arjuna would have meant the
death of all Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas long
ago 7. 157. 2; the same opinion was held
by Kṛṣṇa (and hence he deluded the mind
of Karṇa whenever he faced Arjuna) 7.
157. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how
did Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas with their armies
arrayed and in striking position ({%vyūḍhānī-%}
{%kāḥ prahāriṇaḥ%}) fight with Kurus and how
did they attack Droṇa who, not caring for
his life, had plunged into their army after
the death of Ghaṭotkaca ({%jīvitaṃ tyaktvā%}
{%gāhamānaṃ varūthinīm%}) 7. 158. 13-15;
Droṇa killed three grand-sons of Drupada
and then defeated Cedis, Kekayas, Sṛñjayas
and Matsyas 7. 161. 31-32; (27) On
the fifteenth day, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas,
although they were being killed by Droṇa,
attacked him and confused him ({%mohayanto%}
{%mahāratham%}) 7. 164. 60; after killing Vasu-
dāna (king of Pāṃśurāṣṭra), Droṇa killed
six thousand Sṛñjayas 7. 164. 85; exhorted
by Yudhiṣṭhira to assist Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the
great chariot-fighters of Sṛñjayas attacked
Droṇa in order to kill him; Droṇa with
great speed moved against them not mind-
ing his death ({%martavyam iti niścitaḥ%});
[Page921-a+ 40]
bad omens occurred; Droṇa, encircled by
the armies of Drupada, moved burning
host of Kṣatriyas and killed a very large
number of them 7. 165. 8-16; when ulti-
mately Droṇa was killed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna,
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas attacked the dis-
heartened Kurus with the result that their
army was shattered ({%nirutsāhān kurūn%}
{% … abhyadravan … tataḥ sainyaṃ vyadīr-%}
{%yata%}) 7. 165. 58; when Aśvatthāman
used his {%nārāyaṇāstra,%} Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas
and Sṛñjayas were dismayed to see the
mid-region filled with different weapons
({%śastrākṛtibhir ākīrṇam atīva … dṛṣṭvā-%}
{%ntarikṣam āvignāḥ pāṇḍupāñcālasṛñjayāḥ%})
7. 170. 20; at the end of the day, when
Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
death of Droṇa, he asked Saṃjaya what
was Droṇa doing on the battle-field
when Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas managed
to kill him ({%kiṃ kurvāṇaṃ raṇe droṇam%}
{%jaghnuḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ%}) 7. 8. 1; Saṃjaya
assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that since he was an
eye-witness to the whole event ({%sarvaṃ%}
{%pratyakṣadarśivān%}) he would narrate to him
how Droṇa fell when overpowered ({%sāditaḥ%})
by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 7. 11. 1; (28)
On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana was
confident that with Karṇa as their general
Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas would
loose their consciousness ({%gatacetasaḥ%}) 8.
6. 31; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that
Karṇa, as intended by Aśvatthāman ({%aśva-%}
{%tthāmanaś ca saṃkalpād … %}) had killed
Sṛñjayas 8. 16. 5; Karṇa brought Sṛñjayas
and Pāñcālas within the range of his arrows
and crushed them ({%śaragocaram ānayat/%}

fought with great effort not caring for
their life ({%vyāyacchamānāḥ subhṛśam … %}

{%priyān asūn raṇe tyaktvā%}) 8. 16. 22, 24-
25; battle described 8. 16. 26-38; at mid-
day ({%madhyaṃ gate dinakare%} 8. 17. 100),
although Karṇa killed Sṛñjayas they attack-
ed him 8. 17. 117; (29) On the seven-
teenth day, early morning ({%prabhātāyāṃ%}
{%rajanyāṃ tu%} 8. 22. 29) before the start of
the war, Duryodhana while requesting Śalya
to act as a charioteer of Karṇa told him
that with a good charioteer like him, Karṇa
would be able to destroy Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcā-
las and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; at the start of
the war on that day, Pāñcālas, Cedis and
Sṛñjayas fought a fierce battle with the
Kaurava army 8. 32. 15; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
remembered that Karṇa had boasted earlier
that he alone would kill Sṛñjayas along
with Pāṇḍavas 8. 35. 2; Sṛñjayas cut off
({%śātayām āsuḥ%}) the arrows shot at them
by Kṛpa 8. 38. 4; Karṇa stopped the on-
ward march of Sṛñjayas and others who
were led by Bhīma 8. 38. 16; Karṇa killed

to Kṛṣṇa that the large army of Sṛñjayas
was being scattered ({%dīryate%}) by Karṇa
8. 40. 81; when Bhīma returned to fight
({%saṃnivṛtto raṇaṃ prati%}), Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed
him 8. 41. 3; Kurus led by Karṇa and
Sṛñjayas led by Yudhiṣṭhira faced one
another without fear ({%abhītāḥ%}) 8. 42. 1;
Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa,
after defeating Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and
[Page922-a+ 40]
Sṛñjayas was looking for Arjuna: when
the Kuru warriors saw Karṇa displaying
his valour by harassing Pāṇḍavas and
thousands of Sṛñjayas they raised a loud
roar ({%nadanti%}); Karṇa encouraged Kau-
rava warriors to attack Sṛñjayas so that
none of them escaped alive ({%yathā jivan%}
{%na vaḥ kaścin mucyate%}) 8. 43. 36; Kṛṣṇa
was glad to point out to Arjuna that Bhīma,
along with Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas, had once
again returned to the battle-field 8. 43. 52;
Yudhiṣṭhira wondered whether the en-
counter of Sṛñjayas and Kauravas in which
he was humiliated had become known to
the fighters ({%kaccit saṃgrāme vidito vā%}

were prepared to fight when they had
resorted to him ({%ete ca sarve pāñcālāḥ%}
{%sṛñjayāś ca sahānvayāḥ/tvāṃ samāsādya%}
{% … vyavasthitāḥ%}) 8. 51. 5; while taking
stock of some of the events of the battle
which had lasted for seventeen days ({%adya%}
{%saptadaśāhāni%} 8. 51. 2), Kṛṣṇa reminded
Arjuna that while Bhīṣma was fighting,
Sṛñjayas were unable to look at him;
Bhīṣma routed Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
and distinguished himself as the sole
war hero ({%ekavīratvam āgataḥ%}) 8. 51. 35;
Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Bhīma,
covered on all sides by Sṛñjayas, was
being tormented while fighting with Karṇa:
if Karṇa was neglected he might kill
Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas 8. 51.
105-106; at one stage in the battle, Utta-
maujas had engaged Sṛñjayas 8. 53. 6;

towards Karṇa, lest he destroyed all Sṛñ-

fought with one another using straight-
flying and very sharp arrows ({%śarais%}
{%tadāñjogatibhiḥ sutejanaiḥ%}) 8. 57. 67; once

between Kurus and Sṛñjayas in which they
used besides arrows weapons like swords,
{%śaktis,%} lances, maces and {%paraśvadhas%} 8.
62. 40; when Karṇa was killed, Arjuna was
honoured by Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others
8. 69. 37; on the seventeenth night ({%niśi%} 8.
1. 25) while reporting Karṇa's death to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra Saṃjaya told him that Karṇa,
before his death, had killed Kekayas and
Videhas in the presence of all Sṛñjayas
and Pāñcālas ({%sa sṛñjayānāṃ sarveṣāṃ%}

the Kurus and Sṛñjayas were dead and who
were alive 8. 4. 3; (30) On the eighteenth

was capable of defeating in battle even
gods and demons, let alone mortals like
Somakas and Sṛñjayas 9. 6. 9; a fierce battle
was fought by Sṛñjayas with Kurus which
terrorized Kurus ({%kurūṇāṃ bhayavardha-%}

{%raudrā%}) filled with the bodies of Kurus
and Sṛñjayas ({%kurusṛñjayasaṃkulā%}) 9. 8.
32; seeing the heroic deeds ({%vikramam%}) of
Śalya, Duryodhana considered Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas (as good as) dead
({%nihatān … mene%}) 9. 12. 28; finally, when
[Page923-a+ 40]
Śalya was killed, Pāṇḍavas and Śṛñjayas
chased the shattered ({%prabhagnān%}) army
of Kauravas 9. 18. 28; when Śālva, riding
an elephant, attacked the Pāṇḍava army,
Sṛñjayas and others thought his swiftly
moving single elephant, to be several
thousands ({%sahasraśo vai vicarantam%}
{%ekam%}) 9. 19. 6; when the Pāṇḍava army
was broken, Kaurava heroes blew, in joy,
their conches; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the general
of the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas,
could not bear the sound of the roar indi-
cative of the joy of Kauravas (8. 19. 10);
seeing the (heroic) deeds of Śālva, Sṛñjayas
and others encircled his elephant 9. 19. 21;

came to witness the duel between Bhīma
and Duryodhana, he embraced Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas and enquired about their
well being ({%apṛcchat kuśalaṃ sarvān%}) 9.
33. 11; Duryodhana asked Yudhiṣṭhira,
along with Sṛñjayas, to watch the duel
9. 54. 38-39; when Duryodhana was forced
to kneel down by Bhīma, Sṛñjayas raised
a loud roar; hearing their roar, Duryo-
dhana was enraged 9. 56. 54-55; when
Bhīma felled down Duryodhana he told
Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas that he
[Page923-b+ 40]
had killed the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra on
the strength of Draupadī's {%tapas (raṇe%}
{%hatāṃs tapasā yājñasenyāḥ)%} 9. 58. 9-10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya what did the
Sṛñjayas do when Duryodhana was struck
down; Saṃjaya told him that they waived
their upper garments and raised a loud
roar; the earth was unable to bear them
who were filled with delight ({%āvidhyan%}

their bow-strings; still others blew their

words and were happy that he had brought
the enmity to an end ({%vairasya ca gataḥ%}
{%pāram%}); they said that the horripilation
experienced by them at the time of Duryo-

{%dhanavadhe yāni romāṇī hṛṣitāni naḥ/adyāpi%}
{%na vihṛṣyanti tāni … %}) 9. 60. 7-16; Kṛṣṇa
told Sṛñjayas not to rebuke Duryodhana
anymore because he was already killed when
he refused to give Pāṇḍavas their share
although advised to do that, among others,
by them ({%°gāṅgevasṛñjayaiḥ/ … procya-%}
