{@Sṛñjaya@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people,
<div n="lb">very likely a section of the Pāñcālas; some-
<div n="lb">times they are almost identified with them,
<div n="lb">but sometimes mentioned along with them
<div n="lb">and/or with Somakas.

<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to
<div n="lb">get back the kingdom by waging war
<div n="lb">with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count
<div n="lb">on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified
<div n="lb">with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him
<div n="lb">that all his relatives as well as Sṛñjayas

<div n="lb">3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it
[Page916-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their
<div n="lb">share of kingdom before war broke out
<div n="lb">in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by
<div n="lb">Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5.
<div n="lb">56. 33; when he sent Saṃjaya to Upa-

<div n="lb">about the health of all including Sṛñjayas

<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira to work for peace so that

<div n="lb">of the assembled kings would live in happi-

<div n="lb">5. 24. 9; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya to
<div n="lb">communicate the message of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
<div n="lb">to the assembly in which Sṛñjayas were
<div n="lb">also present 5. 25. 1; Saṃjaya appealed to
<div n="lb">all of them to act in a way that would

<div n="lb">25. 14; Yudhiṣṭhira failed to see how there
<div n="lb">could be well-being for Kurus and Sṛñjayas

<div n="lb">{%parebhyaḥ/%}) 5. 26. 18; Yudhiṣṭhira also
<div n="lb">told Saṃjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the
<div n="lb">advice of Kṛṣṇa and hence were cap-
<div n="lb">able of controlling their enemies and de-
<div n="lb">lighting their friends ({%sṛñjayāś … /upāsīnā%}

<div n="lb">Saṃjaya told Duryodhana that Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that
<div n="lb">Arjuna wanted him to convey to the
<div n="lb">Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana
<div n="lb">would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭa-
<div n="lb">dyumna fighting at the head of the army
<div n="lb">of Sṛñjayas; he also told Saṃjaya that
[Page916-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in
<div n="lb">astrology had predicted the destruction of
<div n="lb">Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37,
<div n="lb">93; (5) Dhṛtarāṣṭra envied those who

<div n="lb">of death ({%mocayeyaṃ mṛtyupāśāt saṃrab-%}

<div n="lb">was not blamed for not killing one who
<div n="lb">deserved to be killed 5. 80. 14, 18-19;
<div n="lb">(8) Kṛṣṇa assured Vidura that he would
<div n="lb">attempt to bring about reconciliation
<div n="lb">between Kurus and Sṛñjayas who would
<div n="lb">otherwise perish in war ({%saṃgrāme vina-%}
<div n="lb">{%śiṣyatām%}) 5. 91. 8; (9) Duryodhana
<div n="lb">wanted to know from Kṛṣṇa what wrong

<div n="lb">who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas
<div n="lb">5. 158. 4-5; (11) Bhīṣma assured Duryo-

<div n="lb">5. 164. 15; (12) Before the start of the

<div n="lb">and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; seeing Bhīṣma at the

<div n="lb">towards midday ({%madhyandinagate sūrye%} 6.
<div n="lb">68. 12), Sṛñjayas fought a very fierce battle
<div n="lb">with Kurus in which arrows, {%śaktis, tomaras%}

<div n="lb">Bhīṣma neglected the challenge of Śikha-

<div n="lb">their conches; a fierce battle followed in
<div n="lb">which chariot-fighters and elephant-riders
<div n="lb">mingled with one another 6. 82. 26-28;
<div n="lb">(18) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma started
<div n="lb">killing Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others; they
<div n="lb">attacked Bhīṣma not fearing death (Sṛñja-

<div n="lb">chariots; he also killed elephants 6. 84.
<div n="lb">3-7; when Droṇa killed Somakas and
<div n="lb">Sṛñjayas a loud cry went up from their

<div n="lb">informed about Bhīṣma's downfall he
<div n="lb">wondered who could be the warriors who
<div n="lb">surrounded Bhīṣma ({%ke vīrāḥ paryavārayan%})
<div n="lb">while he was showering arrows on Pāñcālas
