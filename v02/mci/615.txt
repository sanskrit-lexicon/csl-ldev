{@Sādhyānāṃ praharaṇam@}¦ nt.: The
weapon of the Sādhyas, not named.
<div n="P">When Garuḍa flew up from a mount-
ain-top to fetch the Soma from the heaven,
there occurred bad omens for the gods, one
of them being that the weapon of the
Sādhyas clashed with that of the Vasus, the
Rudras, the Ādityas, the Maruts and the
other hosts of gods ({%ye cānye devatāgaṇāḥ%});
such a thing had never happened before 1.
26. 29-30. [See {@Sādhya astra@}]
