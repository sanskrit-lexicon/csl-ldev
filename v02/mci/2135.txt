<div n="P">Bhīma in his expedition to the east,

<div n="lb">reference to Dakṣiṇamallas, and in 2. 27. 3
<div n="lb">{%mallānām adhipaṃ caiva%} follows immedi-
<div n="lb">ately after {%sottamān api cottarān,%} it is very
<div n="lb">likely that {%uttarān%} and {%uttamān%} refer to the

<div n="lb">passage would then mean that Bhīma
<div n="lb">conquered the king of Mallas, together with
<div n="lb">the Uttara and Uttama Mallas; Edgerton,
<div n="lb">however, takes Uttara and Uttama as
<div n="lb">names of different peoples, see his note on
<div n="lb">this stanza in Cr. Ed. Vol. II, p. 501).
