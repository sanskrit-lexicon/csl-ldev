son of Parikṣit, who was offering the snake-

know the life story of Āstīka ({%āstīka-%}
{%carita%}), and the narrative ({%ākhyāna%}) was
told to him by his father Pramati 1. 12. 3,

(Vyāsa) to the sages in the Naimiṣa forest

narrative of Āstīka confers long life ({%āyuṣ-%}
{%yam idam ākhyānam āstīkam%}) 1. 14. 4; the
{%ākhyāna%} of Āstīka, his life-story ({%carita%}),
is exceedingly pious ({%dharmiṣṭha%}), increases
merit (of the listener) ({%puṇyavardhana%}),
and is illustrious ({%śrīmat%}); one who recites
it or listens to it from the very beginning
shall have no danger from the snakes 1. 53.
