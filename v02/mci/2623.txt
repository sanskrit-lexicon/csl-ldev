<div n="lb">Ariṣṭanemi that they had searched for him
<div n="lb">but could not find him; then they were
<div n="lb">told by Ariṣṭanemi that they had commi-

<div n="lb">was present in his {%āśrama;%} Haihayas asked
<div n="lb">Tārkṣya how his dead son came back to
<div n="lb">life; they were told that since Ariṣṭanemi
<div n="lb">and his son always acted truthfully and
<div n="lb">never cherished a lie, and since they follow-
<div n="lb">ed religion they had no fear from death
