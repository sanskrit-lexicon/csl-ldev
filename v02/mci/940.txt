{@A.@} Religious rites: (1) {%dāna:%} Nārada
told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that if one gave to
Brāhmaṇas under the constellation Viśākhā
a bull, a milch cow, a cart supplied with
an iron yoke (? or a four-cornered cover-
ing ?) and filled with grain and clothes, he
satisfied the manes and the gods and enjoyed
infinite bliss after death; he met with no
adversities, went to heaven, obtained by
giving this gift as prescribed the desired
means of maintenance, and he certainly
never experienced sufferings of the hell and
similar places ({%viśākhāyām anaḍvāhaṃ%}

Among the omens noticed by Vyāsa before
the start of the war and reported to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra there was one according to which
the planets Bṛhaspati and Śanaiścara were
stationed near the two Viśākhās ({%viśākha-%}
{%yoḥ%}) and they stayed in that position for a
year (for the citation and Nī.'s commentary
see {@Bṛhaspati@}). {@C.@} Simile: (1) Karṇa's
