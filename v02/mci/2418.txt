{%parikīrtitaḥ%}) 1. 2. 72 (i. e. {%adhyāyas%} 1. 5-
12); 1. 5. 6; 1. 53. 27-28; {@D.@} Epic events;
[Page811-a+ 40]
(1) Sages of different families among whom
are mentioned Bhṛgus, Aṅgirases and others,
protected by Yudhiṣṭhira, observed {%vratas%}
{%(dhṛtavratāḥ)%} and followed their {%dharma%}
in the Dvaitavana ({%caranti dharmaṃ … %})
3. 27. 7-8; (2) Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases are
mentioned among the ascetics ({%tāpasān%})
who were honoured by Yudhiṣṭhira on

Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases mentioned among
those sages who appeared on the battle-
field to blame Droṇa since he fought
against {%dharma;%} they told him it was time
for him to abandon life ({%adharmataḥ%}
{%kṛtaṃ yuddhaṃ samayo nidhanasya te%}) 7.
164. 88-89. {@E.@} Past events: (1) Bhṛgus
acted as priests in the sacrifices of Kṛtavīrya
(also cf. 13. 56. 2); he gave them corn
and wealth at the end of Soma sacrifices
({%dhānyena ca dhanena ca%}); after the death
of Kṛtavīrya, his kinsmen, when in need
of money, asked eminent Bhṛgus to give it
since they knew Bhṛgus had wealth; some
Bhṛgus, afraid of Kṣatriyas, parted with
their wealth, but others hid it underground;
when one of the kings was digging the
ground he, by chance, found wealth in the
house of a Bhṛgu; the assembled Kṣatriyas,
due to anger, disregarded the supplications
of the Bhṛgus and killed them all with
sharp arrows; they killed even children,
yet unborn ({%ā garbhād anukṛntantaś … %})
(also cf. 13. 56. 3); when Bhṛgus were thus
being extirpated their wives took shelter
in mountain Himavant; one of them held
her embryo in her thigh for the conti-
nuation of the line of her husband ({%tāsām%}
{%anyatamā garbhaṃ bhayād dādhāra taija-%}
{%sam/ūruṇaikena vāmorūr bhartur kula-%}
{%vivṛddhaye//%}); when the embryo came out
[Page811-b+ 40]
breaking the thigh he deprived the Kṣatrī-
yas of their eyesight; the Kṣatriyas begged
pardon of the Bhṛgu wife 1. 169. 11-22;
the Bhṛgupatnī told the Kṣatriyas that she
had not deprived them of their eyesight;
that was done by the angry Bhārgava
(Aurva); since the Kṣatriyas started killing
even the unborn Bhṛgus she had held her
embryo in the thigh for a hundred years;
in order to do a favour to the Bhṛgu line-
age, the entire Veda along with the six
Vedāṅgas entered her child even when he
was unborn; the child angered by the death
of his ancestors (Bhṛgus) at the hands of
Kṣatriyas had deprived them of their
eyesight and wished to kill them 1. 170.
1-5; Aurva told the Kṣatriyas born in
the lineage of Kṛtavīrya that while he
was in the thigh of his mother he had
heard the cry of his mothers ({%ārāvaṃ%}
{%mātṛvargasya bhṛgūṇāṃ%}) due to the
killings of Kṣatriya; he was angered
because the wretched Kṣatriyas killed
Bhṛgus not sparing even those unborn;
when nobody offered shelter to the wives
of Bhṛgus due to fear, one of them had
concealed him in her thigh (1. 171. 5, 6, 8);
Aurva practised severe penance to take
revenge of the Bhṛgus who were killed
by destroying the worlds; he thought he
would delight the dead Bhṛgus ({%icchann%}
{%apacitiṃ kartuṃ bhṛgūṇāṃ bhṛgusattamaḥ%}
1. 170. 11; Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 1.
179. 10: {%ātmano manaḥ sarveṣāṃ apacitiṃ%}
{%kartuṃ pravaṇaṃ unmukhaṃ icchan sva-%}
{%manopacitiṃ kartuṃ yojayatīty arthaḥ%});
the dead Bhṛgus then descended from the
world of Fathers ({%pitṛlokād upāgamya%})
and asked him to control his anger; they
assured him that the Bhṛgus disregarded
[Page812-a+ 40]
their getting killed by Kṣatriyas not because
of their weakness; they preferred getting
killed by Kṣatriyas because they themselves
were tired of their long life ({%āyuṣā hi%}
{%prakṛṣṭena yadā naḥ kheda āviśat/tadā-%}
{%smābhir vadhas tāta kṣatriyair īpsitaḥ%}
{%svayam//%}); some one hid wealth in the
house of a Bhṛgu in order to anger Kṣatri-
yas; Bhṛgus desired heaven, and had no
longing for wealth, however, death was
powerless to overtake Bhṛgus and suicide
would deprive them from getting good
worlds; hence they found some other way
out (to get killed by Kṣatriyas); what
Aurva had wanted to achieve by the
exercise of his penance was not approved
by Bhṛgus; so they asked him to desist
from doing the sinful act of destroying
the worlds 1. 170. 11-21; (2) Cyavana
told Kuśika the above account and added
that due to the energy of Bhṛgus ({%bhṛgū-%}
{%ṇām eva tejasā%}) in his dynasty his grand-
son would be an ascetic Brāhmaṇa ({%vipra%}
for {%vipraḥ ?%}) having the lustre of fire; he
also told him that a matrimonial alliance
would be established between him (Kuśi-
ka's line) and the Bhṛgus ({%bhavitā tvaṃ%}
{%ca saṃbandhī bhṛgūṇāṃ bhāvitātmanām%})
13. 56. 1-14); ({%bhṛgūṇāṃ kuśikānāṃ ca%}
{%prati saṃbandhakāraṇam%}) 13. 56. 19; (3)
Rāma Jāmadagnya filled at Samantapañ-
caka five ponds with blood of Kṣatriyas
where he offered libations to his fore-
fathers (i. e. Bhṛgus) ({%triḥsaptakṛtvaḥ%}

{%samantapañcake pañca cakāra rudhirahra-%}
{%dān//sa teṣu tarpayām āsa pitṝn bhṛgu-%}
{%kulodvahaḥ%}) 3. 117. 9-10; (4) Vāyu told
Arjuna (Kārtavīrya) that he would face
in future a great danger from the Bhṛgus
[Page812-b+ 40]
({%bhṛgubhyas te bhayaṃ ghoraṃ … %}) 13.
142. 23; (5) As an instance of the super-
iority of Brahmanical lustre and strength
over that of the Kṣatriyas was cited the
past event of Bhṛgus defeating Tālajaṅghas
({%bhṛgavo 'jayaṃs tālajaṅghān%}) 13. 34. 16;
(6) Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases mentioned
among those who attended the anointment
of Skanda as the leader of the army of the
gods 9. 44. 8; (7) At the Raudra {%muhūrta%}
Indra saw in the east Agni entering the
sun with offerings which were offered by
Aṅgirases and Bhṛgus 3. 213. 29. {@F.@}
