{@Sārisṛkva@}¦ m.: A young {%Śārṅgaka%} bird
<div n="lb">(1. 220. 1, 2, 4; {%Śārṅga%} 1. 220. 3).
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Birth: Second son of the sage
<div n="lb">Mandapāla (turned into a {%Śārṅgaka%} bird)
<div n="lb">and {%Śārṅgikā%} Jaritā 1. 221. 8; 1. 220. 16, 17;
<div n="lb">all abandoned by their father when they
[Page066-a+ 41]
<div n="lb">were still in eggs, but not abandoned by
<div n="lb">their mother 1. 220. 17, 19; his father
<div n="lb">expected him to beget children and extend
<div n="lb">the line of his ancestors ({%sārisṛkvaḥ prajā-%}
<div n="lb">{%yeta pitṝṇāṃ kulavardhanaḥ%} 1. 221. 8).
<div n="lb">{@B.@} Description: All of them lustrous,
<div n="lb">heroic seers, and had no fear from fire;
<div n="lb">able speakers 1. 224. 8, 10; 1. 225. 2-3;
<div n="lb">also called ‘who could discourse on {%brahman%}
<div n="lb">({%brahmavādinaḥ%} 1. 220. 17). {@C.@} Khāṇḍava
<div n="lb">fire: When the fire burning the Khāṇḍava
<div n="lb">forest came close, the young birds, who had
<div n="lb">not yet developed wings and feet, told their
<div n="lb">mother to abandon them and fly to a place
<div n="lb">which was free from fire; the mother
<div n="lb">advised them to enter a nearby hole, but
<div n="lb">they refused for the fear of a mouse; the
<div n="lb">mother then left them to their fate; when the
<div n="lb">young ones appealed to their eldest brother
<div n="lb">to do something to save all of them,
<div n="lb">Sārisṛkva said: “You are resolute and
<div n="lb">intelligent, we are in danger to our life;
<div n="lb">there is no doubt that only one among
<div n="lb">many is really heroic and wise” (1. 223.
<div n="lb">3); first Jaritāri, the eldest among them,
<div n="lb">praised god Fire; when his turn came Sāri-
<div n="lb">sṛkva drew the attention of god Fire to their
<div n="lb">condition (deserted by parents; their wings
<div n="lb">not grown) and appealed to him to save
<div n="lb">them since they had no other saviour; Agni
<div n="lb">should protect them that were seeking shelter
<div n="lb">with his benevolent form and his seven
<div n="lb">flames ({%sapta hetayaḥ%} 1. 223. 10); Jāta-
<div n="lb">vedas alone gave heat and he should protect
<div n="lb">the young ‘seers’ ({%ṛṣīn asmān bālakān%}
<div n="lb">{%pālayasva%} 1. 223. 11; 1. 224. 8); the Fire
<div n="lb">informed them that their father had already
<div n="lb">appealed to him to save them; the Fire saved
<div n="lb">the young ones 1. 221. 1-21; 1. 222. 1-18;
<div n="lb">1. 223. 1-25; 1. 220. 20-32; 1. 225. 1;
<div n="lb">when the forest was on fire, Mandapāla, the
[Page066-b+ 39]
<div n="lb">father of the young ones, was worried
<div n="lb">about their safety 1. 224. 2-6, 16; when the
<div n="lb">fire subsided, the mother, and also the father,
<div n="lb">returned to the young ones; the young birds
<div n="lb">did not greet their father nor answered his
<div n="lb">questions; in the end all were reconciled and
<div n="lb">the father left with them for another country
<div n="lb">1. 224 17-32; 1. 225. 1-4.
