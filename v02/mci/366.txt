<div n="lb">He approached Hanūmant and other monkey-
<div n="lb">chiefs with a view to eating them when they
<div n="lb">talked about Jaṭāyu; he asked them who they
[Page064-b+ 39]
<div n="lb">were talking about his brother and introduced
<div n="lb">himself to them as Saṃpāti and the elder
<div n="lb">brother ({%jyeṣṭho bhrātā%} 3. 266. 48) of
<div n="lb">Jaṭāyu; he informed them about his contest
<div n="lb">with his brother in which they flew up to the

<div n="lb">3. 266. 48); as a result his wings were burnt
<div n="lb">but not of Jaṭāyus; with his wings burnt
<div n="lb">down he fell on the mountain Malaya;
<div n="lb">he had not met his brother for quite a long
<div n="lb">time; he was then informed by Hanūmant
<div n="lb">and others that his brother was dead;
<div n="lb">dejected to hear the sad news he asked the
<div n="lb">monkey-chiefs about Rāma and Sītā and how
<div n="lb">his brother got killed; on hearing Rāma's story
<div n="lb">Saṃpāti asked the monkey-chiefs to get up
<div n="lb">and told them that he knew Rāvaṇa and had
<div n="lb">seen his Laṅkā on the other shore of the ocean;
<div n="lb">he was sure that Sītā would be there and had
<div n="lb">no doubt about it; having heard Saṃpāti's
<div n="lb">words Hanūmant and others took counsel
<div n="lb">among themselves how they could cross the
<div n="lb">ocean 3. 266. 46-56; 3. 147. 33 (Saṃpāti not
<div n="lb">named, but referred to as {%gṛdhra%}).
