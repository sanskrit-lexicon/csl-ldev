{@Stavarāja@}¦ m.: Name (?) of a collect-
ion of names ({%nāmasaṃhāram%} 13. 17. 1;
{%nāmasamuddeśam%} 13. 17. 12, 11) of Śiva
13. 17. 21; these are one thousand and
eight names of Śarva 13. 17. 29; the names
are listed in 13. 17. 30-150.
{@A.@} Original composer and transmission:
Originally Brahmā sang the Stava ({%yat%}
[Page221-b+ 41]
{%purā lokakṛj jagau%}) 13. 16. 66; {%yad uktaṃ%}
{%padmayoninā%} 13. 17. 12) and himself
preserved the Stava of Bhagavān (Śiva)
({%stavam etaṃ bhagavato brahmā svayam%}
{%adhārayat%}) 13. 17. 164; 13. 17. 154; 13.
17. 5; 13. 16. 66; from him it went
successively to Śakra (Indra) and others 13.
17. 164-168; one of the receivers in this
line was Taṇḍi who obtained it in the abode
of Brahman after he had performed severe
austerities 13. 17. 165; he handed it over to
Śukra Bhārgava 13. 16. 66; 13. 16. 75 (?);
at the end of the line of transmission stood
Mārkaṇḍeya who taught it to Upamanyu
when the latter had observed certain rules
({%mārkaṇḍeyān mayā prāptaṃ niyamena%}
{%janārdana%} 13. 17. 169) and Upamanyu
gave it to Janārdana (Kṛṣṇa) 13. 17. 168-
169; 13. 17. 1, 5-6; since, in bygone days,
it was once taught by Taṇḍi it also came
to be looked upon as composed by Taṇḍi;
moreover Taṇḍi had brought it down from
heaven to this world ({%yasmāt taṇḍiḥ purā%}
{%prāha tena taṇḍikṛto 'bhavat/svargāc%}
{%caivātra bhūlokaṃ taṇḍinā hy avatāri-%}
{%taḥ//%}) 13. 17. 22; 13. 16. 66. 75; 13. 17.
3; the Stavarāja was brought down (to
this world) from the Brahmaloka 13. 17.
21, 4; Upamanyu is also said to have
received it directly from Taṇḍi ({%taṇḍir%}
{%ākhyātavān mama/nāmāni%}) 13. 16. 73,
72. {@B.@} Activity of Upamanyu: Pitāmaha
(Brahmadeva) had mentioned ten thousand
names of Sarva (Śiva) in the Vedas and
one thousand names of Śarva (Śiva) in the
Śāstras ({%daśa nāmasahasrāṇi vedeṣv āha%}
{%pitāmahaḥ/śarvasya śāstreṣu tathā daśa%}
{%nāmaśatāni vai//%}) 13. 16. 74; 13. 17. 13;
Upamanyu made an abridgement (in the
form of Stavarāja) out of the ten thousand
names as one churns {%ghṛta%} from curds
[Page222-a+ 40]
({%nāmnāṃ kaṃcit samuddeśaṃ vakṣye hy%}

{%dadhno ghṛtam ivoddhṛtam%}) 13. 17. 11, 13.
(for other similes cf. 13. 17. 14); Upa-
manyu gave to Kṛṣṇa this form of the
{%stava,%} which constituted Mahādeva's (Śiva's)
{%carita,%} having fewer words (and syllables)
and being concise in meaning ({%kiṃ tu de-%}
{%vasya mahataḥ saṃkṣiptārthapadākṣaram/%}
{%śaktitaś caritaṃ vakṣye%}) 13. 17. 9; this
abridged form looked upon as the essence of
the original ({%tathaitat sāram uddhṛtam%})
13. 17. 14. {@C.@} Its name: After its
composition Brahmā destined it to be the
king of all the divine {%stavas;%} since then
it came to be known as Stavarāja of
Īśvara ({%sarvastavānāṃ divyānāṃ rājatve%}

13. 17. 169; excellent ({%pravara%}) 13. 17. 4;

13. 16. 66, as eternal {%brahman%} ({%brahma sanā-%}
{%tanam%}) 13. 17. 6. {@E.@} Importance: This
Stavarāja is equal to meditation, practice of
Yoga, the best thing to meditate on; it
deserves to be recited; it is itself knowledge
and the highest secret; if one knows it even
at the end of one's life one can attain the
highest state after life ({%idaṃ dhyānam%}
{%idaṃ yogam idaṃ dhyeyam anuttamam/%}
{%idaṃ japyam idaṃ jñānaṃ rahasyam idam%}
{%uttamam/idaṃ jñātvāntakāte 'pi gacched%}
{%dhi paramāṃ gatim//%}) 13. 17. 18; this
great, eternal secret was proclaimed by
Brahman himself ({%yat tad rahasyaṃ para-%}
{%maṃ brabmaproktaṃ sanātanam%}) 13. 17. 5.
{@F.@} Who may receive the Stavarāja: It may
be taught to one who is devoted (to god), to
one who has faith, and one who believes in
god; but it should not be taught to a non-
believer who is lack of faith in the bodily
form and who has not controlled his self
({%idaṃ bhaktāya dātavyaṃ śraddadhānāsti-%}

1062. on 13. 17. 6); it should not be taught
to one who scorns god Pinākin (Śiva); such
a person goes to hell with his ancestors and
descendants 13. 17. 17; it should be learnt
with due effort and then be preserved by one
who has controlled his mind ({%prayatnenādh-%}

17. 15. {@G.@} Rewards obtained: By listen-
ing to the name of Śarva listed in the Stava-
[Page223-a+ 40]
rāja one obtains all desires 13. 17. 29; by
reciting this Stava the sage Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana
obtained all his desires while he was practis-
ing austerities on mount Meru for a son; he
therefore advised Yudhiṣṭhira to recite the
{%stava%} so that he would also obtain all his
desires by the grace of Maheśvara 13. 18. 1-3;
by praising Śiva with the names in this {%stava%}
one obtains one's Self ({%prāpnoty ātmānam%}
{%ātmanā%}) 13. 17. 153; god Mahādeva is
pleased by the recitation of his names and he
establishes his devotees in himself ({%bhaktā-%}
{%nukampī bhagavān ātmasaṃsthān karoti%}
{%tān%}) 13. 17. 155; by its recitation a person
who is cleansed of his sins becomes devoted
to Bhava (Śiva) which (devotion) leads
him to attain the highest perfection ({%jantor%}

158, 160; the demons, the Yakṣas, the
Rākṣasas, the Piśācas, the Yātudhānas, the
Guhyakas and the snakes do not put
obstacle in the way (of one who recites this
{%stava%}) 13. 17. 170; he who observing rules
of purity and celibacy, with controlled sense-
organs, recites this {%stava%} for one year with-
out a break in application obtains the fruit
of performing an Aśvamedha sacrifice ({%yaḥ%}

{%yaḥ/abhagnayogo varṣaṃ tu so' śvamedha-%}
{%phalaṃ labhet//%}) 13. 17. 171; by praising
god Mahādeva with the names (in this
Stava) Jāmadagnya, who was afflicted by
the sin of killing his father and the
Brāhmaṇas ({%? pitṛvipravadhenāham ārtaḥ;%})
13. 18. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 18. 12: {%pitṛ-%}
{%tulyā viprāḥ ‘jyeṣṭho bhrātā pituḥ samaḥ’%}
{%iti smṛter jyeṣṭhā bhrātaras teṣāṃ vadhena%}),
was freed of the sin; in addition the god
[Page223-b+ 39]
gave him an axe and divine missiles and made
him invincible; god of death would not over-
power Jāmadagnya and he would be famous
13. 18. 9-12 ({%pāpaṃ na bhavitā te 'dya%}
