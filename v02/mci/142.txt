{@Tārā@}¦ f.: A female monkey, wife of
<div n="lb">Vālin.
<div n="lb">{@A.@} Description: Of moon-like face
<div n="lb">({%tārādhipānanā%} 3. 264. 18, {%tārāpatimukhī%}
<div n="lb">3. 264. 39), having moon-like lustre ({%tārā-%}
<div n="lb">{%dhipaprabhā%} 3. 264. 20). {@B.@} Dutiful and
<div n="lb">intelligent wife: She forbade Vālin from start-
<div n="lb">ing out of their residence when he heard
<div n="lb">Sugrīva's loud roar; from the way Sugrīva
<div n="lb">roared, she feared he had found a protector;
<div n="lb">since Tārā could understand the meaning of
<div n="lb">the cries of all beings ({%sarvabhūtarutajñā%}
<div n="lb">3. 264. 19), Vālin asked her to find out whose
<div n="lb">protection Sugrīva had secured; after contem-
<div n="lb">plating for a while she told Vālin incidents
<div n="lb">beginning with the abduction of Sītā upto
<div n="lb">Sugrīva's entering into an alliance with Rāma;
<div n="lb">she also told him about the helpers of Rāma;
<div n="lb">in the opinion of Tārā all these helpers,
<div n="lb">intelligent and strong, were capable of
<div n="lb">destroying Vālin; Vālin misunderstood Tārā's
<div n="lb">advice and doubted that she secretly loved
<div n="lb">Sugrīva; he spoke harsh words to her and
<div n="lb">went out 3. 264. 16-25; in the end Tārā saw
<div n="lb">Vālin fallen on the ground. {@C.@} Marriage
<div n="lb">with Sugrīva: Sugrīva got Tārā, whose
<div n="lb">husband was dead, along with the kingdom
<div n="lb">of Kiṣkindhā 3. 264. 38-39.
