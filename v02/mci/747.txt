{@Bṛhaspatimata@}¦ nt.: Name of a Śāstra
12. 322. 43; referred to as {%bṛhaspater matam%}
in 12. 122. 11.
<div n="P">The Śāstra was originally composed by
the seven sages (Marīci, Atri and others
12. 322. 27) dealing with {%dharma, artha,%}
{%kāma,%} and subsequently with {%mokṣa%} and
other regulations ({%tatra dharmārthakāmā hi%}
{%mokṣaḥ paścāc ca kīrtitaḥ/maryādā vivi-%}
{%dhāś caiva%} 12. 322. 30); Manu Svāyaṃbhuva,
and Uśanas and Bṛhaspati when the two
would be born, were to propound the {%śāstra%}
of the seven sages; the {%śāstra%} will be
received by king Vasu 12. 322. 26-30;
35-37; 41-44; it was studied, along with
the Auśanasa śāstra, also by king Vasuhoma
of the Aṅgas; hence king Māndhātṛ asked
Vasuhoma to tell him how {%daṇḍa%} came into
existence and how afterwards it came to be
established among the Kṣatriyas ({%tad ahaṃ%}
{%śrotum icchāmi daṇḍa utpadyate katham/%}
{% … kathaṃ kṣatriyasaṃsthaś ca daṇḍaḥ%}
{%saṃpraty avasthitaḥ%}) 12. 122. 11-13. [See
