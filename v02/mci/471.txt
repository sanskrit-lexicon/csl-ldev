{@Kiṃkara@}¦ m.: A missile of Mṛtyu or
Yama.
<div n="P">Kiṃkara of Mṛtyu identified with his
Daṇḍa (?) ({%mṛtyor vai kiṃkaro daṇḍaḥ%})
13. 61. 24 [{%kiṃkara iti daṇḍasya nāma%}
Comm. of an unidentified author, see Cr. Ed.
Vol. 17. Part II. Critical Notes p. 1079];
but Kiṃkara and Daṇḍa of Mṛtyu seem to be
different (perhaps {%kiṃkara = pāśa,%} see end of
this entry); Bhīma would fight even with
Mṛtyu equipped with Kiṃkara and Daṇḍa
({%kiṃkarodyatadaṇḍena (?) mṛtyunāpi vrajed%}
{%raṇam%}) 8. 34 20; Duryodhana with his raised
{%gadā%} compared with Yama with his hand
raised with Kiṃkara ({%vaivasvatam iva krud-%}
{%dhaṃ kiṃkarodyatapāṇinam%}) 9. 31. 47 [but
Nī. on 8. 50. 24 (Bom. Ed.) {%kareṇcdyato%}
{%daṇḍo yena tena mṛtyunā samaḥ/kiṃśabda%}

came to take away Satyavān ({%suptaṃ cainaṃ%}
{%yamaḥ sākṣād upāgacchat sakiṃkaraḥ%}) 3.
282. 38; Yama came to take away Satyavān
with {%pāśa%} in hand ({%pāśahasta%}) 3. 281. 9;
Satyavān bound by the {%pāśa%} 3. 281. 16, and
[Page096-a+ 39]
later released 3. 281. 54; hence {%kiṃkara%}
likely to be the same as {%pāśa.%} [See {@Daṇḍa@}].
