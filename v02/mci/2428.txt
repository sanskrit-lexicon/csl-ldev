the army which was engulfed by angered
Matsyas ({%matsyakaikeyaiḥ … /vṛtān saman-%}
{%tāt saṃkruddhair%}) 7. 133. 2-3; when every-
body believed that Duryodhana was killed
by Bhīma, Matsyas rushed towards Droṇa
to fight with him with utmost effort ({%sarvo-%}
{%dyogenābhijagmur droṇam eva yuyutsayā%})
7. 141. 60; Droṇa defeated all Matsyas
and even killed many of them ({%matsyāṃś%}

army was routed by Aśvatthāman, Arjuna
supported by Matsyas faced Kauravas 7.
172. 3; (34) On the sixteenth day, Matsyas
and the rest surrounded Karṇa with their
chariots, horses, elephants and valorous
foot-soldiers and struck him with various
weapons; bent on killing Karṇa they spoke
harsh words to him ({%bhāṣanto vāgbhir%}
{%ugrābhiḥ sarve karṇavadhe vṛtāḥ%}) 8. 21. 26-
27; Karṇa scattered them away ({%apovāha%})

44; the surviving Matsyas ({%matsyaśeṣāḥ%}),
to help Yudhiṣṭhira, checked Karṇa 8. 33.
22; Matsyas and others, protected by
Arjuna were able to reduce the army of
Kauravas ({%kṛtaḥ śatrugaṇakṣayaḥ%}) 8. 51.
6; Kṛṣṇa remembered that earlier in the
war, Bhīṣma had killed Matsyas with
arrows 8. 51. 27; when Matsyas were gett-
ing killed ({%vadhyamānāḥ%}) they attacked
Karṇa and afflicted him with arrows
({%śarasaṃghaiḥ samārdayan%}); but Karṇa

feat of Śālva, Matsyas uttered cries of
despair; their excellent heroes obstru-
cted the elephant of Śālva from all sides
({%hāhākārair nādayantaḥ sma yuddhe/%}

19. 21; (37) Night of the eighteenth day:
after the massacre in the camp of Pāṇḍavas,
