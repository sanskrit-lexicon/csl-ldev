<div n="lb">ntly Śeṣa is meant, but is not directly named
<div n="lb">16. 5. 12-13. {@C.@} Śeṣa's austerities and
<div n="lb">meeting with Brahmadeva: Śesa deserted
<div n="lb">his mother Kadrū and visited the slopes of
<div n="lb">the Himālayas; there on the Gandhamādana
<div n="lb">mountain and in Badarī, as also at other holy
<div n="lb">places like Gokarṇa, Puṣkarāraṇya and in
<div n="lb">various {%tīrthas%} and holy abodes ({%āyataneṣu%}
<div n="lb">1. 32. 4) Śeṣa practised severe austerities
<div n="lb">living on wind and observing difficult vows;
<div n="lb">he lived all alone and had controlled his
[Page062-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">senses ({%ekāntaśīlī, vijitendriyaḥ%} 1. 32. 4);
<div n="lb">during the austerities he put on bark garments
<div n="lb">and wore matted hair; his flesh, skin and
<div n="lb">sinews dried up; when Pitāmaha Brahman,
<div n="lb">saw Śeṣa in this condition he asked him to
<div n="lb">do something beneficial to the people instead
<div n="lb">of tormenting them by his severe austerities;
<div n="lb">he asked Śeṣa the reason for undertaking the
<div n="lb">austerities; Śeṣa told Pitāmaha that his
<div n="lb">serpent brothers were dull-witted; they envied
<div n="lb">each other and did not suffer either Vinatā
<div n="lb">or her son (Vainateya Garuḍa) who was
<div n="lb">their cousin; they hated Garuḍa; Śeṣa there-
<div n="lb">fore did not want to see his brothers nor live
<div n="lb">with them; Śeṣa undertook austerities to give
<div n="lb">up his body and to avoid the company of his
<div n="lb">brothers in the next life; he asked Pitāmaha's
<div n="lb">permission to do that 1. 32. 5-12; Brahman
<div n="lb">told Śeṣa that his brothers faced danger
<div n="lb">because they had offended their mother but
<div n="lb">that incident had been taken care of; since
<div n="lb">Śeṣa was devoted to righteousness ({%diṣṭyā%}
<div n="lb">{%ca buddhir dharme te%} 1. 32. 16), Pitāmaha
<div n="lb">offered him a boon 1. 32. 13-16; Śeṣa
<div n="lb">desired to find pleasure in righteousness

<div n="lb">({%tapas%}) 1. 32. 17. {@D.@} Śeṣa as supporter
<div n="lb">of the earth: Brahman was pleased with Śeṣa's
<div n="lb">self-control and equanimity and asked him
<div n="lb">to collect the earth properly and hold it so
<div n="lb">that it became steady for the benefit of the
<div n="lb">creatures; Śeṣa agreed to do what Brahman
<div n="lb">desired and asked Brahman to place the
<div n="lb">earth on his head; Brahman asked him to go
<div n="lb">below the earth for which earth would
<div n="lb">provide an opening ({%vivara%}) 1. 32. 21-22;
<div n="lb">Śeṣa entered the earth through a cleft and
<div n="lb">held the divine ({%devī%}) earth, girdled by the
<div n="lb">oceans, after enclosing it on all sides; he made
<div n="lb">the earth firm 1. 32. 19-22; 5. 101. 2; 6. 63.

<div n="lb">Nārāyaṇa: Nārāyaṇa told Mārkaṇḍeya that
<div n="lb">he, having become Śeṣa, supports the earth
<div n="lb">surrounded by the four oceans and adorned
<div n="lb">by Meru and Mandara 3. 187. 10; when the
<div n="lb">entire creation, both moving and non-moving,
<div n="lb">gets lost in one single ocean, god Viṣṇu Nārā-
<div n="lb">yaṇa sleeps alone on the bed of water on the
<div n="lb">huge body of Śeṣa; at that time with Śeṣa's
<div n="lb">great coil Viṣṇu encompasses the whole earth
<div n="lb">and sustains it 3. 194. 8-10; Hari Nārāyaṇa
<div n="lb">when he is in his {%nidrāyoga%} also sleeps on
