<div n="lb">with Bhīma: When Bhīma was wandering on
<div n="lb">the peaks of the Gandhamādana mountain in
<div n="lb">search of heavenly lotus flowers having
<div n="lb">heavenly fragrance, he made big noise with his
<div n="lb">conch near the thicket of banana trees; hear-
<div n="lb">ing it, the lions and the elephants roared; the
[Page081-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">big noise aroused Hanūmant who was asleep
<div n="lb">in the thicket; as he woke up, yawning, he
<div n="lb">hit the ground with his large tail which looked
<div n="lb">like the flag staff of Indra and produced
<div n="lb">sound like a thunder; when Bhīma marched
<div n="lb">forward to search the source of this sound
<div n="lb">he saw Hanūmant lying on a thick stone-
<div n="lb">slab in the midst of the banana trees 3. 146.
<div n="lb">59-64; description of Hanūmant 3. 146. 65-
<div n="lb">71; when Bhīma roared loudly Hanūmant
<div n="lb">opened his eyes a little, looked despisingly
<div n="lb">at Bhīma, and asked Bhīma why he woke
<div n="lb">him up who was happily asleep; he told
<div n="lb">Bhīma that as an intelligent human being
<div n="lb">Bhīma should have shown compassion for
<div n="lb">other beings; Bhīma therefore did not know
<div n="lb">his {%dharma;%} Hanūmant then asked Bhīma
<div n="lb">the purpose of his arriving at a place which
<div n="lb">was not supposed to be visited by human
<div n="lb">beings; the mountain, beyond that point, could
<div n="lb">not be crossed unless one had acquired per-
<div n="lb">fection ({%siddhagati%} 3. 146. 79); Hanūmant
<div n="lb">advised Bhīma to eat the roots and fruits
<div n="lb">to be found there which were as good as
<div n="lb">{%amṛta%} and return 3. 146. 72-81; when Bhīma
<div n="lb">introduced himself to Hanūmant as a Pāṇ-
<div n="lb">ḍava and son of Vāyu, Hanūmant responded
<div n="lb">with a smile but asked Bhīma to return rather
<div n="lb">than proceed further and meet with danger;
<div n="lb">when Bhīma insisted that he must proceed
<div n="lb">and for that purpose Hanūmant should get
<div n="lb">away from his path, Hanūmant replied that
<div n="lb">it was not possible for him to move as he was
<div n="lb">suffering from an ailment; if Bhīma must pro-
<div n="lb">ceed he should cross over him; when Bhīma
<div n="lb">said he was prepared to go beyond him and
<div n="lb">the mountain as Hanūmant had crossed the
<div n="lb">ocean, Hanūmant asked Bhīma who was that
<div n="lb">Hanūmant, Bhīma replied that Hanūmant
<div n="lb">was his brother, meritorious, brave and in-
[Page081-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">telligent, famous in the Rāmāyaṇa; he crossed
<div n="lb">the ocean to find out Rāma's wife; knowing
<div n="lb">Bhīma to be arrogant due to the strength of
<div n="lb">his arms, Hanūmant again told him that as he
<div n="lb">could not move due to old age Bhīma should
<div n="lb">set aside his tail from the path and proceed;
<div n="lb">Bhīma failed in his attempt to lift the tail
<div n="lb">and stood with his face turned down due to
<div n="lb">shame; he bowed down to Hanūmant asking
<div n="lb">for forgiveness; Bhīma requested Hanūmant
<div n="lb">to reveal his identity and let him know whether
<div n="lb">he was a {%siddha,%} a god, a Gandharva, or a
<div n="lb">Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147.
<div n="lb">17-22; Hanūmant then told Bhīma who he
<div n="lb">really was and that he used to live with
<div n="lb">Sugrīva on the Ṛśyamūka mountain since
<div n="lb">the latter was cheated by his brother Vālin
<div n="lb">3. 147. 27; Hanūmant further told Bhīma
<div n="lb">that he had gone out with other crores of
<div n="lb">monkeys in search of Sītā and was informed
<div n="lb">by a vulture (Jaṭāyus) about Sītā; he had
<div n="lb">then jumped over the ocean, one hundred
<div n="lb">{%yojanas%} wide, seen Sītā in Rāvaṇa's house,
<div n="lb">and returned after announcing himself to
<div n="lb">Rāvaṇa; when Rāma finally started (for
<div n="lb">Ayodhyā) Hanūmant had asked the following
<div n="lb">boon from Rāma: “May I live as long as the
<div n="lb">story of Rāma lasts”; the boon was granted
<div n="lb">to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the
<div n="lb">narrative of Rāma ({%tasya vīrasya caritam%}
<div n="lb">3. 147. 39) to please Hanūmant; Hanūmant
<div n="lb">again told Bhīma that no mortal could go
<div n="lb">beyond the point where they met since it was
<div n="lb">frequented by the gods; Hanūmant informed
<div n="lb">Bhīma that he had blocked Bhīma's way les the
<div n="lb">should be attacked or cursed by some one, and
<div n="lb">that the lake he was searching for was close
<div n="lb">by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhīma then told Hanūmant
<div n="lb">that he was highly blessed by his meeting with
<div n="lb">Hanūmant; Bhīma requested him to show the
[Page082-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">unrivalled form which he had assumed when he
<div n="lb">leapt over the ocean; only then Bhīma would
<div n="lb">believe what Hanūmant had told about him-
<div n="lb">self; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that it was
<div n="lb">not possible to assume forms of the bygone age;
<div n="lb">one acquired the strength, form and prowess
<div n="lb">according to the {%yuga%} in which one lived; he
<div n="lb">had to follow the (rule of the) {%yuga,%} since no
<div n="lb">one could go beyond Time ({%yuge yuge/bala-%}
<div n="lb">{%varṣmaprabhāvā hi prahīyanty udbhavanti%}
<div n="lb">{%ca … yugaṃ samanuvartāmi kālo hi dura-%}
<div n="lb">{%tikramaḥ%} 3. 148. 7, 8); when Bhīma persisted
<div n="lb">in his request, Hanūmant increased his body
<div n="lb">immensely to look like mountain Maināka
<div n="lb">and showed Bhīma the form he had assumed
<div n="lb">to cross the ocean 3. 149. 2-4; description
<div n="lb">of the body 3. 149. 4-7, 13; Hanūmant
<div n="lb">told Bhīma that he could grow even more,
<div n="lb">as much as he liked; Bhīma then requested
<div n="lb">Hanūmant to assume his former shape 3.
<div n="lb">149. 8-12 (Hanumant st. 8) when Bhīma
<div n="lb">asked why Rāma himself had to go to Rā-
<div n="lb">vaṇa when Hanūmant could destroy Laṅkā,
<div n="lb">Hanūmant told him that if he had killed
<div n="lb">Rāvaṇa, Rāma's fame would have suffered 3.
<div n="lb">149. 14-20; Hanūmant then permitted Bhīma
<div n="lb">to depart and showed him the way leading
<div n="lb">to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of
<div n="lb">Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the
<div n="lb">flowers himself and asked him to show regard
<div n="lb">for the deities; he asked Bhīma not to act
<div n="lb">rashly but follow the {%dharma%} 3. 149. 21-24;
<div n="lb">Hanūmant then gave a long discourse on
<div n="lb">{%dharma%} to Bhīma (explaining to him {%trayī,%}
<div n="lb">{%vārtā%} and {%daṇḍanīti;%} the duties of the four
<div n="lb">{%varṇas;%} the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52;
<div n="lb">Hanūmant contracted his body and embraced
<div n="lb">Bhīma; the embrace removed Bhīma's fatigue;
<div n="lb">with faltering voice and tears in his eyes
<div n="lb">Hanūmant asked Bhīma to remember him and
[Page082-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having
<div n="lb">embraced a mortal (Bhīma) Hanūmant was
<div n="lb">happy to be reminded of Rāma; Hanūmant
<div n="lb">offered a boon to Bhīma: if Bhīma so wished
<div n="lb">Hanūmant could go Hāstinapura and kill the
<div n="lb">sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra or crush their town with
<div n="lb">a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhīma told Hanū-
<div n="lb">mant that he (H.) had already done all that he
<div n="lb">could do for Bhīma; instead of a boon he only
<div n="lb">asked for Hanūmant's forgiveness and favour;
<div n="lb">the Paṇḍavas had found in Hanūmant their
<div n="lb">support which would help them to win the war;
<div n="lb">hearing that Hanūmant told Bhīma that due to
<div n="lb">brotherly feelings and friendliness ({%bhrātṛtvāt%}
<div n="lb">{%sauhṛdāc cāpi%} 3. 150. 13), whenever Bhīma
<div n="lb">roared in battles, Hanūmant would add his
<div n="lb">roar to it and increase its volume; he would
<div n="lb">stand on the flag-staff of Arjuna and roar
<div n="lb">which would deprive the enemies of their
<div n="lb">lives; hence Arjuna's banner often described
<div n="lb">as marked by a monkey ({%vānara, kapi,%}
<div n="lb">{%śākhāmṛga,%} but the monkey is not named
<div n="lb">Hanūmant) 5. 47. 46; 5. 59. 13; 6. 56. 7,

<div n="lb">so saying Hanūmant disappeared 3. 150.
<div n="lb">14-15. {@F.@} Meeting with Rāma and the fight
<div n="lb">between Vālin and Sugrīva: When Rāma
<div n="lb">and Lakṣmaṇa arrived on top of the Ṛśya-
<div n="lb">mūka mountain and saw five monkeys,
<div n="lb">Hanūmant, as a messenger of Sugrīva,
<div n="lb">approached them; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa first
<div n="lb">talked with Hanūmant and then approached
<div n="lb">Sugrīva to form friendship with him 3. 264.
<div n="lb">9-11; (later, in the fight between Vālin and
<div n="lb">Sugrīva) when Rāma could not distinguish
<div n="lb">between them, Hanūmant stuck a garland
[Page083-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">round the neck of Sugrīva 3. 264. 33.
<div n="lb">{@G.@} Search for Sītā: After the search for Sītā,
<div n="lb">when Hanūmant and the other monkey-chiefs
<div n="lb">were returning to the Ṛśyamūka mountain, on
<div n="lb">way they rested in the {%madhuvana;%} Sugrīva
<div n="lb">interpreted this behaviour ({%praṇaya%} 3. 266.
<div n="lb">28) as indicating that Hanūmant and others
<div n="lb">were successful in their mission; the monkey-
<div n="lb">chiefs who had gone for the search then
<div n="lb">approached Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva
<div n="lb">3. 266. 26-30; looking at the complexion of
<div n="lb">Hanūmant and his gait Rāma understood
<div n="lb">that he had seen Sītā; Hanūmant informed
<div n="lb">Rāma that he had brought the good tidings;
<div n="lb">he then described to Rāma his search for
<div n="lb">Sītā in the south 3. 266. 31-55 (meeting the
<div n="lb">female ascetic Prabhāvatī in the house of the
<div n="lb">Daitya Maya; meeting with Saṃpāti and
<div n="lb">obtaining from him the information that
<div n="lb">Sītā must be with Ṛāvaṇa in Laṅkā and that
<div n="lb">Laṅkā lay beyond the ocean); when no one
<div n="lb">was prepared to cross the ocean, Hanūmant
<div n="lb">did it after entering his father (i. e. Vāyu:
<div n="lb">{%tataḥ pitaram āviśya pupluve 'haṃ māhār-%}
<div n="lb">{%ṇavam%}) and killing on way an acquatic
<div n="lb">Rākṣasī ({%jalarākṣasī%}) 3. 266. 57; in
<div n="lb">Laṅkā, Hanūmant saw Sītā in the inner
<div n="lb">apartment of Rāvaṇa ({%tatra sītā mayā%}
<div n="lb">{%dṛṣṭā rāvaṇāntaḥpure satī%} 3. 266. 58);
<div n="lb">having determined her identity Hanūmant
<div n="lb">approached her and told her that he was the
<div n="lb">son of god Wind and the messenger of Rāma;
<div n="lb">he told Sītā that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
<div n="lb">safe and had enquired after Sītā's well-being;
<div n="lb">he assured her that he was a monkey and
<div n="lb">not a Rakṣasa, and that Rāma would soon
<div n="lb">arrive in Laṅkā with his monkeys; Sītā told
<div n="lb">him that she knew him already to be Hanū-
<div n="lb">mant as was reported to her by the Rākṣasa
<div n="lb">Avindhya; she gave Hanūmant a jewel and
[Page083-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">permitted him to leave; to convince Rāma
<div n="lb">that Hanūmant had met her, Sītā told him
<div n="lb">the incident of Rāma throwing a reed at a
<div n="lb">crow on the Citrakūṭa mountain; Hanūmant
<div n="lb">then burnt Laṅkā and returned to Rāma
<div n="lb">3. 266. 58-68. {@H.@} Encounter with indi-
<div n="lb">vidual demons in Rāma's war with Rāvaṇa:
<div n="lb">Hanūmant marched at the head of the army
<div n="lb">when it started towards the sea in the south
<div n="lb">3. 267. 16; when the demon Dhūmrākṣa
<div n="lb">attacked the army of the monkeys, Hanū-
<div n="lb">mant rushed towards him; this act inspired
<div n="lb">confidence in the monkeys; the fight between
<div n="lb">the two was fierce like the one between Indra
<div n="lb">and Prahlāda; Dhūmrākṣa struck Hanūmant
<div n="lb">with maces ({%gadā%}) and clubs ({%parigha%}),
<div n="lb">and Hanūmant retaliated with trees; finally
<div n="lb">Hanūmant killed Dhūmrākṣa together with
<div n="lb">his horses, chariot and charioteer 3. 270. 7,
<div n="lb">12-14; when Lakṣmaṇa was engaged in
<div n="lb">fighting with the demons Vajravega and
<div n="lb">and Pramāthin, Hanūmant attacked Vajra-
<div n="lb">vega and killed him with the summit of a
<div n="lb">mountain ({%adriśṛṅga%}) 3. 271. 24; Hanūmant
<div n="lb">was among the monkey-chiefs who watched
<div n="lb">over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell
<div n="lb">down on the ground tied with the arrows of
<div n="lb">Indrajit 3. 273. 4; he was one of those who
<div n="lb">applied water, sent by Kubera, to their eyes
<div n="lb">which enabled them to see invisible beings 3.
<div n="lb">273. 10-13; Hanūmant and other monkey-
<div n="lb">chiefs surrounded Rāvaṇa when he rushed at
<div n="lb">Rāma 3. 274. 3. {@I.@} Sītā's boon: At the
<div n="lb">time of boon-givings after the war Sītā gave
<div n="lb">Hanūmant the following boon: “You will
<div n="lb">live as long as the fame of Rāma lasts ({%rāma-%}
<div n="lb">{%kīrtyā samaṃ putra jīvitaṃ te bhavīṣyati%}),
<div n="lb">and that the heavenly enjoyments will wait
<div n="lb">on you” 3. 275. 43-44. {@J.@} Messenger to
<div n="lb">Bharata: When Rāma approached the city
[Page084-a+ 38]
<div n="lb">of Ayodhyā he sent Hanūmant to Bharata as
<div n="lb">his messenger to give him the good news
<div n="lb">(of Rāma's return); when Hanūmant, came
<div n="lb">back, Rāma met Bharata at Nandigrāma 3.
