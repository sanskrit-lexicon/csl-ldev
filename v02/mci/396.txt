<div n="lb">jāpati satisfied with drinking {%amṛta,%} emitted
<div n="lb">fragrance ({%surabhi%}) while belching; he saw
<div n="lb">his daughter Surabhi coming out of his mouth
<div n="lb">produced by belching ({%udgārasaṃvṛtlā%})
<div n="lb">13. 76. 17, 18; hence described as ‘born of
<div n="lb">nectar’ ({%amṛtasaṃbhavā%}) 5. 100. 1; (2)
<div n="lb">Daughter of Brahman 13. 128. 10 (Surabhī).

<div n="lb">11. 29; 13. 82. 30, 31, 34; 13. 151. 7 and
<div n="lb">{%śubhā, śobhanā%} ‘brilliant, shining’ her
<div n="lb">special epithets 3. 10. 8, 15; 12. 167. 3; 13.
<div n="lb">82. 29, 31, 37; ‘gentle’ ({%saumyā%}) 13. 151.
<div n="lb">7, yet ‘very proud’ ({%atigarvitā%}) 1. 93, 8;

<div n="lb">({%amṛtadhenuṃ payomucam/sā sṛṣṭā … kṣa-%}
<div n="lb">{%ramāṇā payo'mṛtam%} 13. 128. 10); Surabhi
<div n="lb">yields milk after reaching the outskirts of the
<div n="lb">Kāñcana mountain on the shore of the ocean
<div n="lb">in which flows golden water ({%kāncanaśaila-%}
<div n="lb">{%sya kāñcanāmbuvahasya ca/ udadhes tīram%}
<div n="lb">{%āsādya%}) 5. 108. 10. {@D.@} Progeny: She gave
<div n="lb">birth to a cow (Nandinī) by Kaśyapa; Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb">got Nandinī as his {%homadhenu%} 1. 93. 8;
<div n="lb">mother of cows ({%gavām mātā%}) 3. 219. 32;
<div n="lb">5. 100. 1; mother of cows yielding nectar-
<div n="lb">like milk ({%payo'mṛtam%}) 13. 128. 10; mother
<div n="lb">of cows who are themselves mothers of the
<div n="lb">world ({%lokamātaraḥ%}) 13. 76. 18; four cows
[Page074-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">born to her, Surūpā, Haṃsakā, Subhadrā and
<div n="lb">Sarvakāmadughā, dwell in four directions
<div n="lb">protecting and guarding them 5. 100. 7-10;
<div n="lb">mother of bulls 3. 10. 7. {@E.@} Eminence:
<div n="lb">(1) The Goloka granted to Surabhī by Brah-
<div n="lb">man stands above the three worlds; as
<div n="lb">decreed by Brahman, Surabhī was to get there
<div n="lb">all human and divine enjoyments and happi-
<div n="lb">ness of dwelling in heaven; her worlds are
<div n="lb">provided with all objects of desire and neither
<div n="lb">death, nor old age, nor fire steps in there;
<div n="lb">neither wretchedness nor inauspiciousness is
<div n="lb">met with in the Goloka; the Goloka could be
<div n="lb">obtained by mortals only by practising great
<div n="lb">austerities and doing good deeds 13. 82. 37-
<div n="lb">40; (2) She is mentioned in the {%daivata-%}
<div n="lb">{%vaṃśa%} narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira;
<div n="lb">recitation of this {%vaṃśa%} destroys sin 5. 151.
<div n="lb">7, 2; (3) She is mentioned among those
<div n="lb">who are present in the {%sabhā%} of Brahmadeva
<div n="lb">2. 11. 29. {@F.@} Functions: Residing in
<div n="lb">the {%rasātala,%} the seventh world of the earth,
<div n="lb">she lets milk flow continually which is pro-
<div n="lb">duced from the essence of the earth and
<div n="lb">which, as a {%rasa,%} constitutes the essence of
<div n="lb">all the six {%rasas;%} out of her milk, falling on
<div n="lb">the earth, is created the sea of milk; water of
<div n="lb">the ocean that was churned by the gods and
<div n="lb">the demons was mixed with the milk of
<div n="lb">Surabhi and her four daughters; milk oozing
<div n="lb">from Surabhi provides nectar ({%sudhā%}) to
<div n="lb">those whose food is {%sudhā, svadhā%} for the
<div n="lb">manes, and {%amṛta%} for those who live on
<div n="lb">{%amṛta%} 5, 100. 1, 2, 4, 7-13. {@G.@} Events:
<div n="lb">(1) Seeing Aditi practising severe austerities,
<div n="lb">Surabhi did the same on the peak of the
<div n="lb">Kailāsa mountain, standing on one foot and
<div n="lb">resorting to the highest {%yoga%} ({%paramaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%yogam āsthitā%} 13. 82. 28); this she did for ten
<div n="lb">thousand and ten hundred years; tormented by
[Page075-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">her austerities, gods, big snakes ({%mahora-%}
<div n="lb">{%gāḥ%}), and sages went to her with Brahman;
<div n="lb">Brahman asked her the reason for practising
<div n="lb">austerities and granted her a boon; Surabhī
<div n="lb">({%surabhy uvāca%}) did not ask for anything
<div n="lb">saying that Brahman's satisfaction with her
<div n="lb">austerities was as good as a boon; since
<div n="lb">Surabhī (13. 82. 33) practised austerities not
<div n="lb">craving for anything ({%alobhakāmyayā tapasā%}
<div n="lb">13. 82. 34) Brahman granted her immortality
<div n="lb">and a world of her own to be known as Goloka
<div n="lb">12. 82. 26 35; this narration forms part of an
<div n="lb">old Itihāsa which includes a dialogue between
<div n="lb">Pitāmaha and Indra 13. 82. 6; (2) Surabhi
<div n="lb">once went to heaven and cried aloud; Indra
<div n="lb">took pity on her and asked her why she was
<div n="lb">crying; she wept for her son, the bull, who
<div n="lb">though weak and emaciated was forced to
<div n="lb">draw the plough and was pierced with a goad;
<div n="lb">one of the two bulls yoked to the plough was
<div n="lb">strong and it carried the yoke ahead of the
<div n="lb">other ({%? ekas tatra balopeto dhuram udvahate%}
<div n="lb">{%'dhikām%} 3. 10. 12); the other who was weak
<div n="lb">and lean bore the burden with difficulty;
<div n="lb">Surabhi grieved because of the torture of the
<div n="lb">weak bull; when Indra asked her that while
<div n="lb">she had thousands of sons who were tortured
<div n="lb">why did she weep over a particular one,
<div n="lb">Surabhi replied that all her sons were equal
<div n="lb">to her but she had more compassion for the
<div n="lb">weak; on hearing what Surabhī (3. 10. 17)
<div n="lb">had said Indra realized that a son was
<div n="lb">more than one's life; narrating this, Vyāsa
<div n="lb">advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to adopt the attitude of
<div n="lb">Surabhi and have more sympathy for those
<div n="lb">among his sons who were reduced to a
<div n="lb">wretched condition (i. e. for the Pāṇḍavas) 3.
<div n="lb">10. 5-19; the dialogue between Surabhi and
<div n="lb">Indra called a great and excellent {%ākhyāna%}
<div n="lb">({%mahad ākhyānam uttamam/surabhyāś%}
[Page075-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">{%caiva saṃvādam indrasya ca viśāṃ pate%}
<div n="lb">3. 10. 6); (3) Surabhi, while taking the
<div n="lb">oath to prove that she had not stolen the
<div n="lb">lotus ({%puṣkara%}) of Agastya said: “let
<div n="lb">(the cow) who has stolen your {%puṣkara%} be
<div n="lb">milked with her feet tied by the rope made
<div n="lb">from {%balvaja,%} the milk-pot used to collect
<div n="lb">milk be made of {%kāṃsya,%} and the calf used
<div n="lb">to induce her to give milk be not her own”
<div n="lb">13. 96. 41; (4) Surabhi happened to stand
<div n="lb">in the sky when the body of Rājadharman
<div n="lb">(the king of the cranes) was being cremated
<div n="lb">by his Rākṣasa friend; milk streamed from
<div n="lb">her udder ({%sā babhūva payasvinī%}), and foam
<div n="lb">from her mouth mixed with milk dropped down
<div n="lb">on the body of Rājadharman which brought
<div n="lb">him back to life 12. 167. 1-5; (5) Once, froth
<div n="lb">from the mouth of Surabhī's (13. 128. 10)
<div n="lb">calf fell on Śiva's body; angered, Śiva burnt
<div n="lb">all the cows who then became of different
<div n="lb">colours; Brahman ({%lokaguru%}) pacified Śiva
<div n="lb">and gave the bull (i. e. that calf) to Śiva
<div n="lb">to serve him as vehicle and as a distinguishing
<div n="lb">mark on his banner ({%vṛṣaṃ cemaṃ dhvajā-%}
<div n="lb">{%rthaṃ me dadau vāhanam eva ca%}) 13. 128.
<div n="lb">11-12. {@H.@} Mahāgraha: She is included
<div n="lb">among the afflictions ({%mahāgraha%} 3. 219. 41)
<div n="lb">which are not favourable to children until
<div n="lb">they are sixteen years old and are favourable
<div n="lb">afterwards; a bird perches on her head and
<div n="lb">eats the children with her 3. 219. 32, 41, 22.
