12. 167. 3; 13. 82. 26; once, (Dakṣa) Pra-
jāpati satisfied with drinking {%amṛta,%} emitted
fragrance ({%surabhi%}) while belching; he saw
his daughter Surabhi coming out of his mouth
produced by belching ({%udgārasaṃvṛtlā%})
13. 76. 17, 18; hence described as ‘born of
nectar’ ({%amṛtasaṃbhavā%}) 5. 100. 1; (2)
Daughter of Brahman 13. 128. 10 (Surabhī).

({%amṛtadhenuṃ payomucam/sā sṛṣṭā … kṣa-%}
{%ramāṇā payo'mṛtam%} 13. 128. 10); Surabhi
yields milk after reaching the outskirts of the
Kāñcana mountain on the shore of the ocean
in which flows golden water ({%kāncanaśaila-%}
{%sya kāñcanāmbuvahasya ca/ udadhes tīram%}
{%āsādya%}) 5. 108. 10. {@D.@} Progeny: She gave
birth to a cow (Nandinī) by Kaśyapa; Vasiṣṭha
got Nandinī as his {%homadhenu%} 1. 93. 8;
mother of cows ({%gavām mātā%}) 3. 219. 32;
5. 100. 1; mother of cows yielding nectar-
like milk ({%payo'mṛtam%}) 13. 128. 10; mother
of cows who are themselves mothers of the
world ({%lokamātaraḥ%}) 13. 76. 18; four cows
[Page074-b+ 40]
born to her, Surūpā, Haṃsakā, Subhadrā and
Sarvakāmadughā, dwell in four directions
protecting and guarding them 5. 100. 7-10;
mother of bulls 3. 10. 7. {@E.@} Eminence:
(1) The Goloka granted to Surabhī by Brah-
man stands above the three worlds; as
decreed by Brahman, Surabhī was to get there
all human and divine enjoyments and happi-
ness of dwelling in heaven; her worlds are
provided with all objects of desire and neither
death, nor old age, nor fire steps in there;
neither wretchedness nor inauspiciousness is
met with in the Goloka; the Goloka could be
obtained by mortals only by practising great
austerities and doing good deeds 13. 82. 37-
40; (2) She is mentioned in the {%daivata-%}
{%vaṃśa%} narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira;
recitation of this {%vaṃśa%} destroys sin 5. 151.
7, 2; (3) She is mentioned among those
who are present in the {%sabhā%} of Brahmadeva
2. 11. 29. {@F.@} Functions: Residing in
the {%rasātala,%} the seventh world of the earth,
she lets milk flow continually which is pro-
duced from the essence of the earth and
which, as a {%rasa,%} constitutes the essence of
all the six {%rasas;%} out of her milk, falling on
the earth, is created the sea of milk; water of
the ocean that was churned by the gods and
the demons was mixed with the milk of
Surabhi and her four daughters; milk oozing
from Surabhi provides nectar ({%sudhā%}) to
those whose food is {%sudhā, svadhā%} for the
manes, and {%amṛta%} for those who live on
{%amṛta%} 5, 100. 1, 2, 4, 7-13. {@G.@} Events:
(1) Seeing Aditi practising severe austerities,
Surabhi did the same on the peak of the
Kailāsa mountain, standing on one foot and
resorting to the highest {%yoga%} ({%paramaṃ%}
{%yogam āsthitā%} 13. 82. 28); this she did for ten
thousand and ten hundred years; tormented by
[Page075-a+ 40]
her austerities, gods, big snakes ({%mahora-%}
{%gāḥ%}), and sages went to her with Brahman;
Brahman asked her the reason for practising
austerities and granted her a boon; Surabhī
({%surabhy uvāca%}) did not ask for anything
saying that Brahman's satisfaction with her
austerities was as good as a boon; since
Surabhī (13. 82. 33) practised austerities not
craving for anything ({%alobhakāmyayā tapasā%}
13. 82. 34) Brahman granted her immortality
and a world of her own to be known as Goloka
12. 82. 26 35; this narration forms part of an
old Itihāsa which includes a dialogue between
Pitāmaha and Indra 13. 82. 6; (2) Surabhi
once went to heaven and cried aloud; Indra
took pity on her and asked her why she was
crying; she wept for her son, the bull, who
though weak and emaciated was forced to
draw the plough and was pierced with a goad;
one of the two bulls yoked to the plough was
strong and it carried the yoke ahead of the
other ({%? ekas tatra balopeto dhuram udvahate%}
{%'dhikām%} 3. 10. 12); the other who was weak
and lean bore the burden with difficulty;
Surabhi grieved because of the torture of the
weak bull; when Indra asked her that while
she had thousands of sons who were tortured
why did she weep over a particular one,
Surabhi replied that all her sons were equal
to her but she had more compassion for the
weak; on hearing what Surabhī (3. 10. 17)
had said Indra realized that a son was
more than one's life; narrating this, Vyāsa
advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to adopt the attitude of
Surabhi and have more sympathy for those
among his sons who were reduced to a
wretched condition (i. e. for the Pāṇḍavas) 3.
10. 5-19; the dialogue between Surabhi and
Indra called a great and excellent {%ākhyāna%}
({%mahad ākhyānam uttamam/surabhyāś%}
[Page075-b+ 40]
{%caiva saṃvādam indrasya ca viśāṃ pate%}
3. 10. 6); (3) Surabhi, while taking the
oath to prove that she had not stolen the
lotus ({%puṣkara%}) of Agastya said: “let
(the cow) who has stolen your {%puṣkara%} be
milked with her feet tied by the rope made
from {%balvaja,%} the milk-pot used to collect
milk be made of {%kāṃsya,%} and the calf used
to induce her to give milk be not her own”
13. 96. 41; (4) Surabhi happened to stand
in the sky when the body of Rājadharman
(the king of the cranes) was being cremated
by his Rākṣasa friend; milk streamed from
her udder ({%sā babhūva payasvinī%}), and foam
from her mouth mixed with milk dropped down
on the body of Rājadharman which brought
him back to life 12. 167. 1-5; (5) Once, froth
from the mouth of Surabhī's (13. 128. 10)
calf fell on Śiva's body; angered, Śiva burnt
all the cows who then became of different
colours; Brahman ({%lokaguru%}) pacified Śiva
and gave the bull (i. e. that calf) to Śiva
to serve him as vehicle and as a distinguishing
mark on his banner ({%vṛṣaṃ cemaṃ dhvajā-%}
{%rthaṃ me dadau vāhanam eva ca%}) 13. 128.
11-12. {@H.@} Mahāgraha: She is included
among the afflictions ({%mahāgraha%} 3. 219. 41)
which are not favourable to children until
they are sixteen years old and are favourable
afterwards; a bird perches on her head and
eats the children with her 3. 219. 32, 41, 22.
