{@Harivarṣa@}¦ nt. (sg.): Name of a Varṣa.
{@A.@} Location: Beyond Himavant and
Śveta mountains and the Hāṭakadeśa and
Gandharvanagara which were near the
Mānasa lake 2. 24. 27; 2. 25. 1-5 (see
section {@C.@} Epic events below); according to
another reference, beyond the Bhāratavarṣa
and only beyond the Haimavatavarṣa and
the Hemakūṭa mountain ({%idaṃ tu bhārataṃ%}
{%varṣaṃ tato haimavataṃ param/hemakūṭāt%}
{%paraṃ caiva harivarṣaṃ pracakṣate//%}) 6. 7.
6. {@B.@} Qualities of men and of the land:
In the Varṣas beyond the Himavant moun-
tain in the north there are holy Janapadas
where beings of all kinds live ({%tatra puṇyā%}
{%janapadās … /vasanti teṣu sattvāni nānā-%}
{%jātīni sarvaśaḥ//%}) 6. 7. 5; according to
[Page931-a+ 40]
Saṃjaya the qualities of men living in
the four {%yugas%} of the Bhāratavarṣa were
bettered by those who lived in the Haima-
vata Varṣa and more than that by those in
the Harivarṣa ({%guṇottaraṃ haimavataṃ%}
{%harivarṣaṃ tataḥ param%}) 6. 11. 14; the lands
around Harivarṣa were known as Uttara-
kurus and no battles ever took place on that
land ({%uttarāḥ kuravo hy ete nātra yuddhaṃ%}
{%pravartate%}) 2. 25. 11; for other charac-
teristics of the land see Epic event (No. 1)
below. {@C.@} Epic events: (1) Arjuna in his
expedition to the north ({%diśaṃ dhanapater%}
{%iṣṭām%} 2. 23. 9; 2. 24. 1) before the Rājasūya
went from the Hāṭaka Deśa to Harivarṣa;
he wished to conquer also that Varṣa but
was told by the gatekeepers, having large
bodies and great strength, that the city could
not be conquered by him; he should return
since the city could not be entered by
men; if men did enter, they would certainly
die ({%idaṃ puraṃ yaḥ praviśed dhruvaṃ sa%}
{%na bhaven naraḥ%}) 2. 25. 10; (Nī., Bom. Ed.
2. 28. 10: {%na bhavet mriyetety arthaḥ%});
moreover, if Arjuna entered it he would
not be able to see anything ({%neha drakṣyasi%}
{%kiṃcana/na hi mānuṣadehena śakyam%}
{%atrābhivīkṣitum%}) 2. 25. 11-12; Arjuna agreed
to return from Harivarṣa if the country
could not be entered by men; they asked
him if they could do something for him;
Arjuna desired sovereignty for Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and some tribute for him ({%pārthivat-%}
{%vaṃ cikīrṣāmi dharmarājasya dhīmataḥ/%}
{% … yatkiṃcit karavan naḥ pradīyatām%});
after receiving from the gatekeepers tribute
in the form of heavenly garments, heavenly
ornaments and heavenly stripped-off hairy
skins of antelopes Arjuna turned back
({%tato divyāni vastrāni divyāny ābharaṇāni%}
[Page931-b+ 39]
{%ca/mokājināni divyāni tasmai te pradaduḥ%}
{%karam//%}) 2. 25. 13-16 (Nī., Bom. Ed.
2. 28. 16 reads {%kṣaumājināni%} in place of
{%mokājināni%} and explains {%kṣumātasīviśeṣaḥ%}
{% … tattantunirmitāni kṣaumāṇi ajināni ca/%});
(2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to describe
to him the Harivarṣa in details (how long
the people there lived, the fruits they
received for their actions, auspicious or
otherwise, their past, present and future
({%pramāṇam āyuṣaḥ sūta phalaṃ cāpi śubhā-%}
{%śubham/anāgatam atikrāntaṃ vartamānaṃ%}
{%ca saṃjaya%}) 6. 11. 1-2; Saṃjaya then
told to him the qualities of the people of
the Bhāratavarṣa in the four Yugas and
further told him that the qualities were
found in a higher degree in the Harivarṣa
6. 11. 3-14 (see above section {@B.@}).
