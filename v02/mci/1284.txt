{@Tuṅgaka@}¦ nt.: Name of a forest.
{@A.@} Past events: (1) The sage Sāras-
vata, the son of Aṅgiras, formerly taught
there the lost Vedas while he was sitting on
the upper garments of the great sages; when
his pupils pronounced properly the syllable
{%‘om’%} whatever each one of them had learnt
before came back to him ({%tuṅgakāraṇyam%}
{%āsādya brahmacāri jitendriyaḥ/vedān%}
{%adhyāpayat tatra ṛṣiḥ sārasvataḥ purā//%}
{%tatra vedān pranaṣṭāṃs tu muner aṅgi-%}
{%rasaḥ sutaḥ/upaviṣṭo maharṣīṇām uttarī-%}
{%yeṣu bhārata//oṃkāreṇa yathānyāyaṃ%}
[Page359-a+ 37]
{%samyaguccāritena ca/yena yat pūrvam%}
{%abhyastaṃ tat tasya samupasthitam//%}) 3.
83. 43-45; (2) many sages and gods like
Varuṇa, Agni, Prajāpati, Hari-Nārāyaṇa,
Mahādeva (had assembled there); Pitāmaha
(Brahmadeva) appointed Bhṛgu to perform a
sacrifice ({%bhṛguṃ niyojayām āsa yājanār-%}
{%the%}); the blessed (Bhṛgu) then established
again fire for the sages according to the rites;
the gods and sages, satisfied by their shares of
the clarified butter, went happily to the three
worlds 3. 83. 46-49. {@B.@} Holiness: The
sin of every one, whether man or woman,
who enters the Tuṅgaka forest is destroyed;
a wise person who is controlled and subsists
on limited food ({%dhīro niyato niyatāśanaḥ%}),
if he lives there for a month he will go to-
the Brahmaloka and will purify his family
3. 83. 50-51.
