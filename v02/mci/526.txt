{@Prasvāpa@}¦ nt.: Name of a missile which
sent the adversary to sleep.
<div n="P">It was fashioned by Viśvakarman
({%viśvakṛtam%}) and it belonged properly to
Prajāpati ({%prājāpatyam%}) 5. 184. 12; des-
cribed as ‘dear’ ({%sudayita, dayita%}) 5. 184.
11; 5. 184. 15; 5. 185. 23; it was known
to Bhīṣma in his former life ({%pūrvasmin%}
{%dehadhāraṇe%}); in his long-drawn fight with
Rāma Jāmadagnya, when Bhīṣma was deject-
ed, the eight Vipras (Vasus) reminded him
of this missile in a dream and told him
that it would flash upon him again ({%idam%}
{%astram sudayitam pratyabhijñāsyate bha-%}
{%vān%}); the missile was not known to Rāma
Jāmadagnya, and to no one else on the
earth; the Vipras advised Bhīṣma to employ
it forcefully ({%bhṛśaṃ saṃyojayasva%} 5. 184.
13) against Rāma Jāmadagnya; as a result
Rāma would not die but just go to sleep;
in its use against his teacher Rāma, Bhīṣma
would incur no sin; Bhīṣma will have
thus defeated Rāma with Prasvāpāstra (to
be awakened by him later by using Saṃbo-
dhanāstra); since Rāma could not be killed
in battle, he was to be defeated by using
Prasvāpāstra; the Vipras told Bhīṣma that
a hero sent to sleep in battle and the
one killed were considered by them equal
({%prasuptaṃ vā mṛtaṃ vāpi tulyaṃ manyā-%}
{%mahe vayam%} 5. 184. 16) 5. 184. 9-17; the
next day when Bhīṣma thought of the missile
for employing it, it flashed in his mind
({%cintitaṃ ca tad astraṃ me manasi pratya-%}
{%bhāt tadā%}) 5. 185. 22-23; the gods, appear-
ing in the heaven, however, forbade Bhīṣma
[Page118-b+ 39]
from using Prasvāpa against Rāma; as
Bhīṣma put the arrow on his bow, Nārada
drew Bhīṣma's attention to what the gods
asked him and he told Bhīṣma not to insult
Rāma who was his teacher; the eight Vipras
also asked Bhīṣma to do what Nārada told
him, since therein lay the welfare of the worlds
({%etad dhi paramaṃ śreyo lokānām%}); hence
Bhīṣma withdrew the missile; when Rāma
saw Bhīṣma withdrawing the missile he
accepted defeat at the hands of Bhīṣma
({%dṛṣṭvā tad astraṃ vinivartitaṃ vai/jito%}
{%'smi Bhīṣmeṇa sumandabuddhir ity eva%}
{%vākyaṃ sahasā vyamuñcat%}) 5. 186. 1-8.
