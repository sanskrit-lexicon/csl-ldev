<div n="lb">Balarāma arrived at the Dvaitavana and

<div n="lb">(having many kinds of trees and birds, which

<div n="lb">the demon Kirmīra in the Kāmyaka forest,
<div n="lb">the Pāṇḍavas proceeded towards the Dvaita-
<div n="lb">vana 3. 12. 18; (2) The Pāṇḍavas wishing
[Page367-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">to settle down for their forest life near the lake
<div n="lb">Dvaitavana, entered the forest Dvaitavana
<div n="lb">3. 25. 13, 16; (3) In the Dvaitavana (not
<div n="lb">named) the Pāṇḍavas sported in the auspici-
<div n="lb">ous woods of the Śāla trees along the river
<div n="lb">Sarasvatī; there Yudhiṣṭhira satisfied the
<div n="lb">twice-borns by offering them large-sized roots
<div n="lb">and fruit; there Dhaumya officiated for their
<div n="lb">religious rites to gods and manes; sage
<div n="lb">Mārkaṇḍeya arrived there as a guest of the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas 3. 26. 1-4; (4) When the Pāṇḍa-
<div n="lb">vas lived in the Dvaitavana, the forest
<div n="lb">was full of Brāhmaṇas; the forest resounded
<div n="lb">with the sound of Vedic recitations of the
<div n="lb">Brāhmaṇas and the sound of the bow-strings
<div n="lb">of the Pāṇḍavas; thus the Kṣatriya valour,
<div n="lb">united with Brahmanic lustre, shone all the
<div n="lb">more in the forest ({%saṃsṛṣṭaṃ brahmaṇā%}
<div n="lb">{%kṣatraṃ bhūya eva vyarocata%}); Baka Dāl-
<div n="lb">bhya pointed out to Yudhiṣṭhira Bhṛgus and
<div n="lb">others who, when protected by Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb">gave offerings in fire ({%caranti dharmaṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%puṇye 'smiṃs tvayā guptā dhṛtavratāḥ%}) 3.
<div n="lb">27. 1-8; (5) Vyāsa advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
<div n="lb">leave the Dvaitavana since staying long at
<div n="lb">one place was not desirable; hence he went
<div n="lb">from the Dvaita to the Kāmyaka forest 3.
<div n="lb">37. 31-32, 37; (6) Later when the
<div n="lb">Pāṇḍavas returned to the Dvaitavana from
<div n="lb">the Gandhamādana, the ascetics in the forest
<div n="lb">returned to them 3. 174. 22; (7) Karṇa
<div n="lb">suggested to Duryodhana to visit the lake
<div n="lb">Dvaitavana to show the pomp of the Kauravas
<div n="lb">to the Pāṇḍavas 3. 226. 12-13; Duryodhana
<div n="lb">approved of this idea; his only purpose was
<div n="lb">to oust the Pāṇḍavas from the forest ({%na%}
<div n="lb">{%hi dvaitavane kiṃcid vidyate 'nyat prayo-%}
<div n="lb">{%janam/utsādanam ṛte teṣām vanasthānāṃ%}
<div n="lb">{%mama dviṣaḥ%}), and to show them, who
<div n="lb">were in miserable condition, his pomp 3.
[Page368-a+ 40]
<div n="lb">227. 5, 8-11; Karṇa suggested that their
<div n="lb">pretext to visit the Dvaitavana should be to
<div n="lb">meet the cowherds who awaited Duryodhana's
<div n="lb">visit ({%ghoṣā dvaitavane sarve tvatpratīkṣā%}
<div n="lb">{%narādhipa/ghoṣayātrāpadeśena gamiṣyāmo%}
<div n="lb">{%na saṃśayaḥ%}) 3. 227. 19, 23; (8)
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira reminded the Kauravas through
<div n="lb">Saṃjaya of their defeat at the hands of the
<div n="lb">Gandharvas in the Dvaitavana, where they
<div n="lb">had arrived for the Ghoṣayātrā, and their
<div n="lb">subsequent release from the captivity of
<div n="lb">their adversaries by Bhīmasena and Arjuna
<div n="lb">5. 23. 25; Śalya later alleged that in that
<div n="lb">encounter with the Gandharvas Karṇa was
<div n="lb">the first to run away from the battle
<div n="lb">8. 28. 59; (9) After the Ghoṣayātrā
<div n="lb">incident the Pāṇḍavas lived happily in the
<div n="lb">Dvaitavana forest 3. 235. 25; (10)
<div n="lb">Duḥśāsana sent a messenger to the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">and the Brāhmaṇas living in the Dvaitavana
<div n="lb">to invite them to attend Duryodhana's
<div n="lb">Vaiṣṇava Yajña 3. 242. 7; (11) Yudhi-
<div n="lb">ṣṭhira, disturbed by Karṇa's vow to kill
<div n="lb">Arjuna, thought of leaving the Dvaita-
<div n="lb">vana 3. 243. 21; (12) While living in the
<div n="lb">Dvaitavana, Yudhiṣṭhira once saw deer in a
<div n="lb">dream who requested him to leave the forest
<div n="lb">and go elsewhere as, on account of their pre-
<div n="lb">sence, only a few deer were left in that forest
<div n="lb">3. 244. 2, 5; (13) At the end of the
<div n="lb">twelfth year of their forest life the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb">went from the Kāmyaka to the Mārkaṇḍeyā-
<div n="lb">śrama in the Dvaitavana 3. 294. 43; 3. 295.
<div n="lb">3; (14) During their stay in the Dvaita-
<div n="lb">vana the Pāṇḍavas, while once braving for the
<div n="lb">sake of a Brāhmaṇa ({%brāhmaṇārthe parā-%}
<div n="lb">{%krāntāḥ%}), met with great difficulty which,
<div n="lb">however, ended happily 17. 3. 18-19; 18. 3.
<div n="lb">31 (a reference to the Yakṣapraśṇa episode;
<div n="lb">Yudhiṣṭhira was tested by Dharma in that
[Page368-b+ 40]
<div n="lb">episode which took place in the Dvaitavana
<div n="lb">3. 295. 7-3. 298. 25); (15) Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb">at the end of the twelfth year, while dismiss-
<div n="lb">ing those who stayed with him in the forest,
<div n="lb">asked them to tell people that they did not
<div n="lb">know where the Pāṇḍavas went after they
<div n="lb">(the Pāṇḍavas) left them in the Dvaitavana
<div n="lb">4. 4. 5; (16) In the Dvaitavana Arjuna
<div n="lb">used to praise the heroic qualities of Sātyaki
<div n="lb">for Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 85. 61; (17) Yudhiṣṭhira,
<div n="lb">humiliated by Karṇa, blamed Arjuna for not
<div n="lb">killing Karṇa and told Arjuna that he should
<div n="lb">have admitted to the Pāṇḍavas in the
<div n="lb">Dvaitavana itself that he would not be able
<div n="lb">to stand up to Karṇa in the war 8. 48. 2;
<div n="lb">(18) Yudhiṣṭhira was dejected at the thought
<div n="lb">of the destruction in the war and was think-
<div n="lb">ing of retiring to forest; Draupadī then
<div n="lb">reminded him of his resolve to kill
<div n="lb">Duryodhana and rule the earth which he had
<div n="lb">announced to his brothers in the Dvaitavana
<div n="lb">12. 14. 8; (19) In the Dvaitavana,
<div n="lb">Balarāma met the sages, bathed in Dvaitavana
<div n="lb">lake (not named) and then proceeded along
<div n="lb">the southern bank of the Sarasvatī 9. 36.
<div n="lb">26-28.
