{@A.@} Founding and explanation of the
name: The city was founded by king
Hastin, the son of Suhotra and Suvarṇā;
that is why the city is called Hāstinapura

Delightful ({%ramya%}) 1. 94. 10; the best
city ({%nagarottama%}) 13. 153. 5; praised
as the best among towns ({%tato nirvacanaṃ%}

comparable with the city of Indra ({%puran-%}
{%darapuropama%}) 1. 94. 38; the houses in
Hāstinapura looked like white mountains

cription of the town on specific occasions:
(1) On the arrival of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna:
full of delighted people ({%saṃprahṛṣṭanarā-%}
{%kula%}) 14. 51. 24; (2) When the still-born
child, Parīkṣit, was brought back to life:
people decorated the town with heaps of
garlands; citizens beautified their houses
with small and big flags; the highways
were decorated with flowers; the city looked
bright and produced sound similar to the
tide of the ocean; owing to the sound of
dancing and singing of dancers the town
appeared like the residence of Vaiśravaṇa
(Kubera); the city's empty places were
filled with bards in thousands, accom-
[Page585-b+ 40]
panied by women; flags moving in the blow-
ing wind as if pointed out to the Kurus
the northern and the southern direction;
the high-placed king's officer then announc-
ed to the people enjoyment, all through the
night, in which ornaments of jewels were
to be displayed ({%alaṃcakruś ca mālyau-%}

(3) After the departure of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī, Kuntī and Vidura, the whole
town with its old men, women and child-
ren became cheerless, the town was as if
without any sound as at the end of a festival

The name of the city occurs in connection
with many important events; on various
occasions, however, Hāstinapura is referred
to simply by words such as {%nagara%} or {%pura%}
(in the following listing references of this
type where the city is not directly named
are likely to be incomplete) (1) Jana-
mejaya, son of Parikṣit, after the comple-
tion of his {%satra%} at Kurukṣetra, returned

curiosity ({%kautūhalena nagaraṃ dīryamā-%}

whole town (following them), entered their
houses ({%sarveṇa nagareṇa te/samāviśanta%}

While going to the forest Draupadī said
that fourteen years later the Kuru women,
with their hair loose, will enter Gajāhvaya

husbands ({%muktakeśyo … evaṃ kṛtodakā%}

Vidura, Kuntī, and friends would still be
in the town Nāgasāhvaya ({%nagare nāgasāh-%}

told Vidura that he would no more want
him (for consultations) to protect the
earth or the city (Hāstinapura) ({%mahīm%}

tinapura even though he had heard about
the dice game ({%yenāhaṃ nāgamaṃ tadā/%}
{%śrutvaiva hāstinapuram dyūtam%}) 3. 15. 22

the game; but earlier he said that he knew
nothing about it 3. 14. 2, 14-16); (30)
Bhīma urged Yudhiṣṭhira to attack Gaja-
sāhvya with his brothers ({%tvaramāṇo 'bhi-%}

should go to Vāraṇasāhvaya and kill the
Kauravas ({%gatvā vāraṇasāhvayam%}) 3. 150. 8;
[Page588-b+ 40]
(34) Kṛṣṇa told Yudhiṣṭhira that after the
fulfilment of the contract ({%samaya%}), let
Nāgapura await his arrival, for he was
sure to get back Nāgapura and the whole
kingdom ({%pratīkṣatāṃ nāgapuraṃ bhavan-%}

(Hāstinapura) ({%jagāma nagaraṃ prati%}) 3.
235. 23; ({%svapuraṃ prayayau rājā%}) 3. 236. 6;
Janamejaya felt that Duryodhana, proud
as he was, must have found it difficult to
enter Hāstinapura ({%nityāhaṃkāravādinaḥ/%}
{%praveśo hāstinapure duṣkaraḥ pratibhāti%}

unto death ({%iha prāyam upāsiṣye%}) and not
return to the town; he asked his brothers,
led by Duḥśāsana, to return to the town

({%na hy ahaṃ pratiyāsyāmi puraṃ śatrunirā-%}

({%vāraṇāhvayam āsādya kiṃ vakṣyāmi janā-%}

Janamejaya, Vaiśaṃpāyana told him what
happened after Duryodhana's return to
Hāstinapura ({%āgate hāstinapuram%}) 3. 241.
1, 3; (38) Kings of different countries and
Brāhmaṇas arrived at Dhārtarāṣṭrapura
to attend Duryodhan's Vaiṣṇava sacrifice
({%ājagmuḥ … dhārtarāṣṭrapuraṃ prati%}) 3.
242. 17; after the completion of the Vaiṣṇava
sacrifice (3. 241. 32), Duryodhana entered
Hāstinapura 3. 242. 24; joyful, he entered
the town ({%praviveśa puraṃ hṛṣṭaḥ%}) 3. 243.

out in search of the Pāṇḍavas, returned to
Nāgapura ({%nyavartanta te ca nāgapuraṃ%}
[Page589-a+ 40]

the cattle of Virāṭa, Duryodhana, if challen-
ged, was prepared to fight even with Indra
and Yama, but not return to Hāstinapura
without fighting out with them ({%ko hāstina-%}
{%puraṃ vrajet%}) 4. 42. 18; (41) Aśvatthā-

Purohita of Drupada went on behalf of the
Pāṇḍavas (5. 5. 7, 18) to Nāgasāhvaya

(44) There was not enough space in Hās-
tinapura even for the principal kings and
their chief warriors who came to help Duryo-
dhana ({%na hāstinapure rājann avakāśo 'bha-%}

with the Pāṇḍavas, Saṃjaya returned to
Hāstinapura and quickly reported his arrival
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra ({%saṃprāpya hāstinapuram%})
5. 32. 2; (46) When Kṛṣṇa started for
Hāstinapura, strong, noisy, south-westernly
wind swept the town ({%prāmathnād dhāsti-%}
{%napuraṃ vāto dakṣiṇapaścimaḥ%}) 5. 82. 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra had ordered that the maidens
who would go out of the town to see
Kṛṣṇa would go without wearing the upper
garment ({%nagarād api yāḥ kāścid gamiṣya-%}

ward to see Kṛṣṇa; flags, big and small
({%mahādhvajapatākāś ca%}), were to be put up
in all directions and Kṛṣṇa's path was to be
sprinkled with water and freed from dust
[Page589-b+ 40]
5. 84. 16-18; Kṛṣṇa's visit to the town
Nāgasāhvaya to seek peace is referred to in
the list of the contents of the Udyogapar-

Returning from Hāstinapura to Upapla-
vya, Kṛṣṇa reported to the Pāṇḍavas all
that had happened in his meeting with the
Kauravas ({%āgamya hāstinapurād upapla-%}
