mountain that he did not do it at his own
will, but that was the course laid down by the
Creator; when the sun did not oblige, Vindhya,
angered, began to grow and obstructed the
path of the sun and the moon; the gods tried to
stop him from growing but Vindhya did not
stop; the gods then approached Agastya and
told him that Vindhya, under the influence of
anger, was covering the path of the luminaries;
they added that no one else except the sage was
able to dissuade the mountain; hearing that

Agastya, in the company of his wife, appro-
ached Vindhya and told him that he wanted
to go to the south on some purpose; he asked
the mountain to wait for his return and grow
again as desired after he returned; Agastya
made this contract with Vindhya but never re-
turned from the south; Vindhya was thus made
to stop growing due to the power of Agastya
