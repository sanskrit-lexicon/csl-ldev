{@Dasyu@}¦ m. (pl.): Designation of a
class of people following a mode of life not
approved by the law-makers; sometimes
(especially in the Śāntiparvan) the term
designates robbers; they moved in groups,
hence sometimes referred to as {%dasyugaṇa.%}

in the unlawful way was choosing the
{%dharma%} of Dasyus 7. 131. 2; (2) By referr-
ing to the unlawful and dangerous acts of
Dasyus: (i) Yavanas, Kirātas and others,
though they lived in towns, followed the
way of Dasyus ({%sarve te dasyujīvinaḥ%}) 12.

who did not want to give up his sons and
grandsons, live when the {%dharma%} was at
its lowest ebb, when all means of sub-
sistence were under the control of Dasyus
({%sarvasmin dasyusādbhūte pṛthivyām upa-%}

men since old times thinking ‘they have
wealth’; they torture men inflicting on
them various punishments and always
distress them ({%dhanam asyeti puruṣaṃ%}
{%purā nighnanti dasyavaḥ%}) 12. 171. 36; (v)
As good men do not take what belongs
to others, so do Dasyus not practise
non-violence; people are pleased with
Dasyus if they observe restraint ({%yathā%}

his wealth, leaving him without any posse-
ssions ({%niḥśeṣakaraṇaṃ tathā%}), robbing
women, coersion ({%paristhānam%} cf. Critical
Notes Vol. 14. p. 932), all this is practised
by Dasyus and is censurable; and even
if a Dasyu does not practise such acts,
he is all the same a Dasyu ({%dasyuṣv etad%}

of a Dasyu is considered wretched ({%prākṛto%}
{%vadha ucyate%}) and is equated with death
[Page746-a+ 40]
due to poison, hanging, or burns, or
due to getting killed by animals having
jaws 12. 286. 25 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 297.

{%raṇa%} cf. {%yogī atyantavyādhipīḍāgrasto 'pi%}

Dasyus are the limit; (1) even Dasyus
do not trust in those who act merci-
lessly ({%dasyavo 'py upaśaṅkante niranu-%}
{%krośakāriṇaḥ%}) 12. 131. 11; (2) even
Dasyus trust ascetics ({%tāpaseṣu hi viśvā-%}
{%sam api kurvanti dasyavaḥ%}) 12. 87. 28;
(3) The Rākṣasas refused to eat the flesh
of the mean Gautama, and suggested that
it might be distributed among the Dasyus;
but even Dasyus did not wish to eat
the flesh of the sinful and unfaithful
Gautama, nor the beasts of prey 12. 166.
18-19, 22-23; (ix) Dasyus are equated
with impious men; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Pāṇḍu and Vidura were born, there were
no Dasyus in the Kuru land, nor other
impious men ({%nābhavan dasyavaḥ kecin%}
{%nādharmarucayo janāḥ%}) 1. 102. 5; (x) If
Brāhmaṇas parted company with Kṣatri-
yas, the latter became degraded and were
as good as Dasyus ({%apadhvastā dasyu-%}
{%bhūtā bhavanti ye brāhmaṇāḥ kṣatriyān%}
{%saṃtyajanti%}) 12. 74. 10. {@E.@} The Duties
of Dasyus: On being questioned by
Māndhātṛ about the {%dharma%} of Dasyus
({%kathaṃ dharmaṃ careyus te%} 12. 65. 15),
Indra told him in details the duties of
Dasyus which included service ({%śuṣrūṣā%})
to parents, teachers, elders, ascetics and
kings, gifts to twice-born, observance of
non-violence, truth, purity, faithfulness
and other virtues 12. 65. 17-22; a Dasyu
who lived within limits did not perish
after his death; this is illustrated by
[Page746-b+ 40]
the narrative of Kāpavya; those Dasyus
who observed their {%dharma%} achieved
perfections ({%api te dasyavo bhūtvā kṣi-%}
{%praṃ siddhim avāpnuyuḥ%}) 12. 133. 1-22.
{@F.@} Limitations of Dasyus: They are not
able to overpower a person who has no
desires and one who is free from (the fear
of) loss of wealth ({%na ca dasyavaḥ/%}
{%prabhavanti dhanajyāninirmuktasya nirā-%}
{%śiṣaḥ%}) 12. 170. 12. {@G.@} King's relationship
with Dasyus: Indra created for a king
his duty and armour, weapon and bow, for
killing Dasyus ({%indreṇedaṃ dasyuvadhāya%}
{%karma utpāditaṃ varma śastraṃ dhanuś%}
{%ca%}) 5. 29. 27 (But Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 29.
30: {%karma yuddhaṃ%}); Brahman created
Kṣatriyas for killing Dasyus who obstruct-
ed those that were engaged in agriculture,
cattle-care, trade, and also those who
performed the duties of Hotṛ, Adhvaryu
and Udgātṛ priests ({%ūrdhvaṃ caiva trayī%}
{%vidyā%}) 12. 90. 7-8 (Nī., however, on Bom.
Ed. 12. 89. 7: {%ūrdhvaṃ svargam%}); a
Kṣatriya should always be ready to kill
Dasyus in battles 12. 60. 14; for a king,
there is no higher duty than destroying
Dasyus 12. 60. 17; their absence, (as
also of beggars), in a kingdom considered
desirable 12. 89. 20; a king should take
his subjects into confidence by drawing
their attention to the danger posed by
his enemies who collaborated with Dasyus
12. 88. 26; a king must protect all the
{%varṇas%} if the Dasyus tried to plunder
their wives and possessions 13. 47. 44; a
king who saved the beings from Dasyus
and gave them wealth and happiness
was a great king ({%dasyubhyaḥ prāṇadānāt%}
{%sa dhanadaḥ sukhado virāṭ%}) 12. 98. 8; if
a king did not protect his subjects, they
[Page747-a+ 40]
could be at the mercy of Dasyus ({%loko%}

Bom. Ed. 12. 68. 20: {%dasyusāt corādhī-%}
{%nāḥ%}); if due to a king's negligence his
subjects were being robbed, such a king
was Kali 12. 12. 27; Yudhiṣṭhira wanted
to know if there were boundaries beyond
which he should not allow Dasyus to
step ({%asti svid dasyumaryādā yām ahaṃ%}

12. 142. 1: {%dasyūnām akāryakāriṇām api%}
{%maryādā kācid asti ito 'dhikaṃ dasyūnāṃ na%}
{%kartavyam iti%}); when a king behaved dis-
regarding all restraints and in such a state
Dasyus brought about total confusion, then
if all {%varṇas%} took up weapons (to protect
themselves) no blemish attached to them
({%unmaryāde pravṛtte tu dasyubhiḥ saṃkare%}
{%kṛte/sarve varṇā na duṣyeyuḥ śastra-%}
{%vanto … %}) 12. 79. 18; if the power of Dasyus
increased ({%abhyutthite dasyubale%}), then
even a Brāhmaṇa, Vaiśya or Śūdra should
hold the rod of punishment in hand and
protect the subjects from Dasyus; any
one, Śūdra or some one else, whom the
subjects, when tortured by Dasyus, turned
for protection should be honoured (12.
79. 34-35, 38); a king in whose dominion
hordes of Dasyus freely plundered the posse-
ssions of others, as do crows the fishes
in water, was contemptible among the
Kṣatriyas ({%sa vai kṣatriyapāṃsanaḥ%}) 12.

which has no ruler and which is weak ({%ani-%}

churned (because the pot was empty)

Bom. Ed. 12. 73. 7: {%anu paścāt prakāśamā-%}
{%naṃ balam anvagbalaṃ yathā syāt tathā%});
a king might take away the wealth of Dasyus
(and of those who did not perform sacri-
fices) 12. 134. 2; a king should always
kill Dasyus and should not pardon any
one on any account ({%nihanyāt sarvato%}
{%dasyūn na kāmāt kasyacit kṣamet%}) 12. 76.
5; Dyumatsena told Satyavant that if
Dasyus were not awarded capital punish-
ment, there would be chaos everywhere;
in the Kali age, one would say: ‘this was
mine, not his’ and normal life would be
impossible ({%lokayātrā na caiva syāt%}) 12.

267. 6: {%lokayātrā tīrthagamanavāṇijyā-%}
{%divyavahāraḥ kalau yuge adharmapra-%}

careful while giving capital punishment to
Dasyus, because when a Dasyu died, many
other innocents dependent on him, like
his wife, mother, father, son, also got
killed for no fault of theirs ({%rājā tasmāṭ%}
[Page748-a+ 40]

times, if a king had to take resort to a

forest and live with Dasyus he should
not associate with Dasyus who threw
all norms of behaviour to the winds;
it was easy to raise an army of Dasyus

Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya whether the
Kauravas, if they encountered the bands

(3) Arjuna told Saṃjaya that when he
would scatter the hordes of Dasyus gather-
ed for the battle, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and his
sons would repent 5. 47. 59; (4) On the
fourteenth day of war, Sātyaki covered
the earth with the shaven heads of Dasyus
together with their headgears 7. 95. 40; he
killed many Dasyus 7. 97. 20; (5) Kṛṣṇa

so that they were not attacked by Dasyus
due to their greed for wealth ({%naitā hiṃ-%}

When Arjuna stopped at Pañcanada on his
way to Hāstinapura with Vṛṣṇi women,
Dasyus became greedy and took counsel
among themselves; then, thousands of
them, using sticks as weapons, attacked
Vṛṣṇis desirous of looting property; they
disregarded Arjuna's warning and continued
their attack; Arjuna could not check them
as he forgot his {%astras;%} the Vṛṣṇi warriors
could not stop Dasyus running away with
Vṛṣṇi women; Arjuna and the Vṛṣṇi
warriors killed some of the plundering
Dasyus with arrows; when Arjuna's arrows
were exhausted, he killed Dasyus with the
tip of his bow; but that was of no avail;
before his very eyes, Dasyus ({%mlecchas%})
took away Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka women 16.

(6) In order to illustrate that a Dasyu,
who observed proper limits, did not perish
after death ({%yathā dasyuḥ samaryādaḥ%}
{%pretyabhāve na naśyati%}) is told the story
of Kāpavya; he was born of a Niṣādī by a
Kṣatriya; he obtained perfection on account
of his being a (good) Dasyu (since he
lived righteously carrying out the duties
of a Kṣatriya) ({%dasyutvāt siddhim āptavān%});
when the Brāhmaṇas, who had retired to
a forest, did not accept food brought to
them by Kāpavya because he was a Dasyu,
he left some of it in their homes and went
away early in the morning; many Dasyus
who behaved cruelly disregarding the rules
elected Kāpavya as their leader; they
agreed to live as instructed by him and
requested him to act as their father
and mother; he taught them the way they

Gautama by name, happened to take
shelter in the house of a wealthy Dasyu
who was truthful and generous; Gautama
got from the Dasyu new garments and
wife; he lived there happily and helped the
Dasyu to maintain his family; like the
Dasyus, Gautama began to kill geese
({%vakrāṅgān%}) with arrows (Nī. who reads
{%cakrāṅgān%} explains it as {%haṃsān,%} Bom. Ed.
12. 168. 36): the Brāhmaṇa Gautama, due
to contact with Dasyus and leading their
life, became similar to them ({%dasyubhiḥ%}
{%samatām iyāt%}); many months passed while
Gautama lived happily in the settlement of
the Dasyus ({%dasyugrāme%}) killing many
birds ({%pakṣiṇaḥ%}); once another Brāhmaṇa
happened to arrive in that settlement of the
Dasyus ({%dasyugrāmam%}); in that settlement
which was full of Dasyus ({%grāme dasyu-%}
{%janākīrṇe%}) he searched everywhere for a
Brāhmaṇa; he entered the house where
Gautama lived; he recognized that Gautama
belonged to Madhyadeśa; he asked Gau-
tama how he came to live like a Dasyu
