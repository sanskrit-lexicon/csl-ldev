Name (?) of a dialogue between Vidurā and
her son (Saṃjaya) 5. 131. 1.
<div n="P">Described as old Itihāsa ({%itihāsaṃ purā-%}
{%tanam%}) 5. 131. 1; the Itihāsa is of the type
of Jaya ({%jayo nāmetihāso 'yam%}) 5. 134. 17;
it contains what is beneficial (for a king)
and what leads to his prosperity ({%atra śreyaś%}
{%ca bhūyaś ca%}) 5. 131. 2; it is a powerful
exhortation, best calculated to raise the spirits
(of a king); a minister should narrate it to
his king who is sinking (in spirits) and is
oppressed by enemies ({%idam uddharṣaṇaṃ%}
{%bhīmaṃ tejovardhanam uttamam/rājānaṃ%}
{%śrāvayen mantrī sīdantanṃ śatrupīḍitam//%})
5. 134. 16; in it Vidurā, the queen mother,
instructed her dejected son Saṃjaya regar-
ing the duties of a Kṣatriya and exhorted
him to rise up and fight with his enemies to
get back the lost kingdom; Kuntī told it to
Kṛṣṇa and wanted him to report it to her
sons; the narrative is contained in the
{%adhyāyas%} 5. 131-134; alluded to in 15. 22.
20; 15. 23. 1-18 (esp. 14, 18). [See {@Jaya@}]
