{@Sāvitrī<sup>1</sup>@}¦ f.: Name of a {%mantra%} (ṚV,
3. 62. 10) so called because it is related to
god Savitṛ; also called Gāyatrī (3. 83. 27:
6. 5. 18-19) because the {%mantra%} is composed
in the Gāyatrī metre.
{@A.@} Description: holy ({%puṇyā%}) 6. 5. 18;
best ({%uttamā%}) 13. 145. 27; having all quali-
ties ({%sarvaguṇānvitā%}) 6. 5. 18; enabling the
reciter to get over difficult situations ({%durga-%}
{%taraṇī%}) 2. 11. 25; highly honoured in the
worlds ({%lokasaṃmatā%}) 6. 5. 18. {@B.@} Im-
portance and significance: Sāvitrī was con-
sidered to be the beginning of all sciences
({%ādir iṣyate/sāvitrī sarvavidyānām%}) 14.
44. 4-5; the nineteen classes of beings (7
{%grāmya paśus,%} 7 {%āraṇya paśus,%} 5 {%ud-%}
{%bhijjas%}) and the five {%mahābhūtas,%} which
make a total of twenty-four are identi-
fied with (the twenty-four syllables of) the
Gāyatrī ({%eṣāṃ viṃśatir ekonā mahābhūteṣu%}
{%pañcasu/caturviṃśatir uddiṣṭā gāyatrī%}
{%lokasaṃmatā//%}) 6. 5. 15-18. {@C.@} Its
close association with the Vedas used for
a simile: As the Sāvitrī {%mantra%} does not
forsake the Vedas, so did Yājñasenī (Drau-
padī) not forsake the Pāṇḍavas 3. 80. 4.
{@D.@} Relationship with deities: (1) Savitṛ:
Sāvitrī was (first) pronounced in the east by
god Savitṛ to the {%brahmavādins%} 5. 106. 10;
3. 110. 5 ({%? sāvitrīṃ savitā yathā (dadau)%});
(2) Nārāyaṇa: On the Śveta Dvīpa, Nārada
saw {%oṃkāra,%} followed by Sāvitrī, coming out
of the mouth of Nārāyaṇa 12. 326. 7; (3)
[Page219-a+ 40]
Śiva: when Rudra got ready to destroy the
Tripuras he made the Vedas his bow and the
Sāvitrī {%mantra%} his bow-string 13 145. 27;
{@E.@} Personification: (1) Sāvitrī, in bodily
form, present in the Sabhā of Brahmadeva 2.
11. 25; Sāvitrī, along with the Vedas and the
Upaniṣads attended the sacrifice of Śiva when
he had assumed the form of Varuṇa 13. 85. 6.
{@F.@} Uses: (1) In {%śrāddha:%} One should atten-
tively recite the Sāvitrī prayer at each oblation
given to the manes at the {%śrāddha (brūyāc%}
{%chrāddhe ca sāvitrīṃ piṇḍe piṇḍe samā-%}
{%hitaḥ)%} 13. 92. 14; (cf. Śāṅkh Gṛ. Sū. 4. 1. 8
for a slightly different use: {%bhuñjāneṣu%}
{%mahāvyāhṛtīḥ sāvitrīm madhuvātīyāḥ pitṛ-%}
{%devatyāḥ pāvamānīś ca japet%}); (2) for use
as a test (?): If a person born of a mixture of
castes recites Gāyatrī at the renowned {%tīrtha%}
called Gāyatryāḥ sthānam it sounds like a
{%gāthā%} (a non-Vedic stanza) or an ordinary
song. This was a direct proof available for a
Brāhmaṇa to prove that he was not of mixed
origin ({%nidarśanaṃ ca pratyakṣaṃ brāh-%}
{%maṇānāṃ narādhipa/gāyatrīṃ paṭhate yas%}
{%tu yonisaṃkarajas tathā/gāthā vā gītikā%}
{%vāpi tasya saṃpadyate nṛpa//%} Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 3. 85. 29: {%nidarśānam udā-%}
{%haraṇam%}); (3) As a benediction: Jāmbavatī
invoked Sāvitrī mantra for the protection
of Kṛṣṇa when he set out for the Himavant
to meet Śiva ({%sāvitrī brahmavidyā ca ṛtavo%}
{%vatsarāḥ kṣapāḥ/ … rakṣantu sarvatra gataṃ%}
{%tvām yādava sukhāvaham//%} 13. 14. 22-23).
{@G.@} Qualifications and rewards obtained by
its knowledge and recitation: Brāhmaṇas who
know Sāvitrī, so also the one who recites
Sāvitrī three times a day, are worthy of being
invited for a {%śrāddha (sāvitrījñāḥ kriyā-%}
{%vantas te rājan ketanakṣamāḥ)%} 13. 24. 25,
({%sāvitrīṃ japate yas tu trikālam … sa rājan%}
[Page219-b+ 38]
{%ketanakṣamaḥ%}) 13. 24. 28; one who recites
Sāvitrī on a sacred spot, eating limited food,
not injuring others, alert ({%? amandakaḥ%}), not
talking to any one is freed of all sins 12. 36.
33 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 35. 37:
{%manda iva mandakaḥ rāgadveṣamānāpa-%}
{%mānaśūnyaḥ%}); one who knows the real nature
of Gāyatrī (i. e. the identification of its 24
syllables with 19 kinds of beings and 5
{%mahābhūtas%}) is never deprived of the world
due to him ({%ya etāṃ veda gāyatrīṃ … %}
{%tattvena bharataśreṣṭha sa lokān na praṇa-%}
{%śyati%}) 6. 5. 19. [See {@Sāvitrī<sup>2</sup>, Bhārata-@}
