{@Raudra@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people (?)
{@A.@} Location: Near the southern ocean
(see the Epic event). {@B.@} Epic event:
When Arjuna, accompanying the Aśva-
medha horse, reached the southern ocean he
had to fight with Raudras and Māhiṣakas
along with others ({%prayayau bhūyo dakṣi-%}
{%ṇaṃ salilārṇavam//tatrāpi … raudrair%}
{%māhiṣakair api/ … yuddham āsīt kirīṭi-%}
{%naḥ//%}) 14. 84. 10-11 (Is Raudra a proper
name, or does it mean ‘fierce’ and qualify
Māhiṣakas ?).
