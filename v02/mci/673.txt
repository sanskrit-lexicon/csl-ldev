{@Ṛṣivaṃśa@}¦ m.: Name of a passage in
the Anuśāsanaparvan listing the names of
sages and also of kings, some of whom are
royal sages ({%rājarṣi%}) 13. 151. 30-51.
[Page177-a+ 40]
<div n="P">The names of sages, rich in austerities,
who having practised austerities had attained
perfection ({%viprāṃs tapaḥsiddhāṃs tapodhi-%}
{%kān%} 13. 151. 30) are listed according to the
quarters they occupy: Yavakrīta, Raibhya,
Kakṣīvān and some others in the east;
Ulmucu, Pramucu, Mumucu and some
others in the south; Uṣadgu and his brothers,
Parivyādha, Dīrghatamas and some others
in the west; Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Śakti and some
others in the north 13. 151. 31-40; the
recitation of the Ṛṣivaṃśa, along with that
of the Daivatavaṃśa, at two twilights is
very effective in removing sins ({%dvisaṃ-%}
{%dhyaṃ paṭhitaḥ putra kalmaṣāpaharaḥ%}
{%paraḥ%}) 13. 151. 2; ({%kīrtitān … sarvapāpapra-%}
{%mocanān%}) 13. 151. 30; then follow names of
kings beginning with Nṛga and ending with
Kakṣasena 13. 151. 41-50; some of these
kings are royal sages, viz. Mucakunda
({%rājarṣiḥ%}) 13. 151. 46; Śveta ({%rājarṣisat-%}
{%tamaḥ%}) 13. 151. 47, Kṣupa ({%rājarṣiḥ%}) 13.
151. 48, Nala ({%rājarṣiḥ%}) 13. 151. 49, and
Kakṣasena ({%rājarṣiḥ%}) 13. 151. 50; the list
is apparently intended to be recited by one
who does not wish to meet with difficulties, nor
incur sin, nor encounter enemies, and by one
who wishes to have sure victory and great
happiness after death ({%mā vighnaṃ mā%}
{%ca me pāpaṃ mā ca me paripanthinaḥ/%}
{%dhruvo jayo me nityaṃ syāt paratra ca parā%}
{%gatiḥ%}) 13. 151. 51.
