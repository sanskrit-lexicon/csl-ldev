<div n="lb">of a reed’ ({%śaraprasūnasaṃkāśa%} 12. 136.
<div n="lb">30), mobile, and having red eyes; when the
<div n="lb">mouse Palita was tasting the piece of flesh,
<div n="lb">he saw below his deadly enemy, the ichneumon
<div n="lb">Harika, lying in the crevice of the earth;
<div n="lb">the ichneumon came out quickly as he got
<div n="lb">the scent of the mouse, looked up, and
<div n="lb">licked his mouth for food 12. 136. 30-31;
[Page084-b+ 38]
<div n="lb">(the mouse also noticed Candraka an owl,
<div n="lb">his another enemy, up in the nest on the
<div n="lb">branch of the tree 12. 136. 32); the mouse
<div n="lb">thus faced danger from the ichneumon and
<div n="lb">the owl at the same time; he realized that
<div n="lb">Harika would catch him if he rushed to the
<div n="lb">ground to save himself from the owl 12.
<div n="lb">136. 33, 37; the mouse therefore decided to
<div n="lb">take refuge with the cat, his third enemy,
<div n="lb">who was trapped in the net; the mouse pointed
<div n="lb">out to the cat the danger he was facing
<div n="lb">owing to the evil intention of the ichneumon
<div n="lb">and the owl; he offered to cut the threads of
<div n="lb">the trap in which the cat was caught provided
<div n="lb">the cat offered him protection from Harika
<div n="lb">and Candraka 12. 136. 72-73; the cat agreed
<div n="lb">and when Harika and Candraka saw the
<div n="lb">mouse confidently resting on the body of the
<div n="lb">cat, they lost hopes of getting the mouse and
<div n="lb">returned to their respective homes 12. 136. 82.
