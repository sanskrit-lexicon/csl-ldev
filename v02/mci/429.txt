of a reed’ ({%śaraprasūnasaṃkāśa%} 12. 136.
30), mobile, and having red eyes; when the
mouse Palita was tasting the piece of flesh,
he saw below his deadly enemy, the ichneumon
Harika, lying in the crevice of the earth;
the ichneumon came out quickly as he got
the scent of the mouse, looked up, and
licked his mouth for food 12. 136. 30-31;
[Page084-b+ 38]
(the mouse also noticed Candraka an owl,
his another enemy, up in the nest on the
branch of the tree 12. 136. 32); the mouse
thus faced danger from the ichneumon and
the owl at the same time; he realized that
Harika would catch him if he rushed to the
ground to save himself from the owl 12.
136. 33, 37; the mouse therefore decided to
take refuge with the cat, his third enemy,
who was trapped in the net; the mouse pointed
out to the cat the danger he was facing
owing to the evil intention of the ichneumon
and the owl; he offered to cut the threads of
the trap in which the cat was caught provided
the cat offered him protection from Harika
and Candraka 12. 136. 72-73; the cat agreed
and when Harika and Candraka saw the
mouse confidently resting on the body of the
cat, they lost hopes of getting the mouse and
returned to their respective homes 12. 136. 82.
