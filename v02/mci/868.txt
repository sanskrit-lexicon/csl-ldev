{@Kṛta, Kṛtayuga@}¦ nt.: Name of the first
among the four Yugas; also called {@Devayuga@}
(1. 14. 5; 2. 11. 1; 3. 92. 6; 10. 18. 1; 12.
3. 19; 13. 82. 24, {@Ādiyuga@} (6. 76. 18; 13.
135. 11), {@Prājāpatyayuga@} (12. 113. 4), and
{@Dharmayuga@} (12. 308. 7).
{@A.@} Description: Auspicious ({%śubha%})
1. 14. 5; 12. 336. 31; completely free from
the three {%guṇas%} ({%sattva, rajas%} and {%tamas%}),
({%traiguṇyaparivarjita%}) 13. 148. 22; the best
period ({%śreṣṭhaḥ kālaḥ%}) 5. 130. 14; 12.
324. 5; 12. 327. 73; the best among the
Yugas ({%yugottama%}) 13. 148. 11. {@B.@} Place
among the Yugas: When Brahmā created
the worlds, the first Yuga to occur was the
[Page239-a+ 40]
Kṛta ({%tataḥ prāvartata tadā ādau kṛta-%}
{%yugaṃ śubham%}) 12. 336. 31; 6. 11. 4; 14.
44. 8; first Yuga after the dissolution of the
entire world ({%āditaḥ manujavyāghra kṛt-%}
{%snasya jagataḥ kṣaye … tato kṛtaṃ yugaṃ%})
3. 186. 17-18; hence called {%ādiyuga%} and
{%prathamakalpita%} 12. 322. 51; hence also the
words {%ādau%} and {%purā%} (or {%pūrvam%}) often
used with Kṛta (12. 59. 13; 12. 336. 31,
and many other citations in section {@D@}
below); Kṛta sets in again at the end of
the fourth Kali Yuga; Yudhiṣṭhira asked
Mārkaṇḍeya what would be the (final)
stage of Kali when its end will have arrived
and after which Kṛta will commence again
({%yugakṣaye//kāṃ ca kāṣṭhāṃ samā-%}
{%sādya punaḥ saṃpatsyate kṛtam%}) 3. 188.
6-7; 3. 186. 22. {@C.@} Duration: Mārka-
ṇḍedya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the duration of
the Kṛta Yuga was 4000 years; it had dawns
of 400 years and twilights of the same
duration ({%catvāry āhuḥ sahasrāṇi varṣāṇāṃ%}
{%tat kṛtaṃ yugam/tasya tāvacchatī saṃdhyā%}
{%saṃdhyāṃśaś ca tataḥ param//%}) 3. 186.
18 (cf. Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 188. 23 above
{@Kali,@} section {@C,@} p. 234); the same duration
of Kṛta told by Vyāsa to Śuka 12. 224.
18-19. {@D.@} Events occurring in the Kṛta
Yuga: (1) All beings are produced from
Viṣṇu at the advent of the Kṛta Yuga and
are reabsorbed into him at the end of that
Yuga 13. 135. 11; (2) The creation of the
world, the creation of Saṃkarṣaṇa, Prad-
yumna, Aniruddha and Brahman, Nārāyaṇa's
incarnation as Varāha to reestablish the earth
and kill Hiraṇyākṣa, as Nṛsiṃha to kill
Hiraṇyakaśipu, and as Vāmana to make
Bali a resident of Pātāla—all these events
are said to have occurred in the Kṛta Yuga
which is not named 12. 326. 67-76; (also
[Page239-b+ 40]
cf. 12. 337. 29-36 where these three incarna-
tions are mentioned without naming Kṛta-
yuga); (3) Formerly, in the Kṛta Yuga
of the Svāyaṃbhuva Manvantara, Nārā-
yaṇa was born as Nara, Nārāyaṇa, Hari
and Kṛṣṇa ({%nārāyaṇo hi viśvātmā catur-%}

{%hariḥ kṛṣṇas tathaiva ca//%}) 12. 321. 8-9;
(4) In the Devayuga when the Daityendras
ruled the three worlds Viṣṇu entered the
womb of Aditi ({%purā devayuge tāta … %}) 13.
82. 24-25; (5) In the Devayuga Prajā-
pati had two daughters ({%purā devayuge … %})
1. 14. 5 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 16. 5: {%deva-%}
{%yuge satyayuge%}); (6) In the Kṛta Yuga
all gods approached Varuṇa and requested
him to be the ruler of waters 9. 46. 5-6;
(7) In the Devayuga, Āditya came down
from the heaven to visit the world of mortals
when he met Nārada ({%purā devayuge%}
{%rājan … %}) 2. 11. 1; (8) In one of the past
Devayugas, the gods, desirous of giving
offerings, arranged the sacrifice following the
prescriptions of the Vedas ({%tato devayuge%}
{%'tīte devā vai samakalpayan/yajñam veda-%}
{%pramāṇena vidhivad yaṣṭum īpsavaḥ%}) 10.
18. 1; (9) Lomaśa told Yudhiṣṭhira that
formerly in the Devayuga he had seen that
the gods liked the {%dharma%} and the Asuras
deserted it ({%purā devayuge caiva dṛṣṭaṃ%}
{%sarvaṃ mayā vibho/arocayan surā dhar-%}
{%maṃ dharmaṃ tatyajire 'surāḥ%}) 3. 92. 6;
(10) Gods and demons churned the ocean
in the Ādiyuga 6. 76. 18; (11) There were
fierce Dānavas, known as Kāleyas, in the
Kṛta Yuga 3. 98. 3; (12) Asura Gṛtsa
carried away the wife of Bhṛgu in the Deva-
yuga ({%purā devayuge tāta … %}) 12. 3. 19;
[Page240-a+ 40]
(13) In the Kṛta Yuga Manu held the
{%daṇḍa (āsīt kṛtayuge pūrvaṃ manur%}
{%daṇḍadharaḥ prabhuḥ)%} 14. 4. 2; (14)
God Nārāyaṇa told the seven sages (12. 322.
27, 31) that the {%anuśāsana%} promulgated by
him and the {%śāstra,%} together with the {%aṅgas%}
and the Upaniṣad, will be established by
them in Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa in the Kṛta Yuga
(not directly named) ({%utpanne 'ṅgirase caiva%}
{%yuge prathamakalpite/sāṅgopaniṣadaṃ%}
{%śāstraṃ sthāpayitvā bṛhaspatau%}) 12. 322.
51; (15) In the Kṛta there was a famous
sage Taṇḍi who, as a devotee, propitiated
god for ten thousand years by practising
{%samādhi%} 13. 16. 12; (16) Formerly in the
the Kṛta Yuga an excellent Brāhmaṇa called
Ārṣṭiṣeṇa lived in a {%gurukula;%} he studied
diligently, but could not complete the study
of either the {%vidyās%} or the Vedas ({%purā%}
{%kṛtayuge … %}) 9. 39. 3-4; (17) Formerly in
the Kṛta Yuga there lived a king Avikam-
paka who was overpowered in battle by
enemies ({%purā kṛtayuge tāta … %}) 12. 248. 7;
(18) In the Kṛta Yuga there was a famous
sage Sāvarṇi who practised austerities for
six thousand years to satisfy Rudra 13.
14. 70; (19) Formerly in the Kṛta
Yuga there was a sage Vyāghrapāda who
was versed in the Vedas and the Vedāṅgas
({%purā kṛtayuge tāta … %}) 13. 14. 75;
(20) In the Dharmayuga, when Janaka
ruled Mithilā, a certain {%bhikṣukī%} called
Sulabhā roamed alone on the earth 12. 308.
7; (21) In the Prājāpatyayuga (i. e. the
Kṛtayuga) there once lived a large camel
who remembered his previous lives ({%jātis-%}
{%maraḥ%}); he observed scrupulously the vows
and practised severe austerities in a forest
12. 113. 4; (22) Formerly in the Kṛta
Yuga a Rākṣasa called Cārvāka practised
[Page240-b+ 40]
austerities in the Badarī Āśrama and was
blessed with a boon by Brahman ({%purā%}
{%kṛtayuge … %}) 12. 39. 39; (23) Nārāyaṇa
told Nārada that formerly in the Kṛta Yuga
when the Veda and the {%śruti%} were lost, he
retrieved them and (the worlds) were again
supplied with the Vedas and the {%śrutis (?)%}
{%(yadā vedaśrutir naṣṭā mayā pratyāhṛtā%}
{%purā/savedāḥ saśrutīkāś ca kṛtāḥ pūrvaṃ%}
{%kṛte yuge//%}) 12. 326. 94; (24) Formerly,
during the second birth of Brahmā from the
eyes of Nārāyaṇa in the Kṛta Yuga, Rudra,
who received the {%dharma%} of the Ekāntins
from Soma and who practised {%yoga,%} taught
it to the Vālakhilyas ({% … purā kṛtayuge%}
{%nṛpa%}) 12. 336. 15-16; the practice of the
{%dharma%} of the Ekāntins formed such an
important characteristic of the Kṛta Yuga
that if in any other Yuga the world became
full of the Ekāntins that would mean the
advent of the Kṛta Yuga—this is what
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya ({%yady ekān-%}
{%tibhir ākīrṇaṃ jagat syāt kurunandana/%}
{% … bhavet kṛtayugaprāptiḥ%}) 12. 336. 58;
(25) Hari-Nārāyaṇa told Brahmā, born
for the fourth time from his ears (12. 336.
23), to learn the Sātvata Dharma, from
him and establish it in the Kṛta Yuga
12. 336. 27; this {%dharma%} was hence called
Kārtayugadharman 12. 336. 29; Brahmā, as
instructed by Nārāyaṇa, initiated first the
Kṛta Yuga and then the Sātvata {%dharma%}
spread among the people 12. 336. 31; (26)
In the fifth birth of Brahman from the nose
of Nārāyaṇa (12. 336. 36), at the beginning
of the Kṛtayuga, Prajāpati Vīraṇa learnt the
Sātvata Dharma from Sanatkumāra 12. 336.
37; (27) In the seventh birth of Brahman
from a lotus (12. 336. 44), Nārāyaṇa him-
self instructed Pitāmaba in the Sātvata
[Page241-a+ 40]
{%dharma%} at the beginning of the Kṛta Yuga
(not named) {%tatraiṣa dharmaḥ kathitaḥ%}
{%svayaṃ nārāyaṇena hi//pitāmahāya śud-%}
{%dhāya yugādau lokadhāriṇe%}) 12. 336.
44-45; (28) At the request of Yudhiṣṭhira
Bhīṣma told him how at the beginning,
in the Kṛta Yuga, a kingdom first came
into existence ({%yathā rājyaṃ samutpan-%}
{%nam ādau kṛtayuge 'bhavat%}) 12. 59. 13;
(29) Formerly in the Kṛta Yuga the ascetics
residing in the Naimiṣa forest were engaged
in a twelve-yearly sacrificial session ({%pūrvaṃ%}
{%kṛtayuge rājan … %}) 9. 36. 39. {@F.@} Nārāyaṇa
(Kṛṣṇa) and the Kṛta Yuga: Bhagavān
Nārāyaṇa (who was the same as Kṛṣṇa-
Janārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya
that his colour in the Kṛta Yuga was white
({%śvetaḥ kṛtayuge varṇaḥ%}) 3. 187. 31; Bhīṣma
told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was complete
Dharma in the Kṛta Yuga ({%kṛte yuge dharma%}
{%āsīt samagraḥ%}) 13. 143. 9. {@G.@} King and
the Kṛta Yuga: The king is the creator of
the Kṛta Yuga ({%rājā kṛtayugasraṣṭā%}) 5.
130. 16 = 12. 70. 25, (also cf. {%rājā kālasya%}
{%kāraṇam%} 12. 70. 6); Kṛta and the remaining
three Yugas depend on the conduct of the
king and hence the king is identical with
Yuga ({%rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva yugam%}
{%ucyate%}) 12. 92. 6; ({%rājamūlāni sarvāṇi%})
12. 139. 10; when the king fully followed
{%daṇḍanīti%} then prevailed the Kṛta Yuga, the
best of time ({%daṇḍanītyāṃ yadā rājā samyak%}
{%kārtsnyena vartate/tadā kṛtayugaṃ nāma%}
{%kālaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ pravartate//%}) 5. 130. 14 =
12. 70. 7; Dyumatsena told Satyavān that in
the Kṛta Yuga the king followed the instruc-
tion (how a king should rule 12. 259. 24-30)
as his primary principle ({%etat prathama-%}
{%kalpena rājā kṛtayuge 'bhajat%}) 12. 259. 32;
a king, as the creator of Kṛta, enjoyed in
[Page241-b+ 40]
the heaven endlessly ({%kṛtasya karaṇād rājā%}
{%svargam atyantam aśnute%}) 5. 130. 17 =
12. 70. 26; king Yayāti was described by
Aṣṭaka as the best among those born in the
Kṛta Yuga ({%kārtayugapradhāna%}) 1. 85. 1
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 90. 1: {%kārtayugapra-%}
{%dhāna/kṛtayuge bhavāḥ kārtayugāḥ/atya-%}
{%ntaniṣpāpā teṣāṃ mukhyatamety arthaḥ%}).
{@H.@} Kṛta and {%dharma:%} In the Kṛta Yuga
the ancient {%dharma%} prevails ({%yatra dharmaḥ%}
{%sanātanaḥ%}) 3. 148. 10; in that Yuga the eternal
{%dharma%} of the four {%varṇas%} stands on all its
four feet (i. e. is in no way deficient) ({%kṛte%}
{%yuge catuṣpādaś cāturvarṇyasya śāśvataḥ%})
3. 148. 21; formerly in the Kṛta Yuga Dharma,
the bull, without deceit and free from vices
stood established in its entirety among men
({%kṛte catuṣpāt sakalo nirvyājopādhivar-%}
{%jitaḥ/vṛṣaḥ pratiṣṭhito dharmo manuṣyeṣv%}
{%abhavat purā//%}) 3. 188. 10 (Nī. on 3.
190. 9: {%vṛṣa iva catuṣpāt%}); 12. 327. 73;
both {%dharma,%} on its four feet, and truth
are fully established in the Kṛta Yuga
({%catuṣpāt sakalo dharmaḥ satyaṃ caiva%}
{%kṛte yuge%}) 12. 224. 22; since {%dharma%} is not
contaminated by {%adharma%} ({%nādharmeṇā-%}
{%gamaḥ kaścit%} 12. 224. 22) it does not get
diminished ({%dharmo na hrasate kvacit%}) 1.
58. 22; {%dharma%} always prospers and {%adharma%}
is destroyed 3. 189. 7; 12. 70. 8; {%dharma%}
in the Kṛta Yuga was established among
the Brāhmaṇas who had mastered their self,
who had practised austerities and who had
studied the Vedas ({%ātmavatsu tapovatsu%}
{%śrutavaisu pratiṣṭhitaḥ%}) 12. 224. 67; {%dharma%}
in different Yugas is different 12. 224. 26 =
12. 252. 8; austerity is the best {%dharma%}
for the Kṛta ({%tapaḥ paraṃ kṛtayuge%}) 12.
24. 27; in the Kṛta Yuga the only {%dharma%}
is renunciation ({%dharmaḥ saṃnyāsa eva%}
[Page242-a+ 40]
{%ca%}) 3. 148. 13; one is not supposed to
get angry in the Kṛta Yuga ({%na roṣaṃ%}
{%kartum arhasi/naiṣa dharmaḥ kṛtayuge%}
{%yas tvaṃ roṣam acīkṛthāḥ%}) 12. 323. 17.
{@I.@} Kṛta and the sacrifice: In the Kṛta
Yuga performance of sacrifices is not pre-
scribed ({%tretāyuge vidhis tv eṣāṃ yajñā-%}
{%nāṃ na kṛte yuge%}) 12. 224. 62; the sages
who assembled for a sacrifice told gods who
wanted a goat to be killed that that was
not the {%dharma%} of good people; they reminded
the gods that they were in the Kṛta Yuga
when an animal was not offered ({%naiṣa%}
{%dharmaḥ satāṃ devā yatra vadhyeta vai%}
{%paśuḥ/idaṃ kṛtayugaṃ śreṣṭhaṃ kathaṃ%}
{%vadhyeta vai paśuḥ//%}) 12. 324. 5; ({%ahiṃsyā%}
{%yajñapaśavo yuge 'smin naitad anyathā%}) 12.
327. 73; the offerings offered by Brahman and
others to Viṣṇu in a Vaiṣṇava Kratu were
offered according to the prescriptions meant
for the Kṛta Yuga and, as a result, they reach-
ed the Puruṣa who had the brightness of the
sun and who was above darkness ({%te kārta-%}
{%yugadharmāṇo bhāgā paramasatkṛtāḥ/%}
{%prāpur ādityavarṇaṃ taṃ puruṣaṃ tamasaḥ%}
{%param//%}) 12. 327. 50 (commentator Vidyā-

{%kriyālopahiṃsādirahitāḥ paramasaṃskṛtāḥ,%}
cf. the note on this stanza in the Cr. Ed.);
but according to Bhīṣma when the king, in
any other Yuga, employed {%daṇḍanītī%} properly,
condition was as good as in the Kṛta Yuga
(12. 70. 7); in such a Kṛta Yuga, all the
three Varṇas offered Soma sacrifices according
to rites ({%some prayatnaṃ kurvanti trayo%}
{%varṇā yathāvidhi%}) (Editor's note on the
stanza: {%some = devatādīn uddiśya somayāge%})
and the Vedic rites were faultlessly performed
({%vaidikāni ca karmāṇi bhavanty aviguṇāny%}
[Page242-b+ 40]
{%uta%}) 12. 70. 9. {@J.@} Nature of the Kṛta
Yuga, its effects on men: Hanūmant told
Bhīma that the times in the Kṛta Yuga were
different from those in the other Yugas
({%anyaḥ kṛtayuge kālas tretāyāṃ dvāpare%}
{%paraḥ%}) 3. 148. 6; Kṛta Yuga described by
different persons: (1) by Hanūmant to
Bhīma 3. 148. 11-22 (Kṛta Yuga was com-
pletely free from the three qualities (viz.
{%sattva, rajas%} and {%tamas%}) ({%traiguṇyapari-%}
{%varjitam%} 3. 148. 22); (2) by Vaiśaṃpāyana
to Janamejaya 1. 58. 8-24 ({%kāle gāvaḥ%}
{%prasūyante nāryaś ca bharatarṣabha/%}
{%phalanty ṛtuṣu vṛkṣāś ca puṣpāṇi ca%}

ṇḍeya to the Pāṇḍavas 3. 189. 8-13 ({%ṣaṭ-%}

189. 12-13); (4) by Bhīṣma to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira (when a king in any Yuga practised
{%daṇḍanīti%} properly) 12. 70. 8-13 (the quali-
ties of Kṛta age are called {%kārtayugān guṇgān%}
12. 70. 13, also {%kārtayugadharmāṇo bhāgāḥ%}
12. 327. 50); (5) by Saṃjaya to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra 6. 11. 8-9; in general the people of
the Kṛta Yuga were possessed of fortitude,
were diligent in their duties, knew the proper
time for the use of valour ({%dhṛtimantaś ca%}
{%dakṣāś ca sve sve karmaṇi bhārata/parā-%}
{%kramavidhānajñā narāḥ kṛtayuge 'bhavan%})
3. 159. 2; the ascetics of the Kṛta Yuga were
calm and they remained steady in the {%sattva%}
quality ({%tapasvinaḥ praśāntāś ca sattvasthāś%}
{%ca kṛte yuge%}) 12. 230. 7 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
12. 238. 7: {%praśāntāḥ niḥsaṃśayāḥ%}); all the
ascetics then made no distinction between
{%pauruṣa, daiva%} and {%svabhāva%} as the cause
of the success in {%karma%} and had neither love
nor hatred for the {%ṛcs,%} the {%yajuses%} and the
[Page243-a+ 40]
{%sāmans;%} hence they practised austerities (and
did not perform sacrifices) {%apṛthagdarśinaḥ%}

{%kṛtayuge 'nutiṣṭhantīti śeṣaḥ%}); when Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura were born the
country of the Kurus ({%kurujāṅgalam%}), the
Kurus themselves and the Kurukṣetra, all
prospered 1. 102. 1; at that time a condition
similar to the Kṛta Yuga prevailed in the
regions of the different kingdoms ({%prade-%}
{%śeṣv api rāṣṭrāṇāṃ kṛtam yugam avartata%})
1. 102. 5; this condition is described in 1.
102. 2-11; people in the Kṛta Yuga did not
have to cohabit to beget children, they could
have them by mere thought ({%na caiṣāṃ%}
{%maithuno dharmo babhūva bharatarṣabha/%}
{%saṃkalpād eva caiteṣām apatyam udapad-%}

tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas etc.
in the south and the Yaunas (Yavanas),
Kāmbojas etc. in the north did not exist on the
earth 12. 200. 39-43; there were no {%bhikṣus%}
and those who have sectarian marks ({%liṅgi-%}
{%naḥ%}); similarly there were no alternatives to
the four {%āśramas;%} all this happened when the
Kṛta Yuga passed away and the {%daṇḍanīti%}
was no longer practised—thus Indra told to
Māndhātṛ 12. 65. 24-25. {@K.@} Expecta-
tion of life: In the Kṛta Yuga people were
free from diseases, succeeded in achieving all
objectives and lived for four hundred years
({%arogāḥ sarvasiddhārthāś caturvarṣaśatā-%}
{%yuṣaḥ/kṛte%}) 12. 224. 24; however, according
[Page243-b+ 39]
to Saṃjaya people lived for four thousand
years ({%catvāri ca sahasrāṇi varṣāṇāṃ%}
{%kurusattama/āyuḥsaṃkhyā kṛtayuge saṃ-%}
{%khyātā rājasattama//%}) 6. 11. 5 (apparently
there is confusion between the duration of
the Kṛta Yuga (above section {@C@}) and life-
expectancy of human beings); also cf.
{%sahasraśatajīvinaḥ tāḥ prajāḥ … // … evaṃ%}
{%kṛtayuge samyag vartamāne tadā nṛpa%})
1. 58. 10, 24; men lived as long as they liked
and they had no fear of Yama 12. 200. 34;
({%na kṣīyante ca vai prajāḥ%}) 3. 148. 11;
({%nālpāyur dṛśyate naraḥ%}) 12. 70. 11; but
the life expectation, virility etc. decrease
successively in the Yugas that follow the
Kṛta ({%āyur vīryam atho buddhir … manu-%}
{%ṣyāṇām anuyugaṃ hrasatīti nibodha me%}) 3.
188. 13. {@L.@} Kṛta as the name of Sūrya:
Kṛta appears among the 108 names of Sūrya
taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22.
{@M.@} Etymology: The etymology is implied
when it is said that in the Kṛta Yuga
(whatever needs be done) is done and does
not remain undone ({%kṛtam eva na karta-%}
